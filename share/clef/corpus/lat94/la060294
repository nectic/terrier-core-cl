JAZZ REVIEW; BETTY BRYANT TURNS THE TABLES ON A COCKTAIL CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when martini lounges and coffeehouses host bevies of song stylists 
and wanna-be divas, Betty Bryant is the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran vocalist and pianist showed Tuesday at her Spaghettini appearance 
just what it takes to win over a crowd intent on hobnob and conversation. Her 
warm, narrative vocal style and smart ways at the keyboard were all it took to 
turn the assembled from their cocktails and conversation toward the melodious 
stories she offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant has had plenty of experience at this kind of thing. She spent the past 
several years as a regular at Bob Burns in Santa Monica while making frequent 
appearances in Los Angeles jazz clubs. Her appearance a few years back at the 
San Juan Capistrano Library, where no drinks were served and the audience hung 
on her every note, transformed the facility's La Sala performance space into an 
intimate, club-like setting. 
</P>
<P>
 At Spaghettini, she had to struggle for that kind of attention. But not too 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's one of Bryant's great attractions. She's at ease no matter how loud 
the competing din. Eyes closed and smiling, she scats along in unison, 
sometimes just off mike, with her piano lead, or croons easily while revealing 
a lyric's deepest content. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's appearance was a reunion of sorts, finding the singer paired after a 
year's hiatus with a longtime partner, bassist Greg Eicher, who first met 
Bryant when both were regulars on the Kansas City club scene. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if there'd never been an interruption in their teaming, as the two 
proceeded to complement each other in almost telepathic terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reading of "Willow Weep for Me" played on the tune's obvious blues 
foundations, with Bryant giving wide spacing to a series of chords on the 
chorus before Eicher gave a glistening, bowed solo. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice was playful and vibrant on "Straighten Up and Fly Right," with a few 
spoken phrases for emphasis. "It Could Happen to You" was done in a deliberate 
style, a technique that carried a feeling of joy when she reached the chorus. 
She sang "Quiet Nights" in melodious Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 During the second set, Bryant showcased some of her own tunes: the novelty 
number "Put a Lid On It" ("When it comes to blabbermouths / You're No. 1 . . . 
"), the light ditty "Come and Laugh With Me" and the moving ballad "Whatever 
Happened to You" ("Though you're here beside me / I know you're gone . . . "). 
All are fine efforts in the standard tradition and serve as swell vehicles for 
Bryant's intimate delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a pianist, Bryant offered just enough technique to be impressive, while 
staying more to a tune's melodic attractions. As with her vocal phrasing, she 
likes to play with the pacing, opening up the rhythms by trailing behind the 
beat or waiting until the last moment to close a phrase. Better yet, she has an 
ear for inserting blues touches at just the right point. 
</P>
<P>
 Though her style, especially her piano playing, is more dense than the spare 
delivery of Shirley Horn, Bryant seems of Horn's caliber, and aspiring young 
vocalists cluttering the scene would do well to give her a listen. She'll 
return to Spaghettini on June 21 and again on June 28.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ENERGETIC JUICE NEWTON: THE RIGHT PACE AT THE RIGHT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NOEL DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "We're smokin' now," Juice Newton noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time she played the Crazy Horse Steak House, in November of '92, 
she'd been rendered all but tuneless by a bad cold. But Tuesday night she was 
back in gear with music that was sparking palpable excitement among the crowd. 
Her string of pop and country hits may have trickled out in the late '80s, but 
she still can pack this place every time she comes to town. 
</P>
<P>
 This 14-song, one-hour, 10-minute show found her covering all her bases, from 
energetic country rock ("Queen of Hearts") to melodramatic ballads ("Angel of 
the Morning"). Her pacing was brilliant: She opened with the lively "When Love 
Comes Around the Bend" from her 1989 album, "Ain't Gonna Cry," and built 
steadily, ending with her biggest hit, "The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)." 
</P>
<P>
 As she rounded the home stretch, her dramatic reading of "Break It to Me 
Gently" (a hit for Brenda Lee in 1962 and for Newton 20 years later) earned her 
a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Her five-piece band gave her plenty of firepower for the rockers and was 
equally adept at slowing down to provide sympathetic accompaniment to the love 
songs. More than just fine pickers, the musicians also enhanced the show's 
visual appeal, synchronizing their moves with the star's. You should have seen 
them all bouncing back and forth together during "Love's Been a Little Bit Hard 
on Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lead guitarist Otha Young stepped into the spotlight several times to let 
loose with hot solos, most notably during Newton's rousing 1987 hit, "Tell Me 
True." Young and Newton have been playing together since they were in college 
more than 20 years ago, and by now they've practically merged into a single 
musical entity. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the show was an acoustic interlude. The spare 
instrumentation made for a welcome contrast to the full-throttle approach of 
the rest of the set and lent a new sound to some familiar hits. "Old Flame" was 
accompanied only by a piano. Young exchanged his guitar for a mandolin for 
"Falling in Love." And "Ride 'Em Cowboy," played on unamplified guitars, 
sounded like a throwback to Newton and Young's early years as folkies. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the evening, Newton's sense of humor kept shining through. In 
response to the aircraft-like whine of some feedback, she quipped: "Who's 
landing?" And even during her dramatic pause at the climax of "Break It to Me 
Gently," she couldn't refrain from cracking: "I know it's a cheap trick."

 'The Flintstones,' Live: If box-office success translates into theme park 
attendance, Universal Studios Hollywood should be swamped this summer when it 
opens "The Flintstones Show" on June 18. The live, interactive stage show marks 
the first time in Universal Studios' 30-year history that it will open a major 
new attraction while the film on which it is based is still in theaters. Billed 
as the most extensive live stage spectacular ever conceived by Universal, "The 
Flintstones Show" follows Fred, Barney, Wilma, Betty and Dino to Hollyrock, 
USA, where Fred is chosen to star in the world's first "rock" video by 
"Univershell Pictures."

 Middlebrook Joins LACE: Photographer Willie Middlebrook, who is fighting the 
city's Cultural Affairs Department over his ouster as director of the Watts 
Towers Arts Center, has been appointed exhibitions director of Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions. In his new position, he will coordinate LACE's 
exhibition program and curate two shows each year. Middlebrook was removed from 
the Watts Towers directorship a year ago and terminated from city employment in 
April, under charges that he had falsified neighborhood workers' time sheets. 
He denies the charges and has filed an appeal, which will be heard next 
Wednesday by the Civil Service Commission. "I just want to clear my record," 
Middlebrook said of the hearing, adding that he sees the LACE position as "an 
advancement" and has no desire to return to his former job. LACE opens its new 
Hollywood space June 16. STAGE

 Cutbacks Bring Layoffs: The two senior vice presidents of Theatre Corp. of 
America who were directly responsible for choosing shows for the Pasadena

Dixon, who worked at the Playhouse, and Martin Wiviott, who produced the Alex 
shows, were dismissed. Lars Hansen, the company's executive vice president and 
chief operating officer, will temporarily take on their duties. QUICK TAKES

MUSIC REVIEWS; GRETA COOLS OFF ITS ABRASIVE POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been nearly a year since Greta has played in L.A., and a lot has changed 
for the local quartet. Its blend of abrasive pop with a dramatic cabaret appeal 
was once the center of a buzz and bidding war, leading to a debut album 
released by Mercury last year.But at the Whisky on Tuesday, the band seemed to 
have lost the demanding and arrogant attitude that made it alluring the first 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer and guitarist Paul Plagen still went from raging mad to vaudeville 
campy to twistedly nervous, but it was without his original daredevil extremes. 
His highs and lows -- from the shrill tones of Rush's Geddy Lee to guttural 
growls -- were more even-keel, dulling his sassy luster. But the singer -- just 
returned to the band from a stint in substance abuse rehab, during which he was 
temporarily replaced by a sub singer -- did still wear a dress, this time a 
brown floral number, complete with a beaded choker.  
</P>
<P>
 The music also seemed to lose some of its dynamics. It came out chaotic, 
assaulting and shapeless, with little breathing space in between the 
repetitious grinds. A few catchy numbers at the end came to life, including a 
sinisterly sweet cover of "Pennies From Heaven." LORRAINE ALI

MUSIC REVIEWS; MEAT PUPPETS STILL HAVE DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The standard take on the Meat Puppets these days is that the veteran group, 
having helped define alternative rock's independent spirit and musical freedom, 
has been bypassed by time and trends -- like a once-important little town left 
isolated by a distant interstate that has drawn all the traffic away.  
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona-based group's commercial momentum may be on the downgrade -- 
consider that it's soon to be the opening act for Stone Temple Pilots, who were 
just tots when Curt and Cris Kirkwood began blasting their folk- and 
country-tinged psychedelia out of the punk-rock scene -- but at the Roxy on 
Tuesday the Puppets played like a band with something at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kirkwood brothers, longtime drummer Derrick Bostrom and added guitarist 
Troy Meiss were like an around-the-bend Crazy Horse as they set off explosions 
of wildly virtuosic guitar rock, moving at amazing speed while locked in 
seemingly telepathic interplay. An accelerated Johnny Cash beat here, tight, 
tart bluegrass harmonies there and a couple of acoustic numbers expanded the 
range of a sound that shows signs of enduring as the classic rock of the punk 
generation. RICHARD CROMELIN

MOVIE REVIEW; A 'LOVE' STORY WOVEN WITH COMPASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R.W. Fassbinder's superbly understated "I Only Want You to Love Me," made for 
German TV, arrives 18 years after its completion and nearly 12 years after its 
prodigious maker's untimely death, at once underlining its own timelessness and 
the great loss to world cinema in general and to German films in particular 
caused by Fassbinder's passing. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many talented German filmmakers, but none has had quite the unique, 
sustained and far-ranging impact of Fassbinder. The consolation is that at his 
death at 36 he left behind an incredibly rich legacy of 28 plays, three radio 
plays and no less than 43 films, a number of which have yet to surface in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Fassbinder was one of the first openly gay filmmakers in the world, but his 
strength lay in his ability to empathize no less with straights than with gays. 
Based on a true incident, "I Only Want You to Love Me" is a perfect case in 
point, a study of a young married man Fassbinder views with the utmost 
compassion as he proceeds to his fate with a remorseless inevitability. 
</P>
<P>
 In flashback we witness the stark childhood of a boy born in a small Bavarian 
town to hard-working parents -- they run a restaurant and live above it -- who 
are both perfectionists and severe disciplinarians, absolutely lacking in any 
capacity for affection for their only child. Their son Peter grows up 
obediently to be an understandably shy young man (Vitus Zeplichal) but with a 
quiet determination not to be the failure his father predicts he will be. 
</P>
<P>
 At first it looks as if Peter will prove his father wrong. A pleasant-looking 
young man, he attracts a young woman, Erika (Elke Aberle), as ordinary in 
appearance as he, but capable both of appreciating him and of making the 
initial overtures between them. A first-rate bricklayer who in his spare time 
has built his parents a sizable home (for which he receives no thanks), he 
marries Erika and dares to seek his fortune in Munich, where he quickly finds 
employment in construction and where his zeal and ability are recognized by his 
boss and co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter seemingly has the wherewithal to make something of his life, but his 
arrival in Munich coincides with West Germany's economic miracle. Munich is one 
the most beautiful and sophisticated of European cities, but it's also a 
shoppers' paradise. Material goods abound, along with inducements to buy them. 
Peter, starved for love his entire life, believes that the way to secure his 
wife's love is to keep buying her things. Erika is at once more mature and 
sensible than Peter, but it's beyond her ability to comprehend or to control 
her husband's compulsive spending. Surely, something's going to have to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Fassbinder draws from his cast, in particular Zeplichal and Aberle -- and also 
from esteemed veteran actress Johanna Hofer as Aberle's gentle grandmother -- 
the remarkably complete and selfless portrayals that are his trademark. 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC REVIEW; POGORELICH'S DEMANDING PIANO PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there is a more self-indulgent pianist in the world today than Ivo 
Pogorelich, we wouldn't like to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, calling Pogorelich self-indulgent is like calling a giraffe 
long-necked. The man who walked out on Karajan has made a career out of 
following his own lights, and, in an era of objective pianism, he must sound 
like a visionary to some. 
</P>
<P>
 In a makeup concert for a canceled date in March, Tuesday night at Ambassador 
Auditorium in Pasadena, that field of vision seemed limited to what the 
35-year-old Croatian sees in the mirror each morning. In this physically 
demanding program of Mussorgsky and Chopin, the pianist saw himself and beheld 
that it was good. 
</P>
<P>
 The very fact that he started with "Pictures at an Exhibition" speaks volumes, 
and the interpretation that ensued was so willful that one half-expected him to 
start laughing maniacally and declare, "Foolish Mussorgsky! Your music is mere 
putty in my hands!" 
</P>
<P>
 But, for all his thunder and lightning, fortissimo and pianissimo, push and 
pull, theatrical bluster and histrionic hush, the "Pictures" never came into 
view. The pianist's technical wizardry made the composer's oxcart into an 
18-wheeler, his Samuel Goldenberg into a behemoth. When Pogorelich began "The 
Great Gate at Kiev" colossally, one wondered where he could go with it, but he 
managed to jack it up even further by the end. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission came more of the same, with the four Scherzos of Chopin 
preceded by the brief Prelude, Opus 45. Again brutal pounding, again stretching 
phrases out of shape, again distortion of rhythm. In the simple melodic 
sections of these scores, the pianist chose to provide accompaniments of 
ravishing color, slapping out the melody above, prodding and pushing them, and 
then delaying cadences as long as possible. It became a mannerism and it became 
tedious. TIMOTHY MANGAN

 Sure, they've heard about condoms, AIDS and all the rest, but 1 million 
teen-age girls are getting pregnant each year. That statistic has serious 
ramifications not only for the health and well-being of these young women and 
their children but also for society at large, sparking increasing debate about 
cost, values and responsibility, both male and female.

 "Jacqui's Dilemma," tonight's involving ABC special for young people and 
parents, personalizes the issue through a fictional 16-year-old (Melissa 
Thompson) who finds herself pregnant. As she struggles with shock, denial, 
grief and fear, trying to make a decision, we hear real-life comments from 
teen-age boys and girls, psychologists, teachers, social workers, clergy 
members and others -- including Dr. Joycelyn Elders, the fearlessly outspoken 
U.S. surgeon general.

<P>
 Girls speak of pressure from boys to have sex; boys swagger as they say, 
"You're not going to stop at third base," and pronounce condoms as an 
inconvenience. Yet they turn sober when asked what it would mean if they were 
forced to be responsible for a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Jacqui keep the baby (her mother says it will ruin her life), give it up 
(only 5% of real teens do) or have an abortion (her dad says that would be 
killing)? The program, written and directed by Eamon Harrington and John 
Watkin, offers no blanket answer; instead, it provides straight talk from all 
sides that could help prevent some young people from having to face such a 
life-altering crisis in the first place. * "Jacqui's Dilemma" airs 8-9 p.m. 
tonight on ABC (Channels 7 and 3). LYNNE HEFFLEY

 When you say tuna , you might mean a grill-marked fillet streaked with 
squiggles of cilantro-lime-jalapeno puree; when you say tuna fish , though, you 
mean canned tuna. In "The Tuna Fish Gourmet" (Villard Books), Tracy Seaman 
means to elevate this universal American ingredient with 75 novel tuna fish 
recipes. They include tuna tabbouleh and curried tuna with wild rice, but as if 
to prove the solid worth of our traditions, nearly half the recipes are for 
salads or sandwiches. Weirdest: tuna and marmalade on toast ("for marmalade 
lovers only," Seaman observes). Flipper? Is That You?

 Buckeye Beans, creator of the now well-known Baseball Pasta, also makes 
Playful Dolphin Pasta, shaped like a leaping dolphin: (800) 449-2121, Dept.

tuna tetrazzini sauce from "The Tuna Fish Gourmet" (We hasten to add that 
neither Buckeye Beans nor Tracy Seaman has suggested this.) D Day Dishes

 Ah, the cooking of World War II, when money was tight and meat, eggs and sugar 
were rationed. You just had to be there. You can recreate the era, though, with 
the 10 recipes in a pamphlet-style cookbook titled "Served With Love," released 
to coincide with the 50th anniversary of D Day, June 6. Samples: a strudel that 
raised money for Gateway Hospital in Los Angeles (and didn't use eggs or 
sugar); a Kool-Aid pie. The recipes, together with memories and comments, were 
volunteered by residents of an Orange County retirement community, and the $3 
price goes to nonprofit organizations. Available from Palm Terrace Retirement 
and Health Care Community in Laguna Hills, 24962 Calle Aragon, Laguna Hills.

 Last October the Kyolic company, long known for its garlic-extract capsules, 
introduced an enzyme product for breaking down the indigestible sugars in beans 
which cause gas. Be Sure works like Beano (you take it with your first bite of 
the gassy food), but it's in capsule form, which some people may find more 
convenient. Blister packs of Be Sure are available at drug stores and 
supermarkets; if you can't find it, call the Gas Busters hotline for a free 
sample: (800) 688-3933. OK, Be Sure showed up in October. What just brought it 
to our attention was a list of gassy health foods it works with, including 
adzuki, lupins and horse gram. Big Crawdaddy

HOT SALSA; STOKING THE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple of months ago, one of the food-fear stories that periodically 
stampede the public made the news rounds. This time a study was said to have 
shown chile peppers to be associated with stomach cancer. Some people started 
looking uneasy at lunch and waving away the hot sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The story eventually died down. People went back to thinking of chiles as an 
excellent source of vitamins -- raw peppers, even mild ones, are among the most 
concentrated sources of Vitamin C in nature, and ripe red peppers are among the 
best for Vitamin A. And it should be noted that the stomach cancer rate has 
declined in this country over the last 20 years, while chile-eating has 
quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancer scare was evidently just a blip in the rising trend of chile 
consumption. Even five years ago, hardly anybody had ever heard of the Scoville 
test. (For those who still don't know, it measures the strength of a pepper by 
dilutability; a ranking of 5,000 Scoville units means you could dilute a sample 
of the chile in question with 5,000 times as much water and still taste 
hotness.) Today, hot sauce makers casually boast about their Scoville ratings, 
confident that whether or not people know exactly what they mean (and the 
Scoville test is notoriously subjective), Scoville units in the thousands are 
what chile-heads want to hear about. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the habanero pepper is the hottest chile available, either 
fresh or bottled. The chile writer Jean Andrews reports, however, that there 
are chiles in South America that make the habanero look like a bell pepper, so 
it's only a matter of time before we see aji rocoto in our supermarkets. 
Eventually we'll find, or gene-splice, absolutely the hottest pepper in the 
world, and what will the chile-heads do then? 
</P>
<P>
 They'll still have new territories to explore. After all, in its natural 
state, the hot stuff in chiles -- a group of chemicals called capsaicinoids -- 
is diluted with all sorts of inessential ingredients such as, oh, vitamins and 
flavoring elements. Those who really want to set their mouths on fire, throw 
their metabolisms into a whirl and pop sweat from their brows like Donald Duck 
can start messing with the pure item: industrial capsaicin extract. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of us will probably settle for a medium burn, an appetizing aroma and 
nutrients, stuff like that.

 The combination of chipotle peppers and balasmic vinegar in this recipe is 
nothing short of inspired -- the smoky peppers complement the vinegar, its 
slight sweetness balances the peppers. This marinade would make a great sauce 
for any kind of barbecue. The recipe comes from Bruce J. Auden of Restaurant 
Biga in San Antonio, Texas, who recommends serving it with a salad of 
watercress, julienned jicama and orange segments dressed with hot pepper oil. 
To garnish the chops decoratively with the mint cream, he uses a plastic 
ketchup-type bottle. From "Red Hot Peppers" by Jean Andrews (MacMillan: 1993). 
CHIPOTLE-MARINATED LAMB CHOPS 1 (7-ounce) can chipotle chiles en adobo 3/4 cup 
plus 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 6 cloves garlic 6 sprigs fresh oregano 2 
bunches cilantro 16 lamb chops cut from rack 2 tablespoons olive oil 4 carrots, 
cut into 2-inch julienne 4 leeks, well rinsed and cut into 2-inch julienne 2 
cups chicken stock 12 small tomatoes, seeded and chopped Mint Cream 
</P>
<P>
 Combine chipotles, 3/4 cup balsamic vinegar, garlic, oregano and 1 bunch 
cilantro in blender or food processor. Puree and pour into mixing bowl. Holding 
by bone, dip each lamb chop into puree. Keep bone dry. Cover chops and marinate 
overnight in refrigerator, or 3 hours at room temperature. Reserve chipotle 
puree. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place chops in 
hot pan and cook 4 minutes per side. Transfer skillet with chops to 350-degree 
oven 5 minutes. May have to be done in batches. Remove skillet from oven. 
Transfer chops to serving dish and keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Place skillet on medium heat and pour in remaining 1 tablespoon balsamic 
vinegar. Reduce while scraping lamb juices and marinade from bottom of pan. For 
hotter sauce, add reserved chipotle puree to taste. Add carrots and leeks, 
keeping to 1 side of skillet. Chop remaining bunch cilantro, reserving few 
sprigs for garnish. Add to skillet with chicken stock and tomatoes. Reduce heat 
to low and cook until sauce starts to thicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove carrots and leeks to serving plate. Pour sauce into blender or food 
processor and process until smooth with some chunks. Place lamb chops on 
carrots and leeks and pour sauce over. Garnish with Mint Cream and reserved 
cilantro sprigs. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Canned chipotle chiles are available in most supermarkets and Latino 
grocery stores.

HOT SALSA; TABASCO: IT WAS HOT WHEN HOT WASN'T COOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For its first 100 years or so, Tabasco sauce was the hottest thing most 
Americans ever tasted. The McIlhenny Co.'s big job was to get people over their 
fear of hotness. Official Tabasco recipes have always counseled subtlety and 
moderation. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the last 25 years, Americans have been eating hotter and hotter. 
First, Mexican food entered the mainstream. Then jalapeno-eating contests, Thai 
food and chili cook-offs showed up. In the late '80, a fringe of chile-loons 
began questing for ever hotter flavors, and slowly the public taste shifted 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the jalapeno no longer symbolized the ultimate threshold of pain; 
in some restaurants it became a pepper for stuffing, as if it were a poblano or 
a bell pepper. The super-hot Caribbean chiles known as habaneros or Scotch 
bonnets were now the names to conjure with. And today, in the '90s, you can get 
fresh habaneros right at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, there's an explosion in pepper use," says McIlhenny Co. vice 
president Paul McIlhenny. "Look at all the books, posters, magazines, 
boutiques. It's helpful to us. If people lose their fear of peppers, it helps 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco sales are booming -- Southern California is now Tabasco's biggest 
market; Northern California is No.3 -- but in the current chile madness it 
wouldn't do to rest on one's laurels. Last year the McIlhenny Co. bought its 
long-time Louisiana rival Trappey's and reworked a couple of Trappey's products 
under the Tabasco name. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a jalapeno sauce (well balanced, good jalapeno flavor, more aromatic 
but less hot than Tabasco), the other is called New Orleans Style Steak Sauce 
(like A-1 sauce, but spicier, sweeter and with a pronounced orange-peel aroma). 
A Caribbean-Style Steak Sauce is being developed along the lines of a Jamaican 
jerk sauce, complete with mango, tamarind and allspice. 
</P>
<P>
 But McIlhenny's is in an odd position. Despite all those years as the 
proverbial extreme of hotness, it is a supermarket brand and has to bear in 
mind the taste of the general public, not just that of the chile-loons. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: To give the new steak sauce the genuine Tabasco stamp, some 
pureed pulp of barrel-aged Tabasco chiles is added. However, peppers naturally 
vary a little in hotness. In a sauce used by the drop, such as Tabasco, a 
little variation doesn't matter much, but the first batch of the steak sauce 
turned out hotter than Paul McIlhenny figured the supermarkets could stand. "I 
didn't want to throw away 400 cases of steak sauce," he says genially, "so I 
just slapped an 'extra spicy' label on it. You can get it only on the Island 
(Avery Island, La., site of the Tabasco Co.), or by writing to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The original Tabasco sauce is basically unchanged, though it is no longer made 
with peppers grown on Avery Island. "In the late '60s, when I started with the 
company," says McIlhenny, "we still farmed our own peppers. But then the local 
Louisiana labor market dried up. Instead of importing migrant workers, we tried 
farming in Mexico, but we had problems of plant disease and flooding down 
there. Now we raise 90% of our peppers in Central America." 
</P>
<P>
 These days the ground fresh peppers come up to Louisiana in stainless-steel 
tanker trucks, each holding 100 barrels. The mash is still aged on Avery 
Island, spending three years in oak barrels. McIlhenny inspects every barrel 
before it's mixed with vinegar to make the sauce. "We skim off a couple of 
inches of oxidized mash," he says, "then take a fluorescent lamp and look at 
the color, smell the aroma." He adds, with the faintest of winks, "We don't 
taste it." 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, in today's hot chile climate, the McIlhenny Co. is working on a 
habanero sauce. "It won't just be a straight chile and vinegar sauce like 
Tabasco," says Paul McIlhenny. "It will have tomato and so on in it. The reason 
habanero sauces always have carrots and mangoes and stuff in them is to dilute 
the habaneros, they're so hot." Recognizing the different sauce-using 
tendencies of habanero fans, however, McIlhenny will not market it in the 
narrow-necked Tabasco bottle (which is actually a 19th-Century perfume bottle 
designed for dispensing drop by drop). 
</P>
<P>
 "But we do not plan a hotter version of Tabasco," he says. "We consider that 
sacrosanct."

HOT SALSA; IT'S A NAIVE, DOMESTIC HABANERO . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "This is a three-hankie experience," croaked a participant, blowing his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be a sign of the times. A distinct percentage of the people were using 
paper napkins for their running noses and watering eyes at this event. They had 
come here voluntarily, knowing what they were in for, at the first public hot 
sauce tasting in the Los Angeles area, held in Pasadena May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 There were sympathetic smiles for those who headed to the bar for something 
cold and wet to throw on the fire in their mouths. And conspiratorial grins for 
those who ordered Ed's Original Cave Creek Chili Beer. Your true chile-head 
likes the idea of a beer with a green chile floating in the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers provided evaluation sheets, but unlike those at a wine tasting, 
they didn't call for elaborate point totals, just subjective notes and one 
nomination each for hottest sauce and personal favorite. And nobody rolled 
sauce around in their mouths, sucked air over it, stared ruminatively and then 
spat it into a discreet cuspidor. They just swallowed and gasped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially this event was an easy, if not exactly painless, way of sampling 
22 unfamiliar hot sauces. They were arranged on three tables designated Medium, 
Hotter and Hottest. The Hottest table consisted exclusively of sauces based on 
the habanero pepper, currently the hottest chile available in this country. 
Some tasting notes from that table: 
</P>
<P>
 West Indies Creole Sauce: A traditional product from Dominica. Elegant and 
versatile, a habanero-based equivalent of Tabasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Spitfire Pepper Sauce: From Barbados. quite hot, enriched with mustard, cumin 
and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 Inner Beauty Real Hot Sauce: Made in Costa Rica. Also containing mustard and 
cumin, but with a touch of honey. 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda's XXXXtra Reserve '94: From Costa Rica. A dark red-orange 
vintage-dated habanero sauce containing onion, lime and carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 Vic's Fire: From Florida. Just vinegar and habaneros, so hot the 
medicinal-sized bottle comes with an eyedropper for dosing. 
</P>
<P>
 Pure Hell: From Colorado. Habanero with a touch of pineapple. 
</P>
<P>
 The last had a milder cousin on the Hotter table, named Half Way to Pure Hell. 
Surprisingly, there was actually a habanero sauce on the Medium-Hot table: 
Trinidad Mild, which emphasized something hotness-freaks don't often talk 
about, the really delicious aroma of the habanero chile, which is a bit like 
all fresh vegetables rolled into one. 
</P>
<P>
 Free of the Hottest table's single-minded concentration on the habanero, the 
Medium-Hot table had the greatest variety of styles. Salsa Nova Cilantro and 
Walnut was like a fresh chutney or some condiment from the Republic of Georgia. 
Coyote Cocina Fire-Roasted Salsa carried the smokiness of chipotle peppers to 
new levels. Pili Sauce, from Virginia, had an unexotic ingredient list 
(tomatoes, jalapenos, ginger), but the combination was very pleasing. 
Rothschild's Fiery Raspberry Salsa (Ohio) was sweet and delicious, a subtle 
hint of celery giving freshness to the combination of tomatoes, jalapenos, 
raspberry vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Bosserman-Lopez, of the Pasadena hot sauce boutique Hot Hot Hot, 
explained that she'd chosen the most unusual sauces for the Medium-Hot table 
"because they're the ones people are least likely to sample in the shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's just another sign of the times, like the fact that the Tabasco 
company, after 126 years in the hot sauce business, is thinking about bringing 
out its own habanero sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the sauce makers in attendance, Mike Greening (who manufactures the 
tart and hot Ring of Fire sauce in San Diego), was talking about how he's 
questing for even more fire by importing red habaneros from Barbados. 
</P>

 "They're more expensive," he said, "and they're a lot of trouble to import, 
but they come in at 325,000 on the Scoville scale. California orange habaneros 
are only 240,000 Scoville."  
</P>
<P>
 There was a wild light in his eye. And to think that once upon a time, the 
jalapeno, which has been ranked as high as 50,000 on the Scoville pungency 
scale, was considered pretty hot.

HOT SALSA / BOOK REVIEWS; BOOKS FOR POD PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years ago, when two friends and I were writing a chile pepper book, we 
figured we had the subject to ourselves. There were only two "hot" cookbooks in 
print, one mostly being a ramble through southern Lousiana and the other 
dwelling on (oh, how spicy!) Hungarian food. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we got our book finished, though, the dam had burst, and there's 
been a flood of chile books since. These days bookstores are likely to have a 
whole shelf full of titles like "Hot Peppers," "Hot" and "Hot, Hotter, 
Hottest." Here's a sampling of the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 * RED HOT PEPPERS: A Cookbook for the Not So Faint of Heart, By Jean Andrews ; 
(Macmillan: $25, 256 pp.).  
</P>
<P>
 Jean Andrews herself was a major dam-burster with her 1984 book "Peppers: The 
Domesticated Capsicums." It went into vastly more botanical detail about chile 
peppers than any popular book before or since, complemented by Andrews's 
striking, passionately observed watercolors of chile varieties.  
</P>
<P>
 To a degree, her new book, "Red Hot Peppers," is a repackage of the same 
material, including lots of botanical detail and her excellent illustrations 
(in this case delicately stippled drawings, rather than watercolor portraits), 
in a smaller, more affordable format. Since writing that first chile book, 
Andrews has gotten around -- visited the Far East, for instance -- and the new 
book also goes into some detail on how peppers are used in the world's 
cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the scholarly aims of her earlier book, Andrews opens the new 
one with a historical quibble: Why is it that only one chile species, Capsicum 
annuum, spread throughout the world, though it was not indigenous to the 
Caribbean islands that Columbus visited? Now, nobody loves a good quibble 
better than I do, but I wonder whether it was wise to start the book this way. 
I suspect not many readers are going to stay with Andrews (even with all her 
detailed maps) through a tortuous argument that revolves around the idea that 
Columbus actually could have found C. annuum in the Caribbean.  
</P>
<P>
 And if they do plow through this section, they may ask why they bothered. 
Sure, Columbus could have found C. annuum in the Caribbean; it would be amazing 
if he hadn't. He found corn there, and we know that corn, like C. annuum , was 
originally domesticated in Mexico. If a demanding crop like corn made it to the 
Caribbean islands in ancient times, chiles sure could have. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the experts who have claimed that C. chinense (the species to which 
habaneros belong) was the only one in the Caribbean are wrong, but the whole 
issue seems beside the point. We don't have to presume that the first species 
of chile Europeans saw would be the one to spread. As Andrews admits, the 
Mexican species is simply a lot better candidate for world popularity. C. 
chinense lacks sweet varieties, doesn't keep as well and is far more finicky 
about what climate it will grow in. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, after 20 pages in thickets like these, Andrews finds her way to 
open ground and gives the most detailed sketch yet to appear in a popular book 
of how peppers spread in the 16th Century. I have my own quibbles here, but 
they're small ones. For instance, she credits the Turks with taking peppers to 
Hungary, but it was clearly Croatian merchants from Dubrovnik ( paprika is the 
Croatian word for pepper plus a Slavic suffix added to plant names). This 
section may overwhelm you with detail, but you'll come away with an awed 
respect for the scale of international trade that was managed -- particularly 
when the cargo was spices -- in those days of wooden ships and toiling 
caravans. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the book contains plenty of the kind of great chile lore you 
expect from Jean Andrews, such as: What's the medical name for the chile 
"morning-after burn"? Jaloproctitis. Why have Americans come so late to the 
chile pepper party? It's not only the chile-less Northern European background 
of American cuisine -- it's that the Indians of North America didn't know of 
peppers, so they couldn't teach the pioneers about them. 
</P>
<P>
 As the subtitle "A Cookbook for the Not So Faint of Heart" suggests, the 
biggest difference between "Red Hot Peppers" and Andrews's earlier book is the 
emphasis on recipes, which fill half these pages. Given the scholarly approach 
in the rest of the book, you might expect nothing but specimen ethnic dishes, 
but au contraire , this is a diverse and sophisticated collection. Quite a few 
are from restaurant chefs, particularly fellow Texans such as Robert del 
Grande, Dean Fearing and Stephen Pyles. 
</P>
<P>
 It may seem odd, though, after all the tempting detail Andrews has given on 
scores of exotic peppers, that the recipes only call for chile varieties you 
can find in a supermarket. You can consider that a disappointment, if you're a 
cutting-edge foodie, or a relief, if you were actually hoping to cook out of 
this book. 
</P>
<P>
 * CHILE PEPPER FEVER: Mine's Hotter Than Yours; By Susan Hazen-Hammond with 
photos by Eduardo Fuss ; (Voyageur Press: $19.95, 124 pp.).  
</P>
<P>
 This book deserves note because it looks as if it belongs in the same category 
as Jean Andrews'. It contains only about a dozen recipes, but otherwise, like 
Andrew's book, the text is largely about science and history and the abundant 
illustrations are striking. (What am I saying? The illustrations are 
overwhelming . Eduardo Fuss's photos are so powerfully saturated with color 
they just about put your eye out.) 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no comparing this chatty, superficial, dimly organized book with 
"Red Hot Peppers." After a while you even get tired of the hyper-vivid photos, 
because so many of them are the same shot over and over: a close-up of a 
surface covered with colorful peppers (often not identified in the caption). 
The combination of highly polished photos and a gabby, meandering text gives 
"Chile Pepper Fever: Mine's Hotter Than Yours" the feeling of a very, very long 
National Geographic article. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE GREAT SALSA BOOK, By Mark Miller with Mark Kiffin and John Harrisson 
(Ten Speed Press: $14.95, 116 pp.)  
</P>
<P>
 Mark Miller, chef/owner of Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., and Red Sage in 
Washington, is a major chile booster. He published a guide to chile varieties 
("The Great Chile Book") three years ago, and his chile posters have gone up on 
kitchen walls all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 This book follows the same format as "The Great Chile Book" -- tall and 
narrow, lots of color photos -- but this time the subject is hot sauce recipes. 
Is it ever: fully 100 salsa recipes, each with stylish photograph by Valerie 
Santagto on the facing page. They're organized in 10 categories (with 10 
recipes each): tomato, chile, tropical fruit, non-tropical fruit, corn, bean, 
vegetable, nut/herb, seafood and exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of them are hot -- 5% contain no chiles at all -- and the idea of 
salsa is interpreted rather liberally. Some of these "salsas" could be 
described as relishes, some are really side dishes and one or two, particularly 
among the bean-based salsas, could be served on their own.  
</P>
<P>
 But there are a lot of intriguing ideas here. A sort of pumped-up mole poblano 
containing ancho chiles, dried tomatoes, coffee, prunes, toasted almonds, 
chipotle peppers and chocolate. Mangoes with lime juice, chile de arbol and 
fresh ginger juice. Roasted garlic, corn kernels, green chiles and beef or 
venison jerky. Seared pineapple chunks with chipotle, orange juice and brown 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 And those photos are gorgeous. Remember: Don't eat the pages. 
</P>
<P>
 * SALSAS, SAMBALS, CHUTNEYS AND CHOWCHOWS: Intensely Flavored "Little Dishes" 
From Around the World, By Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby (Morrow: $20, 
150 pp.)  
</P>
<P>
 Schlesinger and Willoughby are known for 1990's best-selling "The Thrill of 
the Grill," and this book too represents the highly flavored cooking that 
Schlesinger showcases at his East Coast Grill in Cambridge, Mass. It might not 
be quite fair to lump it in with chile books, though, because barely half of 
the recipes could be considered hot. They're what Schlesinger and Willoughby 
call "little dishes": not just salsas but Indian, Indonesian and South African 
condiments and old-fashioned American pickles, relishes and ketchups (they hold 
to the 19th-Century definition of a ketchup: a fruit, vegetable or nut sauce 
flavored with vinegar and spices). 
</P>
<P>
 This probably explains why "Salsas, Sambals, Chutneys and Chowchows" violates 
the chile book tradition of having a red color scheme, preferably with a 
suggestion of flames. Here, lax yellow or chartreuse squiggles run down through 
every page, giving the book a sort of Fifties patio-life feeling. The color 
photos that attend all the dishes also have the neutral, even texture of 
Fifties food photography, rather than the sharp-edged look particularly favored 
for spicy food nowadays.  
</P>
<P>
 You pay a bit for the casual, undemanding style, though. This is a spaciously 
arranged book, fitting only 42 recipes into its 150 pages. There's quite a bit 
of not-terribly-informative informational text; for instance, one whole page is 
devoted to a nice color photo of some tomatillos and two sentences explaining 
what they are. Don't say you haven't been warned. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipes, obviously a collection of the authors' personal favorites, are 
certainly easy to like. It's particularly nice to see a couple of those old 
Southern fresh pickles chowchow (sour, usually including cabbage with other 
vegetables) and piccalilli (ditto, only sweet-and-sour and including green 
tomatoes). 
</P>
<P>
 * HOT & SPICY & MEATLESS, By Dave DeWitt, Mary Jane Wilan and Melissa T. Stock 
(Prima Publishing: $12.95, 246 pp.).  
</P>
<P>
 This is the 12th chile pepper book from the Dave DeWitt chile pepper book 
factory, and the third co-authored with his wife, Mary Jane Wilan (the others 
being "The Food Lover's Handbook to the Southwest" and "Callaloo, Calypso and 
Carnival"). DeWitt is the New Mexico-based editor of Chile Pepper Magazine; 
Stock is also an editor at Chile Pepper. In the intro the three authors stress 
that they're not vegetarians. Apparently they decided to write this book simply 
because they had acquired a lot of vegetarian recipes, from their own 
experimentation or from friends and "far-flung correspondents," over the last 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The book certainly reads that way. Some of the recipes are rather original 
(black beans with chipotles, pasillas and bourbon), quite a few are pretty 
traditional Southwestern or Caribbean dishes, but most look as if they have 
come from full-time vegetarians or people who have to avoid flavoring elements 
like butter and salt. I'm particularly thinking of the spiced-up versions of 
traditional vegetarian dishes from all over (hot coleslaw, habanero lasagna, 
spicy ratatouille, tabbouleh with serrano peppers, French fries with red pepper 
and cilantro-spiked ketchup).  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the recipes are a little odd (the idea of dill in caponata may give 
some people the creeps), but in general, this book does what it sets out to do: 
It gives vegetarian dishes flavored with hot peppers. The recipes -- even when 
unfortunately named, such as hotsy hummus or tempting tempeh fajitas -- are 
livelier than you'd find in most vegetarian cookbooks, which tend to the sweet, 
rather than the hot, and most would go down easy even with non-vegetarians.

AMERICA'S BEST: QUARK AND CHEVRE . . . FROM VERMONT, OF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen years ago, the only American cheeses readily available were a few aged 
types or those individually wrapped squares of processed stuff. Today, there 
are more of the aged varieties to choose from, but your chances of finding 
freshly made cheeses are still pretty slim.  
</P>
<P>
 When Allison Hooper and Robert Reese of the Vermont Butter & Cheese Company 
began making goat cheese in 1984, there were only two other manufacturers in 
the entire United States. Three years later, their creamy, slightly tart chevre 
had won a blue ribbon at the annual American Cheese Society judging, and the 
partners had started making other varieties of fresh cheese and dairy products, 
including a French-style creme fraiche , mascarpone (the slightly tangy Italian 
version of cream cheese), quark (a low-fat German cheese that's a cross between 
sour cream and yogurt), and fromage blanc (a soft cheese made from skimmed 
cow's milk, used in sauces, spread on toast, or eaten as the French do with 
cream and sugar on top). 
</P>
<P>
 Hooper and Reese wholesale the award-winning cheeses mainly to restaurants, 
hotels, and specialty stores. Their customers range from the Grand Hyatt hotels 
and New York's top-rated Lutece and An American Place restaurants to many of 
the small cafes on New York's westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hotels and French restaurants buy the creme fraiche ," says Reese. "The 
Italians buy the mascarpone. The restaurants using the quark and fromage blanc 
tend to be somewhat creative. The goat cheese is all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 By UPS, six (eight ounce) containers of fromage blanc , mascarpone, creme 
fraiche , or quark cost $23.40. Six (four ounce) logs of goat cheese cost 
$24.60. Or try the country gourmet sampler -- three (four ounce) logs of che 
vre (plain, herb and pink pepper), and two (eight ounce) containers each of 
creme fraiche , fromage blanc and mascarpone -- for $32.40 (including 
shipping). Except for the che vre and fromage blanc , which may be frozen, the 
cheese is best eaten as soon as possible after purchase. Vermont Butter & 
Cheese Company Pitman Road, P.O. Box 95 Websterville, Vt. 05678 (802) 479-9371

WINE: A WINE NAMED SUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're thinking about starting a winery, it would seem that the least 
worrisome thing would be picking the name for your product. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's what Lou Preston thought. A jovial grape grower in the north 
end of Sonoma County's Dry Creek Valley, Preston has always liked cute names on 
the wines of his Preston Vineyards and Winery. Some years ago, he made a blend 
of Petite Sirah and Syrah that he called Syrah Sirah. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently he made a delightful red wine blended from Rhone grapes. He called 
the wine Faux Castel -- a take-off on the famous Rhone winery Beaucastel. The 
label was identical to all other Preston labels; there was no effort to 
redesign the label to look like the one used at Beaucastel. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the potential for conflict was obvious, especially since the Perrin 
family, owners of Beaucastel, own vineyard land in California -- in the Paso 
Robles area of San Luis Obispo Country -- and have planted vines, intending to 
make an American version of their Rhone wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not being particularly litigious, Preston wrote the Perrins, seeking to 
resolve any conflict before it reached the legal stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Hamel, the winemaker at Preston, says the winery sent copies of the 
labels to the Perrins. "They've been friends of ours for a number of years, and 
we wanted to make sure they knew what our intentions were," says Hamel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Perrins admitted that it was very entertaining, but they said they 
preferred we not use the name again," said Hamel. "We respectfully said, 'OK, 
fair enough, we will change it.' " So with the current 1992 vintage of the 
wine, the only word on the label is Faux ; the Castel is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamel says that in addition to false, faux means imaginary. The wine is 
neither. It is a superb blend of 23% Carignane, 23% Grenache, 16% Mourvedre, 
37% Syrah and 1% Zinfandel. At $9 it's a delightful wine, loaded with berry-ish 
fruit and just enough tannin to parry with rich foods. 
</P>
<P>
 This name game ended quietly. No legal salvos were fired. Other arguments have 
been settled far more bloodily. 
</P>
<P>
 * In one of the most egregious examples, the E & J Gallo Winery of Modesto, 
the world's largest, sued the Italian trade group that represents Chianti 
growers -- claiming the phrase " gallo nero " the Italians had used since 1922 
infringed on a name the U. S. winery had made famous, even though the Gallo 
Nero had been in business 11 years longer than Gallo. After years of legal 
battles, the Italian group found legal costs excessive and capitulated. It 
agreed not to use its own language ( gallo nero means black rooster in Italian) 
on its labels. In a final bit of irony, Gallo continues to make a wine called 
Chianti. 
</P>
<P>
 * But the Gallo Nero people shouldn't take that dispute personally. The Gallo 
brothers, Ernest and his late brother Julio, sued their younger brother, 
Joseph, to prevent him from marketing cheese under the Gallo name. The older 
brothers prevailed. Today the name on Joe Gallo's cheeses says it comes from 
Joseph Farms. 
</P>
<P>
 * In one of the most celebrated name-conflict cases, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, 
owned by Warren Winiarski, and Stags' Leap Winery, owned by Carl Doumani (note 
the different placement of the apostrophes in the winery names), waged a costly 
legal battle, each claiming first use of the name. Eventually a settlement 
permitted both men the use of the name.  
</P>
<P>
 * Some years ago the small Napa Valley-based Quail Ridge, claiming first use, 
prevailed on Quail Run of Washington state to change its name. The name is now 
Covey Run.  
</P>
<P>
 * Lou Preston of Dry Creek's Preston Vineyards and Winery and S. W. (Bill) 
Preston of Preston Wine Cellars started their wineries a month apart in 1976. 
Each claims first use of the Preston name and wants the other to change. The 
only result has been a lot of paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tiny Pommeraie Winery in Sonoma County had been in business a decade when 
suddenly it was sued by the giant Champagne house Pommery and Greno. The suit 
claimed consumers might confuse a tiny, two-person winery that makes only 
Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon with a French Champagne maker. Pommeraie, 
unable to defend itself in court because of excessive legal bills and knowing 
it couldn't market wine under a new name, closed its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mitch Cosentino, owner of small Napa Valley producer Cosentino Winery, is 
known for creative names on his wines, such as "The Poet" and "The Novelist." 
In 1988, he made a top-of-the-line red wine that he called Cos, after the first 
part of his last name. The Bordeaux wine property Chateau Cos d'Estournel sued, 
arguing that consumers often call their wine "Cos" for short. Cosentino 
eventually was forced to change the name of the wine to M. Cos.  
</P>
<P>
 * The owners of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, the first growth chateau of 
Bordeaux, demanded that Barefoot Cellars of Sonoma County refrain from using 
the phrase "the Chateau La Feet of wine" on its label. Mike Houlihan, wondering 
how consumers could confuse an $80 Bordeaux with his $5 table wine, avoided 
litigation by agreeing to change the phrase to "The Chateau La Foot. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fetzer Vineyards of Mendocino County, like many other wineries, used the 
phrase "barrel select" on some of its upscale products. Unlike the others, 
Fetzer sought and obtained a U. S. trademark on the phrase. Then some genius in 
the firm that owns Fetzer -- Brown Foreman of Louisville -- sent out letters to 
other wineries that use the term, threatening legal action if they didn't cease 
and desist (the way lawyers like to talk). One winery owner bristled and said 
she'd change the phrase to "barrels elect" and dared Fetzer to sue. But it 
never came to that. After a few months, cooler heads prevailed and Fetzer 
backed off its demands. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Fred Fisher of Sonoma County's Fisher Vineyards decided to call his 
best wine "Coach Insignia," he raised the eyebrows of Joseph Phelps, whose 
winery's famed "Insignia" wine was the first great California proprietary red 
wine. Phelps, fearing a problem, called Fisher. The two men met and Phelps 
learned that Fisher intended to release only super-premium wine under the Coach 
Insignia name. No legal action ever was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, some wines were just made to go with appellate torts. Wine of the 
Week 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Christophe Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc ($6.50) -- Complex herbal notes, 
melon-y fruit and a light but well-defined taste that doesn't rely on oak for 
its flavor. Along with the great 1993 Canyon Road Sauvignon Blanc, this 
excellent wine is one of the best value Sauvignon Blancs on the market. You'll 
probably find it priced lower than $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christophe brand is owned by Grands Vins Jean Claude Boisset, the largest 
negociant in Burgundy. Project director Ginny Mills of Sonoma County recently 
switched over to Napa Valley wine for its varietal line. The wine was purchased 
from other top producers and blended to accent fruit. The price reflects the 
fact that the program has no winery, no tasting room, and doesn't advertise. 
"Christophe's entire public relations program is in each bottle," said Mills.

ICE CREME  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Creme fraiche-vanilla ice cream with rum-flavored figs is an impressive 
recipe. There are no shortcuts to it. You can't cheat by substituting 
ready-made ingredients. It has to be homemade. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts with a tangy, rich ice cream made with plenty of cream, rum and 
vanilla. Then it's matched with figs that are poached in more rum and a little 
lemon juice to cut the sweetness. Make sure the figs are hot and the ice cream 
is cold. CREME FRAICHE-VANILLA ICE CREAM WITH RUM-FLAVORED FIGS 1 cup whipping 
cream 1/2 cup sour cream 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup sugar 2 tablespoons light rum 1 
egg 1 vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
Rum-Flavored Figs 
</P>
<P>
 Day before making ice cream, prepare creme fraiche by stirring together 
whipping cream and sour cream in glass bowl. Cover lightly with plastic wrap. 
Set aside at room temperature, stirring occasionally, 24 hours or until thick 
and slightly but uniformly tart. (Next day, use mixture immediately for ice 
cream or chill in refrigerator several hours.) 
</P>
<P>
 To make ice cream, combine milk, sugar and rum in medium, heavy-bottomed pan. 
Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, until sugar has dissolved and mixture 
is hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly beat egg in bowl. Pour about 1/2 cup hot mixture into egg and stir 
well. Pour egg mixture back into pan and cook over low heat, stirring 
constantly, until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. 
Scrape seeds from vanilla bean with sharp paring knife into milk mixture. Add 
vanilla. Whisk in creme fraiche. Cover and chill mixture 2 to 3 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove ice cream mixture from refrigerator and process in ice cream machine 
according to manufacturer's directions. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, divide Rum-Flavored Figs and cooking liquid between 2 bowls. Top 
with all or part of ice cream. Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Rum-Flavored Figs 1/2 cup water 2 tablespoons sugar 2 tablespoons dark rum 2 
to 3 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 6 to 8 dried figs, stemmed 
</P>
<P>
 Combine water, sugar, rum and 2 teaspoons lemon juice in small pan. Simmer 5 
minutes. Add figs and simmer, covered, 30 minutes. Taste liquid and add 
remaining lemon juice, if desired. (Figs can be prepared in advance, but should 
be hot when served.) Makes about 1 1/4 cups.

IN THE KITCHEN; LET FAJITAS BE FAJITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Modern chefs play fast and loose with labels, and in most cases that's just 
fine with me. If someone wants to serve tuna carpaccio, as long as it tastes 
good, far be it from me to point out that carpaccio is made only with beef. The 
same thing is true for mint pesto. Everyone knows pesto is made from basil. So 
you've got this green smeary stuff that tastes like mint and you think people 
will try it only if you call it pesto? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But they never should have messed with fajitas. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, everyone knows fajitas -- or thinks they do. It's that tangled mess of 
meat and vegetables that comes to you on that really neat sizzling, smoking 
plate. You wrap it up in tortillas and eat it. As such, it is kind of a 
four-way parlay of a dish, involving two cuisines. The tortillas are definitely 
Mexican, but the cooking (basically, a marinated-stir fry) is Chinese, 
including the hot plate (from sizzling rice soup) and the method of eating 
(more like moo-shu pork than anything else). 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that almost anything can qualify for fajitas: pork, sirloin, shrimp, 
fish, chicken, even tofu. . . . And they show up in the weirdest places. You 
can find fajitas on menus from Boston to Bakersfield. I once walked into an 
upscale grocery store and found that fully a third of the meat department was 
taken up with various kinds of fajitas for marinating in trays. That's going a 
bit too far. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened here is perhaps the food world's greatest example of selling 
the sizzle. The thing people love most about fajitas is the way they come out 
popping and hissing on the black iron tray. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it may be good marketing, but it's lousy food (its raging success, of 
course, only points out which side the food industry's bread is buttered on). 
</P>
<P>
 I happen to have a long and affectionate relationship with fajitas that dates 
back a couple of decades to summers spent in south Texas. Come a weekend 
evening, odds were you could find a party where someone was grilling fajitas, 
or roasting cabrito , and serving it with lots of good local beer and -- if you 
were really lucky -- some pretty good music. 
</P>
<P>
 Real fajitas are a cowboy dish from the area around the King ranch (for those 
of you who aren't from around there, the King ranch actually takes up a sizable 
chunk of south Texas -- 825,000 acres, in fact -- stretching from near Houston 
almost to the Mexican border). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fajitas are made from ragged triangles of skirt steak that are marinated in 
lime juice and jalapeno chiles, grilled all in a piece and then sliced thinly 
and served on a warm corn (or sometimes flour) tortilla with appropriate 
salsas. According to Rick and Deann Bayless' "Authentic Mexican," there is a 
corresponding Mexican dish from Sonora called arrachera al carbon . This is not 
surprising, since in this part of Texas, most of the cowboys are Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 Skirt steak used to be ridiculously cheap. The diaphragm muscle of the cow, it 
is thin and extremely sinewy. In fact, it is downright chewy (something these 
ersatz fajitas almost never are). But at the same time, the skirt steak (like 
other hard-working cuts) is extremely flavorful. And that's why it's no longer 
so inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
 So what you've got here is a fragrant, tender tortilla wrapped around thin, 
chewy strings of tangy, beefy meat. Slather on a little guacamole, and maybe 
some pico de gallo and, man, that is something that is too good to mess with. 
REAL FAJITAS 1 pound skirt steak, whole Salt 1 jalapeno chile, seeded and 
minced Juice 1 lime 12 corn tortillas, warmed Pico de Gallo Salsa Guacamole 
</P>
<P>
 Lay skirt steaks on work table and check closely, removing any "silverskin." 
Salt lightly on both sides. Put in sealable plastic food bag with jalapeno and 
lime juice and refrigerate 1 hour to overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove from bag and pat dry with paper towels. Grill over hot charcoal, about 
4 to 5 minutes. Turn and grill another 3 to 4 minutes on second side. Remove to 
cutting board and cut in thin strips. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide meat among warmed tortillas and garnish with 1 tablespoon Pico de Gallo 
Salsa and/or 1 tablespoon Guacamole. Makes 12 tacos. 
</P>
<P>
 Each taco contains about: 126 calories; 163 mg sodium; trace cholesterol; 6 
grams fat; 17 grams carbohydrates; 3 grams protein; 1.77 grams fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Pico de Gallo Salsa 1/2 white or red onion, minced 2 Roma tomatoes, seeded and 
chopped 1 clove garlic, minced 1 serrano chile, minced 1 tablespoon minced 
cilantro Juice 1/2 lime 
</P>
<P>
 Combine onion, tomatoes, garlic, chile, cilantro and lime juice in small bowl 
and mix well. Makes 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Guacamole 2 ripe avocados, halved, seeded and scooped from skin 1/2 teaspoon 
garlic salt Juice 1/2 lime 
</P>
<P>
 In small work bowl, mash avocados with fork, leaving small chunks. Sprinkle 
with garlic salt and lime and stir. Makes 1 1/2 cups.

A MODERN STONE-AGE VEGETABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE LAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposed cartoon for our times: A fire burns in a circle of stones. A hefty, 
bearskin-clad caveman crouches over it, carefully roasting his dinner -- not a 
leg of deer, not a chunk of dinosaur, but a humongous carrot. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, no chic restaurant worth its olive oil would dream of being 
without grilled vegetables, and back-yard chefs across the nation have been 
following suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The only wonder is that it took us so long. As shish-kebab lovers have always 
known, the browning reactions and smoke flavoring that make grilled meat so 
appealing have much the same effect on the vegetable kingdom, where they not 
only heighten the flavor of fresh things but also hide a multitude of 
out-of-season sins. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet fresh asparagus, for example, gets new depth from grilling, while 
elderly spears that have lost their savor borrow tastiness from the smoke. Deep 
grain-flavored corn in season is enhanced by the technique, which gives it an 
almost meaty taste. The over-sweet shippers' corn in markets now is saved by 
fire, which tenderizes those tough kernals and turns the excess of sugar into a 
whole complex of caramelized appeal. TIPS FOR GRILLING VEGETABLES 
</P>
<P>
 The two key words are careful and covered. Vegetables lack the fat that keeps 
meat moist; and the high heat that browns things so well can easily burn foods 
that are high in sugar, such as onions and beets. It's a balancing act: too 
slow and the stuff dries up, too fast and it burns. A good general rule of 
thumb is five minutes to eight minutes total per inch of thickness, in a 
covered grill. Coals should be at medium heat -- test with an onion slice, 
which should start to brown in about a minute and a half. Turn vegetables with 
tongs or a spatula to avoid juice-loss. TO OIL OR NOT TO OIL 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil, with or without herbs and garlic, is almost always called for in 
grilled vegetable recipes. It does add flavor and prevents sticking, but it can 
flare up and give charred tastes. And many grilled vegetables -- onions and 
eggplant come at once to mind -- taste just as good without the added fat. 
Better to add it after grilling, except where absolutely necessary to prevent 
sticking. VEGETABLES TO PRE-COOK 
</P>
<P>
 The variable heat of most back-yard grills forbids long cooking. For best 
results, steam, microwave or oven-roast the following before finishing on the 
grill: Carrots, beets (leave the skin on, grill whole and then peel), potatoes 
(either prepare as beets or grill oiled slices), artichokes (peel off all 
coarse outer leaves, halve or quarter, remove choke and trim thorns). 
VEGETABLES TO COOK DIRECTLY 
</P>
<P>
 Asparagus -- Use thick spears; the thin ones tend to dry out and get tough.  
</P>
<P>
 Cabbage -- Remove tough outer leaves, cut into 1 1/2-inch wedges, grill with 
the core in so they don't fall apart and remove after they're cooked.  
</P>
<P>
 Corn -- Remove tough outer husks. Peel back inner ones, remove silk and 
replace husks. Soak in cold water for 10 to 15 minutes before cooking. (Don't 
water-log or the corn will steam instead of grill.)  
</P>
<P>
 Eggplant -- Leave peel on, cut crosswise into inch slabs. Taste peel before 
serving and remove, if bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Greens -- Heading greens such as endive, radicchio and lettuce hearts all work 
well. Oil lightly to prevent desication of outer leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Onions -- Peel and cut into 1/2-inch slabs. 
</P>
<P>
 Peppers -- Leave standard waxed ones whole, char skins, then peel and seed. 
Wax-free peppers can be halved and seeded before grilling and enjoyed with the 
skins on. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer squash and zucchini -- Cut large ones into inch-thick circles or halve 
lengthwise. Leave small ones whole and keep turning to ensure even cooking.  
</P>
<P>
 Tomatoes -- They tend to fall apart, but whole ones roasted over low heat 
until browned and semi-collapsed are delicious ground into sauce. 
</P>

 This salad is rich with assertive flavors, smokey and sweet, hot, sharp and 
citrusy all at once. And it's filling enough to be a main dish, especially on a 
hot day. Yet it's very low in fat, thanks to the buttermilk dressing. (Yes, I 
know there's avocado, but only a little. . . .)  
</P>
<P>
 GRILLED CORN AND JICAMA SALAD WITH BUTTERMILK DRESSING 1 large tangerine, 
preferably Minneola 1/2 cup buttermilk 1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more taste 
1 tablespoon peanut oil 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1/2 teaspoon salt, or 
more to taste Dash ground clove 6 ears corn 1 large sweet onion, such as 
Vidalia or Maui, cut into 1/2-inch slices 1 medium jicama, about 3/4 pound 2 
jalapeno chiles, cut into small dice 1/2 cup coarsely chopped cilantro, plus 
extra leaves for garnishing 3 cups shredded iceberg or other crisp head lettuce 
1 avocado, cut into thin lengthwise slices 
</P>
<P>
 Cut off top 1/3 of tangerine. Squeeze out top 1/3 of juice. There should be 
about 2 tablespoons. Set remaining tangerine aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In small, nonreactive bowl, whisk tangerine juice with buttermilk, lemon 
juice, peanut oil, Worcestershire, salt and clove. Set dressing aside.  
</P>
<P>
 Grill corn and onion slices. Cut kernels from cobs. There should be about 4 
cups. Place into large, nonreactive bowl. Cut onion into thin slivers and add 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Slice jicama 1/4-inch thick, then peel slices. Cut into 1/4-inch-wide 
matchsticks, then slice across to make 1/4-inch dice. Add jicama, jalapenos and 
chopped cilantro to corn mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Recombine dressing. Add to vegetables and stir well. Taste and adjust salt and 
lemon. Peel and section reserved tangerine. 
</P>
<P>
 Divide shredded lettuce among serving plates and top with corn salad. Garnish 
with avocado slices, tangerine sections and cilantro leaves. Makes 4 main dish 
servings, or 6 side dish servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: SHIFTING INTO NEUTRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Located a short walk south of Old Town, a few blocks from the craftsman 
mansions of old-line Pasadena, Saladang -- a fairly tasteful essay in exposed 
ducts and concrete slabs, black stone and Thai cloth -- may be the prettiest 
Thai restaurant in the Southland. A meal at Saladang costs about twice what it 
does at the Hollywood Thai joints, but those places don't have theatrical 
lighting, Crate 'n' Barrel-ish place settings or pretty potted plants on each 
table. The elaborately printed menus alone probably cost more than the 
furniture at certain noodle shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Saladang's food is more or less the usual Los Angeles Thai stuff, but 
lightened, stripped of chile heat and odd musky pungencies, prettily arranged 
on fashionable plates to resemble a layout from Bon Appetit. I may prefer 
restaurants where Thais cook for other Thais, but Saladang's cooking is less 
dumbed-down than the stuff in suburban shopping centers, more like a new, 
thought-out California take on the cuisine. If caterers prepared Thai food for 
San Marino garden luncheons, it would probably look and taste something like 
this.  
</P>
<P>
 The kind of salads you'd expect to get at a Thai-Thai restaurant, shredded 
green papaya tossed with tiny dried shrimp, perhaps, or the citrusy ground-pork 
salad naem sod , tend to be less interesting here than vaguely Thai-inflected 
smoked-salmon salad, or a sweetish variation on the spinach salad of 10,000 
quiche lunches, garnished with slivers of Chinese roast duck instead of bacon 
bits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the usual Thai beer and Thai iced tea, Saladang also serves 
something called honey/lime essence, which sounds great until you realize it 
tastes a little like flat 7-Up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gold purses" involve little pouches of won-ton skin wrapped around spiced 
potatoes, tied shut with a strand of chive, then deep-fried into a light 
crispness. Rice-paper-wrapped salad rolls, little burritos of lettuce, pungent 
herbs and crunchy julienne root vegetables, resemble Vietnamese goi cuon . 
Fried shrimp comes out looking a little like a Japanese tempura plate as 
interpreted by an Alabama hushpuppy master -- big shrimp and chunked vegetables 
fried in a seasoned coating that comes to the table shatteringly crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed as "Hot Stuff" on the menu, the curries -- green curry with eggplant, 
red curry with sliced bamboo shoots, prik king with green beans -- are pretty 
mild stuff, served in attractive clay pots, prepared with fresh ingredients, 
but thin somehow, too dilute, without the smack of coconut and coriander or the 
density the best Thai curries seem to have. Stir-fries, such as eggplant with 
black bean sauce and basil, or shrimp with pepper and garlic, tend to be on the 
greasy side. 
</P>
<P>
 Spicy crab-fried rice is delicious, bright with the fragrance of fresh chiles, 
spiked with crunchy vegetables, generous with crab, the sort of thing you might 
consider eating for lunch a couple of days a week if it didn't cost a whopping 
$12.95. And the Thai barbecue -- grilled pork chops coated with a 
turmeric-yellow curry paste; crisp barbecued chicken -- is swell. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, you will probably try the chunks of batter-fried banana that are 
doused with flaming liquor and left to burn until they resemble marshmallows 
left too long on the fire, but for some reason, Saladang serves an absolutely 
authentic black sweet-rice pudding, garnished with cubes of cooked taro and 
slathered with a shockingly salted cream. I order the black rice pudding every 
time. Saladang

CHINESE NOODLES: THROWN, FRIED, EATEN WITH RELISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA SIMONDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I will never forget the flavor of Mr. Chang's red-cooked beef noodles. There 
were hundreds of food stalls in Taipei that specialized in noodles, but none 
was more famous than Mr. Chang's, a tiny place not far from the university 
where I attended classes in Mandarin Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang always stood at the back counter, where a huge caldron of beef slowly 
cooked in a fragrant braising liquid, filling the small shop with the pungent 
odor of cinnamon, star anise and soy sauce. Next to the beef pot sat another 
large pot filled with boiling water for cooking the noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 As each order came in, Chang would deftly grab a handful of fresh noodles and 
drop them into the boiling water, where they cooked in minutes. Using a bamboo 
colander, he would quickly strain them into a deep, earthenware bowl and ladle 
a generous portion of the red-cooked beef with its fragrant sauce on top. The 
final touch was a handful of leafy vegetables that cooked instantly in the hot 
broth. And for the mere price of 75 cents, it was a delicious and filling meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Noodles, as I was to learn during my three-year sojourn in Asia, are an 
extraordinarily versatile food and they are not just enjoyed in soups. They are 
equally relished pan-fried, soft-fried and deep-fried. They are served as a 
snack, side dish or as a filling meal by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In northern China, where wheat rather than rice is the main grain, 
flour-and-water noodles are a daily staple. In the south, noodles made of 
flour, egg and water are served primarily as dim sum with other foods, but they 
also appear on tables as a meal in themselves. In all parts of China, they are 
eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner and snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, in northern China noodles were hand-thrown, and this art is 
still practiced in some restaurants in China, Hong Kong and the United States. 
For hand-thrown noodles, a relaxed flour-and-water dough is repeatedly 
stretched and wrapped in a braid-like shape until the dough magically divides 
into thousands of fine strands. Hand-thrown noodles are wonderfully delicate 
and have a silky texture. They may be round, flat or hollow, like macaroni. 
</P>
<P>
 Flour, egg and water noodles, which are more popular in southern and eastern 
China, generally are made by machine, and the variety of shapes and sizes is 
endless. But other ingredients are used to make Chinese noodles too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are noodles made of rice powder or flour -- known as mifen , rice 
vermicelli and rice sticks -- which can be thin or thick. Very thin rice sticks 
are stir-fried or used as garnishes, in soups or deep-fried to golden nests for 
stir-fried dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean threads or cellophane noodles -- fen si -- are made from the starch of 
mung or green beans. The translucent noodles are very high in protein. Once 
cooked, they turn transparent and acquire a smooth, gelatinous texture. Bean 
threads can be stir-fried, braised or served as beds for salads and cold 
platters. Like rice noodles, they may also be deep-fried and used as a crisp 
nest for stir-fried dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Noodles are even made of tofu. Bean curd noodles may be cooked and tossed in a 
dressing with other shredded vegetables for a light salad. Many Asian markets 
in this country carry fresh tofu noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In many dishes, when the Chinese varieties are unavailable, Italian noodles 
such as spaghettini, vermicelli, fettuccine and linguine may be substituted. 
</P>
<P>
 Noodles are also popular in China for their nutritional appeal, in addition to 
being an inexpensive, high-carbohydrate fuel food. What's more, they symbolize 
longevity, and Chinese custom dictates that they be made long so that diners 
may attain longevity and their hair will turn as snowy-white as the noodle. 
CRISP-FRIED VEGETARIAN NOODLES 1/2 pound thin egg noodles, such as spaghettini 
or vermicelli Sesame oil 1 1/2 cups reduced sodium chicken broth 3 1/2 
tablespoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons rice wine or sake 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 2

just tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. Toss with 1 teaspoon sesame oil. 
Immediately transfer noodles to round cake pan or pie plate. Press top to level 
noodles and let cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine broth, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, 1 teaspoon sesame oil and 
cornstarch in bowl. Blend well. Heat well-seasoned wok or skillet until very 
hot. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil and heat until nearly smoking. Invert

to time to keep cake from sticking. Flip noodle cake over and brown other side. 
Transfer noodles to heat-proof serving platter and keep warm in oven at 200 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Reheat pan. Add remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil and heat until very 
hot. Add garlic and ginger root. Stir-fry about 10 seconds, until fragrant. Add 
mushrooms, leeks and carrots. Stir-fry over high heat about 1 minute. Add rice 
wine and cook 1 minute. Then add sauce mixture. Bring to boil. Add bean sprouts 
and cook, stirring continuously to prevent lumps, until sauce is thickened. 
Spoon vegetables over fried noodle cake and serve immediately. Makes 6 
servings. SPICY BEEF NOODLES 2 pounds chuck or beef stew meat, fat removed 1/2 
cup soy sauce 1 1/2 tablespoons sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce 1 teaspoon 
anise seed 1 cinnamon stick Zest 1 orange, removed in thin strips with 
vegetable peeler 6 cups water 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 3 tablespoons minced

sauce, anise seed, cinnamon stick, orange zest and water in bowl and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat casserole or heavy pan. Add vegetable oil and heat until hot. Add green 
onions, garlic, ginger root and crushed red pepper flakes. Stir-fry until 
fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add reserved soy sauce mixture and bring to boil. 
Add meat cubes and return to boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, 
skimming surface to remove any impurities and fat, until beef is very tender, 1 
1/2 to 2 hours. Remove cinnamon stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, bring 1 gallon water in large pan to boil. Add noodles and cook 
until tender, about 4 minutes. Drain. Combine chicken broth, salt and sesame 
oil in large pan and bring to boil. Add spinach and green onions. Remove from 
heat. 
</P>
<P>

GOOD COOKING: FILO: WRAP 'N' ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 June entertaining -- showers, graduations, weddings -- makes individual hors 
d'oeuvres somehow relevant. Typically, they are very labor-intensive, and they 
don't fit the informal style of sitting around the dinner table with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But little bites can go a long way when you've got a crowd on your hands. And 
you can save on plates since a decorative paper napkin is all your guests need. 
 
</P>
<P>
 For literally wrapping up your hors d'oeuvres I looked to filo dough, the 
tissue-thin sheets of pastry that are best purchased fresh at Greek markets but 
are also available frozen in supermarkets. Once you get into the rhythm of 
using filo, it pays to make several varieties of hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
 Filo-wrapped bites can be frozen in advance -- bake them at serving time and 
serve them warm.  
</P>
<P>
 Use an egg-white mixture between the filo layers instead of the usual melted 
butter. This cuts down on fat and gives you hors d'oeuvres that are crisper, 
far easier to cut (less flaking) than those brushed with butter. Add minced 
garlic, fresh ginger or herbs to the egg white to boost the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, a spinach - feta combination is folded into packets. These cylinders 
are much easier to make -- and very easy to eat.  
</P>
<P>
 SPINACH FETA ROLLS 1/2 tablespoon olive oil 1/4 cup minced red onion 1 
(10-ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed 2 small cloves garlic, minced 1/4 
teaspoon finely chopped orange zest 1/8 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 
3 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (about 3/4 cup) 1/4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground 
pepper 1 large egg white 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 sheets filo, thawed 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil over medium heat in large skillet. Saute onion until tender, 
about 2 minutes. Add spinach and half of garlic. Cook until spinach is almost 
but not quite dry, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Put in large bowl to 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 When cool, mix in orange zest, rosemary, feta, salt and pepper to taste. Can 
be made to this point several hours in advance and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 For strudel, whisk together egg white, olive oil and remaining garlic in small 
bowl. Lay 1 sheet of plastic wrap that is 4 inches longer than filo on work 
surface. Lay 1 sheet of filo on plastic wrap and cover remaining sheets with 
damp towel so they don't dry out. Brush filo sheet with egg-white mixture. 
Cover with another sheet of filo, brush with mixture and continue layering in 
this manner with other 2 sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange spinach-feta filling in 2-inch-wide row down long side of filo. Using 
plastic wrap to help you, make 1 turn of filo. Tuck under end of filo, 
straighten roll, then finish rolling up into compact roll. Cut in half. Brush 
with egg-white mixture. Can be baked immediately or frozen up to 2 months, 
wrapped airtight. Do not thaw before baking. 
</P>
<P>
 Place strudel on lightly greased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees on center 
rack until golden, about 18 to 20 minutes (slightly longer if frozen). Transfer 
to cooling rack. Use serrated knife to cut strudel at angle into 1-inch-wide 
slices. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature. Makes 16 (1-inch) appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 47 calories; 131 mg sodium; 5 mg cholesterol; 2 
grams fat; 5 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams protein; 0.18 grams fiber.

<P>
 In the style of the ever-popular Reuben, this filo appetizer uses Swiss 
cheese, sauerkraut and mustard. But instead of corned beef, there's smoked 
turkey.  
</P>
<P>
 SMOKED TURKEY REUBEN STRUDEL 1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese 1/2 medium onion, 
minced 3 tablespoons light mayonnaise 1/2 cup plus 1 1/4 teaspoons Dijon 
mustard Freshly ground pepper 1 cup packed sauerkraut, rinsed, patted dry with 
paper towels 3 ounces sliced smoked turkey, finely chopped Salt 1 large egg 
white 1 tablespoon olive oil 4 sheets filo, thawed 
</P>
<P>
 Combine cheese, onion, mayonnaise, 1 1/4 teaspoons mustard and pepper to taste 
in 1-quart bowl. Stir in sauerkraut and smoked turkey until well combined. 
Season to taste with salt. Can be made to this point several hours in advance 
and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 For strudel, whisk egg white and oil together in small bowl. Lay 1 sheet of 
plastic wrap that is 4 inches longer than filo on work surface. Lay 1 sheet of 
filo on plastic wrap and cover remaining sheets with damp towel so they don't 
dry out. Brush filo with egg-white mixture. Cover with another sheet of filo, 
brush with egg-white mixture and continue layering in this manner with other 2 
sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange Reuben filling in 2-inch-wide row down long side of filo. Using 
plastic wrap to help you, make one turn of filo. Tuck under end of filo, 
straighten roll, then finish rolling up into compact roll. Cut in half. Brush 
with egg-white mixture. Can be baked immediately or refrigerated several hours 
or frozen up to 2 months, wrapped airtight. Do not thaw before baking. Place 
unwrapped strudel on lightly greased baking sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 375 degrees on center rack until golden, about 18 to 20 minutes 
(slightly longer if frozen). Transfer to cooling rack. Use serrated knife or 
kitchen shears to cut strudel at angle into 1-inch-wide slices. Serve hot, warm 
or at room temperature, with remaining 1/2 cup Dijon mustard served separately 
for dipping. Makes about 16 (1-inch) appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each appetizer, without Dijon dipping mustard, contains about: 61 calories; 
178 mg sodium; 9 mg cholesterol; 3 grams fat; 5 grams carbohydrates; 4 grams 
protein; 0.17 grams fiber.

<P>
 Warm goat cheese tartlets with salsa are a great variation on the strudel. The 
filo is shaped in little muffin tins in advance, then baked at the last minute. 
 
</P>
<P>
 WARM GOAT CHEESE TARTLETS WITH SALSA 1 large egg white 1 tablespoon olive oil 
1 large clove garlic, minced 3 sheets filo dough, thawed 2 ounces goat cheese 
Basic Tomato Salsa 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk together egg white, olive oil and garlic in small bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay 1 sheet of plastic wrap slightly larger than filo on work surface. Lay 1 
sheet filo on plastic wrap and cover remaining sheets with damp towel so they 
don't dry out. Brush filo lightly with egg-white mixture. Cover with another 
sheet of filo, brush with egg-white mixture and continue layering in this 
manner with other 2 sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Using kitchen shears or very sharp small knife, cut 12 (3-inch) squares out of 
filo. Using plastic wrap to help you, lift up 1 square at time and put inside 
lightly greased muffin cup, tucking in to form cup with edges sticking up. 
Brush edges with egg-white mixture. Can be baked immediately or made to this 
point and frozen up to 2 months, wrapped airtight. Do not thaw before baking. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 325 degrees on center rack until golden, about 8 to 10 minutes or 
slightly longer if frozen. Let cool briefly in pan before filling. 
</P>
<P>
 Place 1 teaspoon goat cheese in each cooled cup. Bake at 325 degrees until 
goat cheese is warmed, 8 to 10 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Remove filo cups from oven. Place 1 teaspoon Basic Tomato Salsa, drained of 
excess liquid, in each warm cup. Serve immediately. Makes 12 appetizer 
tartlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Each tartlet contains about: 42 calories; 90 mg sodium; 2.17 cholesterol; 2 
grams fat; 4 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams protein; 0.08 grams fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Basic Tomato Salsa 1 medium tomato, juiced, seeded and diced 1 green onion, 
minced 1 tablespoon minced cilantro 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon balsamic 
vinegar Freshly ground pepper Dash cayenne 
</P>
<P>
 Place tomato, green onion, cilantro, salt, balsamic vinegar, pepper and 
cayenne to taste in small bowl. Mix well.

<P>
 Don't be put off by those tissue-thin layers of pastry dough. They're not as 
frustrating as you might think. Here are some tips. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fresh filo is best. But if you buy it frozen, thaw it at least eight hours 
in the refrigerator, then let it come to room temperature before using. For a 
shortcut, filo can be thawed unopened at room temperature for an hour, but some 
of the sheets may stick together slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let filo stand at room temperature about one hour to remove the chill from 
the dough. 
</P>
<P>
 * As you work with filo, always cover the sheets that you aren't using (even 
momentarily) with a damp towel or plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out 
and breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 * When you're ready to start filling or shaping filo, first place a sheet of 
plastic wrap on the work surface, slightly bigger than the filo you'll be 
using. Then place one layer of the filo on the plastic. This helps to keep the 
filo from sticking to the surface; it also helps you roll it up neatly. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's OK if there are holes or tears in the thin sheets of filo -- most 
recipes have several layers, which eventually cover any tears. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brush an egg-white mixture very lightly on filo, starting from the edges and 
working in.  
</P>
<P>
 * Once filo is rolled up, it's easier to handle if it's cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refreeze filo after you're done working with it, wrapped airtight in plastic 
wrap. ABBY MANDEL

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: BEAUTY -- AND BRAINS -- COUNT IN THIS PAGEANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pretty girl may be like a melody, but Mickey Stueck is more interested in 
intelligence and personality. Those are the qualities she, as pageant director, 
looks for in the girls and young women who compete in the Miss Moorpark/Miss 
Moorpark Teen Queen Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 Free-lance writer Leo Smith spent several weeks with Stueck and the 
contestants of the pageant to write this week's centerpiece story. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides brains and character, Smith found other qualities to admire in these 
young women: determination and versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all had to balance schoolwork with the intensive three weeks of 
preparation," he said. "And some had to throw in final exams, work and other 
extracurricular activities. Stephanie Sill was hoarse one night because she had 
spent a good portion of the day screaming at a pep rally. And one of the other 
contestants, Karen Blum, had to take off her softball cleats before going on 
stage to dance. She was always juggling the pageant responsibilities with her 
softball." 
</P>
<P>
 And their energy, at least when Smith was around, never flagged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of amazing how dedicated the contestants were throughout," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A local pageant of this kind is a puny undertaking compared to a Miss USA or 
even a Miss California contest, nonetheless it takes a huge commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the general public tends to forget what goes into the making of any 
production -- there's the time and energy, and there's also the pride," he 
said. "The contestants and the volunteers involved really wanted it to be a 
quality show." 
</P>
<P>
 So what about all the backstage intrigue -- the false eyelash tuggings, the 
hair mousse tamperings, the bodice ripping that we all assume is part of a 
beauty pageant? 
</P>
<P>
 "What struck me in particular was the bond that most of the contestants had 
with one another. It really seemed like one extended family," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a tremendous camaraderie, which is something pageant director 
Stueck emphasizes when discussing the pageant. The contestants really seemed to 
be more nervous for each other than they were for themselves. You'd see each of 
them at one time or another show a desire to win, but for the most part it 
seemed more like a show than a contest." 
</P>
<P>
 If you think you are ready for a beauty pageant but feel you can't take your 
thighs with you, fashion columnist Kathleen Williams writes about a new cream 
that seems to have flown off the shelves in local stores since it debuted in 
the spring. This cream contains an asthma medication that, proponents say, 
promises to smooth out the puckers and dimples and give you smoother, sleeker 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all you have to do is figure out how to get down the ramp in those 
stiletto heels.

will throw a two-day shindig this weekend with plenty of family oriented 
events. Port Hueneme Country Days will include pie-throwing and pie-eating 
contests, a dunking booth, police K-9 demonstrations, square-dancing 
exhibitions and a show by the Old West Gun Fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real deal happens Sunday when Darlene O'Connell and the Dixie Flyers 
headline a free, all-day concert of country bands. This group just keeps 
getting better. And you won't get to see them in our area again until July. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, it's a great chance to hear the new, seven-piece lineup. The 
Flyers have just added another hot male vocalist -- John Styles. I caught the 
debut of this Travis Tritt look-alike at Santa Paula's Frontier Club two weeks 
ago. And when he began to sing "Neon Moon," people took notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular country-rock group Rhythm Rangers will precede O'Connell. I was in 
the audience last week when they opened for the Temptations at the California 
Strawberry Festival. The crowd loved them and shouted requests to keep them on 
stage longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet Country and Wild Heart are two country bands new on the local scene. I 
haven't caught up with them yet but the word on both is good. Besides, with 
free admission, the price is definitely right. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the profits from food and game booths will be donated to the Port 
Hueneme Police Officers Assn. 
</P>

 More than 500 people are expected to attend the annual meeting of the Ventura 
County Farm Bureau at the Ventura County Fairgrounds on June 11. But don't look 
for K-HAY radio deejay Charlye Parker to emcee the evening's entertainment 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlye won a trip to Alaska at the Fanfest drawing and she'll be gone June 6 
through 13," said Rex Laird, executive director of the 1,600-member Ventura 
County Farm Bureau. "She's heard the call of the wild and it wasn't wildlife," 
added her buddy, Laird, with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the ratio of men to women at 18 to 1, maybe I can get a date," said 
Parker, laughing. "I'll try anything once." 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of the evening with host K-HAY's Ray Taylor will include a recital 
of cowboy poetry by Waddie Mitchell of Elko, Nev., a tri-tip barbecue and 
dancing to the Rhythm Rangers band. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is when the total membership attends and elects the 13-member board of 
directors," said Laird. "We've been doing an annual meeting since the 
organization began in 1914. But when we started the current style of meeting 
last year at the fairgrounds, with featured entertainment, we more than doubled 
the attendance over previous years." 
</P>
<P>
 The banquet will take place June 11 in the Agricultural Building, Ventura 
County Fairgrounds, 10 W. Harbor Blvd., Ventura. Social hour is at 5:30 p.m.; 
business meeting and elections, 6:15 p.m.; entertainment starts at 8:15 p.m.. 
Western attire is suggested, reservations recommended. Farm Bureau members, $15 
in advance, $29 at the door; non-members, $25 per person; call 656-3552.

THEATER REVIEW; SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL OPENS WITH THE COMIC 'TWELFTH NIGHT'; 
FIRST PLAY OF THE SEASON IS HELD AT LONG-DORMANT DENNISON PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Shakespeare's funniest comedies, "Twelfth Night" opens the current 
season of the Ojai Shakespeare Festival. It's in a new location -- Dennison 
Park, above the city -- and opening earlier in the year than its predecessors. 
"Twelfth Night" is also a lovely and entertaining way to spend a weekend 
afternoon in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Washed up onshore after a shipwreck, Viola falls in love with local nobleman 
Orsino, who is busy pursuing countess Olivia. In order to be closer to him, 
Viola disguises herself as a man and finds employment as Orsino's page, calling 
herself "Cesario." Orsino assigns "Cesario" to woo Olivia on his behalf. Olivia 
has no use for Orsino, but develops a crush on the disguised Viola. That all 
takes place within the first half hour or so, with the rest of the play devoted 
to sorting the situation out and to a couple of secondary plots. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is one of Shakespeare's purest comedies. There's no magic, no tragic 
undertones, and whatever social and political satire there is holds true nearly 
four centuries after the play was written -- and will as long as people 
continue to fall, foolishly, in love. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Backer, the Ojai Shakespeare Festival's artistic director, has cast this 
production with several well-known local actors, bringing in several ringers 
from the Big City, as well. Toni Beery is one of those talented locals, here 
making her festival debut as Viola. A skilled physical comic, Beery gives Viola 
a wacky dimension in addition to her comically unrequited infatuation with 
Orsino. Tony Richards, who plays the handsome, mentally barren Orsino, is 
making his first local appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twelfth Night" is another example of Shakespeare providing strong female 
characters. Others here are the countess Olivia -- at first distant (in 
mourning for her brother), then overly impassioned for "Cesario"; and the maid 
Maria, actress Michelle Lopez here speaking with what sounds like a Puerto 
Rican accent as she plots against Olivia's steward and token bad guy Malvolio. 
Director Backer has increased the proportion of women, making pirate king 
Antonio the lusty Antonia (played by Jill Greenwood), and portraying Olivia's 
jester as a trio of clowns personified by Antoinette Pineau, Kristin Pelfrey 
and Frankie Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 (Shannon Warwick, who plays Olivia, and her real-life husband, Benjamin Hess, 
who plays Viola's long-lost twin brother, Sebastian, did not perform during 
last Sunday's performance; understudies Jaye Hersh and Duryan Wright proved 
more than capable). Henry Lide and James Leslie play fatuous noblemen Sir Toby 
Belch (with an accent resembling Jim Nabors' as Gomer Pyle) and Sir Andrew 
Auguecheek, comic relief in a show that would be plenty funny without the 
characters, but is even more so with them. Vincent Wares is very good as the 
vain, ambitious Malvolio. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Shakespeare's own dialogue and plotting, there are numerous 
original comic moments, among them a brief sword fight between "Cesario" and 
Auguecheek and several moments spotlighting the three jesters. There's 
considerable music, ably provided by members of the Festival's Measure for 
Measure Madrigal Singers under musical director Jaye Hersh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennison Park, long dormant, has been revived by the Ventura County Lions 
Club, which has provided the location to the Shakespeare Festival. While the 
facility has been improved considerably, it's still rather rustic, so be 
forewarned. The festival will return to Libbey Park for its Summer production, 
"Othello," in August. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Twelfth Night" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Dennison Park, Ojai-Santa Paula Road (California 150), Upper Ojai 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. through June 19 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $8 general admission; $7 seniors; $3 students 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: From Ventura: take California 150 through downtown Ojai past Soule Park 
and continue about 5 miles up the hill; parking and the amphitheater will be on 
your left. From Santa Paula: take California 150 past Happy Valley School; 
parking and the amphitheater will be on your right. Seating is on the dirt or 
hay bales; cushions or other protection is recommended, as is some protection 
from the sun. Early arrival is encouraged to guarantee parking. There are 
minimal sanitary facilities on site. For reservations or further information, 
call 646-WILL

WORDS & IMAGES: BOOKSTORE CO-OWNER WINS LITERARY HONOR; VENTURA'S EDWARD ELROD 
RECEIVES THE AMERICAN BOOKSELLER ASSN.'S INTERNATIONAL SCHOLARSHIP AWARD FOR 
HIS ESSAYS.

 Edward Elrod, co-owner of the Ventura Bookstore, is the 1994 national winner 
of the American Bookseller Assn.'s prestigious Charley Haslam International 
Scholarship. It was presented to him on Memorial Day at a Book and Author 
Breakfast that also featured talks by Bishop Desmond Tutu, Pulitzer 
Prize-winning author E. Annie Proulx and novelist Joyce Carol Oates. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 people attended the breakfast, one of dozens of dazzling literary 
events at the American Booksellers' annual convention held Saturday to Tuesday 
at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The much sought-after award is open to booksellers 40 years or younger and 
with at least two years of experience who submit a series of essays 
demonstrating knowledge and creativity. Elrod's entry included essays on 
staging author appearances and on censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 As the scholarship winner, Elrod attended the weeklong International Congress 
of Young Booksellers in the Netherlands to exchange ideas and information with 
book people from all over the world. A 35-year resident of Ventura County, 
Elrod has a bachelor's degree in chemistry and a minor in German literature 
from UC San Diego. He also studied biochemistry, German and Dutch in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 30,000 booksellers and literary toilers of all stripes crowded the 
aisles of the convention center at this year's ABA event to shop at the exhibit 
booths of thousands of publishers, distributors and book-related businesses. I 
spotted Ventura folks too numerous to name wandering the vast exhibit halls and 
noted that Kathryn Cocquyt of Simi Valley and Joline Godfrey of Ojai were two 
featured authors who were autographing their works.

SOUNDS: OJAI FESTIVAL TO OFFER CENTURY-HOPPING FEATS; CONDUCTOR MICHAEL TILSON 
THOMAS RETURNS TO THE EVENT, BRINGING WITH HIM HIS ALL-EMBRACING MUSICAL 
OVERVIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "What's this?" the music lover wants to know, looking over the program for 
this year's Ojai Festival. Mahler, Brahms, Bach, Schubert coming to the 
traditionally 20th Century-minded Ojai Festival? Is it a shameless bid for a 
broader audience, or a serious typo problem? 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's just the year Michael Tilson Thomas comes to town, returning to the 
festival that he has steered no less than six times in the past quarter 
century. He's bringing with him the generous, all-embracing musical overview 
that holds him in good stead as head of the London Symphony Orchestra, and will 
likewise do when he takes over the San Francisco Symphony in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 There still will be plenty of 20th-Century music heard in the Libbey Bowl this 
weekend, from Takemitsu to Berio to Piazolla. Notably, Thomas will also perform 
the music of such past Ojai Festival music directors as Aaron Copland, Igor 
Stravinsky, Lukas Foss and Thomas' own teacher, Ingolf Dahl. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he hasn't officially been at Ojai since 1977, Thomas is 
well-entrenched in the festival's history, having played a critical role there 
throughout the late '60s and most of the '70s. Over the years, he has done his 
share to keep alive the beleaguered cause of living music, but not at the 
expense of the wholesale history of classical music, an attitude clearly 
reflected in his schedule for the 48th Ojai Fest. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, there will be an additional family concert outside the main 
festival schedule, by SouthBeat, the percussion ensemble from the New World 
Symphony. The concert will take place at Libbey Bowl on Saturday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the Ojai Festival is the obvious highlight of the cultural calendar 
in the area -- Ventura County's bountiful gift to the musical world, in the 
largest sense of the term. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a blow-by-blow, concert-by-concert account of what's in store: 
FRIDAY, 8:15 P.M. 
</P>
<P>
 New World Symphony Orchestra; Michael Tilson Thomas, conductor; Thomas 
Hampson, baritone. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking off the festival in a fittingly cross-historical way, the very living 
Charles Wuorinen offers his piece "Machault Mon Chou", in homage to the 14th 
-Century composer Guillame de Machaut. We're then flung into the 19th Century 
and into the lap of late romantic impulses with Mahler's "Songs of a Wayfarer," 
sung by renowned baritone Hampson, once a student at Santa Barbara's Music 
Academy of the West. Brahms' Serenade No. 2 in A, Opus 16 closes the program. 
SATURDAY, 4:30 P.M. 
</P>
<P>
 New World Symphony Orchestra; Michael Tilson Thomas conductor; Thomas Hampson, 
baritone; Margaret Lattimore, mezzo-soprano; Paula Robison, flute. 
</P>
<P>
 Another century-hopping feat is embodied in "Phorion," a piece by Lukas Foss, 
based on material from Bach's canon. Following Leonard Bernstein's late-period 
work, Arias and Barcarolles, and Leon Kirchner's Music for Flute and Orchestra, 
the concert ends with another new/old musical grafting, "Rendering," in which 
Italian modernist Luciano Berio reshapes Schubert. SATURDAY, 9 P.M. 
</P>
<P>
 New World Symphony Chamber Players; Michael Tilson Thomas and Ralph Grierson, 
pianos. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Thomas trades his baton for a grand piano for a concert under the 
heading "O Pioneers!" This program focuses on music of the United States -- the 
West Coast, even -- with music by John Cage, Lou Harrison, Henry Cowell, Colin 
McPhee and Los Angeles-based, encyclopedic musical gadfly Nicolas Slonimsky, 
who recently turned a ripe, young 100. SUNDAY, 11 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
 New World Symphony Brass Quintet; Paula Robison, flute; Timothy Hester, piano. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's chamber music program for a Sunday morning at Ojai is a typically 
mixed musical salad. It opens with Bach, closes with a piece by Thomas himself 
-- "Street Song" -- and makes stops along the way with music of Aaron Copland, 
Tori Takemitsu, Schubert and Berio's "Sequenza I for solo flute," performed by 
Paula Robison. SUNDAY, 5:30 P.M. 
</P>
<P>
 New World Symphony Orchestra; Michael Tilson Thomas, conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 A staple of 20th-Century repertoire, Edgard Varese's "Integrales" opens the 
final concert, which also includes Ingolf Dahl's "The Tower of Saint Barbara," 
relevant to both Thomas' student days at USC under Dahl and also the legacy of 
Santa Barbara. Astor Piazolla, the Argentine nuevo tango master, died a couple 
of years ago in the midst of a general public discovery of his music. His 
"Tangazo" represents another branch of American music at the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the festival with Stravinsky, in this case his Symphony in Three 
Movements, is nothing new. Stravinsky, who appeared at and championed the Ojai 
Festival during his Los Angeles residency, is something of an honorary saint of 
the Ojai Fest. His music, jubilant, tough, and forward-thinking, embodies the 
ideal Ojai spirit. Details 
</P>

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; MUSIC HELPED 'FLINTSTONES' ON WAY TO FAME; IN 
1960, HOYT CURTIN CREATED THE LIVELY THEME FOR THE STONE AGE FAMILY. THE SHOW'S 
PRODUCERS SAY IT MAY BE THE MOST FREQUENTLY BROADCAST SONG ON TV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoyt Curtin, 70, of Westlake Village has been humming a tune for 34 years. 
Everywhere he turns he hears it. "Flintstones! Meet the Flintstones. They're 
the modern Stone Age family." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a catchy little tune," Curtin said. "Just a simple thing arranged for 
jazz and singers." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtin's attachment to the cartoon theme goes deep. As music director for 
Hanna-Barbera, he wrote the tune in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did the music first with timpani, boom boom. BOOM boom boom boom. Then I 
decided to go with the jazz band and singers after the lyric was written. I 
wrote that sucker in a real panic because we were way behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtin said that during the years he worked as music director at 
Hanna-Barbera, he penned the themes for everything from "Huckleberry Hound," to 
"Yogi Bear" to "The Jetsons" and "The Smurfs." Most of his work came over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would call me and read me a lyric and say, 'Go write a tune and send it 
to us as fast as you can.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the main title (theme) and the end title (closing), Curtin said 
he had to write 22 minutes of underscoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody hears the main title, but there's also always music playing in the 
background. It might be turned way down, but there's 22 minutes of music that 
goes with each show." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally the cartoon family was going to be called "The Flagstones", and for 
the first two years the musical theme was different. Curtin said that after the 
show became popular, he was asked to write the current score which, according 
to the show's producers, has become the most frequently broadcast song on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that should boost that claim, Hanna-Barbera will attempt to break a 
Guinness Book world record by rebroadcasting "The Flintstones" premiere 
episode, titled "The Flintstone Flyer," in all 24 time zones around the world 
on June 3. The program will air on Turner Entertainment Networks. 
</P>
<P>
 That's on top of all the hype for "The Flintstones" movie, which opened over 
the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hearing that dang tune all over, I feel like the forgotten man," Curtin said. 
"I really do." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't shed a tear for Curtin, though. He still gets performance residuals. 
</P>

 This news flash. Douglas Nicklas of Ventura is alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklas was a member of the 366th Fighter Group during World War II. A PBS 
documentary about the squadron, part of the programming commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of the Normandy invasion, identifies Nicklas as having been killed 
in action. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Fighter Pilot's Story" includes a photo of Nicklas and his crew and 
announces the premature news of his death. The show has not yet been scheduled 
for broadcast on KCET, public television for much of Southern California. 
</P>

 Monday will mark the television premiere of Noble A. Powell III of Santa 
Paula. Powell will appear on the Home Shopping Network on June 6 to peddle his 
paintings of famous golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "QVC is doing an hour of golf-related stuff for a Father's Day gift segment. 
I'll be on for about an hour with some other golfers. I'll be discussing art 
and golf. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid golfer, Powell discovered that lovers of the sport like himself 
couldn't find paintings of famous holes to hang in their dens. Since he started 
combining painting and putting, he's sold upward of 1,000 limited edition 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a niche. 
</P>
<P>
 "My paintings are loosely impressionistic," Powell said. "You have to be 
careful with sports enthusiasts. You have to represent them well enough that 
the hole is recognizable, but you don't want to make them photographic. My 
paintings are definitively representation, but try to put a little of self in 
each one."

REWIND; HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO VIEW A LITTLE-SEEN SLICE OF BRITAIN

 Poignant, funny, tragic and deeply meaningful, "Where Angels Fear to Tread" is 
the type of work that warrants repeated viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 This British film, based on E.M. Forster's first novel, is so rich in 
real-life emotion that it's a shame it went practically unnoticed when it was 
released in the United States in 1992. "Where Angels Fear to Tread" was 
overshadowed by another Forster-based movie of that year, Merchant Ivory's 
acclaimed "Howards End." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Mirren's Lilia Herriton is at the crux of this resplendent period film. 
After her aristocratic husband dies, the middle-aged Englishwoman embarks on a 
vacation to Italy. This brazen show of independence irks Lilia's mother-in-law 
and sister-in-law, Harriet Herriton (Judy Davis). A woman of her position 
should be home mourning in quiet refinement, they believe. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lilia is tired of being under the thumb of her oppressive in-laws. A 
commoner, she married into the English nobility and was often corrected and 
snubbed by the haughty women in the family. When Lilia announces her engagement 
to a 21-year-old Italian man of modest means, the Herritons respond as if the 
entire British Empire is about to collapse. They quickly dispatch son Philip 
(Rupert Graves) to Italy to prevent the marriage. But it's too late: By the 
time he arrives in the picturesque rural town of Monteriano, Lilia and Geno 
(Giovanni Guidelli) have already tied the knot. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy for Lilia is that Geno proves to be as domineering as the 
Herritons. She's very much a kept woman who must also endure his infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where Angels Fear to Tread" derives much of its tension by presenting the 
cultural differences between the passionate Italians and the more studied 
English. To director Charles Sturridge's credit, the viewer is made to 
understand both the positive and negative aspects that make up these two 
disparate cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it is Caroline Abbott (Helena Bonham Carter), Lilia's English 
companion, who sums up the opposing qualities represented by the irresponsible, 
if well-intentioned, Geno and the refined but emotionally cold Herritons. In 
trying to help decide the fate of Lilia and Geno's child, she asks Philip, "Do 
you want the child to be with a father who loves him but will bring him up 
badly or (should he be brought to the Herriton household), where no one loves 
him but he'll be brought up well?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rich with the emotions, inconsistencies and nuances that make up life, "Where 
Angels Fear to Tread" soars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where Angels Fear to Tread" (1991), directed by Charles Sturridge. 112 
minutes. Rated PG. JON MATSUMOTO

EARTHWATCH: COUPLES WALK AISLE IN STEP WITH ENVIRONMENT; OUTDOOR ECO-WEDDINGS 
-- WITH RECYCLED FLOWERS, RENTED CHINA AND 'REGISTERED' SPORTING GOODS -- ARE 
BECOMING MORE POPULAR. 
</P>

<P>
 An eco-wedding? You may not be able to find it listed in the phone book under 
Wedding Services, Environmentally Correct, but according to wedding consultants 
in the field, it's a pretty easy thing to do. And many people are doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 What's involved? 
</P>
<P>
 Professionals all seem to agree that such an event would necessarily involve 
low-meat or no-meat catering. Wearing recycled clothes -- especially in cases 
where brides wear their mother's wedding dress -- was mentioned often, as were 
bridal showers and wedding gifts of a no-nonsense, down-to-earth sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, almost everybody envisioned that an environmentally correct 
wedding banquet table would be set with china and glassware -- which needs to 
washed, and probably needs to be rented -- rather than throwaway plastic, which 
is cheap but ends up in the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Shari Schultz, co-owner of New Directions Event Planning, a Simi Valley firm 
that provides consultations about weddings, asked rhetorically, "What's proper 
etiquette?" And then answered it: "It's what feels right for you," she said, 
and then got down to specifics. "Not a whole lot of red meat -- most clients 
are health-conscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz's partner, Shelley Smilen, said that almost all their clients have a 
particular kind of wedding in mind when they walk in the door. "Traditional," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to both Shultz and Smilen, the meaning of that word seems to 
have changed in the '90s. Half the people walking in the door are getting 
married for the second or third time. Many are more health-conscious than folks 
used to be, and are food-conscious in another way -- they often willingly agree 
to send leftovers to charitable groups like Care & Share. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Woods of The Classic Carrot, a vegetarian-oriented catering service 
headquartered at the Ventura restaurant of the same name, has the same 
experience with her clients. "I'm really for it," she said, adding that neither 
she nor her clients want any disposable items -- food or plastic. China, glass 
and linen rental can be "close" to disposable items in cost, she asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduce, reuse, recycle ethic is apparently alive and well in the wedding 
business, though not called such. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never like to walk away and leave anything that might bring smiles to 
someone somewhere," Smilen said, further noting that flowers from such events 
are often taken to hospitals and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The truly environmentally minded extend this environmental ethic to the matter 
of wedding gifts, according to many wedding consultants locally and nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of "registering" with a department store for china and silver, 
eco-couples register with a sporting goods or building supplies stores, 
depending on whether they are into camping or carpentry. 
</P>
<P>
 This sends a signal that they don't want over-packaged, energy wasting, 
probably breakable little appliances. Some even register with a travel agency, 
specifically one that specializes in "green" tourism such as honeymoon 
backpacking into the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 This interest in preserving natural resources and celebrating nature extends 
to the ceremony itself: many want it outdoors. Back yard, beach, riverside and 
mountaintop weddings have been with us since the '60s. The practice is alive 
and well in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weddings are our summer crop," joked Lin Ayres, co-owner of Faulkner Farms, a 
Santa Paula enterprise that produces Christmas trees and pumpkins at other 
times of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler Hot Springs is another well regarded non-church site to exchange vows. 
An amenity offered there that I hadn't heard about before in outdoor situations 
is environmentally sensitive citronella candles. No toxic mosquito sprays 
allowed, according to Larry Kaufer, spokesman for the locale. 
</P>
<P>
 For the couple wishing to wed yet farther from a traditional shrine, I've been 
told that certain local vineyards and wineries are available to host nuptials. 
Maybe the attraction is the availability of hard-to-find organic vintages. 
There has to be a legitimate environmental angle for such a suggestion, doesn't 
there? Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For advice on wedding festivities for the environmentally-minded, some 
local numbers to call are: Classic Carrot Catering 643-2711, New Directions 
Events Planning 581-2602, Faulkner Farms 525-9293. Wheeler Hot Springs, 
646-8131.

ON THE ROAD: SORTING OUT THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE USEFUL

 The men's blue V-neck sweater has so many moth holes it looks machine-gunned. 
The white fabric cover for a baby seat is streaked with ominous brown stains. 
The child's rumpled Beetlejuice baseball shirt has a hole the size of a 
softball in the armpit. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these articles lands in the rejects bin following a three-second 
inspection by Bertha Aldama, Esperanza Arguielles, Rosalinda Reyes or another 
of the day inspectors on the receiving line at Goodwill Industries here. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothing flies over their shoulders, like dirt thrown by ditchdiggers, in 
the search to find the clean, the suitable, the worthy, the dignified: the 
crisp black Lee jeans or the worn but spotless blue floral print dress or the 
like-new turquoise nylon Windbreaker that will end up on a Goodwill store rack 
for $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
 And feed the poor. Help the sick. Employ the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 But this textile mining operation, situated near the Ventura Freeway in a 
sprawling warehouse, is anything but easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of all the goodwill implied in contributions to Goodwill 
Industries is junk: Unusable. Waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody else's garbage. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trailer trucks pile in from donation centers all over Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties -- at the rate of up to six a day, or more than 500 a year. 
Together, they disgorge more than 3.5 million tons of stuff -- not just 
clothing but furniture, books, appliances, sporting goods, cleaning implements, 
anything that's already served its usefulness to its original owner. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the beauty of charity, of course. In Goodwill's case, it provides a 
second life to things for so many people, cheaply, yet in doing so generates 
money for helping causes. More than that, the organized harvesting of such 
goods creates a business that employs people and sustains itself within the 
larger economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the harvest is a window into charity's true heart: the giver. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the sorting line, that window is wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 With the care of a hunter lifting a highly poisonous snake, Monica Carreno 
lifts a ladies' leather thong sandal between her thumb and forefinger, holding 
it up at arm's length. Miles upon barefoot miles have been walked in this 
sandal; its leather is deeply sweat-stained and cracked, its insole bears the 
clear imprint of a foot in sand, its faded turquoise thong flaps hopelessly 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is someone thinking when they give us this?" Carreno asked. "I couldn't 
begin to say." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carreno, who manages the unloading and sorting operations, does speculate: 
"Everybody thinks their stuff is good. And then the cost of dumping has gone so 
high." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking around the warehouse, one wall of which is stacked with 53 
refrigerator-sized, 600-pound bales of clothing rejects, she added: 
</P>
<P>
 "And here we are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, Carreno and her crews sort. The payoff, Carreno says, is in 
knowing that after the harvest, "we have very high quality at our stores, and 
we pride ourselves in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, good clothing is often joined by working TVs, VCRs, sometimes a fancy 
computer or two. And most of the rejected donations do find their way into a 
lower chain of life -- soiled and torn clothing is sold to a recycler for up to 
$48 per bale, and broken furniture is sold to dealers who do quick fixes and 
drive to swap meets in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the half of all donations that are rejected, a good portion are just 
plain useless. The item must be thrown away -- as it should have been, 
certainly, at the phantom benefactor's house-cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this tax-deductible junk, which overflows Goodwill's orange Dumpsters, 
suggests lives richly lived: a Nordica ski boot (left foot), buckles missing; a 
gold aluminum chair, seat broken, rear legs bent; the cassette tape "Stay on 
the Cutting Edge With Anthony Robbins"; a torn, coverless copy of the novel 
"Dishonored," commencing on Page 11 with the words "that art could have no 
limits fixed by petty souls." 
</P>
<P>
 The blacktop at the base of Goodwill's loading dock is paved in its own 
strange litter, a tide of junk accumulating from this midweek haul: yellow 
stuffed dog, torn; broken pink barrette; baby's polka dot panties; red ketchup 
squeeze bottle; the lime-green foam letter H; yellow place mat; wide aluminum 
snow shovel, blade bent. Strangely, a gleaming silver, acorn-shaped candy dish 
shines through, near the truck's left rear tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the sweet, the ladies on the sorting line would agree, is cloaked in 
the bitter.

CENTERPIECE: CROWNING SUCCESS; PAGEANT STRIKES BALANCE BETWEEN LOOKS AND 
TALENT, BUT COMPETITION STILL TAKES A TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Monday, May 2, and Irene Panossian, 21, sits on a sofa in the home of 
Pageant Director Mickey Stueck, waiting for the other Miss Moorpark contestants 
to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Panossian is following the lead of her younger twin sisters who entered the 
pageant last year. She figures this will help build confidence, something she 
says she'll need when she becomes an entertainment lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants arrive in spurts for the 7:30 p.m. orientation. There's Stephanie. 
Cheyenne. Jessica. Julie. Everyone knows Julie. To those in this circle, Julie 
may as well be royalty. Actually, she is royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Owen is the reigning Miss Moorpark. She is dressed casually in black 
jeans, a white shirt, a checked vest and no crown. Becky Bryan, Miss Teen 
Moorpark, arrives a little later. She is more immediately distinguishable, 
wearing her Miss Teen sash. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the 10 contestants, four moms, one dad, two defending champions, 
Stueck, and two pageant photographers are present for this first step toward 
the May 21 Miss Moorpark/Miss Moorpark Teen Queen Pageant 1994. The pageant, 
sponsored by Women of Moorpark Enjoying Networking (W.O.M.E.N.), is open to 
contestants age 13-16 (teens) and 16-22 (misses). 
</P>
<P>
 The primary purpose of the meeting is to acquaint the contestants with the 
"Handbook of Rules and Regulations." Many of the young women are already 
familiar with the drill -- four of the five would-be Miss Teens have been here 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants can't have criminal records or have used illegal substances. They 
are not allowed to smoke in public. They cannot consume alcohol. They must 
always be on time to Miss Moorpark events and meetings, or give advance notice 
explaining an absence or lateness. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the evening gowns, Stueck says, "Feel good in it." But, "teens 
can't wear solid black or strapless." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan has been helping to organize the event, but on this night she and Owen 
are there for support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just go in with a clear mind and have a good time," Owen tells the assembled 
group. "Last year I didn't think I had a chance, but my personality came out. 
It wasn't my looks. It wasn't my dress. It was my personality. And if you don't 
walk away with the crown, it doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 "Be yourself," says Bryan. "That's what's going to get it for you. Only one of 
you will have the crown, but all of you will be winners." Change of Attitude 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Stueck's long-held opinion of pageants, it's somewhat unlikely 
that she is directing one. "I had a very negative attitude toward pageants all 
of my life," she said. "I always thought they were meat markets." 
</P>
<P>
 But her experience with a pageant in Oklahoma, where she lived before heading 
West, changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis was on the girl as a person, not just as a beauty," said Stueck. 
"Pageants aren't all bad. There's a lot of good that comes out of them, as long 
as they're tempered in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 So Stueck became the Moorpark pageant director five years ago, after her 
husband Jim volunteered her for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Stueck immediately made some changes in the pageant, so that intelligence and 
personality are the qualities emphasized over looks. She instituted a test of 
written communication skills to be included in the overall evaluation. 
Grade-point averages are also factored in. She didn't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took over I did away with the bathing suit competition immediately," 
said Stueck. "I don't think of the pageant as a 'beauty' pageant. I feel very 
strongly that we do young people, girls especially, a disservice when we have a 
standard that says looks will get you everything." Friendly Competitors 
</P>
<P>
 It's Saturday, May 7, the pageant's traditional mother/daughter luncheon at 
the home of Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason and his wife, Connie. The guests 
arrive in spring attire -- lots of floral prints. They are seated at three 
circular tables. 
</P>
<P>
 At the third table back from the front door sits Cheyenne Ritchie and her 
mother Becky, Renee Kinnan and her mother Val, and Stephanie Sill. The girls, 
all students at Moorpark High School, are good friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the pageant contestants are friends. In fact, 14-year-olds Jessica 
Devers and Laurel Heitzman, seated at another table, have been best friends 
since last year's pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're inseparable," says Heitzman. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three girls at the back table only Cheyenne, 16, is a repeat 
contestant. She says she isn't nervous. "We just get all excited trying to get 
to the finish," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie, at 17, is the oldest of the girls at the table. She will graduate 
this year and in the fall plans to enter Moorpark College's teaching program. 
She says her stage experience will come in handy in the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on stage all the time," she says. "I'm in the chorus, I'm a cheerleader, 
the ASB (student government), I hosted a fashion show." 
</P>
<P>
 Table conversation throughout lunch covers a variety of subjects -- moving 
violations, prom attire, boyfriends, Garth Brooks, more Garth Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 There is talk of the American flag. Renee, 14, will deliver a monologue on it, 
accompanied by the "Star Spangled Banner," for the talent portion of the 
pageant. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a thing for flags," says her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mickey Mouse and American flags," says Renee. Dance Rehearsal 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, May 17. "We're late. Let's do it fast. Let's press on." These words 
are spoken by Pam Rossi, owner of Dance Ten studio where the contestants are 
rehearsing the opening number for the pageant. The 1940's-style piece, 
performed to "In the Mood," is choreographed and directed by Rossi, an original 
member of television's Solid Gold Dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The pageant is less than a week off and the dancing is still shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the dance," 15-year-old Karen Blum reassures Rossi. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven contestants who show up for the rehearsal -- several are missing 
because of school exams -- prove Karen right. Steps are higher. Bounces are 
bouncier. Maybe too bouncy. "I feel the Taco Bell bouncing around," says 
Cheyenne. "Here comes the chicken burrito." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossi has been through this before. She's made guest appearance in national 
teen pageants, and was runner-up to Miss San Luis Obispo 1975. She knows what 
the judges will be looking for. At one critical point of the opening dance, 
where the contestants come together in pairs for their first pageant poses, 
Rossi makes a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't touch each other. Just do a pose -- otherwise you look like you're 
drunk or something," she says. "You've got to remember, when you're on stage 
you are representing yourself. If you don't do good on a pose, nobody is going 
to look at you." 
</P>
<P>
 Rehearsal ends with an encouraging word from Rossi and hugs from Miss 
Moorpark. Royal Ambition 
</P>
<P>
 At age 18, the reigning queen Julie Owen seems mature beyond her years. 
Throughout the pageant rehearsals she has served as a big sister. 
</P>
<P>
 As she prepares to give up her Miss Moorpark crown -- something she said she 
is "ready" to do -- Owen begins readying herself for the upcoming Miss Thousand 
Oaks pageant. Simply for the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it purely for the competition. I like the rush. I'm very much of a 
competitor, but I do it well. If I lose, it bothers me, but not to the point 
that I hate the other contestants. I'm proud of them," says Owen, who also won 
the 1991 Miss Teen and Miss Congeniality honors in Moorpark. "I like the 
spotlight. When I got out of high school I was no longer in the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
 If she wins the Thousand Oaks pageant, Owen will advance to the state level. 
But she is determined to go well beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ultimate goal is, by age 30, to be Miss Fitness USA," she says. "I 
mountain bike ride and I have a personal trainer. I told him my goal and he 
said we'll do what it takes." Passing the Scepter 
</P>
<P>
 While Owen seems, for the most part, to take her un-crowning in stride, the 
17-year-old Bryan openly shows her letdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad. I had so much fun this year," she says. "I used to look up to 
beauty queens in awe. I'd say, 'I want to be that some day.' This year I got a 
chance to speak with a lot of children. It was nice to know that I was a 
positive role model." 
</P>
<P>
 After capturing the Moorpark crown, Bryan finished first runner-up in the Twin 
Counties pageant and among the top 15 in the Miss Teen California contest. The 
state pageant differed considerably from the small-town Moorpark contest, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of girls there who had been doing pageants since they were 
(little.) You can spot them because they're the ones not being themselves," she 
said. "In (the Moorpark) one they are all natural girls. There are no fakes." 
Practice Session 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, May 19, 6:30 p.m. The contestants are rehearsing at the Moorpark 
Community Center, site of the pageant, for the first time. They remember the 
place from their younger days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't this where they used to have the dances?" asks Nicole Lawin, 18. Lawin 
is a dancer who plans to study bioengineering at UC San Diego next fall, when 
she "straightens out her priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be bigger," says Stephanie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to be smaller," says Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 The contestants run through their opening dance on stage. Or they try to. The 
stage is smaller than the dance studio so adjustments must be made. 
</P>
<P>
 After they dance awhile, Stueck gives the contestants some tips for Saturday 
afternoon's interview with the three judges, something that will count heavily 
in determining the overall winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Make eye contact. Give a firm handshake. Watch your body language -- keep your 
posture straight, don't roll your eyes, don't let your mouth hang open. 
</P>
<P>
 On the subject of eye contact Julie says, "I always pick a point above the 
judges' heads. It looks like you're looking at them but you're not. It makes 
them feel spppeeeccial." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Christine Nilay, a 20-year-old studying microbiology at UC Santa 
Barbara, she just plans to take off her glasses when interviewed. "So all I see 
is a fuzzy sea of eyes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a pizza break -- and talk of cellulite and acne -- the contestants 
run through the entire show, which includes much practicing of the 
all-important "pageant stance" -- body at a slight angle to judges, arms 
casually hanging at side, front knee bent. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the talents are unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen sings "This is Dedicated to the One I Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica, whom Stueck described as a wallflower who blossomed at last year's 
pageant, dances to "Rockin' Robin." "Last year I was nervous," says Jessica. "I 
even lied about my age during the introductions . . . but not intentionally. 
This year I'll do my best. If I don't win, I don't win." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel sings "Put on a Happy Face." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Isaac does an offbeat monologue called "My Blankey," which seems to 
mesmerize the other contestants. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee does a dramatic reading of "Our Flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheyenne gives an emotional rendering of Winona Judd's "My Strongest 
Weakness." "You made a tear form in my eyeball," says Owen. "I puddled." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawin dances to "Under Pressure," by Boyz II Men. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilay plays the piano and sings "On My Own." 
</P>
<P>
 Panossian performs a Beethoven medley on piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie sings Garth Brooks' "The River." 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's on to evening gown practice, for which sneakers and socks are 
replaced by high heels. "I really need nylons for this," says Jessica. "And I 
just tore mine off." Last-Minute Jitters 
</P>
<P>
 Parents mingle in the auditorium lobby while the contestants ready themselves 
behind closed doors. Some mothers make 11th-hour clothing drops. 
</P>
<P>
 It's May 21, pageant night, and nearly three weeks of intense preparation will 
culminate in less than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lobby the guests file in. Miss Thousand Oaks arrives, all glittery. 
Miss California USA, Toay Foster, whose mother is a judge, is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan is reminded to breathe deeply as she paces back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:40 p.m., with the audience seated, the room goes dark. And the pageant 
begins. Contestants march on stage for their opening dance. Every one of them 
is smiling, as Rossi ordered. Cameras flash here and there. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pageant proceeds, the parking lot to the side of the stage becomes the 
contestants' waiting area. The side mirrors of a car are used for last second 
make-up checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the evening there are countless crossed fingers and high-fives as 
contestants root for and congratulate one another. Before long it's talent 
time. The pageant is moving fast. Karen sits on a stool near the parking lot, 
waiting to sing. She's looking tense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone give me a hug," she says. Stueck, who is handing out words of 
encouragement and directing traffic with her husband, is the first to respond. 
But not the last. The stool quickly becomes a pile of wrapped arms. 
</P>

 Karen is the first on stage for the question-and-answer portion of the 
contest. If you had to lose one of your senses, which would you chose? She 
explains that she would choose her sense of smell, so she wouldn't have to 
smell all the terrible things. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of competition, a nervous Stueck heads for a conference room 
with Robert Duclos, a local CPA who's quick on the adding machine. The 
contestants, back in the dressing rooms, await the tabulation of the judges' 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the tense part," says Stueck. Both competitions are too close to 
call. Stueck says she's been invited to a contestant slumber party where she 
will present them all with crowns from Burger King. "I've said, even if they 
don't walk away with the crown, they are all queens." 
</P>
<P>
 When the winners have been determined, the contestants and reigning queens are 
summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to give this up," says Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steph, good luck if you win," says Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan and Owen, battling with their tears, give their farewell presentations. 
And then it's time for the big announcement. The winners are . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Miss Congeniality: Stephanie Sill. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Teen Moorpark: Jessica Devers.

 And Miss Moorpark: Stephanie Sill.

 As the onslaught of photos ensues, and a year of public appearances gets under 
way, Karen, Most Photogenic Teen, leaves the stage.

<P>
 "Oh my God," she says. "Thank God it's over." Where to Compete 
</P>

FOR THE KIDS; YOUNG MUSICIANS SHOW OFF THEIR NOTABLE TALENT; ERIC CHEUNG, 14, 
WHO SOLOS WITH THE CONEJO YOUTH SYMPHONY, IS MUCH LIKE OTHER YOUNGSTERS, EXCEPT 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PIANO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eric Cheung, 14, isn't unlike many kids his age. He reads comic books and 
hones his repertoire of magic tricks at parties for his friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he sits down at the piano, his hands work a different kind of magic. 
His music has maturity way beyond his years. 
</P>
<P>
 So says Carol Alexander, conductor of the Conejo Youth Symphony. Eric will be 
the featured soloist with the symphony when it performs Friday at Christian 
Church of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 He was tapped for the spot by winning the Young Pianist Award, an honor 
co-sponsored by the youth symphony and the Music Teachers Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
 For Eric, an eighth-grader at Redwood Intermediate School in Thousand Oaks, 
it's another in a string of honors he has netted for his playing. For 
Alexander, the concert is another chance for her 55 young musicians to show 
that they take their music seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, serious music by serious young musicians is thriving in Ventura 
County. The 45-member Ventura County Youth Symphony just ended its third 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10 years that Alexander has led the Conejo Youth Symphony, it has more 
than doubled in size and the competition to join has become intense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we auditioned 50 students and we only had openings in the winds 
and percussions for six or eight," she said. The competition is highly intense 
for some instruments, such as flute and clarinet, because so many students play 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth symphony operates under the sponsorship of the Conejo Symphony 
Orchestra of which Alexander has been a longtime member. A French horn player, 
Alexander has taught instrumental music in Thousand Oaks schools for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For the kids she conducts, music isn't a fleeting interest. "Many of them are 
very serious about it," she said. "Some have decided they want to be 
musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 They don't play easy pieces or works that have been tailored to less advanced 
students. "Four or five years ago, we decided to play the original orchestral 
scores the way the composers intended," she said. "We don't play any junk 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 For Friday's concert, Eric will perform Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, 
Allegro. In addition to music by Aaron Copland, Mendelssohn and Frescobaldi, 
the youth symphony will play John Williams' "Jurassic Park Highlights." 
</P>
<P>
 They will perform again June 12 during the Oakleaf Music Festival in Conejo 
Community Park, Thousand Oaks. That will wrap up the group's activities for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 During the school year, the musicians, who range in age from 10-year-old 
violinist Chelain Goodman to a 20-year-old, rehearse only once a week on the 
California Lutheran University campus. They usually perform in January and 
June, but in the fall they will appear in Thousand Oaks' new Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, like Eric, have private instruction. Eric's teacher, Ed Francis, said 
the kids in the symphony "do some incredible things." Unlike many young music 
students, they take direction well, he said. "It's like the pros -- let's take 
it from this bar." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Eric, Francis described him as warm and down to earth. His style is 
fast and clean. "He plays a repertoire you would hear on concert stages around 
the world," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the future? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still too young to make any big decisions," Eric said during a break at 
school. He comes from a musical family. His younger sister, aunts, uncles and 
cousins all play the piano. In fact, it was his mother, Cathy, who first taught 
him to play at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he plays because he enjoys it. "I like fast, loud music," he said. 
Practice is intense -- 1 1/2 hours on weekdays and two to three hours on the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like homework," he said. "I want to do it. If I didn't, I'd quickly 
forget everything." Details

FASHION; SOME SAY THIGH CREAM ACTUALLY MEASURES UP; NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN EXACTLY 
HOW IT WORKS, BUT THE PRODUCT HAS A HORDE OF SHOPPERS READY TO BELIEVE IN 
MIRACLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Now and then a product comes to market that changes the face of America. It 
fills a need that has haunted humanity for centuries, and advances culture in 
undreamed-of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Things like pantyhose, Super Glue and WD-40 -- milestones of social progress 
we have come to count on in our daily lives. And now, another miracle of 
chemistry -- thigh cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the anatomical areas women find wanting, thighs probably bring the most 
grief. So, last fall when word spread that a solution to dimpled flesh on those 
pesky parts was near, a wave of frenzy washed over the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People called like crazy," said Dr. Tom Barnes, medical director of The Right 
Solution of Newport Beach, one of three firms licensed to sell the 
original-formula cream. The other two are Nutri-System, which is marketing 
Smoothcontours and Herbalife, the distributor of Thermojetics. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were at least 50,000 calls to UCLA and Dr. (Bruce) Frome (who owned 
product development rights) in the first month." The original story that ran on 
the cream, he said, "was the kind of advertising you can't pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 From that time on, manufacturers struggled to meet demand. Thigh cream was 
harder to get than a date with Fabio -- and possibly more fulfilling. When 
distribution reached a new area, customers practically lined up hip by thigh to 
get it. Southern California had to wait its turn. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, displays began appearing in Ventura County. Computer banners in 
front of drugstores and beauty salons announced THIGH CREAM IS HERE. Sales 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going like hot cakes," said Diane Held at J&P Beauty Supply in Thousand 
Oaks, where the cream arrived in April. "There's one lady who's on her fifth 
tube." 
</P>
<P>
 We envisioned some severely out-of-control thighs -- but it turns out the 
customer was applying the product to a number of body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 This is OK, Barnes assured us. Thighs were used for comparison studies because 
there are two of them, one for control. But the cream's been found effective on 
"buttocks, double chins, love handles," to name a few other unruly areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this good for us? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not dangerous," said Dr. Robert Byers, an internist in private 
practice in Santa Barbara. "It's a stimulant, sort of like caffeine. . . . The 
little bit that gets into your blood really won't cause any problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the drug used in the cream is Aminophylline, a widely used asthma 
medication. Some creams may contain Theophylline, which is in the same family 
of asthma medications. 
</P>
<P>
 As to its effectiveness, Byers said, "It's something in the hocus-pocus 
cosmetic world, but not really accepted in the medical world, because it hasn't 
been scrutinized by (sufficient) studies and experiment. That's not to say it 
may not prove to be effective down the road, but it's not in that category 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Medical, schmedical as far as local folk are concerned. Thigh cream waiting 
lists formed. An Ojai pharmacist who didn't wish to be named reported one 
customer had applied the cream to a sagging neck and avoided planned cosmetic 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 At Les Romantiques, a beauty boutique in Oxnard's Esplanade Mall, owner Angela 
Rodkoff said she had run out of the cream several times in trying to meet 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 We watched a Right Solution promotion of its product Cellution at her shop. 
Independent distributor R.C. Smith was on hand to show a videotape of a 
shrinking thighs experiment conducted by "Hard Copy," using the original 
formula cream. Dr. Bruce Frome is shown measuring a chorus line of thighs, and 
announcing results. 
</P>
<P>
 As women paused to watch the tape, Smith explained the product's use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smoothes the dimpled effect out," he told Dawn Citara of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 She was skeptical. "It's actually getting rid of it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you exactly how it works. It really is designed to smooth and 
contour. . . . Is it a product you would use if it worked?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you bet," she said. "It actually reduces the thighs? If it worked, it 
would be a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it does work. They did a clinical study. If 'Hard Copy' says it works, 
you know it does. I'm sure they probably weren't happy about having to say it 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 After more conversation, Citara decided to think it over, and departed without 
the cream. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people who shop in pairs return alone after the initial contact to 
buy the product, Smith said. "They don't like other people to know they are 
buying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Enough people are buying it that sales, unlike the thighs they target, 
continue to expand. The products could herald the dawn of a new age in thigh 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who may have had years of anxiety, uncertain how to dress for the beach, 
can now relax, secure in the assurance of a level playing field, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 We met one of them, an elated Ventura professional woman who declined to give 
her name, saying she had used the cream for three weeks with satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't noticed that I am any thinner, but I've definitely noticed that the 
lumps have smoothed out in my thighs," she said, "I used to have curds; now I 
have whey."

SHOP TALK; REVVING UP FOR RUSH TO NEW FACTORY OUTLET MALL; ALTHOUGH A FEW OF 
THE OXNARD STORES OPENED OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND, THE BIG BARGAIN EVENT IS SET 
FOR JUNE 10 TO 12.

 It has taunted all of us shoppers, in its various stages, for the past 14 
months or so, as we've traveled along the Ventura Freeway between the Rose 
Avenue and Rice Avenue exits. 
</P>
<P>
 Its walls have beckoned as they've seemingly appeared out of nowhere. And now 
we're ready. We're more than ready. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to shop -- at the two dozen-plus stores that will make up the new 
Oxnard Factory Outlet. That's about 150,000 feet of space, dedicated almost 
entirely to the acts of looking and spending. And that's just Phase 1 of the 
Fru-Con Development / U. S. Outlets project. Phase 2 will add about 150,000 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the stores opened Memorial Day weekend. But most of the outlets will 
begin operation at the grand opening from June 10 to 12. This doesn't leave us 
a whole lot of time to clear out the closets. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Little, Geoffrey Beene and Francine Browner. Jockey, L. A. Gear, Linen 
Room. Corning, Kitchen Connection, Leather Loft. Even The Gap. And Bugle Boy. 
Paper Factory, Westport, the Publisher's Warehouse. Benetton, Nine West and 
Prestige Fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
 And those are just some of the shops. Real nose-to-the-grindstone shoppers 
might consider throwing a sleeping bag in the back of the car the first time 
out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipate attracting everybody in Ventura County," said Jamie Barendrick, 
senior property manager and marketing director for the outlet, "because we're 
the first outlet going up in the county." 
</P>
<P>
 But Barendrick said the outlet should attract plenty of out-of-towners as well 
-- "everybody traveling on (U. S.) 101 from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara, or 
from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles or San Diego," she said. "We anticipate it 
being a destination, where people will be coming up on the weekend to shop." In 
fact, the city will have a tourism booth set up at the outlet center so that 
visitors can find out what else the area has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Facciano, executive director of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, said he 
thoroughly expects the Oxnard Factory Outlet to entice shoppers from the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will draw from a large area," he said. "This will definitely be a boost to 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this means, of course, that we might be well-advised to go on some sort 
of exercise routine, so we'll hold our own amid the throngs. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. Based on previous openings of factory outlets, Barendrick 
said, a crowd of about 30,000 is expected to turn out for the grand opening 
festivities June 10 and 11. She said another 12,000 to 15,000 folks are 
expected June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't worry, there will be plenty of festivities to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be eight or nine radio remotes. We'll be giving away a Toyota 
truck and vacations. There will be flower stands, a petting zoo, the farmers 
market," Barendrick said. "There's going to be a whole host of food vendors 
on-site." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the shops, the Oxnard Factory Outlet will have a food court -- 
including a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, a Subway and a Dragon Express. There will 
also be a sports bar in a separate location. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine out of 10 men do not enjoy spending an afternoon shopping with their 
wives," Barendrick said. "So if they somehow get coaxed up here, we have the 
sports bar with a satellite dish, six beers on tap and two different wines on 
tap. I think that's opening immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Looks like this may be a family attraction.

TV'S FIRST FAMILY OF DYSFUNCTION JOINS COMIC BOOK CLUB; THE SIMPSONS ARE THE 
BASIS FOR FOUR TITLES. THE WRITERS AND ARTISTS WILL APPEAR IN SANTA BARBARA FOR 
A FREE SIGNING.

<P>
 Aye Carumba! The meanest kid in America -- the one with the stupid, Duff 
Beer-filled dad and the mom with the tallest hair -- has fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its debut Jan. 14, 1990, television's "The Simpsons" show has made 
America laugh like no other cartoon since Rocky and his friends in the early 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the school board didn't think it was funny, young students in 
Greenwood, S.C., recently voted to name their new seat of learnin' Springfield 
Elementary School, which is, of course, Bart Simpson's school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, it is hard to avoid products that bear The Simpsons' likeness. 
Creator Matt Groening has made so much money, he could afford to buy the 
nuclear power plant just to fire Mr. Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, it's not surprising that America's first family of dysfunction finally 
has its own comic books. The Bongo Comics Group's writers and artists, Steve 
Vance, Cindy Vance and Bill Morrison, will appear at Metro Comics in Santa 
Barbara for a free signing of their work Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since about the only thing free these days is a hard time, a free signing 
appears to be quite the deal, particularly when compared to, say, an athlete 
signing a baseball at a card show. For the prices the jocks charge, you'd 
expect Pete Rose himself to show up at your place, cook dinner, then do the 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right about athletes, I guess, but we don't have any intention of ever 
charging," said Steve Vance during a recent phone interview. "The majority of 
the people that come are fans and not speculators." 
</P>
<P>
 Having money in the family or a night job is about what it takes to afford 
comics nowadays. The 10-cent comic went the way of a penny for your thoughts, 
the nickel candy bar, the quarter movie and the 50-cent gallon of gas. Comics 
used to be a dime, then 15 cents, then 20 cents, then a quarter, then 30 cents, 
then 35, then 40, then 50, then 75, now, they're about two bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you know, a new car used to cost a thousand bucks back when a comic 
cost a dime," said Vance. "One of the biggest single reasons was that the price 
of paper went way up in the '70s; and what is a comic but paper?" 
</P>
<P>
 Since the inception of comic books in the late '30s, two giants, Marvel Comics 
and DC Comics have controlled the marketplace. But since the growth of comic 
book shops in the mid-70s, the so-called alternative companies have made some 
serious inroads, now accounting for about half of all comic book sales. Bongo 
Comics, a relatively new company, publishes four Simpsons-related titles, 
"Simpsons Comics," "Itchy & Scratchy," "Bartman" and "Radioactive Man." The 
comics are selling like Duff Beers at Moe's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Simpsons title does best, and all the rest of them sell pretty much the 
same. The one with the most rabid fans is 'Radioactive Man.' It generates the 
most fan mail. I think it's because it's a parody of the superhero comics, and 
there's a lot of in-jokes and a lot of references to old comics." 
</P>
<P>
 Comic book letter writers are notorious nit-pickers. These are the people who 
write in to complain that Lisa Simpson is wearing one less pearl in Panel 7 on 
Page 23 than she did in last month's issue. They notice everything except the 
fact that they themselves have no lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I knew why they were like that since I'm the one that has to answer 
their letters. I think it's just part of the game, part of the fun of being a 
comics collector. It's a compliment if they find something where we slipped up. 
To say comic fans are geeks is an incorrect stereotype -- it's like saying 
everyone that watches TV is a couch potato. Actually the median age of comic 
book readers is getting older. A lot of college students and working adults 
read comics." 
</P>
<P>
 This seems to be one organization where everyone likes the boss. Vance insists 
that Groening is a much better guy than Burns, and creating comics isn't half 
the sweatshop that the nuclear power plant in Springfield appears to be. Or 
else he's just angling for a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Matt's the big boss. We get together with him regularly and discuss 
story ideas; and he looks everything over. We've all worked with Matt for a 
long time, and we know his sensibilities very well. He has the final say, but 
there's never a lot of conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the show is funny, the boss is cool, the comics are a hit, but why does 
Scratchy the cat always get bumped off? Inquiring cat lovers want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I like cats, too. We have a pet cat, not a pet mouse. It's just the 
tradition of parodying all those cat and mouse cartoons of the old days. The 
underdog mouse always wins. Scratchy may win someday, but there'll have to be a 
big buildup before he does." 
</P>
<P>
 So don't hold your breath for Scratchy to make mouseburgers and avenge all the 
damage done to felines in countless Tweety, Tom and Jerry and Mighty Mouse 
cartoons. Bart will graduate from Harvard and Homer will quit drinking beer 
before that happens. Next up for the comics is the same scenario that happens 
monthly in superhero comics: the continued story. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing coming up for us is the crossover involving all four titles. We 
finally decided to break down and do one. It's going to be something that 
couldn't be done on the show. The Simpsons are going to meet Itchy and Scratchy 
and Bartman is going to meet Radioactive Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, I wonder if Bartman could get back the 73 boxes of comics that my 
ex-girlfriend sold. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CHUCK WAGON CAFE DISHES UP HEARTY, HOME-STYLE BREAKFASTS; 
FARE RANGES FROM CHUNKY COUNTRY POTATOES TO CHEWY BISCUITS AND A VARIETY OF 
ROBUST OMELETS.

<P>
 Don't let the "Smoking" sign on the door scare you off. Or the banner in the 
window urging Camarillo residents to come in and sign a referendum petition 
urging repeal of the city's "no smoking" ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy's Chuck Wagon Cafe is a small place, but it isn't -- as one might 
expect from the signs -- a dingy room full of smoke. Dorothy's is a popular 
local spot to get a large, satisfying breakfast at a good price. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of Dorothy's patrons don't smoke, but Dorothy Johnson, who has run the 
place for 11 years, feels that any private business should have the right to 
accept or reject smokers on its premises, that this is not properly an area of 
government concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Her breakfast corner seats about three dozen, with a U-shaped counter in the 
middle and one wall covered with Mickey Mouse and Elvis clocks for sale. On 
another wall is a rack where the regulars keep their coffee cups. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lunch menu, but don't let that fool you. Even at 1:30 in the 
afternoon some customers are eating from the breakfast menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing fancy about the breakfast fare. No eggs Benedict or eggs Rockefeller. 
No shrimp and brie omelets or breakfast champagne. This is all down-home. 
</P>
<P>
 The stars are dishes such as the Hungry Boy ($4.95), which gives you a choice 
of six strips of crisp bacon, or three sausage patties, or ham, with three 
eggs, a large serving of country fries and toast, biscuits or a giant pancake. 
The potatoes are a special surprise. They're in chunks, fried with onions and 
slightly crisped. But the surprise is how firm they are, not mushy as is 
frequently the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The SOS ($4.75) dish may not appeal to purists. The original version of this 
dish was chipped beef on toast in gravy sauce. Dorothy's version is the one 
known to millions of ex-GIs. It uses ground beef instead of chipped (salted) 
beef, and is very peppery. I think the lack of the chipped beef denies it a 
certain flavor, although there's plenty of hamburger in it. The toast used is 
sourdough. 
</P>
<P>
 French toast ($2.95) is rich and moist, with lots of egg, and Dorothy's 
biscuits are large, heavy and chewy. And -- best of all -- the butter is not 
those little blocks which have to be unwrapped, but comes soft and ready to 
lather onto the hot biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 On the side, the homemade salsa is made of large, fresh tomato chunks, onions, 
tomatillos, jalapenos and V-8 juice. I'm still trying to figure out where the 
slightly sweet, almost smoky flavor comes from. It must be the V-8 juice. 
Whatever it is, it's an excellent sauce -- spicy, but not too hot. 
</P>
<P>
 One might bemoan the fact that the corned beef hash ($4.95) is not homemade. 
It comes out of a can and is then cooked to a crisp. I must confess that over 
the years I've developed a certain fondness for the canned stuff. But at the 
same time, I was a bit disappointed not to have been served the kind of 
homemade concoction that you sometimes find in these small breakfast spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Omelets, which come with potatoes, pancake and biscuits or toast, are large 
and jammed with ingredients. The Denver and cheese ($5.15) burst with crisp 
onions, chunks of ham and pieces of bell pepper. The ingredients are crunchy 
and merge nicely with the softness of the eggs and cheese, but the whole thing 
can use a good dose of that salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy's is the sort of place where there's nearly always a pile of morning 
newspapers sitting on the counter. Next to the pile is also a large plate, 
piled high with Dorothy's chocolate chip cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think, perhaps, that eating chocolate chip cookies after a large plate 
of fried eggs and potatoes is over the top. But try one, these are really good 
-- chewy and with plenty of chocolate chips, and without that aftertaste of 
cooking oil. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Dorothy's Chuck Wagon Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 2344 Ventura Blvd., Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Open 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday 
and Sunday (breakfast only).

 Fans of Mario's Ristorante at Oxnard's Harbor Landing might be glad to know 
that Mario Comandatore plans to open another eating establishment June 15 at 
the Shopping at the Rose center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a case of same owner, entirely different cuisine. Comandatore's 
Ristorante offers more upscale fare, but his new Mario's Bistro will specialize 
in moderately priced, wood-fired pizza. It will also offer about a half-dozen 
pasta dishes -- a couple of which will change daily -- some fish, chicken and 
veal dishes, and lots of salads. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the new generation Italian bistro. I went to Italy to see what 
was happening," said Comandatore. "I brought back new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Comandatore has been in the Ventura County restaurant business since 1984. The 
question is, how did a native of Sicily end up in these parts? 
</P>
<P>
 "I came for the Olympic Games. I helped with Italian radio and television 
because I had a lot of friends in Los Angeles," said Comandatore. "When I was 
here I fell in love with a woman, went back to Italy, came back to America and 
got married." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comings and goings: With the opening of Mario's Bistro, there will be a local 
coming and going all packaged into one. The executive chef at the new place 
will be Neal Rosenthal, currently the restaurant manager at Wheeler Hot Springs 
Spa and Restaurant in Ojai, and formerly the managing partner and executive 
chef at Eatz in Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal says to expect the menu to be conservative and creative at the same 
time. "I think lunch will play big in this location," he said. "I like what 
Mario is doing because everyone else in the neighborhood, food-wise, is a 
chain." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Here's something to consider next time you eat out. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Restaurant Assn. is accepting nominations for 1994 CRA 
Foodservice Employee of the Year. There will be two winners selected -- one 
from the "front of the house" -- servers, bus people, counter people -- and 
another from the back -- line cooks, prep cooks, dishwashers. To be eligible, 
employees must work a minimum of 20 hours a week at a CRA-member restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominations may be submitted only by restaurant owners or managers, but that 
doesn't mean customers can't make suggestions.

 UP ON THE ROOF: Students at Banyan Elementary School drove their principal out 
of his office and onto the roof. . . . From 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday, 
George Coyle worked on top of the Thousand Oaks school to fulfill a pledge to 
his students. They met his challenge of collectively reading at home for 
200,000 minutes this year. "It was a great motivator," Coyle said. Classrooms 
of kids took turns during the day to make sure he stayed on the roof and out of 
the dreaded principal's office. "I assured them if anyone got in trouble I'd 
come down off the roof." 
</P>
<P>
 TAXING ISSUE: California voters have a national reputation as tax haters. 
After all, this was the state that launched a nationwide tax revolt with 
Proposition 13 in the late '70s. . . . But cash-strapped Port Hueneme hopes its 
voters will abandon tradition and hike their own taxes to save the city's 
Police Department (B1). Measure Z has sizable support. "It has absolutely 
brought us together," said resident Valorie Morrison. But under Proposition 13 
rules, Measure Z must win two-thirds of the vote to pass.

 TEEN QUEENS: The beauty pageant in Moorpark isn't quite what you think. 
(Ventura County Life, Page 8). The bathing suit competition is out. Writing 
tests are in. So are grade point averages. Personality gets emphasized over 
beauty. . . . "I feel very strongly," said director Mickey Stueck, "that we do 
young people, girls especially, a disservice when we have a standard that says 
looks will get you everything." 
</P>
<P>
 COURTROOM DRAMA: The child abuse trial of Charlotte Russo had some of its most 
dramatic testimony Wednesday when a Thousand Oaks neighbor recounted how she 
saw Russo kick her teen-age daughter, punch her and pummel her with a gym shoe 
(B4). The girl did not resist or defend herself. . . . "After a while, I just 
yelled for her to stop, that 'You're going to kill her! Stop!' " the neighbor 
testified. Russo admits she once bit her daughter, but denied she ever used an 
object to strike her.

 Downtrodden: No sooner did we mention inductions into the Fargo, N.D., Walk of 
Fame and the Chula Vista Walk of Fame than the city of Huntington Beach 
dedicated a Surfing Walk of Fame over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is feeling a bit trampled upon. After 
all, the chamber owns trademark rights to the phrase "walk of fame" -- and it 
takes this stuff seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber attorneys have already muscled such rivals as the Downtown Newhall 
Western Walk of Fame and the Gower Gulch Walk of Fame on Sunset Boulevard into 
removing "fame" from their titles. 
</P>
<P>
 And, now, says Executive Director Leron Gubler, the chamber's legal eagles are 
drafting a letter to send to Huntington Beach -- to be followed by one to 
Fargo. "I didn't know about the Chula Vista walk," the director admitted. "I'll 
have to look into that."  
</P>
<P>
 Gubler was a bit mystified by Huntington Beach's terminology. "Surfers don't 
walk," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Calling Surf City, calling Surf City: Huntington Beach Mayor Linda 
Moulton-Patterson isn't worried about Hollywood's legal threat. How could she 
be when she's too busy to run the city? 
</P>
<P>
 When we phoned her at City Hall, a staff member told us: 
</P>
<P>
 "She is not in the office. She is running for county supervisor and has left 
instructions that she won't be back in the office until after the primary." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's on the phone!In desperation for a quote, we contacted 
Moulton-Patterson's campaign office, which tracked her down. She phoned us back 
to say she "wasn't aware" of Hollywood's trademark. As for the Surfing Walk's 
name, she said: "We'll adapt if there's a legal problem." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the Surfing Hang of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
 (OK, you come up with something better.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why couldn't they have picked on Chula Vista or Fargo?Among the new set of 
L.A. greeting cards put out by JDB & Co., by the way, is one that shows an 
earthquake ripping up the Walk of Fame -- the Hollywood Walk of Fame -- while 
tourists scream in terror.

 Scooped by our fictional selves: We were reading "The Black Ice" by Michael 
Connelly when we came upon a passage about the L.A. County coroner's office 
being forced to store bodies in two refrigerated trucks after a disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the emergency situation," the book continued, "county 
administrators had to get the first trucks they could get their hands on. 
Painted on the side of one of them had been the words, 'Live Maine Lobsters!' 
Bosch remembered reading about it in the 'Only in L.A.' column in The Times." 
</P>
<P>
 We only wish we'd written it. Actually, "The Black Ice" is a fictional mystery 
about L.A. cop Harry Bosch and we're honored that Connelly, a former Times 
staffer, made up a good item. 
</P>
<P>
 Not like the time UCLA's Daily Bruin did a parody of our column. . . . But 
let's not get into that. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A.-Long Beach area has the second-highest percentage of unlisted phone 
numbers (64.6%) in the nation, according to a study by Survey Sampling Inc. 
Sacramento is No. 1 with 64.7%.

SCOTT HARRIS: PROTECTING SCHOOLS, OR STIFLING THEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once, change came one house at a time, and then tract by tract. Slowly, then 
suddenly, the big bad city made its way up Interstate 14 to the desert. Even 
so, the Antelope Valley still prides itself as a place for pioneers, from the 
early miners to the test pilots to the young suburbanites who've now come to 
stake their claim. 
</P>
<P>
 That flinty spirit, Bobby Loughridge says, abounded in the birth of Highland 
High, a school that began in trailers in 1988 and now boasts a handsome campus 
in west Lancaster. The teachers "thought they could make a difference," says 
Loughridge. The staff, the students and parents, he says, "sure built a good 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 He's biased. Loughridge was Highland's founding principal before retiring in 
1992. Still, Highland's reputation was such that many people were puzzled when, 
early this year, the school board, by a 3-2 vote, rejected Highland's bid to 
become a charter school. After all, the charter concept provides parents, 
teachers and staff with greater authority in campus affairs. "It's the epitome 
of local control," Loughridge says. 
</P>
<P>
 And pioneers love that, don't they? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Highland's rejection was the first skirmish in an education 
battle that has now attracted the interest of national groups of both 
conservative and liberal persuasions. Under the leadership of board President 
Billy Pricer, the Antelope Valley Union High School District is in the vanguard 
of a movement that bills itself as "back to basics" but is criticized as a 
retrograde cause of the "religious right." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is most famous for its flat-out refusal to administer the 
California Learning Assessment System, claiming that the test constitutes an 
invasion of privacy. Other districts reacted to the CLAS controversy by 
offering parents the choice of opting out of the exam. By its actions, the 
Antelope Valley board effectively denied parents the choice of opting in. The 
board also provoked a lawsuit from the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 To better understand the Antelope Valley school board, consider its rejection 
in March of a proposed "mission statement" conceived by administrators and 
teachers. To quote the headline from the Antelope Valley Press: "District 
Scraps 'Socialist Bent.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The board rejected, for example, a phrase suggesting that graduates should be 
able to succeed in "a changing global society." (The word global , you see, is 
pinko code.) Likewise, the board rejected the notion that graduates "know how 
to function in a culturally and ethnically diverse society" and "demonstrate 
higher-level thinking skills." And God forbid that the schools "provide a forum 
for discussion regarding moral and ethical questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it would be a cheap shot to conclude that the board wants its schools to 
produce simpletons who keep to their own kind and avoid moral and ethical 
questions. But still. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been accused of not wanting children to think," says Pricer. "Well, I've 
got a news flash. Children are born thinking. I just don't want the state to 
dictate how to think or what to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer, a former sheriff's deputy who now runs a youth counseling agency, is a 
member and a former pastor at Antelope Valley Springs of Life Ministries, best 
known for its creation of "The Gay Agenda," a videotape widely circulated in 
efforts to prevent legal protections of homosexuality. He is unfazed by critics 
who portray him as a soldier of the religious right who desires to impose its 
own intolerant, authoritarian ideas. "I just smile," he says, "and figure I'm 
winning the debate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. It was reassuring, however, to find that stimulating curricula still 
are allowed in the Antelope Valley. Glen Horst, an English teacher who worked 
hard in favor of Highland High's charter bid, is having his students read 
"Huckleberry Finn," for example. It's hard to read about Huck without 
encountering racial diversity and moral dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer and Horst have radically different perceptions of the community's 
attitude, both on the CLAS issue and the charter proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer says the Highland charter initiative was poorly prepared, and that 97% 
of the reaction to the board's CLAS stand has been positive. Horst, meanwhile, 
says many parents don't like how the board's stance on both issues usurped 
their opportunity to have a greater voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Loughridge takes the long view. He remembers how, as a young Antelope 
Valley teacher in the '60s, he employed widely used lessons conceived by 
Science Research Associates. The so-called SRA reading labs, not unlike CLAS, 
became a hot controversy -- "a Commie trick," critics said. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, those lessons have been co-opted by capitalists. You know those 
ads for "Hooked on Phonics"? That's where the SRA reading lab is today.

 GUMPTION AT THE JUSTICE DEPT.; BOOK HURLED AT ROSTENKOWSKI DESPITE HIS CLOUT 
IN CLINTON HEALTH CARE EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prodded by the Justice Department, a federal grand jury has thrown the book at 
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski. Guided by U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr., the panel 
handed down 17 felony counts. The charges allege the congressman padded his 
office payroll, cashed in postage stamp vouchers and took huge liberties with 
his office expenses and campaign contributions. About $500,000 in taxpayers' 
funds allegedly were misappropriated. It is also charged that the Illinois 
Democrat instructed a House employee to withhold information from authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Rostenkowski is innocent until proven guilty. A trial is expected, 
although perhaps not for a year or two. Two years ago Rep. Joseph McDade, a 
Pennsylvania Republican, was indicted on bribery charges. That case has not 
gone to trial, and, in an embarrassment to his party, McDade continues to serve 
as the ranking minority member of the important House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rostenkowski awaits his day in court, he can no longer be chairman of 
the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. House Democratic Caucus rules 
appropriately require members who are indicted to step down from leadership 
posts until they are cleared. Rostenkowski's loss of a chairmanship, even if 
only temporary, could hurt the Clinton Administration's push to pass health 
care reform. Rostenkowski was in a key position to help and had the know-how, 
clout and political chits to deliver for President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the political calculus didn't result in a lethargic prosecution. 
Holder, a Democrat appointed by Clinton last year, strengthened a case 
initiated by a Republican prosecutor, Jay B. Stephens. Stephens had vigorously 
investigated corruption at the House Post Office, and had suggested that the 
Clinton Administration forced him to resign to stall the Rostenkowski probe. 
</P>
<P>
 To the contrary, and despite the political consequences, the U.S. attorney's 
office has targeted a man who could have been a key to the Clinton agenda. This 
display of independence should restore some credibility to a Justice Department 
tarnished during the previous two administrations by repeated allegations of 
political meddling.

TINY RAYS OF LIGHT IN HAITIAN CRISIS; U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY REPORTS HOPEFUL 
DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The political crisis in Haiti has gone on so frustratingly long that it would 
be easy to overlook a couple of small but significant signs of progress there 
recently for the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the fresh leadership of William H. Gray III, head of the United Negro 
College Fund and a former member of Congress, whom President Clinton recruited 
as his special envoy to Haiti, the United States has begun to rally the kind of 
regional support that will be needed to wait out the military junta that ousted 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with officials of the Dominican Republic, for example, Gray was able 
to get their cooperation in cracking down on the cross-border smuggling that 
has allowed the Haitian junta to get around an international economic embargo. 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the island of Hispaniola, and despite a 
history of rivalry between the two nations the Dominican government had turned 
a blind eye to smuggling of oil and other goods into Haiti in violation of the 
U.N.-imposed embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 That was until Gray visited the Dominican Republic and persuaded President 
Joaquin Balaguer, whose recent reelection to office is being internally 
criticized due to election irregularities, that this might be a good time for 
him to be on good terms with Washington. As a result, Balaguer ordered hundreds 
of Dominican border guards transferred and replaced by elite troops from the 
Dominican army. The result has been at least a short-term drop in smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Gray was in Jamaica to work out the final details of an 
arrangement to better deal with the continued flow of Haitian refugees to the 
United States. Henceforth, rather than be returned directly to their homeland, 
as has been U.S. policy, Haitian refugees will be taken into the Jamaican port 
of Kingston by the U.S. Coast Guard. From there, refugees with legitimate 
claims to political asylum will be transferred to the United States or to a 
refugee center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 But while encouraging, both of these steps are only temporary fixes. They help 
relieve some of the political pressure on Clinton to "do something" about 
Haiti, and quickly. The problem is that this pressure could tempt the White 
House to invade Haiti. Ousting the thuggish clique that ousted Aristide would 
be easy work for the Marines, of course. But getting the Marines out of Haiti 
after an invasion would be much more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why simply waiting out the Haitian junta is still the preferred 
option. Haiti's military leaders must be convinced that Washington and the rest 
of the world intend to make life as difficult as possible for them until they 
step aside and allow their nation's first popularly elected president to 
return. Gray's recent achievements in the Caribbean are important because they 
will contribute to that methodical long-term strategy.

CURBSIDE JOB SOLICITATION BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The action prohibiting day laborers to solicit work at the curb in the 
unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County (May 25) doesn't on the surface seem 
to be a civil rights issue, but it is our contention that all the recent 
high-profile debates about immigrants are resulting in negative attitudes 
against Latinos, both immigrants and citizens. It also fuels the division 
between Latinos who have and those who do not have citizenship. In times of 
adverse economic conditions it is not difficult to pit one group against 
another as stress levels are at critical levels, but this is the time when we 
must have clear minds and positive leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 By continuing to target the Latino immigrants for all the problems of Los 
Angeles, we fall into a bashing frenzy which cannot lead to anything good. On 
the contrary, we must demonstrate a willingness to tolerate each other and work 
together to address our common problems. Our political leaders must take the 
high road and undertake the task of defending human brotherhood, family values, 
education and creating economic opportunity for all of the hard-working people 
of Los Angeles. We must learn to share and not be intolerant of humans trying 
to make a living.

 * I rarely agree with Supervisor Mike Antonovich on anything but I will say he 
is right in enacting a law to ban curbside job solicitation. He said this would 
discourage illegal aliens from coming here looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. census shows that immigrants, legal or illegal, coming to this state 
have startlingly lower skills and earning ability than immigrants going to the 
other 49 states. Nearly a third of all California immigrants arriving after 
1985 have less than a ninth-grade education, compared to a mere 2% of 
native-born in this state. 
</P>
<P>
 In our state, with its advanced technological system, there is certainly an 
ever-increasing premium on people having skills, education and language 
facility. Our country should emulate Canada in its immigration policy. There 
they use a point system to encourage immigration of foreigners with higher 
income and appropriate skills for an advanced industrial economy. 
</P>

<P>
 * Obviously, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke's political spin doctors have 
advised her to begin damage control (May 26). Her assertion that the county's 
ban of day-laborer solicitation is "not a civil rights issue" is exceedingly 
disingenuous.  
</P>
<P>
 Numerous civil rights organizations, including the county's own Human 
Relations Commission, have consistently opposed the ban precisely because it 
threatens civil rights and intergroup relations. Moreover, anyone who attended 
the board meeting at which the anti-day-laborer ordinance was approved could 
not have walked away with any impression but that most of the proponents of the 
measure view it as directed specifically -- and in their view, appropriately -- 
at Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Burke's claim that she was responding to concerns of "300 people in 
(the) community" (strangely, only a tiny fraction of these have ever turned out 
to support the ordinance), completely ignores the thousands of day laborers 
countywide, who are also her constituents, many of whom came to the board 
meeting to express their opposition to this hostile threat to their honest 
livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake about it; by supporting the anti-day-laborer ordinance, 
Supervisor Burke has turned her back on the cause of civil rights in Los 
Angeles County.

DRUG LEGALIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Ruling Legalizing Drugs Leaves Many Colombians in a Tizzy," 
May 20: 
</P>
<P>
 I was disappointed that this most significant development in drug policy in 
our hemisphere was relegated to Page A7 and received no editorial comment. 
After years of editorial debate on drug legalization we are now presented with 
a test case in our own back yard.Rather than ignoring this opportunity, we 
(including The Times) should be embracing this as a critical social experiment 
that we want to monitor carefully. Apparently our "outraged" State Department 
hasn't figured out what is blatantly obvious to the Colombians -- the drug war 
has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect that the legalization of drugs will someday confirm Arthur 
Schopenhauer's observation: "All truth passes through three stages. First, it 
is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as 
self-evident."

GOVERNOR CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I really was having a difficult time deciding between (Democratic 
gubernatorial candidates) Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi. After hearing the 
debates my dilemma was quickly resolved (May 25).I am voting for the candidate 
who did not evade the questions by substituting mostly irrelevant, prepared 
speeches, for answers. I am voting for the candidate who answered the questions 
directly with humanity and wisdom, unwilling to appeal to the public's 
ignorance on crime, education and immigration. The fact that he may have a poor 
chance of winning is not good cause for withholding your vote. 
</P>
<P>
 I am voting for Tom Hayden.

 * Your article "Unz Jabs at Wilson in Radio Debate" (May 28) leaves the false 
impression that the governor was on his heels during the debate. Anyone who 
listened to the discussion by the obviously antagonistic host could see that 
Gov. Pete Wilson was prepared with facts, rather than hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some may complain about his sometimes lengthy responses to questions, 
one can argue successfully that he attempts to answer each and every question 
with specificity and thoroughness. This is in stark contrast to his probable 
Democratic opponent's blame-game approach. Wilson may not be the most 
charismatic candidate, but he shows the tenacity and preparedness necessary to 
run our state.

 At the end of one of his TV spots, he looks into the camera, stern-faced, 
stiff-lipped, and with a no-nonsense demeanor, while he says, "Enough is 
enough!" Pete, ol' boy, many of us have felt that about you since early in your 
Administration.

SAFEST CITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So Money magazine rates Irvine, the home of First Pension Corp., as the safest 
city in the U.S. (May 25)! Strange.I find the callous, calculated cruelty of 
those who stole millions of dollars from people attempting to save for a decent 
retirement far more terrifying than the deadly and pathetic shootouts between 
rival gangsters here on our L.A. streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims of the First Pension debacle wouldn't be listed under the violent 
crime heading, but there will be plenty of deaths per 100,000 and even more 
lives ruined. A holdup at pen-point can be just as fatal as one at knifepoint.

REASON TO AID HAITIAN REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Permit me to offer the following regarding Jeane Kirkpatrick's Column Right, 
"There Isn't One Reason for U.S. Action in Haiti" (May 22). 
</P>
<P>
 I and others know of at least one reason. 
</P>
<P>
 When some 50,000 fighting men (and some special women) fought beginning in 
1776 to free 13 colonies from the yoke of British imperialism in this country, 
some 5,000 were black. Of these 5,000 black fighters, some 800 were foreign. In 
a major battle on an island off the coast of South Carolina during the late 
1770s, a French force that had also transported by fleet some 800 volunteers 
from a Caribbean island engaged a large British force. At a point in the bitter 
fighting, by prearrangement, the French withdrew from the field while the 800 
stood and fought off the British. 
</P>
<P>
 Among these 800 was a 14-year-old boy named Henri Christophe. Christophe, with 
the survivors of this action, returned to his native island and founded a new 
empire, naming himself Emperor Christophe I. When, some years later, this 
northern part of the island joined with the southern part to eradicate French 
control, a new nation, the second democracy in the Western Hemisphere, was 
founded. 
</P>
<P>
 This new nation was modern-day Haiti. Many, many of the oppressed Haitians 
seeking to flee their native country for the purpose of seeking asylum, and 
safety, in the United States are direct descendants of 800 men who fought 
against the British and assisted greatly in the founding of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, I and others submit that there is at least one most compelling 
reason for the United States to act somehow, meaningfully, effectively, and as 
promptly as possible, in Haiti: to respond to a desperate need of many, many 
oppressed Haitians whose forebears helped establish the United States by 
fighting most heroically and self-sacrificially for our cause at a time of our 
desperate need.

CRIME WATCH; PADDLES AND POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The synchronized knee-jerk competition among politicians to portray themselves 
as tough on crime has moved into overdrive with an Orange County assemblyman's 
bill to have juvenile graffiti vandals whacked up to 10 times with a wooden 
paddle. A parent of the miscreant would be offered the chance to wield the 
paddle; should the mother or father decline, or wield the stick too lightly, a 
court bailiff could do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 As a visceral reaction to an ugly blight, paddling is understandable. So is 
shooting a car thief. So is hanging an armed robber. But while such punishments 
might seem emotionally satisfying, as rational law they stink. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the proposal of Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) has ridden the 
airwaves since he introduced it last week, becoming a staple on talk radio 
shows and even showing up in newspapers overseas. A key reason is the extensive 
publicity given to the case of Michael Fay, the 18-year-old American who was 
struck four times with a four-foot rattan cane in Singapore last month. That 
barbarism followed Fay's guilty plea to vandalizing cars by spray-painting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti scars buildings in Paris and Frankfurt, New York and Los Angeles. But 
the scrawls are not an ever-increasing phenomenon. Some Orange County judges 
said last year they thought it was abating, in part because convicted vandals 
were being fined more and forced to spend more hours painting over their 
handiwork. Those are appropriate punishments, worth maintaining even in years 
when politicians are not up for reelection.

COLUMN LEFT/ MICHAEL KINSLEY: DOGS OF WAR ARE SNAPPING AT CLINTON; AT THE 1984 
D-DAY CEREMONIES, NO ONE QUESTIONED REAGAN'S WARTIME 'SERVICE' IN HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KINSLEY, Michael Kinsley's column appears in the New Republic, where 
he is a senior editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan spent World War II in Hollywood. "My job," he recalls artlessly 
in his autobiography, "was to narrate the 'pilot training' films . . . then 
say, 'Bombs away' at the appropriate time." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan was ostensibly barred from overseas duty because of poor eyesight. It 
is possible, I suppose, that a man who could read perfectly from a Teleprompter 
on D-day 1984 had worse eyesight four decades earlier than all the millions of 
Americans who did risk their lives in battle. But I cherish suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Reagan's own war record didn't even merit a mention in the 
Washington Post report 10 years ago on his 40th anniversary speech at Omaha 
Beach. "They knew some things are worth dying for," Reagan declared. "One's 
country is worth dying for; and democracy is worth dying for." 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet that Bill Clinton will not be so lucky when he delivers his own 
D-day speech next week. Already, the alleged difficulties arising from his 
avoidance of military service form the predominant theme in the coverage of his 
European trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast must infuriate Clinton. Why could Reagan get away with noble talk 
of men dying for a great cause without snickers of contempt, when he can't? 
There are several answers. First, there was Reagan's famous "magic," which is 
another way of saying that his performance skills could ride over little 
anomalies like his own record in the very war being commemorated. Reagan was an 
"actor"; Clinton is a "phony." The difference is a matter of style, not 
morality, but c'est la guerre.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, the press is a lot harder on Clinton than it ever was on Reagan. 
The Clintonites are right to feel that the political opposition is more 
poisonous, and more organized, than what Reagan faced. It keeps the "draft 
dodger" issue bubbling. But there's also no denying that Clinton's slippery 
avoidance of military service keeps coming up because it plays into larger, and 
legitimate, doubts that people have about his character. And those doubts, 
unfortunately, are metastasizing with every day's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got to do something to stop this. His presidency's at stake. No kidding. 
That's why I hope that Clinton uses a bit of time in his own D-day speech next 
week to take a risk and reach deeper than he has in the past on the subject of 
his generation's war and his own relationship to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's previous riffs on this theme, such as his remarks to hecklers when 
he spoke at the Vietnam Memorial on Memorial Day, 1993, have been banal 
reflections that America is a great country because we're all free to disagree. 
"Just as war is freedom's cost, disagreement is freedom's privilege," etc. 
That's evasive. 
</P>
<P>
 The key points are three. Unlike Ronald Reagan (or Dan Quayle), Bill Clinton 
avoided putting his life at risk in a cause he thought was morally wrong. 
What's more, he devoted considerable effort to foreclosing the necessity for 
others to put their lives at risk, either. Most important, the country 
ultimately decided that Bill Clinton was right. This was a war that, in the 
end, a large majority of American citizens didn't want to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't absolve Clinton completely. He pulled several fast ones to escape 
military service, and his motives almost certainly were mixed. But -- with all 
due honor to Vietnam veterans -- no American needs to feel ashamed of not 
having fought in Vietnam. And any American who participated in the nonviolent 
protests that helped to end the killing and dying in that war can be proud of 
his or her "record." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has nominated Sam Brown to be U.S. ambassador to the CSCE (an 
international organization based in Vienna; you don't care what CSCE stands for 
any more than I do). Brown's nomination has been blocked by a Republican 
filabuster in the Senate because he was the leader of one of the big -- and 
peaceful -- antiwar marches.  
</P>
<P>
 The reason the Republicans can get away with this is that the country is not 
being honest with itself about Vietnam. We decided as a nation that the game 
was not worth the candle. Now many wish to blame the antiwar movement for 
losing the war for us.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's tendency, as many have noted, is to try to please everybody. It 
would certainly not please everybody if he were to use the occasion of D-day 
for a word or two in forthright defense of his own opposition to a later war. 
But, fairly or unfairly, Clinton will not enjoy Ronald Reagan's luxury of 
gliding past D-day on a cloud of tears and pretty language. His avoidance of 
military service will be on many minds, and those minds will be pondering 
whether it was mainly a matter of principle or a matter of cowardice. Some 
rhetorical courage on the day might help to resolve doubts.

 Last year, Intel Corp. decided to locate a manufacturing facility near 
Albuquerque, N.M., after being wooed with lavish public benefits. Intel claimed 
that high California taxes drove them to New Mexico, starting a legislative 
stampede that led California to open gaping new loopholes in the corporate tax. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after the Legislature enacted a half-billion-dollar-per-year investment 
tax credit, Intel located another manufacturing facility outside California -- 
this time in Arizona. Tax considerations, said the company, had nothing to do 
with the location decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Are California's lawmakers the least bit angry with such a betrayal? Did the 
Wilson Administration express dismay that, after we gave away the store, Intel 
went to another state anyway? Not at all. In fact, Speaker Willie Brown is in 
the process of pushing yet another break, this time for CEOs and managers, 
based on the threat that Taco Bell might move its headquarters to Texas. Call 
it the "run for the border" tax break. 
</P>
<P>
 Who lost Intel? Why might Taco Bell move from Laguna Beach to Plano, Tex.? The 
facts of the issue are beside the point, because they demonstrate that 
California is highly competitive with regard to taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utah State Tax Commission does a regular study of Western states' 
business-tax burdens. California comes out lowest among these states, slightly 
below Idaho. Washington and Arizona are the highest, yet both continue to be 
held up as examples of a healthy growth environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Taco Bell need a tax break for its headquarters? The Washington, D.C., 
Board of Trade studied combined state and local business tax burdens in major 
cities across the country. The tax burden for a business-services corporation 
in San Francisco and Los Angeles is -- surprise -- at the bottom of 14 cities, 
at less than half that of Chicago, New York and Phoenix, and well below other 
Western cities including Seattle, Dallas, Houston and Denver. And, as Los 
Angeles' post-civil-disorder Revitalization Zone tax benefits kick in, the 
numbers will plummet even lower. 
</P>
<P>
 If taxes matter, California should be doing well in this interstate 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Intel told us by choosing Arizona, taxes are at best a very minor 
consideration in location decisions. A study done by Peat, Marwick showed that 
state and local taxes, combined, represent less than 2%, and often closer to 
1%, of total costs of doing business. So tax differences -- and tax breaks -- 
make a highly marginal impact on location decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these breaks give tax relief for activity that would take place 
anyway. The revenue impact of last year's investment tax credit is a perfect 
example. We know for certain that the oil industry plans $6 billion to $8 
billion in new investment over the next few years for their refineries, not 
only because they said so, but also because they are required to do so by state 
and federal law to produce reformulated gasoline. That $8 billion will generate 
several hundred-million dollars in tax breaks for multinational oil companies 
-- a major share of the expected revenue losses from the new tax break -- and 
will not generate one new job that would not otherwise be forthcoming.  
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Speaker Brown's Taco Bell bill, not one but three 
"headquarters" in California would qualify for lavish tax breaks on executive 
salaries and lease payments -- a measure so broad that virtually any major 
corporate office would receive a break. That's wherethe argument that the state 
will gain revenue, put forward by business proponents as well as the Los 
Angeles Times, is completely flawed. If California gives tax breaks to every 
regional corporate office in the state, as the bill would require, the costs 
will greatly overwhelm the ostensible benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell has apparently been offered a significant package to relocate to 
Texas. Faced with clearly predatory attempts by other states, California may 
need some tools to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 While proposals to provide targeted breaks have been offered in the 
Legislature, California's business leaders have sought instead across-the-board 
tax relief -- a scattershot approach that is least likely to have any impact. 
</P>
<P>
 If we really care about revenue, it's far better to be in a position to help 
one targeted company than to gut the entire corporate tax in the process. 
Instead, it's been a one-directional stampede to blow big loopholes in the tax 
system whenever there's a corporate threat to move.

PERSPECTIVE ON SKID ROW; MAKE 'CUSTOMERS' OF CHARITY CASES; TURN THESE 
NEIGHBORHOODS INTO RESEARCH LABORATORIES THAT INCLUDE THE HOMELESS IN 
DEVELOPING REMEDIES.

 Physical scientists are a powerful special-interest group in our society. 
Through the National Science Foundation and a host of other institutions, the 
nation deliberately promotes science and technology. There's an infrastructure 
to support their activities -- technology parks and industrial consortia to 
team up, pool resources and share results so that "breakthroughs" and 
"synergies" can result. Scientists who decry the use of vague language because 
it is "unscientific" are more than willing to use it when it serves their 
purposes. Even more, they have to use it because no one can "prove" that most 
technological innovations will pay off handsomely in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not mean that science and technology have a blank check any longer 
-- the cancellation of the Supercollider is a case in point. But there's no 
doubt that the United States has science and technology policies. 
</P>
<P>
 We in the human services sphere might then ask how we fare when it comes to 
social innovations. To our knowledge, there are no "social innovation parks" -- 
no zones of major cities deliberately set aside for the purpose of 
experimenting with social ideas on a systemic and systematic basis. We have 
industrial enterprise zones but no social innovation zones. 
</P>
<P>
 We have learned that change and innovation are tantamount to survival for 
industrial corporations such as General Motors and IBM. Why is the same not 
true of social institutions? 
</P>
<P>
 Many months ago, several members of organizations in Los Angeles that serve 
the homeless began coming together to pioneer new approaches. Participants try 
to abide by the rule that there is no one best way to serve the poor. This by 
itself helps to remove the senseless bickering that in the past has divided 
institutions. For instance, it is not important whether an organization adopts 
a secular or a religious philosophy in serving the poor and the homeless. What 
counts is the joint recognition that both approaches are needed and that they 
need to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 However, merely bringing diverse organizations together is not enough. We 
believe that a major portion of what is known as Skid Row ought to be remade as 
a "social enterprise zone." Even more, it ought to be seen as a "recovery 
center" for the entire city of Los Angeles. Such a social enterprise zone would 
focus creative talents and energies on the possibility of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no healthy parts of Los Angeles unless every part is healthy and 
we cannot continue to hide or perpetu-ate the kinds of antisocial behaviors 
that are prominent in Skid Row. (As the riots demonstrated, no part of L.A. is 
safe if the whole is not.) We are not saying that every resident of Skid Row 
can become a productive, wage-earning citizen; in fact, realism about the wide 
range of homeless people is necessary for the changes we seek. 
</P>
<P>
 If the events of the past few years in Los Angeles have demonstrated anything, 
it is that new approaches to social innovation are needed desperately. 
Organizations serving the poor will not only have to reorganize and restructure 
themselves, but foundations supporting these efforts will also have to change. 
We need to start thinking of the poor as consumers of our services, or even as 
customers. Even more, the customers need to be co-designers of the zones we are 
proposing and testers of any ensuing proposals. This is merely the social 
equivalent of test-marketing. As consumers in all industries are driving the 
design of services, so too should the consumer be involved in shaping human 
social services. If a consumer feels unconsidered, he or she will likely reject 
a product as irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 We also have to do something deeper: We have to recognize that many programs 
that are intended to serve the poor and the homeless actually reinforce the 
problem. In the language of dysfunctional families, many of our approaches must 
be viewed as co-dependent forces in maintaining poverty and homelessness. Our 
goal as producers, unlike that of widget makers, should be to reduce, not 
encourage, repeat business and increase our customers' self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 A recovering city needs to have, for instance, an Institute of Addictionology 
to study addiction in all its forms, chemical and non-chemical, not merely the 
obvious ones. Such research might serve our customers by getting them hooked on 
beneficial rather than destructive behaviors -- computers, perhaps, instead of 
drugs. The goal would be to establish an atmosphere of discovery and creative 
collaboration -- a university of urban health. The old institutions have got us 
to this point in social progress but are stalled. There has to be a place to 
ask the "what if?" questions and carry out the "why not?" experiments.

ANGELS CRUMBLE IN 10TH; BASEBALL: BUTCHER WALKS IN WINNING RUN AFTER SMITH'S 
BLUNDERS IN 3-2 LOSS TO INDIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Angel reliever Mike Butcher reared back and kicked the Gatorade cooler 
Wednesday night, knocking it to the ground. He grabbed an empty box, and tossed 
it toward the on-deck circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as if he had not inflicted enough damage, Butcher grabbed the cooler 
with two hands, and flung it all the way to the first-base coach's box. 
</P>
<P>
 While it was Butcher losing his cool after walking in the game-winning run in 
the Angels' 3-2, 10th-inning defeat to the Cleveland Indians, he actually was 
venting the frustrations of the Angel team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game the Angels could have won -- particularly with starter Phil 
Leftwich yielding only five hits and two runs in 8 2/3 innings -- should have 
won, and lost. Instead, Cleveland won its 10th consecutive home game, much to 
the delight of 32,938 fans at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get it all out of my system before I walked in here," said 
Butcher, gesturing at the new clubhouse. "I wanted to let it go out there 
before coming back in here and facing the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann summoned Butcher into his office afterward 
simply to reassure him that he liked his aggressive pitching style. He was 
assured that he'll be right back out there again in the same situation. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, he also likes a guy who exhibits his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Butcher was the one who walked former teammate Rene Gonzales with the 
bases loaded to force in the winning run, no one seemed to feel worse than left 
fielder Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith made a baserunning gaffe and a fielding blunder that ultimately cost the 
Angels the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel worse about this than anybody," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 2-2, Smith led off the ninth with a grounder to third 
baseman Jim Thome. Thome fired the ball over the head of first baseman Paul 
Sorrento down the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, however, was running at full speed down the line and didn't realize the 
ball was past him until it was too late. He made a move toward second base, 
changed his mind, and walked back to first. 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Carlos Baerga noticed the move. He threw quickly to Sorrento, 
and first-base umpire Ted Hendry called him out. Smith and Lachemann vehemently 
argued, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 The gaffe grew significantly when Jim Edmonds followed with a double into the 
left-center gap, and was left stranded. Then, after Chili Davis ended the top 
of the 10th inning by grounding into a double play with runners on first and 
third, Smith made the critical fielding mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Kirby led off the bottom of the 10th with a single to left field off 
reliever Bob Patterson. Carlos Baerga grounded out, forcing Kirby at second. 
Lachemann brought in Butcher to face right-handed hitter Albert Belle. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle, on a hit-and-run, then lined a single to left. Baerga rounded second 
but slipped and fell. It appeared to be a huge break for the Angels. But Smith 
overran the ball, enabling Baerga to reach third. Then, thinking Baerga might 
be heading home, he threw to third, letting Belle reach second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had no choice but to intentionally walk Eddie Murray and take their 
chances on Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales took the first pitch for a ball and fouled off the second pitch. He 
didn't swing again. Fastball, Ball 2. Fastball, Ball 3. Fastball, low, Ball 4.

MILLER HAS A MICHAEL JORDAN QUARTER AS PACERS GO UP, 3-2; NBA PLAYOFFS: HE 
MAKES FIVE THREE-POINTERS WHILE SCORING 25 POINTS IN FINAL PERIOD TO OVERTAKE 
KNICKS, 93-86. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 His most appropriate move was not even his toughest. It came when teammate 
Haywoode Workman was at the free-throw line and about to tie a game the New 
York Knicks had led by 16 points in the first quarter and by 14 in the third. 
Reggie Miller put his hands on his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 He was showing choke, and that was only fitting. It was Miller, after all, who 
suffocated the Knicks Wednesday night and left everyone else gasping for breath 
to describe his performance, a 39-point showing, with 25 coming in the fourth 
quarter. It carried the Indiana Pacers to a 93-86 victory and will certainly be 
remembered for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks are working on days. The loss in Game 5 of the NBA Eastern 
Conference finals, before a stunned crowd of 19,763 at Madison Square Garden, 
has New York down, three games to two, and facing elimination when the series 
moves back to Indianapolis on Friday night. That would be the same city where 
the Pacers are 6-0 in these playoffs, where they won two games over the 
Memorial Day weekend and where Miller broke out of his three-game slump Monday 
to score 31 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That was impressive. This was brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fortunate," said Coach Larry Brown, who has the Pacers on the verge 
of a trip to the NBA finals after they had never been beyond the first round 
before. "I've been with some pretty great players. (Danny Manning's) 
performance in the (NCAA) finals when I was at Kansas was pretty special. But I 
think it's hard to top this one." 
</P>
<P>
 The motion has been seconded. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a Michael Jordan-type quarter," Knick Coach Pat Riley said. "He was 
totally unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller attacked the record books and the Knicks at the same time. The five 
three-pointers in the fourth quarter were an NBA record from behind the arc in 
a period in the playoffs, breaking the mark of four held by several players. 
The 25 points were four shy of Sleepy Floyd's postseason record of 29 for a 
quarter set on May 10, 1987, while playing for the Warriors against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and Miller puts it among his better games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the significance of where it was and the playoffs," he said. "I've 
probably had better shooting performances, but on the road, in the Garden, Game 
5? It ranks right up there." 
</P>
<P>
 He was six of 11 overall on three-pointers, having made only one of six 
heading into the fourth quarter, but sent a message with his first shot, not 
just a three-pointer but one from a couple of steps behind the stripe. The next 
time downcourt, another three-pointer cut the Pacer deficit to 72-64. 
</P>
<P>
 Two possessions later, he connected from the right side, then followed with a 
wide-open baseline jumper from the left side with the shot clock at 2. That was 
as startling as Miller's run was overwhelming -- the Knicks, who got this far 
on defense, were letting one of the best shooters in the world get free on a 
regular basis. They would have been safer walking through Central Park at 
midnight, asking people to make change for a $1,000 bill. And here's the key to 
the Mercedes -- can you park that, too? 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said he didn't think any guard had ever gotten that wide open on his 
team. Miller was running to an area to spot up while New York defenders floated 
after him in chase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything feels like slow motion," is how Miller described the feeling. "You 
see the plays before they happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks, previously 8-0 at home in the playoffs, lost the lead when 
Workman's two free throws made it 72-72 with 8:10 left. Then they virtually 
lost any chance when Miller went three-pointer from straightaway, three-pointer 
from the right side and, following a miss by Kenny Williams, three-pointer from 
the right side -- after Antonio Davis had passed up a three-footer in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
 That capped a 23-3 run by the Pacers to open the fourth quarter and put them 
up, 81-73, with 5:53 remaining. Miller would finish eight of 10, including five 
of five on three-pointers, in the final period, during which he single-handedly 
outscored the Knicks, 25-16.

MARTINEZ OF OLD APPEARS; BASEBALL: HE GETS PLENTY OF SUPPORT FROM INGRAM, 
KARROS AS DODGERS WIN, 7-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He threw with the form for which he became known during his glory years of 
1990-91, when he won 37 games and then somehow, lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez's fastball is about 5 m.p.h. faster than in the last couple of 
seasons. He's getting his breaking ball over and keeping the ball down. And 
Wednesday night, after a humbling spring and a rocky start to this season, it 
all came together in a 7-0 complete-game victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 53,325 at Dodger Stadium, Martinez (4-2) staved off a three-game sweep 
by the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger offense ignited against Cardinal starter Bob Tewksbury (8-3), who 
lasted four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very strong the whole way tonight, although my back stiffened up the 
last couple of innings," said Martinez, who lowered his earned-run average to 
3.91. "I have a lot more concentration now. I'm a lot more relaxed because I've 
been pitching well." 
</P>
<P>
 Garey Ingram and Eric Karros each had three hits, knocked in two runs and 
scored one. Karros hit his seventh home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi went three for four and scored two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram gave Martinez all the runs he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been called up to the Dodgers on May 15 to add some speed to the lineup 
and to put another infielder on the bench, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when it looked as if it was time for Ingram to start packing for double-A 
San Antonio, Delino DeShields and Jeff Treadway were injured in the same game. 
On Wednesday night, leadoff hitter Brett Butler missed the game to be with his 
mother, who is having surgery today. So Ingram, who still can't believe he is 
here, led off, and -- as when he homered in his debut -- rose to the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first time I've seen 50,000 people waving beach towels," said 
Ingram, referring to a Dodger promotion. "But I've seen a lot of things up 
there for the first time. I didn't think I was going to feel this comfortable, 
but the players have made me feel that way. They give me advice, and I've taken 
it and so far it's worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who pitched his first shutout since Aug. 22 of last season, was 
exceptional for the first four innings, giving up two hits and retiring 12 of 
the first 14 batters. He got into trouble in the fifth, when he gave up hits to 
Mark Whiten and Luis Alicea, who was pinch-hitting for Tewksbury, then walked 
Bernard Gilkey to load the bases with two out. But Martinez induced Ozzie Smith 
to pop out to Jose Offerman to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez also stranded runners in scoring position in the sixth, eighth and 
ninth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Dodgers' two-run fourth inning, Offerman and Manager Tom Lasorda 
clashed in the dugout when Offerman didn't show much effort when running out a 
sacrifice bunt. Offerman appeared to be unhappy about being told to sacrifice 
with Martinez to bat next. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman wouldn't talk about the incident, and Lasorda said it happened 
because of Offerman's frustration offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman's batting average dropped to .200 after he went 0 for 3 Wednesday.

MORNING BRIEFING: DON'T PRESS IT: NEW WRINKLE WAS NORMAN'S

 Dale Robertson of the Houston Chronicle wrote that Guy Lewis, former 
University of Houston basketball coach, "showed John Wooden the full-court 
press that helped make Wooden the most successful college coach in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA installed the zone press in the 1963-64 season, when the Bruins won their 
first NCAA basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Norman, an assistant to Wooden at the time, suggested the tactic. Norman 
said Lewis' input was zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: When the Utah Jazz was an expansion team in New Orleans, who was 
the coach in the inaugural 1974-75 season?  
</P>
<P>
 Out of touch: Norm Cash, former Detroit Tiger first baseman, said of his 1,081 
strikeouts: "Prorated at 500 at-bats a year, that means that for two years out 
of the 14 I played, I never touched the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Wanderlust: Lou Saban, the Larry Brown of football, has another job at another 
level. He's the coach of the Milwaukee Mustangs of the Arena Football League.  
</P>
<P>
 Saban has coached on the pro level with Buffalo, Denver and Boston, the 
college level with Miami, Army, Northwestern, Peru (Neb.) State and Central 
Florida, the semipro level with the Middle Georgia Heat Wave, and returned to 
coach at the high school level in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Saban: According to Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel, when Saban was 
at Central Florida in 1984 and '85, his friends called him by his nickname "Two 
Point Two." Why? His average stay at any job was 2.2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch! From David Letterman: "I bought a new Jennifer Capriati racket for $89

TRACK AND FIELD / NCAA CHAMPIONSHIPS; NEARLY FOULED OUT, USC'S KISS RALLIES TO 
WIN HAMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hammer thrower Balazs Kiss, troubled by an injured hip and in danger of not 
qualifying for the final, Wednesday became the first USC athlete in 26 years to 
win consecutive titles at the NCAA track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore from Hungary won his second consecutive hammer throw 
championship with a heave of 246 feet 5 inches, despite injuring his right hip 
on his first throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiss, the heavy favorite, fouled on his first two throws and was in danger of 
not making the nine-man final from the original field of 17. But his third 
throw of 225-9 moved him into sixth place, and after that he improved on each 
try. 
</P>
<P>
 He took the lead in Round 4 at 239-10 and went 242-3 on his fifth attempt, 
before making his winning throw. 
</P>
<P>
 The last USC athlete to win two consecutive titles in the NCAA championships 
was 110-meter hurdler Earl McCullouch in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiss believes he can surpass 260 feet this summer, if he can maintain his 
composure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on the doorstep of making it big time," said Kiss, who has been 
surpassing 250 feet during practice, "but I'm too nervous to do it just yet. A 
big throw scares me. I'm scared of throwing well." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Papadimitriou of Texas El Paso finished second at 237-7, beating 
third-place finisher Roman Linscheid of St. John's by two inches. 
</P>
<P>
 John Godina of UCLA, who injured his right pectoral muscle this year, won the 
men's discus title at 198-5, the shortest winning throw since 1986. He will try 
for a meet double Saturday in the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Tansley of Cal State Fullerton advanced Wednesday to the finals in the 
3,000-meter steeplechase at the NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field 
Championships at Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
 Tansley, a senior from San Clemente High, finished in 8 minutes 57.12 seconds, 
placing seventh in his heat to advance to Friday's final. 
</P>
<P>
 David Mayeda of UC Irvine failed to advance in the 400 intermediate hurdles, 
running 52.41 to finish seventh in his heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Ann Parris of Louisiana State, the defending champion in the women's 
400-meter hurdles, gave the Tigers a start toward their eighth consecutive team 
title, winning her semifinal in 56.60 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU, the two-time defending champion in the women's 400 relay, also won its 
heat in 43.92.

 Hammer thrower Balazs Kiss, troubled by an injured hip and in danger of not 
qualifying for the final, Wednesday became the first USC athlete in 26 years to 
win consecutive titles at the NCAA track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 He took the lead in Round 4 at 239-10 and went 242-3 on his fifth attempt, 
before making his winning throw. 
</P>
<P>
 After the second foul, Kiss had a reassuring talk with throwing coach Dan 
Lange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Don't worry, you've got it,' " Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," Kiss said. "I just wanted to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kiss said, "I was definitely worried. I was a nervous wreck." 
</P>
<P>
 The last USC athlete to win two consecutive titles in the NCAA championships 
was 110-meter hurdler Earl McCullouch in 1967-68.

FRENCH OPEN / MEN; THE REIGN IN SPAIN IS MAINLY ON THE CLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alberto Berasategui is the latest clay court specialist from Spain's deep 
reserve to arrive in Paris with a wicked topspin and a resolve to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Following countryman Sergi Bruguera, Berasategui advanced to the semifinals of 
the French Open Wednesday with an efficient 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory over 
fifth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bruguera, Berasategui has yet to lose a set in reaching his first Grand 
Slam tournament semifinal round. Berasategui has played only 12 sets in six 
matches, having won twice when opponents retired because of pulled stomach 
muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 He will play Magnus Larsson of Sweden, who saved six match points in the third 
set, then blew past German teen-ager Henrik Dreekmann, 3-6, 6-7 (7-1), 7-6 
(7-3), 6-0, 6-1, in Wednesday's other quarterfinal match. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the attention was on Berasategui's upset of the last remaining 
seeded player in the men's lower bracket. The hard-serving Ivanisevic had a 
great opportunity to reach the final at Roland Garros Stadium, yet seemed to 
give it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Ivanisevic routed Berasategui, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2, in the second round 
of the French Open in their only other meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Berasategui, whose second-round appearance last year was his best previous 
Grand Slam performance, has an unusual grip that has all the tennis technicians 
talking. He uses a severe backhand grip to hit forehands, a shot that often 
confounds opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the shot, Berasategui twists his arm awkwardly, with his palm on the 
underside of the grip, and hits the ball with the same face of the racket as 
with his backhand. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I played like that, the ball would be in my shoes," said Imanol Bollegui, 
Berasategui's childhood coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Berasategui started using the grip when he was a 9-year-old playing in 
Arrigorriaga, a village in the northwestern Basque region of Spain. He has 
stuck with it because it seems to work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it was Ivanisevic who could not get a grip. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have to do anything -- nothing," Ivanisevic said. "It was a 
disgusting game. I never played like that in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic has advanced past the quarterfinals in only two Grand Slam events, 
but was playing his seventh quarterfinal match. Despite his experience, he was 
as flat as a crepe on a boiling day in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-handed Croatian was impatient, playing into Berasategui's game. 
Ivanisevic's big serve deserted him with his shot selection. Even when he had 
an open court at the net, Ivanisevic could not convert. He had 69 unforced 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a little bit nervous, but I gave him everything," Ivanisevic said. "I 
gave him a nice present." 
</P>
<P>
 Berasategui gladly accepted the gift as he stayed on the baseline, content to 
watch his opponent make mistake after mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was going to be much harder for me," the Spaniard said. "I 
thought the key was my (service) return." 
</P>
<P>
 All it took for Berasategui to gain the advantage was a break in the seventh 
game of the first set. Ivanisevic hit a forehand into the net, then sent a ball 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 From that juncture, Berasategui never wavered. And the more Ivanisevic failed 
to volley with confidence, the more he got into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Berasategui even ended it on a second-serve ace, something Ivanisevic might 
have done had he played his game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreekmann, 19, looked as if his incredible run at Roland Garros would continue 
when he dominated the first two sets. Then it quickly ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsson's comeback was unremarkable, considering Dreekmann's total collapse, 
and midway through the fourth set it was evident the German was going down. 
</P>
<P>
 After fending off the match points with clutch serving, Larsson won 11 
consecutive games, including the third-set tiebreaker. He lost only six points 
in the fourth set and ended with 19 aces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to do after the third set," Dreekmann said. "I was only 
thinking of the six match points I had, and then the fourth set was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 So was Dreekmann. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Martina Navratilova and Mark Woodforde of Australia lost to Natalia Medvedeva 
of Ukraine and Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands, 6-7 (7-2), 6-4, 7-5, in the 
third round of mixed doubles, ousting Navratilova completely from her final 
French Open. . . . After losing in the third round of women's singles, Lindsay 
Davenport said she could hardly wait to return to her friends at Murrieta 
Valley High. But wait she will, because she and Lisa Raymond of Wayne, Pa., 
advanced to the women's doubles semifinals with a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Nicole 
Provis of Australia and Elna Reinach of South Africa.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
 I can do without "The Fishin' Hole," "Body Shaping," "The National Spelling 
Bee," and even "The College Cheerleading Championships," but it is during times 
like these that I wonder how I survived all those decades without ESPN. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The major networks still put ice hockey right up there in importance with 
field hockey, but the all-sports network has allowed us to enjoy one of the 
most exciting Stanley Cup tournaments ever. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Friday, ESPN will televise another of my favorite things -- the 
College World Series. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Most of these players actually run full speed to first base after hitting 
routine ground balls even though they are not being paid $5,000 per plate 
appearance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN will televise what could be as many as 13 tournament games, starting with 
Cal State Fullerton-Georgia Tech on Friday at 12:30 p.m. ESPN2 will show four 
and CBS two, including the title game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals on Tuesday, Kirk McLean demonstrated the 
importance of a hot goaltender. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers outplayed the Vancouver Canucks most of the night, 
including overtime, but lost. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened to the Kings last year against the Montreal masked 
man, Patrick Roy, during the championship series. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was as though they were a baseball team facing a fresh Sandy Koufax five 
consecutive games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among the most improved performers during the playoffs is ESPN analyst Barry 
Melrose, the Kings' coach who has become more comfortable in front of the 
cameras and is showing his sense of humor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 More surprising than the Canucks' one game lead over New York is the Pacers' 
one-game lead over New York. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller's fourth quarter explosion Wednesday night was exactly what the 
dullest NBA tournament in memory needed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Is it too late to switch coach of the year ballots to Larry Brown? . . .

 The Dodgers might always regret not acquiring Ozzie Smith when they had the 
chance in 1990. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dodger farm report: Through 29 games at Albuquerque, Billy Ashley was batting 
.371 with nine home runs and 30 runs batted in.At San Antonio, Chan Ho Park is 
0-2 with a 3.34 earned-run average and has struck out 36 and walked 21 in 29 
2/3 innings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Bob Knight nor Pete Newell had watched his horse, Gogarty, during any 
of his eight consecutive defeats. Finally, Newell went to see him run Sunday at 
Hollywood Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If Gogarty doesn't win today," Newell told trainer Wayne Lukas, "we'll have 
to get 'the Great Motivator' out there to look him in the eye." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Gogarty, forewarned, won easily. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 While The Wicked North's owner, Philip Hersh, keeps trying to regain last 
March's Santa Anita Handicap from Stuka in the courts, the two horses will take 
to the track Sunday in the $300,000 Californian Stakes at Hollywood Park. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth annual Toyota/Jerry Buss celebrity golf tournament, proceeds 
benefiting the Lakers-YMCA Junior League, will be held Monday at Riviera 
Country Club. Tickets for a dinner and auction at 6:30 p.m. are available. . .

</P>
<P>
 USC sent a small, but talented, team to the NCAA men's track and field meet at 
Boise State, reviving memories of the four-man team that won the Trojans' 12th 
championship in 1943 at Evanston, Ill. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Local schools used to dominate the national meet but haven't won since UCLA in 
1988. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Light-flyweight champion Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez -- who, at 5 feet 1 and 
108 pounds, is smaller than most jockeys -- has been added to the July 15 card 
at Hollywood Park. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bert Cooper, who is dangerous for a few rounds and once had Evander Holyfield 
in big trouble, may be able to give Jeremy Williams a test on the Olympic 
Auditorium's next show June 24. . . .

 What do Dick Enberg, Madonna and Laker publicist John Black have in common? 
They all lived in Bay City, Mich. . . . Home-field disadvantage: It won't 
surprise me if 90% of the crowd Saturday at the Rose Bowl roots for Mexico 
against the U.S. soccer team. . . .

 Dave Taylor, who wants to get into coaching, would be a good choice to fill 
the vacancy at the Kings' Phoenix farm club in the International Hockey League.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ALVAREZ DOESN'T WIN, BUT HE DOESN'T LOSE

 The Chicago White Sox rallied for three runs in the ninth inning Wednesday 
night in New York, beating the Yankees, 5-4, and preserving Wilson Alvarez's 
15-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Tartabull homered and drove in three runs, helping the Yankees take a 
4-2 lead into the ninth inning and putting Alvarez in danger of losing his 
first game since last Aug. 11. Instead, he wound up with a no-decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched in here," Alvarez said. "I thought, 'Everything is over, the streak 
is over and we start over again.' I'm not going to give up with this team 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Joey Cora drew a leadoff walk from Bob Wickman (2-1), Tim Raines 
singled with one out and pinch-hitter Warren Newson walked, loading the bases 
in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Thomas hit a sacrifice fly to the wall in right field, making it 4-3. 
Julio Franco then singled home the tying run and, after Steve Howe relieved, 
Robin Ventura singled home the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez remained 8-0 this season. His 15 consecutive victories in the regular 
season tie the White Sox record set by LaMarr Hoyt. Alvarez pitched six 
innings, gave up five hits and walked seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee starter Jimmy Key, trying for his seventh consecutive victory, allowed 
two runs and five hits in six innings. Wickman relieved to start the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Cook (3-0) was the winner, and Roberto Hernandez struck out the side in 
the ninth for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 11, Baltimore 3 -- Travis Fryman went five for five and Tim Belcher 
pitched eight strong innings as the Tigers extended their winning streak to a 
season-high four games by beating the Orioles at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Bautista went three for four with a homer, helping the Tigers vault past 
Toronto and out of last place in the AL East for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 4, Kansas City 2 -- Scott Cooper's single broke an eighth-inning tie as 
the Red Sox beat the Royals at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The game matched Roger Clemens and David Cone, who have two of the top five 
earned-run averages in the American League. However, they weren't involved in 
the decision. Each gave up two runs in seven innings; Clemens allowed four hits 
and Cone five. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone, trying to become baseball's first nine-game winner, was replaced by Mike 
Magnante (1-2) starting the eighth with the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 8, Texas 1 -- Brian Harper drove in three runs and Cal Eldred 
pitched a six-hitter at Milwaukee as the Brewers ended the Rangers' three-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's two-run single with the bases loaded in the seventh inning gave 
Milwaukee a 5-1 lead. Harper, who also singled in the fourth and was hit by a 
pitch in his first at-bat, had a sacrifice fly in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Eldred (5-6) allowed one run, striking out five and walking three for his 
second complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 2, Seattle 1 -- Chuck Knoblauch had two run-scoring doubles to lead 
the Twins to a victory at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Tapani (6-2) won his fifth in a row for the Twins, giving up one run and 
seven hits. He struck out six and walked one in eight innings. He has allowed 
five runs in 32 2/3 innings over his last four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 9, Toronto 5 -- A pinch-hit and a hit batter produced two runs in the 
eighth inning as the Athletics swept a three-game series from the Blue Jays at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 With the A's trailing, 5-4, Brent Gates opened the eighth inning with a 
double. With one out, Mike Bordick walked and pinch-hitter Ruben Sierra singled 
off Tony Castillo (2-1) to tie the score. Rickey Henderson then walked to load 
the bases. One out later, Geronimo Berroa was hit by a pitch to drive in 
Bordick. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Welch (1-5) pitched 2 2/3 innings for the victory.

HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS / SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' FINALS; SANTA BARBARA WINS 7TH 
CONSECUTIVE TITLE

<P>
 The Santa Barbara Dons won their seventh consecutive Southern Section Division 
I boys' tennis championship with a 17 2/3-3 1/3 victory over third-seeded Dana 
Hills Wednesday at Knowlwood Tennis Club in Montecito. 
</P>

A'S COMPLETE SWEEP OF BLUE JAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was just like the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bob Welch pitching effectively and his teammates rallying late, the A's 
finished a three-game sweep of Toronto with a 9-5 victory Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen closely, though, and it becomes apparent that those old days are but a 
distant memory, and not anything like these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to let our young players see what winning a series is like," said 
Terry Steinbach, who had three hits and scored twice. "I can't emphasize how 
much fun winning is." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have success, your confidence grows, and then you have a chance for 
some more success," A's manager Tony La Russa said after his last-place team's 
fifth straight win against Toronto this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody would have laid any bets on a sweep for us," he said, 
"but our pitching was very good and we got three hard-earned wins." 
</P>
<P>
 The A's scored twice in the eighth and three times in the ninth to erase a 5-4 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Gates opened the eighth with a double off Tony Castillo (1-2). Mike 
Bordick walked an out later and Ruben Sierra hit a pinch single to score Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickey Henderson walked to load the bases and Stan Javier fanned, but Castillo 
hit Gerronimo Berroa in the left shoulder to force in the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember the last time I hit a right-handed batter," said the 
left-handed Castillo. "Today I do it in a 5-5 game." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no chance to get out of the way," Berroa said. "But I feel no pain 
because we won the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The A's added three runs in the ninth against Scott Brow. Bordick, who went 
2-for-4 and scored three times, hit a two-run double and Javier chipped in with 
a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch (1-5) worked 2 2-3 innings in relief of Todd Van Poppel to win for the 
first time since last Aug. 29th. Van Poppel lasted only 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto starter Al Leiter went six innings, allowing four runs on eight hits 
while striking out seven and walking one. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland took its first lead in the sixth, 4-3, on Gates' sacrifice fly and 
Scott Brosius' run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Alomar hit his fifth homer with a man aboard in the bottom of the 
inning to put the Jays back in front 5-4, setting up the late rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays took the lead in the second on Ed Sprague's fifth home run, but 
Javier's RBI fielder's choice tied it in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Molitor's run-scoring double put the Jays back on top in the bottom of 
the inning, but Steinbach's RBI double re-tied it in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 John Olerud's RBI double put the Blue Jays ahead again in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great for us to win three games in a row," Rickey Henderson said. "But 
now we have to continue winning, we have to take it from here."

 Brentwood 14 1/3, Pasadena Poly 6 2/3 -- In a key victory, Brentwood's No. 2 
doubles team of Greg Lewis and Kevin Pivnick upset Poly's No. 1 doubles team of 
Jason Tan and David Newhall, 6-3, to clinch the Division III title for 
Brentwood (19-3) at the Riviera Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Sarkisian, Brentwood's first-year coach, wasn't surprised at Lewis and 
Pivnick's clutch play, saying: "When Greg plays well, he plays very well, and 
even when Kevin plays bad, he plays well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and Pivnick won all three of their sets, as did Brentwood's No. 1 
doubles team of Tyler Barnett and Scott Kaufman. Adam Gross, Brentwood's No. 1 
singles player, also won all three of his sets. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth time in six years that these two teams have met in the 
Southern Section final. Pasadena Poly (19-4) defeated Brentwood for the title 
in 1989, '91 and '92; Brentwood beat Pasadena Poly for the championship in '90. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams made significant changes from their usual lineups in an attempt to 
win more points in doubles, but Brentwood prevailed, winning all but two 
doubles sets. WENDY WITHERSPOON

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS; DANA HILLS CAN'T STOP SANTA 
BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dana Hills Coach John Stephens thought he gave his team a pretty good speech 
before Wednesday's Southern Section Division I boys' tennis final against 
six-time champion Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them to relax and enjoy being an underdog," Stephens said. "There's no 
pressure on you." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, only freshman Brandon Fallon seemed to be listening. Fallon 
played loose, and his teammates played tight. The result was scary: Santa 
Barbara 17 2/3, Dana Hills 3 1/3. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he lost his last two sets, 6-4, 6-2, Fallon was the only Dolphin to win 
a first-round set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't intimidated because I play (junior) tournaments," he said. "I didn't 
feel like I should be nervous. It's just another match. I knew all the pressure 
was on them." 
</P>
<P>
 But the pressure got to Fallon's teammates early. David Bailey and Christian 
Spaulding had been the Dolphins' top doubles team all season, but they were 
soundly beaten by Santa Barbara's Bryan Corlett and Dave Armstrong, 6-1, in the 
first round. Bailey's serve was broken twice as he had three double faults in 
his first service game and two in his second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all came out intimidated," Bailey said. "They have a tradition going here, 
and it's tough to beat it." 
</P>
<P>
 Spaulding attempted to beat it by yelling his way to victory. But his shouts 
of "Yeah, that's huge," drew a code violation from the referee and seemed to 
only inspire the Santa Barbara players. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to come here with an attitude and they expected us to break down, 
but that's what makes our team so tough -- our mental toughness," Santa 
Barbara's Ian Carrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara's talent isn't bad either. The Dons didn't have a weak player in 
their lineup. In Nathan Jackmon and Jimmy Walker, they had two of the better 
players in Southern California. Add talent, mental toughness and a home crowd 
of almost 200 at Knowlwood Tennis Club, and the final score was fairly 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing at home would have helped, but the way we played (Wednesday), it 
wouldn't have mattered where we played," Stephens said. "I thought our doubles 
would play a lot better. They've been our strength all year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dana Hills only got victories from Fallon and Erik Lundblad in singles and 
Mike Baxi and Hanley Ernst in doubles. The Dolphins finished 23-1 and lost to 
Santa Barbara in the final for the second time in four years. The Dons (25-0) 
have won seven consecutive Division I titles and nine of the last 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is almost like playing the (Palos Verdes) Peninsula girls," Stephens 
said. "Everybody's playing to get to the other side of the draw so they can get 
to the finals. You love getting here. But going into the finals, knowing the 
odds of winning are not good, is tough." 
</P>
<P>
 So tough that Carrera even empathized with the other Division I teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guy said to me (Wednesday), 'What are you guys doing, buying your 
players?,' " Carrera said. "I told him that it's just a good tennis community. 
What are we supposed to do, not accept the players that come in here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens, and every other Division I tennis coach, probably wouldn't have too 
much trouble answering, "Yes," to that question.

DESPITE PLANS, ERHAAB CLOSES TO WIN ENGLISH DERBY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 215th English Derby didn't go according to plan for Erhaab, but he won 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying back to avoid trouble in the middle of the race, Erhaab closed with a 
rush in the final 100 yards of the 1 1/2-mile race under 52-year-old Willie 
Carson and won by 1 1/4 lengths Wednesday before some 100,000, including Queen 
Elizabeth II.

<P>
 Kings Theater finished second, 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Colonel Collins, with 
Mister Baileys fourth in the field of 25 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway Flyer, owned by golfer Gary Player, finished 21st. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly wasn't the plan," winning trainer John Dunlop said after his 
colt came from far back. "But there was a lot of trouble in the middle of the 
race, and Willie didn't want to get involved. I thought that he was so far back 
he couldn't win from there. He got a lovely ride through (traffic), and then I 
thought we would finish a respectable fourth."

THE WHEELS STAYED ON DURING A ROUGH RIDE; HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS: WHILE COACHES AND 
PLAYERS WERE CHANGING, CALABASAS REMAINED FOCUSED, FINALLY DEFEATING SANTA YNEZ 
FOR THE DIVISION IV CHAMPIONSHIP.

<P>
 The Calabasas High boys' tennis team must have sometimes felt like a band of 
racket-carrying orphans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes have played for three coaches this year -- the last one taking 
over with only three weeks remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 They also lost their No. 1 singles player, Jason Weiss (before the season 
because of injury) and their No. 2 singles player, Jason Cook (at midseason 
after he withdrew from school). 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a rough ride with potholes and blowouts, but it had a smooth 
ending on Wednesday when Calabasas defeated Santa Ynez, 13 2/3-7 1/3, at Agoura 
High for the Southern Section Division IV championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes (17-4), who won five section titles in six seasons from 1981-86, 
hadn't reached the final in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some question whether they would make it this year after fourth-year 
Coach Casey Allen resigned before a key match against Burbank. Athletic 
Director Cindy Jones served as interim coach for several weeks until Ed Charles 
was named late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of Wednesday's final, Charles, a former coach at Cal State Los 
Angeles, called the Coyotes cocky and questioned their work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry Calabasas players answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scoreboard, baby," said senior doubles player Phil Abramson. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson and senior Anupam Mishra swept three sets at No. 1 doubles, losing 
only two games. The No. 2 doubles team of Darren Miller and Jason Arashaben did 
the same.  
</P>
<P>
 And thanks to the doubles teams -- which won eight of nine sets for 10 2/3 of 
Calabasas' points -- the Coyotes answered the verbal challenge by Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were upset," Abramson said, "because we thought it was a back-stabbing 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't think that it was fair for me to say that about them," Charles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at the same time we kicked butt. (It was time) for them to get their act 
together and really work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles applauded Wednesday's performance, after finding a way to spark a team 
that might have been numbed by all the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't play well, but they played hard," Charles said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't give up. They wanted it really bad. For the first time today they 
came together. They were cheering each other. They were talking to each other 
on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what being a team is about. We haven't had that until today. I'm 
really happy and proud for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas trailed, 2-0, early after singles players Jeff Herz and Alex Wan 
dropped their opening matches. But the Coyotes pulled ahead, 5-2, after the 
first round of sets in the round-robin match. They led, 8 2/3-5 1/3, after two 
rounds but clinched it early in the third round when Mishra and Abramson 
defeated James Reid and Edwin Portillo, 6-0, and Miller and Arashaben beat Tony 
Cirincione and Brandon Dotson, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave the Coyotes an 11 1/3-5 1/3 lead when they needed 10 2/3 to clinch.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: AS HE NEARS 49, STILL NO BEND IN THE IRONMAN 
</P>

 Ivan Stewart, the ironman of Baja California off-road racing, won his first 
Baja 500 in 1974 while driving with Bill Hrynko. Since then, Stewart has won 
six more -- including the last three -- driving solo in all but one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seem to thrive on the races in Mexico because they're longer and rougher 
than the others," Stewart said as he prepared to celebrate his 49th birthday 
Saturday with yet another run through Baja in his single-seat Toyota pickup 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who lives near the Mexican border in Alpine, will be in the 465-mile 
SCORE/Tecate Trophy-Truck race, which will start in Ensenada and finish in 
Santo Tomas, 30 miles south of Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday will be the 26th running of the SCORE Baja 500 for all other 
classes. More than 200 entries are expected. They will start half an hour after 
the elite truck class and follow the same course. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the fourth of seven races in the SCORE International desert 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, the defending series champion, won the San Felipe 250 last February 
in Mexico, but still trails the Simon brothers, Paul and Dave, of Fallbrook, in 
the series standings. The Simons won both north-of-the-border races, the Parker 
400 and Nevada 400, in their Ford pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one reason we've been so successful in Baja is that my Toyota was 
built to maneuver the tight and twisty courses we see in Mexico," Stewart said 
of the high-tech model built by Cal Wells' Precision Preparation Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Stewart won both the Baja 500 and the Baja 1,000 en route to the 
series championship. In more than two decades of desert racing, Stewart has 11 
Baja 500 class victories, two Baja 1,000s and 21 overall titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been asked a lot recently about how much longer I expect to race," he 
said. "As long as I'm still competitive and winning races, you'll see me in the 
driver's seat."  
</P>
<P>
 Other serious challengers are Larry Ragland of Phoenix and Roger Mears of 
Bakersfield, in Chevrolets; Rob MacCachren of Las Vegas, in a Ford, and Walker 
Evans and Scott Douglas, both of Riverside, in Dodges. Making his Trophy-Truck 
debut in a Chevrolet will be Doug Fortin, 24, of Jamul, a second-generation 
off-road racing driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The course features 7,000 feet of elevation changes from sea level to the 
pine-covered mountains south of Tecate before returning to sea level near the 
Santo Tomas finish line. 
</P>

KENNEDY CONTINUES IMPRESSIVE TEAR, RIPS APART SYLMAR, 17-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carlos Velazco has had better days -- to say the least. Wednesday, he would 
just as soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy High sent 47 batters to the plate and scored a 17-4 victory over 
Sylmar in a City Section 4-A Division quarterfinal baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Cougars (16-10), who have won 10 of their last 11 games, parlayed 
15 hits, 10 walks and two hit batters into a runaway victory. Kennedy, which 
finished second in the North Valley League, scored in each inning but the 
seventh and never let Sylmar into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been playing like this since we started playing league," Kennedy Coach 
Manny Alvarado said. "We've been on a tear for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy will face El Camino Real in a semifinal game Friday at a neutral site 
to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco (11-3), Sylmar's ace right-hander who had given up just 10 earned runs 
in the regular season, matched that total in 3 2/3 innings against Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a pretty smart pitcher," Alvarado said. "He won't throw a strike unless 
he has to. Today we made him throw in the strike zone, which I guess he isn't 
accustomed to doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's Richard Prieto hit a three-run double in the second and George 
Kassis hit a three-run double in the fourth to fuel a 10-2 lead. Kassis' 
base-clearing liner down the left-field foul line with two out in the fourth 
chased Velazco, who said he had trouble figuring out the umpire's strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you throw down the middle, sooner or later . . . ," said Velazco, who is 
22-4 in two seasons. "I was falling behind on every other hitter. You just 
can't do that when the game is on line. That's what I did and this is the 
result." 
</P>
<P>
 Velazco allowed nine hits, walked five and hit a batter before being relieved 
by his younger brother Rafael in the fourth. Rafael Velazco didn't last long 
however, facing five batters and retiring only one. Mario Cervantes relieved 
with bases loaded and none out in the fifth and promptly gave up a two-run 
single by David Soto, who went three for four with three runs batted in. Prieto 
hit a two-run triple in the sixth to extend the lead to 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's Brad Cooperman (9-4) allowed nine hits, walked three and picked up 
his second playoff victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Diaz, who went four for four with two RBIs, hit a run-scoring double in 
the third for the Spartans' first run. Carlos Velazco followed with a single to 
drive in Diaz to cut the lead to 6-2. Sylmar added two runs in the fifth to 
make it 13-4, but it was too little, too late for the Spartans, who lost three 
of their last four games after posting a 20-game win streak.

MAKE NO MISTAKE, UNHERALDED TAFT CONTINUES ITS ADVANCE, 8-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a fine line between opportunism and luck -- and Taft High keeps blurring 
the boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the Toreadors' 8-3 victory over Granada Hills in a City 
Section 4-A Division baseball quarterfinal Wednesday appeared to be a 
gift-wrapped triumph replete with ugly plays, poor decisions and even worse 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the Toreadors' seven-run sixth inning featured five Granada Hills 
errors and botches of both a suicide squeeze and a double steal that worked 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the eye of the beholder is a powerful perspective. Taft players saw it as 
a natural outcome of an aggressive offense, and even Granada Hills Coach Darryl 
Stroh saw a beautiful strategy by the Toreadors amid the torrent of Highlander 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way to play those close pressure games," Stroh said. "Put a lot of 
pressure on the other kids -- that's the whole idea, and they did it very well. 
I really appreciate that type of game." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Taft (16-15), seeded 13th entering the playoffs, now that it has 
advanced to the semifinals against Chatsworth after springing two consecutive 
upsets. The Toreadors defeated Poly, seeded fourth, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Taft won that game by parlaying four errors and a balk by Poly into 
six runs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we keep hitting the ball and putting it in play, we force them to 
make errors," catcher Nick Andrisano said. "And the last two games have proved 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 This game also illustrated the power of the bunt. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 1-1, Taft's Greg Venger led off the sixth with a single 
and advanced to second on Jimmy Landress' throwing error. Nick Andrisano 
followed with a sacrifice and Granada Hills pitcher Josh Goldberg tried to 
throw out Venger at third, but too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Then things unraveled. Andrisano intentionally got picked off first to get in 
a rundown, hoping that Venger would score from third while the defense was 
preoccupied, the play on which Taft scored its first run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Granada Hills (16-8) read the play, threw instead to third and got Venger 
in a rundown. Third baseman Eddie Kinsler chased Venger toward home plate, but 
held the ball too long and his throw arrived at the plate the same time Venger 
did. The ball popped free of Jarrett Gold's glove and Taft led, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Two batters later, Mike Andrisano laid down a sacrifice bunt that Goldberg 
fielded and threw into left field, and two more runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Even missed bunts turned out well. Andrisano scored when Granada Hills' Gold 
dropped the ball after batter Mike Rolbin missed making contact on a suicide 
squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to keep scrapping," Taft's Venger said, "until we get even 
further."

 To the uninitiated, the equestrian world often seems a closed set of gleaming 
horses, imported leather and swank riders. But this weekend, the gates to that 
world open to the rank and file at the Oaks Classic grand prix in San Juan 
Capistrano, one of the nation'stop equestrian show-jumping events. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual event began in 1986, when Joan Irvine Smith decided to bring 
European-style equestrian competition to the West Coast on her upscale horse 
property, The Oaks. Instead of a typical one-day show in a dusty riding ring, 
Smith strived for the ambience of a lavish, weekend-long event: a grass jumping 
course, manicured lawns, flowing champagne and other enticements that would 
draw world-class competitors. It worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the premiere horse show in the United States by 10 lengths. And I've 
been to every major event for the past 40 years," says Art Hawkins, horse show 
manager for The Oaks Classic. What sets the event apart is its spare-no-expense 
zeal for making its "guests," as observers are called, entertained and 
enthused. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Sunday, spectators can see horse-and-rider combinations -- some of 
them Olympic veterans -- scaling obstacles between five and six feet tall, 
manuevering around trees at full throttle and leaping over water hazards. All 
for the thrill of the ride and, yes, a chance to win up to $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part is that anyone can understand what is happening on the jumping 
field. Unlike many other equestrian disciplines, there is no mystery to show 
jumping: Either you knock down the obstacle or you don't. There are no points 
for style. The horse with the fastest time and fewest faults wins (see box on 
scoring, Page 11). 
</P>
<P>
 But what is deceptively easy to watch has not come easily to the competitors, 
be they two- or four-legged. It takes at least five years of daily blood, sweat 
and tears to bring even the most talented horse to grand-prix (Olympic) level; 
it can take a lifetime for a rider to reach those ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 One such top-ranked rider is Susie Hutchinson of Flintridge, an international 
champion. Now 41 (and a rider since she was 5), the 1992 American Grandprix 
Assn.'s rider of the year has won the spring Oaks Classic (there is a similar 
but smaller event in the fall) six of its eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hutchinson says she doesn't know why she has so consistently won at 
The Oaks, she does know that she loves the event. Galloping a horse at close to 
20 m.p.h. on The Oaks' grass course -- one of the few on the West Coast, is 
"like driving a fine-tuned race car," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grand prix horses are very special. They have a big heart, and they're very 
careful." She says she finds horses "very much like people -- they can wake up 
on the wrong side of the bed and surprise us (in competition). Horses are a lot 
smarter than people give them credit for; they outsmart us every day." 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies the challenge that sets show jumping apart from other 
international sports: A major part of the equation is not a ball or a racquet 
but a 1,200-pound animal with a mind of its own. The key is to persuade the 
horse to do what the rider wants, such as jumping over a scary-looking wall 
instead of stopping in front of it or running around it. The horse has to 
gallop aggressively between fences yet remain cool-headed enough to make sharp 
turns and maneuvers, be submissive to the rider's hands and take off from the 
exact point at which the rider sets up the horse before the jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very mental sport," Hutchinson said. "You have to stay focused, keep 
the horse focused and tune out the crowd. It's you and your horse against the 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is the great equalizer: the course. Those 12 to 20 obstacles (there 
is no required number), most of them brightly colored and set at precarious 
angles, are designed to test a horse's mettle as well as jumping ability. 
</P>
<P>
 The layout of each course varies with the style of the course's designer. 
Hutchinson, who has ridden hundreds of courses around the world, said she has 
never jumped the same course twice. And although there are no course 
requirements regarding the type of obstacles, most designers include several 
verticals and spreads (jumps for height and width, respectively), a 
combination, a wall and water or a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 James Passant, spokesman for the American Grandprix Assn., said all course 
designers have the same goal: "to create a perfect course." 
</P>
<P>
 "They want all the horses to go clean (without faults) or to finish in a dead 
heat, like in a Thoroughbred horse race," Passant said. Rarely, however, does 
that happen. So, he said, designers strive to make their courses difficult and 
challenging. "They use different configurations (of obstacles) but try to 
achieve the same result -- a thorough test for horse and rider." 
</P>
<P>
 A diagram of the course is posted shortly before the grand prix begins. Riders 
must memorize the order of the jumps (jumping them out of order or going off 
course means elimination). The horses, which do not set foot on the course 
before the competition, must trust the riders to guide them through a series of 
unfamiliar obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 The only "warm-ups" (practice jumps) take place in a separate arena before the 
jumping event begins. Spectators can get a feel for which horse-and-rider 
combinations are leading contenders by watching the riders put their horses 
through "schooling rounds" in the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the way a horse behaves in warm-up indicates how it will jump on the 
course. Spectators can watch riders schooling horses today from 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m. in three arenas (main ring, grass field and derby course), as well as in 
the warm-up area before Sunday's grand prix and other main classes.  
</P>
<P>
 How can you tell when a horse is jumping well, either in schooling sessions or 
on a course? Technicalities aside, Hutchinson said, "the smoother it looks -- 
the less you're gasping or holding your breath as you watch -- generally the 
better it is. When your eye is broken from a smooth picture, either the rider 
is being too rough (with the horse) or the horse isn't adjusting (his stride) 
as he should be." 
</P>
<P>
 If you see a smooth ride, she said, you're apt to see zero faults on the 
scoreboard when that ride is over. If more than one horse goes "clean" or 
"clear" (no jumping or time faults) in the first round, as is usually the case 
for a handful of horses, they return in a "jump-off," competing on a shortened 
course against the clock. The fences are realigned for more difficulty, the 
speed increased and the time reduced. It's nail-biting time, and the crowd 
loves it. 
</P>
<P>
 So do the riders, some of whom opt to compete Saturday (usually on different 
horses) in a simulated jump-off called the "Dash for Cash." It is a different 
event (or class) on a different course, but the goal is the same as in Sunday's 
grand prix -- to get around the course as quickly and as cleanly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Baylis, a British grand prix rider and trainer based in San Juan 
Capistrano, has competed three years in The Oaks' "dash" class. "It's like the 
final round of the grand prix, but it's the first and only round," she said. 
"People get excited for the (grand prix) jump-off, but the dash class is 
exciting all the way through. I love riding in it, and people love watching 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 If Saturday afternoon's dash lends a preview of Sunday's jump-off, spectators 
can get an even closer perspective by "walking the course" before the grand 
prix. Just as the riders do when the course is opened for inspection shortly 
before the class, you can walk among the obstacles and get a feel for what it's 
like to jump a fence taller than you are. (Just don't touch the jumps, move the 
flowers or disturb the riders, most of whom are happy to chat with spectators 
and give autographs after the event.) 
</P>
<P>
 Things to look for as you walk the course: 
</P>
<P>
 * Riders will be "stepping off" the distance between the fences (taking what 
appear to be giant steps) to determine how many strides their horses need to 
take between landing and the next takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look at the trees -- a distinctive and unusual part of The Oaks' grand prix 
course -- from various angles to see how the patterns of shadows and light, 
which can change in an instant as the sun pokes in and out or the wind blows, 
can affect a horse's depth perception. 
</P>
<P>
 * Walk up to the obstacles and examine them closely. Some of the "rails" 
(horizontal poles) will be easier for the horses to knock down than others 
because the "jump cups" (curved metal holders that attach the rails to the 
fences) vary in flatness or depth, a nuance you won't be able to detect from 
the sidelines, even with binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sunday's grand prix is the grand finale of The Oaks Classic, there are 
several other classes worth watching throughout the weekend. Today is strictly 
a schooling day; the competition begins Friday at 8:30 a.m. with a number of 
jumper events (at lower heights than the grand prix) and "hunter" classes -- 
which, unlike the jumping classes, are scored on the horse's "conformation" 
(physique) and style over fences. Those events resume Saturday at 8 a.m. and 
continue through the afternoon, wrapping up with the $7,500 "Dash for Cash." 
Sunday's events begin at 8 a.m. with three $10,000 classes; try to catch the 
Junior/Amateur "Acorn" Grand Prix about 11 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 General-admission spectators may take a picnic or buy lunch at one of the food 
concessions on the grounds, while those who purchase an advance "patron" pass 
will lunch under a tent at noon. Opening ceremonies for the grand prix begin at 
2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons and public alike need to dress for the weather; the event is held rain 
or shine. 
</P>
<P>
 General-admission seating is in open bleachers and lawn chairs provided by The 
Oaks, all of which have a good view of the course. If a certain obstacle -- 
particularly one along the outside rail -- catches your fancy, you can stand 
nearby. Whatever your vantage point, consider taking binoculars -- and don't 
even think about attending without sunglasses and sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 What: The Oaks Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Today, June 2, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Friday, June 3, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; 
Saturday and Sunday, June 4 and 5, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Note: end times may vary, 
depending on how long competions run.) 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Oaks, 28650 Ortega Highway, San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Interstate 5 to Ortega Highway, then east about two miles. The 
Oaks is on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: Today through Saturday, free; Sunday, $8 general admission 
(tickets may be purchased at the event site) and $150 to $200 for patrons 
(includes preferred seating and luncheon). 
</P>

 If you get "horsed-out" after a few hours, not to worry. There are plenty of 
more pedestrian diversions on the horse show grounds -- eating, drinking, 
shopping and browsing among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-food concessions and no-host bars will abound (look for food wagons and 
tented booths). About a dozen art galleries from throughout the state will 
display and sell works with equine and other motifs. Retail vendors will 
feature a range of merchandise, from the traditional Hermes booth (which 
markets high-end saddles and other leather goods) to a newcomer this year: 
Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Carney Campbell, a well-known Orange County equestrian who competed in 
hunter classes at the Oaks the past two years, works for Nordstrom. All weekend 
at the show she will display a new line of jeans by Roam that she has found 
particularly suited to equestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nordtrom booth will also carry equestrian-related and Western-style 
clothing, including T-shirts, blazers, blouses and dresses, along with jewelry 
and accessories. There will be fitting rooms on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and once you're all decked out, you can drive off in style: Mission Viejo 
Imports will have a Mercedes-Benz on display. It's for sale -- in the same 
price range as some of the horses. DARLENE RICKER

LET THE SUN SHINE; THIS YEAR'S CAJUN FEST WILL SEE SEVERAL RETURN ACTS, BUT 
ORGANIZERS HOPE RAIN ISN'T ONE OF THEM 
</P>

 Opening day of last year's annual Southern California Cajun & Zydeco Festival 
made the history books. But if festival promoter Franklin Zawacki has his way 
when the festival revs up in Long Beach this weekend, there won't be anything 
remotely close to a repeat performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set a record," Zawacki recalled recently by phone from his office in San 
Francisco. "One hundred years of recorded history, in the whole month of June, 
the most rainfall Long Beach (ever) had was one-twentieth of an inch. We got 1 
1/2 inches that first day." 
</P>
<P>
 The freak rainstorm put a damper on the festival's balance sheet -- Zawacki 
said the event wound up about $40,000 in the red. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's show, however, will have a more palatable first: Accordionist 
Walter Mouton and his band, the Scott Playboys, will be making their Southland 
debut. While regarded in Cajun music as among the best accordionists living, 
Mouton is little known outside the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides rarely traveling away from his home -- Zawacki said it's taken him six 
years of persuading to get Mouton out for this year's festival -- the 
accordionist reportedly has made only one studio recording, and that was a 
45-rpm single. This despite the fact he's been popular on the Louisiana 
dance-hall circuit for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 His band also is one of the few to visit the West Coast that incorporates the 
Cajun-country music hybrid that developed in the wake of Louisiana's oil boom 
of the 1930s. Once oil was discovered, thousands of workers flooded in from 
neighboring states and brought with them new instruments and styles of music 
that found their way into the basic Cajun band lineup of accordion, fiddle and 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Making return appearances to the festival are singer-songwriter D.L. Menard, 
accordionist-fiddler Steve Riley and his band, the Mamou Playboys, and Nathan & 
the Zydeco Cha-Chas. All will play both days of the fest, which takes place at 
Rainbow Lagoon across from Shoreline Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The Poullard Brothers Band -- with accordionist Edward and guitarist Danny -- 
will open Saturday, while Louisiana transplant Joe Simien, a veteran 
accordionist now living in Los Angeles, teams with Southland fiddler Lisa Haley 
to open Sunday's show. Gates open both days at 11, and the music begins at noon 
and runs until 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the music, dance lessons and music and cultural workshops, the 
festival features food booths offering such Louisiana-style dishes as 
jambalaya, gumbo and boiled crawfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, this year the festival will hold its first evening dance on 
Saturday in the Long Beach Convention Center, next to the Rainbow Lagoon. 
Mouton and Nathan & the Zydeco Cha-Chas will play. The dance will have a 
separate admission charge of $8 in advance, or $10 at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 What: The eighth annual Southern California Cajun & Zydeco Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday and Sunday, June 4 and 5, noon to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Rainbow Lagoon, Shoreline Drive at Linden Avenue, Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway north to the Long Beach (710) 
Freeway south, exit at Shoreline Drive and follow the signs to convention 
center parking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: Per day: $15 in advance, $17.50 at the door; $30 for a two-day 
pass. Children under 10 get in free. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (310) 427-3713.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK

 John Hammond 
</P>
<P>
 "Trouble No More" 
</P>
<P>
 Pointblank  
</P>
<P>
 Intensity has long been John Hammond's hallmark in the blues world. This 
30-year veteran's solo-acoustic shows typically take you to extremes of moaning 
anguish and hammering rhythmic drive that are beyond the reach of most fully 
armed electric blues bands. 
</P>
<P>
 But with "Trouble No More," Hammond takes a break from ultra-intensity and 
honors the idea that a wry attitude toward the human comedy is as much a part 
of the blues outlook as the hard-edged expression of devastating hurts and 
primal drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three tracks are acoustic. There's a yodeling duet with slide guitar 
honcho Roy Rogers, and a hilarious bit of Mose Allison-penned braggadocio 
featuring support from Canned Heat's bassist, Larry Taylor. Hammond's quietly 
devastated solo take on Willie McTell's "Love Changin' Blues" offers the 
album's deepest emotional probing. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, he gets comfortable and expert backing from Little Charlie and the 
Nightcats, the Sacramento band that counts Thomas Pynchon among its fans, 
judging from several appreciative nods in his most recent novel, "Vineland" 
(not that it has anything to do with the blues, but the same book contains a 
hilarious scene in which a posse of teen-agers on roller skates swoops down on 
South Coast Plaza to pull off a big jewelry heist). 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring his interest in looking at the comic side of life's setbacks, 
Hammond tackles "Fool's Paradise" and "Trouble Blues," both from the repertoire 
of Charles Brown, a master of hangdog humor. Hammond pays tribute by echoing 
Brown's coy, cottony, winking tone of voice, and the master himself is there to 
receive the homage, plinking along on piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the fun, the McTell song is the album's highlight. Hammond renders 
its lament about being sexually rejected in a soft, stricken voice, 
accompanying himself with wobbling slide guitar that evokes the staggering 
severity of the blow. In his six-minute performance, Hammond says more about 
the high emotional stakes of sexuality than Madonna, that supposed expert on 
all things carnal, has managed to express in her entire career. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hammond plays Friday, June 3, at 7 and 9 p.m. at the San Juan Capistrano 
Regional Library, 31495 El Camino Real, San Juan Capistrano. $5. (714)

THREE SISTERS ACT; 'SINGLE, MARRIED & DIVORCED' PUTS STATUS TO WORK FOR WOMEN 
DOING STAND-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To hear Suzy Soro tell it, coming up with "Single, Married & Divorced" was a 
matter of survival, filling a niche and trying to get some health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea first surfaced about a year ago, when Leslie Norris (who is married), 
who has the same agent as Soro (who is single), called her about going on the 
road together. But with comedy clubs shuttering throughout the country, the 
outlook wasn't bright. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be helpful for their stand-up, they agreed, if they could find a 
gimmick. "Single, Married and Divorced" was born. But before they could take it 
on the road, they thought they saw an easier road to success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came up with the idea to sell it to cable companies," Soro explained in a 
phone interview Tuesday from her home near the Hollywood Hills sign. "We also 
had a sitcom treatment. I just wanted to get some money for health insurance. 
But we couldn't sell it, and we were too lazy to go out and do it. We just 
wanted to sit back and count the money. Then my agent said we were going to 
have to do it live." 
</P>
<P>
 So persuaded, in February they cinched the other third of the act, which 
features single, married and divorced comics discussing their status. 
</P>
<P>
 It took some searching, but Soro and Norris finally ran into Jedda Jones for 
the divorced portion of the 90-minute show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three of us sat down, and Leslie came up with the (opening) song," Soro 
said. "Jedda, Leslie and I brainstormed the sketch: The Sizzle Sisters come out 
as really sleazy lounge singers from Las Vegas, and then we turn into ourselves 
and do a sketch. From there, we do our stand-up. Leslie and Jedda make up an 
excuse to leave, then I'm on stage. The other two come back, then the divorced 
girl takes me off, sort of a tag team to get everyone on and off." 
</P>
<P>
 Soro discusses how single women are taken advantage of, the drawbacks of 
dating and the purpose of singleness in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the recent earthquake," the Indiana native tells audiences, "a 
bookcase fell off the wall and onto the passenger side of my bed. 
Unfortunately, nobody was hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Norris, who was a 1992 comedy finalist on "Star Search," portrays the marrying 
kind and how they light up when someone speaks those three magic words: "I have 
money."  
</P>
<P>
 Jones, whose credits include film work in "Indecent Proposal" and "Jimmy 
Hollywood," spends her time explaining how Mr. Right went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 But lest one get the idea that this is an anti-male consortium, Soro is quick 
to counter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try very hard not to male-bash," said Soro, adding that the show attracts 
about a 60-40 blend of women and men. "We bend over backward not to be 
excessively cruel. We're presenting a point of view. We don't want to alienate 
men. Some men came to the show and loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 The production also fills a need that Soro said she noticed while working 
clubs around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "People asked why there weren't more women on the road. That got us thinking 
that women are clamoring for their voices to be heard. They're not seeing it in 
comedy clubs," Soro said, mentioning the Mommies and Mothers and Other 
Goddesses as two of the few acts offering such an outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 During the rambling interview, the health-insurance issue was about the only 
recurring theme. It has become a sore spot with Soro, who has been without 
coverage since December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too expensive," she said. "You can have insurance on your car or on you. 
It became a choice I had to make. And I'm not the only one; other comedians are 
in the same boat. We're hoping (President) Clinton's health-care package will 
help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Soro has been doing stand-up since 1983, a logical career step after forming a 
band with her sister in France (her mother is French, and Soro summered there 
growing up) that performed Gershwin songs, with comedy patter in between. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were terrible, but no one told us," Soro said, laughing at the memory. 
"When we moved to New York, my sister didn't want to do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In her 20s and working in France, the young singer graduated to headlining a 
revue in a club across from the Moulin Rouge. That experience gave her the 
confidence to go solo when she moved to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she's content to mix her solo career -- which boasts roles on "Seinfeld" 
and "Good Advice" as well as several cable shows -- with "Single, Married & 
Divorced." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the venture as a live show is working, but Soro hasn't given up on 
turning it into a sitcom or cable special. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like both to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 And, by her reckoning, that should bring in enough to get some health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Single, Married & Divorced." 
</P>
<P>
 When: Monday, June 6, at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Improv, 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to the Jamboree Road exit and 
head south. Turn left onto Campus Drive. The Improv is in the Irvine 
Marketplace shopping center, across from the UC Irvine campus. 
</P>

WANNA DANCE?: VISIONS: PLENTY OF GOOD TIMES IN SITE

 Even the most cutting-edge club promoter has to admit it's a dream: marketing 
a concept successfully for eight years under the same name, a club event that 
continues to attract crowds weekly. It might lack the coveted label of 
"underground," but among the county's trendies, promoter Danny Aguilar's 
Visions still stands for nonstop good times. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar's gig has had "temporary" stints (sometimes lasting three years) at 
various nightclubs around O.C., where he would set up shop one or two nights a 
week. At the Warehouse in Newport Beach, Visions celebrates its first 
anniversary this week, with lines still clamoring to get in every Thursday 
through Saturday. The two-story club keeps maximum occupancy at around 525, 
with about 800 to 1,000 patrons walking in and out the door on any Visions 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 An interior remodel spearheaded by Aguilar last year breathed new life into 
the Warehouse, which overlooks Newport Bay. The promoter drew from Coppola's 
recent "Dracula" flick: crimson velvet draped everywhere, the walls sponged in 
gold, classic art prints in gilded frames and miniature statues of gargoyles 
and Roman Renaissance figures also painted gold. 
</P>
<P>
 But regulars from any Visions era will also recognize signature trappings: 
video footage of the previous week's frolics flashing on TVs scattered 
throughout the club, a well-oiled staff and a slow moving line outside. 
</P>
<P>
 On the lower level, patrons can check out cover bands churning out numbers 
from Nirvana, Bob Marley and Black Crowes. Others wrap around the bar for the 
evening's drink specials -- offered downstairs to balance out the crowd, which 
tends to stay upstairs otherwise. Thursday's specials are Zima, domestic drafts 
and glasses of the house wine for $1 each, plus $2 you-call-its throughout the 
club. On Fridays and Saturdays, Zima, domestic drafts and house wine sell for 
$2. Regularly, domestic brews sell for around $3 and imports are about $4. A 
glass of wine is $2.75 to $4.75; wells, $3.25; sodas, $1.25. 
</P>
<P>
 If you get hungry, the kitchen serves fresh seafood, pasta and steak dinners 
($5.95 to $20.95) until 11 p.m.; appetizers ($3.95 to $9.95) are available 
until midnight. There's also a taco bar, offering three for $2 right up till 
the club closes. And if it's too noisy inside to dine, try the large outdoor 
patio, complete with heat lamps and a bay view. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it can get too noisy to even have fun in several spots throughout the 
club. It's a nightmare zone around the first-floor bar, where the music from 
upstairs filters down and clashes with the live sounds from the band room 
nearby. No number of cheap Zimas can better the situation. Upstairs too there 
are sound problems, especially opposite the dance floor, where the bass buzzes 
so loud that it turns songs into electrified mush. How the pool players there 
take it is beyond understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the pool players have some other concerns, since half of the eight 
available tables are lined up too close together in a narrow space that doubles 
as a walkway. Then there is the $10 hourly rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the party rages heavily upstairs, with deejay John Elliot at the helm 
moving the jampacked floor with a mainstream mix of old school, house and 
hip-hop. On the two-level floor, trendies, bodybuilders and plenty of beach 
babes cram the space. Bring a hankie, because it's a sweat pit. VISIONS

DO IT!: GOT NO OTHER FISH TO FRY? TRY ESTANCIA'S BENEFIT 5K 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

contributes to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The organizers of the Fish Fry 5000, a Costa Mesa 5K run planned for Sunday, 
have a bit of competition this weekend for their first-time event.  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, there's the Scenic 5K in Corona del Mar, an established run with 
a sizable following, while Sunday will see return of the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center Triathlon in Mission Viejo, a top national event. 
</P>
<P>
 John Carpenter, director of the Fish Fry 5000, said he and other organizers 
were aware of the other events but decided on this weekend because it would 
give them a tie-in with the Costa Mesa Fish Fry, a longtime fixture sponsored 
by a local Lions Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The run is designed as a fund-raiser for the Estancia High School athletic 
department, which has been faced with a shrinking budget in recent years.  
</P>
<P>
 "The general idea was to get a unified fund-raiser that all the coaches could 
get behind," said Carpenter, the school's swim and water polo coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said he hopes the Fish Fry will build into an annual event with a 
following of its own. Though this is a building year for the run, Carpenter 
hopes the event will at least break even. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're set up to handle 1,000 runners, so the more that come the merrier." 
</P>
<P>
 The course for the 5K starts at the high school and continues to the nearby 
bluffs overlooking the Santa Ana River. Besides following the scenic 
bluff-tops, it will also descend to river level. About half the run is on 
asphalt streets, about half on dirt paths; the climbs help make it a relatively 
challenging course, Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also offered will be a 2K walk for those who'd rather not run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters age 9 to 13 can test their baseball skills Saturday and Sunday in 
Major League Baseball's Pitch, Hit and Run competition at Fountain Valley's 
Mile Square Park. Top finishers will qualify for the regional competition in 
San Diego and could move on from there.  
</P>
<P>
 Entry fee is $12. Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and noon to 4 p.m. 
Sunday. For information, call (310) 829-5226. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Fish Fry 5000. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Sunday, June 5, 7:30 a.m for the 5K and 8 a.m. for the 2K. (Race-day 
registration begins at 6 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Estancia High School, 2323 Placentia Ave., Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, go south on Harbor Boulevard 
and turn right on Adams Avenue. Turn left on Placentia Avenue; the high school 
will be on the right. 
</P>
<P>

TRIED & TRUE; SOARING ON WIND AND WINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, David Haldane is a member of The Times Orange County Edition 
staff. This column is one in an occasional series of first-person accounts of 
leisure activities in and around Orange County. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All my life I've been fascinated by things that go up. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, I used to fly kites off the precipice of a nearby hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I graduated to miniature rockets propelled by fuels that shot them 
aloft, leaving white lines in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, I started playing around with radio-controlled gliders, a skill 
at which I never attained much proficiency. After destroying several planes, in 
fact, I simply lost all confidence and gave it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Which makes it especially curious that now, in my middle and supposedly more 
mature years, I would suddenly develop a fascination for soaring. The sport is 
similar to flying a radio-controlled glider with one important difference: 
Instead of watching the plane from the ground, you ride in the plane. This 
leads to a big distinction in the similarities between the two: Your first 
crash is probably going to be your last. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," my pilot assured me just before takeoff. "The most dangerous 
part is getting here on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. To experience this death-defying act, my girlfriend, Joy, and I had 
spent more than 90 minutes driving out the 91 Freeway to Sailplane Enterprises 
at the Hemet-Ryan Airport in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is rather desolate looking, with portable outhouses and a dusty dirt 
road leading to a steaming hot parking place. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you get there, however, there's a shaded patch of grass sporting 
comfortable benches from which you can watch the action, which generally 
consists of gliders being towed aloft by a single-engine tow plane and, much 
much later, returning alone with only the wind for fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructed of sturdy aluminum, fiberglass and wood, sailplane gliders -- with 
wingspans ranging from 40 to 72 feet -- weigh 250 to 1,000 pounds. Yet carried 
by the wind, they can keep a pilot and up to two passengers aloft from 20 
minutes to several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main objective is entertainment," said Dottie Howell, who owns the 
company with her husband, Larry. "It's for people who want to try something new 
and have a good experience." 
</P>
<P>
 I was more nervous than entertained as I strapped myself tightly into the 
cockpit of the glider that, I'd been told, would shepherd me into the clouds. 
Seated directly behind me was my guardian and mentor, Mike Gunn, a 38-year-old 
trucker from Garden Grove who has been flying gliders for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 At a signal, the tow craft to which we were linked by a 200-foot line began 
slowly rolling down the runway. Piloting expertly from a duplicate set of 
controls in the rear seat, Gunn guided us gently aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience began inauspiciously enough; as the ground sank below us, I 
barely noticed the height to which we were ascending. All around and beneath 
our craft, distant mobile-home parks seemed snuggled securely into the fields 
between the mountains. On a clear day, Gunn told me, you can view a 50-mile 
radius from here -- all the way from Catalina Island to Mt. San Jacinto. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, at about 5,000 feet, the real journey started. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yank the red knob," Gunn instructed, pointing to an object in the middle of 
the instrument panel in front of me. I pulled, and it felt exactly like 
unlatching the hood of a car. There was slight lurch and then the thrill of 
freedom as our glider and the tow plane veered in opposite directions. All I 
could hear was the loud swish of wind over metal as we plummeted through space 
supported only by air. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent a while noticing cumulus clouds as we searched altitude-granting 
updrafts as our altimeter spun. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Gunn did the thing I'd been waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the controls," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 I did. And for the next few minutes I felt like a god, moving the stick 
slightly to the left or right, turning and banking, lifting and rolling, flying 
free as a bird, soaring like a spirit in the uplifting clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're doing fine," Gunn said from behind, patting me reassuringly on both 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he took the plane back, and I knew that the best was to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailing somewhere over the airport, we did a few loops, spins and nose dives 
before pulling up into an intentional stall to feel the thrill of falling free 
through a few hundred feet of open air before swooping back into lift. 
</P>
<P>
 My heart was in my mouth, but my soul was in the sky. And by the time we 
glided in for a smooth landing on the runway we had left 35 minutes before, my 
guts had been completely won over. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell said Sailplane Enterprises -- the closest company of its kind to Orange 
County -- attracts about 100 customers a week willing to pay for first-time 
soaring experiences. Prices, she said, range from $50 for a 20-minute flight 
for one to $250 for an hourlong flight for two. Options include a special 
"acrobatic thrill ride" and hands-on flights like mine. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport has an excellent safety record, she said; in its 22 years of 
operation, the company has never lost a paying passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is probably why Joy decided to accept my invitation for accompaniment on 
a second flight that same afternoon. Our pilot this time was Richard Ensign, 
66, a retired construction worker with 17 years of glider experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you feel about roller-coaster rides?" he gently asked after taking us 
through some preliminary maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 More dips and spins, swoops and stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was all over, Joy admitted to having sweaty hands, but her smile told 
a different story. "It was more exciting than I expected," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me, well, let me just say I'm seriously considering lessons.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't be daunted by the lingo of the horsy set. There are only a few terms 
you'll need to understand to enjoy the weekend's events. (See graphic on page 
11 for illustration of some of the following): 
</P>
<P>
 * ORDER OF GO -- The order in which each horse-and-rider combination jumps the 
course. The order is determined in a drawing before the class, so all riders 
have a chance for a later starting position (advantageous because they can see 
how the course rides for others). 
</P>
<P>
 * THE FIELD -- All the horse-rider combinations entered in the event; for the 
grand prix there are usually 20 to 25. A rider may enter more than one horse. 
</P>
<P>
 * ROUND -- A complete section of rides by the entire field (all entries have 
had their turn on the course). There are generally two rounds in a grand prix 
event, the first round and the jumpoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * CLEAN (or CLEAR) ROUND -- When horse and rider complete all obstacles on the 
course without a fault or penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * FAULTS -- Penalty points incurred on the course for knocking down an 
obstacle or some other infraction. 
</P>
<P>
 * JUMPOFF -- A timed tie-breaker against the clock; generally the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 * DISOBEDIENCE -- A refusal or inability to jump a fence; generally when the 
horse stops before a fence or runs out to the side of it. A penalty results. 
</P>
<P>
 * FENCES -- Generic term for the obstacles a horse jumps. There are many 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 * COMBINATION -- A series of fences set within a stride or two of one another; 
also called a DOUBLE, a TRIPLE or an IN-AND-OUT, depending upon the number of 
elements. If a horse REFUSES (stops at) a fence at any part of the combination, 
the rider must start over from the first fence of the combination. 
</P>
<P>
 * LIVERPOOL -- A water jump with a POLE or RAIL (a wooden bar) over or beyond 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * VERTICAL -- A fence that tests a horse's ability to jump height.  
</P>
<P>
 * OXER -- Two or more vertical jumps placed several feet apart. Oxers test a 
horse's ability to jump height and width, the latter referred to as a SPREAD.  
</P>
<P>
 * GAITS -- The paces at which a horse travels: walk, trot, canter and gallop. 
Show jumping is mainly done at a gallop (fast canter), particularly in the 
jumpoff. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRIDE -- The amount of ground a horse covers in each step. At a canter, the 
average stride is 12 feet. Distances between fences on a grand prix course are 
set accordingly, although some horses will have to adjust their strides. 
</P>
<P>
 * HANDS -- A horse's height, measured in four-inch increments from the ground 
to the top of the horse's withers (the highest point on the back at the base of 
the neck). Show jumpers are generally 16 to 17 hands, although some are a few 
inches shorter or taller. 
</P>
<P>
 * GELDING -- A neutered male horse; STALLIONS are not neutered. A female is a 
MARE. 
</P>
<P>
 * BAY, CHESTNUT, ROAN, BUCKSKIN -- Various colors of horses, most in shades of 
brown, some with black mane and tail. 
</P>
<P>
 * TACK -- The equipment that goes on a horse, such as the saddle and bridle.

A PRIMER TO OAKS CLASSIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 Show-jumping pits horse-and-rider team against series of obstacles and clock. 
Winning team is one with fastest time and fewest penalty points. Typical Course 
</P>
<P>
 Once start bell sounds, round must begin within 30 seconds. Horse should be 
alert and cantering in lively, controlled stride. Obstacles can be as high as 
six feet and as wide as six feet. There may be 12 to 20 obstacles, including 
fences, water ditches, walls and combinations. Course may change between 
rounds. Walking the Course 
</P>
<P>
 Before each round, riders may walk course along line they intend to ride. 
Taking three-foot steps (there are four to average horse's canter) rider 
estimates strides between obstacles and most difficult jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxer: Two or more vertical jumps several feet apart; tests height and width of 
horse's jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Vertical: Tests ability to jump height. 
</P>
<P>
 Water jump: 12- to 14-foot-long shallow ditch filled with water; tests width 
of jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Combination: Series of jumps set within stride or two of each other. Design 
Tricks 
</P>
<P>
 Course-builders set up obstacles to deliberately confuse horse. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 White fence against the background of white judging tent makes horse think 
it's jumping into solid white wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Red obstacle is placed in direct line of sight of red car outside course to 
throw off horse's depth perception. 
</P>
<P>
 If final obstacle faces collecting ring, horse might be too eager to complete 
clean jump. Good Jumping Position 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no grades for style, knowing what gives rider near-perfect 
jumping position adds to aesthetic enjoyment of sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Look straight ahead, between horse's ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Position over horse's center of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintain slight, relaxed contact through reins to horse's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tendon boots, made of sheep-lined leather or synthetic material, are strapped 
to horse's legs to prevent injury from hitting obstacles. Scoring 
</P>
<P>
 Faults (points) are assessed for various infractions on course. Also, there is 
prescribed time limit for each round. Penalty for exceeding time is 1/4 fault 
for each second. Other penalties: 
</P>
<P>
 First refusal: 3 faults 
</P>
<P>
 Second refusal: 6 faults 
</P>
<P>
 Third refusal: Elimination 
</P>
<P>

REWIND: SOARING IN COMPANY OF 'ANGELS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poignant, funny, tragic and deeply meaningful, "Where Angels Fear to Tread" is 
the type of work that warrants repeated viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 This British film, based on E.M. Forster's first novel, is so rich in 
real-life emotion that it's a shame that it went practically unnoticed when it 
was released in the United States in 1992. "Where Angels Fear to Tread" was 
overshadowed by another Forster-based movie of that year, Merchant Ivory's 
acclaimed "Howards End." 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Mirren's Lilia Herriton is at the crux of this resplendent period film. 
After her aristocratic husband dies, the middle-aged Englishwoman embarks on a 
vacation to Italy. This brazen show of independence irks Lilia's mother-in-law 
and sister-in-law, Harriet Herriton. A woman of her position should be home 
mourning in quiet refinement, they believe. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lilia is tired of being under the thumb of her oppressive in-laws. A 
commoner, she married into the English nobility and was often corrected and 
snubbed by the haughty women in the family. When Lilia announces her engagement 
to a 21-year-old Italian man of modest means, the Herritons respond as if the 
entire British Empire is about to collapse. They quickly dispatch son Philip 
(Rupert Graves) to Italy to prevent the marriage. But it's too late: By the 
time he arrives in the picturesque rural town of Monteriano, Lilia and Gino 
(Giovanni Guidelli) have already tied the knot. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy for Lilia is that Gino proves to be as domineering as the 
Herritons. She's very much a kept woman who must also endure his infidelities. 
Sadly, it seems like another cruel twist of fate when Lilia dies while giving 
birth to their first child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where Angels Fear to Tread" derives much of its tension by presenting the 
cultural differences between the passionate Italians and the more studied 
English. To director Charles Sturridge's credit, the viewer is made to 
understand both the positive and negative aspects that make up these two 
disparate cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it is Caroline Abbott (Helena Bonham Carter) -- Lilia's English 
companion -- who sums up the opposing qualities represented by the 
irresponsible, if well-intentioned, Gino and the refined but emotionally cold 
Herritons. In trying to help decide the fate of Lilia and Gino's child, she 
asks Philip, "Do you want the child to be with a father who loves him but will 
bring him up badly or (should he be brought to the Herriton household) where no 
one loves him but he'll be brought up well?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rich with the emotions, inconsistencies and nuances that make up life, "Where 
Angels Fear to Tread" soars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where Angels Fear to Tread" (1991), directed by Charles Sturridge. 112 
minutes. Rated PG. JON MATSUMOTO

KIDS ON FILM: MODERN FAMILIES FIND STONE-AGE 'FLINTSTONES' PREHYSTERIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' Life & Style 
section.

<P>
 In "The Flintstones," well-meaning neanderthal Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) 
is duped by crooks into a bogus promotion at Slate & Co., but his new status 
threatens his longtime friendship with co-worker Barney Rubble, who gets laid 
off. (Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to remember queues this long for any kids' movie since "Aladdin." 
</P>
<P>
 But even with expectations cranked up artificially high from a publicity 
blitz, most kids, especially those who already know and like the cartoon show, 
were not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-year-old Tina Mardirossian said she was expecting a good movie and got 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was great," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The film, which grossed a whopping $37.5 million over the Memorial Day 
weekend, faithfully translates the cartoon show's premise ('50s-style suburban 
family life played out in the year 2 million BC) and builds on them with 
special effects and character actors. You have your dinosaurs and TVs, leopard 
skins and foot-powered cars, your suburban moms who live to shop on credit and 
their henpecked husbands who retreat to the brotherhood of the lodge.  
</P>
<P>
 After the screening, little kids came out mimicking Fred's famous call: 
"Yabba-Dabba Do!" Most cared less about the likable performances by Goodman and 
the other adults, preferring the kids: Fred and Wilma's Pebbles and Barney and 
Betty's Bamm-Bamm.  
</P>
<P>
 Tina said she liked the movie version better "because people looked different 
in it." Clairisa Maygren, 8, agreed: "It was nice because it wasn't a cartoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Some said the movie exceeded their expectations because tepid reviews had 
actually lowered them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people said it was bad," said Molly Stack, 11. But she said she liked it 
anyway, especially the dinosaurs, painted cartoon-like creatures who interacted 
seamlessly with the actors.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lineback, 4, said his favorite part was the pigasaurus, a living garbage 
disposal, who sits under the kitchen sink 24 hours a day.  
</P>
<P>
 Older boys, including 11-year-old Brian Callender, were fascinated with the 
props in the movie. "It was cool," he said, wandering around a model, set in 
the theater lobby, of Barney Rubble's sports coupe, billed as a two-seater with 
two- to four-footpower and manual everything. 
</P>
<P>
 But others were simply mystified as to why the movie is so popular. Erin 
Brown, 8, said she wasn't a fan of the Flintstones in the first place, and it 
was her dad who picked the movie.  
</P>
<P>
 "I expected it to be funny," she said. "I didn't expect it to be like . . . 
this. I thought it was pretty funny in some of the parts. But some of the parts 
just didn't seem . . . modern." 
</P>
<P>
 Like what? 
</P>
<P>
 "Like when Betty and Barney and Bamm-Bamm moved out of the Flintstones' house. 
I didn't understand why they did that. Why didn't they just talk it over?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most of the audible laughter seemed to come from adults, which wasn't 
too surprising given that the verbal humor was geared to them. Playing a 
stereotypical mother-in-law, Elizabeth Taylor criticizes the overweight Fred to 
her daughter Wilma: "What's he ever provided you with except shade?" 
</P>
<P>
 (Some kids said they didn't know who Elizabeth Taylor was.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Erin gave the movie a thumbs down and wouldn't even recommend it 
to her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, laughed all the way through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," said Kimberly Merino, 9. "It was cute."

TRENDY BITS OF ITALY, BRAZIL COME ASHORE AT FASHION ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fashion Island has always had lots of places to eat. Two fairly new additions 
are worth looking at because they signify new dining trends. One is a Brazilian 
cafe; the other is an upscale Italian sandwich emporium. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is a formal restaurant. The Brazilian Tropical Cafe, which opened last 
year in the Atrium Court, is one of the food stalls flanking the Irvine Ranch 
Market. The setup is the same as in almost any shopping mall food court: You 
order from the counter, pick up your food and saunter off to a table in a 
common dining area. 
</P>
<P>
 Not counting Yolie's Brazilian Steakhouse in Irvine, this is the only place in 
Orange County to experience the flavors of Brazil. Of course, there's not 
really much reason to count Yolie's, which has a grilled meat menu that isn't 
specifically Brazilian. And even here at the Brazilian Tropical Cafe, getting 
the flavors of Brazil is a bit problematic, because many dishes seem to have 
been toned down. Luckily, a few are redeemed by lots of flavor and bang for the 
buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the menu is not specifically Brazilian -- crepes, salads, brochettes 
-- but on it you'll see many famous Brazilian dishes, such as feijoada , cozido 
, muqueca and pastel . That means it's no problem at all to eat like a 
Brazilian, as long as you know what to order. You can even drink like a 
Brazilian, by washing the stuff down with a can of Guarana, Brazil's legendary 
soft drink. (It's an acquired taste -- imagine a carbonated, raspberry-flavored 
shampoo.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the pasteles , or turnovers, are deep-fried and probably not as 
healthful as the other dishes served here, they're hard to resist. Try the 
delicious beef pastel with some of the cafe's papaya salsa or the unusual 
pastel stuffed with hearts of palm. 
</P>
<P>
 If you feel like having some soup, you might be tempted by the caldo verde , 
but be strong. It's just an insipid potato puree, with collard greens adding 
color and not much else. Go for the spicy thick black bean soup instead.  
</P>
<P>
 The muqueca, a rich dish of shrimp sauteed in a coconut-chili sauce with green 
pepper, is pretty authentic except for the omission of palm oil ( dende ). On 
the other hand, palm oil, as any cardiologist will tell you, is so high in 
saturated fats as to be off the charts. So count your blessings. 
</P>
<P>
 Crepes come with Brazilian fries (freshly cut and topped with sauteed onions 
and jalapenos) and are meals in themselves. I must say, though, crepe Brazil is 
too salty for my taste. It's filled with slices of the Portuguese sausage known 
as linguica , black beans, onions and rice. 
</P>
<P>
 That same salty sausage is also used to excess in Brazil's national dish, 
feijoada . This is a heavy black bean stew served over rice, alongside little 
piles of collard greens and fried manioc flour ( farofa ), which you mix in as 
garnishes. In a true feijoada completa , though, there would be a wider range 
of meats. 
</P>
<P>
 Better is cozido , a generous stew of white beans, chicken, cabbage, carrots 
and potatoes, though it too suffers from too much salt. Maybe you need all that 
salt in the Brazilian climate. You can do without it in air-conditioned 
Newport. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian Tropical Cafe is inexpensive. Sides are 93 cents to $2.75. Salads 
and entrees are $3.95 to $5.95. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 From Brazil, we move upstairs and across the mall to Italy: Francoli Gourmet 
Emporio, adjacent to I. Magnin. This is a multipurpose store featuring 
hand-painted Italian crockery, fancy glassware, stainless steel dinnerware, 
imported pastas, a fine selection of Italian wines, designer grappas from 
Jacopo Poli and -- the relevant item here -- assorted panini (literally, 
"little breads"), which are Italian sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 The panini phenomenon is just showing up in Orange County, though it's been 
around for years in Los Angeles (where, for instance, chef Celestino Drago 
sells them in a specially designed cafe at the Museum of Contemporary Art). The 
idea is to combine fresh Italian breads such as focaccia or grilled country 
white bread with savory Italian ingredients such as prosciutto, bufala 
mozzarella, grilled eggplant and roasted peppers. The possibilities are 
essentially limitless; they may be made with focaccia, but we're still talking 
about sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Francoli Gourmet Emporio may not be a food stall, but it's not a restaurant 
either. The espresso bar is the only section where you might actually sit and 
eat. You will be served the panini to go, boxed with brochettes of fresh 
seasonal fruits. Most customers take their boxes outside and eat at the 
wrought-iron tables and chairs in a courtyard-like space nearby. It's almost 
like picnicking smack in the middle of a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm already addicted to the panini here. My favorite is the torta di salmone , 
a puffy dome of focaccia draped with smoky salmon and a light schmear of 
mascarpone, then sprinkled liberally with garlic chives, Bermuda onion and 
capers. B. L. T. a la Francoli is also delightful, consisting of air-dried beef 
( bresaola ), romaine, tomatoes and arugula in a homemade Caesar dressing on 
thickly sliced, rosemary-perfumed country bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Panini Caesar uses the same bread and an odd mixture of diced smoked chicken, 
chopped lettuce and Italian parsley with the same pungent Caesar dressing; it's 
a chicken salad sandwich you never imagined, and it grows on you. The simplest 
sandwich has to be the grilled panini di Parma with prosciutto and Fontina 
cheese, which certainly goes the American grilled cheese one better. 
Vegetarians may cotton to the panino Mediterraneo , a medley of marinated 
eggplant, carrot and tomato, crowned by herbed goat cheese.  
</P>
<P>
 Every panino I tasted here was first-rate. As a bonus, Francoli serves one of 
the best, frothiest cappuccinos in town, properly bitter and milky in a giant 
porcelain bowl. There are even various biscotti and Italian chocolates to 
accompany the coffee, and they are fine too. I don't know about anybody else, 
but I think I've found a home for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Francoli Gourmet Emporio is inexpensive to moderate. Panini are $5.50 to 
$6.25. THE BRAZILIAN TROPICAL CAFE

PARKER'S PLACE: LIFE'S A CAMPUS, AND A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently I was on the campus of my alma mater, UC Irvine, as a guest of Thomas 
Keneally and his students in the writing program there. I was somewhat 
flattered that Tom liked my work enough to believe I might have something to 
offer his young writers, though the idea crossed my mind that an enthusiastic 
conversation we had recently about rugby might have paved the way for my 
invite. Mr. Keneally is a sports fan, as am I, and you know how it is when two 
closet jocks get together. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked forward to the day of the campus visit. For one thing, I was curious 
about the MFA Program in Writing, considered by many to be the second best in 
the nation (behind the one at the University of Iowa). I wondered how this 
successful program operated, how the workshops were conducted, what kind of 
students it attracted and how it shaped them. I was also happy to be rubbing 
elbows with college-age people, because I rarely get a chance to do that 
anymore -- haven't, in fact, since I was an undergraduate at UCI back in 
1974-76. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, I anticipated a visit to my old Humanities Office Building haunts, 
the classrooms and lecture halls, the concrete and grass that is the campus. It 
is always interesting -- and sometimes much more than just that -- to go back 
to a place that meant something to you once. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of those spring afternoons too cool for just a shirt and too warm 
for anything else. I found my way to the Humanities parking lot and, all my 
quarters dutifully loaded into the meter, went to find Mr. Keneally and his 
waiting prodigies. 
</P>
<P>
 Few places on Earth strive for an air of permanence more energetically than a 
school of higher learning, yet manage to achieve just the opposite effect. Yes, 
the buildings of the humanities complex were exactly the same as they were 20 
years ago. The landscaping hadn't changed much, if any (as a former member of 
the UCI landscape maintenance crew, I can vouch semi-professionally for this). 
The hallways and floors had the same dull industrial patina they always did. 
Everything smelled the same. I imagine that a great many of the tenured 
teachers there when I was an undergraduate are still there now. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in my mind at least, a college is primarily a channel, and the students 
who fill it are the river. Now, at first glance, the students looked pretty 
much like they did two decades ago. The ethnic ratios may have changed, but the 
sweat shirts and backpacks, the shorts and sandals, the odd air of camaraderie 
and preoccupation would have been recognizable almost any place in the world: 
studentleben.  
</P>
<P>
 But once you dismiss the generalities of appearance and consider the content 
of the campus population, it comes as a minor shock to realize that not one of 
these people was here a few years ago -- let alone 20 years ago -- and, with 
only a fractional exception, will not be here much past the middle of the 
decade. As I blended with the students on the spacious walkways of the campus, 
I had the feeling I was joining a river that was, quite literally, just passing 
through. This is not a bad feeling, but it contradicts the passing scenery -- 
the comforting stasis of the physical, the institutional dependability of 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't remember feeling this way when I attended school here, because I was 
part of the river, being swept along predictable banks and was -- like a lot of 
young people -- too self-absorbed to notice or care that I was just a drop of 
water, rushing by, soon to be gone. What I do remember is lying on the grass in 
Aldrich Park during a searing Santa Ana wind, my brain and body crawling with 
premonitions of life and death, love and work, and the mysterious power of the 
English language I was studying.  
</P>
<P>
 Today I was no longer the river; I was part of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Keneally's students were young, bright and pleasant. Todd is writing a 
novel about a group of friends growing up in Santa Barbara. It has shades of 
Fitzgerald and, as Keneally pointed out, "legs" -- meaning that the tone of the 
prose bears enough weight and promise to carry the writer (and reader) through 
an entire book. Todd's classmates had enough perspicacity to guide him along 
what I thought would be the proper path for the novel, so I said little. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector is writing a novel about Guatemalan refugees living in Los Angeles but 
still locked within the turmoil of their homeland. His narrative was succinct, 
very nicely observed and had the kind of protagonist/antagonist dramatic line 
that people love to read. I didn't have much to offer that his peers did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Keneally conduct a workshop is quite enjoyable. For those who need an 
introduction, he is certainly best known as the author of "Schindler's List," 
though his achievements in writing and life are much broader than one book. 
Those who have spent time with him know him as a superb raconteur, a genially 
outspoken social animal and a man very much engaged with the world around him. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these qualities seem to work for Keneally -- and for his students -- in 
the workshop. He made comments, to be sure, comments born of critical sympathy 
for a young writer's difficult task. Good criticism is important. 
</P>
<P>
 But more importantly he told stories to make his points. Keneally understands 
what all novelists must either develop or be born with: that the novelist's 
first order of business is to tell a convincing story with convincing 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 So, by way of demonstration, Keneally simply does it. At one point he launched 
into a long and highly detailed account of the vengeance one man took against 
another, and by the time he was finished it was clear that Keneally had 
prescribed with a circuitous exactness what Hector needed to do with one aspect 
of his book. Then he was off on another story, then another. It seemed to me 
that Keneally was giving one of the best lessons an experienced writer could 
offer a young, inexperienced one: Life is stories.  
</P>
<P>
 After class I went to the truck and found a parking ticket on the windshield. 
It was only then that I remembered how talented those campus police are, how, 
20 years ago, your car just seemed to sprout those things the second the meter 
clicked off. Another part of the bank, I thought, another nod to the illusion 
of permanence in this great institutional river. It flapped off the window and 
onto the road as I headed home.

3-HOUR TOUR: A DOUBLE DOSE OF AMUSEMENT IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

frequently to The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 One fun zone per neighborhood generally does it, but that's not the case in 
Anaheim. Right next door to Camelot Golfland, for instance -- an arcade castle, 
miniature golf course and water slide -- is Anaheim Family Fun Center, offering 
batting cages, go-carts, roller-skating, bumper boats -- and at least one 
a-mazing activity. 
</P>
<P>
 10 to 11: Want to lose yourself for an hour or so -- literally? Head for the 
Craze Maze ($4) at Anaheim Family Fun Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Then try to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 A score card is marked with the letters M-A-Z-E and numbers 1 through 8. 
Simply punch in your start time; find your way to the top of towers designated 
M, A, Z and E; punch out the corresponding letters on the card; punch out the 
numbers, located throughout the maze; and find the exit. Punch-holes are shaped 
like the letters and numbers -- a Z-shaped punch for the Z, and so on -- so you 
can't cheat. And try to resist sneaking under the partitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on your mind-set, finding yourself back at the starting point within 
moments can elicit amusement, despair, or both. I was positively jubilant upon 
finally reaching what I thought was my first destination, only to be greeted by 
the sign "Sorry, no punch in this tower." 
</P>
<P>
 The secret: Just keep moving, and if you ever hit a tower, fine. A bench and a 
water faucet are wisely provided at the center of the maze, and if you ever 
really get desperate, there are escape routes to the perimeter. The pattern 
changes monthly. For a group, it's a blast; solo, it's a foray into fortitude, 
frustration and claustrophobic folly.  
</P>
<P>
 11 to 11:10: "Load one ball at a time and fire away!" were the verbal 
instructions dockside at Battle Boats ($3.75). The boats run on real engines, 
your bottom gets realistically wet, and you can practically smell gunpowder 
when the cannons shoot. Among posted signs: "Do not open turrets in battle 
area." "Do not get out of boat in battle area." "Do not shoot at dock." 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have the mettle, or your sea legs, get a Rambo bucket of balls 
and shoot from outside the battle area; targets include a bomb, helicopter, 
parachute and . . . ducks.  
</P>
<P>
 11:10 to 11:20: Once inside Camelot's castle walls, where pizza and other 
snacks are available, pass on the usual "Total Carnage"-type games in the 
arcade and peek into video future with the truly impressive "Time Traveler 
Hologram" (25 cents). "To save the universe," explained an attractive (if 
necessarily small) female hologram, "navigate the strings of time to the year 
2552. Your quest begins in 1873." You are a cowboy hero. "If you die, use the 
cube to reverse time and escape death. Travel through time. . . . You are our 
last hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Who could resist that entreaty? Not me, and apparently, I saved the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 11:20 to noon: The miniature-golf area can count itself among the more 
colorful such courses ($4.75; children 5 to 11, $3.50). It's watched over by 
pink, yellow and green dragons and armored knights, and it's eclectic if not 
exactly encyclopedic in its architectural scope: Sure, the ubiquitous miniature 
golf windmill shows up, but holes also variously incorporate a five-tier 
Japanese pagoda, a pastel-pretty Victorian manse and an imposing 
California-style mission. It's worth a look even if you don't play a round. As 
in real golf, water can be a hazard. Unlike real golf, if you're on the green, 
you're off the course.  
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: The water slide costs $3 for 10 rides, $5 for 20 rides or $7 for an 
all-day pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Ascend an eight-flight stair tower, descend via giant tubes resembling a pair 
of semi-coiled double helixes, splash down in a small pool and ascend again. 
Water slide rules: You must be 42 inches tall if you can swim, 52 inches if you 
can't. Everyone must shower before riding the slide. Bathing suits are 
required. Absolutely no horseplay allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 No horseplay?  
</P>
<P>
 In that case, if you're ages 2 to 11, upstairs in the west wing of the castle 
($3 an hour) await the Galaxy Blaster, Air Bounce, Foam Forest and Horizontal 
Heckler. Parents can leave or stay and, said group activities manager Linda 
Hokanson, "horsing around is encouraged."

 BRONZE HEROES: Tom Gillenwater, 67, of Huntington Beach says of his work 
casting art in bronze (OC Live!, Page 8): "I'm not an expert; that's my first 
disclaimer." . . . Oh really? Last weekend he was awarded the prestigious 
Phippen Award at the 20th annual Phippen Western Art Show in Prescott, Ariz. . 
. . It goes for the work that "best exemplifies the spirit of the West." The 
piece shows a western grandpa with his two granddaughters. "It was a tribute to 
my own granddaughters," he says.

 IS SHE PERFECT? They may not know much about Clara Barton in Egypt, but the 
local American Red Cross says Jehan Sadat has a lot in common with the nursing 
pioneer. . . . Sadat, widow of slain former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, has 
been an outspoken leader of feminist causes there. She'll speak on June 21 at 
the Red Cross's Clara Barton awards luncheon to honor local women of 
achievement. . . . Says its spokeswoman Judy Iannaccone: "Her dedication to the 
advancement of women makes Mrs. Sadat a perfect speaker for this event."

 INDOOR SURFING: The promotion for "Endless Summer II" may seem to be endless, 
but here's one where you can touch the real thing. Robert Weaver and Pat 
O'Connell, co-stars of the big screen surfing sequel, which opens Friday, will 
be at Planet Hollywood in Santa Ana today to donate two of the surfboards they 
used in the movie. . . . The boards will join other movie memorabilia there, 
such as some Dorothy shoes from the Wizard of Oz and Terminator's armor.

HOSPITAL BEEFS UP SECURITY MEASURES; SAFETY: COUNTY-USC ADDED MORE GUARDS AND 
RESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE FACILITY AFTER A SHOOTING LEFT THREE DOCTORS WOUNDED. 
MAN CONVICTED OF THE RAMPAGE IS SENTENCED TO THREE LIFE TERMS. 
</P>

 Roberto Contreras had walked two blocks from his car Wednesday to the gate 
leading to the emergency room at County-USC Medical Center, but as he tried to 
enter, a security guard blocked his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just dropped off my friend here," Contreras said in frustration as the 
guard instructed him he would have to walk farther -- up a hill, around a 
corner and up another winding block to the hospital's main entrance, one of 
only two open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 When Contreras arrived at the right door, the 30-year-old construction worker 
was greeted by other security officers who questioned him about where he was 
going and why. 
</P>
<P>
 The tight safeguards were put in place in the 16 months since a Feb. 8, 1993, 
shooting rampage in the facility's emergency waiting room that left three 
physicians wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the convicted gunman, Damascio Ybarra Torres, 41, was sentenced 
to three life terms plus 12 years for the shootings and for taking two hospital 
workers hostage in a five-hour standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge John H. Reid, in handing down the stiff sentence, noted 
that Torres was "driven by the compulsion or belief" that County-USC personnel 
had used him as a guinea pig in AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the judge told Torres, his delusion did not excuse his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid ordered Torres to serve two of the life sentences consecutively, which 
means that he will likely die in prison, according to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of the sentence drew mixed comments from County-USC workers, some of 
whom told reporters after the shooting that they had feared that violence would 
erupt in the often-understaffed emergency waiting room -- one of the busiest in 
the country -- where frustrations and tempers often flared. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres "got what he deserved," said Dr. James Lee, a County-USC resident who 
has worked off and on in the hospital's emergency room. "It sends a message to 
others that this sort of thing will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the wounded physicians, Dr. Glen Rogers, was surprised at the harshness 
of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow! I guess it sounds a little bit rough to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who spent any amount of time around Torres realizes that he's not in 
control of his actions in the same way that you and I are in control of our 
actions. . . . I frankly don't have any ill will toward Torres. He's clearly 
got psychiatric problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The two other wounded men, Dr. Richard May and Dr. Paul Kaszubowski, could not 
be reached for comment. Both testified during Torres' trial that they are no 
longer able to practice medicine as a result of their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, against the advice of his lawyer, Torres boldly took the 
witness stand and admitted to meticulously planning the shooting, then arming 
himself with three guns and a hunting knife and carrying it out. 
</P>
<P>
 He justified his actions by saying that he acted in self defense after doctors 
at the hospital injected him with a yellow substance that he said causes the 
deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 When he went to the hospital on several occasions to be treated for resulting 
illnesses, he said, emergency room doctors referred him to the mental ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses to the shooting testified at Torres' trial that they heard Torres 
shouting, "I don't want nurses! I want doctors! I want white coats!" 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated only five hours before finding Torres guilty on all 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 As he had throughout his trial, Torres on Wednesday repeatedly asked Reid to 
dismiss his lawyer, saying she had failed to call as witnesses three County-USC 
researchers that Torres believes were conducting the AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
 He also criticized his lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Joan Croker, for not 
backing his claim of self defense. Croker had attempted to enter an insanity 
plea for Torres before the trial but he would not allow it. She has said she 
does not believe the researchers exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, noting that there had been no evidence of improper conduct on the 
part of anyone at the hospital or Croker, denied Torres' request. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Ingalls, said after the sentencing 
that there is no evidence Torres has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 At County-USC Wednesday, Lee and others said the increased security at the 
facility made them feel safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the difference," Lee said. "Even the hallways are more orderly." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital spokeswoman Adelaida de la Cerda said she had heard similar comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking through the corridors near the emergency room, she pointed out 
uniformed county safety police posted every few yards, including one who is 
stationed inside the waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
 Also stationed there, De La Cerda said, is a hospital ombudsman, whose job it 
is to calm down agitated patients and to spot trouble brewing. Hospital workers 
and waiting patients are now separated by a wall with bulletproof windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Private guards wearing blazers and slacks and carrying hand-held metal 
detectors are now stationed at every door with instructions not to let anyone 
in who does not have legitimate business at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 77 safety police officers assigned to the hospital before the 
shooting; now there are 129, De La Cerda said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no private security force; now there are 109 guards, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that all hospital workers have been trained to spot people who might 
cause trouble and visiting hours have been changed from almost unlimited to 
restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had an incident since the shooting," De La Cerda said, "and God 
willing, we won't ever again." 
</P>

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; CANDIOTTI HAS A PAIN IN THE NECK

 Tom Candiotti was examined Wednesday by Robert Watkins for a neck pain he has 
had the last month and learned he has inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't affect my arm strength, but it did affect how I was throwing 
before, when I wasn't getting my arm up.And Ron (Perranoski) saw that and we 
made some adjustments," said Candiotti, who is being treated. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might have noticed my grimacing out there on the mound, because it makes 
it uncomfortable to keep my arm up. It's easier to not come over the top. But I 
haven't wanted to use that as an excuse for the last couple of times I have 
pitched, and it's not bad enough for me to miss a start." 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti has given up 16 hits and 11 runs, 10 earned, in 14 1/3 innings over 
his last two starts.

 Today's schedule (at the Racquet Centre, Studio City, 2 p.m.): Singles -- 
Dylan Mann, Woodland Hills Taft, vs. Robert Williams, Dorsey. Doubles -- Oliver 
Catlin-Jeff Manson, Palisades, vs.Jason Ebin-Daniel Elperin, Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's champions: Singles -- Rafael Huerta, Chatsworth. Doubles -- 
Catlin-Manson, Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Catlin and Manson, Palisades' No. 1 doubles team and last year's City 
champions, face an unexpected opponent today in Palisades' No. 2 doubles team, 
Ebin and Elperin. Bud Kling, Palisades' coach for 16 years, said both teams are 
talented. "Catlin and Manson play better against opponents from other teams, 
but play less well against Ebin and Elperin," Kling said. "I think they're 
even." The singles final matches two sophomores in Mann and Williams. Williams 
defeated Mann in a tournament earlier this year and is top-seeded. GREG

THOROUGHBRED RACING; BELMONT DUEL WOULD BE FITTING AFTER ZITO'S GESTURE TO 
LUKAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 How fitting that Tabasco Cat, trained by Wayne Lukas, and Go For Gin, trained 
by Nick Zito, finished 1-2 in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 How fitting that the two colts will race in the Triple Crown rubber match, the 
Belmont Stakes, in New York on June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first card that Jeff got from a horseman came from Nick Zito," Linda 
Lukas said. Jeff, Linda's husband and Wayne's son, was the stable's chief 
assistant trainer before he was seriously injured in December after Tabasco Cat 
broke loose from his handlers in the Santa Anita barn area. Trying to stop the 
runaway, Jeff was knocked to the hard ground and suffered multiple skull 
fractures. He didn't see Zito's card until he emerged from a coma early this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real sweet of Nick to send that card," Linda added. "And it looked 
like it was all him, too. I don't think his wife did all the work for him. That 
made it extra special." 
</P>
<P>
 That was a correct assumption: Zito and his wife are no longer together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can relate to what happened to Jeff," Zito said. "Several years ago, a 
filly bit me in the face. . . . She came within a half-inch of getting me in 
the eye. I was told that I probably would have been blinded if she had been a 
half-inch the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Zito has a two-inch horizontal scar under his right eye. He got to 
know Jeff Lukas better than he knew many New York trainers because the younger 
Lukas had horses stabled across the street from Zito's barn when Jeff was 
running his father's Belmont Park division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne's barn at Belmont has the best grazing area at the track," Zito said 
before leaving Pimlico. "I'm going to send Go For Gin over there to get him 
ready for the Belmont." 
</P>
<P>
 Zito didn't act as though he was kidding. He's a loose guy, about as loose a 
big-time trainer as you'll find, but he seems to be the "kiddee" more than the 
kidder most of the time.  
</P>
<P>
 At a fancy Baltimore hotel, after Go For Gin had won the Kentucky Derby and a 
couple of days before the Preakness, the colt's owners were attending a 
black-tie dinner dance, while their trainer, dressed in dungarees and a worn 
blue jacket, waited for a friend out front near the valet parking stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "That stuff's for the owners," the Queens-born Zito said, pointing toward the 
ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Seigenfeld, director of Triple Crown Productions, was in a tuxedo as he got 
out of his car. He reached into his pocket, fished out a five-dollar bill and 
handed it to Zito. The trainer laughed as hard as the straight-faced 
Seigenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what this horse does, you won't see me changing," Zito said. "I 
didn't change after Strike The Gold won the Derby, either." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the subtle differences between the first two Triple Crown races is that 
there are no secrets at the Preakness. At Churchill Downs, the horses are 
scattered throughout several barns, which gives the trainers a chance to hide 
despite the media hordes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Preakness, they're in the goldfish bowl upon arrival. Virtually all of 
the horses are stabled in a row at the same barn, stall after stall after 
stall, and reporters prowl up and down an asphalt walkway that separates the 
barn from a grazing area. The Preakness barn is also only a few steps from the 
press parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 So the trainers sometimes have to use guile to see who's paying attention. For 
a few days during Preakness week, Buddy, Wayne Lukas' 21-year-old stable pony, 
was living in the stall that had Tabasco Cat's name on it. The future Preakness 
winner was in another stall. When the first of several tour groups began 
trickling through, Lukas correctly identified Buddy, but the next day he did 
nothing to discourage the visitors from thinking they were looking at the real 
Tabasco Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Lukas," one of them said, "could I get over there (to the stall) and have 
my picture taken with your horse?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, go ahead," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Click. The visitor got his picture taken with Buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Lukas," another tour member said, "can I go over and pet your horse?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, go ahead," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the second visitor walked over and stroked Buddy's head. 
</P>
<P>
 By Preakness day, Lukas had lost count of the people who had had their 
pictures taken with Buddy. They might have noticed the difference when they 
compared the developed film with pictures of Tabasco Cat winning the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy has been ponying for the Lukas outfit for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's never had a day off," Lukas said. "A few years ago, we figured that he 
had had enough and sent him to the farm. He stood by the gate, waiting for 
somebody to take him back to the track. He was starving himself to death. There 
was grass up to his ankles, and he wouldn't touch it. He didn't start eating 
regular again until he we brought him back to the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy will play an important role later this year, perhaps during the Del Mar 
season that begins in late July. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be the first horse Jeff uses when he gets back," Wayne Lukas said. 
"He'll be the perfect horse for that. (Trainer) Jack Van Berg's been on him and 
couldn't get over how good he is. He's the best pony I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Jimmy Croll doesn't really want to run Holy Bull in the Belmont 
Stakes, but the horse's sharp performance in the Metropolitan Mile Handicap 
Monday at Belmont is tempting him to do so. Holy Bull loves the track, and 
speed horses are dangerous in the Belmont Stakes, despite the 1 1/2-mile 
distance. The drawbacks: The Belmont comes less than two weeks after the 
Metropolitan, and there will be some quality speed -- Go For Gin and Tabasco 
Cat -- to keep Holy Bull busy. After favored Holy Bull broke badly and finished 
seventh in the Kentucky Derby, Croll ruled out the Preakness and the Belmont. 
The redemption plan was a campaign that might lead to the Travers Stakes at 
Saratoga in August. "Now I'm in trouble," Croll said after Holy Bull's 5 
1/2-length victory in 1:33 4/5. "I'll take a few days to weigh the variables. 
I've got to handicap the rest of the horses. The way he ran, (the Belmont) will 
take a lot of thinking." Croll isn't concerned about consulting an owner. The 
trainer is also the owner of Holy Bull.

MALIBU IS NOT LIABLE FOR ROAD, JUDGE RULES; LITIGATION: RAMBLA PACIFICO IS 
DEEMED COUNTY'S RESPONSIBILITY. ACTION MEANS CITY WON'T BE A PARTY TO 
$6-MILLION SUIT BY 6 LANDOWNERS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES IN FIRESTORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ruled that Rambla Pacifico Road is the county's 
responsibility, upholding for a second time this year Malibu's use of an 
obscure law to exclude the calamitous road from its city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling means that the city will not be a party in the lawsuit filed by six 
Las Flores Canyon landowners who lost their homes in the Nov. 2 firestorm last 
year and are seeking more than $6 million, which they claim was the value of 
their property before the fire. They are also seeking money for emotional 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed in August, 1992, landowners blamed both the city and the 
county for their loss, arguing that the closure of Rambla Pacifico, which was 
destroyed by a 1984 landslide, blocked access to their houses during the fires 
and exacerbated ensuing floods and mudflows. 
</P>
<P>
 The city maintained that the street was not under its jurisdiction. State law 
says that newly incorporated towns can choose not to accept responsibility for 
certain streets. When Malibu was incorporated, it chose not to include Rambla 
Pacifico, says City Attorney Christi Hogin. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling last week, Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber exempted the city 
of Malibu from liability, ruling that the county has always been and continues 
to be responsible for the dilapidated road. No trial date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is going to have to face a legal trial on the same basis that they 
lost in an earlier (lawsuit)," said Richard D. Norton, the attorney 
representing the property owners. "We will be asking for fair market value for 
the properties before they were damaged and for damages in emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision followed the lines of an earlier ruling in a 1989 claim filed 
against the city and county by a group of homeowners who were seeking to force 
the two government entities to rebuild the road. 
</P>
<P>
 After the city was excused from that action, the county denied liability in 
the case, which is scheduled to go to trial in July. County attorneys argued 
that rebuilding the road would be too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted with the (latest) ruling," said Steven H. Kaufmann, an 
attorney who represents Malibu in both lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city doesn't believe it was a proper party in either of the cases and all 
the problems predated the formation of the city. Nonetheless, the city is going 
ahead with its application to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and to 
the state Office of Emergency Services" for funds to repair the road and 
buttress the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the city and county jointly applied for about $11 million 
in state and federal funds to correct flooding problems in Las Flores Canyon 
and to stop the landslide from causing further damage in lower Las Flores 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The city called for federal acquisition of nine or 10 Las Flores Canyon 
properties, all of which are located in the lower canyon. A colossal dirt 
buttress would have been placed there to stop the slide. 
</P>
<P>
 But after complaints about the proposed acquisition from three Las Flores 
Canyon property owners who said they wanted to rebuild their burned properties, 
the City Council directed Public Works Director John P. Clement to design yet 
another plan that would spare the properties and still block the landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining six property owners don't want to rebuild because they believe 
it is too dangerous to live in the canyon, Norton said.

CITY HALL NEWS; IRWINDALE; DEVELOPER PROPOSES MOTOR RACEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Developers who want to build a raceway next to the L.A. International 
Marketplace said they are optimistic about their chances after the Irwindale 
City Council's initial response. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed raceway would include a 3/8-mile oval track, a 6,500-seat 
stadium, and would cost about $3 million to build, said Dennis Constanzo of Oak 
Knoll Group, a Los Angeles development firm that is jointly planning the 
raceway with NuWay Industries, the company that built the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The group went before the City Council May 26 to get council members' views on 
the project, Constanzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to find out from the City Council if they are diametrically opposed 
to the plan," he said. "The City Council said: 'Go through the (city's 
administrative) process. If it's a good project, it's a good project and if 
not, we'll find out.' Frankly, we find that encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Constanzo said they will follow the Planning Department's instructions on the 
project, paying particular attention to city noise ordinances, which he said 
are the biggest obstacle to approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real key to the project is sound," he said. "It's very important to 
understand we are not asking for a special dispensation. We will live under the 
existing noise ordinance. We will get our sound to that level or below." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, the track would require effective mufflers on stock cars, midget 
cars, motorcycles and go-carts, and monitor the sound levels at every race or 
practice session. They would construct the track with clay instead of asphalt, 
lower it slightly and build solid stadium walls to prevent noise dispersion. 
</P>
<P>
 Constanzo said that with these precautions, raceway noise in the nearest 
residential area -- about one-quarter to one-third of a mile from the track -- 
would probably be below the level of street traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans will take three to six months to complete, Constanzo said, and if 
they are approved, construction would take an additional year. With 70 racing 
days a year, the raceway would bring $200,000 to $250,000 in annual revenues to 
the city, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from the marketplace has been $28,000 to $32,000 quarterly in the 10 
months since it opened, said City Treasurer Abe De Dios, about a third of what 
was expected. But he said he could not speculate on what income a raceway would 
yield. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwindale's mayor and City Council members did not return phone calls 
regarding the raceway.

<P>
 BALDWIN PARK: The City Council reviewed a proposed ordinance that would impose 
stricter controls on hotel and motel operators in order to prevent drug dealing 
and prostitution on their premises. The ordinance would mandate that all 
customers show legal identification when renting a room and that hotels have 
standardized registration cards and maintain records for five years. The law 
would allow impromptu inspections by law enforcement or city officials. The 
council will vote June 15 on the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAREMONT: In a 5-0 vote, the City Council tentatively approved an ordinance 
prohibiting tattoo parlors from operating in the city, explaining that they 
represent an unregulated health concern. There will be a public hearing June 
14, at which time the council will hold a second reading and decide whether to 
approve, amend or deny the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 LA PUENTE: The City Council voted to change the 1996 municipal election date 
from April, 1996, to March, 1997. The council decided to change the date after 
county officials informed La Puente that the original date was too close to the 
1996 primaries, scheduled for March, 1996, and that the county would be unable 
to provide support services for both elections. The new date will extend the 
terms of council members seeking reelection by 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE: The Public Safety Commission has recommended that the 
City Council approve a public safety budget for the fiscal year beginning July 
1 that includes an additional $48,000 for a contingency overtime officer. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: The city is one of 30 finalists for an All-American City Award, a 
program of the National Civic League. Monrovia was chosen for its program of 
citizen participation, a successful community policing program in which 
officers work with local churches and social services, and a weekly merchants 
festival that helped revitalize the downtown area. A delegation of city leaders 
and officials will travel to Oakland on June 9 in hopes of clinching the 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: The City Council has hired an independent legal counsel to defend 
its code of conduct ordinance, which Councilman Isaac Richard and the American 
Civil Liberties Union say violates the 1st Amendment. After a closed-door 
session Saturday, the council announced it had retained Pierce O'Donnell. The 
ACLU filed a lawsuit last week challenging the 1992 ordinance governing council 
members' behavior and asking the council to repeal it.

 Torrance Councilman George Nakano already has the backing of the Sierra Club 
and the California League of Conservation Voters in his race to beat state Sen. 
Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) in a district that includes Venice and nearby 
areas of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 But the help of such groups only goes so far. So last week he held a campaign 
event to announce backing from an environmentally conscious movie actor, Ed 
Begley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Begley, a member of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's environmental 
commission, rode Torrance's electric bus and showed off his own battery-powered 
Volkswagen Rabbit. The event was intended to underscore Nakano's support for 
electric cars and clean-fuel technology. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nakano is hardly the only eco-minded candidate. Dills and another 
challenger, Venice attorney Mike Sidley, have said they would also push for the 
creation of "green technologies."

 MISCIKOWSKI IS MISSING: What's going on in Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin 
Braude's office? In recent days, Braude has learned that he's losing two 
longtime aides, Cindy Miscikowski, his chief deputy and principal planning 
aide, and Rosalind Wayman, the head of his Valley office.  
</P>
<P>
 Miscikowski's departure has provided grist for some weighty political 
conjecture around City Hall. Much discussed is whether Miscikowski, the wife of 
lobbyist-attorney and real estate heir Doug Ring, will run against Braude, much 
as onetime aide Laura Chick did against Joy Picus. 
</P>
<P>
 Picus cried foul throughout their 1992 City Council race, likening Chick to a 
trusted employee who steals trade secrets and then sets up a competing 
business. Despite it all, Chick won. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Miscikowski says she has no plans to run for Braude's seat. 
Instead, she's headed for the job of executive director of the Hebrew Union 
College's Skirball Cultural Center. The center, which includes a museum 
featuring the works of Jewish artists, is scheduled to open next year at a 
prime location overlooking the Sepulveda Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really time for a change," she said, "a time to see if there's life 
outside City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Miscikowski, a Brentwood resident like Braude, has long been considered 
a prime candidate for the seat Braude has held since 1965, and many observers 
find it hard to believe she will not seek election someday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Barr, Braude's press deputy, said recently that Braude has not ruled out 
the possibility of running again in 1997. Others wonder if the 73-year-old 
anti-smoking crusader, whose office has been essentially run for years by 
Miscikowski, will want to hang on if he must attend more closely to the affairs 
of office.

 TRY INHALING THIS ONE: Doing their civic duty in the newly formed Carthay 
Square neighborhood patrol, two residents spotted a suspicious-looking vehicle 
parked with its motor running outside a house that neighbors have long thought 
to be a den of iniquity. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a note in their patrol log, they were about to call in a report to the 
base station -- "Drug deal going down!" -- when a figure scurried out of the 
darkness and slid behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a pizza delivery man.

PARK PATROL; CRIME: COUNCIL OKS TEST PROGRAM TO ALLOCATE MORE OFFICERS TO FIGHT 
DRUG DEALING AND RELATED CRIME IN DOWNTOWN AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council approved a six-month pilot program Tuesday that 
will add the equivalent of seven full-time police officers to Palisades Park, 
the Third Street Promenade and other parts of downtown to combat drug dealing 
and related crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The program -- which will cost $575,700, nearly all of it for salaries -- will 
be staffed by regular police officers working overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 It was approved on a 5-2 vote, representing a victory for City Councilman 
Kelly Olsen, who has hammered away at the problem of drug dealing in Palisades 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has not abated despite repeated police sting operations at the 
park. At Tuesday's council meeting, Olsen said that in December he saw 
Palisades Park dealers openly peddling drugs to people who had driven by to see 
the Nativity scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This got my blood boiling," Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen had originally proposed foot patrols in the park, an option that was 
rejected by the rest of the council a month ago. Instead, they asked the police 
chief to devise his own plan. It was that blueprint -- a combination of foot 
and bike patrols -- that won the council's approval Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some cancer in the city and the cancer must be dealt with," 
Councilman Paul Rosenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Abdo and Mayor Pro Tem Tony Vazquez dissented because they said 
they were not convinced the extra officers were needed. Although Police Chief 
James T. Butts argued otherwise, they also worried that the new deployment 
would take police from other neighborhoods, where, they said, crime will now go 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who are afraid (crime) is going to move to their neighborhood, 
this is not comforting," Abdo said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to approving the pilot program for downtown -- the area between 
Pico and Wilshire boulevards, the ocean and 4th Street -- the council also 
acted to quell public safety concerns about the Third Street Promenade.  
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the Bayside District Corp., which runs the successful 
entertainment area, the council appropriated $146,000 to place a police 
community service officer in a kiosk in the middle of the promenade.  
</P>
<P>
 The council, however, rejected a plan to hire "hosts" who would walk the 
promenade and advise visitors that they don't have to give money to 
panhandlers. Although Bayside officials presented the idea as an education 
program, some council members objected, saying the city shouldn't have to pay 
for what amounted to a private security force. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing last week, promenade officials and merchants made a strong case 
for more police protection -- which was a surprise because they are usually 
circumspect about voicing public safety concerns for fear of scaring customers 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a serious problem in your downtown," Bayside District President 
Robert Resnick said. "People don't feel safe. . . . We have merchants who can't 
open their stores in the morning because they're being cornered." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants and officials warned the council that they were jeopardizing a cash 
cow that provides $8 million a year in tax revenues to the city. They offered a 
packet of letters filled with horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter from the public relations firm of Casey & Sayre said that half of its 
14 employees have had their cars stolen or broken into in the year they have 
had offices on the promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Butts said crime at the promenade -- especially car thefts and break-ins -- is 
related to the drug problem in the park. So is some of the aggressive 
panhandling. In both cases, drug users are committing crimes to raise money to 
buy crack cocaine -- the drug of choice at Palisades Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief said the pilot program will actually increase protection in other 
areas of the city because officers assigned there will no longer be pulled 
downtown whenever extra police are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Butts also asked for new or amended laws to regulate use of the beach parking 
lots and promenade parking structures. Merchants reported that their employees 
come to work and find transients sleeping in the elevators and stairwells of 
the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Atty. Marsha Jones Moutrie said the request was tricky because 
anti-loitering laws are unconstitutional. Some council members also expressed 
reservations.

STINGING ACCUSATIONS MARK RACE FOR CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Attack, counterattack, attack. Upstart challenger Valerie Romero is continuing 
her brutal assault on Rep. Jay Kim (R-Diamond Bar) for alleged violations of 
federal election laws as Tuesday's primary nears. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's first mailer told voters they had been "betrayed" by Kim. The 
congressman struck back with his "lies, lies, lies" mailer, accusing Romero of 
misrepresenting his legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Romero has answered with "The Two Faces of Congressman Jay Kim." The 
mailer notes that Kim campaigned two years ago as a reform candidate. Since 
then, the FBI has seized campaign records from Kim, who is the target of a 
federal probe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I got into the race, and the most important thing, is integrity," 
Romero said in an interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim did not return calls, but Romero said she expects his campaign to fire 
another volley. The congressman has plenty of money to engage his best-financed 
and most-combative challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has raised $224,260 since the start of the year, nearly four times as much 
as Romero, according to finance disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero has raised $61,343 for her congressional bid. But she has been willing 
to go into debt with personal loans totaling $70,000 to give her campaign a 
boost, according to finance disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a couple of months ago, Romero, 30, was a political nobody. But she has 
emerged as the strongest of Kim's four challengers with her stinging campaign. 
Romero has benefited from the help of her father, Richard (Dick) Romero, who 
owns a string of auto dealerships and is a local Republican fund-raiser who 
helped raise money for her candidacy. Romero is a vice president in her 
father's business. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Republican challengers are Bob Kerns, Ronald L. Curtis and Todd 
Thakar. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban redeveloper Ed Tessier and attorney Richard L. Waldron are running in 
the Democratic primary.  
</P>
<P>
 But because of voter registration -- 48% Republican to 40% Democrat -- Kim is 
expected to survive the general election if he wins the primary. That is, 
depending on the course of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Kim became the target of the federal probe into possible 
election, tax and labor law violations after The Times reported that he used 
about $480,000 from his engineering corporation to finance his 1992 campaign 
despite federal prohibitions. Kim has said that at most he is guilty of 
technical violations and that he, in effect, was using his own money. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41st District includes areas of Diamond Bar, Pomona, Walnut and Rowland 
Heights as well as parts of Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the 31st District, Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park) is 
facing a primary challenge from lawyer Bonifacio (Bonny) Garcia and two other 
candidates, Maria Escalante and David Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia is taking his second shot at the seven-term incumbent, who won two 
years ago with 57% of the vote, compared with Garcia's 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two issues in this campaign: What has the incumbent done and what 
am I going to do," said Garcia, 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez did not return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia is going for the jugular, hitting hard on Martinez's seemingly 
inconsistent stance on regulating firearms, his recent positions on local 
Latino issues and his overall performance in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty has strongly opposed the regulation of guns," Garcia said in a recent 
interview. "He voted against the Brady bill . . . and now, with me breathing 
down his neck, he votes for the ban on semiautomatic weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was one of the Democrats who switched votes last month to pass the 
Clinton Administration's ban on the sale of certain semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia takes a hard-line approach. He said the use of firearms needs to be 
regulated like driving a car. He is running cable television ads, touting that 
position in a district that is plagued by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia also attacks Martinez for failing to support Latinos in the 
predominantly Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, for example, Martinez wrote to Bell Gardens voters urging them not to 
recall several white council members who had been criticized as insensitive to 
Latinos in the heavily Latino city. The recall was successful, resulting in the 
first Latino-majority council in the history of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy has been on the wrong side on every Latino issue over the last four 
years," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the issue of Martinez's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's campaign distributed to 50,000 homes a brochure featuring a reprint 
of a 1993 Buzz magazine story labeling Martinez "one of the dumbest congressmen 
in Washington" and one of Los Angeles' eight worst politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The article quotes a former aide, who says pro-choice Martinez voted against 
spending Medicaid funds for abortions for victims of rape and incest because he 
wasn't paying attention. Martinez voted the wrong way when he blindly followed 
the direction of a nearby congressman, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who is running a low-key campaign, recently sent out a mailer in an 
attempt to defuse the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is always difficult for any person who holds public office to defend 
himself from attack," said Martinez, who reported raising $42,110 this year for 
his campaign and has $69,369 on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand," he said, "his or her opponent is someone who, in most 
cases, has not held public office and therefore has a distinct advantage -- he 
or she has no record to attack and has displeased no one. He can make promises 
of great reforms . . . and so it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who has spent $62,000 on his campaign, is an activist who has helped 
Spanish-speaking parents in El Monte when they were unhappy with the school 
board over the firing of a Latino superintendent. He also has helped raise 
money to improve a Watts-area Catholic school. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said that, if elected, he will concentrate on programs to increase 
education and employment in the recession-ravaged district.  
</P>
<P>
 He proposed establishing a federal economic disaster relief agency, which 
would come into regions where unemployment exceeds 7%. The agency would be 
similar to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which doled out millions of 
dollars in grants and loans after the recent Southern California fires and 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government should be committed to full employment," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to pundits, Martinez probably will be able to weather the 
attacks from Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez has the name recognition of a longtime incumbent. And his office also 
has a reputation for assisting constituents with routine concerns. In addition, 
Garcia is likely to lose some votes because of his position on one key issue -- 
abortion. He opposes it; Martinez supports abortion rights. Democrats generally 
are pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31st District includes all or part of Alhambra, Azusa, Baldwin Park, El 
Monte, South El Monte, Glendora, Industry, Irwindale, Monterey Park, Rosemead, 
San Gabriel, South San Gabriel, East San Gabriel, Temple City, West Covina, 
East Los Angeles and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 27th District, Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead, (R-Glendale), the dean of 
California's GOP congressional delegation, is seeking his 12th term. He faces 
poorly funded Elizabeth Michael, a former candidate for state Assembly, in the 
Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic primary pits Doug Kahn, an Altadena print shop owner, against 
Daniel I. Hurst, a Burbank systems analyst, and Roger Kulpa, an accounting firm 
owner from Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn, who is expected to win the Democratic primary, could give Moorhead a 
strong challenge in November. He received 40% of the vote in 1992 against the 
congressman. And the 27th District, which stretches from San Marino to Tujunga, 
has become more Democratic since reapportionment in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 American Independent Party member Billy Gibbs of Glendale and Libertarian 
Dennis Decherd, a computer systems analyst from Pasadena, will also be on the 
ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The other primaries in the San Gabriel Valley's congressional districts are 
uncontested.

ELECTIONS; GOP RACE IN 36TH DISTRICT BOILS DOWN TO WAR OF WORDS; SUSAN BROOKS 
AND RON FLORANCE EXCHANGE CHARGES IN FIERCE CAMPAIGNS FOR NEXT WEEK'S PRIMARY. 
THE WINNER WILL FACE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT JANE HARMAN IN NOVEMBER. 
</P>

<P>
 Republicans Susan Brooks and Ron Florance are running for a seat that 
stretches from Venice to San Pedro, but their battle for the 36th Congressional 
District has been waged almost entirely in their own back yards: the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican contenders live just a few miles apart, share some of the same 
acquaintances and travel in some of the same social circles. But in the 
campaign that culminates with Tuesday's primary, they have been bitter rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, 59, a former Palos Verdes Estates city councilman, is seen by 
opponents as a good-old-boy Republican, financing much of his campaign with the 
real estate riches he made in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, 44, a city councilwoman from Rancho Palos Verdes, is characterized by 
her rival as a political opportunist who had grand designs on higher office 
even before she gained a spot on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's right? It might not matter come November, when the winner will face 
incumbent Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey), who has no opposition in the 
primary. Although the district's voter registration is almost evenly split 
between Republicans and Democrats, Harman has been able to shore up her support 
among top aerospace executives in the district while Brooks and Florence have 
battled. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor of the Brooks-Florence faceoff also should help Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dirtier it is (in the primary), it's always tougher to kiss and make up," 
said Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall, a Republican who is running 
for state Assembly but has not endorsed either congressional candidate. "No 
matter what anyone else says, this stuff is very personal. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Harman, incumbents whose congressional districts encompass parts of 
the South Bay are Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach), Rep. Walter R. Tucker III 
(D-Compton) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). In Tuesday's vote, Waters 
is unopposed, while Horn and Tucker face underfinanced challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP race to take on Harman in the fall, Brooks and Florance are united 
in their attacks on the incumbent, such as her support of President Clinton's 
budget plan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the harmony ends there. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has attacked Florance as a tight-fisted millionaire. Her most recent 
allegation: that he may make money off of his own campaign. Florance lent his 
campaign $150,000, but is charging the campaign the prime interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is he running? A campaign or a bank?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance said his lawyers advised him to place the interest rate on the loan. 
"If you make a loan, you charge interest," Florance said. "Otherwise it is not 
a loan." 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause, a group that monitors campaign ethics, says charging interest on 
a campaign loan is legal although many candidates make interest-free loans. 
Besides, Florance said, he doubts that the campaign will ever be able to pay 
him back. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign also points out 40 lawsuits involving Florance or one of his 
businesses over the last nine years. Florance, however, said that he went to 
trial only once, and his side prevailed. He called other lawsuits frivolous, 
often filed against Carriage Realty, the real estate company he owned from 1982 
to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance says he has a list of successful entrepreneurial ventures, dating to 
his youth in Hollywood in the 1940s. As a child, he collected cooking grease 
from neighbors and lugged it to markets, where they paid him wartime ration 
money.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, as an executive at Proctor & Gamble, his management group tested 
and then introduced what is now Jif peanut butter. He was the top manager at 
two major brokerage firms in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s, he and the 
Ernest W. Hahn Co. developed the Shops at Palos Verdes. The partnership also 
donated land and money to build the Norris Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 In real estate, he displayed a keen sense of timing -- an instinct that has 
made him wealthy. His mansion, a Mediterranean-style villa that overlooks Santa 
Monica Bay, was designed by architect Bob Williams. The view is so spectacular 
that he jokes he will be able to make speeches to the entire district from his 
balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been around the horn," Florance said of his experience. "(Brooks has) 
questioned my ethics, but I have nothing to be ashamed of." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Florance's campaign has turned the attacks around, characterizing 
Brooks as a political opportunist prone to make reckless charges before 
checking the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows . . . how much she has to learn if she goes to Congress," Florance 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance points to Brooks' move up the political ladder. Her switch to the 
Republican Party in 1989, he said, was a politically expedient move in a 
Republican-leaning district. 
</P>
<P>
 On the City Council last fall, Brooks voted against a utility tax to finance 
the upkeep of streets and roads, even though she had earlier supported the 
measure. The tax, she said, should have gone to a vote of the people.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of Brooks' career has been as a special-education teacher in the New 
York, Virginia and Los Angeles public school systems. But she began working on 
civic causes shortly after she and her family moved to Rancho Palos Verdes in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, she fought the closure of Marineland, organized a 
Neighborhood Watch program and revived her neighborhood association. From her 
living room, she looks at one of her first accomplishments: getting stripes 
painted on her street to improve safety. In 1989, she was appointed to the city 
Planning Commission, and was elected to the City Council in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 As a city official, she helped line up private instructors to run the city's 
parks and recreation programs, one of her proudest accomplishments because it 
helped balance the city budget and maintain services. She also co-authored a 
Southern California Assn. of Governments study last year that led to the 
group's support of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This campaign is about real people and how you treat them in real life," she 
said. "I'm carrying their flag, carrying their torch." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates have not wasted any chance to get in digs against each other. 
Florance tells the story that he bought bubble gum from the neighborhood 
shopkeeper for 2 cents and then sold it for 5 cents at school. Brooks called it 
"scalping."  
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who does public relations work for nonprofit groups, is listed on the 
ballot as a businesswoman. Florance says she has never operated a business. 
"This is only out of her house," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Also running in the district are Libertarian Jack Tyler and American 
Independent Party candidate Joseph (Joe) Fields.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th District two years ago, Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) 
inched past Compton schools trustee Lynn Dymally in a bitter Democratic primary 
that featured name-calling and public shouting matches. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Tucker appears headed for a smoother ride. His opponent, Rancho 
Palos Verdes businessman Lew Prulitsky, has no political experience, and so far 
has offered mild criticism. He also does not live in the district.  
</P>
<P>
 Prulitsky, 61, says Tucker is unresponsive, rarely shows up in the district 
and has failed to introduce significant legislation to help his constituents. 
Tucker, 36, a former Compton mayor, said he visits the district three or four 
times a month. Tucker's staff set up 12 Town Hall meetings over the last two 
years dealing with crime, immigration, health care and other pressing issues, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker says that during his two years in the House of Representatives he has 
worked to keep the Long Beach Naval Shipyard open, to bring a job training 
center to Wilmington and a light-rail manufacturing plant to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains to be seen is whether an FBI bribery probe into Tucker and other 
former Compton officials will hurt his reelection hopes. Tucker said his 
financial records have been subpoenaed. He denies any wrongdoing, and 
speculates that the investigation could be fueled by his political enemies. "I 
have nothing to hide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the primary will face Libertarian Guy Wilson of San Pedro in the 
November general election.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 38th District, which includes San Pedro, freshman Rep. Steve Horn 
(R-Long Beach) is waging his first reelection campaign while he recuperates 
from prostate surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn, 62, underwent surgery in Washington on May 23, six weeks after doctors 
found evidence of the cancer during a routine examination. "It was a surprise, 
but it was caught in a very early and treatable stage," said Horn's 
spokeswoman, Mary Hinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn faces one primary challenger, John B. Duke, a quality-assurance 
consultant with Control Design Systems in Los Angeles. A newcomer to politics, 
Duke, 49, is running his campaign from his residence, a boat in the Long Beach 
marina. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will face challengers from three parties in November: Democrat 
Peter Mathews, Libertarian Lester W. Mueller and Peace and Freedom candidate 
Richard K. Green. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the 35th District has been very quiet. Incumbent Maxine Waters has 
no opposition and neither does Republican businessman Nate Truman. The district 
includes Gardena, Hawthorne, Inglewood, Lennox and portions of Los Angeles.

BUSINESS LEADERS FORM COALITION, TAKE AIM AT REGIONAL WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westside business leaders are banding together, hoping to press for solutions 
to regional problems ranging from traffic to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the effort, being led by four utility companies, is to form a 
Westside Assn. of Chambers of Commerce that would include as many as 14 local 
chambers to lobby state and local government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues facing the Westside are transcending municipal boundaries," said 
Bill Boyd, executive director of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce. "Our 
Westside cities now all have similar concerns, and our shared goal is to 
address those problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the new association is that bigger is better -- or, at least, 
louder. The coalition, expected to be in place later this summer, will send a 
clearer message from the local business community to state and local 
policy-makers, said Mark Olson, area manager for Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have more clout because more business leaders are involved," Olson 
said, asserting that politicians would be more responsive when approached by a 
single group representing numerous chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking bans, for example, would have been a good issue for the new business 
group to have been involved in, Olson said. The association could have taken 
part in discussions and made uniform recommendations on the bans, which have 
been passed in many Westside cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said the interest of Edison and the three other utilities leading the 
effort -- The Gas Co., Pacific Bell and GTE -- is similar to that of all 
prospective members of the association: to prevent business flight and improve 
the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The group says numerous cross-border problems are worsening the local business 
climate -- Santa Monica Boulevard traffic backing up from West Hollywood into 
Beverly Hills, panhandlers staking out corners in Hollywood and Venice, crime 
throughout the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no single project is on the association's agenda so far, one group 
member hopes to drum up support for light-rail transit service on the 
Exposition line, the Southern Pacific railroad right of way that runs east and 
west parallel to Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 At an initial meeting of more than a dozen local chambers last month, it was 
determined that a key priority of Westside communities is to promote the 
entertainment industry, said California Film Commission Director Patti Stolkin 
Archuletta, who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's impact on the local economy is undeniable, she said, pointing 
out that the Westside is home to Fox, Sony and Paramount studios, and a 
proliferation of related businesses including post-production, audio and 
special-effects companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are finally getting away from provincial thinking, and are starting to 
see things regionally," Archuletta said. "They are beginning to work on 
regional solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to create an association of Westside chambers follows similar 
efforts elsewhere in the Los Angeles area. South Bay chambers have banded 
together to address problems affecting the aerospace industry, and business 
organizations in Ventura County also have joined forces, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the new Westside Assn. of Chambers marks the second time local 
chambers have tried to present a common front. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1985, an association of Westside chambers was created and 
addressed a range of regional issues over a two-year period. Among other 
efforts, the group successfully fought a proposal to restrict the use of 
billboards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization disbanded in 1987 after a change in leadership, said Bill 
Welsh, a founder of that group who is now president emeritus of the Hollywood 
Chamber of Commerce and a participant in the new association. 
</P>
<P>
 Welsh and other organizers of the new group say business organizations must 
band together now because the riots of 1992, last year's fires and the Jan. 17 
earthquake have dealt the Westside serious economic blows, heightening the 
importance of retaining businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '80s the economy was going great guns. During that time, businesses 
did not need to band together," said Olson. "Now they do."

DUARTE GROUP BEGINS CAMPAIGN TO RECALL MAYOR OVER TAX PLAN; GOVERNMENT: BACKERS 
MUST GATHER 2,100 SIGNATURES TO FORCE AN ELECTION. THE ACTION CULMINATES A 
HEATED DEBATE OVER PROPOSED 3% LEVY ON UTILITIES.

<P>
 The Duarte Taxpayers Group served Mayor Margaret F. Finlay with papers Tuesday 
initiating a recall drive against her after the City Council reaffirmed its 
decision to implement a 3% utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've still got to gather 2,100 signatures for a recall election," Finlay 
said. "They can do whatever they like. Regrettably, they don't understand the 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 to reject a proposal by Councilman James D. Kirchner 
to use city reserves rather than impose the new tax. Council members Finlay, 
John R. Fasana and Ginny Joyce opposed Kirchner's motion; Councilman Philip R. 
Reyes supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council directed staff members to draw up a budget for the 
fiscal year beginning July 1 that includes a tax on water, gas, electricity, 
telephone and cable bills. During May, under pressure from residents, the 
council gradually cut the rate from 5% to 3%, a cost to the average household 
of about $15 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the taxpayers group said they would proceed with the recall 
petition drive unless the tax was abandoned or put on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are targeting Margaret Finlay because she is the leader of the tax 
proponents on the council," said Lino Paras, a member of the group that filed 
the notice of intent to circulate a recall petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Finlay said opponents of the tax had opportunities through the last year to 
speak to a citizen's committee that recommended the utility tax, along with 
cuts, as a way to deal with a $1.5-million budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the existing proposal, the shortfall would be made up by $880,000 in 
cuts, including the elimination of two jobs, $194,000 in fee increases and 
$480,000 a year generated by the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, Finlay, supported by Joyce and Fasana, argued with 
Kirchner, accusing him of threatening the future of the city by depleting the 
$2.8-million reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's poor taste to paint me in that light," said Kirchner, who suggested that 
the city should look into asking neighboring cities about hiring their police 
departments rather than the Sheriff's Department at an annual cost of $2 
million. He and Reyes say recession-ravaged businesses and residents cannot 
readily absorb another tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the tax, including some residents, city commissioners and 
employees, argued with its opponents Tuesday, accusing them of being willing to 
sacrifice public safety and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mack, a resident and city code enforcement officer, said: "Roughly $15 a 
month is a small price to pay for the quality of life in our town."

UNDAUNTED BY DISASTER; PASADENA GLEN'S FIRES AND FLOODS ARE SEEN AS COST OF 
REALLY LIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 During 27 years of disasters, Stevan Young has been dragged through the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Literally. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old Pasadena Glen resident lost his home -- as well as the house 
he grew up in -- to last year's fires. He's been through three major mudslides, 
one so forceful that it swept his truck -- with him in it -- half a mile down 
the canyon and stripped off his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 People in safer neighborhoods look at the disasters that historically befall 
the Glen and say, "What kind of person would live in a place like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stevan Young is the ultimate answer. 
</P>
<P>
 As spring came to the Glen months after the Oct. 27 fire, Young, a 
construction worker, relaxed in the orange seats of the trailer he lives in as 
he waits to rebuild. He cranked up a Bruce Springsteen CD, unperturbed by the 
rain outside that threatened new floods. 
</P>
<P>
 Disasters of epic magnitude are a trade-off for living in what Young calls a 
sanctuary from the urban jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You love it for what it is," he said. "You take what it throws back at you, 
but you love it for what it is."  
</P>
<P>
 With the resiliency of a Glen rat, Young has braved one catastrophe after 
another for the privilege of living here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love hearing the birdcalls. I love seeing the raccoons go by in a line with 
pups behind them," Young said recently. "Just two mornings ago, there was a 
buck, doe and fawn. And listening to the creek is so soothing. It's the kind of 
community where you know most of the people. You don't find that kind of 
camaraderie in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Pasadena, Young moved to the Glen in 1967 with his parents and 
brother. He remembers riding Schwinn bikes, climbing trees and "playing with 
snakes and spiders." 
</P>
<P>
 His first flood came soon after. In 1969, an almost biblical rain pounded the 
Glen for a week straight. When the water burst loose, Young said, "we could 
hear the rumbling, and we could see cars rolling down like surfboards." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, another flood hit, on Feb. 14, a furious Valentine's Day greeting. 
Young was returning from a party at 2 a.m. Noting signs of trouble, he rushed 
up the road to warn his family and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 He reached them in time, but as he turned to leave, the crashing mud overtook 
him, flipping his truck and throwing him out the back window. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very first thing I said when it rolled me over was, 'This is finally it, 
I'm dead,' " he said. "The last thing I remember is holding onto the back 
bumper. Every time it went over a check dam, it would pole-vault me over the 
front, and I'd grab again as the truck went by. But, once, I missed. So then I 
grabbed onto a boulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors fished Young out as he neared the bottom of the canyon. His clothes, 
except for a belt and belt loops, had been ripped entirely off. The skin was 
torn off his knees, his teeth were chipped, and his head was gashed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Altadena firestorm struck before dawn on Oct. 27, Young rushed from 
his own place in the middle of the Glen to fight the fire, which was 
threatening his parents' house at the top of the canyon -- the home he grew up 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Windows were exploding like mortar fire, he said. Even with his shirt pulled 
over his head for protection, he could see the hail of red embers surrounding 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like being in a blizzard," he said. "The fireball went right by me. . 
. . I watched it jump across the canyon like an arm. The whole side of the 
canyon went up in flame like a great big newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 When the flames ignited the house next door, Young decided it was time to 
escape. But when he sprinted down the road to his own home, he found the pines 
next door ablaze. The fire had eaten so much oxygen from the air that his truck 
would barely start. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents' house burned to the ground, as did Young's own. Now withered 
trees that used to shade the street hang listlessly over the muddy road. 
Flights of stairs climb to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was house-sitting in Sierra Madre when February's flood struck, he 
returned to shoot videotape of the raging creek from the very spot where he had 
been swept away 14 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 About two months ago, Young came back to stay -- at first in a camping tent 
and then in a trailer -- despite the onset of spring storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of his neighbors, Young plans to rebuild. More than 30 homeowners 
affected by the Altadena fire have applied for building permits to repair 
partially or completely damaged houses. About half have been granted permits, 
including one resident of the Glen. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Glen residents hope to apply for building permits soon, said Linda 
Williams, president of the Pasadena Glen Improvement Assn. On April 12, the 
association reached an agreement with the county on conditions for rebuilding, 
including improved flood control measures, turnouts on the road to accommodate 
emergency vehicles and the clearing of fire-prone vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the burns and bruises of the past 27 years, Young never considered 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to do, find someplace better?" he asked. "Well, there is 
no place better. This is the best there is."

SIDLEY COULD SWAY STATE SENATE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until recently, the 28th State Senate District primary focused on the battle 
between incumbent Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) and Torrance Councilman George 
Nakano. 
</P>
<P>
 But Venice attorney Mike Sidley, a political unknown when he entered the race 
three months ago, has spent $141,785 this year, ahead of Nakano with $84,598 
but still far behind Dills with $337,053. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on whom you ask, a strong showing by Sidley on Tuesday will boost 
the fortunes of either Dills or Nakano. But the Sidley campaign predicts a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the front-runner," said Rick Rosenthal, Sidley's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, 84, is running in a reapportioned district that includes the beach 
cities and Torrance, where he is largely unknown.  
</P>
<P>
 His rivals have tried to target him as a longtime incumbent out of touch with 
voters. But a strong Sidley showing could draw votes away from Nakano and hand 
the race to Dills, analysts say. In the 1974 primary, Dills won when a third 
candidate entered the race and drew votes away from a strong challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sidley's spending) hurts George more than it hurts us," said Tim Mock, 
Dills' campaign manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Sidley, 32, sent three mailers within one week in early May, before Dills and 
Nakano started mailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now Nakano is the 'Johnny come lately' to the majority of the electorate," 
Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others predict that Dills will be hurt the most because both challengers 
are attacking his incumbency. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will be turned off by Dills," said Loyola Marymount political science 
professor Fernando J. Guerra. "In a way, he will be splitting the Anglo vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano's campaign also has the most cash, apparently to be used for a 
last-minute blitz in the mail or on cable TV. According to the latest campaign 
disclosure statements, Nakano had $130,765 in cash on hand to Sidley's $34,748. 
Dills had $95,448. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Sidley's money has been spent establishing name recognition, whereas 
Nakano is well-known in Torrance and neighboring cities, said Debbie Cox, 
Nakano's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Dills campaign poll, Sidley ranked behind Manhattan Beach real estate 
broker Jo Ann Rodda, who plans to spend no more than $1,000 on the race. But 
that poll was conducted before Sidley sent out his mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidley "doesn't have a natural base," Cox said. "He is just not known." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano has drawn support from environmentalists, including the Sierra Club and 
the California League of Conservation Voters. Last week, the Sierra Club's 
Angeles chapter charged that Sidley has implied that he has received the club's 
endorsement. Sidley joined the group in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a nice enough guy, but he really doesn't have a program; he has 
ambition," said Emil Lawton, chairman of the Sierra Club's political committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidley is a member of the Los Angeles County Environmental Crimes Sentencing 
Task Force, and his family members have long been affiliated with the Sierra 
Club, Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of when he joined the organization or when he went to the 
meetings," Rosenthal said. "It's a matter of commitment to the environment."

FOR STUDENTS, IT'S AN ACT OF HEALING; EDUCATION: SALLY KIRKLAND HELPS KIDS AT 
CURTISS JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL TAP INTO THEIR EMOTIONS AND VENT FRUSTRATION. HER 
WORKSHOP IS PART OF THE ACHIEVEMENT AND COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
 Sixty students in their early teens sitting in the Carson school library focus 
on their classmate standing at the front of the room, shushing anyone who dares 
to make a sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want you to hold me," Jabari Uko, 13, wails and then collapses against 
a woman's shoulder, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Jabari beams at the crowd, wiping tears from his cheek, looking 
like someone who just won a prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good to get all the frustration out," Jabari tells the group. "I 
guess I was angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the exchange with Jabari, actress Sally Kirkland prompted him to 
focus on his feelings by saying to him: "I'm your mother. What do you need from 
me?" 
</P>
<P>
 By helping students at Glen Hammond Curtiss Junior High School tap into their 
emotions, Kirkland hopes to help them release some of their frustrations -- and 
maybe become good actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can actually use some of their own lives and turn it into art," Kirkland 
says. "Or they can turn this into just plain therapy and get it off of their 
chests." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland got hooked on coming to the school through the Achievement and 
Commitment to Excellence Program, a part of the nonprofit Educare Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, ACE has worked in more than 60 schools across the country. The 
program adopted Curtiss last fall, and since then has worked with school 
officials to create partnerships among businesses, community groups and the 
school. ACE officials estimate the group will work with Curtiss for at least 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Kirkland's eight acting workshops, ACE took 70 students to Soka 
University in Calabasas for a weekend retreat in March. They attended seminars 
on leadership skills and conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also arranged the donation of a drum set for the school band and 
found a copying machine for teachers to use until the school's copier can be 
replaced. In a few weeks, ACE will oversee the installation of 12 to 15 stall 
doors in the boy's bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see ourselves as a support system to really meet the needs the schools 
have," says Stu Semigran, ACE's program director.  
</P>
<P>
 School Principal Bill Elkins says an equally important aspect of the program 
is that it boosts campus morale by showing students and faculty that people on 
the outside take an interest in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its leadership and self-esteem training, ACE also reinforces the 
themes the school staff promotes: be prompt and prepared for school, treat 
others as you want to be treated and do your best. 
</P>
<P>
 Elkins says Kirkland's sessions serve as a reward for students who stick to 
these principles. As Elkins describes it, if you don't measure up, you don't 
participate. Even Kirkland's manner during the sessions bolsters the school's 
emphasis on courtesy and respect, Elkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very demanding in the sense that she doesn't allow any side talk. That 
reinforces the kind of expectations we have for our kids -- the sense that they 
are here for business," Elkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 But taking care of business doesn't mean they don't have fun. With Kirkland 
circling the room trying to engage even the shyest students in the activities, 
the noise level is a controlled roar. 
</P>
<P>
 When she asks for attention she gets it, but there's plenty of time spent 
singing along and dancing to rapper Hammer's "2 Legit to Quit." One student 
leads the dancing and the rest try to mimic the moves, with Kirkland and other 
professional actors in her group joining in. 
</P>
<P>
 All ninth-graders interested in acting or entertainment could attend the 
two-hour workshops. Teachers' approval is required for participation, and this 
is based on the student's citizenship and academics, which must be 
satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean getting all A's," Elkins says. "It means doing the best 
they can."

PARENTS ARE DOING KOMBAT OVER VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The words finish him appeared on the video screen, and the player maneuvered 
the controls to carry out a brutal blow that decapitated his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The realistic graphics depicted blood spurting from the severed neck. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just one of the many deaths acted out in the popular video game Mortal 
Kombat II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nice game. Bring the family," said one of the boy's friends, and they picked 
up their sodas and walked out of the 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the most popular video games on today's market feature that type of 
hand-to-hand combat. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the violence in the games, parents on the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
have turned to local officials, pressuring them to remove Mortal Kombat and 
other video games from two cinema complexes, the Terraces in Rancho Palos 
Verdes and the Peninsula 9 in Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 George Krikorian, who owns those and six other cinemas in Southern California, 
said he has received more than 100 protest letters in the past two months, all 
from people living on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the effort is resident Bill Ruth, who said the content of the games is 
desensitizing youth to the horrors of violence and is even encouraging such 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
 He has raised his concerns with local schools and churches and wants Krikorian 
to exchange games such as Mortal Kombat, X-Men and Terminator for what he 
considers equally challenging but nonviolent entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The violent games are interactive and addictive, he said. "It's different from 
sitting and watching TV passively. When you're playing them, you're controlling 
the outcome. We're teaching our kids to solve their problems through violence," 
Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the community's distaste for the games, Rancho Palos Verdes 
officials are working on changing ordinances so that the city can limit the 
number of games allowed in businesses and the hours they can be played.  
</P>
<P>
 But the city cannot control the content of the games, Mayor Steve Kuykendall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right to have those games and to put them out and to use them is an 
absolutely protected right under the First Amendment," Kuykendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krikorian's peninsula theaters contain a total of 19 games, mostly videos. 
</P>
<P>
 He supports the rating of games so that the age limit of players is 
restricted, but adds that video games should not be singled out by people 
worried about increasing violence in society. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly have valid concerns, but I really don't think this is the way 
to deal with it. I think they should start by not letting their kids watch the 
6 o'clock news," Krikorian said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said he is considering removing the games from his theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until such time there is a rating system . . . maybe the best thing is for us 
not to have the game because we're not there to offend people." 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation to establish a "video game rating administration" in an effort to 
control video violence is due to be introduced by Assemblywoman Diane Martinez 
(D-Monterey Park) on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Mortal Kombat II is in 90% of all major arcades, Krikorian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Peter Donovan, 18, of Lomita, the game is a natural progression from horror 
movies such as "Nightmare on Elm Street" that he watched as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who grew up in the '80s is used to it," said Donovan as he played the 
game recently at a 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew up with Freddie Krueger and all that stuff being fed to us. It 
doesn't shock us. It's only parents who are worried."

<P>
 Officials say reconstruction of the Horseshoe Pier, which sustained more than 
$6 million in damage from storms and a fire in 1988, could be finished by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope for a reopening celebration in January.

BRIEFLY: ENVIRONMENT: VIEWS SOUGHT ON BAY CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The public may comment at two public hearings today on a five-year plan to 
clean up Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project, which is administered by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, affects an area from the Ventura County line 
to Point Fermin. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan, released in April, identifies 73 priority actions that will 
cost an estimated $67 million. A foundation has been set up to secure funding 
from government and private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Many organizations, including Heal the Bay, the American Oceans Campaign, 
Chevron Corp., Southern California Edison, Heal the Bay and the Sierra Club, 
support the plan, EPA spokeswoman Karen Caesar said. 
</P>
<P>
 A final draft will be submitted to Gov. Pete Wilson in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that people realize the plan affects not just the bay but also 
the watershed -- the whole area that drains into the bay. That's 414 square 
miles," Caesar said. "A big part of our work is pollution protection."  
</P>
<P>
 The first hearing will be at 10 a.m. at the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality 
Control Board, 101 Center Plaza Drive, Monterey Park. Those who cannot attend 
may send written comments to Caesar at that address. The comments must be 
received by June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 A second meeting will be at 6 p.m. in the IRI Room of the Veterans Memorial 
Building, 4117 Overland Ave., Culver City. SUSAN WOODWARD

 A lottery will be held for students who want to switch schools in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board, which used to allow transfers on a first-come, first-served 
basis, has changed its policy to fit state guidelines on open enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who want to transfer must apply for a permit. All transfers will 
based on available space at the school, and beginning in the fall, the names of 
students for open slots will be picked at random, said Joice Bailey Lewis, 
director of pupil services.  
</P>
<P>
 Students who attend their local school will not be displaced by transfer 
applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new guidelines, applicants who cite hardship as a reason for 
transfer will no longer be given preferential treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 The policy does not apply to those who want to transfer outside of the 
district. JON GARCIA

BRIEFLY: PARKS: LAND PARCEL DONATED TO CITIZENS GROUP

 A South Bay family has donated half an acre of land in Ken Malloy Harbor 
Regional Park to a nonprofit citizens group. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zappas Family Trust gave the land to the Harbor Park Restoration Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-acre lot was the only part of the park that was privately owned, said 
Frank O'Brien, chairman of the group that has worked to preserve and improve 
the park since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zappas trust had planned to build a housing development on the land, 
Michael Zappas said, but "the construction options we looked at didn't seem 
viable, and this gift will ensure that the land remains in good hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The 230-acre park on the border of Wilmington and Harbor City contains one of 
the last remaining freshwater wetlands and riparian woodlands in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 A master plan suggesting park improvements was recently presented to Los 
Angeles by the citizens group. SUSAN WOODWARD

CANDIDATES MINE FOR WORKING-CLASS VOTES; STATE SENATE: IN 24TH DISTRICT 
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, ASSEMBLYWOMAN HILDA SOLIS TOUTS HER EXPERIENCE. BUT THE PAY 
RAISE OF SOLIS AND OTHER LAWMAKERS IS EUGENE MOSES' TRUMP CARD. 
</P>

<P>
 Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) and Eugene F. Moses, the former 
mayor of Azusa, are working the blue-collar crowd, looking for votes in the 
Democratic primary Tuesday for the state Senate's 24th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to work to have jobs here, to have better schools . . . to fight 
against gangs," said Solis at a recent candidate forum. She then put her best 
cards on the table: "I have been in the Assembly two years and I have many 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Moses sounded some of the same notes at the forum. He also tried to take some 
of the shine off Solis' time in Sacramento, noting that she and other 
legislators are to receive a $19,500 pay raise on Jan. 1. It will boost their 
annual salaries to $72,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The $20,000 for each of the senators and assembly people could buy you a 
library," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legislators said they will decline the raise in light of the state's 
financial problems. Solis said she is still considering the issue, noting that 
the salaries were boosted by an independent citizens commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a governor-appointed commission and it seems the decision was timed 
to be inconvenient" for legislators seeking reelection, Solis said in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis is favored to win the Democratic primary for the 24th District, which 
includes all or part of Alhambra, Arcadia, Azusa, Baldwin Park, El Monte, 
Hacienda Heights, Industry, Irwindale, La Puente, Monterey Park, Rosemead, San 
Gabriel, West Covina and La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses represents her biggest hurdle to the upper house. The other Democratic 
candidate, Joseph R. Chavez, a data processing supervisor, has never held 
public office and has little money to enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Democratic primary is expected to take the seat in November. 
Democrats account for 58% of the registered voters in the 24th District, 
compared with 29% for Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses, a councilman and mayor for 16 years, declared his intention to run for 
the district more than a year ago. The seat was created through the 1992 
reapportionment and approximates the district represented by Sen. Art Torres 
(D-Los Angeles), who is running for state Insurance Commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the bad news for Moses; Solis was entering the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblywoman has a respectable legislative record, good name recognition 
and good fund-raising capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey by the California Journal, a magazine on state politics, 
ranked Solis among the top half of Assembly members rated. "She's steady, 
bright, hard-working and dependable," according to the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis has raised $206,114 and spent $133,608 compared with Moses' $91,758 in 
contributions and $90,761 in spending, according to the latest financial 
disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino political heavyweights, such as Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria 
Molina, have endorsed Solis, 36, who also has strong support from various law 
enforcement officials and educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnicity is another advantage for Solis, who is of Mexican and Nicaraguan 
decent and an advocate of immigrants' rights. Latinos account for about 54% of 
registered Democrats in the district, according to her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis, like Moses, speaks of the need to create more jobs, improve education 
and reduce crime in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But from there, the assemblywoman stresses her experience in the state 
Capitol. Solis, for example, authored legislation that made spousal rape an 
automatic felony punishable by up to eight years in state prison. The old law 
allowed someone convicted of spousal rape to be found guilty of a misdemeanor 
and serve time in county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Moses) has the level of understanding it takes to build 
legislative coalitions and work on legislative matters," Solis said in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses, 60, is best known for his efforts as mayor to close the Azusa rock 
quarry at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains to curb air pollution. It was a 
losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of more than a decade of often contentious municipal politics, Moses 
left city government to run for state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay raise issue is his trump card. He figures taxpayers will take a dim 
view of the hike in an era of shrinking government and household budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 While going door-to-door in Hacienda Heights, Moses ran into a teacher who 
questioned how the legislators could accept a raise while schools suffer under 
continuing cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty thousand isn't right," Moses agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one asked Solis about the raise on a recent campaign walk. Most of the 
questions and comments centered on curbing crime.  
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Dave Boyer and 
Libertarian George Curtis Feger, who are running uncontested on June 7.

TOURISM; SHE'S MAPPED OUT AN ASTRONOMIC CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS FIELDS-MEYER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've come to Los Angeles in search of Richard Gere, then Betty Merjil 
can't help you. "We don't have him," she said. "My sister's coming down to 
visit from Vegas, and she wants to find him, but there's nothing I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're looking for Warren Beatty, Kirk Douglas or, perchance, Barry 
Manilow, then Merjil is your woman. Johnny Carson? Roseanne Arnold? Buddy 
Hackett? With barely a second thought, she can have you on their doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't that Merjil is so tight with all those folks. In fact, she's never 
met any of them. But she is among the world's leading authorities on where 
Hollywood celebrities live. The 62-year-old great-grandmother is the unofficial 
(and unheralded) dean of the city's "star map" vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Merjil has spent most of the last 15 years standing on the same street corner, 
hawking the guides, which list the addresses of movie stars, TV personalities 
and a wide array of entertainers past and present. Then again, it's a pretty 
nice corner, a lush, green intersection in Holmby Hills, on North Mapleton 
Drive -- just north of Sunset Boulevard and a stone's throw from Casey Kasem's 
place and a couple of blocks north of Aaron Spelling's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, she inherited the family business. Before Merjil took over the post 
in 1979, her mother, Frances Ward, worked the same spot for a quarter of a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't come out like I used to if it's rainy and cold," Merjil said. "But 
almost every day, I'll be here. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 For $6 (plus tax), Merjil sells what is labeled "a guide to Starland estates 
and mansions, a fascinating trip through Movieland." The guide, updated 
quarterly to account for the fluctuations of celebrity geography, shows areas 
of Bel-Air, Beverly Hills and Holmby Hills, and lists the addresses of more 
than 200 living and deceased stars, from Jack Nicholson and Lou Costello to 
Henry Mancini and Helen Reddy. 
</P>
<P>
 What's new on the map? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Merjil said one recent afternoon, reviewing one of her maps, "we've 
got Sylvester Stallone on Beverly Drive. Frank Sinatra is back with us -- he 
bought the house from Mel Brooks. Tom Cruise is on Beverly Glen. And one more. 
Rod Stewart up on Laurel Way." 
</P>
<P>
 The other news in the star-map industry is that business is off. Merjil can't 
remember it being worse. "It started to slip off in '91 after the riots," she 
said. "We thought it would pick up after that, but you know, it really hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Merjil and other vendors speculate that the proliferation of private van tours 
may be contributing to the dearth of buyers for the maps. A 10-map day is a 
good showing for Merjil. "But yesterday," she said one recent day, "I came out 
and sold one map. And on Saturday I sold four. That's bad for a weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Merjil buys the maps from Vivian Welton of Van Nuys, whose father, Wesley G. 
Lake, started publishing the guides in 1936. Welton, who occasionally hawks the 
maps herself, is perplexed by the slow sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's the recession mostly," she said. "And, of course, people hear 
about the crime and everything. It's been awfully slow." 
</P>
<P>
 You might think that someone who carries around the addresses of Elizabeth 
Taylor and Steven Spielberg would spend her spare time dining at Spago or 
carousing at Bel-Air cocktail parties. But Merjil's work is hardly glamorous. 
Mostly, it involves long hours waiting in her Dodge van for motorists to show 
some curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 To pass the time, she writes letters and reads People magazine and the 
National Enquirer. But there are occasional perks. Merjil has had her share of 
brushes with fame. Peter Falk once asked her for an address. Faye Dunaway once 
stopped to chat. "Pia Zadora did a whole thing in her white limousine," Merjil 
recalled. "She gave me a nice autographed photo of herself. Color, too -- not 
black and white." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Merjil says, she'll never top her mother, who regularly had chats with 
Elvis Presley. (The King owned a home around the corner from the vendor's 
outpost.) "He called her 'Sunset Annie,' " she said. "He'd come by here all the 
time and talk to her." 
</P>
<P>
 All the map vendors have their own stories about celebrity encounters. Welton 
once sold a map to Marilyn Monroe -- but didn't realize it was the movie star 
until someone pointed it out months later. Bill Divine, who sells Welton's maps 
a few blocks east of Merjil, laughs when he remembers the time he met Jay Leno. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bunch of customers had stopped. He drove up and yelled: 'Help me, I'm lost! 
I can't find my house!' " recalled Divine, who works around the corner 
(according to the map) from Barbra Streisand's spread and Walt Disney's last 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The map vendors need a Los Angeles business license and must stake out their 
own sales spot. On a couple of occasions, Welton has had to defend her turf 
from interlopers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just stood in front of them and gave our maps for free, so they didn't 
last long," she said. "We've worked too hard to have someone come and take our 
business away." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, few celebrities stop the vendors to complain about their 
listings on the maps. That may be because the maps bear an admonition of the 
sort that might show up at a national park or a zoo: "Please Do Not Disturb the 
Celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
 And Merjil discourages harassment. "We tell people just to drive by," she 
said. "Don't climb the fences, don't stop. Take a picture, enjoy and keep 
going. That's what tourists are supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 She says there's nothing she'd rather do. She loves the work and the contact 
with people. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people are so disappointed in so many things when they visit Los 
Angeles," she said. "So if I can make it a little more pleasant and happy for 
them, then I feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 How long will she hold out? 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother worked the corner until she was 72, and Merjil plans to keep 
working for a few years. But she has big plans for her retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is to travel to Memphis," she says. "I want to visit Graceland."

TOPICS; RECREATION; OFFICIALS PUT THE BRAKES ON SKATEBOARDING; MANHATTAN BEACH: 
COMPLAINTS FROM MERCHANTS LEAD TO BAN IN DOWNTOWN AREA. NEW LAW DRAWS FIRE FROM 
SIDEWALK SURFERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zak Rangwala and Paul da Costa love to skateboard on Manhattan Beach's 
challenging downtown sidewalks, but they may be skating on thin concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 With the wind in their hair and the rush of pavement under their feet, the 
South Bay teen-agers frequently jump on their boards to brave the bumpy blue 
tiles and dodge weekend strollers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the moment is right, they might even go for an "ollie impossible," 
flipping their boards wildly under their feet as they race perilously close to 
the curb. But soon they also might get cited by police. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials recently posted signs banning skateboarders from the area. In 
response to merchants' complaints over sidewalk surfers, the City Council voted 
unanimously last month to exclude them from downtown sidewalks and much of 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reeks," says Billy Peretti, an eighth-grader at Manhattan Beach 
Intermediate School. The new law takes aim at Peretti's main set of wheels, his 
only transportation between school and work several miles away.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's bogus, plain and simple," says Mark John Hayes, 20, a Manhattan Beach 
surfer who cruises area streets on his skateboard when the wind-whipped waves 
turn bad. "What else do kids have to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the skateboarders can take their fun elsewhere. The new 
law, which also bans skateboarders from city parking lots, is designed to 
protect pedestrians and parked cars from freewheeling skateboarders. Hermosa 
Beach has a similar law. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the boards sometimes shoot out from under skaters' feet to dent 
cars or hit strollers. Since the law took effect about two weeks ago, police 
have issued only warnings, but eventually violators will be fined $100 to $200, 
said City Atty. Tim McOsker. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news to many merchants and pedestrians. Tom Scalzo, a well-tanned 
Manhattan Beach man, says he's seen plenty of near-misses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only a matter of time before some kid would nail some old lady," says 
Scalzo, 33, who sits in front of a popular downtown coffee shop weekday 
mornings to sip java. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalzo grew up surfing in the South Bay, but he never skateboarded. "I'm sort 
of against it," he says. "You can get hurt on those things." 
</P>
<P>
 But many skateboarders say Manhattan Beach's new law is too broad, punishing 
all skateboarders when only a handful skate dangerously. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids could be out vandalizing," says Eric Zucker, 24, who owns the Ocean 
Gear surf shop in downtown Manhattan Beach. Zucker's shop attracts many area 
skateboarders who, in their baggy shorts and skateboard sneakers, sometimes 
practice "curb grinds" along the nearby sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Zucker says he's received a few complaints, but says the skateboarders outside 
his shop are considerate of passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 Many skateboarders out on the busy streets Saturday afternoon ignored the new 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 A sandy-haired teen-ager, bare-chested and bare-footed, dropped his 
two-foot-long board on Manhattan Beach Boulevard near Manhattan Avenue and 
jumped on. As a gust of wind blew off the ocean, he pushed off the sidewalk and 
sped down the middle of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hum of his wheels echoed up the hill, a car motored by. He crouched low 
and turned toward the curb, waiting for it to pass. When the coast cleared, he 
tucked his body close to the ground and made a beeline toward the pier.

BRIEFLY: ENVIRONMENT: BAY CLEANUP HEARINGS SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The public may comment at two public hearings today on a five-year plan to 
clean up Santa Monica Bay, part of the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, affects an area from the Ventura County line to Point Fermin. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan, released in April, identifies 73 priority actions that would 
cost an estimated $67 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The first hearing will be at 10 a.m. at the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality 
Control Board, 101 Center Plaza Drive, Monterey Park. Those who cannot attend 
may send written comments to Karen Caesar at that address. The comments must be 
received by June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 A second meeting will be at 6 p.m. in the IRI Room of the Veterans Memorial 
Building, 4117 Overland Ave., Culver City.

TOPICS; LAW; CENTER TO OFFER RESOLUTION OPTIONS TO A SUIT-HAPPY SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TV shows such as "L.A. Law" have made it clear that people will sue other 
people for just about any reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren E. Burger, retired chief justice of the United States, has complained 
that the American system of dueling litigants is "too costly, too painful, too 
destructive, too inefficient for a truly civilized people." 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Judge Dorothy W. Nelson, one of the leaders of a new legal research 
center that seeks to banish the "I sue you, you sue me" blues burdening U.S. 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, former dean of the USC Law School and now on the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Pasadena, heads the board of the Western Justice Center, 
perched on a commanding site above the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 years of planning, the nonprofit center opens this week in a 
refurbished historic bungalow next to the federal courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which will study and devise ways to resolve conflicts without 
lawsuits, is starting out with two projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, the center will work with the Southern California Assn. of Governments 
to develop ways to resolve differences between governmental agencies. "State 
and local governments spend millions suing each other," Nelson said. "One water 
district sues another water district. It goes on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 The other project, using the basic approach for solving legal logjams, will 
train students at 21 schools in Santa Monica, Pasadena and South-Central Los 
Angeles in ways to settle conflicts without violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of mediation today," Nelson said. "Some of it's good. Some 
isn't. Our purpose is to evaluate what's going on and to encourage experiments 
and prescribe models." 
</P>
<P>
 The center, funded in part through gifts from Southern California law firms, 
is the first of its kind west of the Mississippi and is expected to attract 
scholars from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the center's work will be to train those in the legal community to 
prevent cases from becoming full-blown lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started teaching dispute resolution in 1957, it was considered 
'that woman's thing,' the softer form of resolving conflict," Nelson said. "Now 
it's the hottest topic in the justice system."

TOPICS; ROADS; AFTER 10 YEARS, CITIES AGREE TO FIX POTHOLES IN SHARED ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a decade of disagreement, Sierra Madre and Arcadia have 
finally smoothed over their differences and resolved to repair pothole-laden 
Orange Grove Avenue, which borders the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The avenue, a rustic country lane with no sidewalks, is a minefield of 
potholes and cracks waiting to jar any unsuspecting motorist driving from 
Michillinda Avenue to Rodeo Road. 
</P>
<P>
 A $2-million plan to repair the street cleared its final hurdle last month 
when the Sierra Madre City Council approved the project, which had been given 
the OK a week earlier by Arcadia council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took awhile, but the project had to be done properly with all residents 
agreeing to the construction," said newly appointed City Administrator Sean 
Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
 The project began with power pole relocation last month and should be 
completed by the end of 1995, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cities had to agree to the repairs because the avenue is Sierra Madre's 
on the north side and Arcadia's on the south side. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia, a growth-oriented city with money in the bank for street 
improvements, had fought for years to repave the rustic avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sierra Madre resisted its neighbor's wishes. Residents feared that a 
repaving would turn the rustic roadway into another alternate for the Foothill 
(210) Freeway and require the removal of 97 trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce said active traffic enforcement by both police departments will ensure 
that it does not become a high-speed route. As for the trees, he said, only one 
will be removed, and it will be replaced.

TOPICS; BUSINESS; MANY STORES SELL CIGARETTES TO TEEN-AGERS, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly half of convenience stores, grocery stores and gas stations surveyed in 
Pasadena will sell cigarettes to teen-agers too young to buy them legally, a 
recent countywide survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate increased to more than half among the stores in West Covina and 
nearly three-fourths in Monterey Park, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, spearheaded by LA LINK, a regional anti-smoking program, checked 
519 stores in 13 communities in Los Angeles County, including the three cities 
in the San Gabriel Valley. Volunteers ages 14 to 17 tried to buy cigarettes in 
the monthlong survey and found that more than 60% of the stores were willing to 
sell to them. To avoid breaking the law by actually buying the cigarettes, the 
teen-agers would terminate the sale at the last minute by claiming they had too 
little money. 
</P>
<P>
 It is against the law to sell cigarettes to anyone younger than 19, and store 
clerks are supposed to request identification from anyone who appears younger 
than 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey tested 87 Pasadena stores and found that 42 were willing to sell 
cigarettes to the teen-agers; in West Covina, it was 23 of 36 stores and in 
Monterey Park, 18 of 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one ever asked me for identification," said Darin Evans, 18, of Covina, 
who was 17 when he participated in the survey. Evans said clerks at 20 Pasadena 
stores were willing to sell to him. 
</P>
<P>
 About 120 teen-agers participated in the survey. Supermarkets were the least 
likely outlets to sell cigarettes to teen-agers, the survey found. Liquor 
stores were most likely.

 South Bay residents donated more than 18,000 pounds of food during a recent 
drive by postal workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive was conducted by members of the National Assn. of Letter Carriers, 
who collected the food during their postal runs on May 14 in an effort to 
restock food banks in time for summer. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 million pounds of food were donated nationwide, more than triple the 
amount collected in last year's inaugural drive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, the carriers collected 76,000 pounds of food. Los 
Angeles Regional Foodbank will distribute it to 750 local charities, 
spokeswoman Lorie Burstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charities help feed nearly 300,000 people a week, she said. South Bay 
beneficiaries include St. Lawrence Martyr Parish in Redondo Beach and the Asian 
Service Center in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really appreciate them doing it at this time because it's during the 
summer months that our donations drop off," Burstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service plans to continue the drive every year in the second 
week of May, a spokeswoman said. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; VOLUNTEERS WILL HELP LIBRARY EXTEND HOURS

<P>
 Volunteers will help the county's Wiseburn library here to stay open three 
days a week instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a program started last week, 24 volunteers have signed up to work 
regular hours shelving books, organizing magazine racks and examining materials 
for damage.The donated work has allowed the county-run library to open on 
Tuesdays from 1 to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is patterned after one used at the Lomita Library.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is particularly important work because of our budget situation," said 
Sandra Duncan, a county library manager. "The community is responding to the 
library's cries for help." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers must agree to work a fixed number of hours, generally eight a 
month.  
</P>
<P>
 But efforts to extend hours at the libraries may end as early as July because 
of budget problems. A $9-million shortfall may temporarily shut 49 of the 
county's 87 libraries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look good for us, but no one knows for sure what will happen," 
Duncan said. SCOTT SANDELL

 Library patrons with overdue books will soon get telephone reminders from a 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials have given Torrance Public Library's automated renewal 
system the task of calling people at home to remind them to return materials 
and to notify them that books on reserve have come in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will save us a considerable amount of money," said Norm Reeder, who runs 
library programs. He said the library currently spends 25 cents for each 
reminder sent by bulk mail. A local call costs 10 cents. The computer will call 
only from 3 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will try to call the resident three times, and if it can't connect, 
a notice will be sent by mail. MARY GUTHRIE

<P>
 The public will have its last opportunity to comment on the Palos Verdes 
Library District's 1994-95 budget at a board meeting June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The library board plans to report on proposals to reduce the cost of furniture 
for the Peninsula Center Library from $1.2 million to $820,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The community group Save Our Libraries recently criticized the district for 
being extravagant in a time when budgets have been cut to keep the peninsula's 
three libraries open. 
</P>
<P>
 The district expects to spend nearly $3 million next year, spokeswoman Nancy 
Mahr said. Expansion and renovation of the center library increased 
expenditures 7.7% over the current year. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at Rolling Hills Estates City Hall, Palos Verdes Drive 
North, at 7:30 p.m. SUSAN WOODWARD

 A Pomona police officer followed a trail of oil from a stripped car to a house 
where two men were arrested on suspicion of operating an auto theft ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Paul Capraro was driving near the 600 block of S. East End early 
Tuesday when he observed a Buick Regal in a spot where cars are seldom parked, 
Sgt. Elias Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Capraro examined the car, he found it was missing its transmission, 
engine and seats, and had been wiped down with an oily substance to obscure 
fingerprints, Valdez said. After checking on the license plate, Capraro 
discovered that the car had been reported stolen from Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 Capraro noticed a trail of oil leading to a nearby residence, where he found 
two more stolen cars that were in the process of being stripped and two men, 
one with grease on his hands. A hood from a stolen car that had previously been 
recovered also was found on the property, Valdez said, as well as numerous 
parts from other vehicles reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Damien Gonzalez, 25, who lived at the house, and Raul Gonzalez, 
35, whose house is on the same block. Police do not believe the two men are 
related. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that the location was used to dismantle stolen cars and 
distribute the parts for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we don't know how large the operation was," Valdez said. He 
said that three or four auto dismantling operations are in the area and that 
police will be investigating whether the men sold any of the parts to the auto 
shops.

 COVINA: A condom vending machine valued at $422 was stolen last week from the 
Bullshed Bar, 630 S. Shoppers Lane, between Tuesday night and Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 EL MONTE: A robbery victim who allegedly armed himself after the crime and 
killed one of his assailants has been arrested on suspicion of murder. The 
incident began late Friday evening outside Los Gavilotas Bar at 11437 Garvey 
Ave., when Allen Roberts, 39, of El Monte, and Anthony Arteaga, 31, of East Los 
Angeles, allegedly robbed two men at knifepoint. Emilio Avellaneda Huipio, 26, 
of La Puente, was stabbed in the side but did not suffer serious injuries. 
After the incident, the other robbery victim, Marco Valdez, an El Monte man 
described as in his 20s, reportedly obtained a semiautomatic rifle and fired 
several shots. One hit Roberts in the upper torso, killing him. Valdez was in 
custody, as was Arteaga, who was booked on suspicion of robbery. Huipio was 
questioned and released. 
</P>
<P>
 LA VERNE: A 22-year-old man was robbed and stabbed Sunday by two juveniles as 
he was walking in the 2100 block of B Street at 9:30 p.m. Daniel Marz of La 
Verne was approached by two males, described as 14 or 15 years old, who asked 
for his wallet. Marz fought with the juveniles and one of them stabbed him in 
the leg. Marz's wallet was later found, missing its money -- $4. No arrests 
have been made and the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: A 19-year-old man suspected of drunk driving was arrested Monday 
after he allegedly hit a bicyclist. Juan Horta of Monrovia drove his car 
through a stop sign at 50 m.p.h., police said. The driver hit the back tire of 
a bicycle and knocked the rider, a 28-year-old Monrovia man, off his bike. The 
victim sustained minor injuries to his right leg and shoulder, police said. 
Horta is in the city jail pending filing of felony hit and run and felony drunk 
driving charges, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: A Monrovia man was arrested on suspicion of recklessly discharging a 
firearm Friday after he allegedly fired six shots in a home in the 100 block of 
E. Cherry Street. Ricky Ricks, 28, was visiting the home of Preston Rogers, 26, 
when an argument broke out about 11 a.m., police said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: A 22-year-old man who was shot Sunday night died at Huntington 
Memorial Hospital early Monday, police said. Michael Boyd was found with 
several gunshot wounds outside an apartment complex at 830 N. El Molino Ave. at 
11:30 p.m. Sunday, police said. Boyd reportedly lived at 838 N. El Molino Ave., 
the apartment complex next door. Police believe Boyd may have been visiting 
friends to use the telephone in an apartment in the complex. An investigation 
is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: Unknown people in a car shot at another car in the 700 block of 
Lincoln Avenue on Sunday but injured no one. Two people, one of whom is a 
juvenile, were riding in the car that was shot at, police said. The victims are 
reluctant to talk, said police, who believe the incident is gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: A 10-year-old boy died Friday when the family truck in which he was 
riding crashed on a freeway transition road, highway patrol officers said. 
Michael Rodriguez died at the scene of the accident, which occurred about 5 
a.m. on the connector from the westbound San Bernardino Freeway to the 
northbound Foothill Freeway, officers said. His parents and younger sister, who 
were also in the truck, suffered minor injuries. The family was headed from 
their Fontana home to Pismo Beach for the Memorial Day weekend, officers said. 
The boy and his sister were apparently riding in a camper in the bed of the 
pickup, which was pulling a small trailer carrying two off-road motorcycles. 
The father, Miguel Rodriguez, who was driving, apparently lost control as he 
attempted to change lanes and the truck overturned, police said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; OFFICIALS STUDY FINANCES OF SISTER-CITY PANEL

 City officials are investigating the financial records of the Sierra Leone 
Sister City committee, which several years ago established relations between 
Inglewood and Bo, a city in the West African country. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 4 to 1 last week to examine the records. Councilman 
Garland Hardeman, who is on the sister-city committee, opposed the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul Eckles called for an investigation after a delegation of Bo 
officials, bound for Inglewood last month, were left stranded at an airport in 
Sierra Leone. The delegation was led to believe the city would pay for the trip 
and that airline tickets would be waiting for them at the airport.  
</P>
<P>
 "At a minimum, this sister-city relationship has become a major embarrassment 
to the city of Inglewood," Eckles wrote in a memo submitted to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckles' suspicions were further raised when the sister-city committee refused 
to release its financial statements.  
</P>
<P>
 The investigation will center on the fund-raising activities of the committee 
and its president, Art Davis, according to the memo. Davis said that the 
committee is gathering its financial statements, but the process will take two 
or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the Bo delegation waited at the airport for more than a 
week for the tickets. The incident may have been a miscommunication among 
Davis, Bo city officials and Richard Harris, an Orange County businessman who 
agreed to pay for the trip but later withdrew his support, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no committee expenses were paid with Inglewood funds, an 
investigation is needed to determine if committee members were involved in any 
illegal activities, said Assistant City Manager Norman Cravens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow somebody got the city deeply involved with something we didn't have 
anything to do with; now we're trying to extricate ourselves from it," Cravens 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman said that any investigation into the committee's activities is 
politically motivated and an "African witch hunt."  
</P>
<P>
 Hardeman plans to present a full report before the council meeting on Tuesday.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA CANYON; AT 100, SCHOOL IS A RUSTIC REMINDER OF 
L.A.'S HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 All that remains of Angelina Marquez Olivera's childhood in the rustic Santa 
Monica Canyon of 70 years ago is the fragrance of jasmine blossoms, the 
family's cemetery plot and the schoolhouse. And her memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miss (Theresa) Slatten, the principal, gave me my first job -- clapping 
erasers and cleaning the blackboard," said Marquez, who is the oldest living 
descendant of Pascual Marquez, who donated the land for Canyon Elementary 
School. "She gave me a shiny nickel and a kiss on the cheek. I was so happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Olivera still lives in the house where she was born in 1916, next to Canyon 
Elementary, the site of the second-oldest school building in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1894 and still in use as a library, the one-room schoolhouse is the 
focal point of the school's centennial celebration, which started with alumni 
visits in May and will continue with a barbecue on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The land on which the school sits was part of a 6,656-acre Mexican land grant 
known as Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, which was given to Francisco Marquez and 
Ysidro Reyes in 1839. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, said Betty Lou Young of the Pacific Palisades Historical Society, 
those who got gifts of land from the Mexican government "were people who had 
served the government or well-born men who had connections." Marquez had lived 
on the land since 1831.  
</P>
<P>
 Once including much of Santa Monica Canyon and the Pacific Palisades, the land 
was subdivided in the 1880s, but the property on Entrada Drive and San Lorenzo 
Street, where the family cemetery is located, has been continuously owned and 
occupied by members of the Marquez family. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to school at Canyon Elementary in the 1930s was a remarkable experience, 
said alumnus Masaru Matsumura, who visited the school in May. "There were no 
houses, no nothing around here. I used to run through the corn fields," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The original schoolhouse, built on Sycamore Road in 1894, was used until the 
1920s, when two wood bungalow classrooms were added to accommodate the growing 
population of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 By then the school had moved to what is now Amalfi Drive, where the old 
schoolhouse served as a multipurpose center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was used as an auditorium, but we had sewing classes there," said Jane 
Waterman Blackwell, 75, a graduate who still lives in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The old schoolhouse had a belfry, and today, the students ring the bell at the 
end of the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attended the school in the 1930s have vivid recollections of teacher 
Verna Webber, who taught reading, writing, arithmetic and more. "Miss Webber 
taught us to play tennis, how to waltz and fox-trot. She taught us the high 
jump, and the hurdles," said Harry Gesner, an architect who lives in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "When George Gershwin died (in 1937), she was very upset," Gesner said. "So 
she played 'Rhapsody in Blue' on the piano." 
</P>
<P>
 The memories of historian Ernest Marquez, another descendant of the land grant 
family, are bittersweet. His mother and stepfather, who lived on property next 
to the school, were forced to move in 1954 when the school district took over 
the land in an eminent domain proceeding.  
</P>
<P>
 "With the money she got, she couldn't afford to buy, so she was forced out of 
the canyon," Marquez said. The family relocated to Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining Marquez land grant acres were sold to a developer in 1979.  
</P>
<P>
 But the old schoolhouse remains, recently restored and painted a soft yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I drive through the canyon my eyes always go to the school," 
Gesner said. "It would be sorely missed if they tore it down. It should always 
be preserved." CAROL CHASTANG

<TEXT>
<P>
 ALHAMBRA UNIFIED: Monterey Highlands Elementary School won the grand and 
second prizes in the 1994 California Youth Energy Award for Project EARTH 
(Environmental Awareness Research Through Hands-on) activities, a 15-year 
tradition at the school. Seventh-graders Christine Chau, Jacqueline Law, 
Candace Gee and Amy Tsai traveled to Sacramento to receive the award on May 13. 
The students organized a toy recycling drive to benefit child earthquake 
victims and they also planted trees on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAREMONT UNIFIED: The school board tentatively decided to eliminate two 
part-time school nurse positions. A committee of community members and school 
district administrators will review the services those nurses provide and 
determine if there are alternate ways to deliver them. For example, teachers 
could give health education lessons that nurses now teach, or local 
optometrists could conduct vision screening. The school board will review the 
findings in a month and decide whether to cut the positions. Pay and benefits 
for the two jobs cost $84,000. 
</P>
<P>
 DUARTE UNIFIED: Gov. Pete Wilson appointed special education teacher Marina 
Tse to the California State Special Education Commission. Tse has worked in 
Duarte since 1977 and also taught adult education part-time for Los Angeles 
Unified. She serves as an adviser to the Chinese American Education Assn. and 
is co-chair of the San Gabriel Valley Multi-Cultural Community Assn. She is the 
only Asian on the commission and hopes to investigate how minority students are 
evaluated for special education. 
</P>
<P>
 EL MONTE UNIFIED: A group of students from Kranz Intermediate School was 
selected from more than 1,300 entries as Western Regional Finalist in the 1994 
Noxema Extraordinary Teen Awards for its "Cougar Pride Campaign." The students 
planted 500 trees and shrubs in and around the school, painted over graffiti on 
school walls and repainted school benches and trash cans. The group won $2,500 
for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA UNIFIED: Five Pasadena teachers received $2,000 each as winners of 
the Rotary Club's 1994 Annual Teacher of Excellence awards. The winners are: 
Yvonne L. Davis of Alexander Hamilton Elementary, Jane Lambert of Thomas 
Jefferson Elementary, Ani K. Simonian of Webster Elementary, Sandy Bustion of 
Woodrow Wilson Middle School and Michael Haussler of Marshall High School. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSEMEAD UNIFIED: The school board approved a technology partnership between 
Muscatel Middle School and Cal State Los Angeles. The Exploring Technology 
Program will be a school-community technology lab involving students and 
parents. Seventh- and eighth-graders will develop skills in computer-aided 
design, drafting, animation, robotics, aerospace engineering, broadcast 
communication and laser technology. Parents will be offered career assessment 
and hands-on lab experience in the evenings through the district's adult 
school. The program will begin in September.

PASADENA; COUNCIL OKS CONTRACT FOR PIPELINE CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted to pay a consultant up to $3.7 million to engineer 
and manage construction of a pipeline to bring reclaimed water from a Glendale 
plant into Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The council awarded the contract to Montgomery Watson Americas. The cost of 
the system, which includes pumps, is estimated at $26.4 million, said spokesman 
George Morrow. The council must arrange financing, possibly by issuing bonds, 
and award a construction contract before reclaimed water flows into Pasadena in 
spring, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the system is built, Pasadena expects to satisfy about 10% of its needs 
with reclaimed water, which is safe for irrigation and manufacturing uses but 
not for drinking.

SOUTH BAY COVER STORY; DANGEROUS GROUND; AS EPA HUNTS FOR SOURCE OF MAJOR DDT 
CONTAMINATION, RESIDENTS WORRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, federal officials spoke cautiously about the white chunks unearthed 
in a South Bay back yard. This mysterious material, they said, could be 
something as harmless as construction debris. 
</P>
<P>
 But just to make sure, they shipped a few clumps to a laboratory for testing. 
And on the May morning after the results came back, the white chunks were 
suddenly a hot news story. 
</P>
<P>
 Television vans jammed the alley leading to the excavation site. Reporters 
took turns holding up a vial of the material as cameras zoomed in. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a startling find: DDT in virtually solid form had been dug from the 
yard of an unsuspecting West 204th Street couple, and no one -- not the 
residents, not their neighbors, not even the experts at the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency -- could say where it came from. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary. Stuff like this should not be happening. This is the 20th 
Century," said Robin Hatch, 30, a mother of two who lives only three doors from 
where the DDT was found. What makes this environmental tale so riveting is that 
it defies an easy explanation. Chunks of DDT as big as bowling balls simply are 
not supposed to be buried in yards where one resident grew tomatoes and another 
held family barbecues. In a society that has grown ever more wary of pesticides 
-- even to the point of diligently scrubbing its organic vegetables -- the 
back-yard discovery on West 204th Street seems like an American nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials say they have no evidence that the chunks came from a DDT 
factory once located nearby. Yet the drama is a disconcerting reminder that 
DDT's legacy looms large in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, federal officials and consultants have been quietly measuring the 
DDT content of neighborhood soil, attic dust, ground water, storm drains, and 
even crabs and fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission: to analyze the effects of the DDT manufacturing plant operated 
by Montrose Chemical Corp. from 1947 to 1982 on Normandie Avenue, just east of 
Torrance in the Harbor Gateway neighborhood of Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The task resembles some long but engrossing detective novel, with numerous 
plot twists and many chapters still unwritten. It illustrates the Gargantuan 
job that government agencies, companies and residents confront as they try to 
identify and clean up industrial pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose became one of the world's leading DDT producers in an era when the 
white powder was hailed as a magic potion. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Americans' enthusiasm for the pesticide cooled, Montrose's fortunes 
faltered. Today, the former factory site is one of 1,200 on the federal 
Superfund list of the most hazardous toxic-waste sites in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Its impact has been felt far beyond the 13-acre site, now a vacant lot. 
Thousands of pounds of DDT are trapped in sediment inside a local sewer line, 
and still more pollutes water underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Health experts emphasize that although DDT is a suspected carcinogen and, in 
large doses, can affect the human nervous system, most deposits detected around 
the Montrose site are too small to threaten human health. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, there are only a few routes by which residents could be exposed to 
the DDT, health officials say. Contaminated soil could be eaten by children. 
Adults could consume home-grown produce sprinkled with tainted soil or eat 
DDT-laden eggs laid by back-yard chickens. People could ingest attic dust, 
which experts say is unlikely. Or they could eat DDT-contaminated fish, which 
is one reason the state recommends against eating white croaker caught at 
places such as White's Point and Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Government experts say they have no evidence that such exposure has caused 
health problems in the area. Still, some residents wonder if the pesticide 
could be the source of the rashes, nausea, dizziness and aching joints that 
they say are prevalent in the West 204th Street neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring of public concern in recent weeks has lent new urgency to the 
ongoing federal studies of how DDT affected the South Bay environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose's neighbors say they just want the government to hurry in its cleanup 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just hurting human beings. It's hurting our planet," said Hatch. "I 
want them to have whoever is responsible to clean it up."  
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the 14-year-old federal Superfund program is supposed to be 
exactly that: to pinpoint which companies polluted a site and require them to 
investigate and, as much as possible, finance the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 At Montrose, the scope of that project is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Montrose and its insurance companies have spent at least $17 million 
for studies and initial remediation, and that's only the beginning. A Montrose 
study estimates that cleanup costs for ground water alone could range from $30 
million to $359 million. And although the Montrose site was first proposed as a 
Superfund candidate in 1984, an overall cleanup plan has yet to begin or even 
be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose says it broke no laws and notes that industrial practices changed 
over the past several decades. Throughout, the firm did its best to operate 
within industry norms and follow legal requirements, said attorney Karl S. Lytz 
of Latham & Watkins, a law firm representing Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, despite years of costly studies and legal haggling, no one can say 
when the South Bay's DDT inheritance will be cleaned up for good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, some people talked about DDT with the reverence usually 
reserved for penicillin. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, DDT was the chemical that saved millions of lives by curbing 
insect-borne diseases such as yellow fever and malaria. It preserved farmers' 
crops by killing foraging bugs. The Swiss scientist who discovered DDT's 
pesticide potential in 1939 would later win a Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 People barely noticed when the Montrose factory opened soon after World War 
II. One man who worked there briefly in the late 1940s says that newly mixed 
DDT was poured into a large, shallow tub. Then he would climb atop the hardened 
DDT, chopping it with a hoe-like tool into transportable pieces. Unlike the 
respirator-wearing cleanup crew on West 204th Street, the man saw no reason to 
don a mask or protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, DDT was the big thing. It killed bugs. It was great," recalled 
the man, who said he worked at Montrose for only a few months and does not 
think he incurred health problems. He did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT's downfall was its tenacity -- it stays in the soil for decades -- and its 
tendency to travel through the food chain, building up in the fat of animals 
that eat DDT-contaminated food. Scientists discovered birds laying eggs with 
shells so fragile that they shattered before hatching, and they blamed DDT.  
</P>
<P>
 Even after DDT was banned for most uses in the United States in 1972, Montrose 
continued making it for export to Africa, India and elsewhere. By the late 
1970s, the South Bay plant was the only American DDT plant still operating. It 
finally shut down in June, 1982, and the building was torn down soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the environmental drama was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators concluded that rainwater had carried some DDT from the plant 
into the storm drains. Montrose installed an asphalt cap over much of the 
property, and testing continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The site officially attained Superfund status in 1989. By then, monitoring 
wells had detected ground water tainted with monochlorobenzene, a chemical used 
in DDT manufacturing that can cause liver and kidney damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing went on, unnoticed by many residents living nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the trouble started on West 204th Street, and DDT again became a 
household word in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost by happenstance that DDT was spotted in the back-yard soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA was screening soil from 14 yards along West 204th Street to make sure 
it was not tainted by chemicals from the proposed Del Amo Superfund site to the 
north, where a synthetic rubber factory once operated. 
</P>
<P>
 With Montrose in mind, an agency official decided to add a test for DDT. When 
the tests came back last winter, Del Amo chemicals were barely detectable -- 
but DDT showed up in samples from two back yards on the street's north side. 
More tests, taken beneath the surface in the two yards, found the pesticide at 
45 times the level considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened residents formed a committee and fought successfully to have 25 
families temporarily moved to hotels while federal crews removed toxic soil and 
took it to a hazardous waste landfill in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup was supposed to take only two weeks, but a glitch developed May 6 when 
workers uncovered the first of the DDT chunks. In response, EPA officials 
agreed two weeks ago to keep residents in temporary housing for up to six 
months during an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The DDT deposits appear to be scattered in fill soil that goes as deep as 
seven feet in one back yard. Investigators now hope to trace where the fill 
came from -- and determine if it extends under homes to the east of the two 
excavated yards. 
</P>
<P>
 That probe, which could last through the summer, will help decide how much 
cleanup is needed and if residents should be permanently relocated. That would 
be an unusual step -- taken only once in EPA's four-state Western region -- but 
one that the agency has promised to study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't necessarily think there's an acute health risk out there," said 
Nancy Lindsay, chief of the Superfund enforcement branch for the EPA regional 
office in San Francisco. Although residents can choose to return to West 204th 
Street during the investigation, gardening or even allowing children to play in 
their own back yards is not advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four weeks after the discovery of the first DDT chunks, the EPA says it 
is still perplexed about how they got there. 
</P>
<P>
 Montrose's attorney says he is not aware that the DDT came from Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea of where the material came from," attorney Lytz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the uncertainty, the federal government is not charging Montrose 
for the back-yard cleanup. The cost to date: more than $500,000.  
</P>
<P>
 For one week in April, a team of investigators in jeans and coveralls followed 
a serpentine route of drains across the South Bay, taking samples. They 
clambered aboard a boat to traverse the Dominguez Channel, gathering water, 
sediment, crabs and fish to test them for pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work marked the start of the first major EPA study of whether DDT 
remains in the storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 That project is just one part of an overall Superfund study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to track all the possible avenues in which the contamination 
could be transported away," said Nancy Woo, EPA's Montrose project manager. The 
effort includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Neighborhood soil. Low levels of DDT were found in some yards and in dust in 
some attics in the 1980s. Because of the discovery on 204th Street and new, 
more stringent EPA standards, the agency has ordered more wide-ranging tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting later this year, surface soil samples will be taken from the yards of 
100 to 300 homes in two areas near Montrose: the north and south sides of West 
204th Street between Normandie and New Hampshire avenues, and in a neighborhood 
farther west between Western Avenue, Del Amo Boulevard, Denker Avenue and West 
205th Street. Dust may be tested in the attics of some homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sewer lines. The EPA has studied the sanitary sewer system because Montrose 
discharged waste water containing DDT into the system between 1953 and 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Tons of DDT are believed to have flowed into the Pacific Ocean through sewer 
outfalls off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Today, as much as 20 square miles of 
the sea floor are contaminated with DDT, which many scientists blame for 
damaging marine and bird life. Montrose's attorney disputes claims that most of 
the offshore DDT came from its factory, saying that DDT was widely used in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 (The federal government initiated an ocean pollution lawsuit against Montrose 
and other companies in 1990. A trial is not expected until the late 1990s. One 
facet of the complex case was settled in 1992 when a long list of cities and 
special districts -- said by companies to have released toxic substances 
themselves -- agreed to help pay to restore coastal waters.) 
</P>
<P>
 As much as 21 tons of DDT are believed to be lodged within a tar-like 
substance inside one sewer line under Normandie Avenue. When a new sewer line 
is completed later this year, cleanup crews are scheduled to remove the 
DDT-laden sediment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ground water. The discovery of contaminated water underground is provoking 
deep concern among EPA experts. Montrose placed liquids such as 
monochlorobenzene in a large unlined pit from 1947 to 1970. Such pits were 
common practice, and Montrose is not known to have broken laws at the time, Woo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contamination has seeped into two subterranean layers that contain ground 
water not used for drinking. A monitoring well has detected monochlorobenzene 
in a deeper ground-water layer that does supply drinking water, but that spot 
is more than two miles away from a drinking-water intake, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the cleanup plan is that DDT, which does not dissolve easily in 
water, does dissolve in the solvent monochlorobenzene. A mixture of DDT and the 
solvent is lodged in the uppermost ground-water layers. The mixture moves 
extremely slowly through the porous layers, much as molasses might move through 
a sponge. 
</P>
<P>
 The substance poses a dilemma because there is no technology capable of 
removing it, officials say. So scientists are studying whether to leave it in 
place, ringed by wells to prevent it from traveling underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a so-called pump-and-treat system may be used to remove 
monochlorobenzene from other tainted ground water areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is painstakingly slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about how long it would take you to clean up (an) oil rag just by 
dipping it in water," Woo said. And, she added, suppose the rag cannot be 
cleaned with soap or wrung out. 
</P>
<P>
 The tainted ground water is found so deep that cleanup crews cannot reach it 
with excavation equipment. Instead, the dirty water is extracted through a 
well, treated to remove contaminants and pumped back underground. Studies show 
the process could take 30 to 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For many neighbors, an underground soup of monochlorobenzene and talk of 
60-year timelines are simply too colossal to dwell upon. Much more immediate -- 
and more alarming -- are the white chunks of DDT. For many, that simple image 
has poisoned the sense of security that once characterized their neighborhood. 
Now they worry less about cleanup schemes than about how to avoid returning to 
West 204th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunia Ponce can vividly describe the small home she left behind in April when 
she was relocated to a Torrance hotel.

 She bought the two-bedroom house three years ago for $155,000, remodeled the

 High levels of DDT have been detected in the soil behind two homes on the 
north side of West 204th Street, prompting a federal cleanup and the temporary 
relocation of about 90 residents from the street between Budlong Avenue and 
Catalina Street. The source of the DDt remains unknown, but its discovery has 
reawakened neighbors' concerns about Montrose Chemical Corp., a former DDT 
manufacturer once located nearby on Normandie Avenue.

 For 50 years, three generations of the Litvak family have run the Santa Monica 
Homeopathic Drug Co. out of the same narrow storefront on 4th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged the building so severely that it will be 
under repair for up to six months. So the Litvaks, their shelves overcrowded 
with doses of animal, vegetable and mineral substances even before the quake, 
have moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really outgrown the spot, and earthquake repairs made (the move) 
necessary," said Bob Litvak. His parents, Norman and Mary, both 82, own the 
pharmacy, one of the nation's oldest and busiest specializing in homeopathic 
remedies.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTWOOD; 2 LUCKY BREAKS LED HIM TO MEDICAL SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doctors come to the medical field by a variety of paths, but Bret Batchelor 
literally fell into the profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Working as a roofer in 1989, Batchelor took a tumble off a two-story residence 
and broke both wrists. 
</P>
<P>
 Fascinated by how his orthopedic surgeon treated his injuries, Batchelor 
became friends with his doctor, who encouraged him to return to college to 
fulfill the science requirements needed for medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Batchelor, 30, will graduate from UCLA on Tuesday as a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time of my accident I had no aspiration to be anything in particular," 
said Batchelor, a former bodybuilder and football player from Orange County. 
"If it wasn't for the fall, I'd probably still be goofing off." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the costs and pressures of medical school, Batchelor labored 
with another burden: four young children. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife had a daughter from a previous marriage, and during final exams his 
first year, the couple had fraternal twins. Two years later, another boy was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 Many medical students wait until their later years to have children -- after 
the rigors of school, residencies and internships have passed -- but not 
Batchelor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a family was more of a motivation than being single," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Batchelor's wife, Erin, who works as a paralegal, said there were 
some hectic moments during the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like at every birth he had some big test," she said. "And during 
one rotation he was on call for two months -- he'd come home for five (or) six 
hours of sleep and then be gone for two days. But once he sets his mind to 
something, he gets it done." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the month, Batchelor will begin a five-year residency at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in the orthopedic surgery department. After that he 
owes four years to the Navy, which provided money for his schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 After short stints as a bartender, waiter and roofer, Batchelor remains 
gratified that his initial misfortune caused a career switch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful I've got this new job," he said. "I need it to pay for all these 
kids." ADRIAN MAHER

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COVER STORY; HOW TO START A NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So you hardly know your neighbors and you want to change all that, build a 
sense of community and camaraderie? 
</P>
<P>
 You're not alone.Neighborhoods USA is a national nonprofit organization formed 
in 1975 to build and strengthen neighborhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Benedict, a member of the board of directors for the association, 
offers the following tips for starting your own neighborhood group. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Identify why you want to start a neighborhood group. Crime prevention, 
beautification of the community and a need to unite and empower residents are 
three common reasons for starting an association. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Start canvassing the neighborhood for members to join the association and 
to find out what issues are important in the community. A priority should be 
working to build lasting friendships in the community and organizing the 
neighborhood into almost a family unit. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Hold a big meeting. Policy should be established at this first 
get-together: Will the association have officers -- a president, vice president 
and treasurer? How will the association raise funds? How and where will 
meetings be conducted? Will someone volunteer to mail out agendas? 
</P>
<P>
 4. Once the association has been formed, find out if your city has a 
neighborhood association outreach office. This office usually acts as a liaison 
between city government and the associations and can provide helpful hints on a 
variety of topics, including the best way to approach the city council. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Once the association is on its feet and growing, go national. Contact 
groups such as Neighborhoods USA and begin attending conferences and meetings 
to discover new ways of solving community problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call Benedict at (818) 351-1203 or write: Neighborhoods 
USA, Mid City Station, Box 307, Dayton, Ohio 45402.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTCHESTER; AIM OF HOUSING WORKSHOP IS CO-MANAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This week, 62 residents of housing projects in Watts and Mar Vista are taking 
part in a workshop aimed at giving them more control over where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by Loyola Marymount University and offered through the Nickerson 
Gardens Resident Management Corp., this week's three-day workshop is intended 
to prepare the residents for community jobs with the goal that eventually they 
will co-manage their projects with the city's housing authority.  
</P>
<P>
 "With experience, they can run these facilities at a lower price and can 
provide jobs for the community," said Loyola Marymount professor of management 
David Boje, who helped begin the program three years ago after a visit to 
Nickerson Gardens. "It can also be a way out." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the first training program, seven residents of Nickerson 
Gardens are now employed as gardeners, maintenance workers or typists at the 
projects. Though there are only two positions currently open in that community, 
Boje said this year's workshop will aid in creating a temporary employment 
agency for Nickerson Gardens residents, who make up the bulk of the workshop's 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the agency, residents will be able to work for various city 
departments on a short-term basis if regular city employees are sick or on 
vacation, or if the departments need more personnel. Boje says workshop 
participants will also be given access to a 12-week training program for those 
who want to start their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 To further help would-be entrepreneurs, Boje envisions enlisting an 
eight-member team of Peace Corps volunteers experienced in helping economically 
disadvantaged communities. They would provide training and follow-up in 
"micro-enterprise" for two years, he said, and might also live in the housing 
projects.  
</P>
<P>
 The three-day workshop was scheduled to run from June 1 to 3 and conclude with 
a graduation ceremony Friday afternoon at the university. Residents of the 
Hacienda Village, Imperial Courts and Jordan Downs housing projects were also 
expected to attend the workshop. SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; A CITY'S CHOICE; SUPPORTERS OF THE PLAN TO REDO SANTA 
MONICA'S CIVIC CENTER SAY IT IS VISIONARY ANDNECESSARY. OPPONENTS SAY IT MEANS 
THE LOSS OF OPEN SPACE AND UNFAIRLY FAVORS THE RAND CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cities seldom have the luxury of reinventing themselves these days. It's hard 
enough for most to stay afloat. The exception on the Westside is Santa Monica, 
a cutting-edge city committed to fighting urban ennui -- even in tight economic 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs are everywhere. Trendy Main Street and Montana Avenue. The reopened and 
redeveloping Santa Monica Pier. And especially the Third Street Promenade, 
which went from blighted to bloated with customers almost overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the forces of change want to remake the Civic Center, a part of the city 
that looks as though it's stuck in a 1950s time warp. And next Tuesday, Santa 
Monica voters will pass judgment on the proposal. Two ballot measures -- D and 
E -- offer voters a plan to revamp the area by turning thumbs up or down on a 
zoning blueprint called the Civic Center Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the future of the heart of a city that has become one of the Los 
Angeles area's favorite playgrounds. The 45-acre Civic Center site lies between 
Colorado and Pico boulevards, Ocean Avenue and 4th Street. It is home to Santa 
Monica's City Hall, county courthouse and Civic Auditorium.  
</P>
<P>
 With more than 60% of its surface devoted to parking lots, a trademark of 
1950s urban planning, the Civic Center area stands as a paean to the 
automobile. City planning officials call the area isolated and underused, an 
unnatural barrier between northern and southern Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to 26 acres of public land, the Civic Center area includes a 
15.8-acre parcel to the west that belongs to the RAND Corp. Part of the RAND 
property is the international think tank's headquarters, which would be 
expanded under the civic center plan. The rest is boarded-up investment 
property along Ocean Avenue that RAND bought decades ago and is now seeking to 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly five years of study and public hearings, a vision for the area 
was finally put down on paper and passed unanimously by the City Council in 
November. That was no small feat, given the council's near-perpetual 
disagreement on development matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Plan proponents promise that their design scheme will transform the woebegone 
area into a vibrant town square for the 21st Century, with parks, ponds and 
pedestrian walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the reclamation of an urban ecology that was destroyed in the '50s," 
said plan supporter Frank Gruber, who lives in Ocean Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Said City Councilman Paul Rosenstein: "I see the new Civic Center as the jewel 
in the crown of Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the proposal, who range from state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica) to Green Party activist Mike Feinstein, gathered the 6,557 valid 
signatures needed to make Tuesday's referendum vote possible. They see a future 
more akin to "Blade Runner" than Walden Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the opponents contend that the redevelopment plan allows the 
RAND Corp. overly generous development rights that could lead to increased 
traffic congestion and air pollution. The city, they say, should acquire 
RAND-owned property -- using eminent domain, if necessary -- to provide more 
open space and ocean views for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said RAND should build a new headquarters on property it has slated 
for office buildings south of its current corporate offices. The present 
headquarters, he said, could be leveled and turned over to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council's redevelopment plan for Santa Monica's Civic Center is 
nothing more than a Trojan horse for RAND's scheme to maximize their property 
rights," said John Bodin, another leader of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone agrees that the Civic Center could stand some improvement. Its 
vast expanse of asphalt would look ugly anywhere, but especially so in light of 
its proximity to the natural beauty of the coastline. The buildings themselves 
are not much help. Despite the charm of the Art Deco City Hall, structures are 
scattered chaotically, with no unifying theme. The area is notable for its lack 
of warmth, and the only people to be found there are usually getting into and 
out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 What are voters being asked to consider? 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Center Specific Plan is a 126-page document that sets out an overall 
design and zoning scheme for the area. In all, the public and private expansion 
would add up to 1.1 million square feet of new development -- one third more 
than is there now. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's design focal point is a 1.6-acre public square in front of City 
Hall. A new east-west street running from Ocean Avenue to 4th Street and 
offering easy access to the Santa Monica Freeway is suggested to relieve beach 
traffic that now clogs Colorado Avenue and Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan establishes limits on building heights and density, among other 
restrictions, and sets forth anticipated parking requirements. Any projects 
undertaken as part of the plan, however, are still subject to a complete city 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated cost of upgrading roads, sidewalks and other infrastructure for 
the new center is $27.1 million. RAND has agreed to pay $14.9 million of that. 
The rest will be funded by revenue bonds and monies received from the county 
for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders say the Civic Center redevelopment plan is fiscally prudent. It 
allows for only one new city building -- a police headquarters that could be 
built behind City Hall on what is now a parking lot. If voters approve the 
Civic Center plan, construction of a new station would be financed later by a 
separate bond issue, which also would need voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall itself, with its 1930s Art Deco design, will remain as is, as will 
the classic 1950s-style Civic Auditorium and the courthouse. But the buildings 
will be connected by landscaping, walkways, benches and other park features 
that might include an ocean-view tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major new structure besides the police station would be a six-level, 
above-ground, 1,000-space parking structure that would be built between the 
courthouse and 4th Street. Provisions for expansion of the courthouse are in 
the Civic Center plan, but they cannot be carried out because of state budget 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what is now the parking lot between 4th Street and the Civic 
Auditorium would be devoted to a new six-acre park. In all, the plan provides 
for about 11 acres of park area. 
</P>
<P>
 West of Main Street, RAND's existing office complex would be expanded by up to 
200,000 square feet, mostly to add meeting and conference space. Across the 
street from the courthouse, RAND hopes to build 350 units of housing, a third 
of them affordable to low- and moderate-income earners. And on Ocean Avenue 
between Pacific Shores Hotel and RAND headquarters, the think tank would be 
allowed to construct 250,000 square feet of office space with 50,000 square 
feet of ground-floor retail uses. 
</P>
<P>
 This office space is by far the most controversial part of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although RAND, a nonprofit organization, claims that it needs to develop the 
property to ensure its future financial stability, project opponents say the 
last thing the city needs is more offices and the traffic they bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, traffic estimates are a key point of contention. Opponents, 
pointing to the city's estimate that the new center would generate 23,000 new 
car trips a day, say the result will be gridlock and more air pollution. (One 
worker driving to and from work each day equals two car trips.) 
</P>
<P>
 Project opponents are not mollified by the city's contention that timed 
traffic signals and rerouting of cars around crowded areas will actually 
improve the traffic flow in and around the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear, however, how effectively the projects foes will be able to make 
their reservations known to voters. After bucking the odds to get the measure 
on the ballot, they will probably lack the money to send out a single citywide 
campaign mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, that's because their key benefactor, state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica), is focusing his attention and resources on his bid to become governor. 
In the early stages of Civic Center opposition, Hayden called his own meeting 
and blasted City Council members -- usually his allies -- for selling out the 
"heart of the city" to RAND. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden even stood at supermarkets last December gathering signatures for the 
referendum and questioning why a company so closely linked with the military 
should be included in the Civic Center. He recommends that the city offer RAND 
a land swap, so the think tank would move elsewhere, leaving its Civic Center 
property for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND, the city's second-largest employer, has owned its land since the early 
'50s. It has been trying with mixed success -- to live down its Cold War 
reputation as a cog in the country's military machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contend that opposition to the plan is thinly disguised RAND-bashing.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is they don't want RAND here," said Herman Rosenstein, a 
community activist who supports the plan. "I'm not going to fight the Vietnam 
War all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Civic Center opponents concede that without Hayden's full attention, they are 
now more than ever waging a David versus Goliath campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 "We tell voters to bring their slingshots to the polls," quipped John Bodin, 
spokesman for the opponents' group, called Citizens for a Better Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's supporters, like its opponents, are underfunded -- except, that is, 
for RAND. With its zoning rights at stake, RAND is wielding a heavy checkbook 
in a separate campaign to get the plan approved. 
</P>
<P>
 RAND so far has spent $146,000 on the effort, said spokeswoman Iao Katagiri. 
Volunteers from RAND -- some responding to a written request for help from 
company President James Thomson -- have set up a phone bank and have been 
calling voters since May 1. As of Monday, they had reached 6,000 residents and 
left 11,000 messages on answering machines. The RAND volunteers, including 
employees and their family members, are also out knocking on doors. 
</P>
<P>
 A RAND-financed mail campaign, focused on public safety, features messages 
from Santa Monica Police Officers Assn. President Steve Brackett. He calls upon 
voters to approve the plan as a first step toward the construction of a new 
police facility with a modern communications system, pointing out that the 
city's 911 system collapsed for several hours after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the plan say this argument is fallacious, countering out that the 
city could build a new police station without a Civic Center plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we're no match for RAND (in campaign funds)," Bodin said. "We're 
going to have to rely on the intelligence of Santa Monica voters to see through 
their illusory public safety campaign."

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: TAKE A BREAK. IT'S TEATIME IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teatime in Torrance. Next to a Fuddrucker's no less. All right, so maybe it 
doesn't compare to high tea at Windsor Castle, but Crickett's Tea Room and Cafe 
in Rolling Hills Plaza in Torrance offers a delightful respite from the bustle 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1991 by Elizabeth Welch and Gus Velarde, Crickett's has expanded 
from a cramped three-table store selling teas and teapots to a brightly 
decorated room that can seat up to 80 people. Elizabeth fills the role of the 
charming host so naturally that you might be surprised to learn her last job 
was shipping containers. It was only after meeting Velarde, who owned the 
Sidewalk Cafe in Palos Verdes Estates, that she became interested in the 
restaurant business. 
</P>
<P>
 Crickett's high tea ($10.50) includes a cup of the soup of the day, a small 
plate of the salad of the day, a croissant sandwich (your choice of chicken 
salad, egg salad, ham or roast beef), a scone with Devonshire cream, strawberry 
jam and lemon curd, dessert and, of course, English tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Crickett's also offers a light lunch menu. One of the highlights is the French 
Moroccan salad ($5.95), which is made with orange slices, pitted dates, toasted 
coconut and almonds, topped with a poppy-seed dressing. The Oriental chicken 
salad ($5.95) features chicken breast, bean sprouts, grapes, snow peas and 
crisp rice noodles. Pasta primavera salad ($5.95) is a medley of broccoli, 
button mushrooms, zucchini, cauliflower, carrots and chicken breast. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiches ($6.50) include honey-glazed ham, top round of beef and sliced 
turkey breast served on a French roll, rye or a croissant. 
</P>
<P>
 Crickett's plans to add a small English-style pub next to the tearoom soon.

ELECTION: TRAFFIC AND REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a member of the board of directors of the Ocean Park Community 
Organization, a co-chair of its traffic committee and a homeowner on 4th 
Street, I am terribly frustrated by the prospect of increased traffic problems 
that will occur if the proposed Civic Center redevelopment is passed June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 I speak for many other 4th Street residents who share my concern.Traffic 
counts on our street already exceed the amounts designated by city traffic and 
engineering by between 25% and 45%. Daily volumes currently run between 13,500 
and 19,800 car trips per day, a frightening amount for a narrow, heavily 
populated residential street with elementary schools, elderly citizens and 
pedestrian and bicycle traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Center Plan claims an additional 24,000-plus car trips will be 
generated with the new development and that this will have no negative effect 
on existing conditions. Who would blame us for being skeptical? Are they 
thinking that all this traffic will enter and exit the area from the freeway?  
</P>
<P>
 When does the quality of life and safety of a city's citizens become at least 
as important as the city's ability to move traffic quickly and efficiently down 
its streets? A "no" vote on Propositions D and E would at least send this plan 
back to the drawing board.

HISTORY: PRESERVING MIRACLE MILE BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've lived in the Miracle Mile district all my life; my Mom grew up there, too 
("What Price History," May 22). Granted, we do not have buildings such as the 
Taj Mahal or a showcase designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, but the 1920s buildings 
and apartments are all we have to crow about.It's our architectural heritage! 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow it doesn't surprise me that landlords in the Miracle Mile South 
district desire to tear down these buildings. It appears to be a ritual here in 
Los Angeles to demolish older, quaint buildings to accommodate a parking lot or 
another apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with Denise Robb of the Miracle Mile Action Committee -- if I see one 
more balloon-laden apartment building in the Miracle Mile area, I'll scream. 
And as for landlord Host Beil, who said, "There's no reason for a building from 
1929 to be a historical monument" and "I was born in Germany, and my town goes 
back thousands of years," all I can say is: Sorry, Mr. Beil, we're a few 
thousand years behind. Give us a chance to catch up. Start by preserving the 
buildings in the Miracle Mile South area.

REGIONAL REPORT; ELECTIONS / 36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; GOP RACE BOILS DOWN 
TO WAR OF WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON and DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans Susan Brooks and Ron Florance are running for a seat that 
stretches from Venice to San Pedro, but their battle for the 36th Congressional 
District has been waged almost entirely in their own back yards: the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican contenders live just a few miles apart, share some of the same 
acquaintances and travel in some of the same social circles. But in the 
campaign that culminates with Tuesday's primary, they have been bitter rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, 59, a former Palos Verdes Estates city councilman, is seen by 
opponents as a good-old-boy Republican, financing much of his campaign with the 
real estate riches he made in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, 44, a city councilwoman from Rancho Palos Verdes, is characterized by 
her rival as a political opportunist who had grand designs on higher office 
even before she gained a spot on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's right? It might not matter come November, when the winner will face 
incumbent Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey), who has no opposition in the 
primary. Although the district's voter registration is almost evenly split 
between Republicans and Democrats, Harman has been able to shore up her support 
among top aerospace executives in the district while Brooks and Florence have 
battled. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor of the Brooks-Florence faceoff also should help Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dirtier it is (in the primary), it's always tougher to kiss and make up," 
said Rancho Palos Verdes Mayor Steve Kuykendall, a Republican who is running 
for state Assembly but has not endorsed either congressional candidate. "No 
matter what anyone else says, this stuff is very personal. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Harman, incumbents whose congressional districts encompass parts of 
the South Bay are Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach), Rep. Walter R. Tucker III 
(D-Compton) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles). In Tuesday's vote, Waters 
is unopposed, while Horn and Tucker face underfinanced challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP race to take on Harman in the fall, Brooks and Florance are united 
in their attacks on the incumbent, such as her support of President Clinton's 
budget plan last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the harmony ends there. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has attacked Florance as a tight-fisted millionaire. Her most recent 
allegation: that he may make money off of his own campaign. Florance lent his 
campaign $150,000, but is charging the campaign the prime interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is he running? A campaign or a bank?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance said his lawyers advised him to place the interest rate on the loan. 
"If you make a loan, you charge interest," Florance said. "Otherwise it is not 
a loan." 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause, a group that monitors campaign ethics, says charging interest on 
a campaign loan is legal although many candidates make interest-free loans. 
Besides, Florance said, he doubts that the campaign will ever be able to pay 
him back. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign also points out 40 lawsuits involving Florance or one of his 
businesses over the last nine years. Florance, however, said that he went to 
trial only once, and his side prevailed. He called other lawsuits frivolous, 
often filed against Carriage Realty, the real estate company he owned from 1982 
to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance says he has a list of successful entrepreneurial ventures, dating to 
his youth in Hollywood in the 1940s. As a child, he collected cooking grease 
from neighbors and lugged it to markets, where they paid him wartime ration 
money.  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, as an executive at Proctor & Gamble, his management group tested 
and then introduced what is now Jif peanut butter. He was the top manager at 
two major brokerage firms in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s, he and the 
Ernest W. Hahn Co. developed the Shops at Palos Verdes. The partnership also 
donated land and money to build the Norris Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 In real estate, he displayed a keen sense of timing -- an instinct that has 
made him wealthy. His mansion, a Mediterranean-style villa that overlooks Santa 
Monica Bay, was designed by architect Bob Williams. The view is so spectacular 
that he jokes he will be able to make speeches to the entire district from his 
balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been around the horn," Florance said of his experience. "(Brooks has) 
questioned my ethics, but I have nothing to be ashamed of." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Florance's campaign has turned the attacks around, characterizing 
Brooks as a political opportunist prone to make reckless charges before 
checking the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows . . . how much she has to learn if she goes to Congress," Florance 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance points to Brooks' move up the political ladder. Her switch to the 
Republican Party in 1989, he said, was a politically expedient move in a 
Republican-leaning district. 
</P>
<P>
 On the City Council last fall, Brooks voted against a utility tax to finance 
the upkeep of streets and roads, even though she had earlier supported the 
measure. The tax, she said, should have gone to a vote of the people.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of Brooks' career has been as a special-education teacher in the New 
York, Virginia and Los Angeles public school systems. But she began working on 
civic causes shortly after she and her family moved to Rancho Palos Verdes in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, she fought the closure of Marineland, organized a 
Neighborhood Watch program and revived her neighborhood association. From her 
living room, she looks at one of her first accomplishments: getting stripes 
painted on her street to improve safety. In 1989, she was appointed to the city 
Planning Commission, and was elected to the City Council in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 As a city official, she helped line up private instructors to run the city's 
parks and recreation programs, one of her proudest accomplishments because it 
helped balance the city budget and maintain services. She also co-authored a 
Southern California Assn. of Governments study last year that led to the 
group's support of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This campaign is about real people and how you treat them in real life," she 
said. "I'm carrying their flag, carrying their torch." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates have not wasted any chance to get in digs against each other. 
Florance tells the story that he bought bubble gum from the neighborhood 
shopkeeper for 2 cents and then sold it for 5 cents at school. Brooks called it 
"scalping."  
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who does public relations work for nonprofit groups, is listed on the 
ballot as a businesswoman. Florance says she has never operated a business. 
"This is only out of her house," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Also running in the district are Libertarian Jack Tyler and American 
Independent Party candidate Joseph (Joe) Fields.

THEATER REVIEW; LOW FARCE MEETS HIGH ART IN A FRENETIC 'IMPROVISATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a long, dark silence, the historic red-brick Union Temple Hall in Old 
Town has been transformed into Pasadena's newest live theatrical venue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dramatic New Arts Theater Company signaled its opening and mission with an 
obscure early play by a master of absurdist theater, Eugene Ionesco. 
</P>
<P>
 For its inaugural production in the high-ceilinged, roomy union hall converted 
to a 99-seat theater, the company is staging the French playwright's one-hour, 
one-act intellectual farce "Improvisation" (1956), a kind of "Theater of 
Blood," for those who remember and relish the wonderful Vincent Price movie 
about a stage actor who takes murderous revenge on a gaggle of theater critics. 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance, the late playwright (who died last March and is the author 
of the much more familiar "Rhinoceros" and "Exit the King") casts himself as an 
artiste confronted in his study by a trio of theater scholar/critics who demand 
to be told the subject of the play he's finishing that very moment. Under a 
bombardment of nosy questions, a flustered Ionesco (Seth Panitch) can really 
only tell them his new play's title: "The Shepherd's Chameleon." 
</P>
<P>
 We quickly discern that "Improvisation" is about many things -- writing, 
language, criticism, the nature of theater. But though its verbosity can be 
exhausting, director Gregory Gliedman deftly mixes physicality of performance 
with witty wordplay so that the comic force of the work vies equally with its 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, though a bit frenetic, happily entwines low farce with the 
aspirations of high art. 
</P>
<P>
 The creative process, as both the real Ionesco and the stage-bound character 
Ionesco tell us, defies description. Creativity must speak for itself. Critics 
like those on our stage -- dressed, not coincidentally, in overwrought 
theatrical costumes (Raymond Donahey's gigantic codpiece is a riot) -- intone 
smirking inanities like "stylized realism" and "creative mechanisms" in every 
other breath while analyzing the life out of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Debating Ionesco, the female critic of the group (Alexandra Goodman, costumed 
like a Jazz Age flapper) shouts that "poetry is an enemy of our science." 
</P>
<P>
 Preens another critic (the delightfully arch and simpering John Tracy): "The 
public shouldn't enjoy themselves at the theater -- boredom is entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the play's didactic, blistering coda, Panitch's flustered Ionesco, 
propped up by his sensible broom-wielding housekeeper (Tanya Fogerty as the 
play's singularly sane figure), reels off a scathing tirade against his 
officious intruders. "The playwright," Ionesco declares, "discovers elementary 
truths" while the critics who later will tear his play to pieces deal in 
intellectual sophistry. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ionesco, Panitch is a touch too American in his fresh, youthful good looks 
to suggest the avant-garde intellectual, but he performs with affable panache. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, this is not everybody's cup of theater. But it's a serious 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Improvisation," Dramatic New Arts Theater Company, 42 E. Walnut Ave., 
Pasadena, Thursday through Saturday, 8 p.m., Sunday matinee, 2 p.m. Ends June 
19. $10 to $12. (818) 568-9850. Running time: one hour.

ELECTION: A CALL TO GET OUT THE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For every registered Republican, election day (Tuesday) is a must date for 
voting. For years, our (36th) Congressional District had been represented by a 
Republican, and it should be. But in 1992, circumstances prevailed to elect 
Jane Harman, a formidable but liberal Democrat opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 All who believe in limited and smaller government, less regulation of 
commerce, lower taxes, punishment of criminals rather than blaming society for 
their conduct, i.e., Republican principles, must vote on (Tuesday), and vote 
for the person who can best defeat Harman in November. We need a Republican for 
the district, and we need one more Republican voice in the national 
congressional body to offset the presently controlling party, which, like 
Harman, feels government is the answer to all our problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Vote for the candidate you feel can win back this seat. I have decided to 
support Ron Florance for the following reasons: Ron is a lifelong resident of 
California, not a newcomer. He has always been a Republican, not a very recent 
convert. He has a long record of public service, including eight years as mayor 
of Palos Verdes Estates, not just a short stop on the way to higher office. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance has had a very successful private-sector career. And he has proved he 
is the candidate that has the financial resources and support to match the vast 
wealth of the incumbent.

 Ron Florance, one of the contenders for the GOP congressional nomination in 
the June 7 primary, is a pleasant fellow. For one simple reason, however, he 
would not make a strong candidate come November. 
</P>
<P>
 As reported in area newspapers, Florance and his real estate business have 
become tangled in a web of pending lawsuits alleging fraud and other wrongs. 
Incumbent Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) would smash Ron Florance at the 
polls, fairly or not, by broadcasting his troubled business background. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, Republicans who want to beat Jane Harman this November on the 
issues that really matter -- jobs, taxes, spending, crime -- should look beyond 
Ron Florance on June 7.

 Christmas is coming very early to the California taxpayers this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch for it, in Santa's sleigh disguised as Proposition 180. You will find it 
written in its entirety in the California ballot pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Just wait until you see all the goodies; this "wish list" is detailed on 10 
pages of very small print, double columns. 
</P>
<P>
 This proposition will make us, the taxpaying residents of California, indebted 
with almost $2 billion in bonds, which will be paid for by us, and our 
children, and our children's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Any site or resource that could be thought to be preserved, enhanced, 
acquired, expanded, restored or developed is included in this huge taxpayer 
giveaway. There are 400, more or less, of these grants. 
</P>
<P>
 One acquisition is especially heartwarming, since it affects us directly here 
in the South Bay. I quote from page 31: "$232,000 for the acquisition of lands 
for public access to the Colorado River in the vicinity of the City of Palos 
Verdes Estates." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that nice. I always read about how the big earthquake will give Lake 
Havasu an ocean view. I didn't know it had happened already. 
</P>
<P>
 How many more of these wonderful wishes are so well-written? After all, it's 
only taxpayer money, only $2 billion. Environmentalists love their preservation 
projects as long as someone else pays. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is another grant, although it is a little vague, and rather expensive 
(page 31): 
</P>
<P>
 "$10 million for historic preservation projects." (For elderly politicians?) 
</P>
<P>
 Here is another grant (page 38): 
</P>
<P>
 "$1 million to the City of Los Angeles for restoration of the El Segundo 
Dunes." 
</P>
<P>
 Why does it cost $1 million to repair the sandy dunes when, on page 36, for 
the same amount of money, we can acquire, restore and enhance existing and 
historic bay lands, including associated habitats in eastern Marin County. Now, 
that must be a bargain! 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to Christmas giving, just ask and we taxpayers will oblige. By 
the way, has anyone else read the entire Proposition 180, and not just the 
emotional excerpts to make us feel that we must give and give until it hurts?

REGIONAL REPORT; LADERA HEIGHTS; RESIDENTS HAPPY WITH BAN ON JOB-SEEKING DAY 
LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ronnie Cooper could barely contain her jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
 "By God, (county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke) did it!" exclaimed 
Cooper, president of the Ladera Civic Assn. and one of the primary supporters 
of a law adopted Tuesday by the county that bans laborers from curbside 
solicitation of jobs in unincorporated areas of the county. "She's taken a lot 
of stuff. . . . People can say whatever they want, but politicians are supposed 
to represent the community. And she represented us." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper and many other Ladera Heights homeowners reveled in their victory last 
week after the county Board of Supervisors voted to enact a law that residents 
had sought for months. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was essentially the same measure proposed last month by Burke at 
the prompting of Ladera Heights homeowners, who had complained for years about 
traffic and other problems they said the laborers caused. But that measure was 
temporarily scaled down after the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant 
rights groups loudly protested that the law violated the laborers' 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption of the new ordinance followed a state appellate court ruling two 
weeks ago upholding a similar law restricting day laborers in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Hellwig, a 24-year Ladera Heights resident, said laborers crossed a line 
when they began urinating and defecating on private property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not against anybody seeking work, but there has been a bit of a problem," 
he said. "People felt uneasy about passing by them." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance takes effect in July and makes curbside job-seeking a 
misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's shocking that it passed," said ACLU Director Ramona Ripston. "It's 
another one of those attempts by government to pander to the public to make 
people think they're really doing something about a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, whose district includes Ladera Heights, said that the strong opinions 
voiced for several years by her constituents left her no choice but to vote for 
the measure. She added that her office worked hard to find a hiring work site 
for laborers as part of a compromise on the issue, but none could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply could not find" a site, she said. "We'd still like to find one. But 
the bottom line is the community doesn't want the day laborers negatively 
impacting the area. They and their kids want to be able to come and go 
peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvaro Maldonado, director of the Pro-Immigrant Mobilization Coalition, said 
that the ordinance capitalizes on anti-immigrant sentiment and unfairly targets 
poor Latinos who simply need jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very, very devastating," said Maldonado, whose group picketed against 
Burke's original ordinance last month in front of her field office. "It's 
criminalizing people who need work." 
</P>
<P>
 Some area residents sided with Maldonado or expressed sympathy for the plight 
of the day laborers.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about human beings here," said Faz Elahi, president of South 
Ladera Neighbors. "There's nowhere for them to go, nothing for them to do. A 
law is fine, but this law is not consistent with reality. It's not really going 
to change anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said she is confident that most residents will help enforce the new law 
by promptly calling sheriff's deputies.

 "All we want to do is preserve and maintain our community and not have a bunch 
of outsiders who don't pay taxes come in and take advantage," she said. "We 
just wanted them to not be there."

REGIONAL REPORT; CULVER CITY / MONTEREY PARK; INPUT SOUGHT ON BAY CLEANUP PLAN

 The public may comment at two public hearings today on a five-year plan to 
clean up Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project, which is administered by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, affects an area from the Ventura County line 
to Point Fermin. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan, released in April, identifies 73 priority actions that will 
cost an estimated $67 million. A foundation has been set up to secure funding 
from government and private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Many organizations, including Heal the Bay, the American Oceans Campaign, 
Chevron Corp., Southern California Edison, Heal the Bay and the Sierra Club, 
support the plan, EPA spokeswoman Karen Caesar said. 
</P>
<P>
 A final draft will be submitted to Gov. Pete Wilson in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that people realize the plan affects not just the bay but also 
the watershed -- the whole area that drains into the bay. That's 414 square 
miles," Caesar said. "A big part of our work is pollution protection."  
</P>
<P>
 The first hearing will be at 10 a.m. at the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality 
Control Board, 101 Center Plaza Drive, Monterey Park. Those who cannot attend 
may send written comments to Caesar at that address. The comments must be 
received by June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 A second meeting will be at 6 p.m. in the IRI Room of the Veterans Memorial 
Building, 4117 Overland Ave., Culver City. SUSAN WOODWARD

TELEVISION: PROVIDING PUBLIC ACCESS ON CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reference to the April 21 article by Scott Collins regarding public-access 
TV ("Commercial Appeal"), the specific purpose of the Gardena Community Access 
Corp. is to provide assistance to the general public, such as coordinating the 
usage and programming of two community access cable television channels within 
the city of Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 While one can argue that public access has not become "the electronic soapbox" 
that would put mass media in the hands of the masses and invigorate democracy, 
public access does give every citizen an opportunity to express ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Gardena Community Access Corp., in conjunction with the 
municipal election, produced four commercial inserts to be aired on networks to 
promote participation in the municipal election. The corporation also provided 
live cablecasting of the candidates forum and subsequently replayed the tape on 
a community access cable television channel to provide information to the 
community. On the night of the election, the corporation provided live coverage 
of election returns, thereby giving community members an opportunity to see 
democracy in action. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gardena, with the wealth of community cultural events and youth sports 
programming, public access is serving a worthwhile purpose.

RELIGION: CLARIFYING POINTS OF ORTHODOX CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While informative, your May 5 article, "Small But Growing Orthodox Church 
Needs Larger Home," requires clarification. As an Orthodox Catholic of Greek 
heritage, it was difficult muddling through distorted Roman church history to 
discover and appreciate my own faith. Contrary to the Western world's belief, 
all roads do not lead to Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted that the three great faiths of the world -- Islam, Judaism 
and Christianity -- all originated in the east. In the early years of the Holy 
Catholic and Apostolic Church, the church was administered by the five historic 
patriarchal centers: Jerusalem (where it all began), Antioch (where St. Peter 
established the first Holy See and where people were first called Christians), 
Alexandria, Constantinople (known today as Istanbul) and Rome. Each patriarch 
handled the administrative matters in his own province, while theology and 
dogma were decided by the ecumenical (universal) council of bishops, convoked 
by the Byzantine emperors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the west, the Pope (Patriarch of the West and Bishop of Rome) was the 
unchallenged spiritual and administrative head of the church. Meanwhile in the 
east, the other patriarchates remained intact and in full communion with one 
another. The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is regarded first among 
equals, the spiritual head of the some 350 million Eastern (Greek) Orthodox in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of theological and political disputes, the two churches split 
in 1054 AD. The Western Church became known as the Roman Catholic Church and 
the Eastern Church became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church. And while the 
Roman Church added many innovations foreign to early Christianity, the Eastern 
Church remained firm to the original teachings of the seven ecumenical councils 
of the first eight centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Orthodox Catholics take great pride that not a change has been made 
since the last Ecumenical Council held in 787 AD. 
</P>
<P>
 It is essential that Orthodox Catholics continually educate, inform and 
enlighten people about our faith. As fellow Americans, we appeal for respect, 
representation and recognition as we battle to get and keep the facts straight 
on the true history of Greek Orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
 I thank the Los Angeles Times for recognizing our church by including the 
article, and look forward to reading more informative and well-researched 
articles on the Eastern Orthodox Church and her faithful.

PEOPLE: FOR 2 GRADUATES, AGE IS A MATTER OF DEGREE

 The Heiner family has always known the importance of a college degree. Doug 
Heiner is a professor of medicine, and nearly all of his nine children have 
earned at least one college diploma. So it was no surprise that his grandson, 
24-year-old Douglas Fuller, graduated from Cal State Dominguez Hills last 
weekend with a bachelor's degree in accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another relative who might have caused a stir. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Heiner, 67, Doug Heiner's wife and Fuller's grandmother, also graduated 
with a bachelor's degree from the university on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony marked a milestone for Joy Heiner, who left the University of 
Utah 50 years ago to marry her high school sweetheart and raise the couple's 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never regretted leaving, but I knew I would have been a better person if I 
had graduated," said Joy Heiner, who graduated magna cum laude with a degree in 
English.  
</P>
<P>
 Heiner's studies renewed her interest in reading and writing. She delighted in 
reading John Milton's "Paradise Lost," and she published a couple of articles 
in the university's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiner said her toughest challenge after enrolling at the university five 
years ago was completing the math requirement. She frequently studied late into 
the night to pass three preparatory courses before struggling through a class 
in finite math. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house didn't stay as clean," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But her math skills multiplied.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was crafty and tenacious," recalls William Armacost, the professor she 
credits with helping her through the course. He said she frequently solved 
challenging word problems with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Heiner said she sometimes cornered opponents after the couple's tennis 
games to ask for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I finally learned I had passed, I just cried," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Heiner studied alongside her husband, who often reads medical reports in 
the evenings. His companionship helped her persist through tough times, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she graduated with Fuller, the two never studied together or took the 
same class. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they did grow closer at the university. Fuller said he often visited 
with Heiner as the two passed on their way to classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time it was a little unusual to see her there," he said. But soon 
the novelty wore off. As for Heiner, she never considered her age while 
studying on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really thought about it," she said. "It's a really diverse campus." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so happy for her," Fuller said. "She's always put the family first, so 
this is just great."

EDUCATION: HOW TO TAKE AN INTELLIGENT APPROACH TO FINAL EXAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, Mary Laine Yarber teaches English at Santa Monica High 
School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Area students don't have much longer to wait before reaching the beloved prize 
for completing yet another year of school: summer vacation.  
</P>
<P>
 But before you start shopping for an ice chest or tanning oil, you've got to 
complete a last round of exams or projects. Most area junior high and high 
school students will battle these in the next two to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Start preparing for them now. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some teachers are trading the usual two-hour final exam for an 
evaluation based on a project or exhibition, most still use the traditional 
exam format or give some kind of shorter test. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in preparing for any final exam is to find out when the teacher 
will hold a review session. These are the closest you can come to seeing the 
actual test because teachers tell you which concepts, chapters, people or other 
information to focus on.  
</P>
<P>
 If your teacher has not mentioned a review session, ask for one. Enough 
requests might prompt him or her to think twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure you take careful notes at the review session, and bring a list of 
questions you've jotted down. Studying concepts you just don't understand gets 
you nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, start skimming through your entire semester (or specified term) of 
notes, assignments and tests, highlighting with a colored pen any details you 
feel you need to study further. 
</P>
<P>
 Do about an hour's worth of this every school day. You may have heard stories 
of students who don't touch their books or notes until the night before the 
exam, then study up for hours and perform brilliantly the next day. That may 
work -- but for very few people. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that you're much more likely to understand and remember 
information that you tackle piece by piece over time rather than in a frantic 
all-nighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides studying the material covered in class, try to use at least one 
supplemental source. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, ask your teacher if there are videotapes, magazines, PBS 
documentaries or local museum displays that relate to subjects covered in your 
upcoming exam. 
</P>
<P>
 An exam answer that includes references to outside study is particularly 
impressive. It shows that you have some initiative and went beyond the 
assignments.  
</P>
<P>
 One of my most successful techniques in high school and college was "playing 
teacher" by devising exam questions of my own. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing your own exam provides an invaluable overview of the course. It also 
helps you to recognize which concepts are most important and what types of 
questions are likely to be asked about them (true/false, multiple choice, short 
answer, essay, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 Write test questions and answers for the entire range of knowledge that your 
teacher's exam will cover.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if your teacher's exam contains questions very similar to 
the version that you create beforehand.  
</P>
<P>
 Studying with a friend is a great idea, particularly for quizzing each other 
with questions you've composed based on the exams, as long as you choose a 
partner whose performance in the class is at least equal to yours. Otherwise 
you may spend the time improving your partner's test score rather than your 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's best to have a study partner who knows the subject better than 
you do, so you can ask questions of him or her. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much time you spend studying in the coming weeks, knock off 
early on the night before the big exam. Again, bear in mind that last-minute 
cramming does little good anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, start the mind-and-body phase of preparing for the test. 
</P>
<P>
 First, assemble all the materials you'll need for the next day, such as pens, 
pencils, paper, dictionary and calculator. That way you won't surprise yourself 
unpleasantly as you start your test the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Set your clothes and other belongings out too. Choosing your wardrobe ahead of 
time can mean the difference between being on time or being late for your exam. 
Being late can mean missing important instructions, advice or even extra-credit 
opportunities related to the exam. Some teachers won't repeat the information 
for latecomers. 
</P>
<P>
 A special word about the clothes you select for exam day: I have no scientific 
research to offer, but I have heard repeatedly from my students that wearing 
their favorite outfits helps boost their confidence and concentration for 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've organized the morning routine, get to bed early. Eight hours of 
sleep is a good goal before big exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast is always crucial, but especially on exam day. Skip the doughnuts 
and soft drinks that seem to be customary for a lot of students. The sugar may 
provide an energy burst, but then it "drops" you quickly and dramatically. 
Stick with carbohydrates (bread, bagels, low-sugar muffins) and some fruit for 
a more steady and effective source of energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Find your desk early, sit down and set up your materials. That way there will 
be time to ask your teacher last-minute questions or hit the restroom before 
the test starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't study at the last minute -- it might just confuse you. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, spend the last pre-exam minutes relaxing your mind and body so that 
the information can flow smoothly when it's finally needed.  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing beats taking a few long, deep breaths, then holding each a few seconds 
before letting them out slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 With each breath, picture yourself doing well on the exam. Smile (at least to 
yourself, if you're afraid of looking silly to others) and silently say, "I'm 
ready to do well" or some similarly encouraging phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even the most careful study may not produce a perfect exam 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how you try to anticipate the scope and format of the test, you may 
still encounter some questions that will prompt the age-old question on exam 
day: 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did that one come from?"

OUT AND ABOUT / THE FOREMEN: FOLKIES WITH A SATIRICAL TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 What do Bill Clinton, Oliver North and Jesse Helms have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 The satirical folk quartet The Foremen answers this question and many more in 
its theatrical production, "The Foremen -- Folk Heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is a throwback of sorts, bringing together folk and theater music 
with a twist of satirical humor. The four-member group performs original 
material that is reminiscent of bands such as the Kingston Trio, the 
Limelighters and the Nutty Wanderers, who made their way on to the musical 
scene three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But they go beyond the folkies of yesteryear, combining harmony and lyrics 
based on contemporary material from newspapers to take satirical jabs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to political targets, topics include the battle of the sexes, 
homelessness, struggles of the working class and international events, with 
titles such as "Saddam Shame." 
</P>
<P>
 "People appreciate the opportunity to listen with both ears," said troupe 
leader Roy Zimmerman, a resident of Pacific Palisades. "Once they have heard a 
little of what we do, the response is immediate and very rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman, who earned a degree in musical composition from San Jose State 
University, came up with the idea of performing satire several years ago when 
he found a disc called "Come Along With the Wayfarers" while rummaging through 
a 99-cent record bin.  
</P>
<P>
 "It struck me so funny that four fraternity brothers were singing about life," 
Zimmerman said. "I thought this would be a great vehicle for me to write 
satirical material." 
</P>
<P>
 It gave him the idea to form his own group, which includes tenor Kenny Rhodes, 
bassist Andy Corwin and guitarist Doug Whitney. During the last two years, the 
quartet has performed at galleries, coffeehouses and other intimate venues 
across the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's popularity has spread to the airwaves. Some of their songs have 
been featured on radio programs such as the nationally syndicated "Dr. Demento" 
and the "Jim Hightower Show" on KMPC. 
</P>
<P>
 But to really understand the group's humor, it's best to attend a live 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the only ones doing (this type of) satire," said Chuck Harter, who 
recently attended a performance. "Their songs are right on the money and the 
singing is great." 
</P>
<P>
 The Foremen presents "Folk Heroes" at Cafe Luna, 665 N. Robertson Blvd., West 
Hollywood, through June 30. Performances are at 7:30 p.m. Thursdays, 8 p.m. 
Fridays and 5 p.m. Sundays (no Saturday show). Tickets are $15 or $12 for a 
group of six or more. Credit card reservations can be made by calling (310) 
652-0611. For all other reservations, call (310) 471-3979. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

ONCE MORE ONTO THE BEACH; JOY AND PAIN MINGLE IN SANTA MONICA RE-ENACTMENT OF 
NORMANDY INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 This time around, there was a single landing craft instead of thousands, and 
it landed near sunset instead of at dawn's light. The weather was balmy, not 
clammy, and some of the soldiers who waded ashore wore dress shoes and business 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
 It took some imagination, but Wednesday's re-enactment at Santa Monica Beach 
of the D-day landing at Normandy 50 years ago was close enough to the original 
to stir memories of that deadly day when the Allies began liberating France. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's faux landing before about 1,000 onlookers was part of a thank-you 
celebration sponsored by the French Consulate in Los Angeles. It was supported 
by a few ships, including a restored World War II Liberty Ship, and seven 
vintage Hellcat fighter aircraft that flew over in formation. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty veterans of the real thing, some of whom stumbled and needed a helping 
hand from active-duty soldiers as they waded ashore, were greeted by dozens of 
French children wearing "Merci L'Amerique" T-shirts and carrying white 
carnations. 
</P>
<P>
 First off the landing craft was 73-year-old Stanley Kaufman of Long Beach, who 
sprinted through the surf with his knees churning high, as if the passage of 
five decades had not slowed him a bit and he was dodging enemy gunfire. Fifty 
years ago, he was among the advance force of paratroopers who dropped into the 
French town of Ste.-Mer-Eglise behind the beach, with the job of opening up 
routes for the Allies to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he was in Santa Monica, redubbed San Monique for the day, Kaufman 
said only, "Well, it was D-day, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as unforeseen obstacles, bad weather and enemy fire disrupted well-laid 
plans at Normandy, there were some glitches Wednesday. The veterans had been 
promised, for example, that they would be able to walk onto the sand just north 
of the Santa Monica pier. Instead, they waded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a wet butt," complained retired chief warrant officer Bob Dorsk of 
North Hollywood. Dorsk missed D-day but landed later on France's south coast as 
part of a force that would push north toward Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of 15 World War II veterans who received medals from the 
governments of France and Normandy during a ceremony after the landing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the real D-day invasion, about 160,000 Allied soldiers landed along a 
50-mile stretch of rugged Normandy coastline at dawn on June 6, 1944. American 
forces were concentrated at Utah Beach, where some of the heaviest fighting and 
casualties occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying the American flag for Wednesday's ceremony was Bill Slaughter of 
Santa Maria, who described the D-day landing as "hell on earth." He was one of 
only six members of his company of 250 who survived that furious battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Frackman of Laguna Hills was among the second wave of soldiers to hit Utah 
Beach. "I've already seen this, I saw the original," he said of the 
re-enactment. "It's more of a memorial than a celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Martin of Bakersfield was there with his father, a former Navy petty 
officer who had the grisly job in the war of collecting the bodies of the dead 
and shipping them, stacked three high on ship bunks, back to England. Martin 
said his father is fond of recalling his duty days and telling his war stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only significant part he played in the world," Martin said of his 
father. "It was (his) glory days." 
</P>
<P>
 Good feelings between the French and the Americans were mutual and flowed as 
freely Wednesday as the wine had as each town was liberated. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Goode of Los Angeles remembers wondering before D-day what he was doing 
in that part of the world, about to invade a country he had never seen on 
behalf of people he did not know. "I discovered the answer when I met the 
French," he said. "A country is its people and the people of France are why we 
fought. They were our kind of people." 
</P>
<P>
 As they will next week in France for the actual anniversary, French and 
American dignitaries marked the day with speeches. French Consul General 
Jean-Maurice Ripert, who came up with the idea for the ceremony of gratitude, 
said it was important to remember the exploits of the brave. "Our children must 
know and never forget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillipe de Bourgoing, mayor of the Normandy town of Tracy-sur-Mer, said he 
will never forget the sight that he saw the morning that the Americans and the 
Allies finally set foot on French soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the souvenir of my life," he said of the scene in Normandy that seared 
its way into his memory. "About 7 in the morning after a hard night of bombing 
. . . I was able to reach the cliff and have a view of the sea. It was an 
amazing sight. Ships of all kinds. . . . I remember the thought: 'They have 
brought everything they have.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After the speeches and the ceremonies, the sound of a solitary trumpeter 
playing "Sonnerie aux Morts," the French equivalent of taps, brought the event 
to a solemn close. 
</P>

TUNNELING TO THE PAST; RED LINE WORKER UNEARTHS FOSSILS OF ANIMALS THAT ROAMED 
HOLLYWOOD AREA MORE THAN 10,000 YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Michael Guinther's scientific instincts run deep. About 60 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinther, a worker on the Metro Red Line subway, has found four prehistoric 
fossils within a two-month period while boring tunnels beneath Hollywood 
Boulevard. His discoveries -- teeth of a mastodon and a camel, leg and toe 
bones of a horse and the foot of an ancient bison -- all are at least 10,000 
years old, and possibly up to 200,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said Wednesday that the finds could well be the first of their kind in 
the Hollywood area, a few miles northeast of the La Brea Tar Pits, where 
similar remains have been unearthed for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fills in the record . . . of where these animals were living and dying and 
being deposited," said Christopher Shaw, collection manager at the George C. 
Page Museum at the tar pits. "It gives us more of the L.A. Basin to be able to 
interpret." 
</P>
<P>
 Guinther -- who, fittingly, works the graveyard shift in the tunnels anywhere 
from 40 to 80 feet below the Earth's surface -- could not be reached for 
comment Wednesday. But the way his bosses at the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority tell it, he stumbled upon the leg and toe bones of a prehistoric 
horse March 8, nearly 50 feet below the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and 
Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as the tunnels proceeded westward beneath Hollywood Boulevard, Guinther 
found a second fossil -- part of a mastodon molar -- on March 31, followed just 
a few days later by the discovery of the bison forefoot beneath Gramercy 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on April 20, about 76 feet below the Hollywood Freeway, he came 
across molars from an ancient species of camel that was once common in North 
America but is now extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a good eye," Jim Sowell, manager of environmental compliance for the 
project, said of Guinther. "He sees something gleam, hops down, picks it up, 
puts it in his lunch box and gives it to the paleontological monitor the next 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 For his acute powers of observation, Guinther has been honored with a 
certificate of appreciation by the MTA, which encourages workers to spot and 
turn in fossils or artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to impress upon the workers that the fossils are scientifically 
important," said Bruce Lander, the consultant on the project whose company 
catalogues the finds. Eventually, the fossils will probably be donated to the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of fossils have been uncovered since construction of the Red Line 
began several years ago, most of them of marine invertebrates, Lander said. 
Excavation has also turned up a cache of culturally significant artifacts, such 
as cooking utensils and porcelain from Old Chinatown that was razed half a 
century ago to make room for Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The fossils found by Guinther closely resemble the remains of animals yielded 
by the tar pits. The Pleistocene-era creatures roamed the area for thousands of 
years until the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said fossils of mastodons and camels are relatively rare in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The horse and bison, thought by some to be direct ancestors of modern buffalo, 
are more common, Shaw said.

SHOOTINGS OF 2 SPARK OUTRAGE; VIOLENCE: NEIGHBORS WONDER WHY THE YOUTHS, WHO 
WERE NOT IN A GANG, WERE TARGETED. 
</P>

 The two teen-agers were on their way back from a corner hamburger stand in 
East Los Angeles on a warm spring evening, one on foot and the other riding a 
bicycle behind him. Four gang members in a red Toyota pulled up beside them and 
opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy on foot, Felipe Gomez, 14, ran for cover and hid behind a parked car. 
One of the gang members jumped out of the car, chased him and shot him in the 
head at point-blank range, execution style, according to a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman. A few hours later, on Tuesday night, Felipe was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend, Jimmy Cericeroz, 19, was shot in the back and fell in the street. 
The gang members wheeled their car around and ran over Cericeroz. They then put 
the car in reverse and were about to run him over again, witnesses said, but a 
screaming neighbor scared them off. Cericeroz was taken to Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center where he was in serious condition and could be 
paralyzed, the sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drive-by killings have become so common in Southern California -- there were 
720 gang-related killings in the county last year -- that many residents have 
become inured to the carnage. But on Wednesday, those in Felipe Gomez's 
neighborhood were still stunned by his death and trying to understand the 
brutality of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents of the neighborhood recall the days when violence did not 
dictate how they lived, when parents did not have to keep their children inside 
on warm afternoons, when they did not have to hide under their sofas every time 
they heard a car backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "This killing was so coldblooded, I couldn't believe it," said a witness who 
requested anonymity. "I didn't think it could get any worse on the streets . . 
. but it has." 
</P>
<P>
 While some crime statistics have dipped in Los Angeles County during the past 
year, gang shootings in East Los Angeles keep rising, said Al Garcia, a 
sheriff's deputy who works with the department's gang investigation unit. Last 
year at this time, sheriff's detectives had investigated six gang-related 
homicides in East Los Angeles, and there were 15 for the year, he said. This 
year there have been 18 already. 
</P>
<P>
 An edict late last year by the Mexican Mafia threatening to kill gang members 
who commit drive-by shootings has done little good, Garcia said. The only 
impact, he said, is that there now are more "walk-up" shootings on the streets 
of East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's shooting might have been in retaliation for a shooting the 
previous week only a few blocks away, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither of the youths shot Tuesday were gang members, neighbors said. 
Cericeroz did not even live in the neighborhood. His family lived in Montebello 
and he occasionally stopped by to visit his grandmother and a few friends. 
Although Felipe was not in a gang, residents said, he had been in trouble with 
juvenile authorities and was attending a high school for youths on probation. 
Felipe had several friends and relatives who were members of Ford Maravilla, 
the neighborhood gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys doing the shooting wanted to kill gang members," George (Mugsy) 
Hernandez said. Instead, neighbors said, they settled for killing someone who 
simply lived in the gang's neighborhood. "Felipe was just a little kid," 
Hernandez said. "He wasn't involved in the gang thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe and Cericeroz were good friends, said Omar Gomez, the slain youth's 
brother. They worked together on Sundays at an East Los Angeles swap meet and 
often played soccer in the street where they were shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now on the sidewalk, in front of the weathered stucco houses, there is a small 
shrine for Felipe, filled with votive candles and freshly cut roses and 
gladioluses. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends plan to hold a carwash Saturday at Olympic Boulevard and Ferris 
Avenue to raise money to help the family pay funeral expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I grew up here, if we had a beef with someone from another neighborhood, 
we'd fight," said Adrian Hernandez, 29, a cousin of the slain youth. "Arguments 
could end up in blows, but that's it. Now it's a different world. All over the 
neighborhood I see little kids shooting little kids."

MAN GETS 3 LIFE TERMS IN HOSPITAL RAMPAGE; COURTS: COUNTY-USC BEEFED UP 
SECURITY AFTER THE 1993 SHOOTING SPREE THAT LEFT THREE DOCTORS WOUNDED. THE 
GUNMAN REFUSED TO ENTER AN INSANITY PLEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who went on a shooting rampage in a crowded County-USC Medical Center 
emergency waiting room last year, wounding three doctors, was sentenced 
Wednesday to three life sentences plus 12 years in an incident that prompted 
the hospital to institute strict security measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge John H. Reid ordered Damascio Ybarra Torres, 41, a Skid 
Row loner at the time of his arrest, to serve two of the life sentences back to 
back. That makes it likely that Torres will die in prison, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid noted that Torres, in plotting the rampage and holding two hospital 
workers hostage in a five-hour standoff with police, was "driven by the 
compulsion or belief" that County-USC personnel had used him as a guinea pig in 
AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the judge told Torres, there was no evidence to justify the belief. 
"Assuming your claim is correct," Reid said, "that doesn't give you the right 
to try to kill someone." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, County-USC employees said they had feared that violence 
would erupt in the often understaffed emergency waiting room -- one of the 
busiest in the country -- where frustrations and tempers often flared. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of Torres' sentence drew mixed comments from hospital workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres "got what he deserved," said Dr. James Lee, a County-USC resident who 
has worked in the hospital's emergency room. "It sends a message to others that 
this sort of thing will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the wounded physicians, Dr. Glen Rogers, was surprised at the harshness 
of the sentence. "Wow. I guess it sounds a little bit rough to me," he said. 
"Anyone who spent any amount of time around Torres realizes that he's not in 
control of his actions in the same way that you and I are in control of our 
actions. . . . I frankly don't have any ill will towards Torres. He's clearly 
got psychiatric problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The two other men who were wounded, Dr. Richard May and Dr. Paul Kaszubowski, 
could not be reached for comment. Both testified during Torres' trial that they 
are no longer able to practice medicine as a result of their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 County-USC personnel interviewed Wednesday said the increased security at the 
facility since the shooting made them feel safer. "You can see the difference," 
Lee said. "Even the hallways are more orderly." 
</P>
<P>
 Another physician who did not want to be quoted by name agreed, but added that 
little could be done to stop someone who was determined to wreak havoc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel more secure now," he said, "but I don't know if we'll ever be 
completely safe from some deranged person." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital spokeswoman Adalaida De La Cerda said she often hears positive 
comments from employees about the increased security. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking through the corridors near the emergency room, she pointed out 
uniformed, county-employed safety police posted every few yards, including one 
stationed inside the waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
 Also stationed there, De La Cerda said, is a hospital ombudsman whose job it 
is to calm agitated patients and to spot trouble brewing. Hospital workers and 
waiting patients are now separated by a wall with bulletproof windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Private guards wearing blazers and slacks and carrying hand-held metal 
detectors are now stationed at every door with instructions not to let anyone 
in who does not have legitimate business at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-seven county safety police officers were assigned to the hospital 
before the shooting; now there are 129, De La Cerda said. No private security 
force existed before the attack, but now there are 109 guards, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, De La Cerda said, all personnel have been trained to spot people 
who might cause trouble, and visiting hours, which were almost unlimited, have 
been restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of security cameras also has been increased significantly and only 
two doors are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Such measures have been effective, De La Cerda said. "We haven't had an 
incident since the shooting. And God willing, we won't ever again." 
</P>
<P>
 She would not speculate on whether the measures would have stopped Torres, who 
entered the hospital Feb. 8, 1993, carrying a hunting knife and three concealed 
guns -- a sawed-off rifle, .380-caliber automatic handgun and .44 magnum 
revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 At his trial, witnesses testified that Torres shouted: "I don't want nurses! I 
want doctors! I want white coats!" as he opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the advice of his lawyer, Torres took the witness stand and admitted 
to meticulously planning the shooting, then arming himself with the three guns 
and a hunting knife and carrying it out. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he acted in self-defense after doctors at the hospital injected him 
with a yellow substance that he said causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 When he went to the hospital on several occasions to be treated for resulting 
illnesses, he said, emergency room doctors dismissively referred him to the 
mental ward. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated five hours before finding Torres guilty on all counts of 
attempted murder and false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 As he had throughout his trial, Torres on Wednesday repeatedly asked Reid to 
dismiss his lawyer, saying she had failed to call as witnesses, as he 
instructed her, three County-USC researchers Torres believes were conducting 
the AIDS research. 
</P>
<P>
 He also criticized the lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Joan Croker, for not 
backing his claim of self-defense, based on his contention that he was 
protecting himself from experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Croker had attempted to enter an insanity plea for Torres before the trial, 
but he would not allow it. She told reporters after the sentencing that she 
tried to find the researchers, but now does not believe that they exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge denied Torres' request for Croker's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Ingalls, said there is no 
evidence that Torres has AIDS.

POLICE REPORT BLAMES BEAR'S DEATH ON STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA O'NEILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State wildlife officials could not immediately be located, they lacked the 
right equipment and they did not properly tranquilize a 356-pound bear that 
wandered into Azusa on May 20 and was eventually killed, according to a report 
from the Azusa Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The bear, one of an estimated 60 California black bears inhabiting the nearby 
Angeles National Forest, came onto city streets at 4 a.m. and was killed 3 1/2 
hours later by 14 shots fired by four police officers. The death sparked an 
outcry from animal rights activists and area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa police issued a seven-page report Tuesday that placed most of the blame 
on the state Department of Fish and Game. In addition to using an insufficient 
tranquilizer dosage, Fish and Game officials were slow to respond in many ways, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Moore, a department spokesman, said state officials were still 
reviewing the report. He acknowledged that a better system of contacting 
officials during off hours is needed, but said that the dosage used to bring 
down the bear exceeded the amount recommended for an animal of its size.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fish and Game Department is giving the home phone numbers of its wardens 
to local police departments to enable faster communication when wild animals 
wander into residential areas, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police dispatcher who took the initial call about the bear contacted the 
San Gabriel Valley Humane Society, the report said. The officer there told her 
he was not equipped to deal with a bear. He advised her to contact Fish and 
Game officials, but the dispatcher could not find an after-hours number. 
</P>
<P>
 A Glendora police officer monitoring the incident on his police radio told the 
dispatcher he knew where a Fish and Game employee lived and the employee was 
escorted to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The police report concluded that Fish and Game officials erred when they fired 
two separate tranquilizer darts, one containing two cubic centimeters of 
Telazol and a second, 27 minutes later, containing three cubic centimeters. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent expert consulted by police said the first dart should have 
contained five cubic centimeters of tranquilizer to bring down a 350-pound 
bear. The report also states that the Fish and Game biologist did not have a 
needle long enough to transfer the Telazol from a vial to the dart syringe. A 
Glendora police officer was sent to Foothill Presbyterian Hospital to pick up a 
needle. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the report said that a Fish and Game official engaged in a heated 
discussion with a police sergeant over whether to kill the bear and screamed, 
"Shoot it, shoot it!" when the bear approached him. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said police decided to shoot the bear once it left a perimeter 
established by officers to keep the animal away from spectators and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In rebutting the report, Fish and Game spokesman Moore said that tranquilizers 
can be mixed in various potencies and that the first dart contained a higher 
dosage than recommended for a bear of that size. Most animals will become 
immobilized in 15 minutes but some can take up to an hour, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said he did not know why neither of the drug injection kits the 
biologist had on the scene contained a longer needle. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said that he had not talked to the official who allegedly told police to 
shoot the animal, but that the biologist and another warden on the scene said 
they did not remember such a demand being made. Moore said the official in 
question had actually stepped between a police officer and the bear in order to 
stop the officer from killing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said many biologists and wardens work out of their homes with phones 
directly linked to their department phones. "It's rare in our line of business 
that someone has to get a hold of us right away," he said. "We need to set up 
some communications systems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Dyer, a spokesman for an animal rights coalition that called for further 
investigation of the shooting, said that the Department of Fish and Game did 
not act responsibly in tranquilizing the bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no one on the scene who knew what they were doing," Dyer said. "The 
facts speak for themselves."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 9 CITY 
LIBRARIES DAMAGED IN EARTHQUAKE TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine city library branches damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake will reopen this 
summer -- in better shape than they were before the quake, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because these libraries are closed and some have not had refurbishing for a 
long time, we're trying to do some work, like new carpeting," said department 
spokesman Bob Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 The branches sustained $1.2 million in damage. Hit the hardest was the Granada 
Hills branch, which required a new ceiling and roof. Water damage destroyed 
25,000 children's books, said Kris Morita, assistant business manager for the 
Los Angeles Library Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The other branches to reopen are in Chatsworth, Northridge, Reseda, Woodland 
Hills, Van Nuys and Pacoima and two branches in North Hollywood. The Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the state will fund about 90% of the repairs 
and the city will pay the balance, Morita said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Library Foundation of Los Angeles also is attempting to raise $500,000 for 
repairs, said director Evelyn Hoffman. Individuals and corporations have 
contributed $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys branch, in a civic complex next to Superior Court and a police 
station, was a popular lunchtime destination for workers, police officers and 
jurors, said manager Gene Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day we are working, folks come up and peer in the windows and rattle on 
the door," he said. "Every time we step out, people ask us about the 
reopening."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EX-CONVICT 
PLEADS GUILTY IN REAL ESTATE BROKER'S KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-convict and former gang member pleaded guilty to first-degree murder 
Wednesday in the killing of a real estate broker in July, 1992, at a home in 
Coldwater Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of a plea agreement, Anthony Rodriguez Pacheco, 39, will be 
sentenced on Aug. 3 to 36 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Elaine Siegel was found in a bathroom of the Hollywood Hills home 
where she had been conducting an open house for other brokers. She had been 
stabbed 13 times and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco, who was working at the time as a sandwich delivery man, "may have 
gone to the house just to look around and something happened that might have 
caused him to react in a violent manner," Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Montagna 
Montagna said Wednesday. "We just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco, who had served a four-year prison term for a gang-related shooting in 
Ventura County, was arrested after one of his sisters told police that he might 
have killed Siegel.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; GANG MEMBER 
CONVICTED IN SLAYING OF GIRL AT DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Inglewood gang member was convicted of second-degree murder Thursday in the 
shooting death last year of a 12-year-old girl at a dance at the Boys & Girls 
Club in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 After 2 1/2 days of deliberations, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury convicted 
Damian Vann, 18, in the Jan. 9, 1993, slaying of Tiffany Dozier, a 
seventh-grade student at Maclay Middle School.He faces a maximum of 20 years to 
life in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for a ride home from a dance at the club, Tiffany was shot in 
the back after a fight broke out among rival gang members. Vann, who was a 
juvenile at the time of the shooting but was ordered to stand trial as an 
adult, admitted his role in the slaying, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. John 
Nantroup. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said the evidence included Vann's "statement to police that he 
did shoot into the crowd." Vann claimed that he fired in self-defense after 
hearing a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun used to kill Tiffany, a .32-caliber semiautomatic handgun, was turned 
in by one of Vann's friends after Vann called the boy during a police 
interview, according to Los Angeles Police Detective Gary Holbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who apparently fired a shot into the air seconds before Tiffany was 
hit, Tremayne Stevenson, 21, of North Hollywood, pleaded guilty last year to 
negligently discharging a firearm and was sentenced to probation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PUBLIC'S 
HELP SOUGHT IN SEARCH FOR MAN'S KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Detectives are hoping that someone will come forward with information to help 
them find a robber who killed a man as he was celebrating his daughter's 15th 
birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 Ismael Peralta Salinas, 40, was fatally wounded about 6:20 p.m. Saturday at 
his home in the 1900 block of West Manchester Avenue, said Detective Rudy Lemos 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's South Bureau.  
</P>
<P>
 Peralta's 16- and 18-year-old sons witnessed the crime, Lemos said. In 
addition to the three teen-agers, Peralta is survived by his wife and two other 
children, ages 1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was celebrating the daughter's birthday when the suspect came to 
their door and was allowed to enter the home. "The suspect begged (Peralta) for 
some change . . . (then asked) if he wanted to buy some jewelry," Lemos said. 
Peralta told the man he did not have the money to buy the items, but would give 
him some change, Lemos said. The suspect then pulled out a revolver and 
demanded Peralta's money. "When (Peralta) did not cooperate, the suspect forced 
(him) to his knees and executed him," Lemos said.  
</P>
<P>
 The gunman took about $150 from Peralta and left the house, Lemos said. He 
fled across Manchester Avenue and was joined by another man. He was described 
as 5 feet 8 inches to 5 feet 9 inches tall, about 30 to 38 years old, with 
medium to dark skin, a light beard and "jheri-curl" hair from his mid-forehead, 
around his ears to the middle of his neck. He wore dark-colored pants and a 
light shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The other suspect was described as also being 5 feet, 8 inches to 5 feet, 9 
inches tall and about 30 to 38 years old, but with a lighter skin tone than the 
gunman's. He was clean-shaven, had a short, Afro-style haircut and wore soiled 
clothing, Lemos said.

AFTERSHOCK RATTLES RESIDENTS OVER WIDE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A magnitude 3.7 aftershock of the Northridge quake rumbled through the Los 
Angeles metropolitan area Wednesday night, rattling china cupboards and 
startling thousands of residents but apparently causing no injuries or major 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock, which struck at 8:27 p.m., was centered about a mile southwest 
of the city of San Fernando, according to Caltech seismologist Riley Geary. The 
temblor was felt throughout the San Fernando Valley, in Downtown Los Angeles, 
Hollywood and the Santa Monica and Venice areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists said there have been more than 8,000 substantial aftershocks of 
the devastating Jan. 17 quake.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 
STATE PANEL DELAYS DECISION ON FREEWAY EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission postponed a controversial decision on 
the Long Beach Freeway extension Wednesday after learning that a survey of 
historic buildings along the proposed route had not been properly reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 State Historic Preservation Officer Cherilyn Widell told commissioners they 
should not act on the proposed route until her office had an opportunity to 
review a Caltrans survey of buildings considered eligible for inclusion on the 
National Registry of Historic Buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Widell said she legally has 30 days to review the report and determine what 
position her office will take. Widell's appearance before the commission 
prompted one commissioner, Daniel Fessler, to suggest that there appears to be 
some division within the Wilson Administration over the freeway extension. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while the Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, acting 
through Caltrans, was advocating an immediate decision, the Resources Agency, 
which oversees the State Historic Preservation Office, was seeking a delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration ought to get its position straight before we act on this," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues agreed and postponed consideration of the project until July. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting of the commission was to have been the last battle at the 
state level for a project that has been bitterly contested for more than 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension of the Long Beach Freeway would run for 6.2 miles through Los 
Angeles, Alhambra, South Pasadena and Pasadena between the San Bernardino and 
Foothill freeways. The commission has voted on the extension twice before, but 
never on this route.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SOME 
PUPILS KEPT AT HOME TO PROTEST GAY PRIDE EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Student absenteeism was higher than normal at several schools in the east San 
Fernando Valley and the Harbor area, where some parents kept their children out 
of class to protest Gay and Lesbian Pride Month in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education approved a 1992 resolution encouraging schools to 
recognize the contributions of gays and lesbians in society.Parents and 
Students United in the Valley circulated letters urging parents to participate 
in "Opt Out Day" by keeping their children out of school June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials said Brainard Avenue and Herrick Avenue elementary 
schools in the northeast Valley and four elementary schools in the Harbor area 
-- Halldale Avenue, Gulf Avenue, 7th Street and Leland Street -- reported a 
high number of student absences. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay Pride Month is mostly recognized in high schools and typically involves 
gay and lesbian guest speakers who meet with social studies classes or groups 
of interested students, school officials said.

COLISEUM REPAIRS TO COST AT LEAST 20% OVER BUDGET; QUAKE AFTERMATH: THE 
INCREASE FROM THE FIRST ESTIMATE OF $35 MILLION TO$42 MILLION, OR EVEN MORE, IS

 Earthquake repairs at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will cost at least $42 
million and probably $44.5 million, an increase of 20% or more beyond the $35 
million originally estimated, the Coliseum Commission's project director said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Don C. Webb, addressing the commission's monthly meeting, declared, however, 
that the project remains "on pace" for a substantial completion by the first 
USC and Raider home games in September. The main contractor, Ronald Tutor, 
concurred, saying, "I'm confident we will open Sept. 3" for the USC-Washington 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' Coliseum opener is scheduled for Sept. 11 against the Seattle 
Seahawks, unless the team follows through on one of various flirtations with 
other cities and leaves Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Lazzaro, a USC vice president emeritus who represents the university 
at commission meetings, said USC is confident that close to a regular capacity 
of 68,000 seats will be ready for its opening game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, apparently unrepresented at the meeting, did not return a phone 
call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said the costs have increased for four primary reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Drilling seismic reinforcing piles as deep as 92 feet has required more 
labor and machinery than first expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * The porous nature of existing concrete has required a huge amount of 
high-strength epoxy, costing $100 a gallon to seal approximately 10,000 cracks 
caused by the earthquake. Already, 700 gallons of the resin-polymer mixture has 
been used, and several hundred more gallons will be required. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Fire Department has mandated that sprinklers be installed on 
the upper concourse level of the stadium, as well as other expensive new safety 
features. 
</P>
<P>
 * It has become obvious that the press box has been damaged beyond repair, and 
a decision is close on demolishing it, building temporary press seating for 
next fall and constructing a permanent new press box once historic preservation 
groups approve. 
</P>
<P>
 This is likely to add about $2.5 million to the minimum new projected repair 
cost of $42 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb added that even these new estimates are not solid and that costs could 
increase even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacement of the stadium's video screens above the damaged peristyle may 
also be necessary and would cost even more, he said, although repairs of the 
historic peristyle are included in the $42-million new budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said that, so far, representatives of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, which is putting up 90% of the money for the repairs, have indicated 
that they are committed to finishing the project. And the state has committed 
to the other 10%. So he is optimistic that financing will be available for 
everything needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Coliseum officials said, the cost of Coliseum repairs exceeds the 
$30-million cost of repairing the quake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor and consultant Larry A. Wiggs, meanwhile, told the commission that much 
progress has been made at achieving very substantial ethnic and racial 
representation among the 400-member work force making the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of all the money spent is going to more than a dozen minority 
subcontractors, Tutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggs said that, not even counting the labor force of the minority 
contractors, about 35% of Tutor-Saliba's own work force on the project is 
African American, 38% is Latino and 27% is white or Asian.

TUG OF WAR OVER COUNTY BUDGET GETS UNDER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public hearings on the new Los Angeles County budget began Wednesday with 
department heads, advocacy groups and private citizens alike pleading for more 
money and restoration of programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The $14.2-billion budget submitted to the Board of Supervisors by Chief 
Administrative Officer Sally Reed calls for about 1,100 layoffs and the closing 
of many libraries, parks and museums. It also includes a $184-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will hold several days of public hearings before it begins the 
difficult task of reconciling competing demands for money and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the board's work is done. Before the hearings began, supervisors 
forged deals that will maintain funding in departments headed by two powerful 
elected officials -- Sheriff Sherman Block and Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti was guaranteed about the same level of funding as last year, plus a 
share of Proposition 172 tax funds. In return, he agreed to keep intact several 
specialized prosecution units, such as those that handle workers' compensation 
fraud and environmental crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed had proposed lopping $60 million from the sheriff's budget, but the 
supervisors quickly restored $45 million. Block told the supervisors Wednesday 
that he could make up the $15 million difference by cutting operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The board still faces a daunting challenge as it attempts to finalize a budget 
that relies on revenue that may not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 State legislators could garnish county tax revenues or impose new mandates on 
the county in an effort to balance the state's own shaky budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, a major source of revenue in Reed's proposed budget is $150 
million that would be withdrawn from the Los Angeles County Employees 
Retirement Assn. But that plan has met with some resistance from supervisors 
and pension officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some uncertainties in terms of federal funds and what to anticipate 
from the state," said board Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. "There are a 
lot of things that still have to be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "But I was very pleased with the tenor of the meeting today. There 
is a good feeling of cooperation and of a constructive approach to solving 
these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the board's looming headaches were highlighted when representatives of 
the county's largest labor union demanded an independent audit of the budget to 
identify sources of revenue that could be used to eliminate the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand was inspired by the board's decision to take $45 million from a 
little-known reserve fund and give it to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found money for the sheriff, so we feel like they have some alternatives 
that they haven't explored," said Linda Ramos, a clerk in the county tax 
collector's office. She was among about 250 county workers who held a rousing 
march in front of the Hall of Administration to protest cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Cedillo, general manager of Service Employees Union Local 660, which 
represents about half of the county's 84,000-member work force, told the board 
that employees "are committed to working with you, but we will not allow you to 
balance the budget on our backs." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedillo asked that the board reject any cuts that would force the county to 
sacrifice revenue from state or federal programs and demanded that the board 
order an inventory of county-owned property to determine if sale or lease of 
the properties could reduce the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Other speakers addressed proposed cutbacks in county health and welfare 
programs, the Probation Department and the Department of Animal Care and 
Control. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen supporters of animal care services presented the board with 
10,000 petitions opposing the proposed closure of the Castaic animal care 
center. Department chief Frank R. Andrews asked the board to restore $1 million 
to his department. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the wildfires in Malibu, we rescued 1,400 animals, many of them horses 
that could have added to problems of fighting the fires," Andrews said. "Under 
the proposed staffing levels, I don't know if we would have that capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 Budget hearings will continue through this week and possibly into next. The 
board is scheduled to begin budget deliberations July 11.

GRANTS ACCELERATE PLANS FOR NEW TYPE OF SCHOOL; EDUCATION: CORPORATE DONATIONS 
OF $237,000 PAVE THE WAY FOR SOUTH-CENTRAL CAMPUS THAT WILL HAVE SOME AUTONOMY 
FROM THE DISTRICT. CURRICULUM IS DESIGNED TO BOOST ACHIEVEMENT OF AT-RISK 
STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thanks to $237,000 in corporate grants, local educators are within sight of 
their goal to open a radically new elementary school this fall that will 
receive public funds but be financially and academically independent from the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Accelerated School, as it will be called, will be one of the first 
storefront public schools in California, offering regular classes at a leased 
site in South-Central Los Angeles or in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a $207,000 grant from Wells Fargo Bank, the Weingart Foundation 
has pledged $30,000 to help pay for the school's start-up costs. The 
180-student school will receive normal per-pupil funding from the district plus 
money for special programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the largest grant at the kindergarten-through-12th-grade level that 
Wells Fargo has ever given, so it's a very significant grant," said Tim Hanlon, 
vice president of the San Francisco-based bank. "We were impressed with this 
proposal because the money will not go toward just bricks and mortar. It will 
be incorporating the whole idea of school reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's curriculum will be patterned after the Accelerated Schools Model, 
which was developed at Stanford University and is designed to boost the 
achievement of at-risk students by requiring all students to learn the same 
material. The model is being used at 99th Street School in South-Central, where 
the Accelerated School's organizers now teach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The instructional model is certainly sound," said Joseph Rao, administrative 
coordinator of the Los Angeles school district's office of school reform. "But 
you need a lot of business acumen to run a school, and you also need a lot of 
energy to attract parents and make the school a success." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the nine other charter schools the Board of Education has approved, the 
Accelerated School will have considerable autonomy. Some schools have hired new 
teachers, set different salaries, developed innovative curricula and adopted 
their own rules and budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking school reform a step further," said Johnathan Williams, a 
teacher at 99th Street Elementary and co-director of the Accelerated School. 
"We're so overcrowded that educators need to look at new alternatives. We need 
schools in churches, businesses and storefronts." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board gave conditional approval to the Accelerated School charter 
proposal in November, but would not give its final approval until the school's 
organizers raised $200,000. The school board must approve the school site 
before it can open. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district required us to have $200,000, and now we have more than that," 
Williams said. "We also have a number of other grants that we're waiting on. If 
we can come up with $300,000, we'll be ready to open in September." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1992 Charter School Act, which took effect last year, as many as 100 
schools in California and 10 in any district can achieve charter status, which 
continues the school's public funding but frees it from state and local 
education regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other charter schools in California are operating at independent sites. 
Lazear Middle School in Oakland, now known as the Jingletown School, operates 
out of a church basement, while a dropout charter program, Options for Youth, 
holds classes at a leased building in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of the charter school is to experiment and to see all kinds of 
stuff," said David Patterson, an education consultant with the state Department 
of Education. "This is about inventing new ways to educate."

RIORDAN VETOES COUNCIL'S AMENDMENTS; SPENDING: MAYOR SAYS EXTRA FUNDS FOR PARKS 
AND LIBRARIES WOULD DEPLETE RESERVES. MEMBERS HAVE FIVE DAYS TO OVERRIDE HIS 
DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Saying that the city's reserves would be cut to dangerously low levels, Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Wednesday sharply reduced or eliminated 
library, park and street sweeping services that the City Council had added to 
his budget proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan issued his veto, the first of his 11-month tenure, on 13 budget 
amendments by the City Council. The council has five days to override him and 
restore the programs if it can muster a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot support the expansion proposed by the council," Riordan said in his 
veto message, "until I have greater confidence in our revenue projections and 
in the will of the council to join with me in the tough measures that lie ahead 
to sustain these revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he supports the social and recreational services added by the 
City Council but that they would reduce the city's reserves to $9 million. 
Riordan had proposed a $38-million reserve before the city lawmakers added $12 
million in new and augmented programs. Another $17 million was cut from the 
financial cushion when a city pension board rejected Riordan's proposal to 
reduce contributions to the pension system. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said during budget deliberations last month that they 
supported the mayor's expansion of the Police Department, but that they wanted 
to expand library and park services to combat crime by providing alternatives 
for young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan cut those expenditures in half: from $4 million to $2 million for 
parks and from $3.2 million to more than $1.6 million for libraries. In his 
veto message, the mayor said he would like to support the additional spending 
but that the city cannot afford the "permanent and usually escalating" cost of 
additional park and library workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In other veto actions, Riordan cut in half the $750,000 expenditure for 
recruiting more female police officers, $356,000 for increased street sweeping, 
half of the funds for hiring new animal regulation officers (a $173,000 
savings), two artist-calligraphers who make plaques and commendations for 
citizens and dignitaries (a $99,000 savings), $65,000 to provide handguns and 
training for City Hall security officers, and $371,000 to improve the Planning 
Department's drafting of environmental impact reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they were likely to fight most adamantly for the park and 
library programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these cuts are particularly disastrous when we look at the need for 
recreation," Councilwoman Rita Walters said. "I can't think of two better 
places for kids to occupy themselves and stay out of trouble than parks and 
libraries." 
</P>
<P>
 But the toughest fight in the final chapter of the budget saga may be whether 
the city should make a special appropriation to the fledgling Hope in Youth 
anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan initially proposed a $5-million appropriation for the church-based 
program, which plans to send social workers throughout the city. The council 
amended the proposal and said the group should compete with others for funds. 
In the veto message, Riordan said $2.5 million should be set aside for Hope in 
Youth and $2.5 million more put up for competition among various anti-gang 
programs.

LAPD SEX HARASSMENT PANEL BACKED; LAW ENFORCEMENT: CITY COUNCIL APPROVES 
CIVILIAN UNIT TO REVIEW COMPLAINTS AGAINST POLICE BY OTHER OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Saying that police investigators have failed to root out wrongdoing in their 
own ranks, the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday called for formation of a 
civilian unit to review sexual harassment and discrimination complaints within 
the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes after several weeks of hearings and reports by female 
officers that they felt they had nowhere to turn for help when they were 
taunted or physically accosted by male officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will send a message . . . that this is not acceptable behavior and it 
will be dealt with swiftly and expeditiously," said Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, who proposed the unit. "If women don't have anything to complain 
about, then they will stay on the job longer and be better recruiters of others 
coming on the force." 
</P>
<P>
 Abby J. Leibman of the California Women's Law Center hailed the unanimous 
council vote as a "sign that this is an issue that is being taken seriously . . 
. to eradicate sexual harassment within the Police Department and the community 
as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg and others have said the city is being hampered in recruiting and 
retaining women for the Police Department because of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's recommendation goes to the Police Commission, which must give 
final approval to the civilian review unit. The commission is independent from 
the council, but commission members have said they would support an independent 
review panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit was initially proposed to handle sexual harassment complaints, but it 
was modified to also encompass complaints of discrimination based on race, 
religion, sexual orientation and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit would break with tradition by reporting directly to the civilian 
Police Commission, rather than to Police Chief Willie L. Williams. Williams had 
asked remain in charge of the investigations and discipline. He did not comment 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 To assuage concerns that members of the new organization will not understand 
the policy and culture of the department, the council agreed that at least one 
police officer would be on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Protective League had proposed that a unit outside the department 
investigate sexual harassment claims, Goldberg said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; DEMOCRATS' FIGHT TAKES NASTY 
TURN; MARGOLIN ADS ATTACK TORRES ON HIS CONVICTIONS FOR DRUNK DRIVING. TORRES 
ACCUSES MARGOLIN OF TAKING CAMPAIGN MONEY FROM VESTED INTERESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Democratic primary fight for insurance commissioner has turned nasty in 
the final days of campaigning, with Assemblyman Burt Margolin citing Sen. Art 
Torres' drunk-driving convictions and Torres accusing Margolin of taking 
campaign money from vested interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Margolin picked up the endorsements of Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Gloria Molina and consumer advocate Ralph Nader. Nader is one of the 
architects of Proposition 103, the 1988 initiative that made the insurance 
commissioner's job elective and created the tough regulatory system for 
insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is just no comparison in terms of (Margolin's) proven record of 
defiance of the insurance industry," Nader said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got word of Nader's endorsement of Margolin, Torres called on Nader to 
reconsider. In a letter to Nader, Torres pointed to "nearly $20,000" in 
campaign contributions to Margolin that came from lawyers who represent 
insurance companies, and others with ties to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres told Nader in the letter that he has taken no insurance industry money 
since he assumed chairmanship of the Senate Insurance Committee two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Nader said Wednesday that he stood by his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the insurance companies are giving him money, they're getting nothing in 
return," Nader said from Washington, where he is based. 
</P>
<P>
 On both the Democratic and Republican sides, the primary contests for 
insurance commissioner are among the most hotly contested on Tuesday's ballot. 
The next commissioner is certain to face weighty issues, ranging from how to 
handle health care reform to how to hold down company rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope Warschaw, Margolin's campaign manager, acknowledged that Margolin has 
taken donations from lawyers, including some who represent insurance companies 
with cases pending in the courts against the Department of Insurance. But she 
said Torres also has taken money from firms and lawyers with insurance ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Torres is obviously desperate," Warschaw said. "He thinks this Nader 
endorsement is a big deal, and he wants to draw public attention away from the 
drunk driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, who has represented the Eastside as a legislator since 1974, enters 
the final weekend with a lead in public opinion polls -- and the endorsements 
from much of the Democratic Establishment, including the Democratic Party, 
which donated $65,000 to him, and the California Teachers Assn., which gave him 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin, who has represented the Westside since 1982, was using his war chest 
to air radio spots attacking Torres for his record of two drunk-driving 
convictions, the most recent of which was in 1990. It is a point Republicans 
are certain to home in on in November if Torres wins on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's desperation tactics," Dario Frommer, Torres' campaign manager, said of 
Margolin's attack. "It's old news. Art has been honest about it. He talks 
openly about his recovery. He hasn't had a drink for five years." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Republican side, Assemblyman Chuck Quackenbush (R-Cupertino), the most 
well-funded of the GOP candidates for insurance commissioner, aired his first 
television commercial in Los Angeles. The 10-second spot is designed to 
introduce the Silicon Valley lawmaker to Southern California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 It identifies Quackenbush as "co-author" of the "three strikes and you're out" 
anti-crime bill. The legislation signed into law this year to sentence felons 
to life in prison had several co-authors in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush's campaign received a $200,000 loan from Pacific Loan 
Administrators in Menlo Park. The company has donated another $5,000 to him. He 
also took $10,000 from Fremont Compensation, a workers' compensation insurance 
firm, and $5,000 from ACHD Insurance Co., an insurance brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Conran, another Republican seeking the nomination, took to the air with a 
radio commercial that identifies him as former director of the Department of 
Consumer Affairs. The spot cites his investigation of 72 Sears auto repair 
shops, which resulted in Sears paying $8 million to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now Jim Conran is running for insurance commissioner. He wants to go after 
crooked companies, phony claims and unfair rates," the narrator says.

 The Santa Ana Valley High School boys' basketball team will play a 
home-and-home series with two-time State Division I champion Los Angeles 
Crenshaw, Falcon Coach Rich Prospero said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons will play at Crenshaw next season.Crenshaw will play at Santa Ana 
Valley during the 1995-96 season. It will be the first time Crenshaw has played 
a non-tournament game in Orange County, according to Cougar Coach Willie West. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, which has won six State titles, defeated Carmichael Jesuit, 89-79, 
to win the State title this season. The Cougars defeated Jesuit, 73-66, in 
1993. Crenshaw has defeated Mater Dei in the Southern California Regional final 
the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley, led by All-Orange County guard Olujimi Mann, lost to La 
Crescenta Crescenta Valley, 69-67, in the Southern Section I-AA semifinals this

CHATSWORTH RALLIES AS MURPHY AWAKENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Memo from the Chatsworth High coaching staff to slumping catcher Brandon 
Murphy: 
</P>
<P>
 Get your head out of the sand. Get the bats out of your belfry. Or something 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd been thinking too much up there," Chatsworth Coach Tom Meusborn said. 
"We told him to just get the bat head out front." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Chancellors' stunning 11-10 victory over Birmingham in a City 
Section 4-A Division quarterfinal Wednesday at Chatsworth, Murphy must now get 
his head out of the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's two-out, run-scoring single capped a three-run rally in the bottom of 
the seventh as top-seeded Chatsworth pulled the rug from under upset-minded 
Birmingham.  
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Chancellors (27-4) will face West Valley League rival Taft in 
the semifinals Friday at a neutral site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the sixth inning, when Murphy contributed a single as the Chancellors 
scored three times to pare the Braves' lead to 10-8, precious little had gone 
right. Which pretty much covers Murphy's production heading into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been doing much of anything up there lately," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fateful seventh began with Birmingham clinging to a two-run lead. Tiring 
Birmingham reliever Jamie Darnell (5-2) recorded the first out on a line drive 
to left, but Mike Amado singled and Eric Rovner followed with a roller up the 
middle that had double play written all over it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Birmingham failed to record even one out when shortstop Todd 
Challgren took his eye off the ball and dropped it for an error. The immensity 
of the play was not difficult to gauge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was huuuge ," Meusborn said. 
</P>
<P>
 A groundout by Rod Daryabigi advanced the runners to set the stage for 
Daryabigi's twin brother, Ray. Ray cashed in the error by launching a two-run 
double into the gap in left-center, sending Darnell for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't give up until the last three outs of the seventh inning," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, in this case? "Four outs," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Pedro Rodriguez walked Bryan LaCour intentionally before grooving a 
first-pitch fastball to Murphy, who whacked a single to left that took a bad 
bounce over the head of Steve Brown to put a cap on the frenetic ending. It was 
Murphy's third consecutive hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think after that first hit, I started feeling it," said Murphy, who was 
three for five. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a numbing afternoon, at least in the early stages. Birmingham (15-14) 
buried Chatsworth starter Jim DeBiase (10-3) by jumping to a 7-4 lead with a 
six-run fourth.  
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase was charged with all seven runs, five earned. Before the Chatsworth 
offense kicked in, the Braves held a 10-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho-hum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, we've had our backs against the wall like this five or six times already 
this year," Meusborn said, smiling. "Somehow, we've found a way."

 METROLINK: Two people fled their stalled car in Pacoima on Wednesday just 
before a Metrolink train plowed into it (B1). That makes 21 incidents, 
including 17 fatalities, since Metrolink started in October, 1992. But those 
numbers are consistent with other commuter train services in the U.S., says 
spokesman Peter Hidalgo. . . . "We're the new kids on the block, and that's why 
we're hot news," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 YOUNG 60: Old age has never looked so good on anyone -- no, not even Dick 
Clark. He's Donald Duck, and next week, he turns 60. Donald, another Disney 
creation, is recognized for his raspy voice and hot temper. . . . And today, 
he's more popular than ever. "Donald has universal appeal," said Ken Green, a 
Disney spokesman in Burbank. "He's in Eastern Europe and Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 D-DAY: For Roger Worley, D-day isn't about the invasion that took place 50 
years ago. Rather, his big D stands for today's amateur baseball draft, and 
Worley (above), a senior pitcher for Quartz Hill High in Antelope Valley, 
should be a high selection. . . . Worley isn't alone. Other area players are 
expected to be drafted early (C10). 
</P>
<P>
 GRADUATION: The quake has affected everything else at Cal State Northridge 
this semester, so it's only fitting that graduation has to be shifted around as 
well. So, instead of the usual spot near the campus library, separate 
commencements will be held next week at the University Club and North Campus 
Stadium. . . . In 1992, the school staged one ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl, 
but it caused a huge traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
 PARADE MYSTERY: Leave it to Topanga. The town is still buzzing over Monday's 
Memorial Day Parade, when two men and three women, wearing only brown paint, 
loincloths and leaves, rode atop a float entry called the "Topanga Tribal 
Village." (B3) . . . One problem, though. People can't find out who they were. 
"It's driving everyone crazy!" said Linda Cochrane, manager of Topanga Video. 
"They were fun." Michael Arkush

EX-DEPUTY AMONG 3 ACCUSED OF CHEATING AT CASINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three people, including a former Orange County Sheriff's deputy, won more than 
$100,000 over three days before they were stopped and accused of cheating at 
blackjack at the new Casino Windsor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Dancey, 56, of West Bloomfield, Ontario; Christopher Zalis, 29, of 
Marlton, N.J.; and Karen Conroy, 28, of State College, Pa., were arrested 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Casino officials told The Detroit News that they became suspicious when the 
three wagered widely varying amounts on different hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Zalis gambled, while Dancey and Conroy sat at the table and used a bead system 
to illegally count cards, Canadian authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan Martini, of the Orange County Sheriff's Department, said that Dancey's 
employment records had been routinely destroyed but that she worked 
"off-and-on" as a deputy from 1967 to 1984, mostly as a matron in women's jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancey's departures from the job appeared to be "self-terminations," without 
incident, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Sgt. John White of the Ontario Provincial Police casino squad said 
officers "began to watch these individuals over a couple of days. . . . Our 
belief is they used devices in counting and keeping track of high-value cards." 
</P>
<P>
 The three face court hearings July 18 on charges of conspiracy to cheat at 
play and cheating at play. The charges carry up to two years in prison. The 
three are free on $5,000 bond each.

STATE SENDS SPECIALISTS TO HELP WITH TB OUTBREAK; HEALTH: EXPERTS ON 
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES ARRIVE AFTER RENEWED THREAT FROM DRUG-RESISTANT STRAIN 
THAT HAS PLAGUED LA QUINTA HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State experts on communicable disease arrived in Orange County Wednesday to 
help county health officials sharpen plans for handling the tuberculosis 
outbreak at La Quinta High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepped-up role for the state is due in part to officials' belief that 20 
people have been exposed to a student who suffered a recent relapse of a highly 
drug-resistant strain of TB. Almost 200 students and staff members were already 
being treated before the new cases started appearing in February. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the renewed threat, the county next week will retest most of 
the Westminster school's 1,300 students and staff, in an undertaking similar to 
the massive skin testing completed there last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Jackson, chief of state's division of communicable disease 
control, said he sent a physician with expertise in epidemiology and a public 
health adviser to carefully review the case of Debi French, a senior who in 
February suffered a relapse of contagious TB although she insists that she was 
taking her daily medication. French had a strain of TB that is multi-drug 
resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot to learn when these medications fail," Jackson said. "And we 
need to figure out where we go from here. . . . We are interested in looking at 
the extent of this problem and stopping this outbreak." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the state will be acting in an advisory capacity to the County 
Health Care Agency, which has primary responsibility for countering the 
outbreak of tuberculosis discovered last year at La Quinta. Seventeen La Quinta 
students are being treated for active TB and 175 others, who tested positive 
for exposure to the bacteria, are receiving medication to prevent their 
developing the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, 18 more students and two staff members at the school who were 
in contact with French between December and February, when she relapsed, have 
tested positive for TB bacteria. There is concern that this makes them 
vulnerable to the same multi-drug-resistant TB strain that forced French to 
have part of a lung removed last month in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the county's chief public health officer, said that at 
Jackson's request he already had decided to devote a physician full time to 
coordinate the TB control effort at La Quinta.  
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said Dr. Jodi Meador, the county's TB controller, will head a 
medical team charged with carrying out the TB screening and devising a plan for 
tracking students who are found to have latent or active TB. The county wants 
to be certain all receive proper medication and follow-up testing to catch any 
relapses. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most of the TB cases and positive exposures have been in the senior 
class, where the first multi-drug-resistant case was identified, Stallworth 
said Meador's team must devise ways to track graduates who move out of the area 
to enter the work force or attend college. Health officials want to be certain 
that all cases are monitored by local health agencies and school health 
organizations to ensure that the patients follow their treatment regimen. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Health Care Agency recently was authorized to fill 29 new positions 
to cope with the recent countywide increase in tuberculosis, Stallworth said 
the agency will be understaffed during the hiring process. He has asked the 
state Department of Health Services to assist him in finding physicians with 
experience in treating tuberculosis who can fill in temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is ready to help. "I want the La Quinta episode to be very closely 
watched by the local health department," said Jackson, who has been conferring 
with Stallworth on almost a daily basis from his Sacramento office.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to have both a physician and epidemiologist focused very closely on 
this. If they do not have an adequate staff of physicians, I want to help them 
find the physicians," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he also has instructed his staff to investigate the records of 
the La Quinta outbreak "to see if there are episodes where cases had been 
medically mismanaged." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his concerns, he said, is about a report by the federal Centers for 
Disease Control that the outbreak at the school might have been prevented if 
the first case of drug-resistant tuberculosis had been more promptly diagnosed 
and reported to the county and the patient's treatment had been more closely 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 The state agency will determine whether any physicians should be referred to 
the state medical board for discipline, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Given the seriousness of this illness, physicians need to adhere to their 
public health responsibilities," he said. "You can offer all the continuing 
medical education courses you want, but sometimes it is time to be more 
forceful."

113,000 SIGNATURES BACK EL TORO AIRPORT VOTE; BASE REUSE: SUPPORTERS OF 
COMMERCIAL FACILITY SAY VOTERS SHOULD DECIDE ISSUE IN NOVEMBER. THEY CITE 
POTENTIAL FOR JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Promising that it would lead to thousands of jobs, supporters of a proposed 
initiative to require converting the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to a 
commercial airport filed a 113,000-signature petition Wednesday to put the 
measure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the initiative needed to collect 66,703 valid signatures of 
registered voters by Wednesday to qualify the proposal -- called the Orange 
County/El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative -- for the general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by voters, the proposal would change the county's land-use plan to 
allow the development of a commercial airport at El Toro on 2,000 acres of the 
4,700-acre base and require the building of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is sponsored by a coalition of business and political leaders who 
are relying on the jobs issue to carry the day. The group calls itself 
Committee for 21,000 New Jobs and contends that a new airport would create 
21,645 new jobs in Orange County and generate $170 million annually for local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Newport Beach businessman George L. Argyros and Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), two high-profile initiative supporters, said 
they are siding with blue-collar workers in their backing of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to stand up for the working people of this county?" Rohrabacher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros, who made millions as a developer, said a commercial airport at El 
Toro that could also handle cargo "will create a job machine that will last 100 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that Argyros and his group were pushing boxes of signed 
petitions into the County Registrar of Voters office, another group of business 
leaders and elected officials were holding their own news conference across 
town to announce opposition to the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the group stressed that they do not oppose the idea of building a 
commercial airport at El Toro. Rather, they said it would be unwise to decide 
the base's future at the ballot box rather than through an orderly and complete 
planning process, which the county is currently doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to mandating building of the airport, the proposed ballot measure 
would set up a 13-member advisory commission made up of elected officials, 
aviation experts, private citizens and representatives from labor and business 
groups to advise the Board of Supervisors on building the airport and 
developing the rest of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the initiative said they do not trust the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority -- the county agency sanctioned to study redevelopment options for 
the base -- to make an unbiased decision on whether to convert the Marine base 
to a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member county board includes four representatives from Irvine and 
Lake Forest, where opposition to the proposed airport is strong. Rohrabacher 
labeled opponents of the initiative "a vocal minority watching out for their 
own interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters expressed confidence that the measure will qualify for the ballot 
and brushed aside a recent Times Orange County Poll that showed almost 60% of 
local voters opposed the initiative. However, they acknowledged that, so far, 
voters are not swayed by promises that a new airport would lead to more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's vital that we talk directly to the voters and let them know what the 
issues are," Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative backers argued Wednesday that the measure is necessary because all 
county residents deserve a voice in the decision about El Toro's future. 
Presently, the base's future is being discussed only in concert with issues 
that affect surrounding cities like Irvine and Lake Forest, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this really a local issue or a regional issue?" said Argyros. "We need to 
let all voters of Orange County participate in this debate." 
</P>
<P>
 But initiative opponents, including Laguna Hills businessman Bill Kogerman and 
Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow, said they supported the county planning 
authority's plan to study various reuse proposals in conjunction with local 
municipalities and business groups before making a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed initiative is bad government," said Kogerman, co-chair of the 
group, which billed itself as "grass roots." "The whole idea of land planning 
through an initiative is totally inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Others at Wednesday's news conference held by opponents echoed that view, 
including Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who helped develop the county-sponsored 
planning authority for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the (county) organization's goal is to come up with the best land 
use," Riley said. "We want to do the best planning job." 
</P>
<P>
 Group members noted that the county process calls for open public meetings and 
that a final reuse decision would be made by a panel of elected officials.

POLICE SEEK SUSPECT IN SHOOTING OF SECURITY GUARD; INVESTIGATION: 'EXTREMELY 
DANGEROUS' MAN SERVED 11 YEARS FOR BANK ROBBERIES AND IS A FORMER L.A. COUNTY 
SHERIFF'S DEPUTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, who served 11 years in prison 
for a series of bank robberies, was sought by police Wednesday in connection 
with the shooting of a security guard in a supermarket parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, Stephen Moreland Redd, 49, is described as "an extremely 
dangerous man with an exceptionally violent background and no regard for 
positions of authority," said police Lt. Timm Browne. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that a uniformed security guard was sent to a Vons parking lot in 
the 2600 block of North Tustin Street at 10:40 p.m. Tuesday to investigate 
reports of a suspicious-looking person in a long brown wig. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard approached the man, who was "nervous and uncooperative," Browne 
said. At that point, a second guard arrived and the man fired several shots, 
hitting the second guard in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The man fled to a nearby apartment complex where his van was parked. The 
license plate led police to a Fullerton address, which police linked to Redd. 
</P>
<P>
 Redd was a deputy from 1967 to 1973, when he resigned for personal reasons, 
according to personnel records. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Redd shot a La Habra police officer in the leg after robbing a 
Security Pacific Bank branch and then led police on a car chase through three 
counties before being captured. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sentenced to 18 years in prison for a series of bank robberies 
committed that fall, said Art Lucero, spokesman for the state Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, he tried to climb over a fence at the California Men's Colony in San 
Luis Obispo and was shot in the arm by prison guards, Lucero said. A year and 
four months was added to his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Redd was released from prison in April, 1993, and had been a self-employed 
construction worker. His parole officer last saw him on May 22 at home. Redd 
has been under psychiatric counseling as a condition of his parole, Lucero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was under pretty close supervision," Lucero said. "We didn't have any 
parole violations on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's shooting was the third serious shooting incident involving unarmed 
private security guards in Orange County in just over three months. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 19, Dagoberto Carrero was shot and killed in a barrage of gunfire as 
he stood at his post inside the lobby of the Century City Centre Theatre in 
Orange. Carrero, a 23-year-old former Marine and a Persian Gulf War veteran, 
worked for Patrol One, the same company as the guard injured in the most recent 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Santa Ana men subsequently were charged with first-degree murder in 
connection with the Carrero shooting, which police said stemmed from an earlier 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 20, 19-year-old Rupert Morales was shot and killed as he tried to 
direct a car into a parking space at a Garden Grove bar in the 8000 block of 
Garden Grove Boulevard. No arrests have been made, and an investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bancroft, owner of Patrol One, said shootings are a "major concern" that 
were discussed extensively Wednesday at his Orange-based firm, which deploys 
more than 80 unarmed guards at gated communities, high-rise office buildings, 
shopping centers and apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arming his guards is an issue he has grappled with for some time, Bancroft 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While clients may not like the idea of guards carrying guns, job applicants 
are troubled about patrolling without them, Bancroft said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it very explicitly," he said. "We've lost employees today because 
we're unarmed. . . . Word gets around." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne said police find Redd's background particularly troubling because he is 
a "treacherous type of criminal who has the know-how to be extremely 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Redd is white, 6 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds and has a shaved head. He is 
clean-shaven and has blue eyes. At the time of the shooting, the man police 
believe was Redd was wearing the long wig, a cap and a blue, hooded sweat shirt 
with a zippered front. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about Redd's whereabouts is asked to call the Orange 
Police Department at (714) 744-7444.

 The Orange County Grand Jury urged local leaders Wednesday to take control of 
the decade-long problem of jail overcrowding, warning that further delay could 
seriously erode the future effectiveness of law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury found a shortage of 3,615 beds in the county system, which has 
resulted in the release or turning away of "tens of thousands" of people who 
would normally spend time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the therapeutic effects of jail are denied to too many people who deserve 
it, then the threat of jail as a means of social control becomes hollow," the 
report stated. "The issue cannot be avoided. The county's leadership must deal 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 As possible starting points, jurors suggested that the El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station, scheduled for closure in 1999, be considered as a site for a 
future county lockup. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the federal government opts to build a prison at the Marine base, what 
better opportunity could be asked for the county?" the grand jury said. 
"Parochial interests aside, imagine a county jail nestled up to a federal 
prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no source of revenue has been identified to pay for such 
construction, jurors urged that all possibilities be explored, including the 
most politically unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 "This leads us to taxes, the dreaded 'T' word," the report stated. "A 
fractional sales tax, less than one-half of one cent, would provide . . . the 
revenue to construct and sustain a 900-bed facility. Sales taxes have to be 
included in the revenue-planning mix." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury's recommendations found a frustrated audience at the County 
Hall of Administration, where officials have been faced with jail overcrowding 
troubles for the past 10 years. In 1991, local voters rejected a plan, known as 
Measure J, that would have raised the sales tax by half a cent for new jail 
construction in Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Measure J initiative went down in flames," Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder 
said Wednesday. "I implore the citizenry to get involved, because we really 
need their help. When there was a tax increase proposed, the voters didn't like 
that. This kind of thing is matter of shared responsibility. We (the Board of 
Supervisors) can't do it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said possible solutions to the 
overcrowding problem have always been blocked by too little money and not 
necessarily a lack of political will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we had a site to build a jail and state bond money for construction, 
the problem has always been the maintenance and operating costs," Schneider 
said. "That's a big ticket item."  
</P>
<P>
 At the proposed Gypsum Canyon site, officials estimated, a jail would have 
cost at least $100 million a year to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless there is a change of heart among the voters, Schneider said the county 
would continue its current course of adding jail beds to existing facilities as 
money becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has added 1,120 jail beds to existing facilities since 1987 at the 
Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange and at the Intake/Release Center in Santa Ana. 
But the state has provided 75% of the construction costs for those additions 
and expansions, and jurors reported that the state is unlikely to "be such a 
helpful partner today." 
</P>
<P>
 County facilities have a current capacity of 3,821 beds, but the grand jury 
said the county was actually in need of 7,436 beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shortage manifests itself in the literal releasing or turning away 
annually for lack of beds tens of thousands of persons, persons would normally 
spend time in jail," the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors predicted that the state's new "three strikes" law, which provides 
lifetime prison sentences for three-time felons, would only worsen the county's 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, the state prison (system) cannot always absorb inmates as fast as 
the county can process them," jurors said. "The county will be forced to hold 
state-bound inmates longer, tying up precious beds -- as the shortage becomes 
more acute." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plans for additional expansion at Theo Lacy, but the grand jury said 
the county was in need of a long-term plan for its future needs, especially in 
light of the new sentencing mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any long-range planning in place at all," Supervisor William G. 
Steiner said. "What we're seeing is short-term approaches because there is no 
money."

A DOSE OF DISNEYLAND; ILL CHILDREN GET THEIR WISH IN TRIP TO MAGIC KINGDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAIME ABDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six-year-old Ryan Buehler of British Columbia could barely sleep the night 
before his trip to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 While on the plane to Orange County, Ryan studied the map of the Magic 
Kingdom, plotting how he would spend every minute of his seven hours at the 
amusement park. Toon Town, Splash Mountain and Space Mountain were high on his 
list. He didn't want to miss a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other 75 children on the trip, Ryan, who has lymphatic cancer, was a 
guest of the Sunshine Foundation of Canada, a private organization that grants 
wishes to children who have serious illnesses. The children, who range in age 
from 5 to 17, boarded a plane Wednesday morning in Kelowna, Canada, destined 
for John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 When the children -- all of whom have either life-threatening illnesses or 
severe physical disabilities -- landed after their nearly three-hour flight, 
they were greeted by banners welcoming them to California, with a band, a clown 
and about 80 Orange County Sheriff's Department volunteers waving wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 Each child was quickly matched up with a Sheriff's Department volunteer, 
placed on one of seven buses and carted off to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "First stop, Cartoon Spin," said Ryan, who, like the rest of the children, was 
wearing a yellow T-shirt and matching baseball cap with an orange and black 
tiger tail attached. "But I want to see everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The children were selected for the annual day trip by the Sunshine Foundation 
based on their health status. A medical staff from Canada and members of the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police also traveled with the group. 
</P>
<P>
 George Lensen, a spokesman for the foundation, said the $70,000 price tag for 
the trip was paid by Esso Retailers of Okanangan Valley, Canada, through a 
telethon and other fund-raising events. Lensen said a different group of 
children takes the trip each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at Disneyland, the children quickly huddled around the different Disney 
characters who were stationed at the front of the park. Goofy, Pluto and, of 
course, Mickey Mouse were there to hug the children, pose for pictures and sign 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hug from Mickey, Ryan told his small group of Sheriff's Department 
buddies, "Now let's go on the rides." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Allemand, a volunteer who helped her husband escort Ryan and another 
child, Ryan Gorr, on a slew of rides, said she couldn't think of a better way 
to spend a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be the last thing some of these kids do," she said. "And I want to 
be a part of it. It must be such a rush for them." 
</P>
<P>
 After squeaking past the crowds on Main Street, most headed straight for Toon 
Town, where the children could see the homes of Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Goofy 
and Chip and Dale. But others headed straight for the roller coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Megan Atkinson-Smith, a 10-year-old who is blind and diabetic, had plans to 
ride every roller coaster ride in the amusement park. Within the first hour of 
her visit, she rode both Space Mountain and the Matterhorn Bobsled. And once 
off the Matterhorn, Megan wanted to go again. 
</P>
<P>
 Her medical assistant, Jo Ann Dueck, said those rides were just the beginning 
of their day. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's fine," Dueck said. "I'm the one who's getting sick." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fun wasn't only for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Sheriff Dennis W. LaDucer said his office has been working with the 
foundation for the past three years, and each year he has an overflow of 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a week of posting the notice (for volunteers), we had more than 
enough," LaDucer said. "And it's a great for the deputies because it shows them 
the other side of life . . . a good side. And these kids are like any other 
kids, just braver."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; KINDNESS PUTS KIDS IN PRINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lisa Hoang learned that small kindnesses come back in unexpected ways after 
she threw a surprise party for a friend last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend's parents were too busy moving to celebrate her birthday and Lisa, 
a fifth-grader at Irvine's Greentree Elementary School, felt sorry for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was so happy she cried," Lisa wrote in an essay about the incident. She 
had no way of knowing that her act of kindness would lead her to become a 
published author. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa was one of 12 students from the Greentree school whose essays were chosen 
for a book titled "Kids' Random Acts of Kindness," released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The book was modeled on the adult best seller "Random Acts of Kindness." The 
children's version, already set for a second printing, is a collection of short 
essays by 58 children around the country, including the dozen from Greentree. 
</P>
<P>
 At a book-signing at the school on Wednesday, 12-year-old author Alexander 
Jackson said, "My mom didn't realize how big this was. She thought it was some 
little paperback that you would find in a thrift shop."  
</P>
<P>
 The book, published by Berkeley's Conari Press, is a glossy 122 pages with a 
forward by former First Lady Rosalynn Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's essay recalls the time he went into a bakery and ordered something 
because the firm seemed to be suffering from a lack of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, a newly arrived Norwegian couple, "gave me a big piece of the best 
chocolate cake, then they showed me around," he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 Greentree Principal Dianne Daugherty had distributed "Random Acts of Kindness" 
to her teachers in December, who then asked the students to write about 
something kind that they or someone else had done that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found it was really self-perpetuating," said fifth-grade teacher Karen 
Miles. "They tend to think that acts of kindness are grand gestures, and they 
didn't realize they do so many small things during the day and it makes such a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The students also are pleased with themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Yau, 9, announced proudly that he now commits a random act of kindness 
"almost every day."  
</P>
<P>
 Justin Courtright, a 10-year-old at Greentree, told of being in a toy store 
looking for a special toy when he noticed another child looking for the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom saw one and got it down from the top shelf," he wrote. "And then I went 
to the boy and gave it to the boy." 
</P>
<P>
 And Aaron Greeley, 11, helped his mother out when she arrived at a movie 
theater and realized she did not have enough money to buy tickets for Aaron and 
his cousins.  
</P>
<P>
 "I luckely (sic) I had twenty dollar bill in my pocket and I paid for my 
cousin and I," he wrote. "It cost me $9.45 but it was nothing." LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; WOMAN, 35, KILLED IN AUTO ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 35-year-old woman was killed late Tuesday when her car collided with a 
pickup truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at Trabuco Road and Yale Avenue about 10:45 p.m., police 
Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu-saw Hsia of Irvine was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where 
she died. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the pickup, a 26-year-old Marine stationed at the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station, was not injured, but a passenger in the truck sustained 
minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Hsia's car was traveling west on Trabuco and the pickup was 
heading south on Yale when the collision occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone ran a red light," Allevato said. However, investigators have not 
determined which driver ran the red light.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI PROFESSOR JOINS PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY

<TEXT>
<P>
 A UC Irvine professor has been elected to the American Philosophical Society, 
the oldest American academy recognizing achievement in thought, UCI officials 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 R. Duncan Luce, a psychologist and distinguished professor of cognitive 
sciences at UCI, was among 30 people from the United States and six from abroad 
elected to the society April 22, UCI spokesman Scott Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other figures elected included Walter Cronkite, Toni Morrison and Nelson 
Mandela, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luce, of Irvine, uses mathematics to try to predict human behavior, Nelson 
said. Luce's models of behavior are often used by researchers worldwide, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCI, the professor directs the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral 
Sciences, which includes more than 35 faculty members who examine how 
mathematics relates to sciences such as psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Luce, 69, came to UCI in 1988 after serving as a professor at Harvard 
University, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Philosophical Society was founded in 1743, Nelson said. The group 
recognizes achievement in science, humanities and arts, provides grants, and 
publishes journals. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other UCI researcher -- Francisco Ayala, a distinguished professor of 
biological sciences, has been elected to the prestigious society, Nelson said. 
Ayala was chosen in 1984. ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; SEVENTH-GRADER WITH KNIFE IS EXPELLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fullerton School District Board of Trustees this week expelled a 
seventh-grade student from Nicolas Junior High School for carrying a knife on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The student is the ninth to be expelled for toting a weapon at school this 
school year, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 School Board President Robert C. Fisler said he hopes the latest expulsion 
will send a strong message to students that "we won't tolerate" the bringing of 
knives or other weapons to school. 
</P>
<P>
 In this expulsion case, a parent called the junior high school last month, 
complaining that her child had been threatened by the knife-carrying 
seventh-grade boy. An administrator subsequently searched the student and found 
a knife in his pants pocket, Fisler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child denied making any threats but admitted he had been carrying a knife 
to school for two weeks," Fisler said. 
</P>
<P>
 By expelling the student, "we're protecting the rest of the schoolchildren," 
he said. Fisler, who has served on the school board for 17 years, said he is 
"rather shocked" at the recent increase in weapons on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on the board a long time, and we've seen none of that until about 
two years ago," he said. "We've been very fortunate, however, because we 
haven't had any serious problems arise, and we don't want any." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; HARBOR TAXI SERVICE SETS SAIL SATURDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Penny and Ralph Rodheim want you to know that a taxicab isn't just a vehicle 
confined to land. This weekend they will start up a "Harbor Hopper" boat 
service to ferry passengers throughout Newport Harbor, stopping at Balboa 
Island, various restaurants along Mariners Mile, and along the Lido Peninsula 
and Lido Isle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think that it's something needed," Penny Rodheim said. "We don't 
often take advantage of so many things to do right here in the harbor. It makes 
everything more accessible." 
</P>
<P>
 Their water taxi is set to begin operating Saturday, departing from Balboa 
Boat Rentals on the Balboa Peninsula every hour and a half from noon until 
midnight. The boat will operate from noon until 9 p.m. on Sundays, noon until 6 
p.m. on Mondays, and 6 p.m. to midnight on Thursdays and Fridays. The boat 
carries 24 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodheims said they hope their $12 all-day trips and $6 one-hour excursions 
will bring more business to local restaurants. Local restaurateurs welcomed the 
news, but said people have tried the same taxi idea in the past without notable 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, cars are ferried from the peninsula to Balboa Island. The Harbor 
Hopper will take only people, and will cruise the shoreline as well as the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodheims said they will try out the Harbor Hopper through the summer, and 
will continue the service if it is successful. LYNN FRANEY

<P>
 Eleven schools in the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District will have 
new principals this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are part of the district's plan to rotate principals every five 
years, a policy adopted to allow school administrators to work at a variety of 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials also announced that they would conduct a job search for 
three principals to replace El Dorado High School Principal JoAnn Ball and Rose 
Drive Elementary School Principal Audell Jackson, who are retiring at the end 
of this school year, and Yorba Linda Middle School Principal Ken Lorge, who 
will become the district's administrator of child welfare and attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The new principal assignments include Joe Quartucci, El Dorado High School; 
George Allen, Valencia High School; Richard Vouga, Yorba Linda Middle School; 
Randi Trontz, Morse Avenue Elementary School; Paula Emry-Burtt, Brookhaven 
Elementary School; Phil Hergenreder, Rose Drive Elementary School; Kathy 
Pritchard, Topaz Elementary School; and Kjell Taylor, Rio Vista Elementary 
School. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GOP ADMONISHES ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Republican Party on Wednesday admonished 70th Assembly 
District candidate Marilyn C. Brewer for claiming in a campaign mailer that she 
is the "only candidate in this race who has pledged not to accept" a recent 
legislative pay raise if she wins the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewer campaign, however, stood by its statement and dismissed the 
"admonishment" -- the least punitive finding that could be issued under the 
party's rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint was brought against Brewer by a rival candidate, Thomas G. 
Reinecke, who vowed to donate the recently approved 35% pay raise to charity if 
he is elected to the Assembly seat being vacated by Gil Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay of state legislators -- which has become a hot issue in some local 
races -- will increase in December from $52,500 to $72,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke said he thought Brewer's statement was "malicious . . . and it's 
misrepresenting the facts to the voters. And I think the voters should be 
informed to the true facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke said his campaign does not "do any negative campaigning, nor will 
we." 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign recently sent out a letter pointing out the financial 
difficulties of the third candidate in the race, Irvine Councilman Barry J. 
Hammond. But Reinecke claimed it "was basically a factual piece. But what 
(Brewer) is doing is manufacturing facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer responded: "Reinecke is accepting the pay raise. That's the only thing 
we are claiming." 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign consultant, Harvey Englander, said he argued to the ethics 
committee that "there is a world of difference" between refusing a raise and 
therefore not taking control over the funds, and donating the raise to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Englander said the campaign checked with state officials and determined that a 
legislator can reject the pay raise outright. Anyone who receives the raise and 
then donates it can claim the donation as a tax deduction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that a legislator can also go back on his promise, as did one 
Reinecke backer, Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), who donated a pay raise 
for only his first year in office. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement issued by ethics committee chairman Chuck DeVore, the 
GOP panel said it was "unmoved by this legalistic argument and finds that the 
statement in the Brewer mailer would have misled a reasonable person as to . . 
. Reinecke's stated position on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, the third candidate in the race, has not stated whether he would 
accept or reject the pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, Reinecke apologized for an error in a letter sent to some 
district voters under his father's signature, which claimed that state Sen. 
Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) had endorsed the younger Reinecke. Bergeson, 
who has remained neutral in the race, sent a letter to Reinecke late last week 
demanding that he discontinue distributing the false claim of her 
endorsement.GEBE MARTINEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; PANEL PLAN OKD FOR SCHOOL EXPULSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school district board gave preliminary approval last week to form an 
administrative panel of principals to handle expulsion hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, trustees hear expulsions, but some believe the task would be better 
handled by educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Trustees President Robert Sedlak supported forming a panel because "I 
don't feel all our experience equals the experience of principals" in dealing 
with students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really important to let staff do the job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of three principals would act on the board's behalf during expulsion 
hearings and report recommendation for expulsions to trustees, said Fern Zahlen 
Williams, director of student services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board of trustees still has the final say on who is expelled," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are expected to take final action this month on the administrative 
hearing panel proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Barbara Vogel and Catherine Hacker also voted in favor of the panel. 
Vogel suggested that a trustee be appointed to observe expulsion hearings in 
order to report back to other board members. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials will look into whether it would be legal to appoint a board 
liaison before trustees take final action. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Larry Crandall and Julie Hoxsie voted against the proposal. Hoxsie 
said the responsibility to hear expulsions rests with trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall said he believes it is not in the best interests of the district to 
set up a panel. 
</P>
<P>
 He said trustees should wait until a revised board policy on zero-tolerance 
concerning children taking weapons to school becomes effective, and determine 
what effect the changes will have on the number of expulsions, before handing 
over the hearings to principals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more appropriate to let the new policy take effect," Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees gave final approval on the changes to the zero-tolerance policy 
on Thursday. The changes were made to give principals a clearer interpretation 
of when to recommend students for expulsions for taking a weapon onto campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Among changes were eliminating the wording of "any knife" in the policy and 
changing it to "a weapon," since it seemed confusing which types and sizes of 
knives would be an expellable offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policy, however, if a child takes a weapon to school, the student 
will face expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, if two or more students involved in the same incident are 
expelled, they would be placed at separate campuses "if at all possible." 
</P>
<P>
 This school year alone, 21 students in both regular and special education have 
committed expellable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight students have been expelled and assigned to alternative school placement 
outside the district; five students were expelled but were sent to another 
school in the district; and one student who came before a hearing was not 
expelled, said Supt. Ruben L. Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining students were special-education students, he said. These 
students could not be brought to a hearing because federal law prohibits 
conducting expulsion proceedings when the handicapping condition is determined 
to be related to the offense committed, Ingram said.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; LLOREDA, 2 OTHERS LEAD IN FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the City Council election less than a week away, Bill Shepherd, Harold R. 
Kaufman and incumbent Karen Lloreda lead all 12 candidates in raising campaign 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherd, Kaufman and Lloreda raised $9,452, $9,010 and $8,322, respectively, 
as of last Friday, which was the latest deadline for filing campaign 
contribution reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the five council seats are up for grabs in the race Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the race is heated, fund raising is below that of other council 
campaigns in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest financial statements also show the emergence of a new political 
action committee, a group called "Concerned Taxpayers of Dana Point including 
the M.H. Sherman Company & Chandis Securities Co."  
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. and Pasadena-based Chandis Securities Co. 
are the owners of the 121-acre Dana Point Headlands peninsula, where a 
controversial $500-million development plan for a resort hotel and homes has 
emerged as the leading issue in the council election. 
</P>
<P>
 (Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the 
Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times Mirror Co., which publishes 
the Los Angeles Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Concerned Taxpayers group was formed to help elect Shepherd, Kaufman and 
Lloreda, according to papers filed with the city clerk. The group has $8,000 in 
its treasury and has so far spent more than $6,000 on mailers for the three 
candidates, who support the Headlands development. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local political observers consider the fund-raising totals low for a 
council race in Dana Point. For example, in the 1990 race, council members Mike 
Eggers and Eileen Krause each raised about $25,000 for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggers, a six-year council member who will step down next month, said the low 
fund raising reflects the poor economy and the candidates' inability to raise 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some candidates are just very poor fund-raisers," said Eggers, an aide to 
Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside). "They don't know how to ask for a donation. The 
other thing is they are not motivating their supporters enough to write a 
check." 
</P>
<P>
 After the three front-runners, the leading fund-raisers include Witold (Wit) 
Muller, $5,443; Ernest A. Nelson, $4,631, and Addison H. DeBoi, $4,073, 
according to the clerk's records. 
</P>
<P>
 The next financial filing deadline is July 31, but if any person or committee 
makes an expenditure for a candidate of $1,000 or more between now and the 
election, it must be reported within 24 hours, City Clerk Sharon L. Waits said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STANTON MAN HELD IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's authorities have arrested a 44-year-old Stanton man on suspicion of 
molesting two teen-age boys he befriended while running a baseball card shop 
near Magnolia High School in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators arrested Luis Daniel Garcia on Friday on suspicion of child 
molestation and sexual exploitation of a child, Lt. Dan Martini reported 
Wednesday.The suspect is being held at Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said investigators believe there could be other victims, and ask 
anyone with information to call the Sheriff's Department Sex Crimes Unit at 
(714) 647-7479. Garcia, who has lived in Orange County for 20 years, may have 
been a coach in local baseball leagues, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged molestation of the two boys, identified only as ages 14 and 15, 
occurred in Stanton and Westminster from 1992 to the present, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 After befriending the boys at the baseball card shop, Martini said Garcia 
allegedly invited them to his Stanton apartment to view sexually explicit 
videos and magazines. The suspect allegedly molested the boys and recorded some 
of the acts on video without their knowledge, Martini said.ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; COUPONS SOFTEN COST OF BICYCLE HELMETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, traffic officer Karl Mansfield was thrown off his motorcycle as he 
struck the rear bumper of a pickup he was chasing for a traffic violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like being hit by Lyle Alzado on the football field," Mansfield said. 
"I hit the asphalt pretty hard. There was ringing in my ears. I tried to get 
up, but I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to the helmet he was wearing, Mansfield, 30, escaped serious 
injuries when he was thrown 20 feet. The incident has made him an advocate of 
helmets for young bicycle riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cheap insurance," he said. "But you cannot put a price tag on your 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Mansfield has started a program in the Police Department that will make it 
easier for children and their parents to buy a cycling helmet. With the help of 
a bike-shop owner, the police will distribute half-price coupons for kids' 
helmets.  
</P>
<P>
 The program began Wednesday as Mansfield announced that 17,000 flyers on bike 
safety, with a coupon attached to each, will be distributed today to Garden 
Grove students from third grade to high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The coupons may be redeemed at Dave's Schwinn at 2717 W. Lincoln Ave. in 
Anaheim, Ocean Schwinn at 19730 Beach Blvd. in Huntington Beach and Dave's 
Bicycle Plus at 540 E. 1st St. in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about profits, this is about safety," said Dave Coombs, 48, a 
former Garden Grove resident who owns the three bike shops. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law went into effect in January requiring children under 18 riding 
bicycles to wear a helmet. This year they get only a warning, but next year 
they can be fined, Mansfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to give children tickets," Mansfield said. "We'd rather have 
them wearing helmets." 
</P>
<P>
 A top-quality bike helmet can cost $40 or more, and Mansfield has heard many 
parents complain about price. The coupon program is an answer to that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents look at it as an expense," said John Palmer, regional sales manager 
of Schwinn Cycling & Fitness Inc., which has joined the program. "But it's to 
protect their children. It takes a small fall to cause serious head injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Coombs, who has been selling bicycles for 16 years, said it's important to 
emphasize safety and minimize risk in cycling. He also emphasized that helmets 
must fit properly and meet safety requirements.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ACTIVIST GROUP ASKS JUDGE TO STEP DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first political statement, Orange County's newly formed chapter of the 
Mexican American Political Assn. has passed a resolution condemning Santa Ana 
Municipal Judge Claude E. Whitney and calling on him to withdraw his candidacy 
for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 State judicial authorities filed misconduct charges last month against 
Whitney, who has been accused of denying hundreds of indigent defendants their 
constitutional rights, including access to defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking him to resign, to give up his seat, to give someone who has a 
heart in the right place an opportunity," said Rueben Martinez, president of 
the local MAPA chapter. "The election is next week and we're going to be faced 
with this guy and his decisions for another six years. We have to get him out 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney referred all calls on the misconduct allegations to his attorney, who 
said the judge would not step out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not," attorney Ronald G. Brower said. 
</P>
<P>
 The local chapter of MAPA was formed in March to combat immigrant-bashing and 
encourage Latinos to participate in the political process. The group's 
resolution is based on a 325-page complaint against Whitney by the Orange 
County public defender's office, findings of the Orange County Bar Assn. Due 
Process Task Force, and the recent Commission on Judicial Performance decision 
to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution alleges that Whitney punished defendants who requested a lawyer 
by sending them to jail for a minimum of seven days, "thus virtually coercing a 
guilty plea from them." The judge also has been accused of prohibiting public 
defenders from talking to their clients in court, imposing illegal sentences, 
denying bail hearings to defendants and failing to provide court interpreters 
for non-English speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a burden and will continue to be a burden to our people with his 
daily decisions," Martinez said. "That's one of the reasons why this 
organization was formed, to stand up and defend the rights of people under 
these circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Brower said the allegations are unfounded. He said the Orange County Bar Assn. 
published its resolution condemning Whitney without conducting hearings or 
getting the judge's side of the story, and that the public defender's office 
also did not conduct hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brower said the state Commission on Judicial Performance reviewed 39 
allegations against the judge but filed only three formal charges. Those 
pending charges allege improper sentencing, mistreatment of defense counsel and 
failures to advise defendants of their constitutional rights.  
</P>
<P>
 The Commission on Judicial Performance initiated formal disciplinary 
proceedings last month after 1 1/2 years of investigation. But Brower said none 
of the allegations involve racial discrimination. LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FEVER DRUG MAY BE DEADLY, DOCTOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County public health officials are warning parents not to use a 
fever-suppressing drug sold in Mexico that may have contributed to the deaths 
of two Orange County toddlers in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hilde Meyers, a county epidemiologist, said the drug -- known in Spanish 
as "neo-melubrina" -- was banned in the United States in 1967 because it can 
cause a dangerous drop in white blood cells, which fight infections.Adverse 
reactions to the drug seem unrelated to the dosage or how long it is taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Antonio Arrieta, an infectious disease specialist at Children's Hospital 
of Orange County in Orange, said the 2-year-olds -- a boy and a girl -- who 
died after taking the drug had Mexican parents who likely obtained the drug in 
Mexico. He said the boy, who was admitted to CHOC last July, was treated for a 
severe drop in white blood cells. It was only after the boy died, Arrieta said, 
that he learned his parents had given him neo-melubrina. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, Arrieta said, was admitted April 3 to the CHOC/St. Joseph Hospital 
emergency room and sent home because she seemed well. But later in the day she 
took a turn for the worse and died at Coastal Communities Hospital in Santa 
Ana, a CHOC spokesperson said. CHOC's staff reviewed the girl's chart and 
discovered she too had been given neo-melubrina. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I want to communicate to the Orange County population, especially those 
who visit Mexico, is not to give medications that are sold in Mexico," Arrieta 
said. "It may be others (who have taken neo-melubrina) have died in other 
hospitals for unexplained reasons." Neo-melubrina is sold over the counter in 
Latin American countries, where it is as common a medication as aspirin or 
Tylenol, he said.

JURY VIEWS PHOTOS OF RAT INJURIES ON BOY; COURTS: THE GRUESOME EVIDENCE IS 
INTRODUCED ON SECOND DAY OF THE TRIAL OF THE VICTIM'S PARENTS, STEVEN AND 
KATHYLEEN GIGUERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The mother of a 4-month-old baby who was bitten more than 100 times by a 
starving pet rat wept in court Wednesday as a jury viewed graphic photos of the 
boy's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathyleen Giguere, 31, dabbed at her eyes with tissue and her husband and 
co-defendant, Steven Giguere Sr., hung his head as enlarged photos were 
introduced during the second day of the couple's trial on involuntary 
manslaughter and child endangerment charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kathleen Trivich, the physician who was on duty at Western Medical 
Center-Anaheim, told the Superior Court jury that Steven Giguere Jr. had been 
dead about two hours when emergency workers brought him there about 3:30 a.m. 
on Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no signs of life whatsoever," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Tanizaki had warned the jurors in advance that evidence 
in the trial would be gruesome, and some jurors shook their heads and looked 
away as the photos were posted in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gigueres were homeless and living in a filthy, trash-strewn station wagon 
with their son and 3-year-old daughter, Karissa, when their pet rat, Homer, 
turned on the infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the couple were criminally negligent by allowing the rat -- 
which had a history of biting people -- to roam free. The couple were not 
around when the rat's sharp teeth struck an artery, causing the child to bleed 
to death, Tanizaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys told jurors during the trial's opening statements that 
the child was already dead, possibly due to sudden infant death syndrome or a 
congenital breathing disorder, when the attack began. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple face up to six years in prison if convicted. Karissa is now in the 
care of her grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Giguere Sr. called 911 about 3 a.m. on Aug. 26 to report that the baby 
had stopped breathing, according to the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 In other testimony Wednesday, Anaheim patrol officer Richard Christensen told 
jurors Steven Giguere Sr., 28, was asleep in the back seat when he arrived at 
the crime scene about 6 a.m. and found blood-soaked clothes in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Animal Control Officer Brett Berg testified that Homer also bit him -- 
drawing blood -- when he reached under the front seat to capture the rat.  
</P>
<P>
 "The rat came up and bit me on the finger," he said, adding that he later 
caught Homer and killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 A necropsy on the rat showed he was starving and dehydrated.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS ASSAIL STATE POLICY ON GNATCATCHER; WILDLIFE: COURT FILING BY 
FISH AND GAME DIRECTOR CALLED 'DOUBLE TALK' TO THWART PROTECTION. AGENCY SAYS 
IT'S NEUTRAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalists are charging the state with abusing its power in supporting 
a local plan that could keep the California gnatcatcher off the federal 
threatened species list. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reprehensible violation of their mission to protect wildlife," Dan 
Silver, coordinator of a Los Angeles-based group called the Endangered Habitats 
League, said Wednesday of the state's position. "I think it's double talk." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy was sparked by a court declaration submitted this week by Boyd 
Gibbons, director of the California Department of Fish and Game. In it, Gibbons 
outlined an extensive habitat conservation program being developed in 
California called the Natural Communities Conservation Plan under which 
developers voluntarily preserve crucial habitat in exchange for permission to 
develop on land considered less essential to various species including the 
gnatcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "This approach ultimately may forestall the need for additional species to be 
listed under the Endangered Species Act," the director wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement was submitted to the U.S. District Court in Washington on 
Tuesday along with other documentation provided by the building industry aimed 
at persuading Judge Stanley Sporkin to keep the bird off the threatened species 
list. Sporkin ordered the gnatcatcher removed from the list last month, saying 
that the federal government had failed to make available to the public all of 
the raw data it relied upon when it declared the songbird threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision was immediately challenged by Secretary of the Interior 
Bruce Babbitt, who promised to provide evidence that the bird needs federal 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the matter is set for Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons was out of town and unavailable for comment on Wednesday. But Craig 
Manson, a lawyer representing the department, said Gibbons' court declaration 
was not intended to take a position on the litigation in question. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've done," Manson said, "is provided a statement to the court which is 
purely factual and neutral on the main issue" of re-listing. "It is designed to 
assist the court in understanding what is going on on the ground in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement was submitted by lawyers representing the Building Industry 
Assn. of Southern California, the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor 
Agency and the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Manson acknowledged that the effect could well be a bolstering of the building 
industry's argument against listing the small songbird as a threatened species. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no secret that our original desire with the program was to avoid listing 
the gnatcatcher," he said. "The program was originally conceived -- and still 
has the aim -- of getting away from species-by-species listings" in favor of a 
broader site-oriented approach to species protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver, however, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is trying to remove protection," he said.

DISTRICT OUT OF DANGER OF LOSING STATE 'SPACE-SAVER' SCHOOL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District is no longer in danger of losing $23 
million in state funding that had been set aside for a controversial school 
slated to be built at a shopping center here, a state official has said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state set the money aside based on a preliminary appraisal of the Bristol 
Marketplace site by the school district.The district hopes to acquire state 
funds to build the "space-saver" school under legislation intended to provide 
schools in crowded urban areas without condemning homes or businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The site has been attacked because the preliminary appraisal was steep and 
included the cost to tear down and rebuild two businesses at the shopping 
center, at 17th and Bristol streets.  
</P>
<P>
 The State Allocation Board, which doles out money for school construction, 
planned to consider pulling the funding at its June meeting because the 
district missed a May 1 deadline to turn in a state-funded appraisal.  
</P>
<P>
 But Lyle Smoot, assistant executive officer of the State Allocation Board, 
said the district has turned in the appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect it will be on the July meeting agenda, to approve the final 
acquisition of the property," Smoot said. "I feel much more confident about the 
project now. From my discussions with other members of the State Allocation 
Board, I think they're getting closer to a meeting of the minds."

WALK-ON HATTRUP WALKS OFF; BASKETBALL: COACH OF DOMINATING BREA-OLINDA GIRLS' 
BASKETBALL TEAM SHOCKS ADMINISTRATORS, COACHES WITH DECISION TO RESIGN AFTER 
JUST ONE SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Hattrup, who coached the Brea-Olinda girls' basketball team to an 
unbeaten season, the State title and a No. 1 national ranking, has resigned 
after only one year on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 A walk-on coach whose trademark was intense preparation, Hattrup, who resigned 
Tuesday, said Wednesday he was looking for a job with more permanence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hattrup, 35, taught two physical education classes at Brea, a physical 
education class at Brea Junior High, and was a substitute the other three class 
periods. He will no longer teach those classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've done everything there that I can do," he said. "I've been there 
seven years and I've been coaching for 17. I think it's time to move on and do 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibilities include coaching either men or women at the collegiate 
level, or return to high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to coach unless I have a full-time job, and it's going to have 
to be in physical education, and that's a hard match," Hattrup said. "There's 
more to life than teaching and coaching. If something doesn't work out in that 
area, I'll find something else to do. It's not the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 During his seven years at Brea, the team won six Southern Section 
championships and five State titles. He was quickly named to succeed Mark Trakh 
last year when Trakh became head coach at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little surprising, but his resignation stated that he's looking for 
a full-time teaching job," Brea Principal John Johnson said. "I think he must 
have a pretty good feel for maybe an assistant or head college coaching 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he feels this is best for him, I certainly can understand that. He was 
coach of a national championship team. There's a chance he's taking advantage 
of that. There's no place else for him to go in the high school ranks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hattrup coached 10 years at Mission Viejo High -- beginning while he was a 
sophomore at Saddleback College -- and produced a 215-55 record, including two 
section titles and a State championship game appearance in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 In his only year as Brea's head coach, Hattrup directed the Ladycats to a 33-0 
record and the State Division III title. They were ranked No. 1 in USA Today's 
national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Trakh) said last year that he had done everything, you know, 'What else is 
there to do?,' " Hattrup said. "The only thing left was to win a national 
championship. And now that's been done. I think it's a good time to move on and 
let someone else create their own program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've coached 17 straight years -- maybe it's time to take a step back. To go 
out with a national championship is a good way to end things. I'm happy with 
what I did there. I think it's time to move on to other things. Get someone in 
there and start a new era because one era is basically coming to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be the Nicole Erickson era. The senior point guard led the Ladycats 
to a 130-5 record and four State titles during her four years as a starter. 
Brea has won the State title a record five times in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement caught other coaches off guard, even ones who had close 
working relationships with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stunned, shocked, surprised -- take your choice," Newport Harbor 
assistant Jack Jakosky said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado Coach Gary Raya was equally surprised after speaking with Hattrup: 
"I couldn't believe it when he said, 'It's true.' He must have felt really 
strongly to walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 Hattrup informed players Tuesday afternoon. He said he began considering the 
decision "two or three weeks" ago and that it was his alone to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any pressure from anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never done anything else (besides coach), so it's hard to evaluate if 
I'm missing anything, but you do have to evaluate how much time you put into 
something and if it's really worth it. Last year, we didn't leave any rock 
unturned -- you can't when you're playing at this level. Everybody at times 
needs to step back and look at what's going on. Right now, my future is up for 
grabs."

WORLD CUP '94: 15 DAYS AND COUNTING; CLE IS KEY FOR U.S.; DEFENDER KOOIMAN 
PLAYS LIKE WILD MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do people call Cle Kooiman? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it depends upon the country or club he is representing. Or whether you 
are a teammate or an opponent who has landed face first after a meeting with 
Kooiman's elbow or some other body part. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us count the names, starting with the right ones. His first name is the 
French word for key . His last name is pure Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
 In English, he says he doesn't mind "Wild Man," presumably meant as a 
complimentary description. His first name is pronounced like the word clay . 
But teammates call him, among other things, "the Wall," "Tarzan" and "Cujo," 
the rabid St. Bernard in the movie of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, a curious mental picture is starting to form. 
</P>
<P>
 A man of the World Cup, Kooiman's path to the U.S. national soccer team was 
almost circular, starting in Ontario, his hometown, and continuing to the L.A. 
Aztecs of the North American Soccer League, to the indoor L.A. Lazers at the 
Forum in Inglewood, to Tijuana, to Juarez, to Mexico City, and finally to 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Mexico where his image grew and spawned some new descriptive terms, 
attempts to sum up his hell-bent, win-at-all-costs philosophy as a gritty, 
physical defender with average skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The rival coaches and newspapers in Mexico said Kooiman was like mala leche . 
Translation: Bad milk. 
</P>
<P>
 Kooiman pleads not guilty. The only bad milk he knows is the kind he might 
mistakenly pour from a container left unrefrigerated too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have mala leche, you go in to try and hurt somebody," he said. 
"That's not how I am. If I have the chance to win the ball, I'm going to win 
the ball and do anything I can to get in hard." 
</P>
<P>
 At different times during his four years in the Mexican first division -- two 
seasons with the Juarez Cobras and two with Cruz Azul -- Kooiman felt 
surrounded by the mala leche tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time where I was getting eaten up by the papers down there," he 
said. "If they pick up on something, man, you'll have 20 papers all saying the 
same things about you." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Kooiman had a small meeting with the soccer literati and threw down a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'If you can get any play in the game where I come in and try to 
hurt a player, I'll eat my words and say I'm a bad player or a player that's a 
dirty player,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know I'm not a dirty player." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Kooiman doesn't mind and even prefers attempts to compare him to 
the Kings' Marty McSorley, or any of the New York Knicks for that matter. A 
nasty 6-foot-1, 190-pound enforcer on the back line. Those are the kinds of 
descriptions Kooiman wants his friends from Mexico to read before the U.S. 
national team's final tuneup Saturday against Mexico at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a compliment," he said. "I'll do pretty much anything I can do to win -- 
aside from cheating. I like to come in hard on tackles. I like to intimidate 
the players I'm playing against." 
</P>
<P>
 Kooiman's attitude is a rare commodity and something the often shaky U.S. 
defense needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're kind of in a war back there," midfielder Claudio Reyna said. "You 
want big old guys back there killing people. Sometimes you have to be brutal." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bora Milutinovic said: "It is very important for a player to have a 
personality, a great personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic, a big personality himself, embraces spirited players like 
Kooiman. And Kooiman, who turns 31 on July 4, knew he would have a better 
chance to make the team under Milutinovic, who had coached in Mexico, than he 
had under Bob Gansler, the U.S. coach in the 1990 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bora has got to be one of the biggest persons down in Mexico," Kooiman said. 
"I figured it was going to be my opportunity, whether it was last year or the 
following year. I knew inside I'd get some type of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes Mexican soccer. He likes Latino soccer. He has his contacts down 
there and I knew if I had done well there he'd give me a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my goal and that's what happened, even though it was a little bit 
later than I would have liked." 
</P>
<P>
 What he doesn't do is score very often, but that isn't his role. He has scored 
only once in 10 international appearances with the U.S. national team, but it 
was a dramatic goal against Costa Rica in the Gold Cup semifinals in Dallas 
last summer. It gave the United States a 1-0 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, injuries have slowed Kooiman. Last month, it was a minor groin pull. 
More recently, a sore right knee has hampered him, which means the national 
team will probably keep an extra defender on hand for insurance. However, he is 
expected to play against Mexico on Saturday. Kooiman played the first 12 games 
for Cruz Azul this season before needing minor surgery to remove torn knee 
cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz Azul, eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Mexican playoffs in April, 
is one of the more prosperous teams in Mexico. Kooiman earns about $200,000 a 
season, with additional amounts for living expenses and playing bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kooiman's soccer career certainly has not been typical. Once he seemed mired 
at the lower levels with the NASL's Aztecs and the Lazers, nearly turning to a 
new career, kicking in the NFL. At Ontario's Chaffey High, Kooiman set the 
state record when he kicked a 59-yard field goal. At times, even coaching 
seemed an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, though, got him back to the United States. He went from playing before 
sparse crowds to performing in stadiums before as many as 100,000 in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 It very nearly got him to Italy in time for the 1990 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty upset about the whole situation," Kooiman said. "I never even 
got a game. I figured if they had given me a game, at least I could look myself 
in the mirror and say, 'Oh God, I gave it my old college try and just wasn't 
good enough.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I could go home and sleep well. But it wasn't like that.' 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, the man known as Cujo -- and many other names -- can finally 
sleep well at night.

JIM MURRAY: HOLD YOUR HORSEPOWER, DON'T BLAME THE WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the aftermaths of the 78th Indianapolis 500 is something I find 
distressing and can only refer to as "Roger bashing." 
</P>
<P>
 It goes like this: Break up Roger Penske or his team. Hogtie him with rules. 
Make him tee it up next year in a stock '54 DeSoto. Ban him. Exile him. Get a 
restraining order against his getting within 25 miles of Indianapolis in May. 
Hold him in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 What did he do? He won his 10th Indy 500 in 26 years and his third in the last 
four. He got the best drivers in the world and put them in the best cars.  
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute! Isn't that what you're supposed to do? I thought that was the 
whole idea of the race. I thought that was the whole idea of sport. 
</P>
<P>
 So, why should we send Penske to Elba?  
</P>
<P>
 They say he has an unfair advantage. Well, what?  
</P>
<P>
 Well, he hooked up with Mercedes-Benz and Ilmor Engineering and produced an 
engine that was clearly faster than the competition. Well, so he did. So he has 
always done. So what? 
</P>
<P>
 He did that as far back as 1972 with a four-cylinder Offenhauser engine. He 
did that several times subsequently with Cosworth Fords. Then he did it with 
V-8 Chevies. Now, he does it with Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, in the news conferences after the race you would have thought he had 
performed grand larceny. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about Michael Andretti saying your cars had 200 more horsepower in the 
straights?" he was asked accusingly in tones usually reserved for kidnaping 
suspects. An "All right, Joe, what did you do with the baby?" tone of voice.  
</P>
<P>
 So? Whose fault is it he had more horsepower? Well, they said resentfully, he 
took advantage of a loophole in the rules.  
</P>
<P>
 Hey! Why didn't those other guys? Penske didn't write the rules. He simply 
read them. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he had the might of Mercedes behind him. Well, OK. But, if it was that 
easy, why didn't Rolls-Royce do it? Honda did try it. It not only couldn't get 
a car on the pole or in Victory Lane, it couldn't get one in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me tell you something about Roger Penske: In the preparation for the Gulf 
War three years ago, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf consulted him on vehicular 
problems for Operation Desert Storm. Does that tell you something about him?  
</P>
<P>
 Many years ago when Ben Hogan was dominating the game of golf, a rival, Mike 
Souchak, once observed ruefully, "Ben Hogan just knows something about hitting 
a golf ball the rest of us don't know." Same with Roger Penske and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider his record. If you check the accomplishments of a lot of guys in 
Penske's position -- which essentially is that of coach or manager -- you find 
that they had the advantage of a field leader. You will note the former 
Pittsburgh Steeler coach, Chuck Noll, got to four Super Bowls -- all with the 
same quarterback, Terry Bradshaw. Tom Landry was most successful when he had 
Roger Staubach, Bill Walsh with Joe Montana. John McGraw was a great manager -- 
when he had Christy Mathewson. Miller Huggins had Ruth and Gehrig.  
</P>
<P>
 When the constant is the coach, you know you are dealing with genius. When 
Roger Penske first went to the Speedway, he had Mark Donohue, a sports car 
driver. On their fourth try, they won. Penske later hooked up with Rick Mears. 
And he won four times at Indy with him.  
</P>
<P>
 Roger won with Bobby Unser. Then, Danny Sullivan. Then Al Unser. Then Emerson 
Fittipaldi. Last Sunday, he won with Al Unser Jr. Four different engines, seven 
different drivers. Two generations of Unsers.  
</P>
<P>
 That is awesome. Dynasty stuff. The chauffeurs didn't seem to make all that 
difference. When Fittipaldi crashed last Sunday with 15 laps to go, his 
teammate, Little Al, was running right behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, the carpers used to shout, "Break up the Yankees!" They didn't. 
They copied them. 
</P>
<P>
 They complained about Rockne and Notre Dame. In horse racing, they picked on 
Calumet Farms. 
</P>
<P>
 What were the Yankees supposed to do? Swap franchises with the St. Louis 
Browns? What was Notre Dame supposed to do? Get in the Mid-American Conference? 
 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the American way. You don't penalize excellence, you emulate it.  
</P>
<P>
 It's expensive? Hey! Where could Mercedes get that kind of publicity, 
advertising? How many millions of dollars would it have to spend to get the 
kind of exposure winning the world's most important race brings it?  
</P>
<P>
 Detroit turned its back on Indy racing years ago. The activists -- who would 
be the only ones having any fun if they were able to remake the world the way 
they want it -- had bullied them into thinking any association with speed would 
detract from their campaign for safety.  
</P>
<P>
 As if safety ever sold a single car. "My air bags are better than your air 
bags," is not the stuff of legend. "My car won Indianapolis," is.  
</P>
<P>
 In the military, a guy with this much edge in smarts over his adversary is 
known as "the Swamp Fox," or "the Desert Fox" or "the Iron Chancellor" or some 
such.  
</P>
<P>
 At Indy, Penske is peerless. But they call him to task. They mutter darkly 
about changing the rules. He beats them at their own game. He should be "the 
Wizard of the Wabash." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't used to be a sin to win in this country.

WHALERS SOLD, TO STAY IN HARTFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hartford Whalers were sold Wednesday night for $47.5 million to two 
Michigan computer company executives who intend to keep the team in Hartford 
for at least four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasers, Peter Karmanos and Thomas Thewes, are the principal owners of 
Compuware Corp. They have been seeking an NHL franchise for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Connecticut Development Authority had to approve the sale after majority 
owner Richard Gordon signed a lease last year that gave the state first option 
to buy the Whalers in exchange for Connecticut providing financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the agreement will be announced today at the governor's office. The 
sale also must be approved by the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Compuware and the William F. Dowling Group had presented proposals to the CDA, 
which voted unanimously for Compuware. 
</P>
<P>
 If the CDA had failed to line up a buyer for the team by June 30, Gordon would 
have been allowed to sell the team to an out-of-state buyer.

STANLEY CUP FINALS; MCLEAN DEAL PAYS FOR CANUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kirk McLean's world turned upside down that day nearly seven years ago when 
the New Jersey Devils traded him to the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sad moment because I had a lot of friends in New Jersey," he said. 
"Being from the East Coast, from the Toronto area, I didn't know much about 
Vancouver. It worked out in the long run. To this point, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to McLean's spectacular goaltending, the Canucks need three more 
victories to win their first Stanley Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 His 52-save performance Tuesday in the Canucks' 3-2 series-opening triumph 
puts pressure on the New York Rangers to win tonight, before the series moves 
to Vancouver for Games 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have confidence and the feeling you're going to win, especially 
in the playoffs," McLean said Wednesday. "Pat (Quinn, Vancouver's coach and 
general manager) came up with a good saying in our first series, against 
Calgary: 'Instead of being afraid to lose, don't be afraid to win.' We've taken 
that to heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn's acquisition of McLean and Greg Adams for center Patrik Sundstrom on 
Sept. 15, 1987 was his first major trade. It was a gamble, and he initially was 
on the losing end. Sundstrom led the Devils to the semifinals in 1988, while 
McLean and Adams built respectable but unspectacular careers in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sweeter night for them -- or for Quinn -- than Tuesday, when 
McLean put on a dazzling display and Adams scored the winning goal. Sundstrom 
has long since left the NHL and returned to Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't sure if Kirk would turn out or not, and he had some up-and-down 
seasons for us," Quinn said. "We've seen a great maturing in Kirk. He has 
developed real confidence in his style and his ability, and more important, we 
feel he can deal with the ups and downs of being an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 McLean has won 13 playoff games, 10 fewer than he won all season. His 23-26-3 
record and .891 save percentage gave no hint of how well he would play this 
spring, that he could win three consecutive overtime games against the Flames 
and begin a 12-2 Vancouver run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers came at him in waves Tuesday. McLean frustrated them time and 
again -- and not with luck. He stopped a breakaway by Mark Messier in the first 
minute of the third period, with the Rangers pressing for a 2-0 lead; and he 
turned back successive quick shots by Esa Tikkanen, Steve Larmer and Stephane 
Matteau in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't done anything different as far as my preparation," said McLean, who 
has a 2.11 playoff goals-against average with a .935 save percentage. "Things 
didn't go the way I wanted on the win side during the season. My other stats, I 
was pretty happy with, but the bottom line is winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things seem to be bouncing for me personally, but we're really like two 
different teams. We're different than we were during the regular season. We got 
too individual. We lost a lot of one-goal games because maybe guys were trying 
to beat (opponents) at the blue line. In the playoffs, we've changed that. 
We're playing a better mental game, playing smart, and guys are really playing 
for each other. It's a pleasure to watch from where I'm standing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a nightmare from the Rangers' standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just keep shooting and get people in front of the net and hope that he 
can't do that every game," defenseman Brian Leetch said. "If he makes 52 saves 
a game, then obviously, we're in trouble. But that's probably not going to 
happen, and we just have to put more traffic in front and keep putting the puck 
on net." 
</P>
<P>
 McLean is ready for whatever the Rangers throw at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to get here, and this may be the only chance I get," he said. "It 
may be the chance of a lifetime, and we're going to make the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger Coach Mike Keenan said the only change he plans tonight is "to convince 
Mr. McLean that it won't happen again." He also lamented his team's power-play 
failures, the Rangers having gone 0 for 4 with 10 shots. . . . Ranger goalie 
Mike Richter, who faced 31 shots, blamed himself for the loss. "I didn't come 
through as much as I could have," he said. "You win and lose as a team, but you 
know as a goaltender that if I saved the second shot (a poke by Martin 
Gelinas), the game is over and we win." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger defenseman Kevin Lowe, who has a sore right shoulder, is questionable 
tonight. . . . General manager meetings Wednesday produced no rule changes. New 
King GM Sam McMaster attended his first session. "I just listened," he said. . 
. . Commissioner Gary Bettman told the general managers that collective 
bargaining talks will resume after the playoffs.

GRAF ACCEPTS PIERCE'S CHALLENGE AS FEAR TAKES A BACK SEAT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steffi Graf, 24, has won 15 Grand Slam tournaments, finished second seven 
times, is 42-1 this year and is seeking her fifth consecutive major title. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Pierce, 19, has never reached the semifinals of a Grand Slam event, is 
19-8 this year and has not won a set against Graf in two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was a bit strange that Graf was asked if she feared Pierce today in the 
semifinals of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not scared about anything," the top-ranked Graf replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, who has rolled into the semifinals on a blistering pace, losing a 
record-setting six games in five matches, offered a similar sentiment, saying: 
"I'm not afraid of nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pierce has not faced the likes of Graf during her Roland Garros run the 
last 10 days, and realizes her next assignment on Center Court will not be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for every single point of every game of every set you need to be 
mentally tough and in very good shape because she doesn't make mistakes," 
Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She plays very aggressive, and you just have to keep the ball deep and move 
really well to be well positioned when Steffi attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf is aware of the pressure of facing Pierce, who is playing for France, 
although she was born in Montreal and lives in Florida.  
</P>
<P>
 "She has all the shots to come up to the top," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even against her? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that we will see." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's other semifinal will match Spain's No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and 
No. 3 Conchita Martinez, who are a contrast in development if not styles. 
Although both grew up in Catalonia, as did Sergi Bruguera, a men's semifinalist 
here, Sanchez Vicario and Martinez took different paths to the top echelon of 
women's tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario, 22, was brought along by the Spanish Tennis Federation, 
whereas Martinez, 22, had to go to Switzerland to get the support she needed to 
develop her game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario has had considerably more success. She won the 1989 French 
Open and reached Grand Slam event finals three other times. Martinez will be 
playing in her second semifinal after advancing that far at Wimbledon last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a hard match because we know (Arantxa) is a fighter," 
Martinez said. "If I can be patient . . . I think I have a chance."

<P>
 The Angels are close to trading left fielder Dwight Smith to the Baltimore 
Orioles for left-handed reliever Brad Pennington, according to highly placed 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels and Orioles confirmed they have talked seriously the past few days, 
but the Angels declined to comment publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have been attempting to trade Smith for weeks, according to several 
clubs, but the Orioles expressed serious interest only this week, offering a 
pitcher the Angels covet. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trade is made, the Angels will move Jim Edmonds to left field to 
platoon with Bo Jackson. They then would call up J.T. Snow from triple-A 
Vancouver to let him be the everyday first baseman, or have him platoon with 
Eduardo Perez.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith is batting .270 (before Wednesday) with four homers and 17 runs batted 
in. Although he is a valuable hitter and popular in the clubhouse, the Angels 
consider him a defensive liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennington, 25, is 6 feet 5 and capable of throwing 95 m.p.h. He was 0-1 with 
a 12.00 ERA this season when he was optioned April 25 to triple-A Rochester, 
one day after yielding a three-run homer to Seattle outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade also would reduce the Angel payroll. Smith earns a base salary of 
$700,000; Pennington earns $130,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels confirmed Wednesday that John Farrell will get one more start 
before they decide on his future. Farrell, 1-2 with a 9.00 ERA, probably will 
start sometime next week, although Manager Marcel Lachemann said it's still 
possible that Farrell could start Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many good things about John Farrell," Lachemann said, "you just 
can't give up on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann said it's possible Farrell could be a reliever before his next 
start, but no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels turned down Cleveland's request for an Aug. 15 makeup date, and now 
will play a doubleheader Sept. 2 in Cleveland to make up for Tuesday's rainout. 
Cleveland now will have five doubleheaders in the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Scott Lewis underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test 
Wednesday on his sore shoulder, and will undergo a bone scan today. The Angels 
fear the injury could keep him out past the all-star break. BOB NIGHTENGALE

ANGEL PLAYERS TOLD TO PREPARE FOR STRIKE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel players were told by the Major League Players Assn. Wednesday to prepare 
for a possible July 1 strike authorization vote that could halt the baseball 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, in an informal poll, say they will provide strike approval to Don 
Fehr, executive director of the players' union, when the vote is conducted. 
Once Fehr has obtained the authorization of a majority of major league players, 
he could call a strike at any time, thereby possibly threatening the All-Star 
game on July 12 in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of us feel the sooner the better," Angel left fielder Bo Jackson 
said. "What we're working for is equal rights, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran infielder Spike Owen said: "I think unless there's some miraculous 
turnaround that propels an agreement, a strike is inevitable. There just seems 
to be no movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr has distributed a memo to players on all 28 teams informing them to 
prepare for a work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The latest word is that we will finally receive the owners' salary-cap 
proposal sometime shortly after the owners meet (next Tuesday through 
Thursday)," he wrote. "Of course, given the record of the past year and a half, 
there is no particular reason to believe that (owners' negotiator Dick) Ravitch 
will, in fact, make the proposal then. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is beyond dispute is that the owners are in no hurry; perhaps hoping 
that the players not strike, but play out the season without a contract. This 
could put the owners in a position to declare an impasse, impose a salary cap 
(gutting free agency and salary arbitration in the process) and the terms of 
any other proposals that they have made on players following the World Series, 
daring you to strike in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "In short, the owners want to test your resolve once again . This is no 
surprise; the owners have either locked you out or forced you to strike in each 
negotiation since 1972." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he will provide comprehensive reports on the status of the 
negotiations June 16 in Chicago, and also present the results of player 
bargaining surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look good," said pitcher Mark Langston, Angel player 
representative.

 The Angels, determining that left fielder Dwight Smith is expendable, have had 
trade discussions that would send him to the Baltimore Orioles for left-handed 
reliever Brad Pennington, according to highly placed sources. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Orioles are trying to talk the Angels into players other than 
Pennington. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Orioles continue to balk about trading Pennington, sources say, 
another team has inquired about Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have been trying to trade Smith for weeks, according to several 
clubs, but it was only this week that the Orioles expressed serious interest. 
</P>
<P>
 If Smith is traded, the Angels will move Jim Edmonds into left field to 
platoon with Bo Jackson. The Angels then would call up J.T. Snow from triple-A 
Vancouver, where he is hitting .294 with eight home runs, to let him play first

average, probably will start some time next week, although Manager Marcel 
Lachemann said that it's still possible the start could come Sunday. Starting 
pitcher Brian Anderson, who pitched in rehabilitation Wednesday for Class-A 
Lake Elsinore, will throw on the side this weekend and join the rotation next 
week. . . . The Angels turned down Cleveland's request for an Aug. 15 makeup

<P>
 The Dodgers will make a lump-sum payment of $4,857,143 to Darryl Strawberry by 
July 1, according to the terms of their May 25 settlement, The Times has 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 This amount consists of the balance of his 1994 salary, or $2,357,143, and 
half of the $5 million due him for next season, which was the final year of his 
five-year, $20.25-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry could clear 10-day release waivers Friday, making him a free agent.

BASEBALL DRAFT; ANGELS FOCUS ON WAVE PITCHER; DODGERS LOOK LEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having reaped immediate rewards from Darren Dreifort and Brian Anderson, the 
Dodgers and Angels are expected to tap the college pitching market again in 
today's first round of the amateur draft, which extends through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, selecting sixth, are almost certain to pick Pepperdine 
right-hander Cade Gaspar, who was 6-1 with a 2.39 earned-run average for the 
33-20 Waves. 
</P>
<P>
 It is less certain who the Dodgers will take with the 13th choice, but they 
are believed to be leaning toward Wake Forest left-hander Bret Wagner, rather 
than catcher Paul Konerko of Chaparral High in Scottsdale, Ariz. Wagner was 9-3 
with a 3.29 ERA for the 37-20 Demon Deacons. 
</P>
<P>
 "As bad as we need a left-hander, I'm sure we'd be forced to take one if 
available," a Dodger scout said, adding that the farm system is as devoid of 
southpaw starters as the varsity's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Dodgers' choice could be influenced by the selections ahead of 
them. They are also known to be high on St. John's left-hander C.J. Nitkowski, 
thought to be bound for the Minnesota Twins, who have the eighth pick, and 
right-hander Jaret Wright of Katella High in Anaheim, son of former Angel 
left-hander Clyde Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Wright is said to have the best arm among the nation's 
draft-eligible high school pitchers. If not selected by either the Colorado 
Rockies, who are seventh, or the Cincinnati Reds, who are ninth, Wright will 
probably be available when the Dodgers get their turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The drafting order is determined by last year's finish. The New York Mets get 
the No. 1 selection and are expected to pick Florida State right-hander Paul 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland Athletics, who are next, will take either Kent State pitcher 
Dustin Hermanson or outfielder Ben Grieve of Martin High in Arlington, Tex., 
son of Tom Grieve, the Texas Rangers' general manager. Then the San Diego 
Padres, who are No. 3, will take either Hermanson or Grieve, depending on 
Oakland's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Milwaukee Brewers, in fourth, are leaning toward Arizona State third 
baseman Antone Williamson, and the Florida Marlins are then expected to select 
shortstop Josh Booty of Evangel Christian High in Shreveport, La., using owner 
Wayne Huizenga's wallet to talk Booty out of an LSU football scholarship as one 
of the nation's leading quarterback prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we draft him, it will be because we feel we can sign him," Marlin scouting 
director Gary Hughes said of Booty. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar, son of former major league infielder Rod Gaspar, is expected to go to 
the Angels next. He and his family discussed finances with Angel officials at 
his Mission Viejo home Tuesday and Wednesday. The 6-foot-3, 185-pound player, 
previously a shortstop, switched to the mound full time this year. An Angel 
official said Anderson, the third pick in the first round from Wright State 
last year, was more advanced than Gaspar, but only in his experience and 
command. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Gaspar, the official said: "He's not that far behind (Anderson) and may 
have better pitches, particularly his curve. I look at him as only a year 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers made Dreifort the No. 2 selection in last year's draft and he 
moved directly from Wichita State to set-up and closer roles in the Dodger 
bullpen. This year's 13th slot does not afford the same "quick fix" 
opportunity, scouting director Terry Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dreiforts are rare," Reynolds said of the type of player capable of 
moving directly to the major leagues. "In any draft, there may not be more than 
one or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the 1994 draft class seemed typical of recent years, with 
quality at the top and a preponderance of right-handed pitchers. "Once you get 
to the other positions, it thins out in a hurry," he said. "I'll bet the 
right-handed pitchers outnumber the other positions 10 to 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and Dreifort illustrate the force-fed opportunities available at the 
pitching-thin and budget-minded major league level. As Hughes, the Florida 
scouting director, noted: "College pitchers will go off the board in a hurry, 
but then they always do." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Gaspar and Wright, the only Southland prospects with a chance to be 
taken in the first round are Cal State Fullerton center fielder Dante Powell, 
who turned down a $425,000 offer from the Toronto Blue Jays three years ago and 
might have trouble matching that now, and USC third baseman Aaron Boone, who is 
more likely to be taken in the second round and eventually might be moved to 
catcher, following in the footsteps of his dad, Bob Boone.

U.S. CUTS 3, NAMES 22 FOR CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Soccer Federation announced its 22-man World Cup roster Wednesday by 
making the last three player cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The players released were midfielders Chris Henderson and Dominic Kinnear and 
defender Brian Bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's moves do not provide insight into the major question concerning 
the U.S. team: Which 11 players will start and at which positions? That 
decision does not have to be announced until the day of each game, and U.S. 
Coach Bora Milutinovic is likely to wait until the last possible moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining players, six were members of the 1990 World Cup team and 
seven were 1992 Olympians. Milutinovic looked at 70 players in a three-year 
period and began this year with a 45-player pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, who attended UCLA, was the youngest player in the '90 World Cup but 
didn't play. He had been on the wing for the U.S. team, opposite Cobi Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinnear, 26, was born in Glascow, Scotland, and had played several positions 
in the midfield. His playing time this year was reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Bliss joined the team for two internationals last week, then injured his left 
knee Sunday while playing in the German second division. He is expected to 
undergo surgery today. U.S. World Cup Soccer Team

ROSE BOWL GETS WORLD CUP DRY RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The game Saturday between the World Cup soccer teams of the United States and 
Mexico is expected to have an educational benefit for three groups: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The teams, because it is the last warm-up for each before the World Cup 
tournament begins June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The World Cup staff at the Rose Bowl, because it is the first soccer game 
at the venue in two years and its only dry run before its first World Cup 
match, June 18 between Colombia and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The fans, because Saturday's game will be a chance for them to familiarize 
themselves with the special procedures that will be followed during all eight 
World Cup games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 For David Simmons, venue executive director, Saturday's game is the best 
possible tuneup because games with Mexico traditionally draw large crowds. 
Simmons said tickets are selling at a "phenomenal" rate and officials expect a 
crowd of about 60,000 for the game, which starts at 4:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons stressed the importance of buying tickets ahead of time to avoid 
delays on game day, adding that parking will be limited and car-pooling is 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be some major differences between the World Cup operations and this 
game," Simmons said. "We don't have all the systems in place, but there'll be a 
greater degree of World Cup presence. We'll have a major game critique on 
Monday to analyze what worked and what didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Many World Cup security procedures will be followed, including the ban on 
alcohol, both in the Rose Bowl and its parking lots. Fans will enter the 
stadium through two security checkpoints. The first checkpoint will include 
searches for contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 Street access and parking in the neighborhoods surrounding the Rose Bowl will 
be restricted to residents with passes. Rose Bowl parking lots will open five 
hours before the game, and the gates will open three hours before the game.

WILSON ENJOYS WORKING VACATION; HOCKEY: OFF-SEASON FOR DUCK COACH INCLUDES 
LEADING THE U.S. IN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS, DRAFT HOMEWORK AND REST, PERHAPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's a road runner on Ron Wilson's back fence and the Stanley Cup finals on 
his TV. Surprisingly, he's trying to watch both. 
</P>
<P>
 June figures to be a month of relaxation for Wilson, a chance to reflect and 
to look ahead. He can golf and take his family on vacation, temporarily pushing 
aside concerns about slow-skating defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks didn't make the playoffs, but Wilson might as well have. He 
spent the better part of three weeks in April and May coaching the U.S. 
national team to a fourth-place finish in the World Hockey Championships. Only 
now is he beginning to enjoy his summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 There's been a lot to digest, almost all of it surprising and pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go through one experience and you think, 'Maybe I was just lucky, maybe 
it was just a good group in Anaheim and maybe they managed themselves,' " 
Wilson said of coaching the Ducks to a 33-46-5 record and a fourth-place finish 
in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went over there (to the World Championships) thinking, 'This could turn out 
to be a real disaster.' But things worked out. We approached the games the same 
way as with the Mighty Ducks. I guess it's helped reinforce the things we did 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 No TV announcer blathered about miracles on ice. Newspapers devoted no more 
than a few paragraphs to the story. There were no post-tournament parades or 
visits to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Wilson, there will always be fond memories of May 4 in Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he coached the United States to its first victory over Russia since 
the 1980 Olympics. That Duck goaltender Guy Hebert stopped 53 of 54 shots in a 
3-1 quarterfinal victory, made it even sweeter for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and superior opposition sent the U.S. team off course in the 
semifinal and bronze medal game. The United States lost to Finland, 8-0, in the 
semifinal, then was beaten by Sweden, 7-2, in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
 A disappointing finish to be sure, but Wilson's confidence soared after the 
victory over the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a little bit of the fear off next year," he said. "Everybody's been 
telling me it's going to be twice as difficult next year. Of course, they were 
the same people who told me not to take the Duck job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be confident when you do things that turn out well. Now, I'm 
looking forward to next year." 
</P>
<P>
 These are feel-good days for Wilson, who can't seem to go wrong with his 
simple, grinding game plan. The Ducks followed the clutch-and-grab style to 33 
victories, tying Florida for the NHL expansion record. And the U.S. team used 
the system to gain its best World Championship finish since winning a bronze 
medal in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go to my grave saying if Guy didn't get hurt we should have had a 
medal," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert injured a hamstring, then pulled a groin muscle midway through the 
semifinal. Finally, Wilson was forced to take him out of the game. The pain was 
too great and the game was clearly lost by then. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had seen Hebert perform well all season, but his play in the World 
Championships still surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe he played so well," Wilson said. "Incredible. To be 
honest, when we had the injury to Hebert our chances went down the drain. I 
didn't realize how important he was." 
</P>
<P>
 The game against the Russians matched Hebert against Duck teammate Mikhail 
Shtalenkov. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Wilson cornered Hebert and Shtalenkov and delivered a 
tongue-in-check motivational speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'All right guys, whoever wins this game is our No. 1 goalie next 
year,' " Wilson said. "Not many people realized how good our goalies were until 
this tournament. It was really fun for me. I didn't know who to root for." 
</P>
<P>
 Rest assured the American players had no such feelings. According to Wilson, 
they believed the Russians tanked their final pool-play game, losing 
intentionally to avoid playing a stronger Canadian team in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were figuring we were an easy mark, but it was easy motivation," Wilson 
said. "We were just flying after that. We went over there to have fun, but we 
changed our game, going to a more trapping game. They were unprepared for that. 
And with Guy's goaltending we won easily." 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, the Ducks' Don McSween excelled, according to Wilson. Forward 
Craig Janney, who joined the team after the Blues' first-round playoff loss to 
Dallas, was the offensive standout. Edmonton forwards Doug Weight and Shjon 
Podein also played well. 
</P>
<P>
 But like the Ducks, the U.S. team struggled to find goal-scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 So Wilson kept things simple, introducing an aggressive fore-checking system 
for the first few games before going into a defensive shell in the later 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little disappointed at the end that we didn't have it," Wilson said. 
"But (Duck General Manager) Jack Ferreira says, 'Look at the lineup you had.' 
Everyone over there said, 'Jeez, you guys did really well.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But you always think you should have done better."

SCOTT, 40, IS HOPING TO BE MORE THAN AN OLD IRONMAN OF THE SEA; TRIATHLON: 
FORMER RECORD-HOLDER, MOUNTING A COMEBACK, WILL COMPETE IN PERFORMING ARTS 
EVENT IN MISSION VIEJO. 
</P>

<P>
 Forty-year-old Dave Scott, a six-time Hawaii Ironman Triathlon champion, is 
making a comeback. Just don't mention his name in the same breath with those 
out-of-breath over-40 athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "George Foreman is an out-of-shape publicity hound," Scott said of the former 
heavyweight boxing champ. "Mark Spitz was premature to think he could make the 
'92 U.S. Olympic swim team. The times he was posting in his comeback, there 
were some 12-year-olds who could beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I think those guys were an embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
 So how was Scott's first race on the comeback trail? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was painful and embarrassing," he chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who lives and trains in Boulder, Colo., is preparing for the Ironman in 
October, his first since 1989. Part of his tune-up will be Sunday's Orange 
County Performing Arts Center Triathlon at Lake Mission Viejo, and he hopes it 
won't be a repeat of his comeback debut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulf Coast Triathlon on May 8 was the first race for Scott since June of 
1991, when he raced in Nice, France. The comeback race in Panama City, Fla., 
turned out to be a big pain in the . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After finishing the swimming portion of the race in good shape, Scott got on 
his new bike and stayed among the leaders until he suffered severe cramps . . . 
in his gluteus maximus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I broke the cardinal rule and changed equipment too soon before the race," 
Scott said. "I was fine out of the water, but on the new bike, I started 
cramping around the 35th mile to the point that I had to stop sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott finished the race, and although it was disappointing, there were some 
positives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fairly pleased with the swim and I was still in the hunt at the 12- to 
13-mile mark on the bike," Scott said. Still, the road back will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 A nagging knee injury and lack of motivation pushed him away from the sport as 
he eased into semi-retirement, spending more time with his wife, Anna, and his 
sons, Ryan, 4 1/2, and Drew, 3 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 But retirement was the furthest thing from Scott's mind when he finished the 
1989 Ironman, a race that includes a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, 
followed by a marathon run. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '89 race, Scott shattered his Ironman record by 18 1/2 minutes, but he 
finished second behind Mark Allen. Allen finished the race in 8 hours 9 minutes 
14 seconds, breaking away from Scott in the 24th mile of the run. Scott 
finished 58 seconds behind Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I finished second in the Ironman, I thought I would be back in '90," 
Scott said. "But my knee wasn't strong enough. Soon, a one-month layoff became 
two months, then it was six months and that turned into a year . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to tell one of my friends that I didn't want to be racing when I 
turned 40," Scott joked. " 'Those old guys are slow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Scott is intrigued at how far he can push himself. With his rehabilitated 
knee and new dedication to training, Scott wants to find out how close he can 
get to his prime form. But he's not making any predictions about the triathlon 
at Lake Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "To expect to win in Orange County would be the furthest thing from my mind," 
Scott said. "It will be interesting to see where I stand with some of the 
gorillas of the short-course races." 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the men's field are Spencer Smith, who won the 1993 World 
Championship, Brad Kearns, who won the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
Triathlon in 1990 and '91, and the 1993 Orange County runner-up Andy Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of this year's race -- which features a 1.5-kilometer swim, 
40-kilometer bike race, and 10-kilometer run -- will win a Mazda Miata. The top 
three finishers will qualify for the U.S. team at the Goodwill Games in St. 
Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scott's ultimate challenge will be the Ironman in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conditions are always horrendous in Hawaii, so you have to focus mentally to 
do well," Scott said. "I think I still have that mental ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott grew up in Davis and attended UC Davis where he played water polo. The 
hot, sometimes windy, agricultural plains with the nearby mountains and Lake 
Berryessa proved to be ideal training grounds for Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Hawaii, you have hours of relentless conditions that wear on you 
mentally," Scott said. "I spent hundreds of days that replicated that at Davis. 
I never found the Ironman as mind-numbing of an experience as some other people 
have described it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the excitement of doing it again will be an awakening for me." 
</P>
<P>
 That awakening takes its next step Sunday, and you can sense Scott hopes for 
even more when October arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the other competitors will fear me much because, hey, I am 40," 
Scott said. "But that's my excuse, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go to Hawaii and break nine hours, people will say 'Well, you got the 
masters record.' If I have an 8:40, people will still think that's great, but 
say, 'Well, you are still slower than your old record pace.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure George Foreman had some success, but he still wasn't the best in his 
comeback. If I can finish the Ironman around my own record of 8:10, that will 
really open some eyes."

VOLLEYBALL TOUR FINES JOHNSON, STOKLOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capistrano Beach's Adam Johnson and Randy Stoklos of Pacific Palisades have 
been fined $7,500 each and Johnson has been suspended for one tournament by 
officials of the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals beach tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Stoklos violated tour rules by using a conflicting sponsor's 
equipment.Stoklos will be eligible to play this weekend in Grand Haven, Mich., 
but Johnson must sit out because he used the conflicting sponsor's water 
bottles and towels on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoklos was fined $35,000 by the AVP two years ago for violating his contract 
and skipping the Seal Beach Open to play in a tournament in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Stoklos won last weekend's tournament in San Francisco, breaking a 
streak of seven consecutive tournament victories by San Clemente's Karch Kiraly 
and Kent Steffes of Pacfic Palisades.

CSUN THREESOME FACES CHALLENGE AT NCAA MEET; COLLEGE TRACK AND FIELD: MATADOR 
ASSISTANT BELIEVES DUNN, HICKS AND STRICKLIN CAN ACHIEVE ALL-AMERICAN STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of them has been competing on an injured knee that will require surgery 
after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Another did not compete last week because of a strained hamstring. The third 
was the last qualifier in her event. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cal State Northridge assistant John Frazier figures that javelin 
thrower Kristin Dunn, shotputter Joe Hicks and discus thrower Teresa Stricklin 
are capable of earning All-American honors in their respective events in this 
week's NCAA track and field championships at Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
 The top eight finishers with U.S. citizenship will be awarded All-American 
certificates at the meet, which began Wednesday and ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stricklin will compete today, followed by Dunn on Friday and Hicks on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 With Dunn's knee feeling "as well as it has all season," and with Hicks' 
hamstring "getting better every day," Frazier, the team's weight-events coach, 
expects his athletes to perform well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ready to go," Frazier said. "It's just a matter of them getting out 
there and competing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn, a junior who finished 13th in last year's meet, is seeded third behind 
Canadian Valerie Tulloch of Rice and Jenny McCormick of Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulloch, second last year and the NCAA champion in 1992, has a best of 186 
feet 3 inches this season. McCormick placed fifth last season and threw a 
personal best of 179-5 to win the Pacific 10 Conference title last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn rifled the javelin a distance of 174-9 -- topping her previous best by 
nearly 11 feet -- in a meet at Cal State Long Beach last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting (for a big improvement) for a long time," Frazier said. "I 
think she got a little reality check last week when she looked at the national 
list and saw that she was only 16th." 
</P>
<P>
 A season-long battle with an injured left knee also slowed Dunn's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn suffered ligament damage during a workout last September, nursed it back 
to relatively good health by late March, but re-injured it before the Sun Angel 
Invitational at Arizona State in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's experience should help her immensely, Frazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, she was the last thrower to get into the meet," he said. "She was 
a little bit too in awe of the other throwers. But this year, she knows she 
belongs. . . . Last year, she had her baptism of fire. Hopefully, Joe and 
Teresa can skip that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, a senior, is ranked 14th in the 17-man shotput field with a personal 
best of 60-6 3/4. The distance between him and the No. 6 qualifier, though, is 
less than 18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a finish among the top six is definitely possible," Frazier said. 
"There is a very tightly bunched group of guys between 60 and 62 feet where a 
lot can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Stricklin, a junior who has a personal best of 164-8, is the 21st -- and final 
-- qualifier in the discus, but Frazier figures that a top-14 finish is a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had her second-best meet of the season last week so she's ready to go," 
Frazier said.

ROGER, OVER AND IN; QUARTZ HILL'S WORLEY EXPECTED TO BE CHOSEN EARLY IN TODAY'S 
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The members of the Quartz Hill High baseball team are going to be "sick" 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than going to class, they will be at Roger Worley's house, eating 
doughnuts, drinking milk and waiting for the phone call that will make their 
teammate the richest kid in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they'll have lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Just that quickly, it will all culminate for Worley, the Rebels' senior 
right-hander with the fastball that has prompted major league scouting 
directors from across the country to trek into the hot, windy Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them will call Worley's name today in the amateur draft, probably 
before the second round is over. And within a couple of weeks, Worley will 
sign, probably for well in excess of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Worley may be the second player selected from the area, behind 
Newbury Park's Keith Smith, he will almost certainly be among the first to 
sign. (See chart). 
</P>
<P>
 All his life, he has dreamed of playing professional baseball. And shortly 
after his June 15 graduation, that's exactly what he'll be doing. "It's a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Worley's dream seemed all but unattainable until last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a 6-foot-1, 165-pound pitcher with an above-average fastball and little 
else. His confidence was so shaky his coach would use him against only the 
weakest opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would get down on himself really easily and fight himself," Quartz Hill 
Coach Mike Nielson said. "You can tell a kid how good he is, but until he 
actually believes it, that's a big step." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley started to believe late last summer. His fastball suddenly had more 
pop, improving from about 84 m.p.h. to 90 m.p.h., which, in the eyes of a 
baseball scout, is the difference between being nobody and being somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 He also began to master a nasty knuckle-curve that some consider a better 
pitch than his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, now 6-foot-3, 185 pounds, was invited to drive into the Valley every 
Sunday to pitch in scout leagues against other top prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 He was asked to throw in private workouts. Worley and his parents once drove 
more than an hour to Citrus College in Glendora so Worley could throw in front 
of Kansas City Royals' scouts for 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the season began, the scouts were content to follow him from start to start 
with radar guns. More than 35 showed for his first start, and about the same 
number to his last, Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning, it (made me nervous)," Worley said, "but not so much now." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley finished the season with a 5-3 record and a 1.55 earned-run average. In 
58 2/3 innings, he struck out 91 and gave up 35 hits. He walked 34. The numbers 
are good, but not great. He was far from the best pitcher in the area, but he 
might be the first drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 What scouts see in Worley is not how good he is now, but how good he can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need polishing, definitely," Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouts say he lacks command of his pitches. They say his mechanics are flawed. 
They say he lacks poise. They say he can throw, but he can't pitch . 
</P>
<P>
 Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional coaches can teach all that. And they also expect Worley to put on 
more weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not filled out yet," Nielson said. "I'm sure (pro coaches) can find 
another couple miles an hour just straightening out his mechanical flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he's got another four or five miles an hour to go, then you're 
getting into really scary territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Scary territory? How about batting against a kid with a 90 m.p.h. fastball 
that could wind up anywhere? Antelope Valley first baseman David Nichols took a 
Worley fastball in the batting helmet during a game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really know what happened at first," Nichols said. "I felt it and 
just remember running to first base." 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill catcher Sean Potter said he had trouble catching some of Worley's 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple times he just threw it over my head," Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nielson: "He could just be dominating at times. I think one of our 
pitfalls was sometimes he'd be so dominating, then someone would hit the ball 
and it would take us by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The scouts were not dissuaded by Worley's problems on the mound, until a game 
in April against Antelope Valley. Worley threw a fastball and felt a twinge in 
his elbow. He came out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the worst experience I've ever had," Worley said. "I thought, 
'Shoot, I'm done.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That night, about 40 scouts called Worley's home to ask about his condition, 
Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone left the game and called us here on a car phone and asked if we 
needed an orthopedic surgeon and I thought, 'What!!' " Worley's mother, 
Bernadette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley was fine. Just a pinched nerve. But his father had to fax a letter from 
a doctor to all 28 major league clubs, assuring them the injury was not 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley has quickly become accustomed to the intricacies that come with life as 
a prospect. When scouts visit his home -- and more than 20 have -- they usually 
bring a standard major league psychological examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got it memorized," Worley joked. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a scrapbook about four inches thick that includes business cards from 
scouts representing every major league club except the Pittsburgh Pirates and 
letters from dozens of colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got one from Stanford today," Worley said with a shrug. "There's 
Miami, Long Beach State, USC, Pepperdine. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The college letters are nice, Worley said, but he has no plans to play college 
baseball. Scholarship offers could have improved Worley's leverage in 
negotiating a signing bonus, but he also might have scared off some scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt you put your cards on the table and be honest," said 
Worley's father, Roger Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley should still have a nice little bank-account-starter soon. Baseball 
America magazine this week listed Worley the 51st best prospect in the nation. 
For the sake of reference, last year's 51st pick was Tony Fuduric, a 
right-handed high school pitcher from Middlefield, Ohio. Fuduric signed with 
the Detroit Tigers for $176,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley is virtually guaranteed a six-figure deal if he is selected by the end 
of the second round -- and most scouts figure he will be -- but as the draft 
approached, Worley remained cautiously optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just love to be in the top five rounds," he said. "That would be 
awesome for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard guys say they were told they were going to be drafted in the first 
round and they don't go until the eighth. Just getting drafted is an honor."

NEW-LOOK RAIDERS KICK OFF MINI-CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether they play their home games in Los Angeles or Oakland this fall, the 
Raiders will have a new look. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident Wednesday when they opened their three-day mini-camp without 
several familiar veterans, including five starters from last season's 10-6 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive lineman Steve Wright will join defensive tackle Howie Long on the 
Raiders' retired list. And linebacker David Fulcher and offensive linemen Todd 
Peat and Ken Lanier, all unrestricted free agents, are not expected to be 
re-signed. Offensive lineman Max Montoya is also an unrestricted free agent but 
is expected to announce his retirement soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Joe Kelly and fullback Steve Smith had been released, and tight end 
Ethan Horton signed with the Washington Redskins as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at our organization over the years, you'll see that we have never 
done an overhaul," Coach Art Shell said at the team's El Segundo practice site. 
"We've slowly made some changes, and I like the core of players we have on the 
team now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had 25 new faces working out, among them running back Harvey 
Williams and defensive back Albert Lewis, both signed as free agents from 
Kansas City. Other key additions include guard Kevin Gogan, who signed from 
Dallas, and tight end Jamie Williams, who signed from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will practice twice a day through Friday.

MANN'S SOLO DECISION YIELDED A NET GAIN; CITY SECTION TENNIS: TAFT SOPHOMORE, 
AFTER FORGOING BASEBALL, WILL PLAY TODAY FOR THE SINGLES TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, a bright future in baseball seemed to await Dylan Mann, a 
Little League all-star as a pitcher and shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mann felt the urge to go off alone, and today the Taft High sophomore will 
be on his own at The Racquet Centre in Studio City, putting an undefeated 
season on the line in the sport that took him away from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann (15-0), in his first season as a high school tennis player, will face 
top-seeded Robert Williams (16-0), a sophomore from Dorsey, in the 2 p.m. 
singles final of the City Section individual championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved baseball so much better than tennis," Mann, 15, said. "There's a lot 
more to baseball. There's the social aspect. But when I got a little bit older, 
I realized I wanted to play for myself. I had a problem playing on a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't function well on a team where they were contributing to my efforts. 
I like being independent. Tennis is an individual sport where I control what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann could not have controlled his destiny better this season. Not only is he 
undefeated in matches, he was 12-0 in sets during the City team tournament in 
which singles players competed in a single-set, round-robin format. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he's a late bloomer in a sport dominated by youth, Mann has genetics 
on his side. His father, Eric, is a teaching pro who played three years on the 
professional tour. He played all the major tournaments and was ranked among the 
top 50 in the world in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very good at baseball," Eric Mann said of his son. "But at 12 he had 
to make a decision. He could have gone on and played at the next level. I was 
trying to persuade him into tennis but I never pushed him." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Dylan's youth league all-star manager did the pushing. The manager 
kicked Mann off the team when he skipped one practice to play in the final of a 
Ventura age-group tennis tournament. Now Mann is seeded eighth in the 
16-and-under boys' division by the Southern California Tennis Assn., and 
baseball is a memory. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-foot-1, 160 pounds, Mann is an inch taller and only 15 pounds lighter 
than his father. He dominates most high school opponents even though his 
serve-and-volley game is unpolished. But Mann said he must be careful against 
Williams, who defeated him, 6-2, 6-2, earlier this year in an age-group 
tournament and is currently seeded 10th by the SCTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just never got started. I couldn't get anything going," Mann said of his 
loss to Williams. "He didn't let me get on my game. He played a good match. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I learned from that match. I'm going to have to keep more balls in play. 
I'm not going to be able to go for it a lot, because he plays an aggressive 
game and he makes you pay for unforced errors. If I hit myself out of position, 
he'll take advantage of it. He's a smart player. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I feel like I'm hitting the ball well." 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus among City coaches is that Mann already shows the potential to 
play in the Division I college ranks. Taft Coach Marvin Jones knew the first 
time he saw Mann that Taft could have its first City champion in his 10 years 
as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got all the tools necessary to make that happen," Jones said. "If you 
have the skills and the dedication, good things can happen. And he has both." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing high school tennis for the first time this year, Mann didn't know what 
to expect. "But I didn't expect to win every match," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose today, Mann said, the City singles title won't carry much 
significance in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure it really means anything in the tennis world," Mann said. "In 
terms of goals, it's not so much a goal of mine as a tennis player. It's more 
of a personal goal. I would like to win. I think it would be pretty cool."

THEIR MINISTRY IS KEEPING YOU AWAKE IN THE SEAT; FURNITURE: IT'S NOT A 
GLAMOROUS BUSINESS, BUT WITH COMFORT AS THE GOAL, PEW PEDDLERS ARE ALWAYS ON 
THE LOOKOUT FOR THE NEXT FRONTIER IN SANCTUARY SEATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the quirky world of pew sales, companies pose their products in front of 
Yosemite Falls, engage in church-seat espionage and offer tubs of corned beef 
to island chieftains. 
</P>
<P>
 They also conduct important pew research on such topics as the relation 
between bench comfort and sermon attention spans -- and, in the eternal quest 
for pew perfection, they pioneer such technical breakthroughs as the talking 
pew and the reversible chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average person doesn't think about where pews come from," says Durand 
Overholtzer, whose Modesto-based church furniture company is one of the giants 
of pewdom. "But it's a real competitive (and) . . . creative business." 
</P>
<P>
 Overholtzer, who traces his woodworking ancestry back 1,000 years to a village 
near Zurich, runs a sprawling factory where many of the chairs in the lobby and 
offices are pews. In his own office, next to a bookcase filled with religious 
works and a biography of Lee Iaccoca, is the talking pew of Las Vegas. (The 
seat, which features hidden wiring and loudspeakers, was custom-built for a 
Greek Orthodox congregation worried about sanctuary acoustics.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's a considerable leap from the church accommodations of the past. Until the 
Middle Ages, pews didn't even exist. People stood, wandered around, chatted and 
even brought in pets, says historian Colleen McDannell of the University of 
Utah. It wasn't until about the 13th Century, in Northern Europe, that the 
first pews -- made of stone or wood -- are believed to have appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1700s, church seats had evolved into elaborate private booths -- owned 
or rented by families -- and were such status symbols that people handed them 
down in wills and fought over them in lawsuits. Pew rental fees brought in so 
much money that churches didn't even introduce collection plates until the late 
1800s, McDannell says. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, pews developed into the stretched-out benches familiar today. But 
innovations continued. In 1946, an Idaho company that originally built World 
War II bomb crates, whiskey bars and high school chemistry labs unveiled what 
it claims was the world's first upholstered, spring-cushion pew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd been building restaurant booth seats," says Mike Stoneman, president of 
what eventually became Marshall Church Furniture Co. "We just made them 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Founder Jack Marshall was so certain he had stumbled onto the next frontier in 
sanctuary seating that he undertook a five-year study of the link between pew 
comfort and audience attentiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the idea after a traveling preacher remarked that the same sermon that 
rocked the house in some churches put people to sleep in others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We checked the pews," Stoneman says. "And darned if it didn't boil down to 
seating. . . . The more comfortable the pew, the more attentive the audience. 
It might seem like the opposite would be true, but if you sit on a hard bench, 
after a few minutes you lose your train of thought with the speaker because 
you're thinking about your butt." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It took a reform-minded pontiff, however, to bring padded pews to prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 In a little-known footnote to Catholic Church history, Angelo Giuseppe 
Roncalli (a.k.a. Pope John XXIII) inadvertently ignited a pew revolution when 
he convened the Second Vatican Council in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's subsequent decision to revamp Catholic liturgy and worship space 
led many parishes to begin upholstering their seating, relax the vertical slant 
of pew backs and replace the traditional wooden bench with theater-style 
chairs, says Frank Ulrich, marketing manager for Ohio-based Sauder 
Manufacturing Co., one of the two dominant forces (along with Overholtzer) in 
the pew universe. 
</P>
<P>
 Protestants soon followed, he says, and sitting down on Sunday has never been 
the same. Today, there are paisley pews, tapestry pews, even pews that look and 
feel more like couches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Churches are competing for people on Sunday," Ulrich told one magazine. 
"(They're) competing with La-Z-Boy recliners and golf carts at the country 
club." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the once ubiquitous all-wood bench has fallen so far from grace that 
it now accounts for just a handful of every 100 new pew orders nationwide. 
Overholtzer even stopped making wooden pews from 1970 to 1985 and only resumed 
small-scale production in an attempt to crack the more tradition-bound New 
England church market. (A number of Catholic churches have also hung onto the 
non-upholstered look, but that could change as the benches come to the end of 
their 25- to 50-year life expectancy, industry officials say.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the search for space-age seating continues. Among the most 
recent inventions is Overholtzer's reversible pew, built for a Catholic church 
in Florida that wanted to have seats in a side chapel face one direction for 
normal use and the opposite direction for when the main church overflowed.  
</P>
<P>
 Other manufacturers -- there are about 50 nationwide -- have discovered 
different niches. 
</P>
<P>
 In Azusa, just down the street from a brewery, is L.A.'s pew company to the 
stars, Cardinal Church Furniture. Run by a cowboy boot-clad pew heir who ropes 
steer in his spare time, Cardinal rents church seats to soap operas and 
sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
 All those funerals on "Days of Our Lives" and "General Hospital" are "going to 
pay for my daughter's college education," says company president Johnny 
Lambrecht, whose first name is emblazoned on his belt in silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambrecht, who grew up helping his father make and install sanctuary seating 
(he also used to christen the first pews he assembled for any church with a 
ceremonial wad of chewing gum stuck to the bottom of the seat), sells his 
product to courthouses and funeral parlors, too. 
</P>
<P>
 To consummate a deal, he and his brother load sample seats aboard a 
single-engine plane and fly them to potential customers. Or they just haul out 
the corned beef. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent sales expedition to American Samoa, for example, Cardinal 
officials were advised to bring a five-gallon tub of meat to an island chief 
whose community was interested in pews for its jungle church. (It worked.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other pew companies also have offbeat sales techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Overholtzer Church Furniture, for instance, hands out brochures depicting pews 
at Yosemite, in gardens and on the beach at sunset. Marshall, on the other 
hand, has taken its entire product line to sound labs to see how music and 
noise bounce off the wood and fabric. For years, it even touted a special 
acoustic panel built into every seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pew peddlers, however, resort to more underhanded tactics.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a very ethical business to be in," Marshall's Stoneman says. "I've 
seen a lot of cutthroat, down-and-dirty (methods)." 
</P>
<P>
 Overholtzer, for example, has traced suspicious inquiries for product 
information to spies from a rival company. And Marshall's competitors, Stoneman 
says, have tried to undermine its credibility with conservative evangelical 
customers by falsely suggesting that the company is owned by Mormons (they're 
actually Methodist). 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of such intrigue, it's still not a glamorous business, says 
Lambrecht: "Churches are like restaurants. The pastor is the chef, and we're 
like the guys who make the booths and tables. Nobody comes to a restaurant for 
the booths and tables."

AN EYE FOR STYLE; MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN THE PROVOCATIVE ADS. OR HEARD THE NAME: 
RAMPAGE. FROM A MODEST DREAM, LARRY HANSEL HAS FASHIONED A CLOTHING EMPIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rose-Marie Turk 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he was 20, Larry Hansel had a thriving car detail business and a modest 
dream: He wanted to represent a clothing line and drive cross-country in a van 
"like a cowboy on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen years later, Hansel is president of Rampage Clothing Co., the 
multidivisional, multimillion-dollar firm whose provocative ads cover hundreds 
of L.A. buses and bus benches. A huge beehive of an organization -- where 
employees are encouraged to read self-help books and attend motivational 
seminars -- Rampage has saturated the junior apparel market and is moving full 
speed into its own stores, kiddie boutiques and women's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, Hansel got more than a van. "Instead of doing the limo 
thing," he went for a white Chevrolet Suburban, customized with a bar, 
television and horseshoe-shaped leather sofa. And he now pays others to rep 
seven (soon to be eight) lines. They range from the company's bread-and-butter 
"junior" dresses, knits and recycled clothing to kiddie clothing and CDC, a 
line of contemporary dresses. A private-label division produces merchandise for 
stores such as Mervyn's. 
</P>
<P>
 While the name Rampage (inspired by a newspaper story) and that eye seem to be 
everywhere, the merchandise is not; it is sold only in department stores -- and 
Judy's. Last year, Hansel quietly rescued the chain from bankruptcy, keeping 47 
of 62 stores and bringing them into the black with the Rampage philosophy: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a brand-new vision about business. It's done with product and people. 
The product is more accessible, fresher and presented better. It's more 
exclusive. We make over half of it ourselves, and we don't sell to other 
stores. And there's a fresh new energy. We're looking at how every job is done 
and reworking how the managers take 'ownership' of the stores." 
</P>
<P>
 On a retail roll, Hansel, who believes the word junior is obsolete because of 
shrinking demographics, has plans for 10 Rampage stores "for women 15 to 35." 
The first opened in March in Reno. A second followed in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are just appetizers. The "actual prototype," which Hansel will 
describe only as "urban, raw, sensual, soft" and "a collection of boutiques 
under one roof," is scheduled for an August opening in the Beverly Center. Next 
door will be the first Friends store, a "kiddie boudoir" for girls 4 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So much success so soon with so little start-up money ($30,000) has turned 
Hansel into an unlikely garment Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
 A former high school athlete who "skated through school," he reads Jung and 
such bestsellers as Stephen R. Covey's "Seven Habits of Highly Effective 
People" and M. Scott Peck's "The Road Less Traveled." He claims an aversion to 
interviews ("I haven't been that interested in creating notoriety"). 
</P>
<P>
 But once he is seated behind the glistening mahogany desk in his Downtown L.A. 
headquarters -- surrounded by an executive toy airplane that has sailed into a 
lush potted plant, Japanese art, caricatures by his deceased father and 
photographs of his young nieces -- he slides into easy conversation.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the company has had problems, including delivery snafus, they seem 
small compared with the start-up woes of 11 years ago. "We were 
undercapitalized. We were in the dark looking for the light switch," he 
recalls. A banker, who Hansel swears never glanced at him, only at his business 
plan, threw him the needed credit line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for him, I would not be in business. I didn't go back to the 
bank for a year. I thought if they saw this kid, they would take the loan 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 The story reveals a Hansel trait: He likes to spread the kudos around. Last 
year, he donated $10,000 to Otis College of Art and Design and participated in 
its critics' design program. When he was honored by the school recently (along 
with Cross Colours founders Carl Jones and T.J. Walker and Mossimo founder 
Mossimo Giannulli), he thanked the Rampage team for making him look good and 
the Otis faculty for their skills ("What you are is what I aspire to be"). Then 
he moved on to the students: "You've got those green carrot tops on your head. 
Looking at the world 11 1/2 years ago, I was just as green, and I want to tell 
you, you can grow to be whatever you want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say Hansel's company is growing too fast to survive. Others 
denounce him as a knockoff artist. And while Hansel considers Guess and Esprit 
his primary competition, industry analysts say it is more likely Judy Knapp and 
All That Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 But fans, including Barbara Fields, attribute any negative remarks to sour 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's making some smart moves," says Fields, president of the eponymous buying 
office, which serves as a fashion consultant to retailers. "Buying Judy's was 
one." Opening more stores, including the boutiques to carry existing kids' 
lines such as Rampage Girl, is another, she believes. "Knowing Larry, he's got 
it under control." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Richman, co-owner of the Directives West buying office, agrees: "He's 
bright, he's aggressive, he's focused, and he thinks long term rather than 
short term. I don't think a lot of people in the industry do that." 
</P>
<P>
 David Plummer, owner of a Los Angeles knitwear company and an Otis marketing 
instructor, sees Hansel as both a Renaissance man and "a California 
contemporary man. He never sees any ceiling, any limits. He's got imagination 
and the guts to go with it. He's building an empire, and he's building it 
faster and bigger than most people do, and it's sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a couple of smart sisters, too," Plummer says. "They seem to be on 
top of it as well. And he hires good people and gives them plenty of leash." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything but the sewing of Rampage garments goes on in one place, the 
300,000-square-foot headquarters. "It's like a football stadium," Fields 
marvels. "You almost need roller skates to get from one side to the other." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old former beer bottling plant was destined for demolition until 
Hansel drove around the wood-beamed interior in his car and realized he was 
looking at another "great, great opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A shoeshine stand was his first big opportunity. He was 10 and already 
emulating his Air Force father -- "a Southern country man, a businessman" who 
managed military clubs from Casablanca, where Hansel was born, to Lake Wells, 
Fla., where he went to high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're shining shoes, you really get to know somebody," he says. "I was 
very thirsty for knowledge. I learned a lot. It was like a college education 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointing his French-born mother, who wanted him to be a doctor or a 
lawyer, Hansel dropped out of Mesa Community College in Arizona after one 
semester. Looking for the freedom associated with selling a clothing line, he 
approached Esprit, Ocean Pacific and Made in the Shade. "Everyone laughed," he 
says. But he finally got a chance to count stock for OP in Arizona department 
stores -- at night, after locking up his two detail shops. 
</P>
<P>
 A cousin in Montreal unexpectedly offered him a sportswear line -- and his 
first big break. Hansel moved to San Diego, picked stores from a phone book, 
employed his sister Bridgette as a model and taught himself accounts 
receivables. "All of a sudden, boom! I was doing what I had dreamed of doing. I 
didn't know anything. But I was so energized by being in the club, it didn't 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 After his cousin abandoned the U.S. market, Hansel and Bridgette, now 
Rampage's vice president of sales, developed a sportswear line and took it to 
stores -- in his black Camaro. Their first customer was Judy's, one reason 
Hansel bought the chain. "It's very close and dear to my heart," he says. "It 
has a tremendous heritage that we want to bring back." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he sealed the deal, he had dinner with founder Marcia Israel, who had 
sold the stores to Hong Kong investors in 1989. "As a courtesy," she says, "and 
to tell me how much he loved Judy's and how much of an influence I was in his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansel's charm is evident as he tours the airy Rampage offices occupied 
primarily by women (90% of his executives are women). A slight, dark, handsome 
bachelor who often sports a 5 o'clock shadow and avant-garde Japanese menswear, 
he twirls the dressmakers dummies as if they were dance partners, studying the 
garments, asking questions, passing out the praise, talking numbers: "Eight 
collections a month, 1,000 different styles. We're the most aggressive product 
makers in the country. We produce too much product." 
</P>
<P>
 He embraces his "original pattern maker" and delights her with his 
introduction: "The sexiest 70-year-old in the world." In another room, he asks 
Connie Franko, 24, about her wedding plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Franko has worked with Hansel for seven years. He interviewed her, and she 
recalls being impressed and scared by his capabilities. "He was changing the 
address of the building. And I said to myself: 'Who is this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then as now, her boss is fastidious. Rampage was formerly down the street, at 
1731 Santa Fe. Hansel -- who says, "I was into numbers at the time, and it 
sounded weird" -- received the city's permission to switch to a more sonorous 
1737. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Franko has graduated from receptionist to business manager of 
the sportswear division. A journey, as she calls it, made in typical Rampage 
style. "Basically, I asked for more and more responsibility. I said: 'I'm smart 
and I'll work my ass off for you.' I grew as the company grew. It was great 
timing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in to personal growth," says Hansel, who talks about the Rampage 
"family." 
</P>
<P>
 It includes sisters Bridgette and Michelle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a harmonious team," says Michelle, 32, vice president of the kids 
division. "I think we always thought we would be doing something together 
because we worked at a very young age. Our parents felt very strongly about 
earning and the gratification of earning. I started baby-sitting when I was 11. 
Larry was a paperboy, mowed lawns or did whatever he could get his hands on. My 
mother would say: 'Put part in the bank and part you can spend.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hansel describes his dream business as "an art form. But art is not just about 
designing product. It's about building a relationship and nurturing and caring 
for that relationship and finding solutions that are synergistic and good for 
both people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he could be rushing toward a billion-dollar empire (he puts it at 
$250 million now), Hansel says he doesn't even know how much he has in his 
personal bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money can be great if you can make it work for you and terrible if you become 
a slave of it. And I want to make sure that doesn't happen. I don't see (money) 
as a source of contentment or security or pleasure. For me, the greatest thing 
about business is seeing people and dreams grow. A long time ago, we dreamed 
this thing. And the joy is in living the dream."

 Later, a friend told the boy to look at his mother's driver's license because 
it had all of that information on it. So the boy went back to his house and

BY DESIGN; SUMMER BOOT CAMP; THEY'RE BIG, HEAVY AND NOT JUST FOR SOLDIERS 
ANYMORE. OH, AND GET THIS: COMMANDO BOOTS GO WITH EVERYTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 That's one big, bad, ugly boot. 
</P>
<P>
 With its pliable canvas top, squishy lug soles and rubber toe caps, the summer 
commando looks like this sea son's answer to cruel, crimpy shoes. Despite what 
some call its "ugly auto-mechanic" appearance, this tractor tire of a boot has 
wiggled its way onto the feet of women, men and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resisted buying them for a long time because they're very unattractive and 
my husband thought they were ugly," says Jeanne Baruch, who has a pair of 
black, ankle-high Galibier boots ($125). "I was so excited the first day I got 
them, I left the box open and my cat sprayed all over them," she adds, sounding 
mildly embarrassed. "Now, I have fashionable but stinky feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The boot -- which comes in low-top, ankle-high or pole-climber (calf-high) 
styles -- is surprisingly versatile. Women pair them with short dresses and 
vintage granny dresses as well as with denim shorts and Ts or leggings and 
oversize jackets. Men and children wear them with khakis, shorts, jeans and 
sweat pants. 
</P>
<P>
 They're so comfortable, fans say, that other shoes lose their appeal. "Once I 
started wearing rubber soles, I never wanted to go back to my cowboy boots and 
Doc Martens because my feet would ache all the time," Baruch says. 
</P>
<P>
 The commando boot is a fashion that, militaristically speaking, followed 
function. It was created in 1947 by Palladium, a French company that originally 
made rubber tires and gloves, and was first worn by French Foreign Legion 
soldiers stationed in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Palladium continued to make the boots for the military and eventually adapted 
the design for the junior fashion market in the early '80s. A hit in Europe for 
some time, designers have been trotting out the boot each fall for four years, 
but it caught on here only last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't give it away for a while, but it's a trend that is reaching a 
peak now and all the designers going after it," says Dana Taryn, editor for the 
Tobe Report, a New York-based trend-watching publication. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of a utilitarian, durable couture that guys and girls have been 
going back to, with overalls, khakis, chinos, dickeys and construction worker 
jackets," Taryn explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Palladium, one of the pricier labels on the market at about $90 to $100, 
claims to have perfected the science of vulcanizing (baking) the 
injection-molded sole onto the canvas top. But Guess, JCPenney, Nine West, Keds 
(for children) and many other companies are pumping out their impressions of 
the desert commando boot and shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing favoritism of indestructible, utilitarian boots among teen-agers and 
twentysomethings in part inspired the creation of Guess Athletic, a licensee of 
Guess started by ex-Nike executives two years ago. Its "Flatrock" for men and 
"Dakota" for women ($40-$50) have been bestsellers in the line of rugged shoes 
and boots. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go with everything and you can put on as many socks as you like with 
these because there is so much room in them," says Jean Parker, an 18-year-old 
college student spotted recently in black-on-black Dakotas with white cotton 
sport socks, denim short shorts and an oversize sweat shirt. "They are so 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the canvas commandos' commercial success, they are not for the 
faint of foot -- or ego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wear them with dresses at work (in a medical office) and they laugh at me," 
says Diane Chabot, 24, of her off-white low-tops.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, she says, "I want to get another pair in white. What can I say? I 
followed the trend. The goofier the look and the more clashing it is, is what's 
vogue. It's scary."

 If Bill Ryan had to come up with a word to describe his taste in home decor, 
it would be Contemporientique.  
</P>
<P>
 The ocean-view Dana Point townhouse he shares with girlfriend Briget Barr is 
filled with a surprisingly well-balanced and uncluttered combination of 
contemporary leather and canvas furniture, Victorian antiques and Chinese 
lacquered pieces, including a chest nabbed for $200 and an end table for $100 
at a consignment shop. 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy on the East Coast, Ryan would comb the city dump for "buried 
treasure." Now, the former IBM financing specialist believes the secret to 
finding valuable, one-of-a-kind collectibles is shopping the secondhand stores 
in wealthier or artsy areas, such as Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the best deal, he advises, learn to haggle over price without being 
obnoxious. The dealers respect that. "It's a matter of pride to negotiate 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan also hits garage sales, retail liquidations and the "scratch and dent" 
departments of such chain stores as Ikea and Pier I Imports, where he bought a 
tortoise stool. (Sandpaper and a little paint can undo almost any damage, he 
says.) He picked up a pair of discontinued dining chairs, priced at $55 each at 
Bif Korea, to flank the Chinese chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr tolerates the constant quest for deals, even finds it amusing -- up to a 
point. When she finally moved West last year after a prolonged bicoastal 
relationship, she knew there would be little room in the house for her 
furniture. But she didn't expect Ryan to pick her up at the airport in a car 
crammed so full with garage-sale goodies -- scored along the drive -- that 
there was barely enough space for her. Sources

FASHION / CAFE SOCIETY: TRUE BLUE (AND WHITE) DODGER FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE SEIPP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Place: Dodger Stadium, 1000 Elysian Park Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 
224-1400. 
</P>
<P>
 Atmosphere: A mixture of rabid Dodgers fans and people who think going to a 
baseball game is no different than going to the park with your friends. 
Constantly moving food hawkers yell "Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs!" over 
intermittent deafening crowd cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving Up Style: Male ticket takers sport straw boaters with blue "Dodgers" 
hat bands, crisp white shirts and navy-blue ties; food servers wear blue visors 
that match blue aprons and blue-and-white pin-striped shirts. The young women 
who say "Your seat is over there" do so in blue-and-white miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer Themes: The Dodger colors, everywhere. Children and infants turn out 
in blue-and-white jumpsuits or sleepers worn with matching blue or white bows, 
socks and shoes. For old men, it's white squashy rain hats and dark blue parkas 
over light-blue shirts, navy pants and white Wallabees. Women wear bra tops or 
tank tops with coordinating shorts, flip-flops and sometimes, yes, blue socks. 
Young male hunks favor T-shirts tucked into shorts; for non-hunks, it's 
T-shirts adorned with sentiments about beer and women pulled over beer bellies. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair Apparent: Women pull their ponytails or braids through the tops of visors 
or smash them under baseball caps. For the young male hunks, closely shaved dos 
encircled by bandannas. All others: sweat-matted and, of course, worn under 
caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories: Fanny packs with "pack" worn over the stomach, binoculars, 
parasols, sunglasses with leashes, sunburned shoulders, Walkman headsets, 
programs in back pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Rule: When thou triest to find thy car in the sprawling, impossibly 
large stadium parking lot, thou shalt wander hopelessly in the hot sun for 
almost an hour, eventually imagining that thou seest mirages and bleached cow 
skulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "Bunnnnnns? Bunnnnnns?"; "Nuts! Nuts! Nuts!"; "Pepp-uh-roni pizza! 
Pepp-uh-roni pizza!"; "Don't walk so fast, I can't keep up with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Original Headgear: Apparently lacking the requisite baseball cap, a young 
male hunk fashioned a unique hat/sun deflector out of a cardboard food-carting 
tray. 
</P>
<P>
 Parting Statement: "Soda, everybody, buy your soda now! They're full of ice 
now. You can't beat that, now. Take your pick, now. I don't care, now. I have 
no lines, now. I represent fast food, now." MICHELE SEIPP

 Tonight, while we're watching "Mystery" to tap into our higher self, John 
Bartlett will be fitting Ali MacGraw and company for an upcoming yoga video. 
What's the connection between the young, avant-garde menswear designer and the 
lotus position? It seems that MacGraw, a longtime yoga devotee, was in the 
audience at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards in New York a 
few months ago and saw a short film Bartlett produced for the occasion 
involving yoga. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd been looking for a director for her yoga video and hired Claudio 
Droguett, the guy who directed my film, to direct hers," said Bartlett. "She 
trusted me to design things that wouldn't look like L.A. exercise clothes." And 
that would be? "Fitted tight tops with loose pajama bottoms or oversize tops 
with leggings -- so that each outfit has that tension to it." Because the video 
will be shot in White Sands, N.M., Bartlett used fabric in shades of blue and 
white, "to go with the sky and the sand." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Bartlett will be part of the crowd at The Temple's second 
annual Skirt Party in West L.A., which includes a fashion show of his and other 
local designers' skirts. Skirt-wearing guys are more common in New York than 
L.A., he said, but Bartlett's oversized caftan sold out completely at Neiman 
Marcus in Beverly Hills this season. "I wish they'd bought more," he said with 
a sigh.

 Making New Money Look Old: Calvin Klein's pretty wife Kelly dropped by the 
Montana Avenue vintage clothing store Elizabeth Lucas the other day via 
chauffeur-driven limousine. When another shopper admired her diamond eternity 
band -- the one Calvin bought from the estate of the late Duchess of Windsor 
for a reported $103,000 -- Klein took the ring off and let the woman try it on. 
(We guess even an eternity ring needs a break.)

 Klein left the store with three pieces from Lucas' flawless stock: a long, 
cotton frock in a tiny floral print with a gathered bodice from the '40s; a 
white tea gown in cotton batiste from the '30s; and a black lace-and-chiffon 
evening gown, also from the '30s. Oh, and her wedding ring.

 To Us, She'll Always be Madison the Mermaid: Daryl Hannah may have only been 
50 feet tall in her last film ("Attack of the 50-Foot Woman"), but in designer 
Karl Lagerfeld's eyes, she looms even larger. "Daryl Hannah, for me, is a woman 
who has the look, the attitude and the way to move in life," said Lagerfeld, 
describing the woman he's hired to pitch his new fragrance, Sun Moon Stars. 
"She is what I think the complete woman of the late 20th Century could be, 
should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerfeld said he fell in love with Hannah's "ethereal" beauty when she 
appeared on the December cover of Harper's Bazaar. We were more taken with 
Helmut Newton's wicked shot of the young actress in Vanity Fair a few years 
back. There she was, in full starlet regalia -- pouty red lips, bikini, 
stiletto heels -- holding, no, balancing a tiny baby on her arms. A complete 
woman of the late 20th Century.

 Take Our Money -- Please: Buying a gift certificate for $25 at Express should 
be fairly simple -- or so we thought, until actually attempting such a 
transaction. Before acknowledging our presence, the salesclerk had to fortify 
herself with a piece of gum, chit-chatting with a gum-supplying colleague. 
Then: 
</P>
<P>
 "A gift certificate, huh?" she asked, between chomps. "Nancy! Nancy! Do you 
know how to do a gift certificate?? 
</P>
<P>
 "You wanted a gift certificate, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, they kinda just walked away. Where are they? 
</P>
<P>
 "Joyce! Joyce! Do you have the key to the drawer where the gift certificates 
are?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a gift certificate, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Right. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was cash, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Right. Mission accomplished, we asked Miss Chewing Gum if the certificate 
could be used at other locations. "Of course!" she chirped, with so much 
confidence we had to wonder if she were just playing dumb before. Nah . . .

 Armani A/X Changes Hands: Simint Spa, an Italian clothing company controlled 
by designer Giorgio Armani, announced this week that it has sold Armani A/X, 
its money-losing U.S. retailing chain to Singapore-based group Ong Beng Seng as 
part of a restructuring. A/X had been touted by Simint as its main money-earner 
in the years ahead, but required heavy investments to start and is still losing 
money, according to Bloomberg news service. It was Simint's first venture into 
retailing. There are 41 A/X stores in the United States.

 Trendless in Los Angeles: The other day, a Newsweek editor left a message on 
our voice mail. It seems the magazine was intrigued with a couple of fashion 
curiosities we'd written about. But by the time we called back, we were told 
that one of the trends -- teens tying their sneakers upside-down -- was old 
news. "Several bureaus," she said in all seriousness, "confirmed it." Oh.

IMAGE THERAPIST USES THE MIND'S EYE TO HEAL THE BODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD BONHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting beside a patient during a dream session, Marielle Fuller sometimes 
folds her torso forward abruptly, her head nearly touching her knees, and then 
snaps back upright. It is a quirk not of old age -- Fuller is 85 -- but of 
fervor for her work and, one gathers, of empathy for her clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The movements punctuate Fuller's comments but do not distract her patients, 
whose eyes are always closed and whose thoughts are far afield. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's patient, 36-year-old Susan Tibbetts of Laguna Beach, pulls off a pair 
of Western boots and settles back on the couch. In the next 15 minutes, Fuller 
will use guided image therapy to take Tibbetts into a soothing mental landscape 
of potentially healing images. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unconscious is seen by the conscious in terms of images," Fuller 
explains, "and through accessing the unconscious we reach the higher self. The 
self is the best healer." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her age, it has been just nine months since Fuller retired from UCLA's 
Neuropsychiatric Institute as a lecturer in psychiatry. During her 33-year 
career, she trained more than 400 psychiatry residents in guided imagery 
techniques and lectured assembled therapists in London, Paris, Florence and 
throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its name has a New Age ring, guided imagery has roots in ancient 
healing disciplines. A cousin of hypnotherapy, it is based on the principle 
that bodily responses are linked to the patient's unconscious interpretation of 
mental stimuli. 
</P>
<P>
 In dreamlike therapy sessions, the stimuli take the form of images, archetypes 
and symbols that are spontaneously offered by the patient's unconscious. These 
images, Fuller says, serve both as metaphors that help the patient understand 
the disease process and as emotional triggers to the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because tests have proved imaging's ability to affect blood pressure, 
heart rate and other body responses, the technique has gained increased 
credibility among medical doctors for pain management. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, who for years saw at least 20 private patients a week, has quit the 
lecture circuit but has no plans to retire from therapy. Since February she has 
shared her expertise as the oldest of the 150 volunteers at Laguna Shanti, an 
AIDS service group in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller had planned to retire in Laguna ever since she and her husband 
vacationed there in the 1950s and '60s. She relishes the slower pace outside 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked six days a week until I was 84 1/2, and now I need time for my own 
inner life," she said. "I just love the beauty here, and it's to be my final 
home. I am a very private person, and I don't need many people." 
</P>
<P>
 When she arrived in Laguna, she realized that her skills could still prove 
useful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there would be a lot of HIV-positive people here, and I'd heard about 
Shanti and asked if I could do workshops. I had worked with people with 
Parkinson's disease, colitis and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in competition with doctors; I'm only an adjunct to taking care of a 
patient. Imagery can prepare them to die in a very different place because it 
helps them discover their own spirituality. They have strength and power to 
control the pain and live a richer life than if they weren't doing imagery." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, says Sarah Kasman of Shanti, the workshops have been well received. 
</P>
<P>
 "With AIDS, alternative therapies are very significant, and the people have 
really loved it," Kasman said. "Many people with life-threatening illnesses 
lose their sense of self and feel powerless. Imagery can bring some of that 
power back to them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because it is a rainy day, Tibbetts is the only person who has shown 
up at Fuller's weekly session at Shanti. Or maybe, Fuller says, the low turnout 
is to be expected after last week's session, an emotional freight train for the 
half-dozen AIDS patients and mourning partners of AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
 A common mistake among imagery therapists, according to Fuller, is directing 
patients to pleasant scenes rather than letting the unconscious confront and 
overcome obstacles naturally, which Fuller says leads to longer-term healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People cry and get very sad, but that's where they are," she says. "Sometimes 
the archetypal figure in the dream will say, 'Your tears are OK. Let's water 
the ground with them and maybe something will grow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tibbetts, who is HIV-positive, has requested an image session before she moves 
out of state. Fuller leans forward earnestly and begins to lay the dream's 
groundwork. Her voice has a practiced cadence and a low register that 
nonetheless manages to maintain its freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are walking on a path in a forest. A lovely wide path, very smooth, very 
comfortable." Fuller, rocking forward, waits for the peaceful scene to be set. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will come to a stream, and the stream has formed a pool. You will get in 
it, because it's a healing pool. Feel it; look up at the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes in the pool, Tibbetts says that some animals, including a 
fawn, have come to drink from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deer in imagery is a very spiritual animal, and he may want to show you 
something," Fuller says. "You will follow the deer and see what he wants to 
show you. We'll come back to the pool after." 
</P>
<P>
 Where the fawn takes Tibbetts is a barbed-wire fence, in which another deer is 
entangled. Tibbetts frees the animal. A few minutes later, after the therapy 
has ended, she agrees that the sequence's obvious symbolism -- spiritual 
development running into obstacles -- rings true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm spiritual, but (having HIV) it's been a struggle," Tibbetts said. "I 
think, 'Why me? Am I not good enough?' But what the dream told me is that I can 
overcome that. The session was very centering, very empowering. Other leaders 
describe the entire scene, but she allowed me to use more imagination myself. I 
could feel her energy." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Fuller, born in Montreal in 1909, recalls her mother as being domineering yet 
fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was queen of the house. My father was a wonderful man, but my sister and 
I didn't get very close to him -- my mother wouldn't allow it," Fuller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing the Montreal schools to be mediocre, her mother taught Fuller until 
she was 10, and Fuller earned her high-school diploma through tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think keeping me out of school was a good idea, because I was very 
lonely," Fuller says. "But I learned to be alone then, and it helps now because 
I've been alone now for 27 years since my husband died." 
</P>
<P>
 She married Victor Fuller, an Englishman, in 1934 and moved to Toronto five 
years later. She took night journalism classes at the University of Toronto and 
wrote occasional book reviews for the Toronto Globe and Mail. Because of her 
trouble with arthritis, the couple moved to the warmer climes of California in 
1952. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller became a West Coast pioneer in imaging techniques in part because of 
her ability to read the original French texts of Robert Desoille, a mechanical 
engineer who was an imagery theorist in Paris in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time it wasn't really done here, but she had the creativity to be 
able to integrate (European) ideas and come up with her own way of using guided 
imagery," said David S. Gordon, a colleague of Fuller at UCLA for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 During her years at UCLA, Fuller helped conduct drug experiments, worked with 
suicidal patients and treated hundreds of clients suffering from anxiety, 
depression or low self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual aspect of her university life was that, although she worked daily 
among colleagues who have multiple academic degrees, she lacks any sort of 
college credential. For this reason, she said, administrators would 
occasionally ask her to lie low while visiting VIPs made the rounds. "I said, 
'No, I won't,' " she recalls. "They didn't know how to explain me, but they 
always trusted me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, colleagues say it was just this spunk, as well as her innate skills as 
a therapist, that kept her afloat in the sea of degreed psychiatrists, 
clinicians and psychoanalysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a great ability to use psychiatrists, who were clinically trained, as 
a sounding board, to fill in gaps in her own education," said Gordon, who has 
taken over Fuller's weekly seminars at UCLA. "It's unusual (for a worker 
without a degree) to have the status and respect that she had throughout the 
institute, not just among the residents but among faculty and staff. She 
developed a large and fond following." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who trained with Fuller is Dr. Bernard Towers, a Beverly Hills 
physician who uses imagery to help patients with cancer and heart disease 
understand the body's healing processes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marielle has an absolutely remarkable clinical sense. She empathizes with 
every person she works with and can get inside their skin and see their 
situation. This is the hallmark of all good therapists," said Towers, a 
professor emeritus of anatomy and psychiatry at UCLA and former director of 
medicine at Cambridge University in England. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does not have the Ph.Ds and MDs and all those tickets of admission to 
academia, but the fact is that, like many pioneers in the world's history, she 
is a pioneer because she has insight and is so skilled," Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Fawzy I. Fawzy, deputy director of the Neuropsychiatric Institute, praised 
Fuller's work and said that other adjunct lecturers at the institute have 
lacked psychology degrees, including the late Norman Cousins, a journalist who 
wrote on the role of mental attitude in healing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller's skills were especially put to the test on the occasions she addressed 
convention halls packed with skeptical members of psychiatric associations. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one lecture in Los Angeles I got up to the podium and said, 'Standing here 
I'm reminded of Daniel going into the lion's den, but I don't really see anyone 
here who's going to eat me,' " she said. "That broke the ice . . . and some of 
them later referred patients to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the living room of her rented home in northern Laguna, Fuller sits close to 
a picture window, where she nods now and again at the zinnias she has planted 
in her front yard. Flowers color her back patio too, planted, perhaps, to spite 
the brush fires that threatened her home in October. In her study, which 
doubles as a treatment room for Shanti patients, three bookcases contain dozens 
of the arcane psychology titles one would expect to find in the office of a 
renowned therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because my education has been very much my own doing, reading is very, very 
important to me," Fuller says. "But even that is getting harder now, with age." 
</P>
<P>
 The maladies of the elderly, which have begun to slow Fuller, led to her 
retirement from UCLA. Because of cataracts, she must use a magnifier to read, 
and she says large-type books are a blessing. To get around town she depends on 
her 52-year-old daughter, Monica ("my seeing-eye daughter"), and on friends who 
drive from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, a mother of two, has lately been indulging her fondness for gardening, 
music and reading as she has adjusted to a far more anonymous life than she had 
in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning it was frustrating not being as well-known in Laguna as I 
was in Los Angeles," she said. "I even had a dream about it. I dreamed that my 
purse and my wallet (were) stolen, and all my identification cards were in the 
wallet. No one could know who I was -- meaning my identity was nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Another frustration to Fuller is that, in part because no license is needed to 
do image therapy, many practitioners have only a marginal understanding of 
symbols and their importance in interpreting the unconscious mind. She is 
collaborating with Toby Klasser-Rothman, an Encino psychotherapist, on a book 
that details the role of symbols in imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to any approach to imagery, however, is the principle that the body 
has built-in mechanisms for healing. To Fuller it is an axiom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't get in touch with is psychic energy," she says. "There's so 
much of it in the universe that we never call on. It's not magical but just 
getting in touch with your own power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patient," she says, "is the best doctor."

BOOK REVIEW / SHORT STORIES; QUIRKY COLLECTION OF BLEAK LIVES FEELS JUST TOO 
CONTRIVED; MOSES SUPPOSES BY ELLEN CURRIE ; SIMON & SCHUSTER; $20, 219 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bubbles in "Moses Supposes" signal champagne, or someone drowning, or 
perhaps someone drowning in champagne. Whether it is a divorced couple nuzzling 
at their broken marriage after a child's trouble brings them together, or a 
suffering teen-ager neglected by her rich parents, or a man helplessly trying 
to cope with his aged, destructive parents, the despair is voiced for rueful 
wit.  
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Currie, author of "Available Light," wears her rue with a certain 
sameness. Most of the figures in these short stories are third- or 
fourth-generation Irish American, but a number have spent time in Salingerland. 
Drastic pain swims beneath the jauntiness. Extremities are costumed in kooky 
repartee. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a certain staginess even in the better pieces; they are not stories 
so much as narrative performances. Currie's characters tap-dance on their 
griddle; too often it seems as if the griddle was there to produce the tap. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Whatever You Say, Say Nothing," Baby is in the hospital, having given 
birth by Cesarean to a boy. Malachy, her husband, comes in to tell her he'd 
expected her to die so he could go off with Andy "and live happily ever after." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy, she assumes, is his nickname for her best friend, Andrea; by the end, it 
turns out to be worse than that. But she retorts zingily: "So what's Plan B?" 
And when he says he has no feelings for the baby, she explains it's like a 
blind date: The feeling is supposed to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Malachy is just the first of the doleful bubbles. Baby's mother gets into a 
comically tearful exchange after an innocent remark about the baby's looks. 
Andrea admits to going out with Malachy ("We lied. It's the only efficient 
way").  
</P>
<P>
 Her father arrives with her mentally unbalanced brother. Another brother, a 
priest who studied in Rome and was brilliant in theology, is now interested 
only in talking about his dogs. Four sisters arrive, each with troubles and 
repartee. Her mother-in-law complains about the Cesarean: "lazy muscles." The 
talk is dark humor, but the multiple darknesses of the situation seem excessive 
and contrived. 
</P>
<P>
 So they do in the middle-aged plight of Griffith, depressed and flaccid, in 
"Yesterday's Lilies, Dollar a Stem. An Epsilon." His two aged parents live 
together and hate each other. His father used to beat his mother; now, being 
too feeble, he makes periodic threats to commit suicide. His mother 
compulsively scrubs the floor in an old party dress, buys day-old lilies to 
save money and preempts her husband with an abortive effort to hang herself in 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 She ends up in the hospital, he ends up in jail for hitting a policeman, and 
Griffith ends up in a fit of giggles after breaking a branch in his own 
half-hearted effort to hang himself. Currie gets the blankness, the gallows 
humor, the bitterness of age and harsh memory. But she has placed them on a 
contrivance that strains for belief. 
</P>
<P>
 A situation so extreme as to seem self-conscious weakens though it doesn't 
quite tear the lovely fabric of "Slim Young Woman in No Distress." The 
conversation between Bravo, a preternaturally verbal child, and his mother, 
Glover, is quirky, comic and disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bit by bit we learn that Glover's divorced husband, a brilliant doctor whom 
the child worships, has lost his mind. His grandmother, with whom he lives part 
of the time, reads him from "A Child's Book of Divorce." She also reads from "A 
Child's Book of Death." Glover, an illustrator, is dying of cancer. Bravo -- we 
imagine a Salinger child illustrated by Sendak -- is in danger. Currie writes 
it beautifully but to excess, like a cook who uses every spice on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Salingerian poignancy, without a corresponding ability to make the character 
alluring, overtakes two stories about what might be called poor little rich 
girls.  
</P>
<P>
 In one, an adolescent whose parents are too busy and selfish to have time for 
her, is laid up with the flu over a boarding school holiday. An old caretaker 
lifts her spirits with poetry and a reminiscence of her mother's own young 
wildness. 
</P>
<P>
 In the title story, an 18-year-old, discovering she's pregnant, goes into a 
winsome but not really interesting funk and is soothed by her comedic and 
infinitely indulgent young husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Two stories stand out in the collection. Both are about middle-aged marriages; 
both bend Currie's charm and emotional effervescence to a graver service. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Solution to Canned Peas," a man visits his divorced wife to discuss 
some alarming symptoms shown by the youngest of their four daughters. An affair 
he had had still rankles, but in an evening of companionship, both the love and 
the pain of the past are wittily and movingly evoked. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Exit Interview" an aging and fading advertising executive balances his 
attraction to his fierce and funny young assistant, who loves him painfully, 
with loyalty to a wife who is dying of cancer. Currie transforms the choice to 
larger questions of loyalty -- to life itself, to frailty and to the passing of 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a certain staginess even in the better pieces; they are not stories 
so much as narrative performances.

understand their culture.The one chosen to be princess will represent the Full 
Moons Powwow at other powwows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Four Moons Powwow also includes singing, storytelling, contests and 
intertribal dancing, food and crafts on all three days. Miss Full Moons Powwow 
contest is 6-9 p.m. On Saturday, representatives of Apache, Navajo, Cahuilla 
and other tribes will participate in the Fontana Days Parade.  
</P>
<P>
 The parade will be followed by gourd dancing (a dance in honor of veterans) 
from noon-2 p.m. The grand entry at 2 p.m. features Native Americans in 
traditional regalia performing the flag dance in the arena, along with singing 
and an opening prayer. At 5:30 p.m., the Native American of the Year will be 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, gourd dancing will be held at noon, a grand entry at 1 p.m. The

8,200 ATTEND EVANGELISM CRUSADE; RELIGION: IT'S THE FIRST SUCH EVENT HELD IN 
THE VALLEY. AN ARGENTINE-BORN PREACHER AND ENTERTAINER PAT BOONE ADDRESS 
BIRMINGHAM HIGH CROWD.

<P>
 The five-day Luis Palau crusade, the first mass evangelism event ever held in 
the San Fernando Valley, began Wednesday night with an estimated 8,200 people 
listening to the Argentine-born evangelist preach a message of divine 
forgiveness -- accompanied by an unscheduled lesson in nature's power. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3.7 magnitude aftershock from the Jan. 17 Northridge quake caused a 
commotion in the crowd, sitting in bleachers and on chairs and blankets at 
Birmingham High School's Tom Bradley Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock was felt just after the prayers for donations and just before 
ushers began distributing buckets for the offerings. "A little message there 
from the Lord," quipped one Palau aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see how insecure this world is," said Palau as he began his sermon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a campaign to make us more religious, it's a campaign to give us 
a personal relationship to Jesus Christ," Palau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau was not the only preacher, as it turned out. Before he appeared, 
entertainer Pat Boone, honorary co-chairman of the crusade, addressed the 
crowd. He referred to his appearance in the lead role of "Will Rogers' Follies" 
in Branson, the little Missouri town that has become a country music 
entertainment capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I'm playing a man who said 'I never met a man I didn't like,' " Boone 
said, "I serve a God who never created a person he didn't love." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the message of God," Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd helped Boone celebrate his 60th birthday by singing "Happy 
Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the happiest birthdays I've ever had," Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone, who appeared in a white suit, was famous for his clean-cut, white-shoes 
image during the 1950s and 1960s when his records and movies were popular. 
</P>
<P>
 But U. S. evangelical and charismatic Christians also remember Boone as one of 
the few celebrities who spoke openly of his beliefs and lent his name to 
Christian causes in the 1970s when evangelical churches started to emerge from 
a self-imposed silence on social and political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The crusade, which will conclude with a 4 p.m. Sunday rally, has other 
Christian entertainers appearing as guests other nights, including Motown 
singer Smokey Robinson tonight.) 
</P>
<P>
 Business executive Lawrence Hoke, executive chairman of the crusade, said in 
introducing Palau that the globe-trotting evangelist was a man who "comes with 
a lively sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Palau began his remarks with a long joke about a black Christian and a 
white Christian arguing at length about whether God was black or white. The two 
Christians were still arguing when they had a fatal automobile crash, Palau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men, Palau said, were still at it as they approached the pearly gates 
and Saint Peter. They finally had the argument settled when God approached them 
with the greeting: "Buenos dias, senores." 
</P>
<P>
 Warned Palaujokingly: "You Anglos better learn Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of 50 San Fernando Valley area pastors, led by the large Church on the 
Way in Van Nuys, invited Palau nearly two years ago to conduct the crusade. 
More than 200 congregations and religious ministries have since pledged 
financial and volunteer support. 
</P>
<P>
 A crusade official said just before the crusade's start that contributions 
have risen to just under $300,000, about 75% of the budget, much of which went 
for the hundreds of signs, posters and ads calling attention to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau, 59, has preached to more than 10 million people in Latin America, 
Poland, Romania, Russia and other countries -- and increasingly in the United 
States. As Billy Graham, slowed by age and Parkinson's disease, has reduced his 
crusade schedule in recent years, the Palau team has received more invitations 
to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau's international evangelistic association is based in Portland, Ore., 
where he attended studies at a Bible college, then met his wife and became an 
American citizen in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 An associate evangelist, Dan Owens, announced to the crowd that he was 
required to read a statement from the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
Board of Education. The message, in effect, was a separation of church and 
state disclaimer. The message made it clear that while the board rented the 
crusade space on the school grounds, the board was not sponsoring it and does 
not endorse any statements or opinions made there.

MOTHER AND SON BARELY ESCAPE AS TRAIN HITS JEEP; ACCIDENT: THE VEHICLE STALLED 
AT A CROSSING. THE WOMAN AND YOUTH ARE BADLY SHAKEN AFTER THE FIERY CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A mother and her 12-year-old son narrowly escaped death Wednesday morning when 
their vehicle stalled at a railroad crossing and was struck by a Metrolink 
train, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stella Reyes, 42, and her son, Gabriel, both of Pacoima, escaped injury but 
were badly shaken by the accident, which occurred as she was driving her son to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Jeep Cherokee was crushed and tossed more than 50 feet down the track 
and then burst into flames. Heat from the fire could be felt inside the train, 
Metrolink passengers said . 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a mid-size car running over a soda can," Metrolink spokesman 
Peter Hidalgo said. "Everyone is very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 The train, headed from Lancaster to Downtown Los Angeles with about 200 
passengers, was delayed about 45 minutes, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened about 7:50 a.m. as Reyes was driving with her son along 
San Fernando Road. The Jeep stalled on a stretch of tracks at the intersection 
of San Fernando Road and Osborne Street, police and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeatedly trying to restart the vehicle, Reyes looked up and saw the 
train barreling toward her, police said. She yelled at her son to get out, but 
continued trying to start it. Finally, she jumped out just before the 100-ton 
train hit her car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineer told police he had applied his air brakes after he realized the 
vehicle was apparently stuck on the tracks. The train was traveling 79 m.p.h. 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he saw the car stopped on the tracks about a quarter of a mile away 
and beeped his horn several times," said Officer Norman Nagengast of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. "He saw a woman get out 
right before impact." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Metrolink commuters, there was little warning. Some screamed because 
they thought the train was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize we hit anything, and all of a sudden this flame engulfed the 
side of the train," said Sheryl Jones, a Santa Clarita resident who works as a 
legal assistant downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said passengers in her Metrolink car started screaming. "We were scared, 
we wanted out," she said. "We thought something malfunctioned on the train." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few looked around when the engineer applied the air brakes, most 
were startled awake or looked up from their books to see the right side of the 
commuter train pass through what one passenger described as "12-foot flames." 
Those sitting on that side felt intense heat, and some windows were singed. 
</P>
<P>
 Luz Paiz of Lancaster, who was taking the train for the first time to her job 
at an appliance store in Glendale, was dozing, then found herself looking at 
the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a hit, I heard a hit. That startled me," Paiz said. "What woke me up 
was the intense heat on the glass." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Jordan, who works at a downtown garment manufacturer, was sitting across 
from Paiz, on the left side of the train, when she saw something that looked 
like a spare tire for a Jeep, with the brackets, go flying by her window -- the 
car part apparently sheered away by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan was talking on a cellular phone to a work colleague at the time, and 
she looked to her right to see the flames. "I went, 'Oh my gosh! I think we 
just hit a car!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Perez of Arleta -- who takes the train from Sylmar to Union Station, 
where he catches another Metrolink to his job as a mechanical engineer in 
Upland -- was sitting behind Paiz and jumped into the aisle to avoid the fire 
and heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the train was on fire because the flames kept on coming," he said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; FAIRY TALE TRIAL MAKES CASE FOR LEGAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a case worthy of "L.A. Law: The Next Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at the defense table was a nervous-looking Jack Spratt -- eater of no 
fat and famed for his adventures with a handful of magical legumes and a 
towering beanstalk. 
</P>
<P>
 At the prosecutor's table was the victim -- Morris Atlas, the Giant. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges were serious: attempted murder of the Giant and theft of Goldie, 
the goose, which in a '90s twist forgoes golden eggs in favor of 
cholesterol-lowering ones. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few hours Wednesday, the auditorium of Laurence 2000 Private Elementary 
School in Van Nuys was scene to a class project come to life. The Kids Court 
class, taught by teacher and lawyer Lauren Jacobson Wolke every Friday, 
scripted and acted out a fairy tale trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The class teaches them both creative and critical thinking," said Wolke, who 
has been teaching Kids Court for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kids Court participants got a real taste of the workings of the legal 
system, as Federal District Court Magistrate Stephen Hillman, a parent of one 
of the kids at Laurence 2000, selected the members of the jury for the trial. 
The jury had not been involved in preparing the case and was asked to determine 
Jack Spratt's fate, the only part of the case that was not scripted. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama unfolded with witness "Arnold Ziffle" -- an egg expert portrayed by 
10-year-old Jordan Kramer, who demonstrated how Goldie's cholesterol-lowering 
eggs differed from normal eggs. When put in water, the normal egg sunk, while 
the cholesterol-lowering eggs floated. 
</P>
<P>
 The eggs in question had brought the giant a fortune of roughly $200 million 
(Mr. Atlas wasn't sure on that figure; he needed to check with his accountant). 
</P>
<P>
 Jack's defense was complicated. He maintained the goose was genetically 
engineered by his late father and then stolen by the Giant. He had only stolen 
back what was rightfully his, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Giant falling from the beanstalk -- clearly self-defense, argued 
Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 After minutes and minutes of deliberations, the jury returned to the court to 
present its findings. It was a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
 While that was an unsatisfactory decision for some, the project has left its 
mark on the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecuting attorney, 11-year-old Bradley Dickter, has decided he wants to 
practice law when he grows up. Dickter attributes this to the experience of 
playing Peter Pan in last year's trial: the case of the County of Neverland vs. 
Peter Pan. He was found guilty (wrongfully, he insists) of the murder of 
Captain Hook. He has since vowed, "I'm going to be a district attorney to fight 
injustice." MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BUS ROUTES CANCELED DUE TO LOW RIDERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two routes on Glendale's Beeline bus system have been canceled due to low 
ridership, the city announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses on Route 3, which serves the Glendale Adventist Medical Center, will 
cease operating after Friday.Route 5 buses, which cover the Montrose area, will 
cease running after Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to the Glendale Beeline last November as part of a major expansion to 
the system, the two routes have lured few riders, city officials said. A 
six-month evaluation -- studying the effectiveness and efficiency of the routes 
based on an average of 20 passengers per hour -- was just completed. Route 3, 
which runs on Chevy Chase Drive from Garfield Avenue to the Glendale Adventist 
Medical Center, averaged only six boardings an hour. Route 5, running from 
Verdugo Hills Hospital, along Honolulu Avenue, to Pennsylvania Avenue, averaged 
two boardings an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two Beeline routes will discontinue, the same destinations can be 
reached by taking Metropolitan Transit Authority buses. The MTA can be reached 
at (818) 246-2593 for more information. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beeline buses used for the discontinued routes will be put into service on 
the remaining lines, 1, 2 and 4, which all exceeded 20 boardings per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares for Beeline buses are 25 cents for a one-way ride, 15 cents for the 
disabled and those 60 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on Beeline service, call (818) 548-3960. ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; WORKSHOP SCHEDULED ON SEPTIC DUMP PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to angry demonstrations organized by neighbors and 
environmentalists in recent weeks, the vice president of the Los Angeles Board 
of Public Works has intervened and scheduled a workshop on a proposed septic 
waste dump in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to the meeting, which will take place from 7 to 9:30 
p.m. today at the Balboa Sports Center, 17015 Burbank Blvd., Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 20 letter to area residents who have attended past meetings on the 
dump, J.P. Ellman referred to an open house at the recreation area, when more 
than 100 pickets protested the proposed facility and criticized public works 
staff and consultants as unresponsive and insincere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have since received communications from individuals who feel that the 
public is not being included in the environmental process, particularly in the 
selection of sites that will be analyzed in the (environmental impact report)," 
the letter reads.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am greatly concerned about this and, as a result, I have instructed staff 
to hold another community workshop on the alternative sites under 
consideration," the letter reads. 
</P>
<P>
 Criteria used by staff to pare down a list of 70 alternative sites to 21 sites 
"was not fully explained to the public" at the last workshop, Ellman said in an 
interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Staff was going to explain the criteria, Ellman said, but was not able to 
because of the demonstration.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, all media inquiries have been directed to the commissioner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual that a commissioner gets that involved in a particular issue 
if it gets controversial or complicated," Ellman explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is conducting an environmental study on the nearly completed 
$2-million facility, which is situated within an existing water treatment 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump would be used as a central collection point for septic tank waste, 
trucked in from the San Fernando Valley and neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The waste would then be piped out to the Hyperion Treatment Plant in Playa Del 
Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by neighbors and environmentalists, the City Council voted last 
November to delay for one year approval of the facility, while the study is 
being completed. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; STUDENTS RECEIVE QUAKE DONATIONS

<P>
 Most remember the images: children living in Red Cross shelters, accepting 
donations of sweaters and sandwiches, clinging to parents in the tent cities 
erected after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Touched by the images, groups ranging from California counselors to Kansas 
quilters sent donations to the Los Angeles Unified School District for the 
children, once they returned to school and home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, starting at an East Valley school, the district began handing 
out backpacks filled with books, crayons and games to the children who know the 
feel of a regulation cot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Maria Rincon, 5, clung tightly to her mother when her name was called in 
the auditorium at Langdon Avenue Elementary School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go on," her mother urged in Spanish. The audience was small -- only a dozen 
students sitting in the front row also waiting for their backpacks -- but Ana 
Maria remained shy. 
</P>
<P>
 She grasped the hot pink-colored bag with her name taped on the front and 
rushed back to her mother, Rogelia Rincon, who spent 15 days in a shelter with 
Ana Maria and her other child, a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Joann Zgonc, LAUSD's project coordinator for homeless children, said the 
district knew of 422 youngsters who spent time in the emergency shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means there were probably many more we didn't know about," she told the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Zgonc said the backpacks included a flashlight and a personal care kit, should 
the students ever need them in case of another emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of us learned after the earthquake that we need to prepare a 
little better," said Zgonc, who will take backpacks to 19 other schools 
throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Balderrama, principal of Langdon, said about 25 students from the school 
that serves 1,500 students spent time at shelters. Only 14 of those students 
returned, he said. Others moved to other schools within the district or moved 
from the area, Zgonc said. REBECCA BRYANT

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; POST-QUAKE PARKING RULES ARE TIGHTENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parking officials will start ticketing cars this week on streets surrounding 
the Civic Center where motorists were allowed to ignore parking rules after the 
Northridge earthquake damaged downtown parking structures. 
</P>
<P>
 People parking on several downtown-area streets from Jan. 17 through Wednesday 
were allowed to remain in spaces beyond the allotted time and were not 
penalized for extended parking in 30-minute zones or on curbs designated for 
street sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers were required to obey meters on downtown byways during the four-month 
reconstruction period.  
</P>
<P>
 Motorists were allowed to ignore parking rules because the Jan. 17 temblor 
damaged the Civic Center parking structure and the Glendale Fashion Center 
garage -- removing 1,268 parking spaces from the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 The 563-space Civic Center garage, located at the corner of Wilson Avenue and 
Isabel Street, reopened to the public in early May, said Jennifer Jenkins, a 
city traffic engineer assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials did not reinstate parking requirements on downtown streets when the 
garage opened because they wanted to give Civic Center employees and other 
motorists time to "get up the courage" to park in the garage, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fashion Center structure at the corner of Glendale and Wilson avenues -- 
with 868 spaces that served the Robinsons-May store that is now closed -- is 
scheduled to be demolished in July. The city has posted signs on the following 
streets informing Civic Center visitors they must follow parking rules: Doran 
Street to the north; Adams Street to the east; Harvard Street to the south, and 
Kenwood Street to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary parking for City Hall along Isabel Street in the northbound lanes 
will remain to ease the loss of parking in the Fashion Center garage -- used 
for overflow parking for downtown visitors, Jenkins said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN PROGRAM PLACES DISABLED IN JOB SETTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Casper, a Cal State Northridge junior, wants to be a television and film 
producer. An internship he secured through a year-old program at CSUN may help 
him meet his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Casper is one of 16 students employed through CSUN's Students With 
Disabilities Internship Project -- the only one of its kind at a California 
university or community college. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, funded by the federal Department of Education, Office of Special 
Education and Rehabilitation Services, provides on-the-job experience for 
students with disabilities and training for both students and employers covered 
by the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 80 students participate in CSUN's program, program coordinator 
Terri Goldstein said. The campus is noted for its innovative work with deaf 
students and those with other disabilities. Casper, 25, has struggled with mild 
dyslexia, which was diagnosed in the fourth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Casper works for Four Point Entertainment, a production company currently in 
partnership with the Samuel Goldwyn Co. to produce an upcoming television show. 
He's involved with "breaking down the script" for the show.  
</P>
<P>
 Casper's job is to read a script and determine how many actors are needed to 
make the show, how many and what kind of props are needed in each scene and 
what sets need to be designed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud that my (supervisor) felt comfortable to ask me to do that," 
Casper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carla Kurachi, 40, secured an internship as a librarian in CSUN's career 
center and later as a career counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurachi has a master's degree in counseling from CSUN. Last fall she enrolled 
in a certificate program for career counseling and needed an internship as part 
of her program. She learned about the program for students with disabilities 
from a campus flyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurachi, a quadriplegic who suffered a spinal cord injury in a car accident, 
said her employers have made her work environment accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have ensured that I can reach all the book cases, and the placement of 
furniture is where I can maneuver my wheelchair around," Kurachi said. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 16, Goldstein will teach employers about their responsibilities and 
rights when providing special accommodations for employees with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein said many employers think accommodations mean big expenses, but that 
is not necessarily the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a copier that enlarges and you have an employee who needs to read 
large print, then you've already solved your problem," she said. 
</P>

 Goldstein said some companies are more receptive than others to working with 
employees with disabilities. She recalled one employer who told her there were 
no jobs for disabled people in her company.

 "She had actually interviewed and wanted to hire someone with a disability who 
chose not to disclose their disability," Goldstein said. "She was just so 
close-minded." TERESA ANN WILLIS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; ANDREW YOUNG TO ADDRESS CSUN GRADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Andrew Young addresses graduating CSUN honors students this weekend about 
overcoming adversity, he speaks with the power of history -- personal history. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, formerly mayor of Atlanta and U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, 
faced bigots, batons and bars of prison cells in his earlier work as a civil 
rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
 As a top aide to Martin Luther King Jr., he knew of struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The students he will address know a little of that themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than five months after the 6.8-magnitude earthquake rattled their school 
and psyches, 968 top students will gather for the Honors Convocation at 2 p.m. 
Sunday at the University Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage at Cal State Northridge is thought to be the costliest at a U. S. 
university from a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who also served three terms in Congress, visited the devastated campus 
only weeks after the earthquake to survey work being done by Law Companies 
Group, an environmental and engineering firm, of which he is vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 He told students at the time that the earthquake "will prepare you in a way 
that just going to the library and doing the fun things about college life 
won't. Most people complete their studies and then go on and get their 
education somewhere else. You are getting yours now." 
</P>
<P>
 The students who hear Young speak Sunday will receive medallions for their 
academic achievements and service to the university and community. 
</P>
<P>
 Other commencement ceremonies are scheduled Monday through Wednesday of next 
week. REBECCA BRYANT

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CHP REPORTS RISE IN HOLIDAY TRAFFIC DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two people died in San Fernando Valley traffic accidents during the Memorial 
Day weekend, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 One person died in North Hollywood and another was killed in Verdugo Hills, 
according to CHP spokesmen Mike Orozco and Pablo Torres. Overall, 13 people 
died in traffic accidents in Los Angeles County and 43 were killed statewide, 
Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patrol arrested 79 people suspected of driving drunk in the San Fernando, 
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys from 6 p.m. Friday to midnight Monday. Of 
these, 30 arrests were made in the West Valley, 25 in the Newhall area, 17 in 
the Verdugo Hills area and seven in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Local arrests accounted for a little over one-third of the 354 drunk driving 
arrests countywide. Patrol officers made 1,780 arrests statewide. Orozco said 
he believed that a successful campaign against drunk driving was responsible 
for the decrease in arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are being a lot more cautious about drunk driving," Orozco said. 
"There's a lot of publicity about it. People are being more responsible." 
Orozco said he could not readily explain why traffic fatalities rose this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics do not include traffic fatalities that were handled by other 
law enforcement agencies, such as the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. LAPD statistics will not be available for 
three to four weeks, according to the department's media relations office. The 
Sheriff's Department also did not have such statistics available on Wednesday. 
Holiday Aftermath While DUI arrests for the Memorial Day weekend were down this 
year from 1993, the number of those killed in traffic collisions was up. Killed 
in Collisions 03,20,06,06 1993 1994 Statwide 29 43 Los Angeles County 8 13 DUI

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; NUDITY AT PARADE REMAINS A MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who were those semi-nude people cavorting through Topanga Canyon on Memorial 
Day, wearing body paint, huge grins and little else? 
</P>
<P>
 The whole town wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's driving everybody crazy!" said Linda Cochrane, manager of Topanga Video. 
"They were fun. Everybody wants to know who they were." 
</P>
<P>
 The bare-skinned enigmas -- two men and three women wearing brown paint, 
loincloths and leaves -- rode atop a float entry called the "Topanga Tribal 
Village" in the annual free-for-all known as the Topanga Memorial Day parade, 
occasionally leaping from their float in paroxysms of primitive lust for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The show of flesh drew a mild reproach from the canyon's established nudists 
from Elysium Fields, who themselves wore discreet towels during the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly were not part of our group," exclaimed Elysium registrar Diane 
Dennis. "We wouldn't do that! We are a club here, and we know our perimeters." 
</P>
<P>
 The scorn of such boundaries by two topless women raised few eyebrows among 
parade-goers already reveling in an event that was part water battle and part 
Dionysian frenzy. With red wine and squirt-gun ammunition flowing freely, who 
was going to notice a little skin? 
</P>
<P>
 But when the post-parade revelry cleared, people began to quiz each other 
about the origin of the brazen "cave people." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become a topic of conversation in the canyon," said Capt. Mike Johnson 
of the Topanga fire station. "Nobody seems to know who they are, which is 
strange in this small town." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they are recent additions to the small, interwoven Topanga community, 
or outsiders come to enjoy its anything-goes atmosphere. And maybe the mystery 
is better left unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one of those mad and crazy things that makes the Topanga parade the 
absolute absurdity and nonsense that it is," said Colin Penno, editor of the 
enclave's weekly newspaper, the Topanga Messenger. "It's the indescribable 
foolishness that doesn't fit in with the straight lines of Los Angeles." KURT

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HEMP LEGALIZATION DRIVE FALLS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The initiative to legalize marijuana in California will fall 185,000 
signatures short of the number needed by today to place the measure on the 
November ballot, organizers at the Sherman Oaks campaign headquarters said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballot co-sponsor Jack Herer said his volunteers were too shaken by the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake and constant police harassment to muster the required 
385,000 signatures, but will try again in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went from 60 volunteers on Jan. 16 in the San Fernando Valley to zero for 
six weeks," said Herer, 54, who helped launch the California Hemp Initiative 
petition drive on Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative sought to decriminalize growing hemp, or the marijuana plant, 
"for industrial, medicinal, nutritional and personal uses, including 
manufacture of paper, clothing, fuel, food and smoking," Herer said. Currently, 
growing hemp of any kind is illegal in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Although volunteers were able to place the initiative on the ballot in 1972 
(it lost), Herer said 1994's volunteers were not as motivated after the 
temblor. Of the 1,000 volunteers who helped statewide to gather signatures, 
Herer said only about 150 delivered on the promise to collect 300 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Herer, who financed $80,000 of the campaign through the sale of his book, 
"Hemp & the Marijuana Conspiracy: The Emperor Wears No Clothes," promised to 
pay petitioners next time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Herer also blamed campus and mall security guards, and police, for scaring 
away volunteers. He cited the Jan. 17 arrest of two petitioners at the Antelope 
Valley Mall, who later had trespassing charges dropped after intervention by 
the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 30 people petitioning in Palmdale before that incident," Herer said. 
"Only one came back. They were scared." JEFF SCHNAUFER

'FREE SPEECH ADVOCATE' ARRESTED AT MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man wearing a shirt, pants and hat carrying messages that condemned God and 
monogamy and encouraged masturbation and a vegetarian diet was arrested 
Wednesday at the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Steffen, 29, of Redwood City, was originally booked on suspicion of 
violating a state law that prohibits "fighting words" in public places where 
such messages are likely to provoke violence, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The booking was later changed to trespassing, said Sgt. Brett Papworth of the 
Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffen was arrested about 1:45 p.m. after mall customers complained that they 
were offended by his shirt, which carried, among other phrases, an obscene 
condemnation of God, Papworth said. Another message on his hat read: "I hate 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 The front of his pants was printed with a vulgar sexual message. "Masturbate 
and be free," was one of the messages on his shirt. "Monogamy rots" was 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 His clothes also contained less unconventional messages. His right pant leg 
read: "Women are equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffen refused to leave the grounds when guards asked him to and "made a 
statement about his free speech rights," Papworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one from the mall's administrative offices or security department could be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages he wears, Steffen said in a telephone interview from the Van Nuys 
jail, are not designed to make people angry but rather to educate them and make 
them think. 
</P>
<P>
 "My primary view is that if people do not express themselves in society, and 
if they are isolated, they fear one another," Steffen said. "So I wrote 
everything I believe, all my assumptions on my shirt, so people can see who I 
am from a distance." 
</P>
<P>
 So after a two-month tour of malls and shopping centers in the San Francisco 
Bay Area, where he said he was threatened by Menlo Park police officers with a 
psychological evaluation unless he cleared out, Steffen traveled south to test 
the tolerance level here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffen was released from the Van Nuys jail by authorities around 7:30 p.m., 
he said. They loaned him a pair of pants because they refused to return his 
clothing, he said. They also gave him a June 22 court date in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the free speech advocate plans to simply design another 
outfit and test the waters in another part of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do enjoy attention, I won't deny that, but I am trying to educate," he said 
after his release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an advocate of free speech."

MAN ACCUSED IN GIRL'S SLAYING TO FACE TRIAL IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles judge returned the case of a man accused of killing an 
8-year-old Woodland Hills girl to a Van Nuys court for trial on Wednesday after 
prosecutors and defense attorneys failed to reach a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooman Ashkan Panah, 22, of Woodland Hills would be eligible for the death 
penalty if he is convicted of the Nov. 20 slaying of Nicole Parker, whose nude 
body was discovered stuffed in a suitcase in Panah's closet a day after she 
disappeared from her father's apartment in the same Ventura Boulevard complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah has pleaded not guilty to seven charges, including murder, kidnaping and 
sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury also charged Panah with four special-circumstance allegations -- 
murder in conjunction with kidnaping, sodomy, child molestation and oral 
copulation -- each of which makes him eligible for the death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance Ito chose to transfer the case to Van Nuys during a 
hearing Wednesday in downtown Los Angeles, despite numerous objections by 
defense attorney Robert Sheahen that Panah could not receive a fair trial in 
the San Fernando Valley because of the widespread publicity given the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter Berman disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Menendez brothers can be tried anywhere in the county, this case can 
be too," Berman said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahen has said he plans to use a psychological defense. "Hooman has a 
history of hospitalization for mental disorders," Sheahen said earlier, citing 
records that show Panah received psychiatric treatment in 1988, six months 
after he left his native Iran.  
</P>
<P>
 Ito also ruled Wednesday that Sheahen and M. Syamak Shafi-Nia should continue 
to represent Panah as his court-appointed attorneys. Ito had temporarily 
assigned the attorneys to Panah's case while they and Berman discussed the 
possibility of a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said Ito also came to his decision after the two attorneys said they 
would be ready to go to trial by late summer, which would reduce the expense 
that further delays in the case may have produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahen told Ito during the hearing that he was not eager to spend the next 12 
months as defense counsel for Panah, but conceded that he is the best qualified 
because he has built a relationship of trust with Panah and knows the details 
of the case.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can provide the best defense that anyone can in this case," Sheahen said 
later in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The mothers of Panah and Parker erupted almost simultaneously into tears 
Wednesday in Ito's courtroom when Panah testified that he wanted both of his 
attorneys to continue to represent him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheahen said he will file a motion at Wednesday's hearing in Van Nuys to move 
the trial.

ATTORNEY ACCUSES AUCTION HOUSE OF FRAUD; TRIAL: LAWYER SAYS SUPERIOR STAMP & 
COIN CO. ORCHESTRATED 'AN UNPARALLELED SCHEME' TO SWINDLE HIS CLIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A coin auction house co-owned by sports magnate Bruce McNall was accused 
Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior court of orchestrating a fraud scheme to take 
advantage of the daughters of a Thousand Oaks millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert A. Levinson, an attorney representing the sisters suing the Superior 
Stamp & Coin Co., told a judge during opening statements that evidence will 
show his clients fell victim to an "unparalleled scheme of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 The embattled McNall, who is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, owns 51% 
of Superior. Last week he entered into bankruptcy proceedings and recently sold 
72% of the Los Angeles Kings franchise to pay off a business loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Trompeter Gonzalez and her sister, Janet Trompeter Polachek, sued 
Superior in 1992 over its handling of their father Emanuel "Ed" Trompeter's 
coin collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Before dying of inoperable cancer, Ed Trompeter, a Westlake Village 
electronics manufacturer, decided to sell his collection that included some of 
the rarest U.S. coins, fearing his daughters could fall prey to an unscrupulous 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Trompeter hired Superior to sell, in two auctions, nearly 400 coins he had 
gathered over 20 years. But a legal battle erupted after the first auction, 
which took in $3.5 million in gross proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters -- who are seeking $1.5 million in legal fees and damages -- 
allege that Superior breached its contract with their father by improperly 
keeping $350,000 in commissions from the first auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The women also accuse Superior of overcharging their father $100,000 for a set 
of coins he purchased in 1990, and for charging them about $1 million the 
company claimed Ed Trompeter owed at the time of his death in 1992, Levinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinson also accused Superior officials of stonewalling the sisters when they 
asked questions about the condition of the rare coin market prior to the second 
auction. The women subsequently hired experts who informed them the market had 
taken a substantial downturn, prompting them to file a court injunction to stop 
Superior from going forward with the second auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior filed a counterclaim seeking commissions it expected to earn from the 
second auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Revere, an attorney for Superior, began his opening statements Wednesday 
by denying any wrongdoing, fraud or deceit on the part of his clients in 
regards to Ed Trompeter's trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere said Trompeter had spent $18 million on his hobby of collecting rare 
coins and had extensive dealings over the years with Ira Goldberg, a Superior 
co-president named as a defendant in the lawsuit. He said Trompeter owed 
Superior $900,000 plus interest for a group of coins he purchased known as the 
Amazonian Set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was during a meeting in April, 1991, that Trompeter signed a promissory 
note left blank at the time because neither party was certain of how much 
interest had accrued on the debt, Revere alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 In a trial brief filed with the court, however, Levinson contended that 
Superior filled in the blank after Trompeter had died, and that he only owed 
the company about half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in dispute is the commission Superior received from the first auction. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Levinson, Superior agreed in the contract to keep only a 7.5% 
"seller's commission" from the sale. But Superior, he said, improperly 
collected another $350,000 in commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Trompeter Gonzalez, of Mexico, has possession of the rest of the coins 
from her father's collection, but remains uncertain as to what she plans to do 
with them, Levinson said. "She won't sell them through Superior that's for 
sure," Levinson.  
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez testified in court Wednesday before Superior Court Judge Daniel A. 
Curry -- who will decide the case because both parties waved their rights to a 
jury trial -- that her father started his electronics business at age 45 in the 
garage of the family's Canoga Park home. 
</P>
<P>
 As the business developed the company moved to a plant in Canoga Park, then 
Chatsworth and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinson said McNall, who was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, is 
expected to testify on behalf of the defense when they present their case 
probably sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Miller, an attorney representing Superior co-owner Goldberg and his 
brother Larry Goldberg, said his clients have entered into agreements to buy 
out McNall's 51% stock interest in the coin company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goldbergs alleged in a lawsuit settled this year that McNall used $4.6 
million from a bank credit line because he needed the money to maintain other 
ventures and his extraordinary lifestyle.

AROUND THE VALLEY: IS THE NEW AGE GETTING OLD? THEN CHANGE THE CHANNELER

 It was a dark and balmy night.  
</P>
<P>
 A perfect night to lock into the energies associated with the full moon, in 
company with members of metaphysical movements deeply rooted in Los Angeles' 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 A dark night because the moonlight was blurred by overcast. 
</P>
<P>
 To the strains of a Shakuhachi flute, about 140 adults, old and young, 
silently took seats arranged in circles in the Sepulveda Unitarian Universalist 
Society's bulbous wooden sanctuary nicknamed "the Onion." 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation, known for skepticism but with a typical openness to other 
beliefs, had allowed an old New Age coalition known as the Los Angeles 
InterGroup to use the mystically suggestive structure for full-moon meditation 
services, or "festivals." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcoming words came from Jeriel C. Smith, a Century City attorney who, with 
his wife, leads a small meditation group in Tujunga called the Open Lotus 
Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you for joining our annual celebration of the Festival of Humanity . . 
. on the eve of the full moon in the solar month of Gemini," said Smith, noting 
that similar gatherings were being held around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work in which we and they are cooperating -- group meditation in the 
service of Humanity -- takes place in silence upon the mental plane and has 
profound effects upon all of the invisible levels of the energetic existence 
which permeates all living matter, including the planet itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants lit candles on a small, round table, first to invoke the Divine 
Presence, then in turn the deities of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, 
Judaism and Taoism. 
</P>
<P>
 The meditators named Lord Buddha, Allah and other deities, chanting "Om" for 
10 seconds after each. 
</P>
<P>
 As the last candle was lit, people were invited to "name the Divine 
Representation of your choice," and quite a few did. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, as printed instructions advised, everyone joined "in singing the 
sacred Om in a continuous rhythm . . . until we sense the Divine Presence as 
grounded and embodied." 
</P>
<P>
 The monotone chant lasted a little over a minute until somehow experience or 
common sense said that was long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Musician David Zasloff was reintroduced, playing the Autoharp. "Please, no 
applause during the program," the instructions read. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lecture that took listeners through the year, relating equinoxes and 
solstices and moons to the cycles of emotion and "mental centers" in the human 
body, Georgia Lambert spoke as if she was teaching a class. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she brought 40 students from her Monday night class at Griffith Park 
on "The Nature of Soul" to this service and gave her lecture there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Ann Smith, wife of Jeriel, alternated with Guy Michael Douglass of "The 
Nature of Soul" group in reciting words of guidance for the meditators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Send forth a stream of illumined thoughts. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 OMMMMMMMM. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . to all who care, to all who love humanity. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 OMMMMMMMM. 
</P>
<P>
 "We invoke with one world voice divine energy that will transform Humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 OMMMMMMMM. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants were then asked to "cross the threshold of silence." 
</P>
<P>
 The next 10 minutes were so quiet -- without a cough or creaking chair -- that 
you could hear the traffic on usually quiet Haskell Avenue and a jet flying 
high over the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was time to recite the Great Invocation. Many present recited from 
memory the 113 words passed on decades ago by Alice Bailey, which she said she 
learned from "the Tibetan," a guru whose thoughts she perceived telepathically. 
</P>
<P>
 While in America in 1915, the British-born Bailey became interested in 
theosophy, a blending of Eastern and Western philosophy most notably propounded 
by Madame Helena Blavatsky (1831-1891). Bailey rose to prominence in one wing 
of the movement, moving its headquarters to a Hollywood retreat called Krotona. 
</P>
<P>
 She fell out with other leaders in 1920 and later moved to New York. But her 
writings between 1919 and her death in 1949 inspired followers in California to 
keep her vision alive even as they added other interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Invocation purports to summon emanations from the Mind, Heart and 
Will of God, and even asks that "Christ may return to Earth." A footnote to the 
name Christ in the printed program advises that "the coming one" of another 
faith may be substituted at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenda Christian, a teacher of esoterica at the University of the Seven Rays 
in Los Angeles, led a closing ritual intended to radiate symbolically the 
summoned energies of harmony, intelligence, etc., out to Humanity, with 
participants carrying candles to the periphery of the sanctuary, followed by a 
final chanting of Om three times. 
</P>
<P>
 As the gathering slowly broke up, Jeriel Smith said participants are free to 
reject any teaching or aspect of the ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 One counsel from Alice Bailey -- or the Tibetan -- was "if you can't validate 
it by personal experience, then don't validate it," according to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 An ominous warning in the program, it turns out, was not to be taken 
literally: 
</P>
<P>
 "The energies invoked at the festivals may be over-stimulating for very young 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Watson of Canoga Park, who edits a New Age newsletter, said with a smile: 
"That's just a polite way to say don't bring small children."

DEPUTIES ARREST DRIVER AFTER 10-MILE HIGH-SPEED CHASE

 A suspected drunk driver was arrested after he led Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies on a chase from Bell Canyon to Canoga Park that ended after he crashed 
his luxury sports car, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Roberts, 43, of Salt Lake City was being held on $35,000 bail at the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys Division Jail on Wednesday.Roberts was 
arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and evading arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase started about 11:45 p.m. Tuesday when Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies passing through Los Angeles County noticed that a car had run a red 
light, Senior Deputy Hallett Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he and Deputy William Gentry tried to stop the speeding Jaguar 
because they thought that it might be stolen. One of the car's windows was 
broken, which is a common way for thieves to enter a car, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver refused to pull over and led deputies on a 10-mile chase on surface 
streets in Canoga Park, with speeds reaching 80 m.p.h., Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those things have some power to them," said Sullivan, who was chasing the 
Jaguar in a department-issued Ford Crown Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase ended when the Jaguar ran another red light and hit a car at high 
speed at Saticoy Street and Topanga Canyon Boulevard, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the other car, Madeleine Hovspian, 22, of Tarzana, received 
minor injuries. Roberts' car spun out of control and came to rest at the curb, 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Van Nuys Municipal Court.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PRESIDENT OF BANK IS EXPECTED TO BE FIRED; 
FINANCE: RESIGNATION HAD BEEN SOUGHT. OFFICIALS ARE UNHAPPY WITH VALENCIA 
NATIONAL'S PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of Valencia National Bank apparently will be fired this week 
after failing to submit his resignation before a deadline set by the board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Manley, 51, one of the bank's founders when it opened in 1987, accused 
the board last week of asking for his resignation because he was getting tough 
about collecting loan payments from present and former board members. 
</P>
<P>
 A prepared statement released by the board Wednesday called Manley's 
accusations a smoke screen and stated that directors were unsatisfied with the 
bank's service and financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting two years ago, the Board had extensive meetings with Manley and his 
management to improve the situation," the statement reads. "After many such 
meetings, the Board concluded that, although Manley helped the bank get off its 
feet, grow to three branches, and become profitable, he was not the best choice 
to take the bank through its next phase of growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Net income at the bank has dropped from $511,982 in 1990 to $29,454 in 1993, 
according to bank reports. But the bank lost about $200,000 in 1993 because of 
a defaulted loan to a former board member, and an unspecified amount of 
additional money from other outstanding loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley failed to respond to the board's request for his resignation by last 
weekend's deadline and "a board meeting has been scheduled this week to 
conclude the matter," the statement adds.  
</P>
<P>
 Lou Garasi, chairman of the board, has stated previously that Manley would be 
terminated if he did not resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley is on vacation out of the state and could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. He stated in a previous interview that outstanding loans to board 
members and the legal fees spent trying to collect them have cost the bank 
"several hundred thousand dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Garasi confirmed that at least two former board members had outstanding loans. 
He said both met the bank's credit and regulation requirements, but unexpected 
situations arose. 
</P>
<P>
 "One was a fraudulent situation -- that very seldom happens," he said. "The 
other one was someone involved in real estate who ended up in a situation where 
cash flow did not continue (because of) the slowing down of the economy during 
the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Manley was part of the committee that approved the loans, Garasi added. 
</P>
<P>
 Garasi declined to identify the loan holders, stating he is forbidden by 
banking regulations from doing so.  
</P>
<P>
 The bank has "made other collateral" arrangements with an unnamed former 
director who has a $200,000 outstanding loan and hopes to recover the money, 
although it was required by federal banking regulations to charge off the loan 
and take a loss in 1993, according to the bank's prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Other former and current board members have loans at the bank, but bank 
officials said the amounts owed are not significant and no current board member 
has repayment problems. Garasi said the bank remains in sound financial shape 
and the defaulted loans are not sufficient to endanger that standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia National Bank is the Santa Clarita Valley's only locally-based bank, 
with branches in Valencia, Newhall and Canyon Country. Current board members 
include Garasi, Chuck Albrecq, Gene Burke, Walt Fisher, Dick Keysor, Joseph 
McKeon, Bob Nahabit and Rick Patterson.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; GROUP BACKS PLAN TO LURE TOURISTS, FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Members of a new organization aimed at boosting the Antelope Valley's economy 
on Wednesday endorsed a $300,000 marketing campaign and vowed to help set up a 
program to bring more tourists and film crews to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Regional Partnership, made up of city and business leaders 
from Palmdale and Lancaster, plus representatives of Antelope Valley College 
and Los Angeles County, discussed the economic development issues during a 
kickoff meeting at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization was formed at the urging of a consultant, hired by the two 
cities, who concluded that Lancaster, Palmdale and the county should pool their 
resources to attract new employers, conventions and film crews to the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through this organization, I think we'll be much more effective," said Al 
McCord, Palmdale's economic development director. 
</P>
<P>
 Vern Lawson, executive director of the Antelope Valley Economic Development 
Corp., unveiled the proposed $300,000 budget to encourage industrial employers 
in the San Fernando Valley and other areas to move their businesses to the 
Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be used for advertising, public relations and a special event 
in Palmdale for prospective employers. The marketing drive would emphasize the 
availability of land, relatively low land prices, the large number of skilled 
workers living in the area and the low crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's meeting, members of the regional partnership endorsed the 
marketing plan and urged the city councils of Palmdale and Lancaster to 
allocate money for the project. The group also voted to recommend that the 
cities extend their offer of a $2,000 financial incentive for each new 
industrial job brought to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cities already have joined forces to offer financial incentives to 
computer-maker Packard Bell, which is considering a move to Palmdale. But 
McCord told members of the panel that the company has not yet decided whether 
to move to Palmdale or to another state. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant who urged the cities to join forces to attract new employers 
also said local leaders should set up a regional tourism and film commission to 
bring more conventions, tourists and film crews to the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford said the commission should not be set up until the 
two cities equalize their bed taxes, which are charged to hotel guests at the 
rate of 7% in Lancaster and 10% in Palmdale. Proponents say part of this tax 
money should be used to finance the tourism and film commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledford also said it was wrong for some local groups, such as the Lancaster 
Chamber of Commerce, to start launching these programs before the cities have 
allocated funds for them and without the cooperation of the Palmdale Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fragmented effort, and I think it is dangerous," Ledford said. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed to join Lancaster Councilman George Runner and Sherry Lasagna, Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich's Antelope Valley aide, at a meeting 
with leaders of the two chambers to talk about a regional program to boost 
tourism and filmmaking.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 5-STORY OAK FALLS ON LODGE; BOUQUET CANYON: A 
CORNER OF THE ROOF IS CRUSHED, BUT NO ONE IS INJURED. 'IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A 
MOTHER NATURE ATTACK,' OWNER SAYS OF LATEST DISASTER. 
</P>

<P>
 Mother Nature apparently has it in for the Big Oaks Lodge in Bouquet Canyon. A 
mammoth oak tree crashed onto the roof of the rural landmark this week -- the 
latest in a string of natural disasters that have plagued the colorful, 
turn-of-the century bar and restaurant in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-story oak toppled at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, a mighty cr-r-rack its 
only warning to the bartender and the three customers inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Foot-thick limbs came crashing down into the newly remodeled second-story, 
splitting the fresh wood and crushing a roof-top corner overlooking the lodge's 
outdoor picnic tables. The falling tree uprooted concrete from the surrounding 
patio and pried boards from the building's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't even break the downstairs window," said a surprised Dee White, 
owner of the lodge, which has rebounded from fires, floods, earthquakes -- and 
other falling trees. "We finished (remodeling the second floor) about three 
days ago. We just ordered the windows." 
</P>
<P>
 Flames scorched the lodge in January, 1990, causing $150,000 in damage and 
shutting it down for four months. Heavy rains flooded a Bouquet Canyon Road 
bridge, closing the road to the restaurant from January through April of 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the building was not damaged, preoccupied customers disappeared again 
following the Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems like a Mother Nature attack," said White, surveying the tree 
still leaning against the lodge Wednesday. "It's just heart-wrenching." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there have been bright spots among the disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt Tuesday, despite the area beneath the tree being filled with 
people at that time of day the two evenings before it fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The lodge, high in the mountains above the Santa Clarita Valley, is a popular 
landmark for rural travelers, and in recent years has served as a training site 
for heavyweight boxing contenders, including Michael Dokes and Tony Tubbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining room, built in 1929 and evolving from a collection of nine lodges 
that predate the area's written history and local memories, remains undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Other centuries-old oaks ring the lodge's patio, survivors of the nearly dozen 
trees that used to shade the area. The oak that fell Tuesday was the fourth to 
topple over, but the first to strike the lodge. One fell seven years ago; a 
second toppled over in 1992 and another fell last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all started together. Maybe they're all going to die together," White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's likely, according to Ray Miramontez, arborist for the nearby city of 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest trees often have connecting roots, making them prone to sharing 
diseases, Miramontez said. Oaks also are sensitive to any disruption of their 
environment, such as a break in their water supply or soil nutrients caused by 
construction in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very sensitive to change," said Miramontez. "It's not uncommon that 
an oak tree that would've lived to 400 or 500 has its life cut in half by 
(nearby) development." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak tree damage is often not immediately detectable, sometimes appearing 15 
years from when a problem actually begins, Miramontez said,  
</P>
<P>
 White said she is unsure if her insurance will cover this latest act of God. 
She hopes to reopen the lodge today.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN GUILTY OF TRYING TO KILL EX-GIRLFRIEND; 
TRIAL: JOHNNY MACK FINNEY OF VAL VERDE COULD SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN 
PRISON AFTER SETTING THE WOMAN ON FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Val Verde man who poured gasoline on his ex-girlfriend and set her on fire 
was found guilty Wednesday of attempted first-degree murder and could spend the 
rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys Superior Court jury deliberated for about two days before finding 
Johnny Mack Finney, 39, guilty of attempted murder and four lesser charges 
stemming from the Aug. 1, 1993, attack on Janice Johnson, 31, at her Val Verde 
home, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson sustained life-threatening second- and third-degree burns to about 
one-fourth of her body in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said the verdict was surprising because the jury chose to convict 
Finney of all five charges, even though the guilty verdict on the lesser 
charges will not affect the sentence he probably will receive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury could not find the defendant guilty of enough things," Greenberg 
said. "Normally, what happens is if they find the defendant guilty of a greater 
offense they usually ignore the lesser ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard Waco argued that Finney should, at most, be 
convicted of two lesser felony assault charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Waco said he suspects the multiple conviction was caused by jury confusion, 
not any desire to send a vindictive message to Finney. The defense attorney 
said he was "surprised and somewhat disappointed" by the verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury just couldn't get away from the victim's burns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, now living in California City, is on disability after the burns 
disfigured her face and upper body and limited the use of one arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Finney and Johnson dated intermittently for about four years. The couple have 
two children, ages 2 years and 10 months. She also has a son, then 14, from a 
previous relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the assault was sparked by Johnson's breakup with Finney. 
Waco argued during the trial that Finney's judgment was so poor because of his 
constant drug and alcohol use that he could not coherently plot to kill 
Johnson, and the attack was a misguided attempt to frighten her. 
</P>
<P>
 Finney asked Johnson to go into the bathroom to talk to him, emptied a 
two-liter plastic soft drink bottle of gasoline on her, then threw a lighter at 
her as the three children watched. A neighbor who drove Finney to Johnson's 
house, not knowing his intentions, heard Johnson screaming and rushed in to put 
out the fire using his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finney sustained third-degree burns to his arms, but walked away from 
Johnson's house. Sheriff's deputies arrested him a short time later while he 
was walking toward his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Candace Beason will sentence Finney on June 15. He could 
receive life in prison for the attempted murder and be eligible for parole 
after 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenberg said it is rare for a person convicted of such an offense to be 
released that early. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing on the other charges will probably run concurrent to his attempted 
murder sentence, so no additional prison time will result, Greenberg added. 
</P>
<P>
 Waco said he will appeal the verdict, arguing that Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff 
Jonas, who prosecuted the case, made statements of opinion and introduced 
evidence during the trial that may have unfairly prejudiced the jury.

BY DESIGN; MUCKENTHALER'S MAN OF MANY HATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I f wherever you hang your hat is home, then the Muckenthaler Cultural Center 
in Fullerton must seem pretty welcoming these days. Give credit to exhibition 
administrator Robert Zingg, lately an artsy stand-in for the Mad Hatter.  
</P>
<P>
 His current exhibit, which runs through June 26, is on "Haute Hats."  
</P>
<P>
 But these aren't your average head ornaments or sun shades. The 32-year-old 
Zingg points out that hats have historically been used to connote wealth, 
religion, culture, nationality, rank, political belief or occupation. There are 
more than 50 of them displayed, from the turn of the century to the present.  
</P>
<P>
 The busy Zingg (he's also curated shows on kites, Art Deco toys and kinetic 
sculpture for the Muckenthaler) says that "much like creating a hat, there's a 
lot of behind-the-scenes work that goes into creating an exhibit."  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 I never really paid much attention to hats until now because when I was 
growing up in the '60s and '70s, there weren't too many that stood out, except 
Jackie Kennedy's pillbox, which became a cultural icon like Charlie Chaplin's 
bowler. 
</P>
<P>
 As a kid, I was too young to watch Fess Parker play "Davy Crockett" on TV in 
the '60s, so I never wanted one of those coonskin hats. And when I was older, 
it was the Farrah-hair era, and everyone wore lots of hair instead of hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Before, I would only wear baseball caps on a bad hair day, but after seeing 
this exhibit, I want a Panama-style hat made of tightly woven, beautifully 
finished straw from the '40s, like the one we have in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The hats come from private collections, the Costume and Textile Guild of North 
Orange County and Louise Green Millinery of Santa Monica. There are also some 
from contemporary artists Sayra Adams and Lyric Watson, who make them by hand 
and one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing my research I found, surprisingly, that there isn't a lot written 
about hats. Much like an archeological dig, the Costume and Textile Guild 
searches through old Sears catalogues to find information on the styles popular 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 We also found that the "theater rule" started in 1907, which forced woman to 
take their picture hats off during a performance, and the National Audubon 
Society came into existence in 1905 because the bird population was being 
decimated by the millinery trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did ladies want aigrettes placed on their hats but the whole egret 
bird. Aigrette substitutes like dyed goose and chicken feathers were used 
afterward. Other hat trimmings over the years include fruits, flowers, leaves, 
veils, grosgrain, ball fringe, beads, tiny mirrors, bangles, fur, tweed, lace 
and pompons. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I produced this exhibit, I thought all it took to make a hat was a hat 
body and somebody to put some stuff on it. Now I know the difference between 
the crown, brim, band, sweatband and trimmings and how the hat design reflects 
other trends in fashion at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried to make the exhibit educational as well as visual. Rather than just 
show a finished hat, we use photomurals to show the process and the raw 
materials used to make it. We have different hat bodies made of straw, velour, 
felt, velvet and rolled paper, called toyo.  
</P>

 And we have a glossary of names. Most of them are French -- like chapeau (hat) 
or cloche (a tight-fitting one pulled over the forehead) -- because at the 
beginning of the century, Paris was the hat mecca.

 The opening of the much-anticipated, multimillion-dollar epic "Endless Summer 
II" Friday has the surf industry holding its breath, but it's not only over the 
film's breathtaking scenes. "We're thinking the industry in general will get a 
boost," says Jerry Lund, sales VP for Rusty. The Irvine surf-wear line will no 
doubt reap from the appearance of its label on featured surfer Pat O'Connell of 
Laguna Niguel. In the documentary, O'Connell sports the reggae-inspired 
"Stoner" and Hawaiian printed "Paradise" trunks (about $38) -- already rad 
sellers among locals. Natural Sense

 If you think your "natural" skin-care products are as good for you as they are 
for the planet, think again. Many are loaded with preservatives and chemicals 
that not only hurt your skin but further pollute the land. There's also the 
issue of packaging. Even with coded arrows, just 3% of the 60 billion pounds of 
plastic produced is recycled annually, estimates the EPA. Troubled by this, 
Keith Waldon, 28, started Earth Preserv, a line of earth-friendly products free 
of synthetics. It's bottled in natural mineral aluminum, which is 70% 
recyclable. To make it affordable (from $7 to $20), Waldon hit JCPenney and 
will go mail-order later this year. And 5% of gross sales will fund 
environmental clean-up programs. "When you understand environmental problems 
and how consumers impact them," says Waldon, "you feel compelled to seek out a 
solution." Basic Instinct

 Even the silkiest lingerie can't substitute for the comfort of cotton -- 
especially during sweltering summer days. Cotton underthings, says Target style 
consultant Corbin Seitz, appeal "to the '90s and this whole return to a simple, 
natural, earthy way of living." Target took a cue with the addition of Gilligan 
& O'Malley intimate apparel. Find cotton bras (including under-wires) and 
panties for less than $10 and chemises, pajama sets and nightgowns under $20. 
With details of eyelet, lace and pointelle, some pieces can double as 
outerwear, Seitz adds. Making a Killing

 Few items epitomize hippy style like those leather accessories with flowers 
and butterflies stamped out in craft classes in the '70s. But don't tell 
artisan Robert Rasmussen that. His chokers, bracelets, earrings and ponytail 
holders (about $6) are finding fans among a greater crowd than modern hippies. 
Indeed, Roadkill Ent. of Anaheim is doing so well in Nordstrom and other 
boutiques that a signature store will open soon in Orange. "I'm not trying to 
be trendy," Rasmussen says. "It just took off that way." ROSE APODACA JONES

RUNWAY TO REALITY: DOUBLE-BREASTED SUIT NOT A MURPHY BROWN EXCLUSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA DENDEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Look: The most elegant pantsuit has to be the one TV's Murphy Brown is so 
fond of -- double-breasted, with a plunging shawl collar. The most daring 
working girls wear nothing but an amazing necklace underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Do It Big: Giorgio Armani does a rich lightweight wool crepe pantsuit in 
taupe, white, creme, navy and, of course, black. It costs $1,975. The glass 
bead lariat necklace is $350. At $16.50, the macrame shoulder bag is a bargain. 
The whole ensemble is available at the Giorgio Armani boutique on Rodeo Drive 
and at I. Magnin, Fashion Island Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Total price: $2,341.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Do It Budget: It's rare to find an inexpensive pantsuit that looks as if it's 
been made by expert Italian tailors. This jacket in a blend of 50% wool and 50% 
polyester is only $39.95 at the Hit or Miss stores throughout the county. (A 
matching short skirt is $14.99.) The pleated pants in 100% taupe wool gabardine 
are by San Francisco designer Ceceilia Hsu for CEZU. They're cut beautifully 
for $118 and can be special-ordered through B. Magness in Newport Beach. The 
glass beaded necklace is a handmade concoction fashioned, for a total of $50, 
from a necklace, two bracelets and a pair of earrings from Pier 1 Imports. This 
$10 macrame bag is from Bun-Ka Do, a little shop in Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Total amount: $217.95. JOANNA DENDEL

DEADLINE IS SATURDAY IN LATINO MODEL SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Registration for the 1994 Hispanic Designers Model Search continues through 
Saturday at JCPenney stores in the Buena Park Mall, The City Shopping Center in 
Orange, South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, the Mall of Orange, Westminster Mall 
and Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men and women of Latino descent can register to participate in the 
annual event sponsored by Hispanic Designers Inc. and JCPenney. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth annual event will honor hundreds of young Latinos nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-four semi-finalists from participating JCPenney markets will compete in 
the National Hispanic Designers Model Search to be held in Dallas on Sept. 9. 
Two national grand winners (male and female) and two runners-up will be 
selected to represent Hispanic Designers Inc. and JCPenney on the runway as 
well as in selected print and broadcast advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 The national winners will also receive a $2,500 scholarship from the two 
sponsors. Runners-up will receive a $1,500 scholarship. National winners will 
also be awarded a one-year scholarship to the Fashion Institute of Design and 
Merchandising in Los Angeles, a $1,000 JCPenney wardrobe, a Juvenia gold watch, 
fragrance packages from Elizabeth Taylor's Passion and gifts from Colores Para 
Ti cosmetics. National runners-up will receive a $500 JCPenney wardrobe and 
other prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program encourages participants to pursue their education, and it 
provides an exciting and glamorous introduction to the world of fashion and 
modeling," says Penney's Patricia Asip. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the model search, winners will have the opportunity to take the 
runway at the annual Hispanic Designers Gala & Fashion Show held in Washington, 
D.C., on Sept. 29. There, they will model from the fashion collections of such 
top designers as Carolina Herrera, Oscar de la Renta and Paloma Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To participate in the search, men and women of Latino descent must be age 16 
to 22 and have a non-professional modeling status. (Registrants under 18 
require consent from parent or legal guardian to apply.) Applications can be 
obtained from JCPenney departments stores in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners selected from these markets will be flown to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hispanic Designers Inc. is a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to 
recognizing Latino talent and cultural contributions. The honorary board 
includes such designers as Adolfo, Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Herrera and 
Paloma Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the Washington, D.C. Hispanic Designers Gala & Fashion Show will 
benefit the HDI programs, which help Latino students with scholarships. HDI 
also sponsors a summer internship program. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Hispanic Designers celebrates our 10th anniversary, we enter a new decade 
with enthusiasm and commitment to improve opportunities for young people," says 
president Penny Harrison. "Working with a major retailing force like JCPenney 
is an integral part of increasing the awareness of and rewarding the talent 
that lies within the Hispanic community."

TINY 'BACKPACKS' MAKE A BIG-CITY FASHION STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Backpacks, once reserved for back-country hikers and book-toting students, are 
showing up in small sizes as chic city carryalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these mini packs, ranging in size from a sheet of writing paper to a 
note card, actually pack more fashion punch than personal items. David Wolfe, a 
trend analyst for the Doneger Group in New York, calls them back purses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a backpack and a purse married and had a little baby," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 These babies first showed up as accessories on the runways of Milan, Paris and 
New York. In satin, faille and metallics, they're making the club scene. More 
traditional fabrications make them ideal for daytime wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny totes from the likes of Chanel, Gucci, Anne Klein, Donna Karan and Fred 
Hayman of Beverly Hills add instant status. Chanel, for example, has drawstring 
mini backpacks in gold or bronze metallic leather that coordinate with the 
Chanel metallic-thread suit. With signature double-C closures on pockets and 
goldtone chain straps, they retail for about $1,415 at selected Chanel 
boutiques nationwide beginning in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're another option to clutch bags that you just toss over your shoulder 
and swing around," says Anne Fahey, Chanel public relations manager in New 
York. "They're a playful version of shoulder bags for the evening." 
</P>
<P>
 Due to their shrunken size, mini backpacks are more suited for after-five, 
when you're not wrestling with a bag filled with appointment books and grocery 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "You basically can stuff in your lipstick, comb and money -- most of the tiny 
backpacks won't even accommodate a wallet," says Reenie Brown, publication 
director for Accessories magazine in Norwalk, Conn. "They're just a fun, 
gimmicky item, a tongue-in-cheek statement. They're not going to mean a lot in 
the long run because, logically speaking, 'mini' is almost an oxymoron in terms 
of backpacks." 
</P>
<P>
 For a quick hit of glitz, there's no shortage of evening-worthy fabrications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Designers are glittering them up with rhinestones, velvet, silver and gold, 
silk tulle, shiny cotton and beaded chenille," Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, they're more decorative than functional. 
</P>
<P>
 "A big backpack is obviously more practical," says Steven Somers, president 
and CEO of Oroton, leather goods manufacturer for Anne Klein handbags in New 
York. "A mini backpack is just cute and has all the components of a backpack 
that sits on your back, but it's tiny. It's like a miniature Porsche. So as a 
classification, it's selling very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Klein's black microfiber mini pack runs about $195 at Anne Klein stores 
nationwide and at selected Saks Fifth Avenue stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A teeny backpack can work for everyday use, provided you also carry a tote. 
For daytime, you'll find plenty of mini backpacks in dressed-down leather, 
suede and nubuck. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you carry a briefcase, you can still throw the backpack on your back and 
have a free hand. It creates 'another hand,' and it's also a look," says Paul 
Blum, vice president of merchandising for Kenneth Cole in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Cole offers a mini backpack, about $102 in black or sand grainy 
cowhide; it's sold at Kenneth Cole stores in New York, Los Angeles and San 
Francisco and at Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Saks Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby boomers gained an appreciation for backpacks for toting schoolbooks," 
Blum says. "And when they entered the business world, they missed the 
convenience. What's fueling them now is the casual sophistication. They enable 
you to make a fashion statement and still maintain a corporate image. They've 
simply gone from nylon to leather." 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cavemen used skin to transport items over their shoulder," says Ellen 
Goldstein, chairman of the accessories department at New York's Fashion 
Institute of Technology. "It was really a primitive form of a backpack."

OLD AND IMPROVED; WITH A FEW SNIPS HERE AND THERE AND A LITTLE THREAD, VINTAGE 
CLOTHES CAN BE REBORN AND REWORN

 A 1940s rayon dress can be a divine piece of work. Great geometric print. Bias 
cut. Exquisite detailing. 
</P>
<P>
 It can also be pretty dowdy, ruined by a matronly neckline, cigarette burns, 
gruesome armpits. 
</P>
<P>
 To the untrained eye, such a dress looks terminal. To others, unwilling to 
give up anything with a shred of life left in it, there are "possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 They see beyond the given. Beyond the dowdiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Freedman-Borsuk, owner of Polkadots & Moonbeams, a vintage clothing 
store on 3rd Street in Los Angeles, frequently finds "dresses that are so 
incredible, you don't want to throw them away." But "the pits are shot," a 
combination of too much wear and tear, perspiration and heavy doses of 
deodorant. She cuts a little here and there, excising the offending parts and 
salvaging the good ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the problems with these dresses are in the tops," she says. "Nobody 
likes a high neckline; they should be sexy." To that end, she cuts necklines 
and armholes so deep they need bodysuits or lacy camisoles underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Definitely not our mother's little print dress. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, she contemporizes them. "I try to make dresses wearable for 
today," Freedman- Borsuk says. And wearable for a wider (definite double 
meaning here) audience. So much vintage clothing looks so . . . Size 8-ish. Her 
alterations not only get rid of stains, rips and burn marks, they make dresses 
fit larger bodies. Hip, hip, hooray. And even when a dress fits just as it did 
on the original owner, Freedman-Borsuk says today's wearer would feel too 
confined in it. "We're used to more freedom of movement."  
</P>
<P>
 To some people, off-the-rack vintage clothing may seem too trendy, too young, 
too much of an attention-getter. But altering a dress or outfit can give it 
wider appeal. Take those rickracked-with-a-vengeance square-dance outfits. 
Great for Dale Evans look-alike contests, but what about dinner at Louise's 
Trattoria? The tops: dreadful, kitschy. The skirts: fantastic except for the 
kiss-of-death mid-knee length. The solution: cannibalize the top, cutting 
strips to use for a yoke that will lengthen the skirt into a fashionable, 
flattering mid-calf length -- and great with a knit top. 
</P>
<P>
 When costume designer Pat Tonnema found a 1940s, smoky blue, geometric print 
dress at a flea market, it was the skirt, with its double row of ruffles around 
the hem, that she loved. So she cut off the ho-hum top, added a waistband and 
wears it with T-shirts. "The ruffles give it a great weight when I walk. It 
looks fantastic with cowboy boots -- and guys love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Philomena Miner fell for a dark green lace-and-net skirt of a prom dress at a 
flea market. A home sewer, she ripped off the boned-to-distraction top, 
replacing it with a simple waistband. She wears the now-long, graceful skirt 
with a black bodysuit or a vintage denim shirt.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miner's got similar plans for the toast-colored lace cocktail dress she just 
bought: "Cut off the top, add a thick sash ribbon at the waist. I'll wear it 
with a flesh-colored bodysuit." Another Miner transformation: a rose-print, 
sequined miniskirt that started life in the 1950s as a frumpy scoop-neck, 
mid-knee dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman-Borsuk takes long, lacy ("lace you could never find today") Victorian 
cotton slips and snips them in half. The good part (ruffly hem, often double 
layered) becomes a miniskirt. They're hot sellers in her shop. 
</P>
<P>
 She will also close the fronts of vintage housecoats (bright Hawaiian or 
floral prints), and turn them into dresses. And once in a while, she finds a 
dress with a great bodice and an unwearable skirt. She cuts it off at the hip 
and turns it into a peplum top to wear with a black miniskirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Wertz of American Rag on La Brea Avenue is always looking for new ways of 
recycling old clothes to appeal to 1990s tastes. One of his best sellers 
combines the bibs of old overalls with skirts from print dresses. In the 
process, he discards the distressed parts of both pieces: the grungy armpits as 
well as battery-acid stained pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cutting off the sleeves vastly improves a lot of dresses," says longtime 
thrift shopper Melissa Hoffs. One of her favorite saves is a blue print dress 
that "looked like a 'Swiss Miss' dress, very little-kiddish with leg o' mutton 
sleeves." Which she lopped off immediately. A few more incisions and repairs 
turned it into a "much simpler" sleeveless shift. Hoffs acknowledges she often 
removes "most of a dress" to make it wearable. 
</P>
<P>
 To supply its four used-clothing stores, Aardvark's Odd Ark has a plant in 
Vernon with 30 sewers who turn muumuus into men's shirts, skirts into short 
shorts, work shirts into halter tops. Prom dresses are turned into crinolines 
as well as pirate shirts for rock performers.

PUTTING THE IRON OUT TO PASTURE? 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cotton commands most of the attention, but it isn't the only fiber using new 
technology to take the wrinkles out of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Feinberg of Mannor Corp. in New York, one of the nation's largest 
manufacturers of men's tailored trousers, says he has pioneered 
wrinkle-resistant, all-worsted wool dress slacks that can be worn year-round. 
Unlike wrinkle-free cottons, he says, these wool trousers are not treated with 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret is in the weave. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Mueller, a product development consultant for the American Wool Council 
in New York, affirms that "good wool slacks don't really wrinkle much, but the 
right wool grade, the right twist of yarn and the right construction of the 
fabric could produce a wrinkle-free wool." 
</P>
<P>
 Tencel, a new eco-friendly manufactured fiber created from wood pulp, used 
alone or in blends with wool or cotton, has anti-wrinkling properties along 
with a soft, drapey touch. David Rose, president of Camden Passage Ltd., 
manufacturer of quality slacks and sport coats, has been selling Tencel blend 
men's slacks since fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And polyester, one of the synthetic fibers that helped propel the original 
wrinkle-free revolution of a generation ago, is back. It is wrapped strand by 
strand with 100% Pima cotton. The wearer never sees or feels the polyester, 
only the soft outer cover of cotton, but can enjoy the benefits of both fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike regular cottons, it doesn't need to be treated with resins to achieve 
its wrinkle-resistance, and it features special thermal capabilities, too. It 
warms the body in cooler temperatures and cools it when the mercury rises. This 
elegant fabric, used in slacks, shorts and shirts, is exclusive to the new 
Nicklaus ProSpin collection of men's golf wear. It's produced by the Trans 
Apparel Group, a subsidiary of Hartmarx Corp. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Nicklaus ProSpin claims, tongue in cheek, that the new 
high-tech fabric is "the best way to play 18 holes without an iron."

MEET THE PRESSED: FUSS-FREE COTTON

 What's the latest wrinkle in fashion? Try all-cotton clothing that claims to 
be wrinkle-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 These casual separates for men and women, including pants, shorts, skirts, 
blazers and shirts, are supposed to come out of the clothes dryer ready to 
wear, no ironing needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what today's busy consumer wants: great-looking clothes without the 
fuss," says Tom Julian, a trend analyst with Fallon McElligott, a Minneapolis 
ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a trend that many manufacturers and stores are rushing to catch up to and 
big-name designers are coolly ignoring. 
</P>
<P>
 How new is it, though? 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and '70s, stores were flooded with permanent-press fashions 
knitted or woven with synthetic fibers such as polyester or nylon, or blends of 
natural fibers and synthetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the leisure suit? 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-'70s, the crisp, clean-cut synthetics were history. It was hip to 
be clad in pure cottons, silks and linens, looking as rumpled as an unmade bed. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, consumer demand triggered development of clothes made of 
natural fiber fabrics that claim to shed wrinkles and are thus easier to care 
for at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the growing numbers of dual-income couples, easy care will play an 
increasingly important role in apparel purchasing decisions," Mike Restaino 
says. Restaino is a buyer for JCPenney Co. Inc., the national retail chain 
based in Dallas. "This product is a major opportunity to respond to the 
lifestyle trends of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Bevel, a menswear buyer at Sears, Roebuck and Co., Chicago, says: 
"Helping to fuel sales of our wrinkle-resistant slacks is the growing influence 
of 'Friday dressing.' Men can wear casual slacks to the office and look good." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Haggar Apparel Co. coined the phrase "wrinkle-free" for the 
line of all-cotton men's slacks it launched with great fanfare and a 
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign. They were a hit, and Haggar now 
claims a major share of the wrinkle-free business in stores around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrinkle-resistant men's slacks were also introduced by major brand names such 
as the Lee Co., Levi's Travelers and Farah's Savane. Wrinkle-resistant casual 
and dress shirts are being ballyhooed by well-known shirt manufacturers 
including Arrow, Oxxford and Van Heusen. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, women's wear manufacturers Eddie Haggar Limited, Chic by HIS, 
Jantzen and Cherokee have produced wrinkle-resistant collections, and kids will 
soon find their own no-iron fashions in stores, too. 
</P>
<P>
 How are wrinkle-resistant all-cotton fabrics created? 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of mumbo jumbo about "secret recipes" and "patent pending 
processes," but, simply, the effect is achieved by using high-tech 
yarn-spinning processes and special weaving or knitting techniques to produce 
fabrics less likely to wrinkle. Next, wrinkle-resistant chemical resins are 
applied to the fabrics, which are then baked or cured in giant ovens. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology is not new. According to Frank Bracken of the Dallas-based 
Haggar Apparel Co., "Permanent pressed cottons have been around 27 years but 
never caught on until now." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is singing praises of the wrinkle-resistant revolution. While 
national retailers such as Macy's, Sears and Penney are successful with the 
wrinkle-resistant styles, specialty stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue won't 
carry them. They say they'll wait until one of the big-name designers 
introduces a wrinkle-shedding collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wrinkle-resistant clothes are geared toward the mass market, and we're not in 
that at all," says Mark Scarborough, vice president of men's design for Joseph 
Abboud. "There's also a trade-off for easy care in the hand -- the feel -- of 
the fabric."

TV RATINGS; 'ROSEANNE' SEASON FINALE TOPS THE COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 NBC thinks "Roseanne" may be vulnerable to attack and has slotted the hit 
comedy "Frasier" against it this fall. But there were no chinks in the armor 
showing last week, as ABC's perennial powerhouse wound up as the most-watched 
show on television with its last original episode of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With five other shows in the Top 10--including the Daytime Emmy Awards--ABC 
handily won the network competition for the fourth week in a row, the A.C. 
Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also making a rare appearance in the Top 10 was a Fox show, in this case the 
season-ending episode of "Beverly Hills, 90210." The two-hour program didn't 
draw quite as high a rating as its season finale last year, but it was Fox's 
best showing since then. And the program did even better locally, finishing 
third among the week's 84 prime-time network programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the highest-rated program here last week wasn't on any of the four 
networks. It was the final episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," on 
KCOP-TV Channel 13, which attracted viewers in nearly 1.2 million 
homes--compared to 1 million for "Roseanne." Southland Ratings

 Here are A.C. Nielsen's Top 10 prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area

FAITHFUL FEW KEEP EYE ON U.S. SOCCER BALL; SPORTS: AVID FANS IN MISSION VIEJO 
DELIGHT IN THEIR PRE-WORLD CUP ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If this were Germany or Brazil, and the national soccer team was training a 
few weeks before playing host to the World Cup, there would be hundreds of fans 
around the practice field, jostling to catch a peek of their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the United States, land of soccer heathens, and Orange County, 
home of fickle fans. So it's no wonder only a handful of spectators were on the 
hill overlooking the U.S. National Training Center recently, watching the U.S. 
team begin its final month of preparation for the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Would players like to see the Mission Viejo facility teeming with fans every 
day? Sure, that would be great for American soccer, long a laggard compared to 
the rest of the world's soccer-worshiping nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those in Orange County who do care about the sport, and for the city 
of Mission Viejo, the U.S. team has been a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every day how lucky I am," said Dan Zaccuri, a 33-year-old Costa Mesa 
construction worker and youth soccer coach. "This is the first time the World 
Cup has come to the U.S., and I can stop in during the middle of the day and 
watch the team practice. There are people around the world who would kill to be 
able to do that, and I do it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Zaccuri knows this is about to change. When the team resumes practice this 
week after a three-game, East-Coast exhibition swing, crowds will likely be 
larger than the dozen or so that have followed recent workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Security will be much tighter around the complex; the number of camera crews, 
reporters and photographers will multiply, and the facility will be closed to 
the public on June 13, four days before the start of the 24-team World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the team, almost completely accessible for the past 17 months, 
will be sequestered at the Dana Point Resort in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zaccuri will always have fond memories of the day his 9-year-old son, 
Roman, met Coach Bora Milutinovic and kicked a ball around with U.S. team 
midfielder Cobi Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Spry, manager of a Ballpark Pizza Team restaurant in Mission Viejo, will 
remember all the U.S. players and coaches who frequented his establishment, 
chatted with customers and signed autographs on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Cain, manager of Hennessey's Tavern in Laguna Beach, will remember the 
night U.S. team defender Alexi Lalas and his band played in his pub. 
</P>
<P>
 And kids from the Santa Ana Boys and Girls Club will remember the day several 
U.S. players put on a free clinic for them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it has been since January, 1993. The U.S. soccer team has 
blended into Orange County, touching the lives of many soccer fans without 
causing so much as a stir among non-fans; putting Mission Viejo back on the 
national and international map without creating a major flap. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the circus atmosphere that accompanies many of the world's great 
national soccer teams, the U.S. team has gone about its business in Mission 
Viejo with virtually no distractions. Nor has it been a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've enjoyed all the benefits from the publicity they've generated without 
the detriments you'd normally associate with having a major team," said Robert 
D. Breton, a Mission Viejo councilman. "There's been no traffic jams (around 
the complex), no loitering, no major crowds to control. It's been completely 
benign." 
</P>
<P>
 Some think too benign. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people in Mission Viejo don't even realize the national team is 
training here," said Petar Vasilev, a 25-year-old salesman who moved from 
Columbus, Ohio, to Orange County six months ago and regularly attends practice. 
"In any other country, people would be fighting for a place to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Some area merchants believe the community got more excited about the 1984 
Olympics, when Mission Viejo was a venue for cycling events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason is because the team hasn't been promoted as well as it could 
have," said Debbie Santoro, community relations director for Bank of Orange 
County, located across the street from the training center. "But they're great 
guys, and we're glad to have them. I think the players have touched a lot of 
kids' lives." 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup fever hasn't exactly gripped the entire Saddleback Valley, but 
there's a bug going around the soccer community. 
</P>
<P>
 Spry turned one wall of his restaurant into a World Cup shrine. The back wall 
in Santoro's bank is covered with soccer paraphernalia. The U.S. team was 
featured in Mission Viejo's St. Patrick's Day parade, and the city named the 
street entering the training facility World Cup Center Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo region of the American Youth Soccer Organization, already 
one of the nation's largest with an average initial April enrollment of 2,600 
to 2,800, had 3,400 sign-ups this April, according to Bill Irvine, AYSO 
scheduler for South County. And many afternoons, kids have hung out at the 
training center, hoping to meet the players and get a few autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're into soccer, there's never been anything like this and there won't 
be again," said Phil Serrins, a Mission Viejo chiropractor. "You have all these 
young men who are the best players in the country. They've gone to ceremonies, 
classrooms, hospitals and put on clinics. They've been totally accessible, 
which has been great for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Serrins, a member of the Mission Viejo Soccer Foundation booster group, was 
responsible for matching U.S. players and support personnel with about 35 host 
families, who helped team members and their families acclimate to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrins' family hosts U.S. goalie Tony Meola, who has spent many days at the 
Serrins house eating home-cooked meals, relaxing and talking soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My 15-year old is a goalie," Serrins said. "It can't hurt to have one of the 
best goalies in the world hanging out with your kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Being a host family also has other privileges, such as meeting Pele when the 
former Brazilian soccer great was at the training facility to film a MasterCard 
commercial last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pele kissed my daughter on the cheek and took a picture with her," Serrins 
said. "That's like me meeting Babe Ruth. She'll remember that for the rest of 
her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Players -- at least the ones who haven't been cut as the team pares its roster 
to the final 22 -- will likely leave Mission Viejo with fond memories, too. For 
them, the training center, which includes a grass field and a clubhouse, has 
provided something no other U.S. national soccer team has ever had -- a 
permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it rained for a few weeks after they arrived in January, 1993, there 
were disastrous fires last fall, and the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake scared 
the cleats off them. 
</P>
<P>
 But all in all, the weather has been very good, and living and training 
conditions have been a major upgrade from the past, when the U.S. roster was a 
team of nomads, assembling a few months before competitions, playing exhibition 
games and living out of suitcases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've definitely experienced everything -- the rains, the fires, the 
earthquake -- but it's been great," said Marcelo Balboa, a U.S. team defender 
since 1988. "In the past, the only time we had a home was when we were on the 
road. Now, we see each other every day, and we're more of a family instead of 
acquaintances. We feel like we're more of a team now." 
</P>
<P>
 The team has grown up together the past year and a half. The wives of three 
players, Peter Vermes, Desmond Armstrong and Janusz Michallik, and one 
assistant coach, Steve Sampson, have had babies since moving to Mission Viejo. 
Meola was married, and defender Mike Lapper and team press officer Dean Linke 
got engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's got divorced since we've been here -- that's good," said Bill 
Nuttall, U.S. team general manager. "We've been able to settle into a 
community, and it's given us a sense of belonging. Hopefully, that will provide 
a benefit for us." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been benefits to the local economy, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nuttall, about $3.5 million in team salaries has been eligible to 
be spent during the team's stay in Orange County. In addition, U.S. team 
officials have written checks totaling $23,000 a month to several apartment 
complexes in the Mission Viejo area to pay for team housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Four players have bought homes in the Saddleback Valley. Players have 
purchased and leased cars and opened bank accounts. The team has bought an 
average of 15 rooms per night at the Laguna Hills Holiday Inn and has had 
numerous receptions, banquets and news luncheons. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants around Cal State Fullerton and Trabuco Hills High School, where 
the team has played exhibitions, have done brisk business. Javier Sosa, who 
owns the Dos Tacos restaurant across the street from the training center, said 
15% to 20% of his business can be attributed to soccer-related customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've had a huge economic impact," said Karen Irvine, press officer for the 
Mission Viejo Soccer Foundation. "It's been a great investment for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team has also been a public relations bonanza for Mission Viejo. 
Linke said media representatives from every country in the World Cup have 
visited the training center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nadadores (swim club) may have put us on the map, but this has given us 
worldwide recognition in the world's most popular sport," Breton said. "To be 
mentioned in articles printed from Hong Kong to Australia to France, Saudi 
Arabia and Germany gives us global recognition we could never purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without fail, everyone I meet immediately tells me, 'I wish I could live 
here.' So I think the ripple effect will extend for many years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo's relationship with World Cup soccer won't last forever. Nuttall 
said the U.S. team is planning to vacate the facility Aug. 31, when their 
contract expires, and there have been reports that the team will move its 
headquarters to Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team will have a lasting effect on Mission Viejo -- primarily in the 
form of the first-class facility that Kelly Doyle, city parks and community 
services director, said will be used for youth and adult soccer after the team 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 As for converting the masses -- or at least raising the interest level in a 
sport that is foreign to most Americans -- the U.S. team's performance in the 
World Cup could go a long way toward determining whether American fans embrace 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the World Cup will open some eyes," said Lalas, the most recognized 
U.S. player because of his wild red hair, straggly goatee and effusive 
personality. "People aren't going to become soccer lunatics, but it will give 
them a greater respect for the game." Orange County and the World Cup 
</P>
<P>
 TOURNAMENT FORMAT 
</P>
<P>
 Number of finalists: 24, including the host U.S. team 
</P>

Vegas in December. Each group will play a round-robin schedule, with standings 
based on three points for a victory and one for a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The second round: The first- and second-place team in each group, plus four 
third-place teams with the most points, qualify for the round of 16, from which 
single-elimination play continues through the championship match July 17 at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. TEAM TRAINING INFORMATION 
</P>
<P>
 Site: U.S. National Training Center, 27301 La Paz Road at World Cup Center, 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrival: Last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Practice: Until June 13, the public can watch workouts from a small rise 
overlooking the practice field. Parking at the training center will be limited 
to those with media, staff and guest credentials; best bet is in the Newhart 
School parking lot when school is not in session or in shopping center 
complexes at Marguerite Parkway and La Paz Road. Practice is generally at 8:30 
a.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and 8 a.m. only on Monday, 
Wednesday and Saturday, but the schedule is subject to change daily because of 
weather and team obligations. As of June 13, cup security will close practices 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Special events: Because of stringent World Cup security measures, there will 
be only one more major social function directly connected to the U.S. team: the 
Black and White Ball, a black-tie optional event June 11 at the Mission Viejo 
Mall. About 1,000 people are expected when the final 22 members of the team are 
introduced. Tickets are $35 and can be obtained by calling (714) 975-8309. 
</P>
<P>
 ROMANIAN TEAM TRAINING INFORMATION 
</P>
<P>
 Site: UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected arrival: Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Practice: The Anteaters' former baseball stadium will be the main training 
site. The facility is enclosed, and it will not be known if spectators will be 
allowed inside until after the team arrives. Depending on security, viewing 
workouts still might be possible from tennis courts situated to the south. As 
with the U.S. team, expect things to tighten up as of June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 COLOMBIAN TEAM TRAINING INFORMATION 
</P>
<P>
 Site: Titan Stadium, Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected arrival: June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Practice: Late arrival would allow little time for spectators, even if they 
were permitted. And that's unlikely. Titan Field has stands that can be secured 
on both sidelines, but end zones are open.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM POLICE IN KING BEATING REJECTED; COURTS: JURY THAT HAD 
AWARDED VICTIM $3.8 MILLION CONCLUDES OFFICERS SHOULD NOT PAY. VERDICT SIGNALS 
THE END OF A DRAMA THAT HAS RACKED L.A. FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signaling an end to one of the most wrenching chapters in Los Angeles history, 
the jury that had awarded Rodney King $3.8 million for his fateful police 
beating decided Wednesday to leave it at that, declining to impose punitive 
damages against the officers who beat him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles federal court panel, which reached its verdict on the 11th day 
of deliberations, found that former LAPD policemen Laurence M. Powell and 
Stacey C. Koon had acted with malice in the 1991 beating of King. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jury concluded that the officers involved in the beating had been 
sufficiently punished and should not be forced to pay King as much as $15 
million more -- a penalty that King's lawyers had sought to deter similar acts 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the racially mixed jury's verdict was unanimous, it was apparent from 
the brief comments of several panelists that it was not reached without 
acrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest indication came from the jury's only African American, who 
served alongside six whites, one Latino and one Filipino American. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no justice here . . . no justice at all," the juror, a South 
Pasadena seamstress, told reporters before driving away. "It's purely black and 
white." 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict offered neither the retribution the King camp had hoped for nor 
the absolution sought by supporters of the police. Indeed, midway through the 
trial, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies removed one of the case's most 
symbolic flash points by dismissing the best known and wealthiest defendant, 
former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the three-man, six-woman jury announced Wednesday afternoon that 
their verdict was reached, reaction -- in and outside the courtroom -- was as 
factionalized and weary as the city that had formed the sprawling backdrop for 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 King was not present during the announcement of the verdict and could not be 
reached for comment. But his lawyers said they were outraged, despite what one 
called the "Solomon-type decision." Lead attorney Milton Grimes said: "How do 
you give a man $3,816,535.45 who was beaten and not consider the badness of the 
beaters?" 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said he is considering an appeal of the decision to remove Gates as a 
defendant. He also said a reported weekend barbecue attended by three jurors 
could form the basis of an appeal if they discussed the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six defendants facing the prospect of having to personally pay damages 
to King, only former Officer Timothy E. Wind was present in court as the 
verdict was read. He later spoke with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a long road I've traveled and I am very pleased with the 
decision," said Wind, who was a probationary police officer at the time of the 
beating and who says he is now destitute and unemployed. "It's taken a chunk 
out of my life, a big chunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Salzman, Koon's attorney, called the verdict "entirely correct," adding 
that police "can now do their job and not fear this vindictive prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's attorney, Michael P. Stone, agreed. "I'm just so happy it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 People throughout Los Angeles agreed that during the past three years the case 
has exacted a heavy toll. The most immediate reaction to the jury's decision -- 
from the streets of South-Central to the police precincts of the San Fernando 
Valley -- was mainly one of relief that the ordeal appears to be finally 
playing itself out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really glad this is over," said Fletcher Jordan, a salesman at a sporting 
goods store at the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. "It's been a long process that 
we've been going through. Everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 But beneath the sense of exhaustion, simmering resentments remained. In 
South-Central, where rioting decimated broad swaths of the city, UCLA student 
Trina White echoed the sentiments of many, saying that "once again, the police 
are getting off scot-free." 
</P>
<P>
 White and others were particularly upset that only taxpayers -- and not police 
officers -- will be paying King for the injuries he sustained. "Once again, the 
buck is being dropped to us and we have to pay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the awarding of substantial punitive damages would have been largely 
symbolic because the officers have few large assets, some felt that the jury 
should have sent a clearer message to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the purpose of punitive damages is to extract a level of 
responsibility from someone who perpetrated an act that was harmful to someone 
else," said Councilwoman Rita Walters. She said she found it "beyond the realm 
of understanding" that the jurors did not require the officers to pay even one 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban League President John Mack said that he believes such a message of 
responsibility was necessary for Koon and Powell. "True, they are serving time, 
but they are doing so without showing any contrition. . . . You can't run 
around brutalizing every African American young man that you encounter." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, many of the city's police officers took bittersweet comfort in 
seeing the defendants escape civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those police officers did what they had to do to go home safe that night, and 
the citizens and the media destroyed this department for it," said Officer Jeff 
Hart of the LAPD's Foothill Division, where the four officers accused in the 
beating were once stationed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Leonard Ross, president of the Oscar Joel Bryant Assn., which represents 
African American police officers, said: 'He (King) got paid, the guys are in 
prison. This trial was just like shooting a dead person." 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict marked the denouement of a drama that has racked Los Angeles for 
more than three years. The grainy, videotaped image of the white policemen 
clubbing the cowering black motorist, aired first by a local television 
station, forced the city to confront long-simmering racial tensions and set the 
stage for the worst urban riots in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that ensued, Los Angeles got a new mayor and a new police chief. 
The city's government underwent seismic shifts. And the lives of those involved 
on that traffic stop in Lake View Terrace would never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The King case prompted two criminal trials, one state and the other federal. 
The first yielded not guilty verdicts for the officers involved, triggering 
riots in which at least 53 people were killed. The second ended with the 
convictions of Koon and Powell for violating King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, two months ago, a third trial began, as King brought a civil suit 
against the city for monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of Wednesday's verdict, all four officers charged initially were 
unemployed, and King -- a high school dropout and ex-con -- was a household 
name and a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the court proceedings before it, the civil trial shed little light on the 
particulars of the beating. But it offered a glimpse of the havoc wrought by 
the incident's aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil case was essentially a two-phase process in which King asked first 
for compensation for medical bills, pain and suffering and then for punitive 
assessments against the individual officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase ended with an order from the jury that the city pay King $3.8 
million in compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second part of the trial involved the much thornier issue of 
punishment for the individual officers. Jurors, who were able to use testimony 
from both phases of the trial, evaluated whether present and former officers 
used unreasonable force or acted in reckless disregard for King's 
constitutional rights, then determined whether those officers should have to 
compensate King from their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lawyers had asked the jury to award between $3.8 million and $15 
million in punitive damages from Koon, Powell, Wind, former Officer Theodore J. 
Briseno and current Officers Rolando Solano and Louis Turriaga. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind kicked and hit King with a baton; Briseno stomped him. Turriaga was 
accused of stepping on King while trying to handcuff him, and then he and 
Solano dragged King on the asphalt while moving him off the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for defendants Koon, Powell, Wind and Briseno -- the defendants 
in the state trial -- argued that they are now impoverished and have suffered 
enough. Koon and Powell are serving 30 months in prison. Wind, a rookie 
probationary officer, was dismissed from the department, and Briseno was 
suspended from the force and is trying to get his job back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The officers have been victimized just like Rodney King," said Salzman, 
attorney for Koon, who was the supervisor in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In court testimony, the officers detailed their suffering. They were outcasts 
among their peers, they told the jury; their careers and homes and life savings 
were gone. Koon and Powell said they now work for 12 cents an hour in prison to 
pay for their personal necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind's wife broke down in tears on the stand when she described the toll the 
case has taken on her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno took the rare step of countersuing King for a share of the award, 
arguing that King shoved him in the chest before the beating. The jury 
Wednesday agreed that Briseno had been struck but awarded him no damages. 
</P>
<P>
 To the end, the majority of the officers were unrepentant, saying they had 
acted within police procedure in their treatment of King. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon, wearing a prison-issue blue uniform and plastic sandals, reiterated his 
claim that he "tased" King and ordered others to beat the motorist because he 
was resisting arrest and appeared to be under the influence of PCP. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I didn't do anything wrong," Koon said. "I acted in good faith. I've 
taken full responsibility and accountability for my actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said he struck King numerous times with his metal baton because he 
feared for his safety, and because he was following Koon's orders. 
</P>
<P>
 When Powell was asked whether he thought he had done anything wrong, he 
snapped: "I not only don't think it, I know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Only Briseno has expressed remorse at the incident -- a move that he said has 
made him a pariah among some police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For three years, I've put up with this, and it hurts," he said. "I look over 
at Larry and Stacey and I think, 'Is it only me that's admitted something wrong 
happened out there?' " 
</P>
<P>
 King admitted that he had had too much to drink that night and said he 
panicked when police began following his car because he was a parolee and did 
not want to go back to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Disputing testimony from police who said that King led officers on a long 
chase, King said he tried to elude the patrol car for about 12 blocks, before 
deciding that it made little sense to run. King's lawyers said he tried to 
follow orders until one of the officers taunted him with racial slurs and told 
him to run for his life. When he tried to run, he said, he was savagely beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just so scared. I felt like I was going to die," King said on the 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers hogtied and dragged him to the side of the road, "I felt like a 
cow that was waiting to be slaughtered, like a piece of meat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorneys argued that such treatment was business as usual for the 
LAPD, particularly against minorities. They introduced evidence from the 
Christopher Commission report to show that Gates was ultimately responsible for 
racism by the officers under his command. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davies dismissed Gates as a defendant, shocking King's lawyers. The judge 
said King's lawyers had failed to show that Gates should be held accountable 
for the beating. The controversial police chief retired in 1992 after the 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad management is not enough," Davies said. "Allowing racism is not enough. 
Poor supervision is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision took away the most affluent defendant in the case, 
leaving King with only the "little fish," said one of his attorneys. The 
original list of 15 defendants was eventually whittled down to six, with no one 
above the rank of Koon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the incident, King has chalked up $200,000 in medical expenses for 
injuries including facial and leg fractures. He said he still suffers from 
flashbacks, dizziness, blurred vision and numbness in his face from multiple 
baton blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys said King brought many of his problems on himself, and they 
dug into his records to show that he was a troublemaker in school and a 
delinquent at an early age. They told the jury that he tested positive for 
drugs and had several run-ins with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 King has tried to turn his life around, his lawyers said, by seeking his high 
school diploma and spending more time with his wife and children. But wherever 
he goes, they say, he is constantly reminded of the beating. He wears a 
bulletproof vest and is accompanied by security guards -- even to his son's 
Little League games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm a walking target," he told the jury.

SALVADOR CHIEF SWORN IN AMID FEARS FOR PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armando Calderon Sol, leader of a right-wing political party once associated 
with death squads, was sworn in as president of El Salvador on Wednesday amid 
warnings that reforms aimed at preserving this country's fledgling peace are 
dangerously incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first president to take office since the end of a brutal, 12-year civil 
war, Calderon Sol pledged to rebuild his devastated, still polarized country 
with free-market economics and attention to long-neglected social programs. But 
he acknowledged that Salvadoran society is far from reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have achieved peace, the guns are silent," he said in an elaborate 
ceremony before Central America's leaders and dozens of international 
delegations. "But we have yet to shatter the suspicions and sterile 
antagonisms. We must rebuild our nation physically, morally and spiritually so 
that we can together achieve social peace." 
</P>
<P>
 This was El Salvador's first peacetime transfer of power between civilians in 
more than six decades. Calderon Sol assumes office a year and a half after 
U.N.-brokered accords ended the war between Cuban-backed leftist guerrillas and 
U.S.-backed forces. The war claimed more than 70,000 lives and sent 1 million 
Salvadorans fleeing to Los Angeles, Washington and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol, the portly 45-year-old former mayor of San Salvador and an 
original member of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, was 
elected April 24 in a landslide over leftist candidate Ruben Zamora, who 
represented a coalition that included the former rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. accords set in motion sweeping military, political and judicial 
reforms aimed at installing democracy and guaranteeing all Salvadorans' 
security. The government succeeded in substantially reducing the army, but some 
of the most important reforms have not been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report issued May 11, the United Nations cited "serious shortcomings" in 
completing the accords and emphasized flaws in the formation of a new civilian 
police force, considered the cornerstone to maintaining peace and building a 
system of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The report complained that the "civilian nature" of the new police force is in 
jeopardy because agents from the old, paramilitary National Police have been 
phased into the new agency without proper training or screening to eliminate 
human rights abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government of outgoing President Alfredo Cristiani, also a member of 
Calderon Sol's Arena party, has repeatedly delayed demobilizing the dreaded 
paramilitary police. It recently indicated it would not do so until sometime 
between January and March of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. report also complained that 30 senior positions in the civilian 
police force have gone to officers from the militarized force and that reports 
of human rights abuses have increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol has publicly attacked several reforms in the peace accords. But 
since his election in April, and again on Wednesday, he insisted he would abide 
by them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say you have to give him the benefit of the doubt -- it's his first day," 
Joaquin Villalobos, a former guerrilla commander who now heads a social 
democratic party, said as he emerged from the inauguration. "But we will have 
to see how much distance there is between words and actions." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of the police and public security is especially urgent because of 
renewed violence, some of it political, that has claimed the lives of former 
rebels and several Arena militants in recent months. Amid fears of a resurgence 
of death squads, U.N. peacekeepers late last year appointed a special 
commission, the Joint Group, to investigate the violence over a six-month 
period ending this week. On Tuesday, the commission asked for a two-month 
extension, after a flurry of killings and attempted slayings in the last two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his party's history as an authoritarian and militaristic organization, 
Calderon Sol has taken pains to assure the world that he and the forces around 
him have become more moderate. "The era of dogmas and fanaticisms has ended," 
Calderon Sol said Wednesday, apparently referring to both the left and right. 
</P>
<P>
 Arena officials say they have abandoned their extremist past to move closer to 
the center and to broaden their appeal. Key to a more pragmatic outlook, the 
officials say, is the growing role of Arena's business sector. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new president and most Arena leaders continue to revere the late 
Roberto D'Aubuisson, party founder and reputed organizer of death squads that 
killed thousands of suspected leftist sympathizers during the war. In the 
highly partisan crowd at Calderon Sol's inauguration, supporters held aloft a 
larger-than-life poster of D'Aubuisson in his trademark, clenched-fist pose. 
And several military officers purged as part of the peace accords were in 
attendance, including retired Gens. Rene Emilio Ponce and Orlando Zepeda; they 
were accused of ordering the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests considered 
supportive of the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new president and the people around him are using all the right words 
(about democracy), but I don't think they know what the words mean," a Latin 
American diplomat said. "Arena is still very influenced by hard-line elements. 
You won't see them in government, but they're there." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 45-minute inaugural speech -- witnessed by Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott, who represented the United States, which spent an estimated $6 
billion to shore up Salvadoran governments and the army -- Calderon Sol called 
for "constructive opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 But in many ways, he will be able to govern with a free hand because the 
leftist opposition has fallen into disarray. Arena won most of the seats in 
flawed National Assembly elections in March. More important, the former 
guerrillas, who formed a political party as part of the accords, have exploded 
into bitter, public disputes over direction and tactics. A permanent rupture 
may be on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of an effective opposition has compounded fears among some 
Salvadorans that Calderon Sol will be able to disregard the peace accord 
reforms if he so chooses. "There are no checks, there are no balances," said 
Gerardo LeChevallier, a senior official of the centrist Christian Democratic 
Party.

POLICE UNION REJECTS MAYOR'S MEDIATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holding onto a critical bargaining chip -- the World Cup games -- the union 
for disgruntled Los Angeles police officers Wednesday rejected Mayor Richard 
Riordan's proposal to bring in an outside mediator to help settle their labor 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Protective League's action was a gamble. It prompted the city to 
immediately declare an impasse, which ultimately could allow the city to impose 
the contract it wants. But union leaders needed to take the chance to stay in 
step with their membership -- an increasingly militant group that has already 
ousted one team of negotiators that it felt was not tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
 A job action during the upcoming soccer tournament is unlikely to paralyze the 
massive security effort: The LAPD can easily force its officers to work during 
the World Cup by declaring a tactical alert. But staging something similar to 
the "blue flu II" sickout -- which ended Wednesday -- would cost the city 
millions of dollars in overtime. And officers could still embarrass the city by 
publicizing their cause while Los Angeles is in the world's eye, union 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have the world's media here and a whole lot of disgruntled 
cops," said union spokesman Geoffrey Garfield. "If any incident breaks out, we 
can say, 'We told you so -- public safety is important.' That will make our 
argument for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The union's order that members refuse voluntary overtime during the World Cup 
games has stirred some concern among neighboring law enforcement agencies, 
which have spent more than a year working with the LAPD on plans for the 
tournament, which begins June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have some very important policing functions to perform," said Capt. Dan 
Burt, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "This is 
going to be a monumental undertaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the games will be played in Pasadena's Rose Bowl, outside Los Angeles 
city limits, the LAPD is responsible for a number of duties, such as guarding 
dignitaries and tourists who stay in or travel through Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly hope that any dispute would be resolved by the time the games 
begin," said World Cup spokesman Toby Zwikel. "(But) World Cup definitely has a 
very thorough security plan that will be in place. The public should be assured 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officials say that although officers can refuse voluntary overtime, they 
cannot disobey a direct order to work overtime. That would constitute 
insubordination and would almost certainly result in dismissal from the force. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposed voluntary overtime boycott would not affect any issues of 
public safety," Cmdr. David J. Gascon said. "If I'm a commander and I say I 
need somebody, I'm going to get them." 
</P>
<P>
 Police ended their three-day blue flu Wednesday morning, when 226 out of 458 
officers on the morning watch called in sick. But they continued their campaign 
for a raise by protesting en masse at an evening speech by Riordan before a 
group of Hancock Park homeowners at the Wilshire Ebell Theater. Hundreds of 
officers carried picket signs and handed out flyers asking for the public's 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 When Riordan tried to speak, officers booed and angrily shouted him down. The 
mayor, who became frazzled at times, shouted his message above the din and 
ended by calling the Police Department "the greatest in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Riordan said he took the police demonstration in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that the officers were venting their anger and frustration," he said. 
"I didn't take it personally -- I feel like I'm their partner and ally." 
</P>
<P>
 To counter the city's suggestion that a non-binding mediator be appointed, the 
union insisted on binding arbitration. The city rejected that. The resulting 
stalemate prompted the city to declare an impasse, an action that could give 
the city the authority to impose a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Police Protective League has tangled with the city in the current 
contract talks, it has veered back and forth between confrontation and 
conciliation -- partly in an attempt by league leaders to stay close to what 
they believe their membership wants. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, insistent that the city has more money hidden in its coffers, 
argued that non-binding mediation was a delaying tactic to take away the 
union's most potent threat -- a job action during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 That, they feared, could have alienated their already angry troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, the last time officers were locked in a contract dispute 
with the city, a mediator sided with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for the membership to know we're not selling them out," said 
union President Danny Staggs. "If this city is forcing something on the 
membership, then the bad guys are the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's labor relations rules give it an advantage over unions in 
negotiations. If talks ultimately fail to settle a dispute, the city has the 
final word. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has opposed binding arbitration -- in which an impartial outsider 
would unilaterally resolve the dispute -- because it takes too much control 
away from its negotiators. The mediator that the city wanted would have been 
strictly advisory. 
</P>
<P>
 Before an impasse becomes final, the city is required to hold a final meeting 
with the union and notify the state. Then the state can order a mediator 
brought in or a formal fact-finding proceeding in which the two sides argue 
their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the city can decide whether it wishes to follow the resulting 
recommendation or impose a different contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs said it would be unwise for city officials to force a contract on 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers have shown that they are so frustrated that they will act even 
without the union, Staggs said. There was widespread participation in this 
week's unauthorized blue flu. Earlier, officers overwhelmingly rejected a 
contract proposal that the union leadership brokered with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 That deal called for a 6% pay raise over the next two years. Among other 
things, officers have insisted on retroactive pay for the two years that they 
have worked without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The union leadership is well aware of the perils of alienating its members. In 
1978, union leaders endorsed Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. for governor, and they 
were swept from office by outraged police officers. The blistering reaction to 
that endorsement has made the league much more cautious in recent elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Zeigler, a league director who served as president last year, pushed for 
the blue flu in November. But when a judge halted that protest after one day 
and it did not produce a contract, Zeigler was replaced by Staggs, who was 
perceived as a City Hall player who might be able to deliver where Zeigler 
could not. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs has now come under attack himself, the subject of an ongoing recall 
effort by officers.

COLUMN ONE; NEW LIFE FOR NOTORIOUS HIGH-RISES?; FORCEFUL HOUSING CHIEF SAYS HE 
CAN RESURRECT CHICAGO'S CABRINI-GREEN PROJECT. VINCENT LANE MUST WIN OVER MANY 
DOUBTERS, INCLUDING WARY TENANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cabrini-Green projects tower over the northern edge of downtown like a 
high-rise graveyard, a monument to the futility of three decades of public 
housing policy and the hopelessness of all who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Lane, the man who runs these skyline eyesores of mottled cinder-block 
and security fencing, comes here often on a mission that many Cabrini tenants 
regard as a fool's errand. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, the chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority, imagines garden 
apartments where they see exhausted dormitories, some sealed with plywood. He 
sees ceiling fans and wrought-iron gates where residents endure crippled 
elevators that force them to commute up to 19 flights of stairs inside their 
own homes. He sees courtyards filled with children at play where they spy 
huddled gang members, pistols bulging under their shirttails. 
</P>
<P>
 A real-estate millionaire who administers Chicago's 155 high-rise projects, 
Lane intends to resurrect Cabrini, a symbol of "all that's bad in public 
housing," to prove that the nation's largest and most infamous system of public 
housing can be redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can raise families in high-rises," he preaches to wealthy architects at 
wine-and-cheese receptions and to rows of murmuring Cabrini residents jammed 
inside drafty commons meeting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane puts his faith in "income mixing" -- the experimental replacing of many 
low-income project residents with working- and middle-class families. Lured by 
low rents and the higher safety and maintenance standards, the new tenants are 
expected to provide a human safety net for their poor neighbors, acting as role 
models and helping them find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A natural-born salesman in Italian-tailored suits, Lane has spent the last 
year trying to sell the dream that Cabrini, a 70-acre cement moonscape bordered 
by freeway ramps and railroad spurs, might someday become a functioning, 
livable community. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrini's progress is being closely watched by federal housing officials who 
are turning away from 30 years of government control that once shunted only the 
hard-core poor into projects. Those regulations, social policy planners now 
concede, helped create uncontrollable city-states of the underclass. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite $50 million in federal seed money, Lane's $350-million project is 
still in its infancy, months away from breaking ground. Before tenants can be 
moved and buildings razed, Lane must secure financial commitments from 
developers and business leaders, loans and legislative support from politicians 
and government-mandated approvals from Cabrini's tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 A blunt, genial Mississippi native, Lane, 51, commutes between Washington and 
Chicago to nudge his dream along. Even in its earliest stages, the Cabrini plan 
is generating excitement among housing planners as one of the most ambitious 
efforts to transform high-rise projects since their creation in the 1950s. If 
it succeeds, Cabrini could become a model for change in massive projects 
throughout America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a concept that's long overdue and really brings us back to what public 
housing was supposed to do in the first place," said Margery Austin Turner, a 
housing analyst with the Urban Institute in Washington. "These big high-rise 
projects not only segregate the poor from the rest of the world, they also have 
a destabilizing influence on the neighborhoods around them." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 city housing agencies recently embraced income mixing in 
applications for grants to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
-- though only Lane's bases the future of an entire complex on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, which has no high-rise projects, is concentrating on reducing the 
sprawl of its Pico-Aliso projects just east of downtown. Unlike poorer projects 
like Jordan Downs and Nickerson Gardens, Pico-Aliso already mixes poor and 
working families, a HUD official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Income mixing was common once in the nation's projects, before stringent 
federal rent rules made it economically ruinous for working families to remain 
there. Lane recalls growing up in the 1950s near Wentworth Gardens, a South 
Side Chicago project, amid "green lawns and working families with both parents 
living at home." 
</P>
<P>
 That world is gone, but Lane insists "we can fine-tune it to fit a new era." 
</P>
<P>
 His fledgling Cabrini project -- which would tear down seven high-rises -- 
would be the first phase of a metamorphosis that could run into the billions 
and last a decade or more. Lane hopes to keep whittling the number of Cabrini's 
91 buildings, erect market-rate apartments and shrink the ranks of its 7,000 
poor tenants to only 25% of the project's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Those left out would be resettled -- "willingly," Lane insists -- in 
subsidized rental units and new government homes built elsewhere in Chicago and 
its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrini's population is now overwhelmingly poor and without resources. More 
than 70% of its households pay less than $100 a month in rent. At least 63% are 
female and 43% are school-age children. All but 2% are African American. And 
90% are on public assistance -- well below Chicago Housing Authority 
requirements that a family of four make no more than $23,450 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Cabrini's own poor who are most suspicious of Lane's intentions, and not 
without reason. They fear a land grab. Many are convinced that Cabrini -- less 
than a mile from high-rent lake-shore condos and stores catering to the 
affluent -- is coveted by developers. 
</P>
<P>
 They worry that they will be displaced into perhaps worse housing at higher 
rents. And they bridle at the prospect of having to leave apartments where some 
families have lived for three generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been getting the shaft for years and we want to be damn sure we're not 
going to get it again," said Josephine Trotter, who has lived at Cabrini 15 
years and is on the project's Resident Advisory Council, the tenants' 
negotiating group. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have their own nickname for Lane, perhaps Chicago's most 
recognized African American official other than U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun. 
They call him "Daddy Lane" -- both a tribute to his no-nonsense ability to get 
things done and a taunt at what some perceive as his highhanded methods of 
dealing with their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane has run Chicago's housing since 1988 as an appointee of the mayor and 
City Council. He juggles his post -- at a salary of $1 a year -- with private 
interests in subsidized housing units scattered outside Chicago through the 
Midwest and East. He is well aware that Cabrini's poor are his toughest sales 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who live there know they didn't create (Cabrini's) lousy 
environment," he said. "The System put them there and now they're afraid the 
System wants their land again. They're afraid the System will tear everything 
down and move them out to Argo or Kankakee, where there are no jobs or 
transportation and they'll have to survive in environments where at best 
they're ignored and at worst they're hated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to be patient and convince them that won't happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane became one of the nation's most visible housing directors when he tamed 
the rampant administrative chaos that almost led HUD to seize control of 
Chicago's housing system in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hailed by former Republican HUD Secretary Jack Kemp for the crime 
sweeps he repeatedly ordered in Chicago projects. His name was bandied about as 
Kemp's replacement until President Clinton chose former San Antonio Mayor Henry 
G. Cisneros. In April, Clinton hoisted Lane's profile even higher by ordering 
federal officials to find legal underpinnings to back his warrantless weapons 
searches in the Robert Taylor Homes, a 28-block stretch of high-rises lining 
the Dan Ryan Expressway on the city's South Side. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime control will be essential at Cabrini, Lane says, because "I won't be 
able to persuade working families to move in unless they feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of 7-year-old Dantrell Davis, killed in 1992 by a sniper's bullet 
in a Cabrini courtyard, helped focus Lane on Cabrini. The raids he tried 
earlier this year in the Taylor homes -- halted by a federal court judge -- 
were first used last year in Cabrini after the youth's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrini was not always a place of dread. It was started in 1942, replacing 
blocks of slum housing. The first high-rises came in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the 1960s, Cabrini and the rest of the nation's high-rise projects 
metastasized like rogue cancer cells. Federal directives that continued into 
the Bush years forced employed project tenants to pay higher rents than their 
jobless counterparts, eventually driving most into cheaper, privately owned 
apartments and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of social activists thought they were doing good by finding more 
housing for the poor. What they didn't see was the long-term impact of 
segregating them from the rest of society," said Mary Ann Ross, executive 
director of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, nonprofit and state-financed developers in Massachusetts and a 
few other states began going against that tide, experimenting with income mixes 
to attract both poor and working tenants to new housing sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "They realized it didn't make sense to fill their development with only the 
poor," said Michael Stegman, HUD's assistant secretary for policy development, 
who studied those efforts as an urban policy professor at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Stegman said HUD's new administrators plan to make income mixing a high 
priority in all new developments. "We're doing all we can now to encourage 
mixing," he said. "This is the future." 
</P>
<P>
 James Rosenbaum, a professor at Northwestern University's Center for Urban 
Affairs, believes poor residents will benefit from living among higher-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For 10 years, Rosenbaum monitored Chicago's Gautreaux Program, a federal 
court-mandated effort that assisted 5,000 poor families in finding integrated 
housing. Although Gautreaux's poor moved into more affluent areas -- the 
reverse of the process Lane seeks at Cabrini -- the results, Rosenbaum says, 
may well be identical. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 46% of those who had no jobs when they lived in public housing and 
tenement units found work after moving to the suburbs, Rosenbaum found. That 
number compared to 30% who moved to other city housing. And those who moved to 
the suburbs also won better pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to turn Cabrini-Green into a suburban paradise overnight," 
Rosenbaum said. "But I think the kind of mixed-income environment Lane is 
talking about -- working-class families becoming role models for the poor -- 
can grow at Cabrini. He's already made that point at Lake Parc." 
</P>
<P>
 Once known as the Olander Homes, Lake Parc Place is the mannered title Lane 
gave to twin red-brick towers that loom over Lake Michigan on the South Side. 
Until the 1980s, they could have been any dispirited city high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall lights were routinely smashed. The stairs smelled of urine. The buildings 
were patrolled by members of the El Rukns, the most notorious narcotics gang in 
Illinois until federal prosecutions shut them down in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the buildings in 1986, Lane used a $14-million HUD grant to erect a 
black wrought-iron fence and install wading pools and shrub-trimmed play areas. 
He spent $60,000 per apartment on pastel-colored paints, oak cabinets and 
mini-blinds, among other refurbishments. Then he welcomed back tenants with a 
rigid screening policy, weeding out troublemakers and addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of Lake Parc's 282 units were earmarked for working families -- a ratio 
that the buildings have maintained since they opened in August, 1991. When 
social worker Steve Mason, 27, went searching two years ago for a new home with 
his wife and two children, he assumed Lake Parc was "just a nice apartment 
building." 
</P>
<P>
 When he found out it was public housing, he moved in anyway. Life was not 
idyllic, Mason said, but "no worse than any other private apartment house. 
Here, you can tell someone to cut the noise or pick up the trash and you don't 
get a middle finger or a gun in your face." 
</P>
<P>
 Mason has even found his ideals rubbing off on his poorer neighbors. "I've 
asked kids to pick up their candy wrappers in the elevators and they do it, no 
questions asked," Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor, too, have found benefits. Georgia Caldwell, an original Olander Park 
tenant, was transfixed by the sound of early morning showers. "When I first got 
here it took me awhile to figure out what that was," she said. "All these 
people were getting ready for work. I never used to hear that sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Caldwell, too, showers early. Once a welfare mother with two daughters, 
she has found work as a Lake Parc guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these tributes, Lane's plans to expand the experiment by building 564 
new low-rise housing units nearby have been stalled by financial and regulatory 
problems -- chief among them HUD's reluctance to allow Lane to divert $118 
million in federal renovation funds for use in new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not only housing bureaucrats Lane needs to court these days. He must 
still win over Cabrini residents suspicious about his plans to transform their 
buildings. Lane and his Housing Authority aides return repeatedly to Cabrini, 
enduring scoldings, taking temperatures, dickering with tenant leaders, trying 
to keep the project on course. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Housing Authority staffers have herded Cabrini residents into buses 
and put them up at suburban hotels for weekend bull sessions. They have set up 
committees to iron out the worrisome details of who will stay and who will go. 
They have even taken a handful of leaders to Washington, squiring them around 
to meet federal officials and housing experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with those perquisites, the negotiations have stalled at times over 
semantics, teetering on the smoldering resentment of Cabrini tenants embittered 
by Lane's blunt insistence that they are part of Cabrini's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 During one acid exchange, residents demanded that Lane stop using the word 
poor to describe them. Recalls Lane: "I said: 'Look. We can spend all our time 
trying to come up with nice-sounding phrases, but when the average incomes at 
Cabrini are $2,400 a year, I don't know any other way to describe you but 
poor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Josephine Trotter, who at one point approached a Legal Aid lawyer to see if a 
lawsuit might slow the Cabrini steamroller, said that lately "we're starting to 
compromise. When he (Lane) wants to, he can be very accommodating." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that recent progress, all Lane has for certain these days is his 
$50-million federal grant -- and even that did not come easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, he was stunned when HUD declined to give the Cabrini project any 
funding under a $300-million housing grant program known as Hope VI. Three 
months later, after Lane's fevered lobbying revived the award, it nearly died 
again when two Chicago-area House members, Bobby L. Rush and Cardiss Collins, 
demanded their own review. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vince likes to think he is the U.S. Housing Department, and there are days 
when he may not be wrong," said one federal official. "But there are a lot of 
mouths to feed in this process -- a lot of people who want to play a part -- 
and sometimes he forgets that." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, though, Lane plays the process like a virtuoso violinist. 
His nights are booked with speeches to Chicago's power-brokers and business 
groups. Armed with brochure-style slides of his resurrection of Lake Parc 
Place, Lane tells rapt audiences that Cabrini will be next. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to win a popularity contest," Lane said. "I'm here to try to 
make poor peoples' lives better. If you really want to do that, you can't keep 
everybody happy all the time. No matter how hard you try."

ALLOCATION OF SCHOOL FUNDS SPURS COMPETING DEMANDS; EDUCATION: L.A. WILL HAVE 
TO SPEND ABOUT THE SAME ON EACH STUDENT. BUT THERE IS A TUG OF WAR OVER 
PRIORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the Los Angeles Unified School District embarks on a new way of funding its 
650 schools, it finds itself stumbling over the most basic of questions: How 
much does it cost to educate a child? 
</P>
<P>
 To find the answer, officials must first decide whether to spend more money on 
students at campuses with high overhead; whether high schools, with their 
costly labs and athletic programs, should command more money per child than 
elementary schools, and who should pay to bus students across town when their 
neighborhood campuses are full? 
</P>
<P>
 And, more immediately, who should get the bill for the expensive special 
services needed by disabled students? Should the cost be allowed to swamp a 
small neighborhood school or be shared by all campuses, even those without 
disabled students? 
</P>
<P>
 These issues are being raised by a court order that will soon require each Los 
Angeles school to spend about the same amount of money per student. That push 
toward equality comes as the public is clamoring to give schools more budget 
autonomy, leaving district officials struggling to produce a funding plan that 
reconciles those competing demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever course the district charts will inevitably make some schools winners 
and others losers. The winners will have more money to reduce class size or add 
subjects such as music and art; the losers will be forced to economize by 
hiring less-experienced teachers or cutting programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This budget thing is a lot more complicated than people think," said John 
Perez, vice president of the teachers union, which is monitoring the funding 
deliberations. "It's not just give every school the money that is generated by 
that school, because then who pays for the transportation system, who pays for 
the police, who pays for special ed?" 
</P>
<P>
 The state sends every school district a base amount of money for each student 
who attends; this year Los Angeles Unified received $3,200 per pupil. But only 
a tiny portion -- primarily for classroom supplies and teachers aides -- is 
controlled by the schools. The district uses the rest to pay for such campus 
necessities as teacher salaries, utility costs and maintenance services. 
</P>
<P>
 But three factors have converged to render that funding system obsolete. A 
1992 settlement in the Rodriguez lawsuit, which accused the district of 
spending less on inner-city campuses than on suburban ones, requires that 
per-student spending be equalized by 1996. Reform is giving principals, 
teachers and parents more authority over their schools' budgets. And the 
growing "charter" movement is allowing schools independence from the district's 
cumbersome accounting rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles district uses so many accounts to keep track of its 
$3.9-billion budget that it cannot calculate actual per-student spending for 
every school. The best it can do is an average by type -- $2,806 per student at 
elementary schools, $3,422 at middle schools, and $3,545 at high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 From each student's share, about $400 is subtracted to help pay the district's 
portion of expensive special education and integration services. And it is the 
bill for those programs -- particularly special education -- that poses the 
first challenge to educators trying to sort out new principles of school 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a philosophical kind of issue," special education administrator Steven 
Mark said. "Some (school officials) think we should all pay a share, and others 
say they are not willing to pay for everybody, just their own kids." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the $212 million the Los Angeles district must take from school 
funds each year for integration programs and services for disabled children -- 
everything from specially equipped school buses to extra teachers and aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, those costs have been spread equally among all the district's 
schools, even though special education and integration programs are offered on 
only a fraction of the district's campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state does not provide us with enough money for those programs, so if we 
didn't (make all schools) share the costs, you might free up money for some 
schools, but you would end up bankrupting other schools, such as those with a 
high concentration of special education students," district budget chief Henry 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vaughn Learning Center in Pacoima became the first district school to 
take total control of its finances last year, school director Yvonne Chan 
demanded that it be exempted from contributing to the special education fund 
and, instead, pay only the actual costs of teaching disabled students at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan also contended that as an independent charter school, Vaughn should get 
the full $3,186 per child that the district gets from the state -- giving it 
$800 per student more than other elementary schools receive. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials initially insisted that Vaughn play by the same rules as 
regular schools and contribute its share of districtwide costs. But after 
months of haggling, the school board relented and agreed to withhold nothing 
for special education and other central services, and to give Vaughn an extra 
$149,000, which put its per-pupil funding close to the $3,186 Chan had sought. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Chan agreed to pay for services for the 54 disabled students on 
campus. That made Vaughn the first Los Angeles school to be freed of its 
financial obligation to the district's expensive special education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Some school board members say they were intimidated by San Fernando Valley 
politicians into giving Vaughn a bigger pot of money than other elementary 
schools, and they worry that their decision set the district on a course that 
cannot be sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we drifted into giving them special treatment because of political 
pressure," said Jeff Horton, who voted for the arrangement. "We wanted them to 
succeed, but we may have set a precedent that will be harder to undo than we 
realize, and we can't afford to extend it to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Letting Vaughn opt out of the special education pool this year had little 
districtwide impact because there are more than 600 schools to absorb Vaughn's 
portion. But if that policy were extended to other schools, the pot of special 
education funds could quickly be depleted. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every school offers some services for students with mild disabilities, 
but special classes for severely disabled children are concentrated in only a 
handful of campuses throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Because students are bused to those campuses from around the district, 
allowing each school to pay only its own way, as Vaughn does, "becomes an issue 
with great implications," Mark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fine to say let each school pay for its own kids, but who are its own 
kids?" he said. "What about kids who are from that area but go to another 
school? Which school pays for them?" 
</P>
<P>
 The same question dogs the debate over how to distribute the district's 
integration costs. More than 56,000 students are being bused this year to 
magnet and other integration programs. The state pays 80% of the bill, but the 
remaining $33 million is divided equally among all students. 
</P>
<P>
 If each school had to pay its own tab for busing, schools such as Taft High in 
Woodland Hills -- where more than one-third of the 2,850 pupils are bused in -- 
would take staggering hits on their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Leticia Quezada said the school board is struggling to decide 
how to apportion the costs of educating its children -- and to discern exactly 
how much it costs for each student. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, there are some responsibilities that the entire district has 
to respond to . . . and how we divide the cost is what we have to decide," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 16, the board took its first step toward a new budgeting system, 
approving a pilot plan to give schools in the district's reform program the 
right to decide how to spend some of the money set aside for staffing their 
campuses and buying classroom equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board deferred a decision on the question of funding special education 
programs, as well as other sticky issues, such as whether elementary and high 
schools should be funded at the same level and whether small schools should 
receive more than large schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary school principals argue that their student spending should not 
suffer to subsidize high schools, which have more expensive programs but also 
have larger student enrollments to generate more revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 And small schools, which must spend a larger portion of their budget on fixed 
costs, are lobbying for extra funding to keep their classroom spending on a par 
with the larger, more economical campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools would fare well under a plan allowing them to pay only for the 
services needed by disabled children on their campuses. Vaughn saved $120,000 
this year by not paying into the special education pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The school spent $180,000 to hire additional teachers, aides and a recreation 
director to work with disabled students. Had it paid its per-student assessment 
to the district, it would have cost Vaughn $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But by opting out of the district fund, Vaughn shifted more of the cost of 
special education onto other campuses. In effect, the decision burdened schools 
such as nearby Chandler Elementary in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 With three classrooms of children in wheelchairs and on respirators, Chandler 
would find its budget devastated by the kind of pay-your-own-way policy that 
produced a windfall at Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the scramble for local control, each school is campaigning for the 
funding solution that best fits its needs, district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if I'm a school that has only two special ed kids, I only want to 
pay for those two. But a school down the street that has 100 special ed kids 
would not be able to pay for those in their budget," Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the local school level, everybody wants the kind of flexibility Vaughn 
has, as long as that doesn't work against their interests. Then they start 
backing off." BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago the Los Angeles Unified School District agreed to settle a 
lawsuit filed by public interest lawyers on behalf of black and Latino parents. 
The suit contended that the district spends up to $400 less per child on 
schools that serve poor and minority children, primarily because suburban 
campuses attract more experienced, higher paid teachers. The settlement in 
Rodriguez et al. vs. LAUSD requires that spending be roughly equal by 1996.

FIRST PENSION OFFICERS AGREE TO ADMIT CRIMES; FRAUD: IRVINE INVESTMENT FIRM 
FOUNDER, TWO PARTNERS SIGN PLEA DEALS ON DISAPPEARANCE OF CLIENTS' MILLIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The three top officers of a failed Irvine pension management company have 
agreed to plead guilty to anticipated criminal charges resulting from the 
disappearance of more than $100 million in retirement money invested by 8,000 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension Corp. founder William E. Cooper, along with partners Robert E. 
Lindley and Valerie Jensen, have signed cooperation and plea agreements with 
federal prosecutors, said Leslie Swain, assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to proceed with their cooperation and try to get this thing 
unwound," Swain said. "They won't be entering their guilty pleas until we file 
formal charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Swain would not specify when criminal charges may be filed but said the three 
would likely face fraud or related charges in connection with what securities 
regulators have described as an elaborate pyramid scheme involving nonexistent 
mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, the trio may help First Pension clients recoup some of 
their investments by surrendering their stakes in two other Orange County 
business that may have been partially funded with retirement money, according 
to their defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's attorney, Robert C. Bonner, said his client has entered into an 
agreement with federal investigators and will plead guilty to some as yet 
unspecified charges. Jensen's attorney, Don Smaltz, said she has signed a 
similar agreement and has been cooperating with federal authorities by 
providing documents and information since May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very decent person and got sucked into this. She was a watcher . . 
. she was not the director or the leader," Smaltz said. "She didn't want to 
leave (First Pension) because she was afraid pensioners would lose everything." 
</P>
<P>
 And Lindley's attorney, Russell Hayman, said, "My client has not yet pleaded 
guilty, but he has entered into an agreement where at some future point he will 
enter a guilty plea." 
</P>
<P>
 The cooperation agreements were hailed by James Joseph, trustee for the First 
Pension bankruptcy, who held out the prospect that questions of anxious 
investors may now be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's quite a significant development," Joseph said. "I would hope now that 
they will have to cooperate with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that First Pension's owners 
operated an elaborate pyramid scheme, leading clients to invest in mortgages 
that did not exist. As much as $124 million of the money invested by 8,000 
clients may have been lost to fraud and outright theft, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy April 22, just as scores of 
investors who had accounts once valued at $350 million discovered that 
substantial sums were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are now analyzing the best way of maximizing the assets of two 
companies affiliated with First Pension, according to the defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayman said funds were diverted from First Pension's parent company, First 
Diversified Financial Services Inc., to create Amerispec Inc., an Orange-based 
company with assets of $2.5 million and more than 200 franchises that provides 
home inspection services. 
</P>
<P>
 Diverted funds were also used to create National Identification Systems in 
Irvine, which holds a $3.2-million contract to make driver's licenses for the 
state of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, prosecutors "are looking at liquidating the assets, but selling 
the furniture and the computers may not provide much relief for investors. It 
might be better to give investors some kind of stake in the two companies."

 The investments were intended to help First Diversified cover investors' 
losses in mortgage pools, Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While these companies may seem small, they are assets," he said. "The 
question is whether they could be marketed into something larger." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office said it could not comment on the two companies or 
reveal whether additional assets are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas E. Carroll, president of 6-year-old Amerispec, said he was unaware of 
any plan to transfer ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have talked to the U.S. attorney's office and we are a legitimate company 
and are functioning," said Carroll, adding that Cooper, Jensen and Lindley 
stopped being company board members on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
 National Identification Systems, with 25 employees, has been under contract 
with the state of New York to make driver's licenses since 1992 and plans to 
expand, according to President John Larner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely hope to get more states besides New York," said Larner, who 
would not reveal the company's level of assets or whether it is profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 First Diversified continues to have a controlling stake in National 
Identification, though Larner said that Cooper, Jensen and Lindley had not 
contacted him in months.

CONGRESS JOINING RANKS OF D.C. HIGH-CRIME AREAS; ETHICS: SOME OBSERVERS SAY 
LATEST SCANDALS ARE RESULT OF GREATER PUBLIC SCRUTINY. OTHERS BLAME A CORRUPT 
SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
 For years, the neighborhood surrounding Capitol Hill has been a high-crime 
area. Now the crime wave looks to be moving under the Capitol dome itself. 
</P>
<P>
 With the indictment Tuesday of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), the powerful 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the number of criminal 
proceedings involving members of Congress has grown to imposing lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Two former lawmakers are currently in federal prison for financial misdeeds, 
another is free pending appeal of a bribery conviction last fall and still 
another is awaiting sentencing on charges of misusing public funds. Three other 
former legislators recently served time for bribery and related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Rostenkowski, two other senior legislators also are under 
indictment and at least two more appear to be the targets of FBI 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 In this century, only in the late 1970s -- when Congress was rocked by the 
so-called Koreagate and Abscam bribery scandals -- have so many members 
simultaneously been in prison, just out of prison or facing the prospect of 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that accounting does not include the ethical lapses that did not lead to 
criminal prosecutions: the House post office and banking scandals, which 
implicated dozens of members; the sexual-misconduct allegations against Sen. 
Bob Packwood (R-Ore.); the exertions to protect savings and loan owner Charles 
H. Keating Jr. by five senators; or the questionable financial transactions 
that forced the resignations of Democratic leaders Jim Wright and Tony Coelho 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attribute this confluence of scandal not to declining ethics but to 
intensifying scrutiny from the press, public and prosecutors, which has made 
behavior criminal that once was tolerated, if not endorsed. But others insist 
that the climate on Capitol Hill is encouraging legislators to confuse 
incumbency with immunity and power with license. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a clear environment up there that the rules aren't to be enforced," 
said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a group that monitors 
government ethics. "It does enormous damage to the institution because it 
allows lowest-common-denominator ethics to set the public standard for the 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
 The flow of charges has been steady enough to guarantee a good living for 
lawyers who specialize in defending public officials charged in corruption 
cases. "For me, it's been constant," said attorney Stan Brand, who has 
represented more than two dozen legislators since leaving his post as counsel 
to the House of Representatives to open his own firm 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, congressional scandals have covered the gamut of human 
misbehavior. Legislators have fallen into the bottle or the arms of 
prostitutes. A handful have been hauled into court on matters of high 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1919, for example, socialist Victor L. Berger of Milwaukee was convicted of 
violating the Espionage Act for opposing World War I and was denied his seat in 
Congress. But the Supreme Court later overturned his conviction and Berger 
served three more terms in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost all legislators who have gone astray, though, the path from 
lawmaker to law-breaker has involved no principle prouder than greed. Almost 
all the prosecutions of sitting legislators in recent years have involved 
bribery, tax evasion or misuse of public funds. The list includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * New York Democratic Rep. Mario Biaggi, who served 26 months in a 
medium-security federal prison for an extortion conviction in a case involving 
Wedtech Corp., a South Bronx company that spent lavishly in its search of 
defense contracts. Fellow New York Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia was twice 
convicted of extortion in the case and at one point served three months in 
prison, but each conviction was later overturned by a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Rep. Lawrence J. Smith, a Florida Democrat who served three months 
last year for tax evasion and lying to the Federal Election Commission about 
using campaign funds to pay off a gambling debt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pat Swindall, a former Republican representative from Georgia, is scheduled 
to remain until February, 1995, in the minimum-security U.S. penitentiary camp 
in Atlanta after a perjury conviction in a case involving a personal loan. 
Undercover agents told him that the loan involved the proceeds of laundered 
drug money. Swindall has filed a brief with the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of 
Appeals claiming new evidence and seeking to reopen his case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Democratic Rep. Nicholas Mavroules of Massachusetts is to be confined 
until September at a medium-security federal institution in McKean, Pa., after 
pleading guilty last year to an array of bribery and tax-evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Albert G. Bustamante, a former Democratic representative from Texas, was 
sentenced last fall to 42 months in prison for accepting a bribe but is free on 
bond while appealing his conviction to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carroll Hubbard Jr., a former Kentucky Democratic congressman, pleaded 
guilty in April to falsifying campaign reports, using public employees to work 
on his wife's campaign for Congress and obstructing justice. While awaiting 
sentencing on June 30, Hubbard has solicited his former colleagues to send 
letters to the judge urging leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 * In addition to Rostenkowski, two other legislators are currently under 
indictment: Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) on charges of fraudulently billing 
the Senate for use of a condominium he secretly owned, and Rep. Joseph M. 
McDade (R-Pa.), who was indicted in May, 1992, on charges of accepting bribes 
and illegal gratuities from defense lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Published reports also have indicated that the FBI is investigating at least 
two other legislators: Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar), on charges of illegally 
funneling money into his 1992 campaign from a business he owned, and Walter R. 
Tucker III (D-Compton), as part of an investigation of corruption in Compton, 
where Tucker formerly served as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this constitute a congressional crime wave? Compared to other 
professions, the frequency of ethical transgression in the contemporary 
Congress appears relatively high but not entirely out of line. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last 20 years, about three dozen members of Congress either have 
been convicted of criminal offenses or censured by the House and Senate. That 
averages out to about 3.5 legislators in any two-year congressional session -- 
or put another way, about one serious ethical sanction per 150 sitting 
legislators at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare that to lawyers. In the 1989-1990 period, the latest for which 
complete figures are available, about 4,500 practicing lawyers were publicly 
sanctioned by the American Bar Assn. That averages out to roughly one serious 
ethical problem per 190 accredited lawyers during the two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Among securities dealers, serious ethical violations have been more rare: 
During the two-year period of 1992-1993, less than one out of every 500 
licensed securities dealers at the time was disbarred. 
</P>
<P>
 But compared to historical standards, today's Congress might not look so bad. 
Throughout the 19th Century, and even well into this century, Rostenkowski 
might have had considerable company in the activities for which he was indicted 
-- allegedly padding his payroll and diverting official accounts to his 
personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 In those years, the intimacy between money and power, like a particularly 
impetuous infidelity, was often consummated in plain sight. When Daniel Webster 
defended the Bank of the United States against President Andrew Jackson's 
crusade to revoke its charter early in the 19th Century, for instance, the 
famed Massachusetts senator had more incentive than ideology: He was on the 
bank's payroll as an attorney for its president. 
</P>
<P>
 It is against the backdrop of such history -- and the 20th Century equivalents 
involving the now defunct urban political machines -- that attorney Brand 
labels the current surge of congressional prosecutions "part of the 
over-criminalization of life in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Brand attributes the rising number of cases not to deteriorating ethical 
standards but a "higher level of scrutiny, more rules, less tolerance for old 
ways -- not illegal ways but mores -- and more aggressive prosecutorial theory, 
taking peccadilloes and violations of House rules or Senate rules and making 
them into criminal cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are devoting more energy than ever before to rooting out public 
misconduct. Since 1976, the Justice Department has operated a public-integrity 
section that investigates members of Congress and other public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 To most reformers, the real measure of Congress' ethical problems is found not 
in such egregious examples of misconduct, but in the corrosive workaday trading 
of money and favors permitted under current campaign-finance and gift laws. For 
these critics, the workings of Congress testify to journalist Michael Kinsley's 
maxim that in Washington the real scandal almost always involves behavior that 
is legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer turns Brand's argument on its head: One key reason prosecutors have 
become more aggressive in dealing with public officials, he maintains, is that 
Congress has been so lax about enforcing its own ethics rules. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than individual criminal prosecutions, Wertheimer argues, are 
system changes -- such as the reforms in the laws governing gifts and campaign 
contributions now facing an uncertain future in House-Senate conference 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "While these individual cases of criminal prosecution are a serious warning 
signal," Wertheimer said, "the entire system up there is designed to allow 
improper conduct to occur under the guise of proper conduct."

U.S. TO SEEK SANCTIONS IF N. KOREA STALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has decided to seek some form of international 
economic sanctions against North Korea if Pyongyang continues to flout 
international nuclear weapons inspectors, and the United States will soon begin 
sounding out its allies about possible action, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort would be launched only if the U.N.-affiliated International Atomic 
Energy Agency, which is conducting the inspections, formally declares that 
Pyongyang's rebuffs have destroyed inspectors' ability to determine if North 
Korea has diverted fuel to make nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vienna-based agency is expected to issue its report late this week or 
early next, but U.S. officials said they are assuming it will declare North 
Korea out of compliance unless Pyongyang reverses itself soon. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea issued another statement Wednesday saying it will not allow 
inspectors the access they want. But U.S. officials said privately that they 
believe that Pyongyang is still considering the international agency's demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball is in their court," one strategist here said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus on the U.S. approach was achieved by top Administration national 
security policy-makers before President Clinton left for Europe, where he is 
scheduled to take part in a commemoration by the Allies of the 50th anniversary 
of D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton left Washington on Wednesday morning, Administration 
officials continued to discuss the issue late into the afternoon. The President 
is expected to receive periodic briefings. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said initial U.S. soundings of allies are likely to begin Friday, 
when Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci is scheduled to meet here 
with envoys from South Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the central questions are how the sanctions should be 
structured and how tough they can be and still win approval of the U.N. 
Security Council. Washington may have to settle for a gradual imposition of 
sanctions, particularly as China has opposed punishing North Korea formally. 
U.S. officials said they are still unsure how Beijing would vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department, while rejecting Pyongyang's statement as unacceptable, 
continued to hold out hope publicly that North Korea would agree to comply with 
the atomic energy agency's demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no IAEA conclusion yet that North Korea has crossed the line of no 
return," Christine Shelly, the State Department's deputy spokesman, told 
reporters Wednesday. She said North Korea still has a chance to change its 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Vice President Al Gore told reporters that the 
Administration "will not flinch" in its showdown with the North. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not rattling sabers -- we're just saying the same thing that American 
administrations have been saying since the 1950s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said they are still puzzled over North Korea's 
intentions -- whether it is trying to cover up a nuclear weapons program or 
merely playing a cat-and-mouse game in hopes of prodding the West into offering 
more economic incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. intelligence officials said North Korea may well have developed one or 
two nuclear bombs by reprocessing spent fuel rods after it shut down its 
reactor at Yongbyon briefly in 1989. But they are uncertain any weapons have 
been manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea had agreed to allow international inspectors to monitor the 
Yongbyon reactor earlier this year but later barred them from entry. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hannay, Britain's U.N. ambassador, told reporters that although "there 
is no smoking gun" at Yongbyon, "there is circumstantial evidence that points 
in one direction -- and that is not a direction that makes the Security Council 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the council is asked to vote on sanctions, he said, "depends on the 
North Koreans. They have a choice."

ROSTENKOWSKI'S FINAL DRIVE STILL LEAVES HEALTH BILL SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the House Ways and Means Committee gets back to work on health care 
legislation next week, it will have a new chairman -- but the same set of 
problems to face. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that he likely would be forced to relinquish leadership of the panel 
because of looming criminal charges, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) had worked 
feverishly in recent weeks to make as much progress as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 As his starting point, Rostenkowski had used a bill that was barely approved 
by the Ways and Means health subcommittee, which is chaired by Rep. Pete Stark 
(D-Hayward). Modifying the measure in closed-door negotiations with individual 
Democrats, Rostenkowski managed to get within one vote of the 20 that he needs 
to win approval on the 38-member committee. Five Democratic members remain 
uncommitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's effort ended Tuesday, when a federal grand jury indicted him on 
17 felony counts of fraud, embezzlement, conspiracy and obstruction of justice 
in what prosecutors claimed was more than 20 years of corruption. Under rules 
of the Democratic Caucus, Rostenkowski had to step down as committee chairman 
until the charges are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), has already alerted the 
committee that he plans to offer his own first draft of a health bill, but 
aides believe that it will be similar to the one shaped by Rostenkowski. 
Previously, Gibbons had supported the single-payer system, in which the 
government finances health care. However, because it would involve a massive 
tax increase, that system appears to have no chance of passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ways and Means approach is significantly different from those under 
consideration in the other committees. It includes the single most 
controversial feature of Clinton's plan: a requirement that employers pay the 
bulk of their workers' health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, unlike Clinton's proposal, it covers the remaining uninsured with a 
new form of Medicare. That is a step toward a single-payer system, which 
presumably would make it more attractive to Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his departure as chairman, Rostenkowski also had suggested that a 
broad-based tax could be necessary to make up for a $50-billion shortfall in 
the bill -- a proposal that caused shudders at the White House. That issue is 
likely to wait until after the Congressional Budget Office produces its cost 
estimates of the Ways and Means subcommittee bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar deliberations are going on in four other committees in Congress -- two 
in the House and two in the Senate -- and House leaders hope that a 
breakthrough on Ways and Means could help clear the logjam on some of the other 
panels. None of the five committees managed to make their self-imposed Memorial 
Day deadlines for producing their bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many committees share jurisdiction over the issue and because it 
involves so many powerful interests, House and Senate leaders cannot rely on 
the normal legislative process to produce a single bill that can become law. 
Thus, it has always been clear that the actual legislation would be written 
after the committees had done their preliminary work. 
</P>
<P>
 However, because no committee has produced a bill, any sense of momentum has 
been drained out of the process, and that has made members of both the House 
and Senate even more skittish about voting for such a controversial measure in 
an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Rostenkowski appears certain to put more pressure on Energy and 
Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), who also has been unable 
thus far to find the votes to pass a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that the Energy and Commerce Committee is considering a "two-bill 
solution" that could involve approving a version of the President's plan and 
one that would lean more toward a competing proposal offered by committee 
member Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). The full House then could choose between the 
plans. Cooper's bill is less regulatory but does not reach what Clinton has 
said is his bottom-line requirement: guaranteeing that every American will have 
health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The final House committee considering the bill, the Education and Labor 
Committee, is not considered a true testing ground for health legislation, 
because it is among the most liberal in the House. But even there, reaching an 
agreement is proving more difficult than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The disarray in the House appears certain to accelerate health care 
legislation in the direction that it was already headed -- toward resolution in 
the Senate. There, Democrats still have some hope of bringing moderate 
Republicans on board, particularly if they can soften the employer mandate so 
that the burden on the smallest businesses might be lightened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee already has begun drafting a 
bill, with Republicans joining Democrats on many of the votes thus far. 
However, it has not yet dealt with the core issues that divide the two parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Those appear most likely to be worked out in the Finance Committee, where 
Republicans are stronger in number. The Democratic and Republican staffs of the 
committee are working together over Congress' weeklong Memorial Day recess in 
hopes of producing a set of options when the committee members return. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Norma H. Johnson scheduled a June 10 arraignment of 
Rostenkowski at the federal courthouse here. The arraignment initially was set 
for Monday but was moved at the request of Rostenkowski's lawyers, according to 
a spokesman for U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr. Rostenkowski has proclaimed his 
innocence.

L.A. COUNCIL GETS FUNDING TO REVITALIZE HANSEN DAM PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council took the first step Wednesday toward revitalizing 
Hansen Dam Park -- once one of the San Fernando Valley's most popular swimming 
and picnicking areas -- by accepting $5 million in county funds to build 
boating and swimming lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, which was generated by an initiative approved by voters in 1992, 
will be combined with federal matching funds to build a nine-acre boating lake 
and an adjacent 1.5-acre swimming lake designed to be the park's central 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "These lakes are essential features," said Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose 
district includes the 1,400-acre regional park. "This is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen Dam will receive the biggest chunk of Proposition A funding accepted by 
the council for 10 recreation projects citywide, including a $1-million public 
swimming pool at the Sun Valley Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The boating and swimming lakes at Hansen Dam, which are scheduled to open in 
two years, have been high on the wish list of nearby homeowners since the 
130-acre Holiday Lake at the park was closed and drained in 1982. That lake 
became clogged and polluted by debris and silt that had washed down from nearby 
canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 25 years, the lake was a thriving recreation center, drawing 
developers to build homes on hills near the lake and inspiring the name of the 
nearby community, Lake View Terrace. On weekends, the parking lots were crammed 
with swimmers, boaters and picnickers. 
</P>
<P>
 But ever since the lake closed, residents have complained that the park has 
become run-down and a haven for gang members and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest news about the dam encouraged some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," said Lew Snow, former president of the Lake View Terrace 
Homeowners Assn. who has lobbied for the project for years. "The restoration of 
Hansen Dam is a long time coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Snider, current president of the group, was slightly less enthusiastic. 
"It will never be like it once was," she said. "What we need now is a site 
where people can enjoy themselves in a safe setting." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 master plan for the park called for the construction of a 70-acre lake 
to replace Holiday Lake. But those plans are on hold indefinitely, mainly 
because the financially strapped city cannot afford to maintain a lake of that 
size, Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the lakes will begin in October, and swimmers and boaters can 
expect to use them by mid-1996, according to the Army Corps of Engineers, which 
owns the recreation area and is overseeing the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-acre boating and fishing area will be separated from the 1.5-acre 
swimming lake by a raised service road, said Ed Louie, project engineer for the 
Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The lakes will be built on vacant land at a slightly higher elevation than 
Holiday Lake so that they do not collect debris and silt from mountain runoff, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A water filtration system will ensure that the lakes' water always will be 
safe for swimming, Louie said. "It's going to be swimming pool standards," he 
said. "So, it will be very, very clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday Lake was originally formed when "burrow pits," holes that were 
excavated to provide gravel to build the dam, filled up with water. Eventually, 
the lake grew to about 130 acres and was opened in 1949 to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's parks department built a sandy beach and a boat ramp, designated a 
shallow section for swimming and stocked the lake with trout. A grassy picnic 
area with barbecues was created nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), who pressed the federal government for 
its share of the funding, said he hopes the improvements will restore the park 
to its former glory. "It's an eyesore. It's a breeding ground for drug 
dealers," he said. "All this in an area that was a wonderful recreation area 30 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The city Recreation and Parks Commission has considered concession ideas at 
Hansen Dam Park, such as a water slide, but has yet to move on any particular 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission on Wednesday received three consultant proposals to study 
the feasibility of opening a sports facility on 56 acres in the Sepulveda 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants said they can complete a feasibility study on operating 
batting cages, baseball diamonds, soccer fields and other money-making sports 
amenities in six to 17 weeks. The studies would cost between $14,000 and 
$37,120. The commission instructed parks officials to study the proposals and 
make a recommendation.

O.C. AIR SERVICE BY 2ND LOW-COST CARRIER NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a week after John Wayne Airport got its first low-fare airline, the 
Orange County Airport Commission on Wednesday moved to allow a second discount 
carrier to begin service to San Jose, possibly by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air would be allowed to take over flights that American Airlines wants to 
drop because it is losing money competing with the other low-cost carrier, 
Southwest Airlines, on the route. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest, which started service last week to San Jose and Oakland, cut the 
fare that American and other carriers were charging nearly in half to a flat 
$69 one way. While Reno Air has not indicated what it would charge, its 
everyday fare from Los Angeles International Airport to San Jose is $72 one 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air sought approval in February to start service at John Wayne but was 
rebuffed because there were not enough landing slots available. This time, 
however, Reno Air plans to operate through its strategic relationship with 
American Airlines, using some of its slots. The arrangement could benefit both 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's extremely cost effective and logical and prudent to do what they 
are doing here," said Commissioner Robert L. Cashman before the 3-0 vote. "The 
approach they are taking is the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines has matched Southwest's fare to San Jose, but an American 
spokesman said the route is unprofitable given its competitor's lower costs. 
Linking with Reno Air would be an alternative to ending its service. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is independently owned and run, Nevada-based Reno Air has a 
relationship with American that goes beyond trying to pick up unneeded landing 
slots at John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air offers its passengers credit on American Airlines frequent flyer 
program. And by flying some or all of the six daily flights to San Jose that 
American would be giving up, Reno Air could feed passengers from its 
twin-engine MD-80 jetliners onto American's profitable connecting flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed arrangement, however, is causing some concern among county 
airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Reno Air, by virtue of its link with American, is being allowed 
to hopscotch ahead of at least one other airline -- Mark Air -- on the waiting 
list to start Orange County service. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Airport Director Jan Mittermeier said she is recommending the 
entry of 2-year-old Reno Air only on a conditional basis through September 
while the issue is studied further. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an exception to the rule, a onetime shot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added, however, that she has so far heard of no objections from executives 
of other carriers, including Mark Air, who are being solicited for their views. 
The Reno Air deal is also subject to a review of the contracts by the Airport 
Commission and by a vote of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 While allowing one airline to pass its unused slots to another might not have 
been considered possible in the past, it is now being viewed as a solution to 
changes sweeping the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental change is what analysts see as the emergence of two kinds of 
service. Flights of less than two hours increasingly are characterized by 
basic, inexpensive service -- rather like a flying interstate bus. Longer 
flights continue to offer in-flight movies, meals and other niceties that 
passengers have come to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 On the short flights, the pioneer has been Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, it keeps its planes in the air making money rather than 
sitting on the ground. It reduces costs by eliminating meals, baggage transfers 
and travel agents' computerized reservations systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing its savings on to the customer, the Dallas-based carrier has seen its 
profits soar as the rest of the airline industry has sputtered in the past few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some of the titans are thinking of creating or spinning off sister 
carriers that can compete with the likes of Southwest. Continental Airlines has 
created low-cost, no-frills CALite, which plies routes in the East; United 
Airlines is pondering whether to start a new service dubbed U2, which would 
operate the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new carriers work their way to Orange County, airport officials will 
need to decide how to treat these new upstarts. Are the new airlines required 
to wait in line for landing slots like all the others? Or are they simply 
extensions of their sister carriers, entitled to fly any of their unused slots? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a problem of "two bites of the same apple," as Mittermeier puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's an issue the airport needs to consider to stay abreast of the 
latest events in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rule good five years ago may not be as good today," Mittermeier said.

LOCKED OUT OF CAR, SUSPECT GOT POLICE HELP BEFORE MUHAMMAD SHOOTING; CRIME: 
CAMPUS OFFICER OPENED VEHICLE FOR JAMES BESS, WHO WAS DESCRIBED AS POLITE. AN 
HOUR LATER, BESS ALLEGEDLY WOUNDED THE BLACK NATIONALIST AND FIVE OTHERS.

<P>
 An apparently distracted James Edward Bess locked his keys in his car at UC 
Riverside about an hour before he allegedly shot Nation of Islam speaker 
Khallid Abdul Muhammad -- and campus police came to his rescue, university 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After police confirmed that Bess had rightful use of the vehicle and opened it 
for him, Bess moved the vehicle from a housing complex across the street from 
the gymnasium where Muhammad had begun speaking 45 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess, 49, who was expelled from the Nation of Islam after serving as a 
minister of a Seattle mosque four years ago, never made it back to his car. He 
was beaten by the crowd after he allegedly opened fire with a semiautomatic 
handgun, striking Muhammad and five of his bodyguards after they left the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, police found Bess' vehicle about two blocks away, near one of the main 
campus entrances. Inside the vehicle, they found a high-powered rifle and 
ammunition. At the scene of the shooting, they also recovered a backpack 
containing two semiautomatic handguns that they said belonged to Bess. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing about Bess' behavior or actions attracted the officer's attention when 
he helped Bess get into his car, university spokesman Jack Chappell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing unusual about the vehicle, and the individual's demeanor 
was polite," Chappell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell said the call for police assistance came in at 4:45 p.m. Sunday, 
after Bess was unable to break into his car with a coat hanger he got from a 
student resident on campus. Unknown to Bess, the student called police for 
help, and they promptly showed up, Chappell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus police dispatcher, using the vehicle's license plate number, called 
the registered owner of the car in Washington state, who confirmed that Bess 
had permission to drive it, Chappell said. He would not release the name of the 
owner of the car but said investigators were following up with that person. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad and his bodyguards were shot just minutes after 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bess -- who was convicted of manslaughter in 1964 in Missouri and who shot and 
killed his brother in Fresno in 1975 in what was ruled self-defense -- has been 
charged in the Muhammad shooting with one count of attempted premeditated 
murder and five counts of assault with a firearm. He has pleaded not guilty and 
is being held without bail and remains hospitalized at Riverside General 
Hospital from injuries -- including a broken shoulder -- inflicted by people 
who beat him after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad, meanwhile, is in good condition at Riverside Community Hospital, 
where he underwent surgery Tuesday night for the removal of bullet fragments 
from his leg, officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nicandro Marciano, who assisted in the surgery, described Muhammad as 
"uncannily lucky" because the fragments were less than 1 millimeter away from a 
major artery which, if hit, "could have been not only limb-threatening, but 
life-threatening." 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad -- who was suspended last year as spokesman for Nation of Islam 
leader Louis Farrakhan after his verbal assault on Jews, Arabs and whites -- 
has lost feeling in the sole of his foot because of slight nerve damage caused 
by the wound, Marciano said. It was too early to tell if the damage is 
permanent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital spokeswoman Ann Matich said Muhammad is expected to remain 
hospitalized for a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan is scheduled to speak Saturday at the Thomas and Mack Center at the 
University of Nevada in Las Vegas. Officials at the center said they doubt that 
Muhammad will also appear there. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether Muhammad's injury will elevate his stature as an 
outspoken and, in some corners, increasingly popular representative of the 
Nation of Islam is a matter of debate among students of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the shooting, there was discussion among academics about the 
potential rivalry between Farrakhan and his former spokesman, Muhammad, said 
Aminah Beverly McCloud, assistant professor of Islamic studies at DePaul 
University in Chicago, where the Nation of Islam is headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan had criticized Muhammad for the sharp language of his anti-Semitic 
comments -- but not its content. Although the two appear to remain close, it is 
unclear what direction their relationship is taking, McCloud said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan was seen as more the gentleman of the two and open to potential 
dialogue with Jews and others, while Muhammad was seen as more hard-line, 
McCloud said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad is especially popular among young people but his following is growing 
across class and educational lines, McCloud said. Whether Muhammad tries to 
capitalize on the shooting remains to be seen, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Mamiya, associate professor of religion and Africana studies at 
Vassar College, said he was unaware of any rivalry between Farrakhan and 
Muhammad -- yet. And although Muhammad does not have the organizational base to 
challenge Farrakhan at this point, "I'm sure he'll be in greater demand" 
because of the shooting, Mamiya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the current relationship between Farrakhan and Muhammad, officials 
with the Nation of Islam seem to be taking a clear interest in the shooting. 
Chappell said that late Tuesday night, about 20 people who identified 
themselves to campus police as "from Chicago" and "associated with the Nation 
of Islam" showed up at the shooting site and re-enacted the event, apparently 
for their own purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell said the group left within an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman downplayed the discovery of a hole in a construction fence that 
borders the 5-month-old gymnasium, along the side where Muhammad parked his 
vehicle on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A hedge of large bushes runs along the inside of the fence -- providing a 
possible hiding place for a sniper who intended to take aim at Muhammad's 
vehicle, some reporters speculated at a news briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell said campus police were unaware of the hole in the fence until 
Tuesday, but said the small hole, through which a person conceivably could have 
crawled to hide in the bushes, appeared to have been there for some time. 
Investigators nonetheless are investigating whether Bess might have cut the 
hole, Chappell said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PARTIES AND POSITIONS CAN BLUR IN SLATE MAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The official-looking voters' guide from the California Democratic Alliance may 
seem as if it came straight to your mailbox from the state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 But if so, what is Wilbert Smith, a conservative Republican running for state 
superintendent of public instruction, doing on it? Or Stuart Hirsh, a candidate 
for judge who faces suspension by the State Bar for multiple acts of misconduct 
and describes his politics as "just to the right of Genghis Khan"? 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the world of slate mailers, where, like Alice's Wonderland, things 
are not always what they seem. 
</P>
<P>
 While critics contend that slate cards are inherently deceptive -- they look 
like official endorsements but actually are paid political ads -- millions are 
being mailed statewide in the final days before Tuesday's California primary 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, with no incumbents running in six of the nine statewide races, 
the tricky missives are playing a particularly significant role, especially in 
the "down-ticket" races below those for governor and U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in these contests, as well as in hundreds of local races, rely 
heavily on slate mailers, which provide a relatively cheap way -- and for some 
the only way -- to get their names before voters. Their names typically appear 
next to those of candidates in the big races for governor and U.S. Senate in a 
format festooned in red, white and blue and bearing icons of donkeys or 
elephants, depending on the "endorsing" party. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every major candidate for statewide office below that of governor 
has bought space on one or more slate cards. Struggling for name recognition, 
treasurer candidate Phil Angelides and insurance commissioner candidate Burt 
Margolin have each plunked down more than $300,000 to appear in the "Voters 
Guide" -- one of the granddaddies of slate cards, which will reach about 2 
million Democratic households. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are the lesser-known mailers, such as the California Democratic 
Alliance, produced by political consultant Fred Huebscher, who covers all the 
political bases by selling space on slate cards titled "Citizens for Republican 
Values" and the "Independent Voters League." 
</P>
<P>
 Often employing sophisticated technology, the slate card operators target 
their mailings to carefully defined groups of voters. There are law-and-order 
cards aimed at senior citizens, and pro-abortion rights cards aimed at 
Democratic women. Most slate mailer entrepreneurs boast of the ability to 
identify and reach "high propensity" voters -- those who year after year show 
up at the polls for primaries and special elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the people behind the commercial slate cards are callous profit 
seekers, with no qualms about deceiving voters while selling space to the 
highest bidder. Often, well-known candidates appear at the top of the card 
without their knowledge and without paying a dime, just to add luster to the 
slate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been concerned for a long time by the deception practiced by the slate 
mailers," said Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto). Although disclosure 
requirements have gradually been tightened over the years -- requiring the 
mailers to say that they are not prepared by official party organizations and 
to identify which candidates paid for the mailing with an asterisk -- Sher 
believes that the current rules are inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, a "Democratic" slate card urged votes for Democratic 
candidates Dianne Feinstein and Kathleen Brown, along with Dan Lungren and Matt 
Fong. The mailer neglected to mention that Lungren and Fong, who helped pay for 
the mailing, are Republicans. Feinstein and Brown, both Democrats, did not pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The same people who collected $219,000 this year for slots on "Your Pro-Choice 
Voter Guide" also collected $241,000 for "Your Law and Order Voter Guide." 
</P>
<P>
 Some political consultants complain of implicit blackmail in the selling of 
the cards -- the threat that if one candidate or ballot measure committee is 
unwilling to pay the asked-for price, an opponent could be included instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The people behind the slate mailers defend their business, saying it differs 
little from selling newspaper or television ads. Yet the slate cards are 
different because they imply a thoughtful review of candidates and 
propositions, even though the decisions are often simply a matter of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pioneers in the business is Democratic political consultant Larry 
Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Levine and his then-partner, Jill Barad, issued a general 
election slate card called "Your Ballot Guide." The version sent to Democrats 
featured a prominent donkey symbol. It gave space at no cost to national 
candidates such as Bill Clinton and Al Gore. The version sent to Republicans, 
featuring an elephant logo, omitted Clinton and Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 But common to both was a prominent endorsement for Deane Dana, a Republican 
running for the nonpartisan post of Los Angeles County supervisor, who paid to 
be there. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Levine's "Voter Guide" includes Kathleen Brown at no cost as part 
of a "Democratic Team to Beat Pete Wilson." State superintendent of public 
instruction candidate Maureen DiMarco paid $42,000 to be on the same card. 
DiMarco is a Democrat, but hardly a member of a team to beat Wilson. Rather, 
she is a member of his Cabinet, as secretary of child development and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us in the business have some ideological thread woven through what 
we're doing," Levine said. "It may get stretched. Sometimes it may be snapped." 
</P>
<P>
 The slate cards, he said, probably have little impact on the well-funded major 
campaigns, such as those for governor and U.S. Senate. Those campaigns rely on 
broadcast advertising and receive abundant coverage in the press, Levine said. 
It's the down-ticket races and the local candidates who depend on slates. "It's 
an effective means . . . at a low unit cost. It's another form of advertising 
for candidates asking, 'How many times can I get my message to how many people 
for a buck?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not all slate operations are commercial enterprises. Labor unions, trade 
groups and other organizations pick slates of their own and distribute them to 
members -- often at no cost to the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the California Democratic Party decided to send out a slate card 
for the primary, creating friction within Democratic ranks because party 
Chairman Bill Press had been telling candidates that there would be no mailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these (commercial) consultant slates are purely for-profit, mercenary 
operations, and the (group) behind them has no standing other than 
salesmanship, an ability to get candidates to pay," Press said. "It's 
outrageous. I'd much rather see one slate put out by the party and no other 
slates." 
</P>
<P>
 On the official Democratic slate are Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles 
for secretary of state, Assemblyman Rusty Areias of San Jose for controller and 
state Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles for insurance commissioner, all candidates 
in partisan races who were formally endorsed at the state party's April 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Press also included Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), who is running 
for the nonpartisan office of state superintendent of public instruction and 
was endorsed at the convention by acclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a 1986 voter-approved initiative bars political parties from 
endorsing candidates in nonpartisan races. Arguing that it was the party's 1st 
Amendment right to inform party members of the convention action, Press 
included Eastin, who is featured prominently at the top of the card. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Republican Party won a state court order temporarily halting 
the distribution of the final 250,000 of 1 million slate cards with the Eastin 
endorsement. But on Wednesday, a federal court judge sided with the Democrats 
-- agreeing that the state initiative was invalid and allowing the party to put 
the remaining cards in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the public got a rare look at the inner workings of the commercial 
side of the slate mailer business, when secretary of state candidate Michael 
Woo sued Democratic political consultant Clint Reilly for breach of contract. 
Woo said he was dumped from the Reilly-operated "California Democratic Voter 
Checklist" after agreeing to pay $90,000 for a place on two mailings to be sent 
to more than 1 million households. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), a close ally of 
Moore, phoned Kathleen Brown to complain about Reilly's decision to sell space 
to Woo. Reilly is Kathleen Brown's campaign chairman. After the call, Reilly 
returned Woo's $60,000 down payment and agreed to put Moore on the card. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court statement, Reilly contended that Woo should have been aware "that I 
reserve the right to change endorsements and make any changes I see fit in the 
brochures or cards up to the moment printing starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Woo failed to persuade a San Francisco Superior Court judge to stop the 
mailing.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON RETURNS FEINSTEIN'S TAX-DODGING 
CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just 24 hours after Sen. Dianne Feinstein accused her leading Republican rival 
of dodging his taxes, GOP candidate Michael Huffington responded in kind 
Wednesday with a new television commercial raising questions about whether 
Feinstein has paid enough federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's ad says he has paid "every penny in tax that he owes," rejecting 
a charge made in a Feinstein television ad released Tuesday that Huffington 
"avoided California taxes" by maintaining a residence in Texas until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican commercial then escalated the exchange by saying that Feinstein 
is a millionaire "and yet in three separate years, (she) paid no federal income 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaign manager Bob Schuman acknowledged he had no evidence that 
Feinstein owed taxes during those three years. He said the information was 
revealed when the Democrat released her income tax statements while she was a 
candidate in the 1990 governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Schuman said, "if Mrs. Feinstein wants to see a tax cheat, perhaps she 
should look in the mirror. All we are saying are the facts. This is the 
campaign that called Mike Huffington a tax cheat." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, a freshman congressman from Santa Barbara, has declined to release 
his own income tax statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials reacted angrily to the new commercial, saying 
that it was particularly "sleazy" because the reason she did not pay taxes in 
1978 and 1979 was because of the death of her husband, Bertram Feinstein, from 
cancer. Officials said the illness forced the couple to pay expensive medical 
bills even as they lost income. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible, terrible, horrible, debilitating part of her life and it 
was a tough, tough economic time for them," said Feinstein campaign adviser 
Bill Carrick. "He's pretty sleazy. . . . Even during the (1990 Pete) Wilson and 
Feinstein war, nobody stooped this low." 
</P>
<P>
 The third year that Feinstein did not pay federal income taxes, 1985, was due 
to a financial loss absorbed by her and her husband, Richard Blum, that 
exceeded that year's income, her campaign said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many campaign observers, the heated exchange was the explosion of a 
political volcano that has been rumbling for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Huffington's commercials during the spring have targeted Feinstein's 
record on taxes and crime. With the latest exchange, the two millionaire 
candidates are accusing each other of dodging taxes even though neither has 
proof of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this proves is that the Senate race is going to be a slugfest," said 
Darry Sragow, who managed Feinstein's 1990 governor's race and now works with 
gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi. "Six months ago, people were suggesting 
that Feinstein would be able to slide into a new term in the Senate. Now, 
indeed, Dianne is going to have to fight to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington led his nearest GOP rival in next Tuesday's primary, William E. 
Dannemeyer, by 14 points in a Times poll last week. Dannemeyer also increased 
the volume of his campaign this week, mimicking Feinstein's charge that 
Huffington is a Texas carpetbagger who avoided California taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's charge stems from the fact that Huffington and his wife claimed 
separate residences from 1988 to 1991. Huffington said he lived in Houston 
while he worked at the family's oil and gas company until its sale was 
finalized in 1991. He said he spent weekends in Santa Barbara, where his wife 
lived and where his two daughters were born. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign contends that Huffington remained in Texas because that 
state has no income tax. California state tax officials said, however, that 
residency laws are hard to prove and that Huffington's situation does not 
appear suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign also acknowledged that it had no proof of wrongdoing, 
calling instead for the state Franchise Tax Board to investigate questions 
about the Republican's proper residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein officials said the senator was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also was unavailable, but his ad, which began airing Wednesday 
night, said the Democrat's commercial was the act of a "desperate politician." 
And his new commercial begins by attributing Feinstein's attack to polls that 
show her support dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's lead over Huffington in a hypothetical matchup in the Los Angeles 
Times Poll last week was 14 points, about half of what it was in a statewide 
Times survey in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has given his campaign at least $6.3 million from his personal 
fortune to help propel his standing from a little-known congressman to major 
Senate rival in just a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign observers from both parties say Feinstein's attack is evidence that 
Huffington was beginning to threaten the incumbent senator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's got to worry about this race getting too close," said Sal 
Russo, a Republican political consultant in Sacramento. "If Feinstein doesn't 
respond, she's crazy. . . . In contemporary politics, charges unanswered are 
charges believed." 
</P>
<P>
 Russo added that senators traditionally have difficult reelections in 
California because the state is so big. He said Feinstein "has done about as 
well as you can do in getting attention. And yet look what's happened to her."

HILL QUESTIONED ON $2,500 HONORARIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal prosecutor on Wednesday pressed state Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) 
to explain why he was paid $2,500 for an informal hourlong session with an FBI 
undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, on trial for alleged corruption, acknowledged that the 1988 honorarium 
was for the time he spent in the undercover agent's hotel suite bantering about 
hunting, air shows and sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two thousand, five hundred an hour?" Assistant U.S. Atty. John Vincent asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't getting paid by the hour," shot back Hill, who nonetheless called 
the sum generous. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent asked Hill, who was an assemblyman in 1988 when he received the 
payment, if he ever had a job that paid $2,500 an hour, and the legislator said 
no. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange mirrored much of Hill's second and final day on the stand as 
Vincent tangled with the normally unflappable lawmaker, who is charged with 
extortion, conspiracy and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 After his testimony, Hill's lawyers rested their case and the jury began 
hearing the defense of Hill's co-defendant, former Senate Democratic aide Terry 
E. Frost. Frost is charged with being part of a conspiracy with Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the trial's 13th day, Vincent peppered Hill with questions about 
his truthfulness, especially in statements to the FBI and in the way he listed 
honorariums on state-required economic disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after Hill accepted the $2,500 honorarium check, he received a call 
from the undercover agent, who was posing as a Southern businessman pushing 
legislation to help his shrimp business locate near Sacramento. The agent 
sought to increase Hill's payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said he was surprised and did not want the agent, known as George Miller, 
"to think there was a connection" between the money and Hill's help on the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Vincent seemed to shake Hill, who acknowledged that perhaps he 
could have been more explicit. "I wish I had responded in a different way," 
Hill said. "But I think I made it clear" that the payment did not need to be 
increased. There were no additional payments from the undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent also took Hill to task for failing to directly answer questions from 
federal agents when the FBI sting became public at the end of the 1988 
legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Hill never told the agent that he was the co-author of the 
shrimp bill. "I don't believe he asked me," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you didn't tell him," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Hill cited the hectic events at the end of the legislative 
session, when lawmakers vote on hundreds of bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your mind is like mush those last few weeks," said Hill, the first Republican 
lawmaker to stand trial in the decade-long federal probe of corruption in the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to further tarnish Hill, Vincent asked whether he failed to properly 
spell out what he had done to receive thousands of dollars in honorariums in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill acknowledged that during 1986 and 1987 -- before the sting surfaced -- he 
lumped together a broad range of paid activities under the heading "speech" on 
state-required disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a generic term that's wide-ranging," Hill said, adding he had 
been paid honorariums for attending a lunch. He maintained that the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission had never questioned him about the apparent 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 But after he became a target of the corruption probe in 1988, Hill 
acknowledged that his campaign treasurer changed the description to 
"honorarium." 
</P>
<P>
 After Hill's lawyers rested their case, Frost began to mount his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost said he turned down a consulting fee to work on the shrimp bill from 
another Senate Democratic aide, John Shahabian. At the behest of the FBI, 
Shahabian was acting as a secret informant and taping conversations with Frost 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Barry Keene (D-Ukiah), Frost said he 
complained to other Democratic staffers about Shahabian's overture and that 
Shahabian "never ever said another word about consulting dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Frost continued to have a series of conversations with Shahabian 
about how to move the shrimp bill through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost described the measure as completely non-controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill could have sailed through the Legislature," he testified. "My dog 
could have lobbied it through." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial resumes today.

LESBIAN ARMY OFFICER WINS BATTLE IN COURT; MILITARY: FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS 
REINSTATEMENT OF COL. MARGARETHE CAMMERMEYER. RULING RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT 
'DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The highest-ranking military officer ever to challenge the armed forces over 
sexual orientation was ordered reinstated Wednesday in a ruling so broad as to 
cast doubt on the Clinton Administration's "don't ask, don't tell" policy for 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Army Col. Margarethe Cammermeyer, a Vietnam War veteran and Bronze Star 
recipient, won at least the first step in her case to resume her 26-year 
military career. U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly's order held that the 
military could not discriminate against homosexuals just because of society's 
prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mere negative attitudes, or fear, are constitutionally impermissible bases 
for discriminatory governmental policies," Zilly wrote in his 51-page ruling. 
"Prejudice, whether founded on unsubstantiated fears, cultural myths, 
stereotypes or erroneous assumptions, cannot be the basis for a discriminatory 
classification." 
</P>
<P>
 Under longstanding but now revised rules of military service, Cammermeyer had 
been forced out of the military in 1992 after she was asked about her sexual 
orientation and replied that she was a lesbian. The question arose while she 
was being interviewed for a security clearance. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, her distinguished service in the Army and the National Guard won 
her a great many sympathizers, including the governor of Washington and the 
chief nurse of the Army, who described Cammermeyer as a "great American." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in discharging her, the military rated her as qualified to lead the Army 
nurse corps and to represent her profession "anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Zilly's decision followed at least two other federal court rulings on behalf 
of members of the armed forces who were discharged for being homosexuals. All 
resulted from a 1991 decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which 
held that the Pentagon would have to show a "rational basis" to sustain its 
policy against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Zilly said arguments presented by two military officials -- one a general and 
one a former defense secretary -- failed to meet that test. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rationales offered by the government to justify its exclusion of 
homosexual service members are grounded solely in prejudice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both witnesses testified to the effect that the government's objections to 
homosexual service is based solely on the fears and prejudices of heterosexual 
service members." 
</P>
<P>
 Cammermeyer appeared before Zilly in April. "I served for 26 years. To get all 
that thrown in my face at this point about being unfit or undermining morale -- 
haven't I in some way shown that's not the case?" 
</P>
<P>
 Since Cammermeyer's discharge, the military has changed its rules regarding 
sexual orientation. The current policy of the Administration is not to ask 
uniformed personnel about their sexual orientation but to continue to forbid 
homosexual behavior by men and women in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys who represent homosexuals said Zilly's ruling was significant not 
only because of Cammermeyer's high rank and long service, but because it was so 
sweeping as to invite a challenge to any type of military discrimination 
against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a terrific ruling; it's very strong," said Mary Newbombe, who worked 
on Cammermeyer's case as cooperative council for the Lambda Legal Defense and 
Education Fund, a homosexual-rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rationale that Zilly used, the evidence that he considered, would apply 
equally to the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there have been no court rulings on the Administration's military 
policy toward homosexuals, although a federal judge in April issued a temporary 
injunction forbidding the discharge of six members of the armed forces who 
filed suit to fight the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cammermeyer, 52, the mother of four, now works at the Department of Veterans 
Affairs hospital at American Lake, near Tacoma, Wash. She described herself 
Wednesday as "absolutely ecstatic. I feel like a kid. . . . The first thing I 
did was holler so everybody at the hospital knew what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like a vindication of all the struggles so many of us have had. I 
can't say that I'm speechless -- I can't afford to be. It's just very 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorneys said they hoped Cammermeyer might instantly be reinstated with 
the state National Guard. But in the two previous 9th Circuit cases -- 
including that of sailor Keith Meinhold, who won a lower-court ruling saying 
the military's exclusion of homosexuals was unconstitutional -- the Pentagon 
has appealed and very well may do so in this case too.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: FOR BROWN, AN ISSUE WITH A HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Decades ago, former Gov. Pat Brown advised his son Jerry: "In California, you 
don't mess with a man's guns." When Jerry became governor, he amended that 
counsel to include "a man's car." Now, daughter Kathleen seems to have quietly 
adopted this paternal guidance for "the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 You don't mess with something that's favored by three-fourths of all voters 
and two-thirds of your own party, even if you find it morally repugnant. You 
try hard not to even talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic front-runner for 
governor, says only that she'll enforce the death penalty and insists that's 
really all voters want or need to know. Her reasons for opposing it -- on 
religious grounds as a Catholic and its questionable value as a deterrent -- 
are "irrelevant," she contends. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not irrelevant, she knows from close-up observation, is the firestorm 
this issue can ignite if it is not handled delicately. She was a young 
teen-ager when her father briefly stayed the execution of "Red Light Bandit" 
Caryl Chessman -- at Jerry's urging -- and then led an unsuccessful fight to 
abolish capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family was booed in public," Pat Brown later wrote in his autobiography. 
"My political stock fell so low that there was talk of a recall." During her 
father's two terms, Kathleen watched him agonize as he sent 36 people to the 
gas chamber and commuted the sentences of 23 others to life imprisonment. The 
issue "seriously damaged my political future," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown later saw her brother irreparably injure his career by 
appointing Rose Elizabeth Bird as chief justice of the California Supreme 
Court. Bird's continual overturning of death penalty sentences prompted her 
ouster by angry voters. 
</P>
<P>
 So, based on her own family's experience, Brown believes this is an issue to 
avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 If she's upfront and says it's her belief that the state doesn't have a moral 
right to kill, then -- she suspects -- some reporter next will ask about the 
morality of government waging war or financing abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 If she asserts that capital punishment is not a deterrent to violent crime or 
maintains -- as her father did -- that it also clogs the courts and is enforced 
unfairly, this will provide ammunition for her political opponents, she 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 And she's probably right. But there is no escaping this issue, especially for 
a Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 By stonewalling when pressed by reporters to be more forthcoming about her 
views, she may be aggravating the damage already caused by being on the "wrong 
side" politically. She is adding to the debate an unnecessary aura of mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 She is licensing political adversaries such as Darry Sragow, campaign manager 
for Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, to proclaim: "Refusing to say why 
she's opposed to the death penalty makes this a character issue. Voters don't 
expect to always agree with elected officials, but they expect them to have the 
courage to deal with an issue straight-on." 
</P>
<P>
 Character and courage are premium political buzzwords. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After last week's televised debates, Sragow conducted a poll and concluded 
that Brown is most vulnerable on the death penalty. So he is staking 
Garamendi's slim chance for victory in the Democratic primary on a TV ad 
attacking Brown's position. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened next puzzled many political pros. Brown's campaign manager, 
Clint Reilly, countered with a TV ad bashing Garamendi for his handling of the 
failed Executive Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had virtually ignored Garamendi until this point, targeting instead 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. She had been playing a "November strategy." And 
the question was: Why now use up $500,000 to attack Garamendi when she's 
comfortably ahead by 12 points among likely voters, according to the latest 
Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The conventional wisdom is that Reilly is taking no chances; an upset loss 
could end Brown's career and certainly play havoc with his. But this ad 
strategy has as much to do with November as with Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly sees Wilson and Garamendi as surrogates. The governor's TV ads 
attacking Brown have benefited Garamendi, who stands to reap the benefit in 
votes. Wilson was a surrogate campaigner for Garamendi, Reilly theorizes, and 
on Tuesday Garamendi will be a surrogate recipient of potential Wilson votes in 
November. Reilly doesn't want Democratic voters to get into the habit of voting 
for any gubernatorial candidate except Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are two other reasons for hitting Garamendi, in Reilly's view: He 
deserves it for beating up on Brown, and it sends a message to Wilson that any 
attacks will be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Wilson is waiting his turn to attack Brown on the death penalty. She may 
find that her best remedy is a dose of candor.

SMOKING INITIATIVE FACES LEGAL TEST; ELECTIONS: ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE SEEKS 
PERMISSION TO FIND WHETHER PEOPLE WERE MISLED INTO SIGNING PETITIONS FOR THE 
BALLOT MEASURE BACKED BY TOBACCO GIANT PHILIP MORRIS. OPPONENTS CALL THE MOVE 
POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING. 
</P>

<P>
 Contending that there is reason to believe that tobacco giant Philip Morris 
"engaged in a systematic scheme of deception" to gain signatures for a 
statewide smoking initiative, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller filed legal 
action Wednesday that could lead to disqualification of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 In what he says is an unprecedented step, Miller asked the Superior Court in 
Sacramento to give him permission to question a sampling of voters who signed 
the initiative petition to determine whether they were deliberately 
misinformed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure would abolish all local smoking bans and replace them with 
a looser, statewide standard. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Philip Morris-financed Californians for Statewide Smoking 
Restrictions argued that Miller's action was unconstitutional and that he was 
grandstanding to give him an advantage over his opponents in Tuesday's 
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is blatantly clear that this is a fairly desperate attempt to call 
attention to himself in his campaign for secretary of state," said Lee H. 
Stitzenberger, whose firm, the Dolphin Group, represents the smoking initiative 
committee, Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Miller's primary opponents, former Los Angeles City Councilman Michael 
Woo, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the appearance that (Miller) continues to use the office to advance 
his campaign goals that could have been avoided by waiting until after the 
election," said Woo's campaign manager, Steven Glazer. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said politics played no part in his decision to go to court this week; 
that he needed to act quickly to get the matter settled by June 30, the 
deadline for certifying measures for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's action was hailed by anti-smoking forces. Carolyn Martin, chairwoman 
of the Coalition for a Healthy California, said "a scientific survey will prove 
that a least half of those who signed the tobacco industry petition were duped 
or signed under false pretenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1972, when signers of an initiative to legalize marijuana said they were 
being harassed by police, state law has protected the confidentiality of names 
on initiatives, referendums and recall petitions. They can be checked for 
accuracy by county election officials, but may be inspected for other purposes 
only with court approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller wants the court to allow him to identify 400 or more randomly selected 
signers, who would be asked to describe what they were told by signature 
gatherers. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents released by Miller show that paid signature gatherers were told not 
to deviate from two pitches made to potential signers -- that the petition 
imposed "statewide smoking restrictions" and that it increased penalties for 
selling tobacco to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The hired workers were apparently not to tell voters the initiative would 
strike down local smoking ordinances that were stronger than the new law or 
that Phillip Morris was the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoking initiative committee's financial statements show that Philip 
Morris provided $491,213 to qualify the measure. A smattering of bars and 
restaurants, including Willy's Lounge in Pomona and the Tonga Hut in North 
Hollywood, provided the rest, a total of $480. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said that if he establishes that there was deception, he would ask the 
court to invalidate the ballot measure under a statute barring circulators from 
misrepresenting the contents of an initiative petition. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative committee has gathered 607,000 signatures to place the measure 
on the November ballot. It takes 423,473 to qualify. Election officials in each 
county, who by law have access to the names, are now determining the validity 
of the signatures.

ISRAELI SOLDIERS OPEN FIRE ON WEST BANK RIOTERS, WOUND 17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the worst outbreaks of violence since Palestinian self-rule began in 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers wounded 17 Palestinian rioters who 
attacked a police station Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence came one day after undercover police officers killed two Islamic 
militants. At Wednesday's funeral of one of the victims, a senior Palestinian 
official said such killings made it difficult to drum up support for continued 
peace talks with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli sources said rioters attacked the Israeli police station in Ramallah, 
a town of 30,000 people that is not in the self-rule zone, early Wednesday 
morning. Soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But doctors at the emergency room in Ramallah Hospital told reporters that 
some of the 17 Palestinians admitted for treatment had been hit with live 
ammunition and rubber-coated steel bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 They said four had chest or neck wounds from regular bullets and one was in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the soldiers seemed to be particularly rough in trying to quell 
the disturbances, aiming for the chests of the 150 youths heaving rocks and 
bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramallah is near Al Ram, where security forces shot and killed two members of 
Hamas, a Muslim extremist group, as they were getting off a bus Tuesday. Hamas 
opposes the autonomy agreement, which took effect May 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The rioters Wednesday were from many political factions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Hamas activists slain Tuesday was wanted in the killing of a Shin 
Bet secret service agent in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians said Israeli agents disguised as vegetable vendors called the two 
men off a bus at a stop, then shot them without warning. The army refused to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings ignited violent protests in Al Ram. Activists took to the 
streets, burning tires. Stones were thrown and troops opened fire, wounding 
four Palestinian protesters, Palestinians said. 
</P>
<P>
 Street battles, which occurred almost daily during the six-year Palestinian 
uprising, virtually stopped after Israeli forces withdrew from Arab-populated 
areas of Gaza and from Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli security forces, however, have continued ferreting out Islamic 
militants who oppose the Israel-PLO accord. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's funeral, a mourning relative who is also a Palestine Liberation 
Organization brigadier said, "We don't have any other chance but to keep peace 
and to commit ourselves to an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 But the killings "make it difficult for me to convince my family to support 
peace," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

IMMIGRATION; CRIMINALS MAY SLIP THROUGH INS LOOPHOLE ON FINGERPRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve blocks from the Immigration and Naturalization Service headquarters, a 
foreigner with an extensive criminal record can deceive the owners of a 
fingerprint shop, get a fake set of prints and then use them at the INS to 
become a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS requires all immigrants who apply for naturalization to submit 
fingerprints so the FBI can run a background check. But agency personnel 
stopped taking fingerprints 10 years ago for budgetary reasons, instructing 
applicants to have them taken by private firms instead. In many cases, the 
applicants do so without providing proof of their identities, according to a 
report issued by the Justice Department inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS has failed to regulate private firms and has no means of preventing 
immigrants intent on hiding their arrest records from enlisting someone with a 
clean history to submit their prints instead, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the problem lays just across town from the headquarters. Adrianne 
Lucke, manager of ASL Business Services, which started offering fingerprinting 
service four years ago, said she was never instructed by the INS to check 
applicants' identification. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one ever instructed me that that's what I have to do," said Lucke, who 
fingerprints about 10 people each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have more established procedures. At Authorized Fingerprinting and 
Passport Photos in Los Angeles, owner Thomas Kitrell says he is leery of 
customers without identification who seek fingerprinting. He said he writes 
down the driver's license number of every person who has prints taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a problem and is something I've always felt is a big hole in the 
system," Kitrell said. "We're letting the world's criminals into our country."

 Last year, the FBI turned up 9,000 arrest records among the 866,000 
applications for U.S. immigration benefits that included fingerprints. But "an 
unlimited number" of immigrants with criminal histories could still slip by 
federal law enforcers if the INS doesn't close loopholes in its application 
procedures, said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who released a study of 
the problem Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have enough problems with criminals born right here in the United States," 
Lieberman said. "We don't need to invite trouble by making it easier for 
criminal aliens to become criminal citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman suggested that the INS begin charging fees to immigrants applying 
for benefits to pay for in-house fingerprinting or start licensing private 
firms to take fingerprints. He said local law enforcement offices also could 
offer the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman threatened to introduce legislation to change INS policy if the 
agency does not act soon on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials acknowledged Wednesday that their procedure is flawed, but 
they resisted the idea of imposing new fees on immigrants who already have to 
pay $90 simply to file a naturalization application. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have to charge more in a system that is already fee-based," said Rick 
Kenney, an INS spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force created to develop better application procedures is due to issue 
its recommendations later this month, but Kenney cautioned that changes in 
agency rules may not take effect until August. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for naturalization, asylum or other status may be denied 
depending on the seriousness of an applicant's crimes. In most cases, felony 
convictions of drug trafficking, prostitution or other vice-related offenses 
would be grounds for rejection, according to INS policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet immigrant crime appears to be mounting in the United States, and the INS 
has become a flash point for criticism. Immigrant felons make up more than 25% 
of the federal prison population and are its fastest-growing segment, according 
to a Senate report released in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many people trying to move the system too quickly," said Dan 
Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. "I 
can just visualize someone taking the oath of citizenship in court while being 
indicted in a room down the hall."

GOVERNMENT; RAPPERS, TV, ADS ARE ENLISTED TO SELL SERVICE PROGRAM; WHITE HOUSE 
HAS LAUNCHED HUGE CAMPAIGN TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THE NEW AMERICORPS 
EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A beaming President Clinton, flanked by young people, is shown striding across 
the White House South Lawn. Everyone is clapping. 
</P>
<P>
 "AmeriCorps -- Coming Soon To Communities Everywhere," says the advertisement, 
which White House officials hope will be as effective at getting participants 
for national service as Smokey Bear has been at reducing forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
 AmeriCorps is the President's signature domestic "peace corps" program. 
Starting in September, it will send young Americans into communities to "get 
things done" -- like immunizing infants, tutoring teen-agers and making schools 
and neighborhoods safe. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, workers -- expected to number 20,000 the first year -- will receive 
a low wage, health benefits and stipends of $4,725 for each year of service 
that they can use for education or training. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though 60,000 people have called to inquire about signing up for the 
program, Eli Segal, the President's national service czar, says he is a little 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we throw a party and no one comes, then we haven't thrown a party," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure that does not happen, the Corporation for National Service, the 
independent agency Segal heads, has begun a sales campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step was coming up with a logo, and that meant the "30-something" 
agency officials had to design a logo cool enough to appeal to those in their 
teens and 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation chose a design featuring a letter "A" swimming in a gold sun, 
encircled with the words: "AmeriCorps National Service" in blue block print. 
</P>
<P>
 After emblazoning the logo on T-shirts, badges, patches and bumper stickers, 
it was time to take the campaign on the road to college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 To promote the visits, the corporation enlisted rap artist LL Cool J. In a 
public-service announcement recorded for college radio stations, he urges 
students: "Find out how you can be one of the 20,000 young people committed to 
rebuilding our communities. AmeriCorps, the new national service movement that 
will get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Administration officials, accompanied by rock or rap groups, hit the 
campuses of UCLA, Harvard University, the University of Minnesota and Morehouse 
College in Atlanta last month. Smaller events announcing AmeriCorps took place 
at 50 other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Segal also gave his pitch to national magazines from Elle to Rolling Stone to 
Money, hoping they would help launch national service by running articles in 
their September editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations are under way with Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide to have the 
advertising agency design public-service announcements for radio and TV. 
Popular bands are being asked to talk up the program at concerts through the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Administration is trying to set up partnerships between local TV 
stations and AmeriCorps projects in their area, so they can keep viewers 
informed of what workers are accomplishing. 
</P>
<P>
 This emphasis on accomplishment is important because for the program to expand 
-- or continue to exist after the first few years -- Segal will have to be able 
to show Congress that it is having a real impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Segal said he has some concern that the campaign will create such demand that 
many interested young people will be turned away from the program. On the other 
hand, he said, he does enjoy entertaining the thought that his "product" could 
end up being as popular as the "Cabbage Patch Kids" doll craze. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising campaigns for federal programs serve dual goals. One is to 
stimulate people to do what the government wants. The other is to sell the 
impression to the public that the government is doing what it promised. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, it is perhaps more than coincidence that Clinton figures so 
largely in the public-service ads being distributed to magazines and newspapers 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always start with the assumption that this would not happen if Bill 
Clinton was not the President of the United States," Segal said. "What is 
unique about this is that the President of the United States is so committed to 
it."

U.S. HELP SOUGHT FOR EVACUATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The commander of U.N. troops in Rwanda appealed to the United States on 
Wednesday to send armored personnel carriers and other equipment to help 
evacuate thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official said later in Washington that the commander will get about 50 
vehicles and that arrangements are being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander, Brig. Gen. Romeo Dallaire of Canada, also said that a U.N. team 
had uncovered evidence of killings at a refugee camp on the eve of another 
round of cease-fire talks between rebels and the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallaire said U.N. investigators who inspected the Kabgayi religious compound, 
22 miles southwest of Kigali, reported that "a few" people had been killed and 
many injured. 
</P>
<P>
 They could not confirm local reports that 500 civilians were massacred at the 
camp, or Vatican reports that up to 30,000 have been threatened with death, but 
it was unclear how much freedom they had to investigate. Pope John Paul II has 
asked the United Nations to protect the site. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. workers resumed delivery of food to thousands of stranded civilians in 
the embattled capital, Kigali, on Wednesday, only to cut it off again as mortar 
and artillery rounds slammed into wide swaths of the city.

REPORTERS'S NOTEBOOK; AS RWANDA WAR RAGES, IT REVERBERATES THROUGHOUT REGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six weeks after this empty valley became home to 300,000 Rwandan refugees, 
Benaco is taking on the trappings of permanency. It is now part of Africa's 
life cycle, with births and natural deaths, roadside merchants selling 
everything from batteries to potatoes and practitioners who treat the ill with 
herbs and chants. 
</P>
<P>
 The wealthier people here have radios, and news from the war front in Rwanda 
spreads quickly from tent to tent, where families hunker outside to cook their 
maize rations over campfires of gathered sticks. The survivors of entire 
villages moved across the border as cohesive entities and now dwell here 
clustered together, their social structures intact. 
</P>
<P>
 A young man who calls himself Johnny sat alone by a fire the other night, 
looking across the hills toward Rwanda. He was the oldest of eight children and 
had been a university student. A passerby asked him how he felt being part of 
this great sea of displaced people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sad," he said in English. "Not angry, not afraid, not -- how do you call it? 
-- confused. Just sad." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Annie Faure, a French doctor, has been ministering to the wounded at Gahini 
Hospital in northern Rwanda since May 1. Her patients include 100 war orphans, 
and she is at a loss to explain why the Rwandans at the hospital -- including 
nurses and healing mothers -- ignore the orphans, even refusing to feed them 
unless she is there to check. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need love, particularly after the trauma they have suffered," the doctor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So one afternoon last week she took the orphans, who were well enough to walk, 
to her nearby home. 
</P>
<P>
 She sat them in a big circle in the garden and gave them cookies and told them 
stories with, she said, happy endings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Young con artists in Nairobi, Kenya, have for years used a favorite trick: 
They introduce themselves to Americans on the street and say they will be 
studying at USC or UCLA in the fall. Does the American have time for coffee to 
talk about what university life in the United States will be like? 
</P>
<P>
 Wary Americans know the encounters are always pitches for money. 
</P>
<P>
 One young man who said his name is Peter wasn't making any headway with an 
American visitor the other day, despite an elaborate story about growing up in 
Kenya's highlands with a dozen brothers and sisters and studying nights to earn 
his scholarship at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if I tell you I am a Rwandan refugee?" he said. "Then will you buy me a 
meal?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Along the Uganda side of Lake Victoria, between the villages of Kasensero and 
Lambu, the bodies of thousands of Rwandan massacre victims have washed ashore 
in the last two weeks. Ugandan health officials have expressed concern that the 
rotting corpses may have contaminated the lake and its fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But fisherman Philip Anguma does not share the concern. He was pulling in his 
catch of Nile perch, 100 yards from where rescue teams were plucking half a 
dozen decomposed bodies from the lake. He wrapped his fish in banana leaves and 
sent them off to market in Masaka lashed to the back of his friend's bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Anguma explained: "Of course the lake is safe. I have fished here for years. 
My father fished here too, and he lived to be an old man." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 John Barayagwiza came to bury his infant son in the mist of early morning. 
</P>
<P>
 He stood on a small plateau above the Benaco camp, surrounded by 20 men from 
his village, and they talked loudly about the war. The child's body was wrapped 
in dark plastic provided by the United Nations and lay unattended nearby in the 
brush. Several men labored with hoes and pickaxes to dig a grave in the hard 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon a lay priest came, turning off the dirt road at a sign that said irimbi 
-- cemetery. Then came the body of another child, a week-old girl whose mother 
had died giving birth. And then the covered body of an adult woman, borne by 
four men on a makeshift stretcher. She had died of AIDS, one of the stretcher 
bearers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barayagwiza, a farmer, said it was strange his son should escape the killing 
in Rwanda, only to die here where it was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The service lasted only a few minutes. Then the farmer walked back over the 
hill to gather his remaining seven children and begin the long daily trek in 
search of firewood that would sustain his family.

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton arrived in Italy early today to begin a weeklong 50th 
anniversary commemoration of the start of the World War II liberation of Europe 
by Allied troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, accompanied by his wife, Hillary, and a small army of U.S. officials, 
landed at Rome's Ciampino Airport just after midnight (3 p.m. PDT Wednesday) 
aboard Air Force One after an eight-hour flight from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief welcoming ceremony led by Italian Foreign Minister Antonio 
Martino and flavored with military pageantry, the couple were whisked by 
motorcade to the U.S. ambassador's residence, where they will stay while in the 
Italian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's trip is scheduled to include five major speeches in eight days. He 
will meet with Pope John Paul II today between talks with Italian President 
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and new Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton goes on to Britain on Saturday. His trip will culminate Monday with 
ceremonies at the Normandy beaches where Allied troops launched their D-day 
assault on June 6, 1944.

WASTED 'PEACE DIVIDEND' SPURS U.N. AGENCY TO MAKE SWEEPING PROPOSALS; 
DEVELOPMENT: IT RECOMMENDS INTERNATIONAL TAXES TO AID THE THIRD WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The main U.N. agency for economic development, despairing over the waste of 
almost a trillion dollars of "peace dividend," set down sweeping proposals 
Wednesday -- including an international tax -- for expanding assistance to a 
third of the world in such "abject poverty . . . that words simply fail to 
describe it." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals, to be taken up next year at the United Nations' World Social 
Summit conference in Copenhagen, form the centerpiece of the U.N. Development 
Program's annual report on worldwide human development. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, as always, includes the United Nations' annual rankings of 
countries on a development index based on wealth, education and health. Canada, 
which was second in the world last year, now ranks first, followed by 
Switzerland, Japan (last year's leader), Sweden and Norway. The United States, 
sixth-ranking last year, has fallen to eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency report was less concerned with these rankings than with the 
possibilities of the social summit scheduled for March. 
</P>
<P>
 This conference, a pet project of former Chilean President Patricio Aylwin 
that has won the endorsement of the United Nations, is expected to attract 
scores of heads of state and government, including President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylwin insists the summit is needed because the post-Cold War world -- while 
it has largely adopted democracy for its politics and the free market for its 
economics -- has failed, so far, to come up with a philosophy to deal with its 
social problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is one golden and, I fear, fleeting opportunity to bring the rich and 
the poor together, to make the compacts and to forge the partnerships that are 
needed to achieve sustainable human development in all countries, north and 
south, and that is the social summit," James Gustave Speth, administrator of 
the U.N. agency, told a news conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, largely written by Mahbub ul-Haq, former Pakistani minister of 
finance, the Development Program concludes that global military spending has 
declined $935 billion since 1987. "Unfortunately," the report says, "this peace 
dividend has not been used to finance the world's social agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, the United Nations' main engine for Third World development, 
acknowledges there has been considerable improvement in world development in 
recent years. "While 70% of humanity survived in abysmal human conditions in 
1960 . . . only 32% suffered such conditions in 1992," it states. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency takes little solace in this. "Despite all our technological 
breakthroughs," the report goes on, "we still live in a world where a fifth of 
the developing world's population goes hungry every night, a quarter lacks 
access to even a basic necessity like drinking water, and a third lives in a 
state of abject poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with these problems, the U.N. agency proposes what it calls 
"fundamental changes . . . in the present framework of development 
cooperation." Some of the most sweeping include: 
</P>
<P>
 * "A serious search . . . for new sources of international funding that do not 
rely entirely on the fluctuating political will of the rich nations." The 
report notes some possibilities, such as a global tax on the use of gasoline 
and other non-renewable energy sources and a small tax on transactions of 
speculators dealing in foreign exchange. A tax of $1 on every barrel of oil (or 
its equivalent in coal) would bring in $66 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compensation by rich countries to poor countries for services such as 
pollution control that benefit humankind and for damages caused by market 
barriers such as restrictions on migration of labor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allocation of 20% of the peace dividend in rich countries and 10% in poor 
countries to a new "global human security fund" that would pay for such 
projects as controlling drug trafficking, international terrorism and nuclear 
proliferation. If military spending drops by only 3% worldwide in the next five 
years, there would be a saving -- the peace dividend -- of $460 billion more, 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of an Economic Security Council to deal with issues such as 
unemployment, poverty and food shortages in the same way the U.N. Security 
Council deals with threats to peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Development Program report stresses that wealth and human development 
do not always go hand in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecuador and the Congo, for example, each have a per capita gross national 
product of a little more than $1,000 a year. Yet because of its high life 
expectancy and literacy rates and its low infant mortality, Ecuador ranks 74th 
in the worldwide Human Development Index, while the Congo ranks 123rd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much depends on how the fruits of economic growth are shared -- particularly 
on what the poor get -- and how much the additional resources are used to 
support public services, particularly primary health care and basic education," 
the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Development Program, measuring the health of nations, also discusses 
the concept it calls human security. Under this concept, countries are in 
crisis if they measure poorly on indicators of food supply, jobs, human rights, 
sharing of wealth, ethnic conflict and an overemphasis on military spending. 
Using these, the report names eight countries in crisis: Afghanistan, Angola, 
Haiti, Iraq, Mozambique, Myanmar, Sudan and Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The report expresses disappointment with the continued spending for arms in 
the Third World, despite the Cold War's end. In South Asia and sub-Saharan 
Africa, it says, "armies continued to flourish in the midst of human misery." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing figures over a period from 1988 to 1992, the agency says that the five 
largest exporters of arms to the Third World were the five permanent members of 
the Security Council: Russia, the United States, France, China and Britain. The 
five largest importers of arms in the Third World during this period were: 
India, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Turkey and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The report calls on the World Social Summit to endorse the principle "that no 
nation should spend more on its military than on the education and health of 
its people." 
</P>
<P>
 Although much gloom edged the pages of the report, the U.N. agency had 
positive news as well. A number of countries have managed to increase their 
standing in the Human Development Index markedly in the last three decades. The 
countries that increased their development the most were Malaysia, Botswana, 
South Korea, Thailand, Syria, Turkey, China, Portugal and Iran. Rich and Poor 
</P>
<P>
 The Human Development Index ranks 173 countries based on life expectancy, 
education and income.

U.S. TO HALT ALL FLIGHTS, FINANCIAL TIES WITH HAITI, OFFICIALS SAY; CARIBBEAN: 
MOVES WOULD TIGHTEN EXISTING SANCTIONS. CLINTON REPORTEDLY HAS ORDERED OTHER 
STEPS AIMED AT REGIME'S CIVILIAN BACKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration is planning a ban on all air traffic, including 
passenger service, between Haiti and the United States, as well as a cutoff of 
financial transactions with the Caribbean nation, diplomatic and Haitian 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions, described by a U.S. official as "the next logical step," would 
augment already stringent international economic and financial sanctions that 
have stopped all but commercial passenger air traffic. President Clinton also 
reportedly has ordered other steps aimed at punishing civilian backers of 
Haiti's military rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 The order affecting air and financial services will come this month, perhaps 
within two weeks, one U.S. official said. He said several days' notice will be 
given before the flight cutoff to allow people -- especially Americans -- to 
leave or return to Haiti. Embassy sources estimate there are 1,000 Americans in 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the latest bans target wealthy civilian supporters of 
Haiti's military rulers, who took power in September, 1991, violently 
overthrowing Jean-Bertrand Aristide, this nation's first democratically elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the cuts in air traffic and financial transactions will be the last 
efforts by the White House to persuade the military to give up power or face 
American military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this doesn't show them that we are serious, then I guess only Marines at 
the airport will do it," said an American source in a telephone interview from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The tightening of the sanctions is part of an apparent three-step U.S. 
approach that involves reducing the privileges of the civilian elite; squeezing 
the general population with the aim of causing serious public discontent, and 
openly threatening military action. 
</P>
<P>
 As a measure of the heightened tension here over the possibility of U.S. 
military action, the United Nations and other international organizations later 
this week are expected to order dependents of their officials and employees to 
leave Haiti as soon as possible. One U.N. official said dependents were never 
officially permitted, although several have come to Haiti over the last few 
months anyway. They now are being told to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The French Embassy also is preparing to send dependents out of the country and 
is closing its school early. U.S. diplomats here said a similar American move 
"is always under consideration. But not yet. There is nothing in the works." 
</P>
<P>
 The American move to sever air and financial links would come in an executive 
order from Clinton. It would apply only to flights between the United States 
and Haiti. But it would effectively isolate this tiny island nation, because 
almost all international service in and out of Haiti connects through the 
United States; there are only infrequent flights through Panama, France and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of air service would be little more than an inconvenience, not a 
hardship, for most Haitians, particularly the wealthy families who travel often 
for shopping, entertainment and business. But many among this nation's elite 
take great pride in their access to American culture and commerce and see their 
ability to fly on a moment's notice to Miami as their escape route, if and when 
life in Haiti becomes unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are going to see a scramble for the airport like you can't imagine," a 
Haitian businessman said. "These people think they have a God-given right to go 
to Miami. Take that away from them and they'll feel helpless." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, embarrassed by reports of the devastating effects 
of economic sanctions on the poor but not the rich here, is moving to close, at 
least partially, the loopholes that had favored the elite and the military 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the U.S. Embassy has recommended to the State Department that 
some of the wealthy, who had been exempted, now be added to a list of Haitians 
prevented from traveling to the United States and that their assets there be 
frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 These individuals had been left off the list, even though they had backed the 
1991 coup, because, as a U.S. official here said, "they had a role to play" in 
resolving the current crisis through their supposed influence with army 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the official, when asked this week to explain the policy shift, said of 
these families, "They seemed to have played out their role." 
</P>
<P>
 State Department sources said news reports of the exemptions "forced the White 
House to act. It was hard to defend letting the Brandts and Madsens (two of the 
most powerful and outspoken families supporting the military) go back and forth 
to Miami while children were seen starving." 
</P>
<P>
 Embassy officials would not disclose the list. But other sources said at least 
three members of the Madsen family had lost visas. And one American source said 
that "it is reasonable to expect that all" the elite families would lose their 
visas, including the Brandt, Madsen, Acra and Mev families. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources also said the United States was seeking to void contracts held by 
these families that enable them to control the import of the food, humanitarian 
aid and medicine exempted under the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 While the air ban would put some strains on individuals and families, the 
major impact would come from the cutoff of financial transactions. As with the 
general sanctions, the pain from Clinton's newest decision would be felt most 
by the poor and the middle class. The move is likely to do little more than 
inconvenience the military and its civilian supporters. It could even enrich 
them, many sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will prevent Haitians in the United States from sending money to their 
families," said a Haitian businessman. These payments, or remittances, amount 
to tens of millions of dollars yearly and are the only source of money for many 
Haitians, especially the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 One businessman observed of the transactions ban: "It will cause a giant leap 
in the currency black market and make the gourde (Haiti's currency) worthless. 
Anyone who has access to dollars will be rich. And who has the most access to 
dollars? The military. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll continue to run the smuggling, drugs and all the other things," he 
added.

LAWMAKERS BRAWL FOR SECOND DAY IN TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputies kicked and punched each other Wednesday in a second day of brawls 
sparked by heated discussions over how many members had to be present to 
conduct business at the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Two opposition deputies were hospitalized for head and arm injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's hourlong brawl broke out after a ruling Nationalist Party officer 
announced the opening of the session when about one-third of the 402 members 
were present. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party wants the quorum 
increased to two-thirds to keep Nationalist members from skipping the lengthy 
sessions.

ONASSIS LEAVES MOST OF ESTATE TO HER CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis left the bulk of her estate to her two children, 
and in a move to guard her privacy even after death instructed them to keep her 
personal papers from ever becoming public. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 36-page will released Wednesday, Mrs. Onassis named longtime companion 
and millionaire financier Maurice Tempelsman as executor of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The document filed in Probate Court in Manhattan reflected the former First 
Lady's strong desire for privacy, directing that her children John F. Kennedy 
Jr. and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg be given her personal papers. But she said 
they must "take whatever action warranted to prevent the display, publication 
or distribution in whole or in part of these papers, letters and writings." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis, 64, died May 19 of lymphatic cancer. She was buried at Arlington 
National Cemetery near Washington next to her slain husband, President John F. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the estate was not disclosed. Mrs. Onassis received $26 million 
from her second husband, Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 She left nothing to her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross. But her sister's son and 
daughter will share the income from a $1-million trust fund for the next 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempelsman, a diamond investor, was left only a statue, described as "my Greek 
alabaster head of a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-room apartment they shared on 5th Avenue will become the property of 
the children, who will also each receive $250,000 in cash and the principal 
from a trust fund established by their father. They were also left the contents 
of the apartment and two pieces of property in Martha's Vineyard in 
Massachusetts.

BOYCOTT CALLED FOR PRODUCTS FROM FIRMS TIED TO RU 486 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Right to Life Committee and other anti-abortion groups Wednesday 
called for a boycott of products made by the companies linked to RU 486, the 
so-called abortion pill that is about to be tested for possible U.S. 
manufacture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not made this decision lightly but feel morally compelled to hold 
these companies accountable," Wanda Franz, president of the National Right to 
Life Committee, said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the coalition of anti-abortion organizations, which also 
includes the Southern Baptist Convention, will take action against Hoechst AG, 
the parent German company; Roussel Uclaf, the French manufacturer of RU 486; 
and two U.S. subsidiaries, Hoechst Celanese, a chemical company, and Hoechst 
Roussel, a pharmaceutical firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of such a boycott by anti-abortion groups is considered 
responsible, in part, for Roussel Uclaf's reluctance to bring the drug to the 
United States during the six years it has been available in France. The other 
major factor was opposition by the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The climate changed after the election of President Clinton, who advocates 
abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz said that her coalition considers the companies "fully responsible," 
despite the French firm's recent decision to give its U.S. patent rights for RU 
486 to the nonprofit Population Council, a reproductive research group based in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The council expects to find a U.S. manufacturer for the pill and plans to 
begin human studies this fall that are expected to last about six months. The 
Food and Drug Administration has pledged to move as quickly as possible to 
evaluate the research and decide whether to license the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The pill removes the risk of surgery and could enable women to have abortions 
without going to abortion clinics, which have been the target of strong 
protests. Prescribed by doctors and taken in the first eight weeks of a 
pregnancy, the pill successfully induces abortion in 96% of the women who take 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz did not name the specific products under boycott but said that a list 
would be released within the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Stine, a spokeswoman for Hoechst Celanese, called the boycott decision 
"misdirected." Hoechst Celanese "was not involved in the negotiations to bring 
RU 486 into this country, nor were we involved in the research, development or 
sales of the drug." 
</P>
<P>
 And Sandra Waldman of the Population Council said that she doubts the boycott 
will have any effect on the process of getting RU 486 into the U.S. 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no lack of companies and organizations interested in this drug," 
she said. "In fact, dozens of companies have expressed interest in various 
aspects -- marketing, distribution, manufacture -- since last year," when the 
council first became involved in negotiations to sponsor the drug in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not frightened by the controversy," she added. "And it certainly 
should not affect a clinical study."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 180; SENATOR QUESTIONS LEGALITY OF 
INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Questioning why a statewide parks bond initiative contains language exempting 
itself from a law he authored, a state senator Wednesday threatened to call for 
a criminal investigation if Proposition 180 passes next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasting the initiative's backers as "gigantic egos who trade on the age-old 
instinct of greed and avarice," state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) 
criticized the Yes on 180 campaign for accepting donations from landowners who 
stand to gain if the measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say they can show that landowners or developers have contributed up 
to $180,000 to help pass the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by voters Tuesday, the measure will be the largest parkland bond 
package in state history. The initiative contains $2 billion worth of 
environmental projects on a list of properties stretching from south of the 
border to the upper reaches of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking about its proponents, Kopp said: "They have no shame. They will take 
money from anyone and any corporation, any entity to satisfy their gigantic 
egos." 
</P>
<P>
 The main backer of the ballot measure, known as CALPAW, dismissed Kopp's 
charges as slanderous hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a political hit -- a last minute, desperate act," said Gerald Meral, 
head of the Planning and Conservation League, which sponsored the initiative 
and has collected more than $2 million to help get it passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is America," Meral said. "It's legal to approach landowners for support. 
They are entitled to sell their land for a fair price. You don't take that 
right away from people." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar but smaller Planning and Conservation League initiative in 1988 won 
voter approval for $776 million worth of park bonds. That measure, Proposition 
70, sparked Kopp's efforts to reform the initiative process. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the league's tactics in gathering support for the 1988 initiative, 
Kopp wrote a law forbidding anyone from including a project in an initiative in 
exchange for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 His statute outlawed a quid-pro-quo practice for initiative backers that, if 
openly used by elected lawmakers, could result in convictions on political 
corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning and Conservation League officials are challenging Kopp's law in the 
courts and said their attorneys advised them, as a safeguard, to include 
wording in the initiative exempting it from the statute's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kopp pledged Wednesday that if the measure passes, he will ask the state 
attorney general's office or the Sacramento district attorney to conduct an 
investigation into whether the league acted properly in writing in an exemption 
from the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we can interest a grand jury into asking questions and making people 
answer them under oath," the state senator said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Meral charged, however, that Kopp's law is unconstitutional because it 
tramples on 1st Amendment rights to free speech in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for his implications that the law was broken, it's slanderous and there is 
no truth to it," Meral said, noting that contributors were not approached until 
after the ballot language was determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Kopp at the news conference were Joel Fox, president of the Howard 
Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., and Henry Agonia, former director of the California 
Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox and Agonia criticized the initiative as fiscally reckless during a time 
when the state has trouble funding critical needs such as education and crime 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox singled out a provision of the initiative that dedicates $2 million for a 
Central American center to study bird migration -- an expenditure that league 
officials say is worthwhile because it would help experts figure out why 
migratory bird populations in California are dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it a wise use of California taxpayers' money to build a $2-million bird 
sanctuary in Central America instead of spending that money in South-Central 
Los Angeles?" Fox asked.

BODY FOUND BURIED IN BACK YARD WAS MAN, 68, WHO LIVED IN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Bernardino County coroner's office has confirmed that a body unearthed 
behind a home in Montclair was that of a 68-year-old man who lived there, and 
police say the victim's sons kept the corpse in a freezer for several days 
before burying him. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of John Sullivan Sr.'s death has not been determined, Montclair 
police said Wednesday.Detectives said that until their investigation is 
completed, no charges will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair police Lt. Kevin Piper said detectives believe that Sullivan died in 
July, 1993. The detectives say Sullivan's sons -- John Sullivan Jr., 26, and 
Brian Sullivan, 29 -- stored the body in a freezer in their decrepit home on 
Saratoga Avenue for several days while preparing a burial site beneath a pine 
tree in a corner of their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The body was buried in the early morning hours on a date in late July, 1993," 
Piper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's disappearance was not noted by police until last month, when 
Brian Sullivan's arrest on suspicion of forgery led investigators to suspect 
that several of John Sullivan Sr.'s Social Security checks had been cashed 
fraudulently. 
</P>
<P>
 When the sons were unable to account for their father's whereabouts, police 
started digging in the back yard. The body was found May 18.

OFFICERS HOPE THEIR ORDEAL IS OVER 
</P>

<P>
 For three years, the officers of the Foothill Police Division have lingered in 
a purgatory, in which nearly every mention of the Rodney G. King controversy 
pointed back to their doorstep in the east San Fernando Valley, where their 
colleagues subdued King with batons. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter the changes they made -- all the community-based policing efforts in 
the face of taunts and barbs from the community they serve, all the promises to 
do better -- the taint of the King scandal has been inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the King case has been like a black cloud hanging low over the 
time-worn police station on Osborne Street, than perhaps the jury verdict 
Wednesday was the first glimmer of sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps now, some Foothill officers said Wednesday with evident relief, the 
King case and their links to it can soon be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "March 3, 1991, is finally behind us," Patrol Capt. Bob Gale said. "We won't 
have to live it day in and day out." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years and three months, Gale said, it has been almost 
impossible for the 241 sworn officers and 320 civilians of Foothill Division to 
do their jobs without being reminded of the incident in which several of their 
colleagues subdued King after a high-speed chase by raining baton blows upon 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The station's officers have been stung so many times in the past by questions 
about the incident that they are bitter, and skittish. Few would discuss it at 
all Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great. My view is (King) doesn't deserve anything," said Officer Jeff 
Hart, as he maneuvered his patrol car out of the station. "Those police 
officers did what they had to do to go home safe that night, and the citizens 
and the media destroyed this department for it. And (King) got his $3.8 million 
from the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the King beating, Hart said, "We've caught flak on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the finest Police Department in the world, and now it seems like 
we're second-best." 
</P>
<P>
 Defendant Timothy Wind, fired from Foothill after the beating, was less 
optimistic when asked Wednesday if he thought the verdicts marked the end of 
his ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the King case. It's never over with," he said. "It's made a wreck of our 
lives, a wreck of the city and of our profession." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the King beating, the station hard by the barrios and housing projects 
of the northeast valley has seen 70% of its officers and leaders transferred to 
make way for newcomers, including many more women and minority officers. New 
policies have been instituted, new leaders appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker was dispatched northward to command all 
San Fernando Valley police divisions immediately after the King incident, to 
mend fences with an embittered minority community while holding together the 
police rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker's reforms slowly made Foothill a model of the new community-based 
policing ethic, so much so that he was recently sent to South-Central Los 
Angeles to expand on the work. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite all the changes in personnel and policies, Kroeker recalled 
Wednesday night, the ghosts of the King incident made it hard to concentrate on 
almost anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot remember in my 30 years (on the force) working harder, putting in 
longer hours, and just thinking, 'We need to get past this,' thinking, 'Man, 
how many hurdles are on the track?' " Kroeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill officers said that every time someone was ticketed by police or 
arrested, "the incident" was thrown in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kroeker, Gale said a lot of good has come from the King incident, 
including a heightened awareness of the suspicions with which many in the 
community viewed police. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the case actually has ended, Kroeker suggested the Wednesday jury 
verdict was at least an important symbolic milestone -- the end of the public 
airing of the actions of the police on that fateful night three summers ago. "I 
don't think anyone is gloating about this," Kroeker said. "I think they are 
saying this has been the last train station in this whole ugly journey. So much 
rancor, so much bitterness." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a preoccupation that has kept us in a sea of negativity when we 
desperately need to focus on the future," Kroeker said. "Now maybe we can move 
on, hold our head up and create a pretty good future here."

 The American Civil Liberties Union announced Tuesday that it will appeal a 
federal judge's ruling that Livingston schools do not have to let Sikh students 
wear knives called kirpans. 
</P>
<P>
 Baptized Sikhs must wear kirpans as part of their religious tradition. But 
U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell of Sacramento ruled Friday that the 
ceremonial knives would impose an undue disruption of the district's schools 
and students.

SCIENTIST FINDS FLAW IN TOUTED 'CLIPPER CHIP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A computer scientist has discovered a basic flaw in coding technology that the 
Clinton Administration has been promoting as a standard for electronic 
communications, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Blaze, a researcher at AT&T Bell Laboratories, told the New York Times 
his research had shown that someone with sufficient computer skills can beat 
the government's technology by encoding messages so that no one, not even the 
government, can crack them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been urging private industry to adopt the "Clipper 
chip" as a standard encoding system. The government says telephone and computer 
messages sent with the chip cannot be read by an outsider but can be decoded by 
government law-enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaze said the flaw he discovered in the Clipper design would not permit a 
third party to break a coded computer conversation. But it would enable two 
people to have a secret conversation that law enforcement could not unscramble.

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: LIFE IN THE FAST-BUCK LANE: ENOUGH ALREADY! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'll admit this much: Nobody who came to Irvine Meadows to see the Eagles got 
ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
 But anybody who thinks that rock music should stand for something besides 
business as usual got let down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles sized up their market and set their price. Some 75,000 people paid 
it, and tens of thousands more probably would have done the same if there had 
been enough tickets to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a classic scenario from Economics 101: pent-up demand (these were the 
reunited band's first tour dates in 14 years) and limited supply (a five-night 
stand at the 15,000-capacity amphitheater) conspired to drive prices up. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the ticket prices were unprecedented for a rock concert that was not 
a benefit: $115 for orchestra seats, $75 for seats in the two higher tiers, and 
$35 for a spot on the lawn. Those were the face values. Ticket brokers were 
asking more than $80 for the lawn, and more than $500 for the front rows. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the Eagles delivered a long, sharply played, well-sung performance 
that, aside from the omission of a couple of their early hits, should have been 
enough to meet the expectations of any confirmed fan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles played the system the way the business textbooks say it's supposed 
to be played: A desirable product, skillfully wrought and painstakingly 
presented, yielded an economic triumph to the tune of approximately $1 million 
a night in gross ticket receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that rock 'n' roll is supposed to be more than grease for the economic 
wheels. It is supposed to be popular music in the broadest sense: a music of 
the people, priced in a way that is not patently unfair to the teen-aged 
burger-flipper, the college student pressed by rising fees, the sales clerk or 
medical office assistant, the cop or the machinist. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the urge for short-term profit maximization in American 
business is putting good, hard-working people out of work, we need respected 
voices to call for moderation, to remind us that not all value should be 
measured in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles had a chance to deliver that idealistic message without sacrifice, 
simply by charging the going rate for a top-of-the-line rock show. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hefty but not unusual average ticket price of $30, they could have 
grossed $450,000 a night. Even writing off half the take to promoters' fees, 
venue rental, crew salaries and other overhead expenses, each of the five band 
members would, in one night , have earned more than the national median annual 
family income of $39,700. And that doesn't count their cut from merchandising, 
concessions, Ticketmaster fees, and whatever other lucrative add-ons might have 
been in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Eagles went for that cool million at the box office. The average 
ticket price of $67.85 sent the message that self-restraint and a healthy sense 
of moderation are for saps. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget all that communitarian, music-for-the-people stuff. What counts is to 
set up the big score, then press your advantage as hard and as ruthlessly as 
you can. After all, it's a free market, and if the market supports it, then it 
must be OK. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles are not the only offenders. Rod Stewart was the first rocker to hit 
the $100-ticket mark in Orange County, with his April shows at The Pond of 
Anaheim. Traffic is commanding $65 for a top seat at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand played the game of supply and demand even more avidly than 
the Eagles, pricing her Pond shows at $350, $125 and $50. But Streisand is no 
rocker, with the messy populist and egalitarian antecedents and agenda that a 
rock heritage entails. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a pop diva, the cultivator of a cult of personality, and she comes from 
a Broadway tradition in which the audience is expected to pay royally for the 
privilege of a regal presence. 
</P>
<P>
 One favorite argument in favor of pricing prime concert tickets at $50 or more 
is that scalpers get far more than that, so why shouldn't the promoter and 
artist reap something closer to the ticket's actual market value? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That is a persuasive argument if the assumed aim of a rock concert is profit 
maximization. But if you buy the notion that pricing structures should reflect 
rock's populist traditions and take into account average people's ability to 
pay, you don't join the scalpers; you fight them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket scalping should remain exactly what it is: a distortion of the market 
that exists because a substantial number of people with too much money or too 
much zeal are willing to pay unreasonable prices for the entertainment they 
covet. Artists and promoters who use this distortion of the market as an excuse 
to redefine the market upward are making it impossible for anyone to buy a good 
seat at a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a simple way to determine a populist price ceiling for rock concert 
tickets: Gear the cost of a ticket to the cost of a record album. 
</P>
<P>
 The average compact disc contains about 50 minutes of music and retails for 
$14 or $15. Therefore, the average 100-minute rock concert should carry a top 
ticket price of $28 or $30 (artists playing longer shows should be generous and 
throw in their encores for free rather than push prices higher). 
</P>
<P>
 An even better way for rockers to show solidarity with their audiences would 
be to gear prices to the prevailing wage in a community. If the average worker 
makes $12 an hour, bands might consider setting ticket prices at $24 for a 
two-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
 At these rates, rock stars won't go poor. By running their careers under 
principles that shun the big score and take into account the economic 
limitations that most of their audience has to live with every day, rock stars 
could make something of their tours besides business as usual. That would raise 
their worth in a way that can't be achieved in a box office bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it would help if rock fans could also develop a sense of 
moderation and proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 One way is to remember that it isn't a disaster if you miss a concert by your 
favorite big name. Set limits on what you'll spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way is to realize that some of the most fulfilling rock 'n' roll 
experiences are not big-dollar events by household names. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep my own sense of proportion during this blitz of Eagles this and 
Streisand that, I went to see the Missiles of October last Thursday night. The 
venue was the Marine Room Tavern, a clean, comfortable and very cozy bar in 
Laguna Beach. The cover charge was $2 for a three-hour performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Missiles are four veteran Orange County players who all began their 
careers in the early 1970s, around the same time the Eagles were getting 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Poul Finn Pederson, Bob Hawkins, Frank Cotinola and Jimmy Perez may be fated 
to earn their livings in small local bars rather than arenas and amphitheaters. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are lucky, the Missiles' regimen of three or four shows a week enables 
them to scratch out a livelihood somewhere on the lower fringes of the middle 
class. In terms of pride and skill, though, I don't think they give away 
anything to the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Henley is a remarkable singer -- but so is Pederson, who through the three 
45-minute sets I saw did not stint on soulfulness or intensity. Hawkins is a 
marvelous guitar player. While I enjoyed most of Don Felder's playing, and some 
of Joe Walsh's, I'm not sure either of the Eagles' lead guitarists could top 
the unflagging flow of tasteful, inventive playing that Hawkins mustered almost 
as a matter of routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Missiles don't have a record out, let alone any hit songs, so they play 
bars like the Marine Room (Thursday nights and Sunday afternoons, (714) 
494-3027 -- and the Old Town Mexican Cafe in Dana Point (Friday nights, (714) 
496-2560). 
</P>
<P>
 But they do have legitimate hopes of getting out of the bar scene and onto a 
national touring circuit. If Henley and Glenn Frey were to come up with a song 
as strong as the Pederson original "Look at Daddy Run" or "Bad Seeds," a song 
that Eagles songwriting associate Jack Tempchin directed to the Missiles, I 
don't think the Eagles would throw it back. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big world doesn't know about that. Not yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we feel like we're just another bar band, and we have to remind 
ourselves that we're not," Pederson told me during a break. 
</P>
<P>
 Sit through a few Missiles sets, and their adventurous interpretation of 
well-chosen, never-obvious cover material can become a graduate seminar in 
intelligent rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, Pederson called tunes by Richard Thompson, John Prine, NRBQ, 
John Hiatt, Bob Dylan and Bruce Cockburn. The band served up zestful R&B, 
rocketing country-rock, and reinvented Willie Dixon's swaggering blues boast, 
"Seventh Son," as a deeply felt folk-ballad lament. There wasn't a lot of 
talking in the bar, because the tug of the music was strong. 
</P>
<P>
 During a funky version of the subdudes' "Poverty," four women formed an 
impromptu chorus line along the back wall, doing Motown-style dance steps. They 
were high-school teachers from San Juan Capistrano, three of them first-timers 
who had come to see the Missiles on a tip from the fourth, a Marine Room 
regular. 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher named Tracy (they were shy about giving their last names, not 
wanting to be pegged as revelers on a school night) said one of her colleagues 
had come in with the attitude that great rock doesn't happen in humble places. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'I feel like I'm slumming.' And then she got caught up." 
</P>
<P>
 Try it. 
</P>
<P>
 World-class local talents like the Missiles of October, Chris Gaffney, Jann 
Browne, Walter Trout, Eli Riddle, James Harman and Joyride are out there, 
playing for cheap and playing well. You, too, might get caught up in the 
pleasures of discovering a rare talent for a couple of bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 You might find that these easily accessible local alternatives make things a 
lot easier to take when the laws of supply and demand cut you out of the 
superstar concert market. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time some high-flying rock band wants you to shell out $115 or $75 
for a seat and $35 for a steeply sloping patch of grass (not to mention 
Ticketmaster's onerous processing fees), you'll know where to tell it to go. 
And you'll know where you can go instead.

MOVE OVER, WOODWARD & BERNSTEIN; RADIO: EXPOSING WATERGATE WAS EASY COMPARED TO 
EXPOSING YOURSELF TO HOWARD STERN FOR THE SAKE OF DISCUSSING HIS LATEST TV 
DEAL. 
</P>

 First he makes fun of your last name. Then he asks all manner of racy, 
personal questions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just another morning for Howard Stern in the pursuit of lively radio. But 
for this reporter, granted an "exclusive interview" on the air, it was about as 
much fun as having a root canal. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stern turns his quick wit and dirty mind your way, the natural instinct 
is to run for cover. Especially when the self-proclaimed "king of all media" 
regally demands that his media subjects conduct interviews on his terms -- in 
this case live, on the air and at an ungodly pre-dawn hour (because of the time 
difference between here and New York, where he broadcasts). 
</P>
<P>
 The "exclusive" opportunity I was granted -- after four years of requesting a 
personal interview and being turned down -- was really just another instance of 
Stern making unabashed use of the media for self-promotional purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, it was Howard being Howard in the most Howardly way he knows 
how. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion Wednesday was Stern's announcement to his radio listeners of a 
deal he'd made to do a daily series for the E! Entertainment Television cable 
network. Stern deigned to put up with some questions from a reporter for the 
greater good of celebrating "the start of something amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be nice to have somebody from the media on the phone with 
us to listen in on my big news who could ask intelligent questions," Stern 
explained on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 He was much more interested in my anatomy than my questions, it turned out. 
This much I did learn: The cable show will simply be a televised version of his 
radio show and is part of a larger development deal Stern has with E! All five 
hours of his popular syndicated morning program will be videotaped each weekday 
by six robotic cameras, then a half-hour will be culled for showing on the 
cable network that night. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 45 minutes on the air with Stern -- it seemed an eternity -- there 
still remained some confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The E! series might be called "The Howard Stern Show With Pictures" or "The 
Howard Stern Radio Show on Television" or even "Howard Stern on the Air." 
There's no telling. It might debut June 13. Then again, the launch date may be 
June 20. No one is quite sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern and sidekick Robin Quivers at least were honest about what the E! deal 
entailed: "We get to do television without any extra work," Quivers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And doing it on a major network is too easy," Stern quipped. "I wanted the 
challenge of E!, where nobody can see us." 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to make a serious case about being persecuted by the Federal 
Communications Commission. He tried to explain why he couldn't come to terms 
with Fox for a late-night talk show. He tried to describe how the film version 
of his best-seller "Private Parts" would make him a movie star. He tried to 
find out my bra size. 
</P>
<P>
 After it was over, with nothing terribly personal revealed and Stern 
respectfully admitting that I had always been fair to him, I breathed a sigh of 
relief. I even began to think I might have managed to emerge from the 
experience with some dignity intact. 
</P>
<P>
 My peace of mind was shattered when I got to the office and heard the first 
message on my voice mail: A representative of the 509th squadron of the Air 
Force, stationed in Lakeland, Fla., said he and some 50 other guys had heard me 
on the show and wanted to know if I could send them an 8x10 glossy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush Limbaugh would never have put me through this.

Q&A ; REVISITING A CLASSIC ACTOR AND FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alfred Hitchcock once dubbed Gregory Peck "the most anecdoteless man in 
Hollywood." But Hitch, it turns out, was dead wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 On a recent sunny afternoon, the legendary actor padded around the lavish 
living room of his sprawling Holmby Hills home offering iced tea. "If you like 
pictures, and I can tell that you do, you might like to take a look at this 
one," he intones with the voice that is part granite, part velvet. He switches 
the light on a stunning Renoir of red roses. Peck studies the painting as if 
for the first time. "He (Renoir) was able to be passionate about a bunch of 
flowers," he says. "It's brimming with life."  
</P>
<P>
 As is its owner. At 78, Peck continues to exude the charismatic elegance that 
was his trademark through films like "To Kill a Mockingbird," "Roman Holiday," 
"Spellbound," "Captain Horatio Hornblower," "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" and 
1961's "The Guns of Navarone," the action-adventure favorite being revived on 
the big screen Friday through June 9. The film will be shown with a new 70mm 
print and remastered soundtracks at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, helping 
mark the Columbia Classics Festival.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the actor lives amid elegant splendor with his wife of 38 years, 
Veronique. There are impeccable French antiques and collected works of Picasso, 
Matisse and Toulouse-Lautrec. But also dropped unapologetically in the middle 
of the meticulously groomed lawn is a large swing set. "Oh, that's for Zach," 
he says, referring to his 2 1/2-year-old grandson, the youngest of his four 
grandkids. At the edge of the garden are two large, fake black and white cows. 
And the cows are for the grandchildren as well? "No," says Peck, smiling. 
"They're for me."  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Peck broke his rule of never reminiscing as he reflected on his 
life, his passions and the bygone days of Navarone, not to mention Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: In one chilling scene in "The Guns of Navarone," you have to scale 
one of the world's most treacherous mountains. Exactly how was that filmed? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: (Laughs, pointing to a flat surface on the glass table.) I was only 
crawling up something about that steep. There was a stuntman who did a hard 
climb on a sheer cliff somewhere, which was intercut with Tony (Quinn) and me 
faking it, crawling up a papier-mache cliff. We filmed on the Greek island of 
Rhodes but went to England to do the interior scenes. The studio was not about 
to have anything tripped up by having two expensive actors climbing a steep 
cliff.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What memories do you have of converging on that Greek island? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It was a beautiful place. We went off to our locations in the morning. I 
remember that we had several chess games going because there was a lot of 
waiting time while they moved the camera over rugged terrain. I would be 
playing Tony (Quinn), and (Anthony) Quayle would be playing (David) Niven. It 
was a very congenial group. We actually, I think, all had the sense that it was 
not a serious war picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It was a swashbuckler. We were doing impossible things. You don't want to 
do it tongue-in-cheek because the audience wants to enjoy the obstacle course. 
If the Germans are chasing us and we run to the right, they're going to run to 
the left. It's a little bit like Buster Keaton.  
</P>
<P>
 I remember, we were filming in the countryside one day and I was thumbing 
through the script and looking at the stuff we had to do next, and something 
dawned on me: I wanted to tease (producer and screenwriter) Carl Foreman. So I 
said: "Carl, you and I both know that this is not about blowing up those guns." 
He said: "No? What's it about?" Then I said: "Niven loves Quayle. Peck loves 
Quinn. Quayle breaks his leg and has to go to the hospital, Quinn falls in love 
with a girl (Irene Papas). . . . Niven and Peck catch each other on the rebound 
and live happily ever after!" He said: "You son of a bitch!" But this is what 
you call personal relationships -- the old love story between strong men. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That's certainly a progressive point of view for 1961. In "The Guns of 
Navarone," as with so many of your other films, you exude a certain strength, 
yet underneath is an underlying passion. What are the passions of Gregory Peck 
today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The passions? The first thing that comes into my head is my family: How are 
my kids doing? Is my wife happy? Are we happy as a family? Are we moving in a 
good direction? After that, it would be friends. We still love to travel; our 
credentials as globetrotters are pretty good.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think about Hollywood today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: So much of the Establishment moviemaking is calculated as really light 
entertainment, including the violence and the special effects. It is basically 
light entertainment, extremely well done -- technically. But you don't carry 
anything away with you. Maybe you had a couple of hours, like a ride at Magic 
Mountain, that took you over the hills and rode you around. "Jurassic Park" is 
maybe the best example of that kind of movie. But the pictures that I have a 
feeling for are quite different. The most recent ones I liked were "Belle 
Epoque" and "Like Water for Chocolate." They are passionate to tell a story 
that they are in love with and to play those characters.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The infrastructure and the power in Hollywood have changed over the years. 
Now we have corporate raiders greenlighting movies instead of the Jack Warners 
of yesterday. From your perspective, how has that changed the business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, it's obvious that when Darryl Zanuck was calling all of the shots, 
the pictures reflected his taste and his judgment and his interests. You never 
had the sense that he was making a picture by committee. You knew that it was 
Zanuck's decision. Nowadays, you don't know who you're working for. They do all 
of these test screenings, pushing buttons when they're interested and when 
they're not.  
</P>
<P>
 I made a couple of pictures back in 1946 and the last few weeks, their filming 
overlapped: "The Yearling" and "Duel in the Sun." They were made for about $4 
million. But they were big pictures and those were big budgets. I don't think 
Clark Gable ever made over $3,500 a week.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've heard that you detest the word retire , and yet your last films were 
"The Old Gringo" in 1989 and a cameo in "Cape Fear" in 1991. What is it going 
to take to get you to make another picture? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, I could be passionate about the right story with the right character. 
But on the other hand, I am not pining away to jump in front of the cameras 
just to keep busy.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What actors in particular would you like to work with?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Harrison Ford, Michael Keaton, Tom Hanks, Tommy Lee Jones. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And actresses? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, they're mostly a little young for me! Maybe Jessica Tandy! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are you different from your screen persona? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not nearly as confident as those hero characters are. Although I think 
in films like "Twelve O'Clock High" and "The Guns of Navarone," it seemed to me 
that I brought in a little ambivalence of character and vulnerability and 
self-doubt whenever there was an opening for it. But am I like these heroes in 
real life? No. Sometimes I've been courageous and sometimes less so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been offered over a million dollars to write your autobiography and 
yet you've refused to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you know (Irving) Lazar was offering everybody a million-dollar 
advance! But I'm not going to do it. I'm reminiscing quite a bit with you 
today, but ordinarily I don't. My dear pal Fred Astaire, he hated nostalgia. He 
would not talk about the old times or the great days at MGM. He was crabbier 
than I am. (Laughter.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have a guiding philosophy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'll answer that indirectly. At a dinner the other night at friends', a 
well-known, beautiful lady in her 40s who has had a couple of unsuccessful 
marriages was saying: "Oh, what should I do to find a man? I want to fall in 
love." She said to me: "What do you think?" I said: "Find a man who serves 
humanity." She looked at me and said: "What? " (Laughter.) I said: "I think 
they are the happiest people -- doctors, research scientists, teachers, 
artists. One way or another you have to serve humanity to be occasionally 
happy; no one is always happy."

APPRECIATION; BETTY ASHER: AN ARTFUL EVOLUTION; THE ART COLLECTOR, CURATOR AND 
DEALER HELPED SHAPE CULTURE IN POSTWAR LOS ANGELES. SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED 
TONIGHT IN A MEMORIAL TRIBUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Betty Asher was a triple threat. As an art collector for more than 40 years, a 
curatorial assistant at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for 13 years 
(1966-79) and a gallery owner for 11 years (1979-90), her accumulated 
experience with modern and contemporary art outpaced that of just about anyone 
else in the city. Her death May 11 at the age of 80 marks a passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly that passage will be remembered tonight in a memorial tribute to be 
held at 6:30 in LACMA's Bing Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, it marks a passage because Asher was once a rare breed, an active 
figure among a relatively small coterie of aficionados who hunker down together 
to try to make a difference (or, perhaps, maintain their sanity), as they do in 
most American cities where art in general, and contemporary art in particular, 
is regarded with suspicion or, more likely, genial indifference. By stark 
contrast to her early years, the Southern California art scene Asher left 
behind three weeks ago ranks among the handful of the most significant in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher is one of many reasons for the dramatic change. When she moved from 
Chicago to Los Angeles in 1941, her own artistic interests were ragged and 
unformed, and they stayed that way for quite some time. In the 1950s and 1960s, 
however, Los Angeles was rapidly becoming the principal engine that defined 
popular American culture for a burgeoning postwar generation. In two respects, 
Betty Asher seemed to have plugged right into that developing ethos. 
</P>
<P>
 First, when she began to buy art in an ambitious way in the 1960s, she had a 
special affinity for Pop art. Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Edward Ruscha 
-- they remained among her favorite artists. Yes, she acquired abstract 
painting and sculpture by Frank Stella and Donald Judd, too, but it was Stella 
at his most neon of moments and Judd at his flashiest and most glamorously 
sleek. Think of the nested florescent squares of the former and the stacks of 
aluminum and colored plexiglass of the latter as a kind of "abstract Pop." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, there was her now-legendary collection of ceramic cups (much of which 
now resides at LACMA). The collection, which eventually grew to number in the 
hundreds, also got under way in the 1960s, with the acquisition of some useful 
coffee mugs made by sculptor Kenneth Price. 
</P>
<P>
 For an ostensibly serious collector of painting and sculpture to 
simultaneously develop a collection of funky cups gives one pause. It is to 
come awfully close to indulging in a wallow in junior high school kitsch. A cup 
collection is one step away from an adolescent establishing some identity by 
hoarding porcelain pigs from strip-mall gift shops, or by amassing souvenir 
thermometers from global tourist destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is, of course, the point. The Pop edge of the practice is unmistakable 
(remember Andy Warhol's cookie jars?). It's revealing, too, because it blurs 
typically class-bound distinctions between being a determined art collector and 
being a committed art hobbyist. Passion is passion, Asher's ever-growing cup 
collection said; get into it. 
</P>
<P>
 For an art collector/curator/dealer in postwar Los Angeles, the cups' 
connection to a tradition of crafts also claims a subtle significance. In the 
mid-1950s, a period noted in L.A. more for a conservative hostility toward art 
than for any respect for the few exceptional artists actually at work here, the 
most important event was the establishment of a ceramics workshop by Peter 
Voulkos at the Otis Art Institute. Otis Clay, as the work of Voulkos and his 
students and colleagues has come to be called, achieved a small revolution by 
radically subverting the most traditional medium imaginable. Ever since, a 
critically interpreted crafts aesthetic has been of recurring importance to 
some of the most adventurous art made here. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a famous photograph of Marcel Duchamp taken in Las Vegas in 1963, at 
the time the French Dadaist was having his landmark retrospective at the old 
Pasadena Art Museum. Seated with him in a booth among a group of revelers was 
Betty Asher. It seems fitting that the artist who had led the modern European 
philosophical inquiry into the nature of art would inspire a soon-to-be notable 
American collector of Pop art and eccentric cups. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect it seems fitting in another way, for Asher harbored another 
passion. Aside from art or cups, she was also a fanatic for playing poker. 
Looking at that photograph of Asher together in Las Vegas with Duchamp, who had 
supposedly retired from making art 30 years before to devote his life to 
playing the game of chess, can make you think that poker became her 
all-American version of his fascination with playing the odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchamp labored toward checkmate, in time-honored European fashion, but Betty 
Asher was on the prowl for a royal flush. I'd say she got it.

MEET THE ICE COLD KING OF GAGSTA RAP; RUSTY CUNDIEFF'S 'FEAR OF A BLACK HAT' 
WAS INSPIRED BY 'SPINAL TAP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rob Reiner's 1984 rock-documentary parody film "This Is Spinal Tap" inspired 
many of those who saw it to retell some of its best bits, like its gags about 
exploding drummers, but for actor-screenwriter Rusty Cundieff, it did much 
more. It inspired him to make his own movie spoof. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a big fan of 'Spinal Tap,' " says Cundieff, 29, during a midmorning 
interview at a diner near his Los Feliz home, adding that he has seen the film 
at least 11 times. "It's truly, truly awesome. It's one of the best parodies -- 
it's so subtle." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie Cundieff directed, wrote and starred in, "Fear of a Black Hat," 
which opens Friday in selected theaters, spoofs rap the way "Spinal Tap" spoofs 
rock, and it's often as funny as its inspiration. Much as Reiner's film tracks 
the career of a hard-rock band, "Fear of a Black Hat" follows the exploits of 
the fictitious hard-core rap group N.W.H. (the "H" stands for hats) and its 
members, Tone Def, Tasty-Taste and Ice Cold, who is played by Cundieff. 
</P>
<P>
 Cundieff, an actor and stand-up comedian, decided he wanted to direct a rap 
parody movie in 1990 after members of 2 Live Crew were arrested in Florida for 
performing songs from "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." They were later found not 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed like a ridiculous thing," Cundieff says. "The (First Amendment 
issue) was important, but it was ridiculous the way it came about. . . . The 
idea was to do a film like 'Spinal Tap' that had a group of rappers who were on 
death row for obscenity (charges)." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear" eventually evolved into a broad parody of hip-hop culture that spares 
few rappers and few rap conventions. The pseudo-mystical Tone Def sounds 
suspiciously like Prince B. of PM Dawn; minor characters Vanilla Sherbet and MC 
Slammer have obvious real-life counterparts; and the more one knows about rap, 
the more inside jokes one can spot. In a nod to "Spinal Tap," the group's 
managers -- rather than drummers -- die under mysterious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie plays on a few different levels," Cundieff says. "People who are 
really into rap and understand the business get one area of it. People who 
aren't into rap laugh at it, but in an entirely different way. People who are 
really into rap, and seriously take it as real, don't like the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that a lot of people don't seem to realize is that rap is a 
performance, just like anything else. . . . It's kind of scary when people take 
the lyric to a song and turn it into a political frame of mind: 'OK, we are 
basing our dogma on this: "Fight the Power." ' The song is a great song . . . 
but you hope the people will go beyond that."  
</P>
<P>
 Making "Fear" not only gave Cundieff his first chance to direct, but it also 
gave the longtime rap fan his first chance to grab the microphone himself -- he 
does some of the rapping on the movie's soundtrack, a collection of N.W.H. 
songs that includes "My Peanuts," a send-up of Run DMC's song "My Adidas," and 
the group's controversial hit "(Expletive) the Security Guards." About two 
weeks ago, he went into the studio to cut a new track for a soon-to-be-released 
video by Ice Cold's newest persona -- controversial gangsta rapper Ice Froggy 
Frog. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Cundieff pokes fun at hip-hop's cliches, he seems to have a genuine 
love of the music, which he started listening to in the early 1980s while 
growing up in Pittsburgh. After graduating from USC, he started doing stand-up 
comedy and acting. After appearing in a small role in Spike Lee's "School 
Daze," Cundieff decided he wanted to write and direct. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spike was really influential," Cundieff says. "Any time anyone had a problem 
with what he was doing, he'd say: 'If you don't like it, direct it yourself.' 
It made total sense to me."  
</P>
<P>
 Cundieff and "Fear" producer Darin Scott -- a big "Spinal Tap" fan and a 
friend of Cundieff's -- used $600 they won gambling on a trip to Las Vegas to 
make a 20-minute video version of the movie they could shop around to 
production companies. Though none were immediately interested -- partly because 
the rap-oriented comedy "CB4" was being shopped around at the same time -- ITC 
picked up the movie in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The film premiered at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival and was well received, 
but internal changes at ITC delayed the film for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the delay affects how the film does at the box office, Scott still 
regards "Fear" as a success because it helped the two land other projects, 
including "Tales From the Hood," an urban suspense anthology they co-wrote, 
which will be produced by Spike Lee. "No matter how well it does at the box 
office, it's already (done well) for us," Scott says of "Fear." "We're making 
more movies."

COME ON, DANCERS -- LET THE BON TEMPS ROLL; PARTIES: A NEW SOCIAL CLUB IS 
INTRODUCING REGULAR CAJUN AND ZYDECO EVENTS WITH LESSONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Don't know how to fais-do-do ? Then you're just the candidate Herb Hickle is 
looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickle is co-founder of the new Bon Temps Social Club of Orange County, which 
has begun to sponsor local Cajun and zydeco dances, also known as fais-do-do s, 
a Cajun-French term for dance parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's live music events will be held this year on the fifth Fridays of 
July, September and December at Anaheim's Ebell Club and on the third Friday of 
each month in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The club will also stage a fund-raiser dance Friday in Long Beach featuring 
Louisiana accordionist-fiddler Steve Riley and his band, the Mamou Playboys. 
Riley's group also is one of a half-dozen acts playing the annual Southern 
California Cajun & Zydeco Festival this weekend in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just really felt there was a need for more Cajun dances in Orange County," 
said Hickle, who has regularly attended similar dances at the Women's Club of 
Orange and others in Los Angeles, Pasadena and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The dances should give touring bands -- which the club plans to book -- more 
incentive to visit the greater L.A. area, Hickle said. 
</P>
<P>
 He particularly wants to bring in more zydeco, the Creole-influenced form of 
Cajun music that offers listeners and dancers a peppier rhythm. "It's faster 
and more vigorous, and you dance closer to your partner," said the San Clemente 
resident, who visits New Orleans three times a year.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hickle, a county transportation employee, formed the club earlier this year, 
around Mardi Gras time, with friends Debbie and Phil Curnutt. Their Anaheim 
Ebell dance will include Cajun and zydeco two-step and waltz lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Cajun-zydeco music fan whose great-grandmother was French Canadian, 
Hickle took his first Cajun dance lesson two years ago and "was hooked," he 
said. "I don't think think I've missed a Cajun dance since." 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the jazz festival in New Orleans," he continued. "It took me 38 
hours to drive there, but once I got there and heard the music and started 
dancing, it felt like I had slept all the way, it was such a charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the Bon Temps club hopes to sponsor Saturday and Sunday night 
dances, although finding an appropriate hall has been difficult, Hickle said. 
The group wants to rent a room with a wooden floor large enough to accommodate 
about 150 people, and to pay no more than $250 per night. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for the dances -- the club has an 800-name mailing list -- is part 
of a trend that has swing joints and country nightclubs hopping like the French 
Quarter before Lent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see it," he said, "there's a real surge and interest in couple 
dancing. But so many country-Western places are jammed, we hope people will 
explore something new." 
</P>
<P>
 * Steve Riley & the Mamou Playboys and the Brand New Old-Time Cajun Band play 
Friday at the Elks Lodge, Grand Ballroom, 4101 E. Willow St., Long Beach. 7:30 
p.m. $8 to $10; children under 17 with adults are free . Cajun Hot Line: (714) 
490-3838. Sponsored by the Bon Temps Social Club of Orange County.

CLOSE'S LARYNGITIS HAS 'SUNSET' TICKET-HOLDERS SCRAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 After missing just four performances out of about 200 since opening last 
December as Norma Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard," Glenn Close has been forced to 
cancel seven performances due to laryngitis within the past week. Her absence 
has led to some audience frustration and last-minute scrambling to exchange 
tickets in order to see the star in her final month with the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Close has missed seven-and-a- half performances -- last Saturday, 
Close's health sidelined her mid-show. At intermission she came onstage to 
announce that understudy Karen Mason would perform in the second act. 
</P>
<P>
 Close's final performance is scheduled for June 26, and she is slated to open 
in the Broadway production in November. Mason, who has stepped in for all of 
Close's missed performances, will fill in June 28-July 3. Close will be 
replaced by Faye Dunaway July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Shubert is offering patrons exchanges or refunds, show 
representatives acknowledge that finding good seats for remaining shows by 
Close is difficult. The actress's publicist, Catherine Olim, said that Close's 
ability to perform can only be predicted "day by day." "Obviously, she'd like 
to be up and singing as soon as possible," Olim said. 
</P>
<P>
 While no specific attendance figures are available, "Sunset" spokesman Rick 
Miramontez said that for the week ending May 29, box-office gross was $867,723 
-- down from $879,085 the previous week, before Close became ill. He estimated 
there had been 100 to 200 exchanges or cancellations per performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Lowe, a contractor from San Jose, and his wife, Melissa, flew to Los 
Angeles Tuesday, only to find that Mason, not Close, would be onstage. "We 
thought about getting our money back, but to see it again we would have had to 
fly home and come back again," he said by phone from LAX. He liked what he saw, 
and said Mason received a standing ovation. "I didn't want to see her at all 
but . . . we just decided to go with what's there. I don't remember the girl's 
name, but she looked just like Gloria Swanson, with all the little hand 
mannerisms. And she had a very strong voice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason termed her sudden call to duty "a shock to the system," but said she has 
been pleased by her reception. "I don't even listen to the announcement (that 
she is stepping in for Close) -- I don't like to hear the groaning," she said. 
"But after the first number, they seem to think they are in OK hands. They have 
responded beautifully."

 A former prosecutor was given a suspended prison sentence Wednesday for 
beating a witness during questioning in a major bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo District Court sentenced Hitoshi Kanazawa, 33, to two years in 
prison but suspended the sentence for four years, meaning he can avoid prison 
by maintaining a clean record during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanazawa was accused of slapping and kicking a 57-year-old executive during 
questioning Oct. 14 about bribes paid by construction executives to local 
politicians.

ELECTIONS / MEASURE Z; BOOSTERS PUSH PORT HUENEME TAX FOR POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, Tuesday's ballot features races for everything from governor 
to county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a small-town issue -- whether to tax homeowners $56 a year to 
maintain the city's police force -- that is commanding most of the attention, 
judging by the forest of campaign signs on front lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of losing the city's 19-member police force has galvanized 
residents, who see it as a hallmark of the community's independence. The city 
cut two positions from the department last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of volunteers who have mobilized over the past few weeks are spending 
the remaining days before the election posting signs, knocking on doors, and 
hawking mugs, T-shirts and bumper stickers to help spare the local police. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, Measure Z supporters will gather at the Hueneme High School 
athletic field for Port Hueneme Country Days, daylong fund-raisers featuring 
craft and food booths, entertainment and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has absolutely brought us together," said Valorie Morrison, chairwoman of 
the Save Our Port Hueneme Police Department committee. "We have a little 
paradise here, and we want to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the menu of the snack bar Morrison runs at the Port Hueneme Pier, a 
handbill urges customers to vote "Yes on Measure Z." Nearby, a black T-shirt 
proclaiming support for the initiative hangs from a rafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for the measure seems to be pouring in from all parts of the seaside 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Hueneme Road, dozens of canary-yellow signs line the thoroughfare, 
asking voters to say yes to the tax increase. At Ventura Road and Channel 
Islands Boulevard, an imposing black billboard offers the same message. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having some trouble with the city because they have to stay neutral and 
we can't post (the signs) in the medians," said Jay Skidmore, a volunteer who 
was out pitching signs along Hueneme Road on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my way, I'd wrap 'em around every tree," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone in the city of 22,000 is willing to plunk down slightly more 
than $1 a week to spare the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I vote no on everything from Port Hueneme," John Ferraro, a retired phone 
company worker, said while fishing from the pier Wednesday. "I don't see 
anything wrong with contracting out for police." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more so than any issue since the controversial "view tax," Measure Z 
is stirring up debate in bars and diners, and biting into discussions among 
friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro, for one, said he started distrusting city officials when they imposed 
a $200-a-year tax on the ocean view from his beachfront condominium. "Now they 
want to put an RV park in there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skidmore, wearing one of the $10 T-shirts he sells, said people recognize the 
logo. They reach into their pockets for donations, no questions asked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got four quarters from one person who was just coming out of the store," he 
said. "Another guy dug into his pocket and gave me $2. It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax would generate about $500,000 a year in additional income -- roughly 
the difference between current revenues and the $2.2 million it costs to run 
the Police Department, according to City Manager Richard Velthoen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police service is the major general fund expense," said Velthoen, who 
administers the city's $6.8-million budget. "It's huge. When you manage a small 
department, it's more difficult to spread costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 7,000 or so homeowners would pay $56 a year, while commercial and 
industrial buildings would be taxed 2 1/2 cents per square foot. Vacant lots 
would be charged just under a penny per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure requires approval by a two-thirds majority to pass. But Velthoen 
said that if it comes close but fails, he might recommend that the City Council 
impose a utility users tax to make up the $500,000 difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen said the city has 77 employees, about a dozen fewer than it did 20 
years ago. Also, Port Hueneme police typically make less than their 
counterparts elsewhere in Ventura County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police officers here know everybody," said Ginger Viveros, a Hueneme Road 
resident who planted a "Yes on Measure Z" sign in her front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know who the good guys are and they know who the bad guys are," Viveros 
said. "They saw a van one time that was unfamiliar to them, and the guy turned 
out to be selling stolen TVs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just knew that something wasn't right and they caught the guy."

PANEL APPROVES FURTHER STUDY OF POINT MUGU AIRFIELD; AVIATION: INITIAL FINDINGS 
ARE FAVORABLE FOR COMMERCIAL USE. TWO MEMBERS ARE OPPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite vehement opposition from two members, a committee of public officials 
Wednesday authorized further study of a proposal to bring commercial air 
service to the Navy's air strip at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Point Mugu Airfield Investigative Committee voted 4 to 2 to accept the 
initial findings of a feasibility study that a Point Mugu airport would attract 
civilian passengers from as far away as Santa Barbara and Burbank, but that the 
airport would get little air freight traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the upbeat conclusion, the committee agreed to move forward on the 
second phase of a study on the feasibility of a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk and Camarillo City Councilwoman 
Charlotte Craven sharply objected to the committee considering the airport 
"feasible" until aviation planners can explain who would pay for such an 
airport and assure that it would not harm habitat in nearby wetlands, increase 
smog in the county and cut into farmland designated as greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implications of what we are doing here are astonishingly huge," 
VanderKolk said. "I believe that if we go forward with (the project), it will 
be the death knell for our way of life in this county. The thought of moving 
forward with this scares the heck out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Both women said the committee should have withheld its endorsement of the 
findings of the study, conducted by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, until environmental and financial issues are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members include VanderKolk and Craven, Supervisors John K. Flynn and 
Maggie Kildee, Thousand Oaks City Councilman Frank Schillo, Oxnard Councilman 
Michael Plisky and Port Hueneme Mayor Orvene Carpenter. The committee is 
chaired by Navy Capt. Tom Boothe. Kildee was absent from the meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven accused some committee members of pushing the project along despite 
insufficient answers to the most serious environmental and financial questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consultants just blithely went over several areas where, in my opinion, 
we still do not have adequate answers," she said. "We are being pushed on this, 
and I don't think it's right." 
</P>
<P>
 The SCAG study, released late last week, concluded that commercial airlines 
would lure between 1.6 million and 2.5 million passengers a year to Point Mugu 
by 2010. The study projected that the total cost of building a civilian air 
terminal next to the Navy's runway could run as high as $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the study found that the region's pool of 1.7 million passengers 
would readily use such a facility, the prospects of a thriving air cargo 
business were not as good. Most area growers expressed interest in shipping by 
air, but said they feared higher costs and logistic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Ventura County's fresh-cut flower growers, who serve East Coast domestic 
markets, said they would immediately take advantage of air cargo service if 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 But Plisky said the results of the study's first phase were enough to make him 
confident that the project will work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are there any fatal flaws here? It seems that the answer is no," Plisky said. 
"I think we should move on with this thing and get Phase II of the study under 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn also heartily endorsed the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can combine this with Metrolink and our bus system, we'll have a total 
transportation package for the county," Flynn said. "I don't see any problems 
that can't be worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the committee's decision Wednesday, Craven said she will ask the 
committee at its June 15 meeting to authorize a 30-day public study period of 
the SCAG report and to invite comment from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very important that people see there are some serious concerns 
about this project that will impact the whole county -- not just eastern 
Camarillo," Craven said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Merwin, SCAG's chief aviation analyst and author of the Point Mugu study, 
said Phase II of the report will cost about $80,000. SCAG will pick up the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The second report, which should be ready by October, will study the proposal's 
economic benefits, land planning and environmental impact, the interest of 
commercial airlines and other issues. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Point Mugu Airfield Investigative Committee will next meet at 11 a.m. June 
15 at the offices of the county Department of Airports at Camarillo Airport, 
295 Durley Ave. The public is invited to attend.

REVIEW OF PROPOSED RV RESORT RECOMMENDED; DEVELOPMENT: COASTAL COMMISSION STAFF 
MEMBERS SAY APPEAL FILED BY OPPONENTS OF THE PLANNED OCEANFRONT PROJECT HAS 
MERIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmental concerns over a proposed oceanfront recreational resort in Port 
Hueneme should trigger a full-scale review of the project by the California 
Coastal Commission, the agency's staff members are recommending. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal Commission staffers said Wednesday that an appeal filed by opponents 
of the recreational vehicle park has merit and warrants further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission is scheduled to consider the matter Wednesday. If 
commissioners agree with staff, a comprehensive review of the proposal will be 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are recommending that we go back and do our own independent analysis of 
the project," said Christopher Price, a Ventura-based program analyst with the 
state agency. "I think the city would like to have it over with as soon as 
possible, but we need to be thorough." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of planning and public meetings, the Port Hueneme City Council 
last month approved the 144-space RV resort on 10 acres at the end of Ocean 
View Drive at Port Hueneme Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the project will generate hundreds of thousands of dollars 
a year in profit, revenue badly needed to maintain the seaside park and fund 
other city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has pledged that the money generated from the RV resort will be used 
to maintain those facilities," City Manager Richard Velthoen said of the 
beachfront park. "It is a fact that without additional sources of revenue for 
those purposes, those facilities will without question deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the proposed RV park fear that it will harm nearby wetlands 
and ruin their ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 In appealing the City Council's approval of the project to the Coastal 
Commission, detractors argued that the resort would violate city and state laws 
guiding coastal development. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, opponents say the Hueneme Beach Park Master Plan only allows for 
the site to be developed with picnic tables, a playground and other minor 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission staff members agree that those concerns deserve further 
examination. Residents who have fought the project said they expect the 
commission to adopt the staff's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I would look at this as any kind of victory," said Dorothy 
Blake, one of several homeowners who appealed the project's approval. "I look 
at it as just the start of the process. We still have a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and nearby property owners have vowed to file a federal 
lawsuit against the city if the Coastal Commission approves the project. 
</P>
<P>
 But that approval may be tough to get. Commission staff members say they have 
concerns in addition to those raised by the opponents, including its effect on 
coastal habitat and other biological resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of issues outside the scope of those being raised in the 
appeal," Price said. "Basically, we want to override the local government's 
decision-making process and take it upon ourselves to look further into those 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen noted that an environmental impact report prepared for the project 
said it would do little harm to surrounding habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you build something, there is an impact on the environment," he 
said. "The question is how much of an impact is there? Our research, which has 
gone back five years, indicates that the impact will be minimal."

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL UPS MINORITY ENROLLMENT; VENTURA: MOUND ADMINISTRATORS' 
ACTION FOLLOWS LAST YEAR'S FEDERAL INQUIRY. THE MAGNET FACILITY WILL STILL BE 
OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under pressure from federal civil rights investigators, Mound School in 
Ventura has boosted the number of minority students from 11% of total 
enrollment this year to 17% for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnet school will still be overwhelmingly white compared to the Ventura 
Unified School District as a whole, which has a 36% minority enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials said they are pleased that they are making progress at 
gradually diversifying the student body at Mound. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office for Civil Rights of the U. S. Department of Education investigated 
enrollment practices at Mound last year following a complaint that the school 
was less accessible to minority students than whites. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry ended with school officials agreeing to take steps to enroll more 
minority children at the kindergarten- through fifth-grade school. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the first time this year, the district ran ads in English- and 
Spanish-language newspapers and radio stations encouraging families to apply to 
enroll their children at Mound. 
</P>
<P>
 Then school officials gave preference to minority students in the lottery that 
is held each spring to fill spaces for the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 252 children whose names were put into the lottery to fill 66 spaces 
for the next school year, about 20% were minorities, which is a higher 
percentage than in the past, Administrative Services Director Arlene Miro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity about the federal investigation may have spurred more minority 
families to apply for the available spots, Miro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such an awareness now throughout the district and throughout the town 
that there was a problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And by giving special preference to minority applicants, district officials 
filled nearly three-quarters of the available spaces with nonwhite students. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new students are in the school's incoming kindergarten class. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lottery, school officials randomly picked names of families who had 
applied to enroll one or more of their children and assigned a ranking to each 
name for the grade level of those students. The first name picked for fifth 
grade, for example, would be ranked first to get any available spots at that 
grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the first students chosen for each grade would have been chosen 
for any open spots. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, officials scanned the list of students to see how many of the 
high-ranking students in each grade were minorities. If most of the students in 
the top slots were white, officials replaced the lowest-ranking names of white 
students with the highest-ranking minority applicants for that grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 Miro said the district is careful to give preference to the minority 
applicants with the highest lottery ranking to keep the element of randomness. 
"It is by chance," she said. "The lottery is still done." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the lottery was done last month, Miro said about 55 parents have called 
to complain about their children not being selected, which is about the same 
number of calls the district received last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two irate parents charged that the district was engaging in reverse 
discrimination, Miro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the percentage of minorities at Mound is still far lower than the 
districtwide total, school officials said they are confident that the numbers 
will gradually increase as the new minority students' brothers and sisters join 
them at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura district gives siblings of students at any school preference on 
enrollment at that school. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal education officials also said they are satisfied with the progress 
that the district is making in integrating Mound. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing what they said they were going to do," Department of Education 
spokesman Roger Moore said. "They're complying as agreed." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason that Mound School has had problems attracting minority students is 
it is in a mostly white neighborhood on the city's east side. And because it is 
a magnet school, parents have to provide their children's transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials said that more minority families have moved to the east 
side in recent years, and that many of the new minority students who will 
attend Mound next year live near the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Latinos make up the largest minority in Ventura, accounting for 
16% of the city's population, and a high proportion of Latino families live 
along Ventura Avenue on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 For these families, there is little incentive to send their children to Mound, 
said Vincent Ruiz, a former Ventura school board member. One of Mound's selling 
points is that it is the only year-round school on the city's east side, but 
several schools on the west side also have non-traditional calendars. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Avenue, they have their own year-round," Ruiz said. "They have very 
good programs over there. Most people, it doesn't have to be Hispanics, would 
rather have their children in the closest school."

ELECTIONS / JUDICIAL SEAT; DEBATE AVOIDS CONFRONTATION BY 2 CANDIDATES

<P>
 A much-anticipated meeting Wednesday night between the two candidates seeking 
Ventura County's only contested judgeship produced tough talk on dealing with 
repeat criminals but little confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White and defense lawyer James Matthew 
Farley touted their extensive, although varied, legal experiences and explained 
how their accomplishments would serve them well on the Superior Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of the event was cordial, with neither candidate revealing any 
information on their judicial positions that they had not previously discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's forum at the Oxnard Main Library, sponsored by the League of Women 
Voters of Ventura County, evolved after campaign workers from both sides sought 
to organize a debate between White and Farley before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 League President Dorothy Engel said the candidates agreed beforehand that it 
would be better not to conduct a head-on debate in order to reduce any 
friction. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions came first from the League of Women Voters, then members of the 
audience of more than 100 people -- mostly local lawyers and campaign 
supporters -- were allowed to question the candidates through a moderator. 
</P>
<P>
 From the onset, Farley harped on the issue that he has touted throughout the 
campaign: experience. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial lawyer for 27 years, Farley pointed out that his opponent has been an 
administrator for most of her career in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not an office lawyer because my time has been spent in court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the campaign has been grueling since Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. 
Hardy likened her to Mother Teresa after she announced her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started off this race as Mother Teresa," White said in her opening remarks. 
"I think I would be lucky if I finish as Leona Helmsley." 
</P>
<P>
 White also said she has extensive supervisorial responsibilities as the 
second-in-command to Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that she was married with three children by age 21, White remarked that 
she is not a lawyer who grew up "with a silver spoon in my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 The comment seemed to ruffle Farley, who said he left his family in New York 
to come to California in search of an education and career. "I wasn't born with 
a silver spoon in my mouth, either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At every opportunity, Farley criticized White's relative lack of courtroom 
exposure. "It's a trial court. It's not a committee room," he said at one 
point. "It's not a place where you get off the bench and consult with people." 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, Farley drew laughs when asked about describing himself in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like writing your own epitaph," he told the moderator. " 'How would 
you like to be described after death?' I haven't thought about it because I'm 
not ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 White didn't allow her opponent to monopolize the quips, however. Asked 
whether she is comfortable working in solitude, White joked: "I hope that this 
is not solitary confinement." 
</P>
<P>
 On a more serious note, each candidate said California needs some form of the 
three-strikes legislation that requires tough sentences for habitual criminal 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 White said that by demanding such a law, the public is sending a message to 
lawmakers that "the criminal justice system has failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said the present version of the three-strikes law -- which does not 
distinguish between violent and nonviolent offenders on the third felony crime 
-- is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 The one area of disagreement for the defense attorney and the prosecutor was 
how to treat juvenile delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said the county should be salvaging more of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see the youth, even the gang youth, being totally unredeemable," he 
said, adding, "We should have more than just lock-up for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 But White said some juveniles are treated too lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would support tougher penalties for juveniles, especially in serious 
situations such as drive-by shootings," she said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: BELL CANYON; DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER HIGH-SPEED CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A suspected drunk driver was arrested after he led Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies on a chase from Bell Canyon to Canoga Park that ended after he crashed 
his luxury sports car, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Roberts, 43, of Salt Lake City was being held on $35,000 bail at the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys Division Jail on Wednesday.Roberts was 
arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and evading arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase started about 11:45 p.m. Tuesday when Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies passing through Los Angeles County noticed that a car had run a red 
light, Senior Deputy Hallett Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said he and Deputy William Gentry tried to stop the speeding Jaguar 
because they thought that it might be stolen. One of the car's windows was 
broken, which is a common way for thieves to enter a car, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver refused to pull over and led deputies on a 10-mile chase on surface 
streets in Canoga Park, with speeds reaching 80 m.p.h., Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those things have some power to them," said Sullivan, who was chasing the 
Jaguar in a department-issued Ford Crown Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase ended when the Jaguar ran another red light and hit a car at high 
speed at Saticoy Street and Topanga Canyon Boulevard, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the other car, Madeleine Hovspian, 22, of Tarzana, received 
minor injuries. Roberts' car spun out of control and came to rest at the curb, 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Van Nuys Municipal Court. PEGGY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; $10-MILLION ROAD PROJECT APPROVED 
</P>

<P>
 One of Ventura County's most dangerous stretches of highway will be widened 
and a two-lane bridge near Fillmore replaced under a $10-million project 
approved Wednesday by the California Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The state will begin work in December on the five-mile segment of California 
126, running from the east Fillmore grade crossing to just east of Powell 
Road.In addition, the state Department of Transportation will replace an aging 
bridge with a two-span concrete bridge, built to the latest seismic safety 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrow, two-lane road has been the scene of numerous head-on accidents -- 
most recently on Wednesday -- as motorists try to pass other cars or simply 
drift across the median strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The road-widening project, under way for seven years, will eventually create a 
continuous, four-lane highway from the Ventura Freeway to the Golden State 
Freeway near Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been concerned that because of the earthquake, this would be put off, 
but Caltrans found the money," Fillmore City Councilman Roger Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the latest stretch is completed in June, 1996, only seven miles of 
two-lane road will remain, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the accident Wednesday, on a stretch of California 126 just west of the Los 
Angeles County line, a Santa Maria truck driver was critically injured when he 
was struck by a pickup truck as he stood outside his disabled rig, police and 
family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup, driven by Hassan Mechamal, 21, of Fillmore, veered across the 
narrow stretch of California 126 about 1 p.m. and pinned Larry Cosand, 26, to 
his tractor-trailer, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosand underwent surgery late Wednesday at Santa Paula Memorial Hospital, said 
his father, Floyd D. Cosand of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation of the accident was continuing, authorities said. PHYLLIS W.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; BICYCLIST DIES 2 WEEKS AFTER BEING HIT 
BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 26-year-old Port Hueneme man who was struck by a car while bicycling more 
than two weeks ago died Wednesday morning from his injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Tupper died at 5:55 a.m. Wednesday at St. John's Pleasant Valley 
Hospital in Camarillo, where he had lingered in the intensive-care unit since 
his accident May 17, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Lane, 54, of Newbury Park was cited for being at fault in the accident, 
but CHP Officer Dave Wigton, who investigated the accident, did not request 
prosecution at the time, authorities said. On Wednesday, authorities said they 
were uncertain whether the death would change Wigton's decision not to seek 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Wigton could not be reached for comment, but he said in an earlier interview 
that the accident was difficult to investigate because no independent witnesses 
were available. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his accident, Tupper was cycling on Potrero Road in Newbury 
Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Lane was trying to pass another vehicle as she rounded a curve near Lewis 
Road, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane crossed over the double yellow line and hit Tupper, who was cycling in 
the opposite direction, CHP officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Tupper was wearing a helmet, he suffered head, abdominal and knee 
injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tupper worked as a researcher at Amgen, a Newbury Park-based biotechnology 
firm.  
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his parents, who live in San Jose, hospital officials said.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; WORKER HEALTH STUDY IS FOCUS OF MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An advisory panel overseeing a worker health study at Rockwell International's 
Santa Susana Field Laboratory -- once the site of extensive nuclear testing -- 
will hold public meetings today and Friday on the progress of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the $840,000 worker health study, which was commissioned last 
year by the U. S. Department of Energy, is to determine if there have been 
unusually high incidents of cancer and other illnesses among workers over the 
years due to chemical and radiological exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Rockwell has been engaged in an ongoing cleanup operation of 
mostly low-level chemical and radioactive contamination at the lab from more 
than 30 years of nuclear research. The lab ceased all of its nuclear operations 
in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell officials have maintained for years that there has never been a 
significant release of contaminants at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory panel, which consists of community representatives and 
scientists, will hold two meetings today on the study's progress at the Clarion 
Hotel, 1775 Madera Road, Simi Valley, a spokesman with the California 
Department of Health Services said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first portion of the meeting will run from 1 to 5 p.m., and the evening 
portion will run from 7 to 9 p.m. Dr. Alice Stewart, a member of the advisory 
panel and a world-renowned authority on the effects of low-level radiation, is 
scheduled to speak at tonight's session. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the advisory panel will hold a final public meeting at the hotel 
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. CARLOS V. LOZANO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; DEBRIS BASINS TO COLLECT EXCESS WATER 
AND MUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven months after a fire blackened thousands of acres near Santa Paula, a 
team of contractors has completed two drainage projects that officials hope 
will safeguard the community from heavy rains and flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 At an afternoon ceremony Wednesday in Adams Canyon, Santa Paula Mayor Wayne 
Johnson joined other dignitaries to mark the opening of two new debris basins. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it takes three years for the earth to heal itself (after a fire)," 
Johnson told the sparse crowd of workers and officials. "Well, this project and 
its sister project will protect us until then." 
</P>
<P>
 The Adams Canyon basin was built just north of Foothill Road, east of Briggs 
Road. A second facility was constructed simultaneously at Fagan Canyon, just to 
the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the $2-million basins will collect any excess rain or mudflows 
that may result from the fire-denuded hillsides and damaged watershed, which 
take years to regenerate enough to effectively soak up rainwater. 
</P>
<P>
 The basins are designed to protect at least 500 homes and businesses in the 
event of a 10-year flood, Ventura County Public Works Director Arthur Goulet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten through the first winter and we were very fortunate we didn't 
have any heavy rains," Goulet said. "But we've got four more years to worry 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Goulet said the last time that Ventura County experienced a 10-year flood was 
in 1992. "But you can never say," he said. "The way the odds work, it's really 
a 10% chance every year." 
</P>
<P>
 The basins are designed to gather runoff water and the twigs, branches and mud 
that tumble with it down the mountainside into Adams Barranca and Fagan Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 They will far outlive the immediate threat, Goulet and other officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will function in perpetuity and we will continue to maintain it," Goulet 
said. "When it gets beyond 25% full, we will clean it out and dispose of the 
materials properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he had been most concerned about the Santa Paula West mobile-home 
park, where hundreds of people live nestled against the foothills along 
Beckwith Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of homes in there, and it's been very close (to flooding)," he 
said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAN GETS 11 YEARS IN FATAL CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man who had at least seven previous drunk-driving convictions was sentenced 
Wednesday to the maximum term of nearly 11 years for vehicular manslaughter in 
connection with the death of a 54-year-old Simi Valley man. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath handed down the 
sentence to Michael Rodriguez, 39, who struck and killed Raphael Lachmiller as 
Lachmiller walked to his family's house on Whitcomb Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty aggravated case as far as his past record goes," said 
Rodriguez's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Bryant Fitzpatrick. "He was kind 
of expecting the worse. I had pretty much prepped him that things could happen 
as they did." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge sentenced Rodriguez to the maximum term of 10 years and eight 
months, as five members of the victim's family, including his wife and brother, 
had asked. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath cited Rodriguez's prior drunk-driving convictions and the 
circumstances of Lachmiller's death, Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred April 15, after Rodriguez first hit several parked cars 
and slammed into Lachmiller as he was trying to flee, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 At his arraignment two weeks later, Rodriguez entered an early guilty plea to 
spare the victim's family from having to relive Lachmiller's death through a 
trial, Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez last year was convicted of hit-and-run and driving under the 
influence in two separate cases, prosecutors said. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EX-CRIME LAB CHIEF ENTERS INNOCENT PLEA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Sheriff's Department supervisor pleaded not guilty Wednesday to 
stealing a firearm from the property room and selling it at an Oxnard pawnshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Municipal Judge Arturo F. Gutierrez scheduled a June 27 
preliminary hearing for Norman A. Wade, who faces a single count of grand 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade headed the Sheriff's Department's crime lab but was fired after pleading 
no contest to stealing a license-plate registration sticker from the property 
room and falsifying registration documents from his car, sheriff's officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On that count, Wade, 49, was found guilty, fined $300 and sentenced to two 
years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 He now works in Phoenix as a toxicologist for the Maricopa County medical 
examiner. He appeared in court Wednesday with his attorney, Robert Schwartz, 
who disputes the claim that Wade was fired from his Ventura County job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not fired," Schwartz said. "He resigned." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Chief Deputy Kenneth Kipp acknowledged that "we may have negotiated 
a resignation" for Wade. But the bottom line, Kipp said, is that Wade did not 
leave the department voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 In his current criminal case, Wade is accused of taking a .357-magnum pistol 
out of the gun locker at the crime lab in Ventura and pawning it at Get-Mor 
Loan & Jewelry in Oxnard for $125 in May, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The handgun had been logged into the gun locker in the sheriff's property room 
after prosecutors in a 1983 court case determined that they no longer needed 
it, officials said. DWAYNE BRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Capitalizing on a growing interest in child development courses, Cal State 
Northridge's Ventura Campus has increased its annual course offerings and is 
holding an orientation at 7:30 tonight to draw new students. 
</P>
<P>
 Academic advisers will explain the course work and goals of the two-year 
bachelor's degree program, which forms a base for preschool teachers and for 
pursuing further education degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "That particular degree program seems to attract people who go to school 
full-time, so we are stepping up (the course offerings) on our side," said 
Janis Wilde, the campus academic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The child development program brings in about 35 new students each semester, 
so many that the satellite campus decided to offer certain courses every year, 
rather than every two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates have used child development training in medical and therapy fields, 
but many go on to become elementary or special education teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, advisers will discuss programs in psychology and English on 
Monday, sociology on Tuesday and business administration on Wednesday. The 
meetings will take place at 5:30 p.m. at the Ventura Campus, 2151 Alessandro 
Drive. 
</P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LANDFILL PROPONENTS MEET SIGNATURE GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of a ballot initiative that would allow a landfill to be built in 
Weldon Canyon said they have gathered more than enough signatures to help 
qualify the measure for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic Resources, the San Diego County firm seeking the ballot initiative, 
has until Monday to obtain 18,753 valid signatures from Ventura County voters 
to place the measure on the November ballot. As of Wednesday, the firm had 
collected 21,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers and paid signature-gatherers plan to collect another 4,000 to 9,000 
signatures before the deadline to make sure that Taconic has enough valid 
signatures of registered voters to meet the minimum requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're setting the record for the most signatures collected in the 
shortest amount of time," said Richard Chase, general manager of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery, a supporter of the measure, said 
the swift success of the signature drive was not unexpected. "I think it's an 
indication of how widely supported this is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the signatures have been from voters in the eastern part of Ventura 
County and Oxnard, said Montgomery and Eloise Brown, former mayor of Moorpark 
and an initiative supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said residents in Oxnard and Simi Valley hope that a landfill in Weldon 
Canyon, which is about 2 1/2 miles north of Ventura and five miles south of 
Ojai, will take trash that is now disposed of in their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very definite concern that when Bailard (Landfill in Oxnard) 
closes in 1997, if there isn't something else planned, we're going to have a 
real problem," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents in Ojai and Ventura fear that a Weldon Canyon landfill, which 
would be built on 551 acres within the 6,474-acre site, would worsen air 
quality and could pose health risks from valley fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Ojai City Council authorized the city attorney to prepare a 
pre-election challenge to the measure if supporters obtain enough valid

DISABLED PLANE LANDS SAFELY NEAR CAMARILLO

 Three Los Angeles-area men walked away unharmed from an emergency landing 
Wednesday night after their single-engine aircraft lost power and came down in 
a freshly tilled field north of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially we thought about getting back to Camarillo (Airport), but it was 
getting risky, so we just picked this field," said George Gonzalez, a passenger 
in the rented Mooney 201 plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez and John Casanova of Los Angeles had flown to Oxnard earlier 
Wednesday with Van Nuys flight instructor Karl Florine. They were on their way 
back to Van Nuys about 7 p.m. when the engine suddenly cut off, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than risk a crash, they made an emergency landing in a field at San 
Miguel Farms, off Los Angeles Avenue between Mesa School and the Somis Nut 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, the landing gear lay scattered across the field, torn off 
when the plane touched down. The plane's left wing and nose were clearly 
damaged, but the fuselage was largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
 For the three men, the biggest problem seemed to be finding a telephone and a 
way back to Van Nuys. About 8:15 p.m., they piled into a Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department car to use the phone at the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 An official at Flight Works, which owns the rented plane, declined comment on 
the possible loss from the accident. Federal Aviation Administration officials 
were expected to begin investigating the emergency landing today, Sheriff's 
Deputy Marco Paschia said. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

CONCERNS OVER SOIL DELAY HEARING; NEWBURY PARK: THE JANUARY QUAKE PROMPTS SOME 
THOUSAND OAKS OFFICIALS TO QUESTION THE STABILITY OF SITE PROPOSED FOR HOUSING 
PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Concerns that land slated for a major Newbury Park development may be unstable 
have prompted Thousand Oaks city planners to delay hearings on the 89-house 
project, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has asked Raznick & Sons Inc., a Woodland Hills company that has long 
tried to build on 44 acres near Reino and Lynn roads, to conduct a study of the 
soil for evidence of liquefaction, said Bob Rickards, a senior city planner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake spurred concerns from some city officials about the 
stability of the land. Newbury Park residents opposed to the project have been 
pushing since fall to require such a study. 
</P>
<P>
 If the soil is found to be unstable, the land would not be safe for 
construction without additional grading and special foundations for housing 
built on the site, Senior City Planner Greg Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The setback comes in the wake of several delays for the developer, primarily 
resulting from public opposition to the project and the existence of a wetland 
on a portion of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Raznick was scheduled to present a scaled-back plan to the Planning Commission 
when the city requested the soil study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not kicking and screaming about it," said Ellen Michiel, assistant vice 
president of Raznick & Sons. "We believed that the studies we had already done 
were adequate, but a new study will put us in the position of having the most 
up-to-date information." 
</P>
<P>
 But gathering that information will mean added costs and delays for the 
project, Michiel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question this is going to be a major expense for us, especially 
given what has gone into this project already," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company initially intended to begin construction on the property in 1990, 
three years after purchasing the land from developer Nedjatollah Cohan. But the 
project was stalled by state and federal regulators concerned about the impact 
of 98 residences on the nearby wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 Raznick then faced the opposition of local residents, who argued that the 
project was too dense for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the City Council narrowly rejected the project because of its 
density and its potential threat to the wetland. At that public hearing, 
residents raised the new issue of liquefaction, bringing along an expert to 
explain the potential threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard the concerns of the public at that meeting, and we've decided that 
before we proceed, we should take the extra steps necessary to make certain 
there's not a problem," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the public outcry, Rickards said the quake rekindled the city's 
concerns about liquefaction on the property and spurred the new study. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a study prepared before the quake, but we felt it would be a good 
idea to revisit the issue in case anything has changed as a result of all the 
ground movement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said a similar study will also be required of Cohan, who has 
been trying for 12 years to develop the 45-acre parcel directly adjacent to the 
Raznick property. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohan's son, Albert Cohen, said Wednesday that he had not been told about the 
additional study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We no longer have any clue what that city wants from us," Cohen said. "Every 
day, it's something new." 
</P>
<P>
 Rickards said public demand and safety concerns require the city to ask for 
the study, despite the additional burden it places on the developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having their projects come back to the city again and again is very tough for 
them," Rickards said. "Every time the projects come back, everyone has another 
chance to take a shot at them."

NEIGHBOR TESTIFIES SHE SAW RUSSO BEAT HER DAUGHTER WITH SHOE; COURTS: TESTIMONY 
CONTRADICTS DEFENDANT'S STATEMENTS THAT SHE DID NOT USE ANY OBJECTS TO STRIKE 
GIRL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Thousand Oaks woman testified Wednesday that she was standing on her 
Westlake balcony several years ago when she witnessed Charlotte Russo pounding 
her teen-aged daughter in the head with a gym shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, seated on the edge of a barbecue pit, did not resist or defend 
herself as her screaming mother pummeled her 10 times or more with the shoe, 
and kicked her and punched her, neighbor Erica Paymard testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while, I just yelled for her to stop, that 'You're going to kill her! 
Stop!' " said Paymard, the last major witness in Russo's six-week child-abuse 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Paymard testified that Russo turned around, looked at her and took her 
daughter into the house, where Paymard said the mother's tirade continued to be 
audible. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors consider Paymard's testimony significant because it contradicts 
many of Russo's statements on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 During several days of testimony, Russo admitted to once biting the girl in 
self-defense and occasionally slapping her. The mother steadfastly denied, 
however, using any objects to strike her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo also testified that the only times she hit her daughter were when the 
girl, now 16, "mouthed off" or "sassed" her. Still, Russo said that even on 
those occasions, she never did more than slap the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paymard's account of that day in early March, 1991, contrasted sharply 
with Russo's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo is charged with felony child abuse for reportedly biting the girl, and 
misdemeanor child abuse for reportedly forcing the girl to sleep in a back-yard 
racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
 The beating described in court Wednesday lasted 10 minutes, Paymard told the 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "For that entire 10 minutes, was Mrs. Russo hitting (her daughter)?" Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Dee Corona asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time, yes," Paymard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How was she hitting her?" Corona asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was hitting her about the head and on top of the head." 
</P>
<P>
 "How many times did she hit (her) with the sneaker?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't count, but it could be 10 times." 
</P>
<P>
 The Paymards moved into the house directly behind the Russo's nine-bedroom 
home on Outlook Circle in June, 1990. Paymard said she has never met Russo or 
her daughter. But, she said, she has a teen-aged daughter who was a friend of 
the Russo girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Paymard, who said she had been reluctant to testify and get involved with the 
prosecution against Russo, testified that she had seen Russo's daughter several 
times pedaling her bicycle the 6 1/2 miles to La Reina High School in the 
summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
 She wanted to give the girl a ride because the bike ride seemed torturous, but 
did not think that it would be appropriate, Paymard testified. Russo has 
acknowledged forcing her daughter to bike the 13-mile round trip between their 
home and summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 The day of the shoe beating, Paymard said she at first just watched as the 
girl was grabbed and slapped by her mother. She said Russo was extremely 
agitated and yelling. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the gym shoe from the girl, Russo began attacking her daughter 
with it, Paymard told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Paymard said Russo's husband, Richard, was also in the back yard, but did not 
strike the girl or intervene. Richard Russo, a stockbroker, pleaded guilty to 
misdemeanor child abuse and has served a 30-day jail term. He is on three years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under intense cross-examination, Paymard conceded that she was contacted by 
investigators only after her 17-year-old daughter applied for a volunteer 
position on the staff of Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White. 
</P>
<P>
 Russo's attorney -- James M. Farley, who is White's opponent in the Tuesday 
election for a county judgeship -- suggested that Paymard's testimony was 
designed to help her daughter in her hunt for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 After Paymard said her daughter was with her when she saw the Russo girl 
riding her bike to summer school, Farley asked, "That's the same daughter who 
applied for a job with the district attorney's office, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paymard denied that her testimony was influenced by the job hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 She also acknowledged under cross examination that she is nearsighted and did 
not have on her glasses the day that she said she saw Russo beat her daughter 
with the shoe. She said that was a reason she never spoke up to authorities 
about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw this, I didn't have my glasses on," she testified. "And because I 
didn't have my glasses on, (authorities) would question, 'What did you really 
see?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Paymard paused briefly and declared, "But I know what I saw."

ATTORNEY ACCUSES AUCTION HOUSE OF FRAUD; TRAIL: LAWYER SAYS SUPERIOR STAMP & 
COIN CO. ORCHESTRATED 'AN UNPARALLELED SCHEME' TO SWINDLE HIS CLIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A coin auction house co-owned by sports magnate Bruce McNall was accused 
Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior court of orchestrating a fraud scheme to take 
advantage of the daughters of a Thousand Oaks millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert A. Levinson, an attorney representing the sisters suing the Superior 
Stamp & Coin Co., told a judge during opening statements that evidence will 
show his clients fell victim to an "unparalleled scheme of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 The embattled McNall, who is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, owns 51% 
of Superior. Last week he entered into bankruptcy proceedings and recently sold 
72% of the Los Angeles Kings franchise to pay off a business loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Trompeter Gonzalez and her sister, Janet Trompeter Polachek, sued 
Superior in 1992 over its handling of their father Emanuel "Ed" Trompeter's 
coin collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Before dying of inoperable cancer, Ed Trompeter, a Westlake Village 
electronics manufacturer, decided to sell his collection that included some of 
the rarest U.S. coins, fearing his daughters could fall prey to an unscrupulous 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Trompeter hired Superior to sell, in two auctions, nearly 400 coins he had 
gathered over 20 years. But a legal battle erupted after the first auction, 
which took in $3.5 million in gross proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters -- who are seeking $1.5 million in legal fees and damages -- 
allege that Superior breached its contract with their father by improperly 
keeping $350,000 in commissions from the first auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The women also accuse Superior of overcharging their father $100,000 for a set 
of coins he purchased in 1990, and for charging them about $1 million the 
company claimed Ed Trompeter owed at the time of his death in 1992, Levinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinson also accused Superior officials of stonewalling the sisters when they 
asked questions about the condition of the rare coin market prior to the second 
auction. The women subsequently hired experts who informed them the market had 
taken a substantial downturn, prompting them to file a court injunction to stop 
Superior from going forward with the second auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior filed a counterclaim seeking commissions it expected to earn from the 
second auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Revere, an attorney for Superior, began his opening statements Wednesday 
by denying any wrongdoing, fraud or deceit on the part of his clients in 
regards to Ed Trompeter's trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere said Trompeter had spent $18 million on his hobby of collecting rare 
coins and had extensive dealings over the years with Ira Goldberg, a Superior 
co-president named as a defendant in the lawsuit. He said Trompeter owed 
Superior $900,000 plus interest for a group of coins he purchased known as the 
Amazonian Set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was during a meeting in April, 1991, that Trompeter signed a promissory 
note left blank at the time because neither party was certain of how much 
interest had accrued on the debt, Revere alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 In a trial brief filed with the court, however, Levinson contended that 
Superior filled in the blank after Trompeter had died, and that he only owed 
the company about half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in dispute is the commission Superior received from the first auction. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Levinson, Superior agreed in the contract to keep only a 7.5% 
"seller's commission" from the sale. But Superior, he said, improperly 
collected another $350,000 in commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Trompeter Gonzalez, of Mexico, has possession of the rest of the coins 
from her father's collection, but remains uncertain as to what she plans to do 
with them, Levinson said. "She won't sell them through Superior that's for 
sure," Levinson.  
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez testified in court Wednesday before Superior Court Judge Daniel A. 
Curry -- who will decide the case because both parties waved their rights to a 
jury trial -- that her father started his electronics business at age 45 in the 
garage of the family's Canoga Park home. 
</P>
<P>
 As the business developed the company moved to a plant in Canoga Park, then 
Chatsworth and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinson said McNall, who was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, is 
expected to testify on behalf of the defense when they present their case 
probably sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Miller, an attorney representing Superior co-owner Goldberg and his 
brother Larry Goldberg, said his clients have entered into agreements to buy 
out McNall's 51% stock interest in the coin company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goldbergs alleged in a lawsuit settled this year that McNall used $4.6 
million from a bank credit line because he needed the money to maintain other 
ventures and his extraordinary lifestyle.

CONSULTANT QUITS CAMARILLO POST TO TAKE VENTURA JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One week after council members in Ventura and Camarillo cried foul, economic 
consultant Tom Flavin has resigned his position with the city of Camarillo to 
concentrate on recruiting businesses for Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Flavin, the former mayor of Burbank tapped last week for an economic 
consulting job in Ventura, said Wednesday that once he saw the terms of the 
Ventura contract this week, he realized that he could not work for both cities 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to know clearly what the scope of the work was in Ventura," he said. 
"I saw it did include business recruitment, which is what I was doing in 
Camarillo." 
</P>
<P>
 Flavin caused a flap among officials of both cities last week when he said he 
hoped that he could keep both jobs. The Camarillo contract, which Flavin signed 
in the fall, calls for him to work 25 hours a month at a monthly salary of 
$2,500. Flavin said his Ventura contract, which the City Council will vote on 
Monday night, would pay $6,000 a month for his full-time services. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo hired Flavin to recruit businesses to the city. The six-month 
Ventura contract calls on him to formulate a strategy for the city's economic 
revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura is still shopping for a permanent economic development coordinator to 
work on bringing new businesses in and keeping existing ones. Flavin, who will 
be considered for the permanent job, said he spent part of Wednesday talking to 
a company about relocating to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members from both cities said Flavin made the only decision he could 
in resigning from Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the honorable thing for him to do, in light of what's 
happened," Camarillo Councilwoman Charlotte Craven said. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose said he understood why Flavin picked Ventura over his 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got a chance for a full-time job," he said. "You can't blame him for 
that."  
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, council members said they would have the situation no other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the only way I would accept it," Councilman Jim Monahan said. "I 
think he's kind of left a bad taste in everybody's mouth, but as long as he's 
given up that (Camarillo) position, he did the right thing."

ELECTIONS / MEASURE A; CAMPAIGNS MISSING BUT VOTE MIGHT SET COURSE FOR OAK PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Henrietta and Leonard Katz had their pick of houses when they moved to Oak 
Park 27 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They were only the third family to settle in what was then a development of 
120 residences set against a backdrop of farmland and rolling hills. 
</P>
<P>
 They liked it then and they like it now. Of course, it is a little different 
now: A community of nearly 15,000 has grown up around their five-bedroom house. 
Where there once were 120 residences, there are now 4,650. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Oak Park now has a nationally acclaimed school system, its own 
shopping center, no more room to build -- and questions on how it will be 
governed in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, residents will vote on advisory ballot Measure A, which gives them 
a choice of annexing to Thousand Oaks, becoming a separate city or remaining an 
unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the decision could have widespread impact on the community's services 
-- including its much-disputed library, police and public transit systems -- 
there are no active campaigns to support any of the three options. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, Henrietta Katz said, is the general sense of satisfaction she and 
her family share with other residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if they're laid back here or disinterested," Katz said. "But I 
think most of them are just satisfied with things as they are, as I am. I've 
never been sorry we moved out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents' answers to what they like about living in Oak Park are nearly 
uniform: practically no crime, excellent schools, plentiful parks, neighbors 
who are friendly but don't invade much-desired privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park is in an odd position. Although it is part of Ventura County and 
governed by the Board of Supervisors, the community shares an area code with 
the San Fernando Valley and a ZIP code with Agoura Hills in Los Angeles County. 
Some residents say they have had battled with insurance agents who refuse to 
believe that they don't live in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, residents have developed a sense of identity that has little to 
do with either county and a just-leave-us-alone attitude. Whatever happens in 
Tuesday's vote, they say, the way of life in Oak Park will not -- and should 
not -- change. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city's staunchest supporter of incorporation, Ron Stark, has not so 
much as planted a sign in one of the community's trim green medians. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really wanted this election," said Stark, a longtime member of the Oak 
Park Municipal Advisory Council. "It was forced upon us." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who represents Oak Park, proposed the ballot 
measure. Stark and other members of the advisory panel have complained that 
spending $10,000 to put the measure on the ballot was wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark said the only action he has taken to campaign for incorporation was to 
co-author, with resident David Ross, the argument on the ballot in favor of 
forming a new city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said he feels strongly about the issue, but has not campaigned because 
the measure is only an advisory to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this were actually the vote to incorporate, I would have been campaigning 
quite vigorously," Ross said. "I just didn't see a need for it. The only 
campaigning has come out of VanderKolk's office." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she proposed the ballot measure because she thought that Oak 
Park residents were paying high taxes -- $16 million in the 1993-94 fiscal year 
-- and getting little in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line for me is that I have no vested interest in this," VanderKolk 
said. "I just don't think the people of Oak Park are being treated fairly. I 
was in the perfect position to give them a voice in what their future holds." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she is baffled by the community's resistance to the idea of 
annexing to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand it," she said. "They seem to think they will lose their 
community identity and that everything will go downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sad thing is that most people are not in favor of annexation," VanderKolk 
said. "It really boggles my mind why, because it seems very clear to me and to 
our consultants that Oak Park cannot incorporate without major additions to 
taxes. And to stay the way they are makes no sense because they're not 
receiving the services that they need and deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Behringer, a member of the Municipal Advisory Council, said only 180 
residents attended two community forums in May to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "That indicates to me that people have either already made up their mind and 
didn't want to bother, or that they don't care and aren't going to vote," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Gary Baum said he thought that Oak Park needed to improve services, 
but said he didn't agree with pro-annexation arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just trying to scare you into believing things are going to be better 
if we become part of Thousand Oaks," he said. "I'm going to vote to 
incorporate." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas status quo has become almost a dirty word in some political circles, 
in Oak Park, it is practically a mantra for many residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the status quo," said Leonard Katz, while his wife Henrietta nodded in 
agreement over the shelf of bestsellers at Oak Park's tiny library. "I don't 
want any annexation. I don't think it'll improve us." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomer Gudi Amerikaner agreed. She moved to Oak Park three months ago and 
said the attraction of clean air, friendly people and a low crime rate would 
keep her there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to be doing very nicely around here," she said. "I think we should 
leave it alone. If it isn't broke, don't fix it."

FIRST PENSION EXECS AGREE TO PLEAD GUILTY; INVESTIGATION: THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S 
OFFICE SAID THE PLEAS WILL BE ENTERED WHEN CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE FILED IN THE 
CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 William E. Cooper, founder of failed First Pension Corp., and his two partners 
have agreed to plead guilty to expected criminal charges stemming from a 
federal investigation into the disappearance of more than $100 million at the 
Irvine-based pension management firm, prosecutors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, along with Robert E. Lindley and Valerie Jensen, have signed 
agreements to cooperate with the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, while 
also agreeing to enter guilty pleas to as-yet-unspecified charges, said Leslie 
Swain, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to proceed with their cooperation and try to get this thing 
unwound," Swain said. "They won't be entering their guilty pleas until we file 
formal charges." 
</P>
<P>
 Swain would not specify when criminal charges will be filed but said the three 
will probably face fraud or related charges. Swain's remarks were confirmed by 
the defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen's attorney, Don Smaltz, said Jensen has been cooperating with federal 
authorities by providing documents and information since May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very decent person and got sucked into this. She was a watcher. . . 
. She was not the director or the leader," Smaltz said. "She didn't want to 
leave (First Pension), because she was afraid pensioners would lose 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 James Joseph, trustee for the First Pension bankruptcy, hailed the cooperation 
agreements as a sign that investors may finally get some answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's quite a significant development," Joseph said. "I would hope now that 
they will have to cooperate with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that First Pension's owners 
operated an elaborate pyramid scheme, leading clients to invest in mortgages 
that did not exist. As much as $124 million of the money invested by 8,000 
clients may have been lost to fraud and outright theft, investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy April 22, just as scores of 
investors who had accounts once valued at $350 million discovered that 
substantial sums were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, the three owners may help First Pension clients recoup 
some of their investments by surrendering their stakes in two other Orange 
County businesses that were said to be partially funded with investors' money, 
defense attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are now analyzing the best way to maximize the assets of the two 
companies, the defense attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Russell Hayman, attorney for Lindley, funds were diverted from 
First Pension's parent company, First Diversified Financial Services, to create 
Amerispec, an Orange-based company with more than 200 home inspection 
franchises and assets of $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was also used to create National Identification Systems in Irvine, 
which has a $3.2-million contract to make driver's licenses for the state of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The investments were intended to help First Diversified cover investors' 
losses in mortgage pools, Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, prosecutors "are looking at liquidating the assets, but selling 
the furniture and the computers may not provide much relief for investors. It 
might be better to give investors some kind of stake in the two companies." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorneys' office said it could not comment on the two companies or 
reveal whether further assets are available.

STUDIOS TALKED MERGER OF RIVAL 5TH NETWORKS; TELEVISION: CROSS-OWNERSHIP 
CONCERNS REPORTEDLY STYMIED DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN PARAMOUNT AND WARNER BROS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Paramount and Warner Bros. recently discussed merging their competing fifth 
television networks but were unable to come to terms, knowledgeable industry 
executives said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions, which were held by Paramount Pictures Chairman Jonathan 
Dolgen and Warner Bros. Executive Vice President Barry Meyer and other senior 
executives, were said to be complicated by cross-ownership concerns and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount executives were unavailable for comment. Jamie Kellner, president of 
Warner's WB network and an equity partner, said that "there are no ongoing 
discussions." Kellner said the talks never reached a "meaningful stage," 
adding, "In my opinion, the two entities will not be merged together." 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies have been in a race to sign up affiliates in recent months in 
the hopes of introducing two nights of prime-time programming by the end of 
next year. Holding on to those affiliates became a concern in the wake of Fox's 
unprecedented raid on CBS affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox last week snatched 12 VHF affiliates from the major networks, eight of 
them from CBS, in a bold bid to gain parity with ABC, CBS and NBC. The move has 
set off a domino effect among affiliates as the networks scramble to find new 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 While most industry executives think it would be wiser for Paramount and 
Warner Bros. to combine their competing networks rather than wage a war of 
attrition, implementing such a strategy may be all but impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to win valuable airspace in the biggest cities, both Paramount and 
Warner Bros. took on as partners some of the largest independent station groups 
in the country. Paramount's network is 50%-owned by Chris-Craft Industries, 
which controls eight TV stations, including KCOP-TV in Los Angeles, through its 
majority-owned subsidiary, BHC Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The WB network, which is being guided by Kellner and Garth Ancier, is 
launching a "hybrid" network in conjunction with the cable network WGN-TV and 
other independent TV stations owned by Tribune Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 One major obstacle to combining the two networks is a non-competition 
agreement between Paramount and Chris-Craft. Under the agreement, Paramount may 
not invest in another network for three years. In addition, the Tribune TV 
stations have long-term program contracts with Warner Bros., making it 
difficult for the studio to sever its ties. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fox's historic raid on established VHF affiliates has left both Paramount 
and Warner Bros. shaken. As the major networks begin to hunt for replacement 
affiliates, stations that have committed to either of the fifth networks are 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Paramount nor Warner Bros. can afford to lose affiliates, which would 
make it harder to achieve the 70% level of U.S. TV households needed to attract 
national advertisers. Indeed, it was in part to get around the shortage of 
available TV outlets that Warner Bros. partnered with "superstation" WGN-TV to 
increase its coverage area. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives familiar with the talks said that if either studio were to propose 
a merger, it would need the approval of its respective partners. And right now, 
the executives said, neither Chris-Craft nor Tribune appears willing.

A PRINCELY SUM WILL HELP BAIL OUT EURO DISNEY; TOURISM: NEPHEW OF SAUDI KING 
FAHD COMES TO RESCUE OF THE TROUBLED AMUSEMENT PARK WITH PLEDGE OF UP TO HALF A 
BILLION DOLLARS.

 "Someday, my prince will come . . . " -- Snow White, 1937  
</P>
<P>
 Someday was Wednesday for Walt Disney Co. and its partners in Euro Disney, as 
a Saudi Arabian prince pledged to invest up to $500 million in a plan designed 
to rescue the deeply troubled theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal Ibn Abdulaziz al Saud, who also owns large stakes 
in Citicorp and Saks Fifth Avenue, agreed to buy 13% to 24% of Euro Disney 
through a new stock offering that is the heart of a $1-billion bailout by 
investors and bankers aimed at turning around the money-losing park. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Al-Waleed agreed to put up $100 million in financing for a 
convention center being considered near the park 20 miles east of Paris. Such a 
center could attract additional visitors to the park and its hotels, 
particularly during midweek and the off-season, Euro Disney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co., which owns 49% of Euro Disney, could see its stake reduced to 
36% by a sale of shares to Al-Waleed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This significant investment and financing commitment by Prince Al-Waleed 
means that there is a strong, sophisticated new partner who shares our view of 
Euro Disney's future and whose involvement enhances Disney's major contribution 
to the Euro Disney financial restructuring package," Disney Chairman Michael D. 
Eisner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite becoming one of Europe's most popular destinations, Euro Disney has 
piled up nearly $4 billion in debt and posted mounting losses since it opened 
more than two years ago. The park's backers blame a European recession and 
lower-than-expected visitor spending for its financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a financial restructuring announced last month, Disney would forgo 
until 1998 royalties it is supposed to receive on the sale of tickets and 
merchandise at Euro Disney and inject more than $526 million into the park from 
proceeds of the new stock sale. In return, 61 creditor banks would forgive 18 
months of interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney is required to sell Al-Waleed up to $178 million worth of its new 
shares if the prince cannot buy a sufficient amount of the new shares from 
other shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Becoming a partner in the Euro Disney project is consistent with my strategy 
to invest significant amounts of capital in association with superior 
management teams around the world," Al-Waleed said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old prince, a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, has attracted 
attention in the past for his investments in well-known U.S. companies. In 
1991, he became the largest single investor in banking giant Citicorp by 
purchasing $800 million worth of company stock. Last year, he bought an 11% 
share of retailer Saks Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Al-Waleed's participation will ensure the completion of Euro 
Disney's financial restructuring, which is expected later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the theme park's future is not yet secured. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bigger issues are on the operating side," said entertainment industry 
analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. "How do you increase 
attendance and increase per-capita spending? That's a big challenge."

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: U.S. IS A FREE MARKET WHEN IT COMES TO CEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what do McKinsey & Co., Apple Computer Inc., Salomon Bros. Inc., Ford Motor 
Co., 3M and Compaq Computer Corp. have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, they enjoy success as multibillion-dollar global organizations 
with reputations for innovation. They are also uniquely American institutions 
whose roots reach deep into the spirit of risk taking and entrepreneurship. 
More intriguingly, the managing directors and chief executives of these 
companies today are all foreign-born and -bred and earned their reputations 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss in industry leaders like Coca-Cola's Robert Goizueta and Intel's Andrew 
Grove and it becomes clear we're at a unique moment in American business 
history. There has never been a time this century when so many leading U.S. 
companies have been run by chief executives who were not born and raised in 
this country. This is not an aberration; it's a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The globalization of the American executive suite will have an effect on 
industry at least as significant -- although not, perhaps, as traumatic -- as 
the globalization of the American work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The truly cynical might argue that the rising number of international CEOs is 
a signal that native-born Americans are no longer as competitive for the top 
spot as they once were, that native-born Americans are losing share in the 
hotly contested CEO marketplace.  
</P>
<P>
 In economic terms, the United States is running a huge balance of trade 
deficit in its import and export of global CEOs. Is now the time for CEO 
protectionism? Maybe Congress should pass laws requiring a domestic content 
provision for America's Fortune 500 CEOs. Or perhaps this should be referred to 
the Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for possible sanctions? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a more useful interpretation of this surge of foreign-born CEOs in 
American corporate ranks is that it's really a testament to the relative 
openness and flexibility of the United States' human capital markets. For all 
the criticism that American companies are too narrow in managerial scope and 
global vision, it is an empirical fact that leading U.S. companies employ 
disproportionately greater numbers of foreign nationals in their top ranks than 
do their counterparts in Europe, Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, many top U.S. companies care more about what you can do than where 
you are from. This may not make them unalloyed meritocracies, but it is clear 
that -- ironically? appropriately? paradoxically? -- the American notion of a 
global corporation does not disqualify non-Americans from the very top. 
</P>
<P>
 That's far more than can be said for the global companies of Asia and Europe. 
You won't find large European firms or a Japanese multinational led by an 
American. Indeed, you won't find a European company run by a Japanese or a 
Japanese company run by a European.  
</P>
<P>
 While it is certainly true that there are global companies like Royal Dutch 
Shell and Unilever that have uniquely multinational top management (albeit more 
European than global), for the most part these companies have intensely 
nationalistic notions of globalism. Their models of multinationalism are much 
more rigid and exclusionary along national boundaries.  
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to imagine the all-American but undeniably global Coca-Cola run by 
someone who wasn't born in the U.S.A.; it is almost impossible to imagine a set 
of circumstances where Nestle is run by someone other than a Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop down a management level or two and you still find the most extraordinary 
examples of nationalism uber alles. Few Americans can be found on German 
management boards or at the top levels of French corporate management. There 
are companies like Asea Brown Boveri that have invested in harvesting talent 
from all over the world, but they are defined as the exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, it stretches cultural credulity that a Mitsubishi, a Nomura, a 
Sumitomo, a Sony or a Daewoo will see a foreign CEO any time this generation. 
Yes, these companies are emphatically global, but their internal management 
marketplace is not. Only a handful of Japanese companies have foreigners on 
their management committees. Sony has an American, but NEC, Matsushita, Toyota 
and dozens of other Japanese companies that depend on the U.S. marketplace make 
it excruciatingly clear to their foreign nationals that "only this high and no 
higher" is their human capital philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 While issues of equity and opportunity are nice, the bottom-line issue is 
whether a free market in top management talent has an effect on profitability, 
market share and innovation. This is an easy hypothesis to test: Do 
organizations with more globally representative managements outperform those 
firms that define their management along nationalistic criteria? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, increasingly, will be yes -- and this will put increasing pressure 
on "foreign" companies to reconsider their own promotion philosophies. It may 
well be that human capital issues -- not the trans-border flow of goods and 
services -- will become the hot trade issue of the next decade. Is the stage 
being set for a management migration to companies that respect talent 
regardless of national origin? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a good case could be made that once a bright young mind is pummeled 
and molded by the Harvard Business School or Stanford's Graduate School of 
Business, it doesn't much matter whether it originally hailed from Toledo or 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the issue of whether we are now breeding managers and CEOs who 
hold greater loyalty to their corporations than to their countries may well be 
one of the most provocative that policy-makers and regulators in Europe, Asia 
and the Americas will have to struggle with for the next generation.

SILVER GETS MORE AUTHORITY THAN EXPECTED AT UNIVERSAL; ENTERTAINMENT: THE 
STUDIO EXECUTIVE WAS NAMED PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Casey Silver was named president of Universal Pictures on Wednesday and given 
broad new responsibilities, including the authority to "green light" movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Silver's promotion was expected in industry circles, some were 
surprised by the degree of autonomy he received.Universal said Silver, 39, will 
have control over all production, marketing and distribution at the studio, a 
division of MCA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver said he expects to "stay the course" at Universal, which has recently 
emerged from a long dry spell at the box office with Steven Spielberg-driven 
hits such as "Jurassic Park," "Schindler's List" and "The Flintstones." The 
latter grossed $37.5 million over the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make as many good movies as I can," Silver said. "I have no plans 
to change what we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Silver worked as president of production at Universal for five years. Hal 
Lieberman, executive vice president of production, is rumored to be the leading 
candidate to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver will report to Motion Picture Group Chairman Tom Pollock, who will 
become more involved in strategic planning. In particular, Pollock is expected 
to focus on the international film market and MCA's minority interest in 
Cineplex Odeon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I will do is what I've always done, which is try to provide leadership," 
said Pollock, who recently renewed his contract. "Casey is assuming a 
substantial amount of increased responsibility. But in my incarnation, I have 
also assumed quite a bit of additional responsibility within this company and 
in certain ventures outside the company."

POLITICIANS, COURT WARNED OF PROP. 103 RETALIATION; ELECTION: THE AUTHOR OF THE 
1988 INSURANCE ROLLBACK INITIATIVE SENDS MESSAGE TO VOTERS IN EFFORT TO AVOID 
ITS WEAKENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield sent a blunt warning to state 
legislators and the California Supreme Court on Wednesday, saying he will 
retaliate politically against those who try to weaken or overthrow the 1988 
insurance rollback initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days before the state primary election and oral arguments in a key 
Proposition 103 case before the Supreme Court, Rosenfield's organization ran a 
full-page advertisement in the West Coast edition of the New York Times that 
bore the huge headline, "Dirty Inside Deal Could Boost Your Insurance Premiums 
40% Overnight!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the ad and in a pamphlet mailed Wednesday to about 350,000 California 
households, Rosenfield identified politicians, jurists and others who he said 
have been hostile to the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time Rosenfield's organization has gone directly to voters 
in its effort to get Proposition 103 fully implemented. The group also 
solicited contributions to keep the publicity campaign going until the November 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield's nonprofit group, the Proposition 103 Enforcement Project, 
contends that the insurance industry -- which failed to defeat the proposition 
despite massive spending -- decided instead to thwart the measure through the 
Legislature and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Tuesday in Los Angeles, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a 
pivotal Proposition 103 case arising from Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi's order that 20th Century Insurance Co. pay $106 million in premium 
rebates and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A lower court struck down Garamendi's order as an unconstitutional 
infringement on the insurer's right to a fair profit. If that ruling holds, 
Rosenfield says, "consumers will have no protection against unjustified rates, 
and rapid increases will result." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield in March asked a majority of the Supreme Court -- four justices who 
were appointed by then-Gov. George Deukmejian -- to disqualify themselves from 
another Proposition 103-related case in which lawyer Deukmejian is representing 
an insurer. The justices refused to step aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In his mailers and newspaper ad, Rosenfield alluded to those cases and 
criticized the Legislature for passing -- and Gov. Pete Wilson for signing -- 
numerous bills he says have chipped away at Proposition 103 provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad included a 1989 group photo -- from an insurance trade publication -- 
of smiling state Sen. Patrick Johnston and then-Insurance Commissioner Roxani 
Gillespie. They are bracketed by then-Sen. Alan Robbins and lobbyist Clayton 
Jackson, both of whom were later convicted and sent to jail on 
insurance-related corruption charges. The ad said that Johnston (D-Stockton) 
has accepted $230,000 in contributions from insurance interests and has carried 
numerous anti-Proposition 103 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston, contacted Wednesday, said the photo amounted to "guilt by 
association." He said it was misleading to imply that he and Jackson were 
steadfast allies, considering that he once asked the Sacramento district 
attorney to investigate the lobbyist for suspected perjury in testimony he gave 
to a legislative panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who write initiatives often feel they've written the equivalent of the 
Ten Commandments" and resist any legislative tinkering, Johnston said. But no 
initiative -- or any other legislation -- is perfect, and requires 
modification, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor's not hostile to Prop. 103," Marjorie M. Berte, Wilson's 
insurance adviser, said Wednesday. A large, bipartisan majority of the 
Legislature passed the legislation, she said, "and we don't agree that those 
laws undermined the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court said none of the justices would comment on 
Rosenfield's allegations. Neither Deukmejian nor Gillespie returned phone calls 
seeking comment.

CORNING TO BUY MEDICAL LAB FOR $325 MILLION; MERGERS: DEAL WITH SAN JUAN 
CAPISTRANO-BASED NICHOLS INSTITUTE WOULD CREATE NATION'S LARGEST MEDICAL 
TESTING FIRM.

<P>
 Moving to create the nation's largest medical testing firm, Corning Inc. said 
Wednesday that it will buy the San Juan Capistrano-based Nichols Institute 
laboratory concern in a stock and debt deal valued at $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts generally praised the deal, which they said would help both companies 
survive in an industry being buffeted by consolidation and government-backed 
efforts at controlling medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols shareholders stand to reap a huge premium for their stock. Corning 
said its offer is equal to $13 a share, more than double Nichol's recent 
trading price. In trading on the American Stock Exchange on Wednesday, Nichols 
shares shot up $7.19 to close at $12. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The merger of Nichols -- which has laboratories in 11 states and makes test 
kits for doctors' offices and hospitals -- with Corning's Life Science unit 
would boost Corning into first place in the medical testing business over rival 
SmithKline Beecham. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, which said it had been reviewing its options, including a sale, had 
also held discussions with SmithKline Beecham.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is in the best interests of Nichols shareholders and employees," said 
analyst Joseph E. Millsap of the brokerage Morgan Keegan & Co. of Memphis, 
Tenn. "It solves enormous problems in an industry under intense pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy H. Thurman, president of Corning Life Sciences in Teterboro, N.J., said 
Corning, N.Y.-based Corning was particularly interested in Nichols because it 
has labs in markets that have been outside Corning's reach, particularly 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Nichols has one of the leading laboratories to perform 
non-traditional, advanced testing on the cutting edge of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the industry in the future moving into more high-technology," Thurman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols Chairman Albert L. Nichols said in a telephone interview Wednesday 
that his company, which lost $4.4 million on revenue of $279.6 million last 
year, needs a new direction in light of recent trends in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced the best way we can do that is to merge with Corning Life 
Sciences," said Nichols, who controls about 60% of the voting power of Nichols' 
common shares and who would become chairman emeritus and a board member of 
Corning Life Sciences after the buyout. He said that after hiring an investment 
banker to consider its options, the firm talked to SmithKline about being 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the definitive agreement, Corning said, it would acquire Nichols by 
issuing about 6.9 million new shares valued at a total of $222 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Corning said it has agreed to assume more than $100 million in 
Nichols debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, Corning shares closed at $32.37, 
down 50 cents.

OFFICIAL URGES SAFETY NET FOR U.S. WORKERS; JOBS: LABOR SECRETARY PUSHES 
ADOPTION OF RE-EMPLOYMENT ACT TO REVAMP JOBLESS INSURANCE AND TRAINING 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Declaring that job security is largely a thing of the past, U.S. Labor 
Secretary Robert B. Reich on Wednesday championed a Clinton Administration 
proposal to weave a new safety net for American workers dislocated by the 
increasingly unpredictable job market. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich, testifying at a congressional hearing held at East Los Angeles College, 
pushed for adoption of a bill, known as the Re-Employment Act, that would 
revamp the unemployment insurance system and consolidate major job-training 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor secretary said such a sweeping overhaul is needed because of the 
legions of people thrown out of work who, despite the nation's current economic 
recovery, have little or no chance of ever finding jobs as good as the ones 
they had. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time in this country to face the music. The old jobs aren't coming 
back," Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help put dislocated workers to work faster, the Re-Employment Act would 
provide for an array of innovations. Among other things, it would permit states 
to pay unemployment insurance benefits to jobless workers launching new 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also provide benefits to some job hunters who accept positions paying 
less than their previous positions and to others who take part-time jobs 
because they can't find full-time work. To receive extended unemployment 
benefits, however, workers would have to be enrolled in long-term retraining 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another aim of the proposal is to provide a more efficient way to find 
openings for job-seekers. To that end, the act would set up a computerized 
database of job listings. In addition, "one-stop" employment service centers 
would be set up so job hunters would not be bounced from one government agency 
to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said support for the act is building, and he noted that this week it 
picked up its first Republican co-sponsor, U.S. Sen. Mark O. Hatfield of 
Oregon. Reich said he is upbeat about prospects for passage of the measure this 
year but conceded that changes would be likely. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the act has been criticized by everyone from business groups worried 
that the costs of the programs will escalate, to union leaders who fear the 
loss of existing worker assistance programs. It has also been faulted for 
neglecting the needs of the nation's hard-core unemployed.  
</P>
<P>
 State and local agencies, meanwhile, have complained that the act would limit 
their flexibility. Virginia Hamilton, an official with the California 
Employment Development Department, testified at the hearing that state 
officials believe the act would impose too many mandates on the state. At the 
same time, she said, it would not go far enough in consolidating the federal 
government's more than 150 job training programs.

CBS HOPES TO REPLACE 8 AFFILIATES SOON; TELEVISION: 'WE'RE GOING TO SPEND 
WHATEVER IT TAKES,' THE NETWORK SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 CBS Inc., which last week lost eight key affiliates to Fox in the largest 
defection of stations to a rival network in history, said it hopes to have most 
of those replaced within the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a Century City news conference after the first day of its affiliates 
convention, the network was evasive about which stations will become its new 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to spend whatever it takes," CBS Chief Executive Laurence A. 
Tisch said. "We're going to have good affiliates in those markets. We're going 
to be No. 1 in programming -- that's where the battle is going to be fought." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Tisch downplayed speculation that the affiliate defections 
would force CBS to pay more in so-called compensation payments, the money the 
networks pay affiliates to carry their programming. "I don't think there will 
be any (across-the-board) increases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first public statement since the Fox raid, Tisch was guarded in his 
remarks about Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of Fox parent News Corp., saying, 
"He had to do what he thought was best for his company." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS affiliates looking for a definitive move by the network to replace 
stations lost to Fox expressed disappointment. There had been expectations that 
the network would come to its affiliate convention with a deal in place. 
</P>
<P>
 William Sullivan, president of WPAX-TV in Missoula, Mont., and head of the CBS 
affiliates advisory committee, said CBS stations were "looking for confidence" 
from the network. "By Friday we should have some indication where we're going," 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, CBS lost the National Football League contract to Fox after 
being outbid by $400 million. Peter Tortorici, president of CBS Entertainment, 
said the network will replace its Sunday afternoon football games with new 
made-for-TV movies and network TV premieres of theatrical films in a bid to 
counter-program with female-oriented broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch said CBS is looking at buying additional TV stations and that it will 
urge the Federal Communications Commission to lift ownership rules that limit 
the number of TV stations a broadcaster is permitted to own. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Tisch unapologetically defended his strategy to keep CBS focused on its 
core business rather than on diversifying into related businesses such as cable 
TV. In recent years, ABC, NBC and Fox have all launched cable channels and 
invested in overseas broadcasting ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a businessman," Tisch declared. "I've been around a long time. (CBS) has 
over $1 billion in the bank earning money every day. There is no better asset." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how long he will continue to control CBS -- Tisch was named chairman in 
1987 after buying 25% of CBS stock -- he attributed his reply to friend and 
legendary investor Warren Buffett: "I hope to retire 10 years after I die."

 Macy Sets Date for Reorganization Plan: R.H. Macy & Co. said it will file a 
detailed bankruptcy reorganization plan June 30, about one month before a 
court-imposed deadline for submitting such a proposal. Macy, whose holdings 
include the Bullock's and I. Magnin department store chains, hopes to garner 
support from its creditors when it releases the plan. If Macy is unable to 
obtain adequate support for the plan, the court could ask Federated Department 
Stores or other parties to submit rival proposals.

INDUSTRY REPORTS INDICATE SOLID JOB GROWTH; EMPLOYMENT: MAY FIGURES SHOW THE 
FASTEST INCREASE IN MORE THAN FIVE YEARS, PURCHASING MANAGERS SAY.

 Manufacturing jobs grew in May at the fastest pace in more than five years as 
production roared ahead for the ninth straight month, the nation's purchasing 
managers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said that of the 20 industries in 
the manufacturing sector, 18 reported stronger businesses last month than in 
April. It was the largest number to report gains since March, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, the tone of the economic numbers is quite solid," said economist 
David Jones of Aubrey G. Langston & Co. Inc. "It's the kind of strength that 
leads to more orders, more employment, more production and more growth." 
</P>
<P>
 The group said its overall index held at 57.7% for May, the same as for April. 
A reading above 50% indicates that manufacturing is generally expanding, 
whereas a reading below 50% points to a decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which is based in Tempe, Ariz., said the robust activity caused 
prices to rise across the board for manufacturers, sparking more inflation 
fears and initially causing bond yields to rise and stocks to fall. The 
markets, however, ended with a gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic growth continued at the same strong rate in May as in April, 
resulting in the broadest increase in manufacturing employment since late 1988 
and the most widespread price increases paid by the manufacturing (sector) 
since October, 1990," said Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the group's Business 
Survey Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists, however, said prices were rising for the commodities manufacturers 
use to make their goods and not the retail prices consumers pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the inflation story is a future story," Jones said. "We're not 
getting as much on the inflation side as we normally would in this stage of a 
rebound." 
</P>
<P>
 The NAPM employment index surged to 52 last month from 50.8 in April, making 
for the second straight gain and the highest level since December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacturing group said its price index picked up last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found widespread price increases, with the index rising to 71.5% 
for last month.

 Fleming to Buy Scrivner: The two rival food distributors have agreed to merge 
in a $1-billion deal that would create the nation's leading supplier to grocery 
stores and supermarkets.The purchase by Oklahoma City-based Fleming Companies 
Inc. of cross-town competitor Scrivner Inc., owned by Franz Haniel & Cie, a 
privately held German company, marks the latest combination in a business that 
has been consolidating for some time. Under terms of the deal, Fleming would 
purchase Scrivner's stock for $1.085 billion in cash and keep the Fleming name. 
If approved by shareholders and regulators, the merger would generate combined 
sales revenue of about $19 billion, making Fleming the nation's largest food 
distributor.

 Miles Inc. Reportedly Under Investigation: The Pittsburgh-based pharmaceutical 
company is being investigated for a now-halted program that paid pharmacists to 
steer patients to Adalat CC, Miles' medication for high blood pressure, the 
Wall Street Journal reported this week.A federal anti-kickback law forbids any 
person or company from offering cash or in-kind payment to get business under 
Medicare or Medicaid, two federal health care programs. In a statement, Miles 
said it is involved in confidential talks with the government over the program, 
which it called "lawful and constructive." Under the program, Miles paid 
drugstores $35 if a customer switched to its drug from Procardia Xl, sold by 
Pfizer Inc.

 Viacom and Tele-Communications Ponder Joint Ventures: Sources said the two 
cable companies are very close to structuring an agreement to settle their 
legal disputes, though formally agreeing to a deal could take more than 30 days 
as the companies await final rules on cable rates from the FCC. Viacom is 
weighing proposals to place its West Coast cable systems in San Francisco and 
nearby Marin County and in Puget Sound, Wash., in an operating joint venture 
with Tele-Communications Inc., while in the East, Viacom Inc. may place its 
Nashville system in a joint venture with TCI's 31%-owned Intermedia Partners, 
which owns systems in Knoxville and west Tennessee. A West Coast joint venture 
alone could save $30 million to $40 million in operating costs, a source said.

 Murdoch's TV Station Deal Probed: Federal regulators are reviewing their 
approval of Rupert Murdoch's 1985 acquisition of six big-city television 
stations, including one in Los Angeles. The government is investigating whether 
the purchase violated federal laws prohibiting foreign ownership of U.S. 
broadcasting properties. If so, it could have multibillion-dollar consequences 
for Murdoch and the company he controls, News Corp. The stations -- also in 
Washington, New York, Chicago, Dallas and Houston -- formed the basis for the 
Fox television network.

 Software Firm to Settle Suit: Platinum Software Corp., the maker of accounting 
software whose bookkeeping practices got it into legal trouble, said it has 
agreed to settle a class-action shareholder lawsuit for $17 million.Under the 
agreement, the Irvine-based firm would pay $2 million in cash and issue $15 
million in corporate IOUs. A group of Platinum shareholders filed suit in 
January alleging that the company violated securities regulations. The suit 
prompted an internal accounting review. In April, the company acknowledged that 
it had overstated revenue for the past 18 months, prompting four top 
executives, including founder Gerald R. Blackie, to resign.

straight month, the National Assn. of Purchasing Management said.The group said 
that of the 20 industries in the manufacturing sector, 18 reported stronger 
business last month than in April. It was the largest number to report gains 
since March, 1990. "Generally, the tone of the economic numbers is quite 
solid," said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston & Co.

 U.S. Facilities Challenges Vote for Directors: The Costa Mesa insurance 
holding company, which shareholders voted last week to put up for sale, filed 
suit to challenge the election of two directors nominated by Fidelity National 
Financial Inc., which is pursuing a $79-million hostile takeover. U.S. 
Facilities said independent vote tabulators improperly disqualified 80,386 
votes that could have swung the election to management's slate of directors. In 
unrelated Wall Street activity, Fidelity's stock price fell $1.625 to $14.875 
on the New York Stock Exchange after a Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst lowered his 
estimates for earnings this year.

DOW STAGES LATE RALLY AS BOND YIELDS RETREAT 
</P>

<P>
 Blue chip stocks rebounded from an early 30-point drop to close modestly 
higher as long-term bond yields retreated after bouncing sharply higher in 
early trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, as well as broader stock performance 
indicators, managed to end with modest gains after trading with deficits for 
most of the day. At the close, the Dow industrials sported an increase of 2.46, 
bringing the blue chip gauge to 3,760.83. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the long bond finished the day at 7.39%, down from 
Tuesday's 7.43% as tumbling commodity prices contributed to an afternoon buying 
spree in bonds. The 30-year bond's price, down more than one-half point in 
early trading, ended up 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value. Bond yields 
and prices move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, advancing stocks held the majority in the closing tally on the 
New York Stock Exchange, outpacing declines by about 5 to 4. Big Board volume 
expanded to 278.46 million shares from 215.61 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market measures also closed higher. The NYSE composite index rose 0.61 
to 252.85, and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 1.13 to 457.63. The 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks finished on positive ground at 
735.52, up 0.33. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, traders dumped bonds after the National Assn. of Purchasing 
Management's monthly report on business fanned inflation fears. At the height 
of the morning selling, the Dow average was down about 25 points and the key 
30-year bond was off nearly 3/4 point. 
</P>
<P>
 The report showed steady growth in the nation's manufacturing sector, 
reinforcing the view that the economic expansion hasn't slowed to any 
significant degree. 
</P>
<P>
 However, details about prices obtained from the survey were particularly 
upsetting for bond traders. The survey showed the widest price increases since 
October, 1990. It also indicated that suppliers are having trouble delivering 
materials on time, which can put further pressure on prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But Treasury bond prices reversed direction by early afternoon in a shift in 
market sentiment brought on by a sharp drop in prices of precious metals and 
other commodities, sending the Commodity Research Bureau index down 1.61 to 
233.84. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold weakened the New York Comex, closing at $383.50 an ounce, off $3.60 an 
ounce. Silver finished at $5.333 an ounce, down 20.3 cents an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 Slumping stock and bond prices in several of the major European financial 
centers didn't have a lasting impact on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights on Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer chip makers' stocks rallied after optimistic comments about the 
outlook for one company, Xilinx, sparked enthusiasm about the entire sector. 
Xilinx surged 5 3/4 to 46 3/4 and carried others aloft, such as Motorola, which 
rose 1 3/8 to 48 1/8, and Texas Instruments, up 4 3/8 to 84 5/8, 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Surgical zoomed up 2 3/4 to 21 3/4 in heavy NYSE trading amid rumors 
that the Swiss drug company Ciga-Geigy might be considering making a takeover 
bid for it. Both companies declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the session's biggest losers was IDB Communications, which plunged 7 
3/8 to 7 1/8 on news that its auditor, Deloitte & Touche, had resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among bank stocks, Chemical Bank rose 1 3/8 to 39 3/4, Chase Manhattan added 
1 5/8 to 39 3/8 and Citicorp advanced 1 1/8 to 40 5/8. Insurers American 
International Group gained 1 3/4 to 95 1/8 and Chubb ended up 2 to 82 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, London's Financial Times 100-share average fell 38.6 
points to 2,931.9, its lowest finish since last July. In Frankfurt, the DAX 
30-share average ended up 2 points at 2,129.70. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei 
average ended up 79.52 points at 21,053.11. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index closed 44.75 points lower at 2,438.98. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency market, the dollar was lower in global foreign exchange 
trading Wednesday, falling modestly as stock and bond prices plunged on 
inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar fetched 104.55 Japanese yen, down from 104.85 yen late 
Tuesday and 1.646 German marks, down from 1.647.

YOUR MONEY; COALITION DEMANDS LOWER ELECTRICITY BILLS; ENERGY: CONSUMER AND 
BUSINESS GROUPS PRESENT STUDY SHOWING THAT CALIFORNIA RATES ARE UNFAIRLY HIGH. 
UTILITIES, ANALYSTS QUESTION METHODOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Demanding deep rate cuts over the next five years, an unprecedented coalition 
of consumer and business groups issued a report Wednesday contending that 
Californians pay more than a third too much to the state's three big 
investor-owned electric utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The study estimates that Californians paid an extra $6.4 billion in 1992 -- 
out of $18 billion in bills that year -- to Southern California Edison Co., San 
Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Both utility executives and independent analysts expressed skepticism about 
the methodology of the study, conducted by Economic Sciences Corp., a 
Berkeley-based consulting firm. The study aimed to factor out circumstances 
such as weather and other local conditions to compare the operating efficiency 
of utilities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they have developed the level playing field that they assert 
they have in the report," said Tom Bottorff, manager of rates for San 
Francisco-based PG&E. Bottorff said PG&E's rates have risen at less than the 
rate of inflation over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition -- which includes the California Manufacturers Assn. and 
California Farm Bureau Federation, as well as groups representing small 
businesses and homeowners -- called on the utilities to slash their rates by 
25% over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the operating expenses of California's electric 
utilities are among the nation's most costly. It also says the utilities' rates 
have increased three to four times faster in recent years than have others in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the results of the study are particularly surprising for 
anybody who has been following the electric industry in California for any 
time," said Audrie Krause, executive director of Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization, a consumer group based in San Francisco. "Things have really 
gotten out of hand here." 
</P>
<P>
 It has long been known that California's electricity rates are relatively high 
-- about 50% above the national average. But Edison, for one, blames such 
factors as the high cost of long-term contracts for renewable energy and other 
requirements imposed by state regulators over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're buying energy today as if it were being manufactured by $100-a-barrel 
oil," said Robert H. Bridenbecker, an Edison vice president. These independent 
contracts, mandated by the state Public Utilities Commission, cost a premium of 
$1.2 billion annually, Edison estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Krause and others in the consumer coalition plan to use the study's findings 
as they assess the PUC's proposal for deregulating the state's investor-owned 
electric utilities.  
</P>
<P>
 That plan, announced last month, would ultimately allow all California 
customers to choose their electricity suppliers, beginning in 1996 with large 
industrial users. In setting rates for customers who want to continue relying 
on their local utility -- and the rates for transmitting and distributing power 
from all sources -- the PUC has proposed a system that would reward utilities 
for efficient operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the commission expects rates to decline through the competitive 
forces of the marketplace, consumer groups have expressed concern that the PUC 
proposals do not specifically require lower electricity rates.

YOUR MONEY; STUDY FINDS ATM CHARGES UP, COSTS DOWN; FINANCE: CONSUMER GROUP 
SAYS BANKS EARNED $2 BILLION IN PROFITS FROM THE MACHINES. BANKERS CALL THE 
FEES JUSTIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Consumers are paying top dollar to banks through automatic teller machines, 
even though banks are saving money in labor costs and paperwork by replacing 
human tellers with machines, a consumer group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the start of the summer travel season, consumers should take extra steps 
to ensure they are not overcharged for ATM use, the Consumer Federation of 
America said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers, for their part, see no need to apologize, saying ATMs deliver a 
valuable service. Rather, they argue, consumers should shop around for the best 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
 ATM cardholders are handing over an average of $37 a year in profits to their 
banks from automatic teller use, according to the consumer group's study, which 
is based on industry data. Cardholders use an ATM an average of 6.7 times a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, banks made nearly $2 billion in profits from ATM business. That 
covers $2.90 billion in ATM transaction fees and savings of $2.34 billion by 
not using human tellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they save money by substituting machines for humans, banks have raised 
ATM fees as much as three times the rate of inflation over the past three 
years, the Washington-based consumer group said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout the economy, self-service facilities result in lower costs for the 
consumer," said Chris Lewis, a spokesman for the group. "But in banking, 
self-service is regarded as a privilege for which the consumer is required to 
pay a premium for saving the bank money." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said the cost savings of electronic banking "are not trickling down to 
consumers" because more banks are charging ATM fees and those fees "are 
climbing higher and higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Teller machines permit consumers to withdraw money or deposit funds without 
the help of a bank employee. Regional and national networks allow customers 
from different banks to do routine service while hundreds or even thousands of 
miles from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers feel they have no need to repent for the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't apologize for the fees," said Ed Alwood of the American Bankers 
Assn. "We think we deliver a valuable service, and obviously our customers do 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "People must shop around for the type of mix of fees and services 
that fit their needs." 
</P>
<P>
 To cut costs, the consumer group urged consumers -- especially summer 
travelers -- to use their own bank's ATMs whenever possible. The study said 
only 11.7% of banks charge their own customers an ATM fee, and that fee 
averages about 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, 82.3% of banks levy fees on consumers who are not their account 
holders, and those fees are much higher.

 Almost all frequent fliers know the value of accumulating frequent-flier 
mileage points. We know you can earn miles by flying on a particular airline, 
but there are many other ways to watch your mileage statements grow. 
</P>
<P>
 One is by using credit cards. I charge everything I can on my 
airline-affiliated credit cards. That includes business expenses. I always use 
personal credit cards rather than company-issued cards on business outings, 
simply to obtain the miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many distributors accept credit cards, and I have seen people earn several 
hundred thousand miles a year by charging company expenses on the card. 
However, some card providers and airlines now limit the number of miles that 
can be earned with them.  
</P>
<P>
 You can also earn miles with the phone. I spend about $1,000 a month on 
long-distance calls that earn five miles for every dollar spent. That comes to 
5,000 frequent-flier miles a month. If you travel frequently on a particular 
airline, you can quickly reach "premium" status and accumulate credits more 
quickly. For example, I flew 60,000 miles in one year on Delta and reached the 
Royal Medallion level. Now my miles are credited at 1 1/2 times the rate of 
other fliers. The miles really add up fast. 
</P>
<P>
 By using the same airline (and rental car companies and hotels), I accumulate 
frequent-user program benefits fast. You too will be traveling for free!  
</P>
<P>
 I apologize to my travel agent.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; UNDER THE WEATHER OVERSEAS? HERE'S 
AN RX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting sick on the road, especially overseas, can be a disaster for business 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the cost or inconvenience of missed meetings that can turn a 
sprained ankle or a sore throat into a crisis. In many parts of the world, 
antibiotics, clean needles, good blood supplies and trained specialists are not 
readily available. Ailments as common as strep throat can lead to death if left 
untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, eight out of 10 travelers don't think through in advance how they 
would handle a medical emergency on their trips, said Dr. Claude Cadoux, a 
travel medicine specialist and medical director for Medex Assistance Corp. in 
Frederick, Md., which provides international medical assistance and evacuation 
services for U.S. business travelers abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. companies are sending employees on business trips to an increasing number 
of locations, many of them in remote areas, said Jack Shettle, president of 
Medex. Business-travel-related cases are increasing at a rate of about 35% a 
year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common problems encountered by business travelers are ailments such 
as sprains, strains and fractures, Cadoux said. The others, in order of 
frequency: ear, nose and throat disorders; infectious diseases, such as the flu 
and malaria; cardiovascular disorders, with heart attacks and chest pains 
causing the most hospitalizations abroad, and gastrointestinal disorders, 
including ulcers and appendicitis. 
</P>
<P>
 But those aren't the only problems. John Fazio, corporate travel manager for 
Mitsubishi Electronics in Cypress, recalls one employee who delivered more than 
her presentation while on a business trip -- she delivered her baby a month 
earlier than expected. Fazio said the company's 24-hour travel management 
system helped her reach a city where she had relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fairly common for traveling employees who get sick to interrupt their 
trips by staying over in a connecting city, Fazio said. In that case, the 
company arranges for a hotel and a doctor or whatever attention is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of steps business travelers can take before a trip to 
prepare for illness that can prevent a routine or mild medical problem from 
turning into an emergency. Here are some suggestions from Cadoux; David 
Stempler, director of the Washington-based International Airline Passengers 
Assn., and the International Assn. for Medical Assistance to Travelers. The 
latter group is a nonprofit organization based in Lewiston, N.Y., that provides 
disease information and an international list of English-speaking doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Before You Go: Make a list of current medications, including dosages, in case 
you need to relay the information to a foreign doctor or refill a prescription 
overseas. Even better, carry enough medication to cover you for the length of 
time you will be away. 
</P>
<P>
 Check your health insurance. Many health plans do not cover you once you leave 
the United States, Stempler said. If you are not covered, consider purchasing a 
travel insurance plan. These plans are offered by a number of companies, 
including Travel Guard International, International SOS Assistance, US Assist, 
Travel Assistance International, Medex, Health Care Abroad, HealthCare Global, 
Carefree Travel Insurance, Access America, American Express Travel Protection 
Plan, TravelAssure and Travel Insured International. 
</P>
<P>
 Before purchasing travel insurance, make sure you understand coverage limits 
and whether the policy covers the cost of evacuation to the closest medical 
facility. Evacuations can cost $6,000 to $30,000 or more, Shettle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, check with your employer to see whether you are covered under any 
additional trip insurance plans. Make sure you understand any exclusions or 
waiting periods that apply to pre-existing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a chronic medical problem, get checked before you go so you know 
you can safely travel and are sure the problem is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Carry a brief clinical history with you, especially if you have pre-existing 
conditions. The International Assn. for Medical Assistance to Travelers gives 
members a card to fill out detailing their medical condition; call (716) 
754-4883. Medex soon plans to offer a plastic card that can contain both a 
traveler's medical history and a copy of his or her EKG. Or ask your doctor to 
write down information that someone treating you in a foreign country would 
need to know, especially any food or drug allergies you have. 
</P>
<P>
 Carry an information card with phone numbers of a relative in the United 
States, as well as your doctor's phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Call the U.S. Consular Affairs Office ((202) 647-5225) and the Centers for 
Disease Control in Atlanta ((404) 639-3311) for recorded health advisory 
information on countries you will be traveling to. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider consulting a travel medicine specialist (these can be found through 
most major hospitals) to see whether there are additional vaccines that, though 
not required, might be advisable for traveling in some parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 What to Pack: Make sure you pack half your medications in your carry-on 
baggage and half in your checked bags so that if either gets lost or stolen you 
still have medication. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are traveling to a remote location, consider carrying an emergency 
first-aid kit. In addition to standard items such as bandaging materials and 
disinfectants, the kit should contain needles, syringes and non-reusable 
adapters for hooking up IV fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times the local doctors are quite competent, but they won't have 
supplies to work with," Cadoux said.

 Czech Banking Law Decision Delayed: The government put off action as thousands 
of depositors are scurrying to transfer money from failing banks in the Czech 
Republic.Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said making a decision was "more difficult 
than we thought" and that the issue too emotionally charged at a time when two 
troubled banks have shut down. The proposals -- revisions of a 1992 banking law 
enacted before the breakup of the former Czechoslovakia -- would create a 
deposit insurance fund to protect a portion of deposits at all banks and end 
the government's total guarantee of deposits at four formerly state-owned large 
banks. In recent weeks, one bank has shut its doors and another has frozen its 
deposits.

 Philippines Shows Surprisingly High First-Quarter Growth: The economy, which 
has lagged behind those of its booming neighbors in Southeast Asia for a 
decade, grew 4.84% for the quarter, the government reported. The gross domestic 
product figures exceed even the most optimistic forecasts by the government and 
the private sector, sending share prices on the Philippine Stock Exchange up 
2.76%.

PROFILE; INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; LEFTIST-TURNED-CAPITALIST LEADS CHILEAN PHONE 
COMPANY; LATIN AMERICA: OSCAR GARRETON PURCELL DISCOVERED HIS FASCINATION WITH 
BUSINESS WHILE EXILED IN COMMUNIST CUBA. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As chairman of Compania de Telefonos de Chile, Oscar Garreton Purcell heads 
one of Wall Street's most closely watched Latin American companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnate behind the partners desk at CTC's fancy headquarters is hardly 
your typical capitalist, however. He is a former revolutionary firebrand who 
engineered the telephone company's seizure under an earlier government. 
</P>
<P>
 What changed him? "The business world seduced me," said Garreton, now 50. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more to it than that, of course. Garreton's career as an assistant 
finance minister in President Salvador Allende's Socialist government came to 
an abrupt end in 1973 with the military coup in which Allende was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
 Garreton found refuge for eight months in the Colombian Embassy. Later, he 
spent 15 years in exile in Colombia, Cuba and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 In Havana, Garreton was a Communist bureaucrat. He ran Chile's left-wing Mapu 
underground and traveled to secret meetings with its leaders in Madrid and 
Paris. (He said he remains grateful for the way Fidel Castro's government 
treated him, and he praised Cuba's advances in medicine, education and social 
programs.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Cuba that Garreton first got the itch to run a business. When the 
Cubans flirted with the idea of private ownership of small businesses, 
Garreton's wife began selling clothing and farm products. Garreton was 
intrigued as customers appeared in droves, eager to buy what the Castro regime 
could not provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," Garreton said. "You'd see things that hadn't been seen in 
years, but it couldn't work in that society. . . . The government wouldn't 
allow it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garreton left Cuba in 1983 for Buenos Aires, where he worked as a radio 
commentator and in an import-export business, shipping grain to Bolivia and 
farm equipment to Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, he returned to Chile -- and was jailed for eight months on sedition 
charges. He was released after he agreed to refrain from all political 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, democracy returned to Chile and Garreton was named to head 
the Santiago subway system. He began running what used to be a money-losing 
government agency as if it were a private corporation, cutting costs by opening 
bidding to small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the private investors who had bought the phone company back from 
the government hired Garreton to run it. He acknowledges that, in a world where 
the Soviet Union's collapse has made his youthful dreams seem a folly, he's a 
changed person. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he dreams of profits in a multimedia future of video conferences, movies 
on demand and wireless communicators. Garreton's leftist dogma has been 
replaced by a corporate credo of making money for stockholders -- among them 
the foreign owners of CTC's New York-listed shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But shareholders have taken quite a beating in recent months. Trading at a 
record high of $133.75 on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year, CTF 
shares plunged after Chilean regulators in effect reset the company's rates. 
Shares were up 12.5 cents Wednesday at $91.125. 
</P>
<P>
 Garreton is charismatic these days in preaching the gospel of capitalism and 
has earned respect as a manager. He is excited about spreading CTC's wealth 
among its thousands of shareholders and giving employees decision-making power. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazing out a window in his office, almost within sight of the Colombian 
Embassy that had provided him political refuge 20 years ago, Garreton took a 
philosophical view of the way his career has shifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my destiny," he said.

 Cigarette, Alcohol Prices Soar in Cuba: The government has begun a series of 
increases, announced a week ago, intended to help sort out the country's 
chaotic internal finances.Cigarettes, the prices of which vary according to a 
ration system, rose four- to tenfold, and rum went up about three times and 
beer's price doubled. However a threefold rise in the price of gasoline, which 
had also been due to take effect, was postponed. Authorities on the 
Communist-ruled Caribbean island, which is suffering from a severe economic 
crisis, said the measures will be painful but are necessary to cut the budget 
deficit.

 South Korea's economy is expanding rapidly again after two years of modest 
growth, in large part because of the recent surge in the value of the Japanese 
yen, which makes Korean exports cheaper relative to comparable Japanese 
products. Growth has also been aided by increased demand for Korean products.

MAKE FRESH ASPARAGUS TASTE JUST LIKE CANNED! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canned asparagus was one of my favorite childhood foods. Really. Once my aunt, 
a considerably more adventuresome cook than her sister (my mom), served frozen 
asparagus. I didn't dislike it, exactly, but. . . 
</P>
<P>
 And fresh asparagus -- well, there was a major disappointment. I missed the 
dullish olive-green color, really mushy texture and slightly disagreeable aroma 
of canned. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother would heat the canned stalks with their liquid, add a pinch of salt 
and pepper and a nut of butter. When she served mashed potatoes with them, the 
asparagus juice became gravy for the potatoes, and so happy was I that I still 
get hungry simply reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, asparagus is my favorite vegetable and a food that's pretty near 
the top of the list of my favorite things. Happily, I've identified the exact 
flavor of childhood memory and know how to achieve it while maintaining the 
other charms of fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asparagus needs to cook to a certain point of tenderness to release its 
wonderful, murky flavor and aroma. Cooked al dente, it has a different one -- 
sort of grassy -- and less of it. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin, there are a couple of things you need to know about buying 
asparagus. Although they are all the same variety, asparagus comes in three 
colors -- white, purple and green. White asparagus is cultivated in mulch. 
Since they are always from mature root stock, the spears are very thick. And 
because the spears are cut as soon as they emerge into sunlight, they are 
squat. They are also very woody and must be heavily peeled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the plant uses its sugar store to develop its outer woody surface, white 
asparagus can be a tad bitter, but in an agreeable way. Since it's not grown in 
sunlight, though, it's lacking the chlorophyll flavor that the green variety 
has, so it's more bitter than the fat green spears. Cook in boiling, salted 
water about eight to 10 minutes, or until completely tender. White asparagus is 
sturdier than the others, and that point of cooking perfection between crisp 
and overcooked is more forgiving. To me, white asparagus is as robust as a 
piece of meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple asparagus is white asparagus that is left to grow a bit taller in the 
light, but whose chlorophyll has not yet turned the stalks green. It lacks both 
the charming bitter edge of white and the sweetness of green. It too requires 
peeling, but it is generally less thick than white. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Green asparagus is, in my opinion, the best. It has a nice balance between 
sweetness and bitterness and a strong "asparagus" flavor. Thin stalks of 
asparagus come from young root stocks. They are tender and don't require 
peeling or preliminary blanching. They also have little flavor and are nice to 
throw into vegetable ragouts or used to garnish fish, poultry and white meats. 
They're good cut up and stir-fried. They're cute, but not serious. What else 
can you say? Simply trim off the bottom inch of the stalk and blanch stalks for 
1 1/2 to two minutes in salted boiling water. 
</P>
<P>
 Medium-size stalks are sweet but don't have what I describe as a strong 
essence-of-asparagus flavor, that flavor sort of between the astringency of an 
artichoke and the sulfuric odor of overcooked broccoli. They require no 
peeling, but the stalk ends are stringy and must be trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way of knowing where to trim is to snap each stalk individually. The 
stalk should snap at the point where it becomes tender. If you're not inclined 
to snap each one, then do three or four, assume that all the stalks have about 
the same degree of woodiness and trim the rest of the stalks with a knife. Boil 
in copious amounts of salted water about five to seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jumbo green asparagus is the best of all, the king of vegetables. Its store of 
sugar has been used to develop the stringy, not woody, outer skin, and its 
green chlorophyll flavor has developed. The texture is tender yet meaty. Cook 
jumbo asparagus until tender, but not mushy, about eight to 10 minutes. Here 
you need to be more accurate than when cooking white asparagus. You want tender 
spears, neither crisp nor mushy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In order to avoid overcooking the tender asparagus tips, some people tie 
asparagus into bundles and stand them in water in specially designed asparagus 
cookers. I find that it's more important to cook asparagus in a larger quantity 
of water than is possible using an asparagus cooker. If carefully handled, the 
tips shouldn't get damaged, even when cooked in a large pot. 
</P>
<P>
 I prefer eating my asparagus simply, with a little lemon and butter or with a 
drizzle of vinaigrette. Use the jumbo variety to make a wonderful soup. Here's 
where the rule "freshest is best" doesn't apply. I prefer to use asparagus 
that's a bit old -- that has been in the market a bit too long -- to make soup. 
It has a stronger asparagus flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 I've even developed a way of cooking asparagus that nearly reminds me of the 
canned variety that hooked me as a child. Actually it's a lot better. Place the 
asparagus in a skillet with some salted water and cook it until the water is 
nearly evaporated. Whisk in a nut of butter and serve the asparagus in its own 
juices. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, I've retried the canned version and, believe me, it's best left as 
a memory. ASPARAGUS IN ITS OWN JUICES

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; REDUCTION IN BIXBY PARK TRAFFIC PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council wants to close Bixby Park to through traffic during rush 
hours and thus reduce the number of drivers who cut through the park and nearby 
neighborhoods to avoid busy Ocean Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a proposal introduced by Councilmen Alan S. Lowenthal and Douglas S. 
Drummond, park gates at 1st Street and Cherry Avenue and 2nd Street and 
Junipero Avenue would be closed from 4 p.m. to 9 a.m. on weekdays.Currently, 
those gates are closed from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 7-1 last week to ask the city attorney to draw up an 
ordinance that would expand the hours that the park would be closed to through 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Evan Anderson Braude opposed the new hours, saying he was denied a 
similar request to block traffic in his downtown district. Councilwoman Doris 
Topsy-Elvord was absent. EMILY ADAMS

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SOUTH GATE; CITY OFFICES TO OPEN ON FRIDAYS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a new, temporary schedule at City Hall under 
which city offices will be open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. every weekday. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other Southeast L.A. County cities, South Gate government offices have 
been closed on Fridays during the past year to reduce employee commutes and 
meet Air Quality Management District standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most employees prefer the four-day workweek, and when I was campaigning I 
heard very few complaints about it from residents," said Councilwoman Mary Ann 
Buckles, who cast the lone dissenting vote May 10. "I see no reason to change 
it if it's working." 
</P>
<P>
 A five-day week would could mean a reduction in customer service because City 
Hall employees would stagger their work schedules, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 For the next three months, staff may choose to come to work five eight-hour 
days or take Monday or Friday off. The council will evaluate public demand for 
service and then negotiate new hours with the employee unions, officials said.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: BELL GARDENS; WORKERS TO BID FOR SHARE OF CARD CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bicycle Club employees have taken a small but important step toward buying the 
federal government's stake in the card casino by winning the support, however 
narrowly, of the City Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employees are ecstatic," said attorney Regina Saborsky of the Beverly 
Hills-based firm Rosenfeld, Meyer & Susman, which represents the 2,100 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 card dealers, waitresses and other workers packed City Hall May 
23 to ask council members, who also serve as the redevelopment agency, to 
support their efforts to form an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The ESOP would, 
in essence, buy out the government's 36% interest in the casino and set up a 
pension plan for workers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government became a general partner in the card club after 
officials uncovered a complex racketeering and money-laundering scheme and 
seized about a third of the club's assets. In April, 1990, a federal jury found 
that one Bicycle Club investor had used $12 million in drug-smuggling money to 
build the facility, and the government seized his portion of the business. 
Profits from the government's 36% share of the operation have been placed in a 
special U.S. Marshal account now overseen by court-appointed trustee Harry 
Richard. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a court-mandated forfeiture process, the government is preparing to 
auction or sell its share in the club, Richard said, and the casino's employees 
are among interested parties. The city, which receives more than half its tax 
revenue from the casino, licenses the club and has final say over any change in 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 1, with Councilwoman Maria Chacon abstaining, to 
approve the employees' plan. Councilman Rodolfo (Rudy) Garcia voted against the 
proposal. He and Chacon said they wanted more time to review it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all for anything that's going to help a working man get a retirement 
plan," Garcia said. "The only thing I'm against is that they haven't been able 
to give me any numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite initial support from the majority of council members, casino employees 
face a financial challenge, Saborsky said. They must come up with an estimated 
$35 million to pay for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take creative financing," Saborsky said. "It's not going to be 
easy. It may not happen at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, under a strict reading of gaming laws, each participating 
employee would need to register as a casino partner, which would cost about 
$500 per employee, Saborsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual acquisition of the government's stake could take months, Saborsky said. 
Workers will first place a bid for the federal government's share of the club. 
If the bid is accepted, a corporation will be formed. The new company would 
create an employee stock ownership plan and seek loans to help it purchase the 
government's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Saborsky is seeking third-party financing and the workers may return to the 
redevelopment agency to request that bonds be issued to help them purchase the 
casino, which is in a designated redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has the right to issue bonds to help individuals acquire or improve 
property if the project "helps to implement the redevelopment plan," said City 
Atty. Michael Estrada. But, he added, the city "would rather not do any 
financing and we really hope they don't need it." MARY HELEN BERG

 A decade after several city commissions were disbanded for lack of interest, 
the City Council plans to revive panels to give advice on parks, public safety

 Council members John Lyon and Timothy J. Kelemen said they plan to recommend 
at the June 13 council meeting that three five-member commissions be created.A 
public safety commission to consider issues ranging from crosswalk placement to 
graffiti problems would be established first, Lyon said.

 The commissions could cost the city as much as $35,000 a year in materials, 
staff time and commissioners' stipends of $25 per meeting, according to a 
report by City Manager Paul J. Philips. But Kelemen said he hopes to avoid the 
stipends and trim overtime charges by shifting the schedules of city employees 
who would attend commission meetings. GREG MILLER

2 CHALLENGE 2 INCUMBENTS IN LOW-BUDGET DOWNEY COUNCIL CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two incumbents and two challengers are vying for seats Tuesday on the Downey 
City Council in a low-volume, low-budget campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The challengers have scraped together about $1,000 each, and the incumbents 
are spending fractions of what they poured into previous campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 4, Robert S. Brazelton, a 64-year-old local business attorney, is 
seeking a second term against challenger Robert Feliciano, 53, a law 
enforcement consultant who ran unsuccessfully for Los Angeles County Sheriff in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 2, incumbent Barbara J. Riley, 62, a substitute schoolteacher, 
faces Patrick McDermott, 68, a retired elementary school custodian who lost a 
1991 bid for a seat on the Downey school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time it's a lot more do-it-yourself type stuff," said Brazelton, who 
collected $6,700 through May 21. Brazelton was considered a big spender four 
years ago when he raised $17,500. He and Riley used political consultants in 
previous elections but are managing their own campaigns in this race. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley has raised $2,500. She had collected $3,800 in 1992, when she was 
elected to complete the term of a council member who resigned. Feliciano 
collected $900 through May 21, though he said he expected to spend about $3,000 
by Election Day. McDermott said Tuesday he had not formed a campaign committee 
and that he would spend less than $1,000 on the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The low budgets have contributed to what Brazelton called a "lower-key" race, 
but the restrained tone of the election also reflects the personalities of the 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Both incumbents said they don't like to campaign. Challenger McDermott also 
has run a quiet campaign, partly because of unanticipated obligations -- he 
missed a debate while attending a funeral in New Jersey -- and partly by 
design. He refuses, for example, to take the podium at council meetings, where 
candidates routinely grandstand in front of cable-television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Feliciano declined even to pay $400 to have a campaign statement placed on the 
ballot. Still, Feliciano has emerged as perhaps the most energetic and 
outspoken candidate, and has been the source of the few sparks in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In several debates, Feliciano has argued that the city has hired only five new 
police officers, 11 short of the number city officials promised when a 3% tax 
on telephone, gas and electric bills was implemented in October 1990. Further, 
Feliciano has said he would seek to reorganize the force, and increase the 
number of officers patrolling the streets by eliminating all three captain 
positions in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazelton has insisted the city did hire 16 new officers and chastised 
Feliciano for suggesting the council should meddle with the city's police 
force. "I don't want anybody trying to micro-manage the department," Brazelton 
said in an interview. "We have a very good police chief." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Gerald M. Caton said the city has added 19 new officers and now 
employs 121. Caton said Feliciano was comparing the current size of the force 
with the number of positions budgeted -- 116 -- in 1990. The city was unable to 
fill 14 of those positions because of budget cuts, Caton said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four candidates agree the city needs to attract new businesses, and the 
challengers have criticized the incumbents for allowing a movie-theater 
development to be defeated in a citywide vote in May, 1993. Feliciano and 
McDermott have suggested that their opponents could have made better use of 
their positions as city leaders to sell the theater project to voters. "If (the 
council) had done a proper selling job, we would have a theater now," McDermott 
said in a recent debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how we could have marketed it differently," said Riley, adding 
that the city is still searching for ways to bring a theater to the city.

LOW BUDGET FOR CAMPAIGN FUNDING PLAN; LONG BEACH: NEITHER SIDE IS SPENDING MUCH 
MONEY ON PROPOSITION M, WHICH WOULD REFORM ELECTION EXPENDITURES FOR CITY 
OFFICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The effort to reform financing of campaigns for city offices in Long Beach -- 
known as Proposition M, on the ballot Tuesday -- may be one of the 
lowest-budget revolutions to hit town. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the measure say they have little cash to throw into the campaign 
and plan to rely on leaflets and volunteers canvassing neighborhoods this 
weekend to put out the word. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, mainly Councilmen Jeffrey A. Kellogg and Les Robbins, are doing 
even less. They are spending about $50 on a few hundred flyers bearing a 
cartoon showing politicians lined up at a "general fund" spigot to receive 
public funds for campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by a majority of voters, the measure will establish voluntary 
limits on campaign spending and fund raising and will offer matching funds to 
candidates who qualify. The program would cost taxpayers about $1 million every 
four years, officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will be asked to contribute to a "clean government fund" that will 
provide matching funds to eligible candidates. The requests will be included in 
utility bills. If the contributions fall short, the city will draw on the 
general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 According to estimates from City Auditor Gary L. Burroughs, the city would 
need about $228,000 a year to offer matching funds to all candidates in a 
four-year election cycle. The fund would also pay for a full-time administrator 
from the City Clerk's office to oversee the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates who accept matching funds would also agree to spending limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral candidates could spend no more than $200,000 in the primary and 
$100,000 in a runoff -- about half of the record $580,000 that Mayor Ernie Kell 
spent to win reelection in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for city attorney, auditor or prosecutor would face a primary 
ceiling of $100,000 and a runoff limit of $50,000. The limit on City Council 
hopefuls would be $40,000 in the primary and $20,000 in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would reward candidates who reach out to a network of contributors 
rather than rely on a few wealthy supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for matching funds, mayoral candidates would have to raise $20,000 
in amounts of $500 or less. Candidates for city attorney, auditor or prosecutor 
would be required to raise $10,000 in contributions of $350 or less. Public 
funds would only be offered to City Council candidates who raised $5,000 in 
amounts of $250 or less per contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Any candidate who agreed to participate, then exceeded spending limits, could 
be charged with a misdemeanor carrying a fine of up to $500 and a sentence of 
up to six months in jail. The city also would reserve the right to sue 
violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters and opponents say getting people educated on the issue is an uphill 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very important issue but not a very sexy one," said Paul C. Schmidt, 
political science professor at Cal State Long Beach and proponent of campaign 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg, an opponent, said: "You've got a mayoral race and councilmanic races, 
so all the (voter) interest is diverted into other campaigns."

2 LATINAS IN STRONG RUN FOR THE CITY COUNCIL; POLITICS: JENNY OROPEZA, IN 
PARTICULAR -- WHO IS THE FAVORITE -- MIGHT BRING THE FIRST LATINO PRESENCE TO 
THE PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two candidates are waging spirited campaigns to become the first Latinos 
elected to the Long Beach City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Oropeza is the favorite in her council race, and Tonia Reyes Uranga has 
built up the largest campaign war chest of any council candidate in Tuesday's 
elections.  
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza, 36, gave up her seat on the Long Beach School Board to run for the 
council. She is considered a strong favorite to win in the 1st Council 
District, which includes downtown neighborhoods and was redrawn four years ago 
to include a Latino majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza earned 48% of the primary vote in April, just short of the majority 
needed to capture the seat outright. Her opponent, retail consultant Dianne 
McNinch, captured 27% of the primary vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga made the runoff contest in the 7th District and has raised more money 
than any other council candidate. But in the April vote she trailed Mike 
Donelon, a general contractor, in the race for the seat vacated by mayoral 
candidate Ray Grabinski. Donelon earned 43% of the primary votes to Uranga's 
38%. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga and Oropeza have downplayed the issue of ethnicity during their 
campaigns, focusing instead on their qualifications as community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 9th District, 12-year Councilman Warren Harwood is facing an uphill 
climb after finishing second in the April primary. Harwood has been branded a 
maverick who has alienated council colleagues by frequently casting the lone 
dissenting vote. First-time candidate Jerry Shultz, a sheriff's deputy, 
finished ahead of Harwood in a seven-candidate field with 34% of the vote. 
Harwood finished second with 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the nine council seats were on the April ballot. Incumbents Douglas S. 
Drummond in the 3rd District and Les Robbins in the 5th District received more 
than 50% of the votes and were reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 In the remaining three races, the top two vote-getters from each race were 
forced into runoff elections next week. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the races by district: DISTRICT 1: 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza, the first Latino elected to the school board, is making a 
well-financed bid to achieve a similar feat on the City Council. Oropeza has 
raised $40,000, more than double the amount of her opponent, McNinch. 
</P>
<P>
 McNinch, 50, emphasizes her 18 years of community service and business 
background. She has chaired the Neighborhood Improvement Strategy, where she 
helped organize tree-plantings, graffiti cleanups and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza, who has the support of several current members of the council and 
school board, touts her school board experience. Cutting the school district's 
budget for the past several years, she said, has given her the skills to deal 
with the city's shrinking budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of violent crime has topped the candidates' agendas during the 
campaign. In one televised debate, McNinch lifted a hypodermic needle, matches 
and a crumpled paper bag to the camera -- drug paraphernalia that she said was 
in her car after it was vandalized near Drake Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Transient addicts have taken over that park," she said. "It's time to put a 
stop to it." 
</P>
<P>
 She proposes adding about 250 police officers, funded through federal grants. 
Oropeza said she would add 100 officers by cutting city spending in other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Both emphasized the need for community-based policing and early intervention, 
through jobs and recreational programs, to turn youths away from gangs. 
DISTRICT 7: 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon, president of the California Heights Neighborhood Assn., and Uranga, 
the former president of the Long Beach Children's Museum, are political 
newcomers who enjoy broad community support in the district, which covers 
central and western Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 With a campaign war chest of more than $47,000, Uranga has raised more than 
any council candidate. Donelon has raised nearly $31,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more police are needed on the streets, both candidates say, the 
long-term solution to crime is a revitalized economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon, 42, said his experiences as a self-employed general contractor have 
prepared him to make Long Beach more friendly to businesses. He said he would 
consult with business owners and explore ways to make the city's permit system 
more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 He proposes adding 100 officers to the police force but favors a gradual 
increase that would coincide with economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga, 40, said her top priority would be to bring a police substation to the 
city's west side. She said that the Long Beach Airport is an under-utilized 
resource, and that she would support boosting the number of flights there. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga said she will seek to implement an internship program for young people 
at City Hall. DISTRICT 9: 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Shultz, a first-time candidate, finished ahead of seven 
others vying to represent the North Long Beach district. 
</P>
<P>
 In political mailings and debates, Shultz, 47, has cited his law-enforcement 
experience as a qualification to help him reverse trends that he said accompany 
a rise in crime, such as absentee landlords, graffiti and falling property 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need new leadership and enthusiasm that hasn't been seen in North Long 
Beach in over a decade," Shultz said. He has proposed adding 100 to 150 
officers to the police force, which he would like to see supplemented with 
reserve officers and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood, 54, says voters will not hold him responsible for problems caused by 
the state's recession. A projects coordinator for the County Department of 
Health Services and the second-most-senior member of the council, he cites his 
12 years' experience as a qualification. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of his opponent, Harwood said, "It's not the best of times for 
on-the-job training." 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood disputes Shultz's portrayal of him as having alienated his council 
colleagues, saying instead that he is an independent thinker and the conscience 
of the council. As an example, Harwood cited his 1992 efforts to keep the Queen 
Mary in Long Beach over the objections of Mayor Ernie Kell and various other 
city officials.  
</P>
<P>
 "The (ship) is there today, with 500 jobs," Harwood said. "I've got political 
bruises and scars to show for it, but I'm proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood said he would propose spending cuts in areas such as funding for the 
arts to bring the police force to 1,000 officers by 1996, an increase of 208.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; OWNER OF CEMETERY TAPPED FUND, STATE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of Sunnyside Cemetery in Long Beach apparently used money from the 
graveyard's endowment fund to pay such personal expenses as leasing a Mercedes, 
buying food and drinks at local bars and restaurants, and making payments to 
his former wife, according to state investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Giunta, executive director of the state Cemetery Board, said last week 
that officials will seek criminal charges against owner Dean A. Dempsey, and 
his former wife, Debra Dempsey. Authorities suspect the owner of 
misappropriating more than $500,000 from the graveyard's endowment fund, Giunta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey could not be reached for comment, but in a recent interview he denied 
wrongdoing and said he used the money for cemetery expenses. Debra Dempsey also 
could not be reached.  
</P>
<P>
 The 13-acre graveyard, where some of Long Beach's most prominent historical 
figures are buried, has recently fallen into disrepair. Dempsey said he has 
terminal lung cancer, and has been unable to keep up the grounds. State 
officials received complaints about the site, and found the endowment fund's 
balance, which is supposed to remain intact, had dropped from more than $1 
million to about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey, 42, could face felony charges of grand theft, Giunta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Cemetery Board's findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * About $54,000 was withdrawn from the endowment fund for a crematory that was 
never built. An additional $30,000 was taken for an irrigation system that was 
never installed, Giunta said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dempsey paid his former wife nearly $50,000 in salary during 1993, although 
she was not working for Sunnyside, Giunta said. 
</P>
<P>
 * At least $30,000 from the fund was used to make payments on Dempsey's leased 
Mercedes. The car was repossessed last year because of delinquent payments, 
Giunta said. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the past several years, Dempsey used between $2,000 and $2,500 a month 
from the fund to buy food and drinks at local bars and restaurants he 
frequents, Giunta said.

 Teacher sickouts at Compton schools have angered some parents and forced 
district officials to scramble for substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The sickouts, which involved dozens of instructors in at least three schools, 
were not sanctioned by the teachers union, and district officials said they 
were mystified about why teachers are upset. 
</P>
<P>
 The sickouts have taken place intermittently over the last three weeks at 
Dominguez High School, Roosevelt Middle School and Willowbrook Middle School, 
district spokeswoman Arianna Barrios said. On one day, more than 20 teachers 
called in sick at Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen Compton parents picketed Tuesday in front of the teachers union office 
in Compton to protest the job action. Kalem Aquil, a parent who organized the 
demonstration, said he is fed up with district teachers who fail to report to 
work. "Our children aren't being educated," Aquil said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, individual teachers and union officials have complained about 
a 3% pay cut for teachers and about new long-term contracts given to district 
officials. Some teachers also are unhappy about which administrators have been 
appointed to oversee schools. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; SERVICES HELD FOR EX-SCHOOL OFFICIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Services were recently held for Manuel Correa, a retired city police commander 
and the first Latino school board member of the Compton district. Correa, 70, 
died May 22 of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 A 47-year resident of Compton, Correa served on local school boards for 30 
years and was one of the most influential Latinos in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Correa was appointed to what was then called the Compton Union High School 
District board in 1963 and was then elected to the position in 1965. In 1969, 
he was appointed a board member of the new Compton Unified School District, 
which was formed from four smaller districts. Correa was reelected five times. 
</P>
<P>
 He was known in the community for his accessibility and his efforts to counsel 
troubled youngsters. He frequently took teen-agers to baseball and basketball 
games and encouraged them to work hard in school. Correa also regularly spoke 
at schools to warn students against gangs and drugs. In the early 1980s, he 
opened an Alameda Street youth center, where youngsters learned boxing and 
gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 Correa later came under fire for supporting the administrators in charge of 
the financially and academically struggling school district. Some parents and 
Latino activists grew dissatisfied with Correa for his unwillingness to 
criticize district management over virtually any issue, including alleged 
discrimination against Latino employees and students. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I believe he did his best," said Pedro Pallan, an activist and 
businessman. "He was one Latino among seven board members and the majority 
always wins. It's a hard job and I really think the man did a lot for the 
Latino community just by being there." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Guadalajara, Correa came to Los Angeles in 1928 at age 4, later moved 
to Compton and joined the city police department in 1953. He moved up the 
ranks, and served as acting chief twice. He retired in 1985 as a commander -- 
the first Latino to reach that rank. The city subsequently named a walkway next 
to the police station after him. 
</P>
<P>
 Correa had a massive heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery in 1985, just 
after he left the police department. He nevertheless ran for reelection on the 
school board that year. His heart problems flared up again several years later 
and he was frequently absent from board meetings in 1992 and 1993, the year he 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 He died at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, where he had been 
hospitalized since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Correa is survived by his wife, Mary; son, Daniel; daughters Lauren, Claudia, 
Camille and Rossana Preciado; mother, Maria Moreno; brothers, Fred and Louie; 
12 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. JOHN D. WAGNER

 Beverly O'Neill: We need to have the Information Age style of leadership where 
we share information, work cooperatively and try to bring people together. I'm 
talking about coalitions, partnerships and consensus. My style of management is 
one of working through people for the best ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The style that I've seen happening in the past is the "industrial-era" style 
of management, which is authority figures pointing fingers, guarding 
information, working competitively. The style needs to change so that people 
start to develop confidence in the decisions that are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What would be your top priority in your first year as mayor? 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski: I think establishing a clear public safety program is at the top of 
the list. The public safety program I'm talking about is not just law 
enforcement, but laying out a rather extensive prevention program incorporating 
all the neighborhood groups and associations as part of a community congress 
(that would) help form the public safety agenda for the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill: I think we have to address the escalating crime problem we have and 
show that we are making some headway. Even though some of the minor crimes went 
down in number last year, the murder rate was the highest it's ever been in 
Long Beach. It's just not an acceptable direction for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are more police officers the answer to crime?  
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski: Police are the simple solution to a lot of people's perception of 
crime. And  
</P>
<P>
 police are the first to tell you that unless you start looking at the roots 
and causes of crime, you can't hire enough police officers. If more cops were 
the equation to solving the crime problem, then Washington, D.C., would be the 
safest place on the planet. They have four cops per 1,000 (people). We've got 
1.8. But we do need, continually, to add more officers as the community's needs 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to pay for them is to tighten down on what we have now. We need 
to be more creative on how we do governmental business. There is no simple fix. 
I don't think the public will support more taxes, even though they support the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill: More police will not stop crime but will be a deterrent, especially 
if they are visible. Community-based policing seems to be the beginning of an 
answer: You actually know the police in your communities. If our long-term 
objectives are more visible police, the money has to come out of the existing 
budget and by raising our tax revenue base. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now we are at 1.8 police per thousand (residents), which is a small 
ratio compared with Los Angeles. I am proposing we get to at least 2.1 or 2.2, 
which would be around 150 more visible on-the-street officers over three years. 
I'm talking about making sure we have civilianized as many positions within the 
department as we can so that more (officers) are out on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you think the mayor needs more power?  
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski: I think this whole issue is overrated. The mayor has influence. 
Whether or not the mayor has a vote, that doesn't make the office that much 
more successful. What's important is that the mayor can pick up his phone and 
call the President of the United States, call senators, call people who are 
experts in their fields. 
</P>
<P>
 I voted against the last proposal (to give the mayor a vote on the City 
Council) because they were trying to rush it through. But I do support a 
mayoral vote, so long as the number of council members is changed to eight or 
10, plus the mayor. That's for the people to decide.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill: I think the mayor should have a (council) vote, if only for 
accountability. However, I think there is a great deal of power in the mayor's 
position just because you are the chief spokesperson for the city of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor should depend on coalitions to be effective. I think that has been 
lost -- building coalitions within the council so that people learn to give and 
take, to compromise and to understand how we have strength if we are working 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How would you improve the city's business climate? 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski: The first thing that needs to be established is a business council 
. . . made up of business people picked by the council and mayor. That council 
would not only talk about what we need to change right now, but also how we 
shape our regulations. We would be looking to develop rules and regulations 
that don't hinder business, but don't give away the store at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to go on the record as being someone who is more worried about existing 
businesses than new businesses coming to Long Beach. It is absolutely critical 
that businesses here now know they are the No. 1 priority. My commitment to 
small business is primary. We take care of big business, like most cities do, 
but we do an absolute poor job of reaching out and making small business feel 
we're part of their team. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill: I would be the most visible person marketing the city. If I knew of a 
business in Arizona or Texas that was looking to relocate in Southern 
California, I'd be there trying to get them here. We have probably five to six  
</P>
<P>
 different groups marketing the city -- (among them) the Convention & Visitors 
Council, the Chamber of Commerce. I don't think there's been coordination of 
the groups. We need to have a comprehensive plan of exactly what we need for 
the different areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 We also need a different attitude in dealing with existing businesses, so that 
we are friendly to them from the counter level up. I would propose streamlining 
the permit process. Businesses feel neglected. They have not received 
encouragement or consistent answers (at City Hall). We have let businesses go 
that should still be in Long Beach. DUKE HELFAND and EMILY ADAMS

COVER STORY; WHICH WAY LONG BEACH?; MAYOR'S RACE IS A STUDY IN CONTRASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Long Beach voters pull the curtain shut and confront their mayoral 
choices next Tuesday, their decisions could hinge on a matter of style. 
Unquestionably, the two candidates offer a distinct contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly O'Neill is the genteel academic, a former community college president 
known for employing a personal touch to win over critics and forge coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Ray Grabinski is the blunt, blue-collar politician praised by 
supporters for his straight talk and unflagging energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both claim to be exactly what Long Beach needs as it weaves through an urban 
minefield of racial tension, shrinking revenues and a changing self-image. 
</P>
<P>
 At forums across town, each candidate has returned time and again to the 
issues raised by voters: crime and the city's troubled economy, which has been 
hit hard by shrinking defense and aerospace industries. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill promises to add 150 police officers over three years, saying they are 
necessary to quell crime and residents' fears. Grabinski focuses instead on the 
need for gang prevention programs and after-school recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski says existing businesses are his first concern; O'Neill talks of 
wooing out-of-state corporations to town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although they have positioned themselves differently on the issues, they do 
agree on one thing: Long Beach government needs a fresh approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old O'Neill, who is making her first bid for elected office and 
garnered the highest number of votes among 13 candidates in the April primary, 
talks of breaking away from "policies mired in the past." She paints Grabinski 
as part of a sleepy government that has failed to address the city's pressing 
crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opponent has been a member of the City Council for eight years," she said 
during a recent forum. "Crime has increased in the last eight years. And there 
haven't been substantial recommendations forwarded to deter this violence. We 
need a direction, new leadership. We need new answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski, 50, brushes aside suggestions that eight years on the City Council 
have made him an insider, and he attempts to portray himself as the true 
outside candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am one of the merchants of change. I think the Old Guard sees me as a 
threat," he said. "(O'Neill) is more of an insider than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster his argument, Grabinski points to his political origins. He came to 
elective office from the California Heights Action Group, which he co-founded 
14 years ago to fight a proposed oil refinery about a mile west of Long Beach 
Municipal Airport. He says his grass-roots work made him independent of the 
elite insider power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "My independence can look like stubbornness or something else, but I don't 
have to call anyone to find out how to vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a delicate dance that Grabinski does, presenting himself as both an 
outsider and a well-connected man of experience. His contacts on county and 
state levels -- gained mostly through his seven years on the now-defunct Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission -- are necessary for a mayor, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But raising his ties to the transportation commission also has political 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski points to the Long Beach-to-Los Angeles Blue Line as a gleaming 
success. Yet during his tenure, the commission also faced turmoil surrounding 
the Norwalk-to-El Segundo Green Line. The light rail project suffered costly 
delays and has yet to open because the transportation board waffled when 
choosing a contractor to build the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to criticisms of the commission, Grabinski contends that problems 
with the Green Line project were caused by traditional insider politics -- the 
result of officials from Los Angeles, the county and state pressuring the board 
to choose different contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski's supporters hail his unflagging energy on the city's most pressing 
issues. For example, during last summer's effort to save the Long Beach Naval 
Shipyard from closing, Grabinski was a vocal presence at almost every community 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski also counts himself at front of the effort to solve the city's 
violent gang problem and says he was the first city official, in 1986, to call 
for a citywide response. While on the council, he also pressed for more police 
and helped organize new Neighborhood Watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sees what needs to be done and goes out and does it," said Dave Denevan, 
who co-founded the California Heights group with Grabinski in 1980. "He takes 
on a lot, but he's got big shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Although O'Neill does not have any connection to elective politics, she has no 
shortage of connections to civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 During her 31 years at Long Beach City College -- where she went from music 
instructor to college president -- she helped establish a fund-raising 
foundation that taps prominent citizens for scholarships and grants. Over the 
past 16 years, the foundation has raised more than $14 million. She also 
instituted monthly meetings and campus tours for business executives, Navy 
officials and top city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether she meant to or not, Beverly O'Neill has laid the groundwork for 
political office," said Paul Schmidt, a political science professor at Cal 
State Long Beach. "She is well-known among people in Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether O'Neill's lack of experience in city government will 
hurt her. Supporters say she comes to the job well-prepared, with polished 
administrative skills earned while overseeing a $62-million budget, 30,000 
students and 1,300 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "My service to the community has been my entire career," she said. "There 
isn't anything that prepares for mayor as well as the position I have just 
held." 
</P>
<P>
 It is on this point -- her experience -- that Grabinski and his supporters 
level their most frequent attacks against O'Neill. Describing City Hall as a 
labyrinth of intrigues and competing political interests, they question whether 
a newcomer could effectively deal with nine council members, a budget of almost 
$400 million, redevelopment, crime and the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy to come down here without any background and step into the role 
of a leader," said Councilman Thomas J. Clark, who has endorsed Grabinski. "It 
does take a while to fill in that void." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences, O'Neill and Grabinski come from similarly modest 
beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski was raised on Chicago's South Side and in Oakland, Compton and North 
Long Beach. He started working early, with his own pool-cleaning business at 
age 14. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill grew up not far from her current campaign headquarters on East Anaheim 
Street. Injuries to her father during World War I left her mother as the family 
breadwinner, and O'Neill worked her way through high school as a department 
store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 But here their histories diverge. Grabinski never finished college, instead 
becoming an Army sergeant; O'Neill studied music and art in Vienna. She earned 
a master's degree in counseling and a doctorate in education. She is married to 
a retired professor and has one grown daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski, who sometimes still refers to himself as "the pizza man," owned 
three Long Beach restaurants (one pizza parlor, two delicatessens) over 17 
years. The last deli was closed four years after he was elected to the council 
in 1986 -- two years after his wife died of cancer. He has four adult sons. 
</P>
<P>
 From community activist to councilman, Grabinski developed a reputation as a 
man of the people, a street fighter on the issues he cares about. On the 
council, he is known for having a firm grasp of the issues and for a tendency, 
which he readily admits, to lengthy speechmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm pretty simple," Grabinski said. "I'm not any kind of 
intellectual. I'm goal-oriented and a hard worker. I don't usually take no for 
an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, on the other hand, is described by many former employees as an 
administrator with a velvet touch. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill calls herself a coalition builder and says her strength lies in her 
ability to bring competing factions together. Several administrators and 
teachers at Long Beach City College say O'Neill helped usher in an era of unity 
on campus when she took over as president in 1988 -- especially after expanding 
a council that brought together leaders of the school's employee unions, 
students and administrators to discuss problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most important, she was a visible president, often showing up at 
student plays and concerts -- a dramatic change from her predecessors, who were 
often accused of being aloof. O'Neill was known to attend faculty baby showers 
and to send flowers to those who had suffered a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was revered at this school," said Bob Kariger, a former vice president of 
academic affairs. "She was about as close as a president could be to being on a 
pedestal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some political observers say the O'Neill-Grabinski race could come down to an 
east side versus west side contest. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, who lives on the Alamitos Bay peninsula, captured east side districts 
in the primary, whereas Grabinski, a central Long Beach resident, won over the 
western and northern parts of the city. If the same holds true on Tuesday, 
O'Neill might have the advantage because there are more registered voters in 
the city's wealthier east side districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were the top vote-getters in the April primary. O'Neill captured 23% 
of the vote while Grabinski garnered 21%. The winner will replace Ernie Kell, 
who has been the only mayor since Long Beach voters made the job a full-time 
elected position in 1988. Kell finished fifth in April. He has not endorsed a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Former candidate Frank Colonna, a Belmont Shore businessman who placed a close 
third in the primary, has backed O'Neill. For his part, Grabinski has the 
support of the police officers union. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political insiders predict that O'Neill may have an edge because voters 
are weary of incumbents. But most observers say the race is still too close to 
call, and that it could remain that way into election night.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: HOUSE OF KABAB HOME TO AUTHENTIC ARMENIAN DISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Montebello is home to more than 5,000 residents of Armenian descent but only 
one Armenian restaurant. "One is enough," jests Ohannes Loussararian, owner of 
that restaurant, the House of Kabab. "It just means more business for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Alexandria, Egypt, Loussararian planned a career as a hotelier; he 
went to Switzerland and studied at the famed hotel school in Lausanne. When he 
arrived in Los Angeles in 1967, his plans were still intact, but he was 
persuaded to enter the catering business, then dominated by Armenians. After 10 
lucrative catering years, he bought the restaurant that had been known as 
Sibian's, changing the name and little else. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Kabab is simply decorated, highlighted by a few chandeliers and 
mirrors. The tables are set around an open space used as a dance floor during 
banquets, or even during regular dinner hours, whenever one of the customers is 
moved by the Middle Eastern rhythms that reverberate through the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the name of the restaurant, the menu is not dominated by kebabs. In 
fact, there are only three: shish kebab ($12.25), grilled chunks from the leg 
of lamb; lule kebab ($11.60), or ground lamb; and shish tavuk ($12.25), a 
boneless, skinless chicken breast. 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight of the menu is the lamb shank ($13.20), seasoned with garlic, 
onion and tomato paste and baked with carrots and celery for four hours. The 
meltingly tender meat is placed on a hillock of rice pilaf enriched by the 
dripping juices of the shank.  
</P>
<P>
 Every entree comes with a bowl of lentil soup and a small sampling of meze 
(appetizers): grape leaves stuffed with rice and onions, string cheese, 
marinated kidney beans and pickled cabbage.  
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, you can get sarma ($6.15) grape leaves stuffed with ground lamb, 
rice and tomato and served warm with a garlic-infused yogurt dipping sauce, or 
a shish kebab sandwich ($5.15) using pita bread. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Kabab is at 2210 W. Whittier Blvd., Montebello. (213) 721-8956. 
Lunch 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Tuesday-Friday; dinner 5 to 9 p.m. Tuesday-Thursday, 
5-9:30 p.m. Friday, 4:30 p.m.-9:30 p.m. Saturday, 1-9 p.m. Sunday. MICHAEL

 His signature turned out to be worth more than Doug DuChateau thought at the 
Queen Mary Open golf tournament at Lakewood Country Club Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 About $5,650 to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 DuChateau shot a final-round 66 to finish with a four-round total of 276. 
DuChateau, however, mistakenly signed his score card which indicated he had 
shot a 67. 
</P>
<P>
 The blunder dropped the Eugene, Ore., resident from a three-way tie for second 
into a tie for third. Brent Geiberger of Palm Springs and Kevin Sutherland of 
Sacramento, who tied for second at 275, won $9,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
 DuChateau received $3,850. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Klassen won the $100,000 tournament, shooting a four-round total 271. 
Jeff Manson of Long Beach shot a six-under par 66 Saturday to finish in a tie 
for fifth. TITLE WAVE 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakewood High baseball team will play top-seeded Fountain Valley for the 
Southern Section Division I title Friday at 7 p.m. at Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Lancers, seeking their first title since 1987, defeated 
Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks, 6-3, in the semifinals Tuesday at Blair Field to 
win their 13th consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood (24-6) had nine hits, including doubles by Andre Camou and Matt 
Dempsey and a triple by Casey Martin. The Lancers, who defeated Mater Dei, 8-5, 
in a quarterfinal game Tuesday, have outscored their opponents, 36-9, in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gahr will try for its first Southern Section title in 11 years against J.W. 
North of Riverside in the Division II championship at 7:30 Saturday night at 
Blair Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Gahr (22-8-1) beat Temecula Valley, 5-4, in the semifinals Tuesday and knocked 
off top-seeded Redondo, 8-0, Friday with the help of George Castillo, who gave 
up only one hit in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Christian softball team rolled to its 20th consecutive victory, 
defeating La Reina, 3-0, on a one-hitter by Susie Shoales to earn a berth in 
the Division IV final against Paraclete at 5:30 p.m. Friday at Mayfair Park. 
EARLY RETURN 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State baseball team came up short in its bid for a fourth 
College World Series berth in six years in the Midwest II regional at Wichita, 
Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (41-19) suffered two losses to Washington, the Pacific 10 
Conference Northern Division runner-up, in the six-team double-elimination 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Long Beach suffered a 10-4 defeat to the No. 5 Huskies in the 
opener Friday, but rebounded with a 16-hit attack in a 16-9 victory over 
Connecticut on Saturday. The 49ers beat Santa Clara, 6-3, on Sunday but were 
eliminated later in the day to Washington, 6-2. ON TRACK 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Poly High girls' track team will try for its third consecutive 
state title Friday and Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackrabbits' 1,600-meter relay team of Aisha Washington, Myeshia Williams, 
Andrea Anderson and Aminah Haddad ran 3 minutes, 42.89 seconds in the Masters 
Meet Friday night at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 The top five finishers in the Masters Meet advance to the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The mark ranks as the second-fastest time in the state this decade. Poly also 
ran the fastest time of 3:42.75 to win at last year's state meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddad and Anderson finished first and second in the 100 in 11.69 and 11.81, 
respectively. Haddad also edged LaKeisha Backus of Long Beach Wilson, 23.45 to 
23.65, to win the 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Backus also combined with Michelle Nelson, Mary Harris and Kinshasa Davis to 
win the 400-meter relay in 46.16, the top qualifying mark of the state's 10 
sectional championship meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Granville of Bell Gardens was not at his best but was still the class 
of the boys' 800 meters, racing to victory in 1:50.76, despite fighting a cold 
that limited his training to jogging during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville didn't match his performance at the Southern Section finals May 21, 
where he set a national sophomore record of 1:48.98. Granville and Telly Moss 
of Temple, Tex., who has run 1:50.87, are the only athletes to crack 1:51. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to qualify for the state and thought it would take a time in 
the low 1:50s," Granville said. "My tonsils and throat were hurting, but I 
didn't use the stigma of using the cold as a setback." 
</P>

PEOPLE: TREASURE HUNTERS FIND GEMS AMID THE ASHES OF DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CARLSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jan Pazzi's diamond wedding ring survived last year's Altadena fire just fine, 
but it took a treasure-hunting hobbyist from Downey to retrieve it from the 
pile of debris that was once Pazzi's home. 
</P>
<P>
 George Johnson said he and his crew were also able to find most of Pazzi's 
other jewelry, including seven rings and a jumble of gold chains, in the ruins 
of her Kinneloa Canyon Road home during a daylong search one day before Pazzi's 
lot was scheduled to be cleared by a county crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson belongs to the 300-member Prospectors' Club of Southern California. 
Late last year, members of his group and the West Coast Prospectors and 
Treasure Hunters Assn. came forward to filter more than 20 truckloads of ashes 
and debris through the metal screens of their sifters. They hoped to find lost 
treasures for victims of the fires that destroyed hundreds of homes throughout 
Southern California in late October and early November. 
</P>
<P>
 Using skills honed through searches for missing murder weapons for the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department and experience from hours spent combing Old 
West ghost towns, members of both clubs searched about 25 home sites in Laguna 
Beach and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 They recovered more than $20,000 worth of jewelry, including rings set with 
diamonds, rubies and other precious stones. They also found three hand-carved 
Egyptian jade scarabs and a commemorative-coin collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Their rewards for the long hours and the countless cuts from broken glass that 
nick them through their work gloves are the smiling faces of homeowners after 
the prospectors find what they are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he went up to Pazzi with his hand closed, then opened it to 
reveal her ring. "Her scream could have been heard for 10 blocks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work completely for free -- heck, I've driven over 2,000 miles working on 
searches in Laguna and Pasadena -- but her smile made it all worthwhile," said 
Johnson, 68, who retired to do treasure hunting after a 30-year Navy career as 
a boatswain's mate. 
</P>
<P>
 In their searches, the prospectors use sifters measuring 2 feet by 3 feet that 
comprise welded metal frames lined with wire screens to fit over wheelbarrows 
and 35-gallon drums, Johnson said. Ashes and debris are shoveled onto the 
screens. Then the prospectors sort through the material that does not fall into 
the drums and wheelbarrows underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Sproull, who lost her home in Kinneloa Estates, called on the groups to 
find a ruby ring her grandmother had left her and an antique surgical kit that 
belonged to her grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the ring was gone," said Sproull, 35. "Friends had dug through the 
whole area and found nothing. But these people really know what they're doing, 
and (Johnson) found the ring."

PLATINUM SOFTWARE SETTLES LAWSUIT FOR $17 MILLION; COURTS: SHAREHOLDERS WILL 
GET $2 MILLION IN CASH, $15 MILLION IN IOUS. SUIT STEMMED FROM O.C. FIRM'S 
OVERSTATED REVENUE. 
</P>

<P>
 Platinum Software Corp., the accounting software company whose bookkeeping 
practices got it into legal trouble, said Wednesday it has agreed to settle a 
class-action shareholder lawsuit for $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Platinum would pay $2 million in cash and issue $15 
million in corporate IOUs. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by U.S. District Judge Alicemarie Stotler in Santa Ana, the 
settlement would end a period of tumult that began when a group of Platinum 
shareholders filed suit in January, alleging that the company violated 
securities regulations. The suit prompted an internal accounting review. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the company acknowledged that it had overstated its revenue for the 
previous 18 months, prompting four top executives, including founder Gerald R. 
Blackie, to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Carmelo Santoro, a board member who became chief executive, said the 
crisis had forced the company to take a $15-million restructuring charge. It 
also lowered previous revenue reports by $17 million and announced plans to 
shed about a third of its 825 employees through layoffs and spinoffs of various 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 The company still faces an investigation by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, said Bruce C. Edwards, a Platinum board member who acted as chief 
financial officer during the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it was important for the company to put the litigation question 
behind us and stay focused on driving the business forward," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Hodges, a San Diego lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said that anyone 
who bought Platinum stock between Oct. 22, 1992, and April 18, 1994, will be 
eligible for a portion of the payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great settlement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Michnoff, an analyst for Prudential Securities Research in New York, 
said the agreement will leave management with more time to devote to returning 
the company to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still have a number of things to take care of," Michnoff said. "I'd say 
this agreement is good in that it doesn't hurt their cash position that much, 
and it's not bad to get this out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said the company had $17 million in cash at the end of the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum's former top officers -- Blackie, Chief Financial Officer Jon 
Erickson and Treasurer Mark Tague -- still face shareholder lawsuits. So do 
Timothy McMullen and Kevin Riegelsberger, who resigned their posts as 
executives but remain employees of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 If the settlement is approved, Platinum will issue $15 million in corporate 
IOUs to shareholders. It would pay $1 million in cash immediately and another 
$1 million in cash within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The IOUs will pay 8% annual interest and will be subject to mandatory 
redemption in three stages on the following schedule: $5 million within nine 
months after final court approval of the settlement, $5 million after 18 
months, and $5 million after 27 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon redemption, the IOUs could be converted to stock, cash or some 
combination of the two at the company's discretion.

CORNING UNIT AGREES TO BUY NICHOLS INSTITUTE; ACQUISITION: IT WILL TAKE OVER 
THE SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO MEDICAL TESTING COMPANY IN A STOCK AND DEBT DEAL VALUED 
AT $325 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nichols Institute, a medical testing company with facilities in 11 states, 
said Wednesday that it is being acquired by a Corning Inc. subsidiary for $13 a 
share, more than double its recent trading price, in a stock and debt deal 
valued at $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts generally praised the deal, which they said would help both companies 
survive in an industry being buffeted by consolidation and government-backed 
efforts at controlling medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Corning, through its Life Sciences unit, would become the largest player in 
the testing lab business over rival SmithKline Beecham. For 1993, Corning's 
combined laboratory services revenues exceeded $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will the acquisition give Corning an instant presence in the West 
Coast market for routine medical testing, but it also provides it with Nichols' 
esoteric testing laboratory in San Juan Capistrano -- one of the most advanced 
in the nation for diagnosing rare diseases and other abnormal medical 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Corning said it plans to pay the equivalent of $13 for each share of Nichols 
stock by issuing about 6.9 million new shares for a total of about $222 
million. In addition, Corning has agreed to assume more than $100 million in 
Nichols debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols stock closed at $12, a gain of $7.19 a share in trading Wednesday on 
the American Stock Exchange. Corning, which is based in Corning, N.Y., closed 
at $32.37, down 50 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is in the best interests of Nichols shareholders and employees," said 
analyst Joseph E. Millsap of the brokerage Morgan Keegan & Co. of Memphis, 
Tenn. "It solves enormous problems in an industry under intense pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols Institute began 23 ago and has grown into a major manufacturer of kits 
that allow doctors and hospitals to perform routine medical tests and a 
provider of regional laboratory services. It has about 3,500 employees, 
including nearly 1,000 at its San Juan Capistrano headquarters. All employees 
are expected to be retained under the acquisition, Nichols and Corning 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The esoteric laboratory staff could grow as Corning increases the number of 
tests it performs at the specialized laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols Chairman Albert L. Nichols said in a telephone interview Wednesday 
that his company, which lost $4.4 million on revenues of $279.6 million last 
year, needed a new direction in light of recent trends in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced the best way we can do that is to merge with Corning Life 
Sciences," said Nichols, who controls about 60% of the voting power of Nichols' 
common shares. Nichols will become chairman emeritus and a board member of 
Corning Life Sciences after the buyout. After hiring an investment banker to 
consider its options, he said, the firm had talked to SmithKline about being 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
 The new chief executive of the Corning Nichols Institute, as it is slated to 
become, is yet to be identified. The acquisition is expected to be completed in 
about 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy H. Thurman, president of Corning Life Sciences in Teterboro, N.J., said 
that Nichols will be a splendid fit and position the unit for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the industry in the future moving into more high technology," said 
Thurman, adding that he considered Nichols undervalued as a takeover 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were trading bare-bones on their earnings. They should have been 
perceived as a great takeover" target, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Corning acquired another laboratory company, Damon Corp., in a deal 
worth about $575 million. Nichols Stock Shock

announcement that it is being acquired by a Corning Inc. subsidiary. Monthly

OFFICIALS SEIZE ASSETS OF INSURANCE BROKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State insurance regulators said Wednesday they have seized the assets of an 
Irvine auto and truck insurance broker that they allege was selling policies 
without a license and channeling the premiums to other unlicensed firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Insurance investigators said they acted last week against KD 
Excess & Surplus Insurance Services and the two companies to which it allegedly 
sent premiums: CFG Insurance Co. and CFG Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 KD Excess also collected premiums for a third insurer, Atlas Insurance Co., 
then diverted the premiums into CFG accounts in Nevada, state regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Insurance said it revoked KD Excess' license last July and 
also barred Atlas from doing business in California. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could be reached for comment Wednesday at KD Excess' Irvine office.

PUBLIC-SECTOR PAY JUDGED COMPETITIVE; COMPENSATION: ONLY AT HIGHEST LEVELS DO 
O.C. GOVERNMENT JOBS LAG PRIVATE INDUSTRY, STUDY FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wages and benefits of public-sector employees in Orange County are comparable 
to those in private industry for lower- and mid-level jobs, according a new 
report, but there is a significant disparity in the executive suites. 
</P>
<P>
 The compensation of government managers and chief executive officers lags by 
thousands of dollars what their private-sector counterparts are paid, according 
to a study prepared for the League of California Cities, Orange County division 
by the Newport Beach office of independent consulting firm Ralph Andersen & 
Associates in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, based on a survey of 52 local employers, Orange County's 31 cities 
and its county government, is likely to be used to evaluate whether more public 
services could be done by private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality of the situation is that there are only so many dollars to go 
around," said Duane K. Munson, personnel director for the city of Newport 
Beach. The study "is going to be a powerful method of determining how our 
resources are being used." 
</P>
<P>
 Munson, one of several local officials who helped prepare the survey, said the 
information will almost certainly be used at future negotiating sessions with 
employee groups to show that public-sector wages are competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the type of information that can be used at the bargaining table to 
show everybody what's going on," Munson said. Unions "need to temper their 
expectations in negotiations with management to protect the jobs they have." 
</P>
<P>
 Local union officials said they were not aware of the report but were 
immediately suspicious of its conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There goes job security and bargaining rights, right out the door," said 
Robert Wilberg, secretary-treasurer of Service Employees International Union 
Local 787. The union represents 550 county custodians, landfill workers, 
mechanics, heavy-equipment operators and public-works employees. "It seems to 
be another attempt at privatizing the work force." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Ericson, president of the 750-member Anaheim Municipal Employees Assn., 
said: "What concerns me is that management people are doing this study. We 
don't make crap. All of our employee classifications are at bottom levels." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials who participated in the study said government workers' pay 
compares favorably in most areas except for management and top-level 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions, which are pervasive in government and less visible in the private 
sector, are credited in the report with keeping entry-level salaries somewhat 
higher for clerical, trade and technical positions in government. However, that 
beginning advantage does not keep pace with the typical private-industry pay 
structure providing for continued advancement in salary, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, government agencies provide only 20% salary growth for employees 
during their careers, while the figure stands at nearly 50% for private 
industry. For a public-sector executive, the report said, that can mean earning 
as much as $4,000 a month less than a person holding a similar position in 
private industry.

FLUOR DANIEL AWARDED 2 CONTRACTS IN CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fluor Daniel Corp. said it has been awarded two contracts for work in western 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The company received a $133-million contract from oil and gas refiner Suncor 
Inc. for engineering, procurement and construction management services to build 
a scrubber unit to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at Suncor's Ft.McMurray, 
Alberta, oil refining plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Fluor Daniel was also awarded a contract by BHP Minerals Canada 
Ltd. to provide engineering services at a diamond mine in the Northwest 
Territories. Fluor Daniel did not disclose the value of that contract, which it 
shares with privately held Signet Engineering Pty. Ltd. of Perth, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The diamond mine, in the remote Lac de Gras region of the Northwest 
Territories, is jointly owned by BHP and Vancouver-based Dia Met Minerals Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Daniel said the mine, accessible for construction only by a winter ice 
road, is North America's first commercial-scale diamond mine.

BROADER CASTING FOR PROFITS; MARKETING: PUBLIC TV, RADIO STATIONS LINK UP WITH 
PROGRAM-RELATED RETAILERS, SUCH AS ONE IN SOUTH COAST PLAZA, FOR A NEW SOURCE 
OF FUNDS. 
</P>

<P>
 Public broadcasting stations that go head-to-head vying for viewers and 
donations now are knocking heads in another arena: shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition is especially hot in Southern California, where two privately 
held retail chains with strong ties to public broadcasters are opening stores 
in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual blend of retailing and broadcasting is resulting in glitzy stores 
that use interactive computers, big-screen televisions, hands-on displays and 
highly trained sales personnel to make sales.  
</P>
<P>
 Store shelves are filled with thousands of instructional, inspirational and 
simply entertaining products -- as well as public broadcasting's requisite tote 
bags, coffee mugs and educational videos. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores appear to be a hit with consumers. One of those is Rebecca Sultan, 
who has been ordering hard-to-find educational material through the mail from 
Learningsmith Inc., a Boston-based retail chain partly owned by that city's 
leading public TV station, WGBH. 
</P>
<P>
 Sultan is now shopping at Learningsmith's 17th location, which opened last 
weekend at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. "I rely upon (Learningsmith) for 
everything I need to teach my children," said Sultan, who is educating her two 
children in her Laguna Hills home. "I'm so glad they opened in Orange County. 
It's just an incredible store." 
</P>
<P>
 Learningsmith, which opened in Beverly Center in April, plans to add a San 
Diego location in October. The Beverly Center and South Coast Plaza stores are 
affiliated with KUSC (91.5 FM), a public radio station owned by USC. The San 
Diego store will not be affiliated with a local station. 
</P>
<P>
 Learningsmith, co-owned by WGBH-TV and a venture capital firm, opened its 
first store in 1992 in Boston. The company also operates stores with WNET-TV in 
New York, WETA-TV in Washington, D.C., and WCNY-TV in Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Learningsmith's major competitor in the fledgling market is Store of 
Knowledge, a Carson-based company partly owned by KCET-TV (Channel 28). KCET's 
partners are the Riordan, Lewis and Haden venture capital firm that counts Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan as a principal; and Lakeshore Learning Inc., a 
Carson-based retailer that generated $90 million in 1993 revenue through its 
six stores and a catalogue business. 
</P>
<P>
 Store of Knowledge opened its first location in Glendale Galleria in November. 
Its second is slated to open in October at Fashion Island in Newport Beach, and 
additional stores are planned in Santa Monica, San Diego and the Inland Empire. 
Store of Knowledge says it hopes eventually to have as many as 100 stores 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcasters say they are entering the retail arena for two reasons. At the 
core, they say, is their mission to foster lifelong learning. They can do that 
more effectively, they say, by helping to make educational books, videos, games 
and toys available. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, broadcasters are counting on the stores to generate profits 
that will help to make up for flagging corporate donations and dwindling 
government funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Learningsmith executives would not discuss their royalty agreements 
with KUSC and other affiliated stations, the company's marketing director, Ken 
Zuckerman, said that "the money can be significant. . . . In some cases, the 
payments can be in excess of six figures annually." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike KUSC, which accepts royalty payments in return for its Learningsmith 
affiliation, KCET has taken an equity stake in Store Of Knowledge. KCET's 
managers say that the station's for-profit partners put up the cash to open 
stores and that the deal will not expose the station to undue financial risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers are betting that their new-found partners will give them an edge 
with viewers and listeners typically better educated and more affluent than the 
general public. "We look at the affiliation as sort of a 'Good Housekeeping 
Seal of Approval,' " Zuckerman said.  
</P>
<P>
 But critics question whether such alliances cross the carefully drawn line 
that separates nonprofit and commercial broadcast stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're engaging in blatant advertising for consumer goods, they're 
cashing in on their credibility and their non-commercial status," said Karen 
Brown, research director for the Washington-based Center for Study of 
Commercialism. "We see it as part of a disturbing trend: the privatization and 
commercialization of private broadcasting." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents counter that retail stores and mail-order catalogues are natural 
alternatives for cash-strapped station managers who are scrambling to cover 
shortfalls created by a dwindling number of corporate program sponsors and a 
dearth of government funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is changing, and (public broadcasting is) changing with it," said 
Maria Eitel, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, which is urging affiliated stations to explore stores, catalogues 
and other ways to augment funding shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 As broadcasters and detractors argue, consumers are flocking to stores that 
were designed to keep pace with some of the most successful retailers. 
Learningsmith's South Coast Plaza store, for example, was drawing bigger crowds 
this week than the Disney Store next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Learningsmith describes its outlets as "general stores for the curious mind" 
where "learning specialists" invite customers to test-drive computer programs 
and leaf through books. 
</P>
<P>
 Store of Knowledge boasts that it has "culled the best of the best from 
bookstores, computer stores, video stores and toy stores," said Laura Wynne, 
Store of Knowledge's chief operating officer. "It's almost an emotional 
experience when you enter our store."

US FACILITIES LAWSUIT CHALLENGES ELECTION OF 2 DIRECTORS; INSURANCE: SEATS WERE 
NARROWLY WON BY NOMINEES OF FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, WHICH HAS MADE A 
HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 US Facilities Corp., which shareholders voted last week to put up for sale, 
filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging the election of two directors nominated 
by the company that wants to purchase it. 
</P>
<P>
 US Facilities is asking Chancery Court in Delaware, where it is incorporated, 
to count 80,386 votes that independent tabulators had thrown out. The votes 
would be enough to defeat the nominees of Irvine-based Fidelity National 
Financial Inc., which is offering $79 million in a hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The right to vote those shares at last week's annual meeting had been given on 
the same day both to US Facilities and to Fidelity, prompting tabulators to 
disqualify the shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection of those votes "clearly disenfranchised our employees and 
frustrated their decision to vote for our directors," said George Kadonada, 
chairman of US Facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity disagreed. "In light of the shareholder mandate to get on with the 
process to sell or merge the company, this is a waste of shareholder time and 
money," said Frank P. Willey, a Fidelity executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity overwhelmingly won a shareholder vote on its proposal to put US 
Facilities, an insurance holding company, on the market. But its two candidates 
for board seats won by only 23,808 votes. Kadonada said no board meetings will 
be set until the election challenge is decided. 
</P>
<P>
 In unrelated Wall Street activity, Fidelity's stock price fell nearly 10% 
Wednesday after an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. lowered his projections of 
the company's earnings for this year and next. Fidelity's stock closed 
Wednesday at $14.875 a share, down $1.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 With interest rates higher and the refinancing market nearly gone, Michael R. 
Hughes at Merrill Lynch figured that Fidelity, the nation's fifth-largest title 
insurer, would earn $2.20 a share this year and $2.55 a share next year, down 
from his previous estimates of $2.75 this year and $3.15 next year. For the 
first quarter, Fidelity earned 43 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock beating should not affect Fidelity's effort to buy US Facilities. 
Fidelity has more than $100 million on hand from a February stock sale and 
plans to pay cash for the acquisition, which would diversify its operations.

 SPI Turns to PR: SPI Pharmaceuticals in Costa Mesa said Wednesday it has hired 
public relations agency Edelman Medical Communications of New York to give its 
products higher visibility in the scientific community. In particular, SPI 
said, it wants to promote its leading drug, Virazole. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug -- which is sold in 60 countries for treatment of various illnesses, 
including hepatitis C -- is approved for a single use in the United States: as 
an aerosol to treat infants hospitalized with severe viral respiratory 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN Pharmaceuticals, which owns a substantial stake in SPI, announced recently 
that it will seek federal approval to sell Virazole in this country to treat 
hepatitis C. The disease, which can go undetected for many years, destroys 
liver function.

 Golden West Homes: Facing a cooling market for home-building companies' 
stocks, the company said it will postpone its proposed $14.7-million initial 
public offering for about two months while it considers other potential sources 
of financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County manufactured-housing company said that the Standard & Poor's 
index of home-builder stocks has fallen 15.3% since May 1, while the S&P 500 
Index has risen 1.1% -- a clear indication that investors have soured on 
housing companies in the wake of rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West filed in April to sell 1.8 million shares at $7 to $9 apiece 
through an underwriting group led by Wedbush Morgan Securities. The company 
planned to use proceeds to provide financing for home buyers, repay debt and 
equip a recently purchased factory.
