BOOK REVIEW: STORIES; A QUARTET OF NOTEWORTHY TALES ABOUT SOME ORDINARY PEOPLE; 
THE PALACE THIEF, BY ETHAN CANIN , RANDOM HOUSE; $21, 205 PAGES

<P>
 This collection of four long stories, or short novellas, brings to mind D.H. 
Lawrence's division of American writers into the genteel and the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethan Canin ("Emperor of the Air," "Blue River") is genteel. The pleasures of 
reading him -- and they are considerable -- are the pleasures of restraint, not 
of excess. Canin writes quietly, if tellingly, about ordinary people. He relies 
on the well-chosen detail and the revealing line of dialogue to achieve effects 
for which lesser writers have to pull out a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 At 33, Canin, who is completing his medical residency, is not only intelligent 
but precociously mature. He tells these stories through the minds of people 
older than he is, intuiting experiences he couldn't have had, and it works. 
</P>
<P>
 His prose is clear and graceful and -- whether in the first or the third 
person -- beautifully modulated to fit the main character's personality. 
</P>
<P>
 In each story, the main character too is genteel. Sober, ethical, inhibited, 
at least conventional, he must come to grips -- this is the recurring issue -- 
with somebody close to him who is wilder, stranger or more ruthless than he. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Accountant," the narrator is totting up the ledger of his life. On the 
credit side is a career of steady, if unspectacular, achievement; on the debit 
side is the far greater success of a childhood friend who seemed to rely on 
luck instead of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 The two meet again at a fantasy baseball camp run by the San Francisco Giants. 
The narrator, inspired by the presence of Willie Mays and his own feats on the 
diamond, seems about to balance the books -- until he commits an act that not 
only sabotages his career but puts his whole well-ordered life in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always felt the impulse for uproar and disorder," he realizes -- his 
choice of a spendthrift wife is a clue -- and he wonders if this flaw in his 
character may be "so large that it cannot properly be called a flaw but my 
character itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Character is fate: Canin quotes Heraclitus to that effect, then plays elegant 
variations on the theme. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Batorsag and Szerelem," the younger brother of a troubled math prodigy in 
Ohio asks what his father would say if he too went astray. The father says he 
isn't the type. The boy asks, "What if I changed my character?" and the father 
answers, "You won't. That's the point." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, though, the parents' fate is to always be a step behind. 
Rattled by the upheavals of the early '70s, they abandon Judaism, become 
Quakers, protest the Vietnam War and try to understand when their older son 
smokes pot and has a girlfriend living in the basement -- but they fail to 
recognize the "foreign language" he seems to have invented, or the deeper 
secret that language hides. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The City of Broken Hearts," a Bostonian whose wife has left him for one of 
his colleagues seeks solace in Red Sox games and in visits from his son, a 
serious young man who works at a shelter for battered women. The father has 
been looking for romance in bars; the son introduces him to a more appropriate 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
 He considers marrying her but can't be sure that his fate -- a singular one in 
this time and culture -- isn't to love one woman only: his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 In the title story, Canin echoes the moral concerns of Louis Auchincloss' 1964 
novel, "The Rector of Justin." A history teacher at a Washington, D.C., prep 
school looks back on his failure to civilize the obstreperous son of a Southern 
demagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just that the boy has been corrupted by his inheritance of power 
seeking; the school too has been corrupted by its hunger for money and status, 
and the teacher by his self-deluding idealism. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, Canin has a sure touch with family relationships, and there is a 
bright and generous spirit -- call it a youthfulness -- to his telling of these 
stories that compensates for their formal polish and the rigor of their 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 One is reminded of Philip Roth, who showed a similar verve and the same 
uncanny maturity in his first two books, then got bored with being grown-up and 
embarked on a literary adolescence from which he hasn't returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Canin do the same? Never mind. This is hardly the time to worry about 
him; it's the time to enjoy.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; READY OR NOT FOR PRIME TIME; MICHAEL, JANET JACKSON BRIGHTEN 
A MOSTLY TACKY FAMILY TV TAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LaToya may have had the right idea. Much as you hate to give her too much 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point the loose cannon of the Jackson clan -- who claims she was the 
only one of 30 or so family members not invited to take part in "The Jackson 
Family Honors" show Saturday night -- had considered disguising herself and 
sneaking into the MGM Grand Garden arena here to watch the ballyhooed family 
reunion surreptitiously. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, LaToya and her husband planned to just go down the Strip to catch a 
Tony Bennett show. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the "Honors" taping, more than a few attendees may have wished 
they had followed her lead down the street, since the Bennett gig at least 
promised to be a real concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jacksons reunion, on the other hand, was a mostly dismayingly tacky 
television variety-show taping that would have been better suited to a 
Hollywood sound stage with guests invited in for free instead of booked into an 
arena charging luxury prices (even with the scant justification that some of 
the money was earmarked for charity). The special airs Tuesday on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a TV show. Ain't that a bitch?," carped Desni Scott of Anaheim, one 
of the few paying attendees to dress in a tuxedo. "I've never been so ripped 
off. I could have put that money on the tables. " 
</P>
<P>
 The too-ready-for-prime-time aura was compounded by the presence of 
incongruous guest spots, from such unlikely consorts as singers Bruce Hornsby 
and Celine Dion, plus hoofing routines by the Michael Peters Dancers, who 
go-go'd to Motown medleys in an archaic fashion that made Debbie Allen's worst 
Oscar production numbers look suddenly hip by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, Smokey Robinson and Gladys Knight would step up to front the 
song-and-dance embarrassment. A tune that had Jermaine, Marlon, Rebbie, Tito, 
et al. trotting out their kids also reeked of Ed Sullivan redux .  
</P>
<P>
 So who would play the role of rescuer in this dysfunctional family revue? The 
two most obvious, and obviously reluctant, participants: Janet, who even with a 
perfunctory version of "Alright" outclassed every other performance on the 
show, and Michael, returning to the stage following his celebrated personal 
crises and providing charisma and a sense of climax for the show even without 
singing in it (unless you count his half a verse in the big family finale). 
</P>
<P>
 At a press conference earlier in the day Saturday, the organizers of the show 
(projected as the first of an ongoing series) were already practicing spin 
control on how the advertising had promised a Michael Jackson "performance" 
when there wasn't going to be one. Said one of the show's producers, Emmy 
winner Gary Smith, straight-faced, "Michael's going to be presenting two 
awards. These are clearly 'performances' on his part, as far as he's 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a stretch, but Smith wasn't far wrong. Surprisingly charming, confident 
and un-squirmy for once outside of a music-making mode, Jackson had a job to do 
here, and it wasn't to sing, but to bask -- a state he nearly raised to a level 
of performance art, as everyone else on the telecast and in the crowd conspired 
to make the night a love feast on his beleaguered behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love you too," a beaming Jackson said, again and again, and again, scarcely 
able to get through a scripted sentence of his presentations without having to 
pause to acknowledge the loving hollers of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 There were banners of support scattered through the hall, and his first 
appearance was greeted with a four-minute standing ovation. The crowd was clear 
where its loyalty lay: Jackson was a martyred innocent, miraculously exhumed, 
resurrected and brought back to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The two designated honorees, Elizabeth Taylor and Motown founder Berry Gordy 
Jr., sensing this night wasn't much about them, turned the tables and spent 
most of their acceptance speeches gushing to Michael's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael, we know your recent torture is not going to change your compassion 
and love for children," Taylor told the man who would be King of Pop again. 
"There's beauty and truth in your being. You are the brightest star in the 
universe." 
</P>
<P>
 In the show's most bizarre moment, though, Taylor had to protect her bright 
star from a crowd that started to turn testy. Near the end, the impatient 
audience began to chant for Jackson to perform; when Taylor responded, "I know 
you'd all like to hear Michael sing a song, but he doesn't have any music 
prepared," the cheers suddenly gave way to mass catcalls, prompting Taylor to 
have to rebuke the booers: "Come on, that's not nice! That's an ugly sound." 
</P>
<P>
 From a four-minute standing ovation to a chorus of boos in minutes flat. 
That's America, land of the fickle. 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointing as the absence of a Michael number was, it was hard to blame him 
for waiting for a better context than this to premiere his first major 
post-lawsuit-settlement comeback routine. Whatever and whenever that may be. 
Meanwhile, the really "honorable" thing for the Jackson family would be not to 
force Michael and Janet to have to carry such a superfluous show for them again 
next year.

PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW; SERMON FROM A LOVE PULPIT; TIM MILLER'S 'NAKED BREATH' 
ATTEMPTS TO PURGE PARANOIA AND RESTORE LUST IN THE AGE OF AIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Miller is a patron saint of the gay performance world. He's an evangelist 
on a mission, a priest offering absolution for fear of sex. His "queer body," 
as he calls it, is the sacrament, and our "naked breath" the holy ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's latest work, "Naked Breath," is at Highways in Santa Monica. The solo 
piece emerges from Miller's aesthetic ambition to mirror gay society's cultural 
conflicts while "trying to find an artistic, spiritual and political response 
to the AIDS crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 But after more than two years on the road touring his previous piece, "My 
Queer Body," Miller's return to the theater he co-founded has a messianic tone. 
The cross around his neck, his naked body's crucified poses, the laying on of 
hands with his audience -- all this comes perilously close to hubris. As such, 
"Naked Breath" is more agenda than art, a confessional catechism designed to 
purge paranoia and restore free lust. But moments of genuine catharsis are 
undermined by a meandering focus and wavering shape, resembling the breath 
Miller intones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do it like your life depends on it," Miller declares, breathing rhythmically 
and deeply, "which it does. In and out. Breathe. Breathe out the lie that we 
don't belong together. Breathe in the love. Run naked through the streets of 
L.A. Proclaim the end of sadness. Celebrate the miracle of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing black jeans with a stylish hole in the knee, a red plaid shirt with 
ripped-out sleeves and tennis shoes, Miller moves among the audience, 
commanding patrons to breathe on him. 
</P>
<P>
 During these segments, Miller resembles a New Age sex therapist; Dr. Ruth with 
a lean, mean body championing lust and love. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is divided between stories about his sexual encounters before AIDS, 
and later ones with HIV-positive men. His piece hinges on carpentry, "the one 
place where Dad and I connected. I'm good with wood." 
</P>
<P>
 He specialized in loft beds. "I am a carpenter and I will build beds and I 
will build a place inside myself to honor my journey and the streets I stroll." 
</P>
<P>
 But carpentry is "a blood contract. Accidents happen." After a maiming injury, 
Miller remembers imagining the sky as "a wall of angry blood." 
</P>
<P>
 That 1981 accident ends the first half of "Naked Breath." Then Miller strips 
and an anonymous stagehand bathes his nude body. Arms akimbo, Miller assumes 
the crucified posture of an earlier carpenter. In the background, the late AIDS 
activist Michael Callen sings "They Are Falling All Around Me." 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of "Naked Breath" describes his willing sex with HIV-positive 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm positive," said one lover after their initial encounter. "Just found out. 
How about you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm negative," Miller casually answered, "last time I checked." 
</P>
<P>
 "So what's safe?" Miller asks. "This kiss? I've gotta have it. I get scared. . 
. . Clap. Amoebas. Herpes. Hepatitis. HIV. This fear chews me up for breakfast. 
I've been trying to turn this fear around." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a courageous confession, at times even a compelling one. But then Miller 
disingenuously asks, "Am I being too sentimental right now?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Naked Breath," Highways, 1651 18th Street, Santa Monica. Fridays-Saturdays, 
8:30 p.m. Ends March 19. $12. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MAVERICKS ARE HONKY-TONK-POP-LATIN-ROCK-SOLID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't often see a country nightclub filled with dancers two-stepping their 
way across the floor while the band plays its ode to a generation of Cuban 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mavericks, who did just that Tuesday at In Cahoots, isn't your 
standard-issue country band. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Florida-based quintet is one of the brightest additions to the 
country scene of the '90s. The 90-minute performance made it abundantly clear 
that none of the charms of its two albums were created with recording-studio 
mirrors and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks are doubly blessed with the masterful singing of Raul Malo, who 
also just happens to be a top-notch writer. Malo has a firm grasp of the craft 
behind a great country song, but unlike so many writers plying their trade in 
Nashville today, he never lets formula get in the way of honest emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an almost mathematical symmetry to the structure of verses in 
"Pretend," a song he wrote with veteran country composer Kostas: 
</P>
<P>
 Pretend you're still in love with me  
</P>
<P>
 And things are what they used to be  
</P>
<P>
 I know our love's come to an end  
</P>
<P>
 So one more time let's just pretend  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 It's powerfully simple, as the best country songs are. 
</P>
<P>
 While such a tune proves the Mavericks know classic country and honky-tonk 
inside out ("Pretend" and several others off its new "What a Crying Shame" 
album would be perfect for Buck Owens), the group can deliver stinging social 
commentary as convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Such material was more prevalent on its 1992 major-label debut, notably the 
title song, "From Hell to Paradise." Malo's ode to those, including his own 
parents, who escaped the repressive Castro regime was transformed Tuesday from 
the country-rock anthem treatment on the album to a more apt Latin arrangement. 
Malo strummed a Spanish guitar, bassist Robert Reynolds and drummer Paul Deakin 
emphasized a loping calypso beat while guitarist Nick Kane snaked in spare 
guitar leads and keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden supplied colorful accordion 
fills. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the performance, the musicians brought a Blasters-Los Lobos-style 
roots-rock ethic to their playing, shifting deftly from country and Western 
swing to Tex-Mex, rockabilly and Latin pop to keep the textures varied. And the 
dancers moving. They also displayed a solid foundation in blues structures that 
allowed them to let songs breathe more fully than the recorded versions. 
</P>
<P>
 It was reassuring to see that in concert they didn't back off the 
sociopolitical bent of that first album, even though they've gotten their first 
taste of commercial acceptance with the love song-dominated "Crying Shame" 
album. "Mr. Jones" is a particularly deft rendering of the 
you-can't-go-home-again theme that works as well on small scale as it does in 
the larger view of those who yearn for a return to the "better days" of yore. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's nothing to apologize for about the new album's focus on matters 
of the heart. Several numbers have the ring of future classics. And who knows? 
With modest commercial success of the title single, the Mavericks' are off to a 
good start in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is on a brief California tour that began Tuesday in San Diego and 
brings the band back to Orange County tonight for a show at the Country Rock 
Cafe in Lake Forest.RANDY LEWIS

 Roseanne Stays With ABC: Despite a rift last year between Roseanne Arnold and 
ABC that resulted in the star saying she would take her highly rated series to 
another network at the end of this season, "Roseanne" will continue to air on 
ABC for at least the next three years. The comedian; her husband, Tom Arnold; 
Carsey-Werner Co., the show's producer; and ABC announced the new agreement 
Friday, but information regarding the dollar amount of the deal was not 
available. Roseanne Arnold last year threatened to take her show elsewhere 
because she was fed up with ABC's indecision over whether to renew husband 
Tom's "The Jackie Thomas Show," which was subsequently canceled. The new 
agreement comes even as the Arnolds and the network are engaged in another 
scuffle over Roseanne kissing a woman on an upcoming program. The Arnolds claim 
ABC has balked in showing the kiss in the March 1 episode. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stuff About Pufnstuf: H.R. Pufnstuf, the lovable TV dragon that '70s kids 
will remember, may be making a comeback. A spokesman for TV producers Sid and 
Marty Krofft, also known for the Saturday morning shows "Land of the Lost" and 
"Sigmund and the Sea Monsters," said the pair has a '90s version of their show 
about H. R. Pufnstuf in the works. Spokesman Roger Neal says big names are 
expected to play the characters of the show's villain, Witchiepoo, and the 
young boy who is lost on Living Island, where H. R. is mayor. The original 
show, which began on NBC in 1969 and aired on ABC in 1972, starred Jack Wild 
(the Artful Dodger in the movie "Oliver"). It has been seen around the world in 
syndication since the end of its run. 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS Going for the Gold: CBS' Winter Olympics coverage is not only on a pace 
to set a prime-time Olympics record (winter or summer) but is also helping the 
network set records and rank first in other time periods as well. Its morning 
coverage averaged a 5.7 rating for the first week, marking the first time CBS 
has beaten both ABC and NBC in the morning (7-9 a.m.) time period, according to 
figures released by the A.C. Nielsen Co. "Late Show With David Letterman," 
which has included reports from Lillehammer, Norway, by Letterman's mom, 
averaged a 9.1 rating last week, the show's highest weekly average. Its 
previous best was 8.9 during its premiere week. And the late-night Olympics 
wrap-up averaged a 4.5 rating, as opposed to 1.6 for NBC's "Late Night With 
Conan O'Brien." 
</P>
<P>
 * Daytime at Night: For the first time in its nearly 21-year history, "The 
Young and the Restless," the top-rated daytime soap opera for the past five 
years, will air in prime time. The one-hour installment that will air at 10 
p.m. March 3 was not written for the nighttime date; it is an episode that 
normally would have aired during the day. William J. Bell, the soap's 
co-creator and senior executive producer, says the outing is "a showcase for 
the nighttime audience, so they can see the stories we tell, the excellent 
actors we have, the ensemble feeling, the live-on-tape production." AWARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Hail to Jack: Jack Nicholson will be honored by his peers on "The American 
Film Institute Salute to Jack Nicholson," a special celebrating his extensive 
film career, which airs March 10 on CBS. At the event, the two-time Academy 
Award winner will be joined by Candice Bergen, Danny DeVito, Michael Douglas, 
Faye Dunaway, Jessica Lange, Mike Nichols, Michelle Pfeiffer and Sean Penn, 
among others. The tribute marks AFI's 22nd annual salute to a major figure in 
the film world. Past honorees include Orson Welles, Henry Fonda, Alfred 
Hitchcock, Jimmy Stewart, John Huston, Sidney Poitier and Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 * The People Speak: The presenters for the 20th annual People's Choice Awards 
will include Tim Allen, Carol Burnett, Michael Douglas, Anthony Hopkins, Angela 
Lansbury, Walter Matthau and Janine Turner. Paul Reiser will host the show, 
which airs at 9 p.m. on March 8 from Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. The 
show presents awards to top vote-getters in the categories of TV, film and 
music. QUICK TAKES

 It's no surprise that Lou Reed would volunteer to headline a concert 
championing filmmakers' right to have their work shown as they intend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Los Lobos and Chris Isaak, Reed played Saturday at the Shrine 
Auditorium in a benefit for the Artists Rights Foundation. The organization 
opposes unauthorized tinkering (via colorizing and other technical means) when 
films go into broadcast or video circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among many other things in a sometimes erratic but basically brilliant career, 
Reed has been an ardent lover and chronicler of the artistic impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 One could have placed bets on which songs the New York-based rocker would play 
to reflect the evening's purpose. The foremost candidate was "Doin' the Things 
That We Want To," a memorable salute to artists who revel in their creative 
freedom. In it, Reed, a prime mover of frank and brutal rock since his 1966 
debut with the Velvet Underground, applauds the "frank and brutal movies" of 
director Martin Scorsese. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed didn't play that song, but he lived up to it. His 55-minute set indulged 
his own desire to try something different, even if that meant largely ignoring 
his own songbook, and consequently the expectations of fans hoping to savor old 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 It made for a fresh and hard-charging show as Reed spent most of his 10-song 
program honoring others: Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Pete Townshend, Kurt Weill, 
Victoria Williams and Smokey Robinson. Of course, he and his crisply muscular, 
three-man band put their own spin on those tributes, radically reconstructing 
most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 A suitably twangy, clackety-beat medley of "Mystery Train" and "That's All 
Right" found Reed getting the jump on acknowledging the 40th Anniversary of 
Presley's 1954 recording debut. A long, stormy and sardonic reading of the 
Dylan obscurity "Foot of Pride" reprised Reed's performance of the song at a 
1992 concert marking the 30th anniversary of Dylan's first release. Reed also 
previewed his contribution to an upcoming Pete Townshend concert tribute, 
tearing down "Now and Then," a fervent and winsome love song from Townshend's 
recent album "Psychoderelict," and putting it back together as a light, 
swinging blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing to a house that was far from full, Reed won cheers but also faced a 
dissident faction that voted with its feet or called out for more expected 
fare. He maintained his equanimity and dry sense of humor, and gently explained 
late in the set that "benefits are kind of fun -- you can be a little looser 
and not have to do something you would have to do in an official show." 
</P>
<P>
 With the house lights on, Reed finally rewarded the faithful with an encore of 
"Sweet Jane," not a bad classic to have if he's letting you have just one. The 
crowd loved it, and judging from his playful, swaggering delivery, complete 
with trademark hipster asides ("Watch me now!"), it was all right with him, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Lobos preceded Reed with a a prime performance. Isaak, the opener, looks 
like a movie star, has hopes of becoming one, and was at his best singing 
steamy, sultry songs that sounded like miniature films noir. He was less 
convincing with the rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 David Crosby began the proceedings with a talk that vigorously set out the 
issues addressed by the Artists Rights Foundation. Crosby, whose late father 
Floyd was an Oscar-winning cinematographer, also sang two unrecorded songs: one 
heartfelt and deeply personal, but shapeless and droning; the other, about 
wanting to take in life with the acuity of a camera, was far more focused.

DANCE; A LUSH SAMPLING OF LUBOVITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Master of the lubed move, Lar Lubovitch has built a modern dance career on 
lush, liquid virtuosity. Sampled in two programs at the Wadsworth Theater on 
Friday and Saturday, the flowing sculptural richness of his style often became 
an end in itself, with "Concerto Six Twenty-Two" perhaps the best example. 
</P>
<P>
 Performed Saturday, this 1986 ensemble showpiece to Mozart's clarinet 
composition of the same Kochel number assimilated the innovations in a whole 
Paul Taylor sub-genre -- but coated them in honey and then in powdered sugar. 
You want jaunty, Tayloresque mock-jogging plus creamy, swoop-and-swirl 
Lub-o-vision? Seek no further. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through "622," there occurs the celebrated male duet that Mikhail 
Baryshnikov's White Oak Dance Project included in its first Southland 
performances in 1991. Mercurial, intimate and gymnastically inventive, it made 
a genuine emotional statement that the work's cutesy-poo finale immediately 
retracted. At least Jeffrey Hankinson and Lane Sayles danced with lyric 
sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 In its world premiere on Friday, the suite "So in Love" attempted a shift in 
Lubovitch attack. Here he extrapolated from distinctive vocalism heard on four 
contemporary recordings of Cole Porter songs. Thus Rebecca Rigert was sent 
onstage to sprawl, spit, roll imaginary dice, shake her breasts and give 
everyone The Finger as a gloss on Tom Waits' gritty interpretation of "It's All 
Right With Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lushness, however, immediately reclaimed the stage in a candied duet for Susan 
Shields and Sayles (to the Neville Brothers) full of generalized ice-dancing 
rapture. And, beyond their initial, pantomime psychodrama, Kelly Slough and 
Scott Rink also became swept up in swoony lifts during their duet to Annie 
Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, the long-limbed, spectacularly limber Mia Babalis indulged in 
glamorous self-stroking and hair-lashing to k.d. lang. Yes, the parodistic 
narcissism of the dancing did match the heavy-breathing excess of the 
accompaniment. Mission accomplished. But as the finale to the sole new work on 
the company's 25th anniversary tour, the solo and the piece provided only the 
smallest pretext for celebration.

COUNTERPUNCH : SOME CHILD STARS WERE VICTORS, NOT VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GIGI PERREAU, Gigi Perreau, a former child star, was one of the first 50 
celebrities honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She teaches, 
directs and is currently working on a book based on her life as a child of 
Hollywood in the '40s and '50s;Counterpunch is a weekly feature designed to let 
readers respond to reviews or stories about entertainment and the arts. If you

 As a bona fide former child star, I read "When Early Acting Careers Careen to 
an End" (Calendar, Jan. 5) with great interest. I consider Paul Petersen a 
friend, having taught with him last summer at the Donna Reed Foundation 
Performing Arts Festival in Denison, Iowa. (I also guested on a "Donna Reed 
Show" in the late '50s.) While I respect what he is trying to accomplish 
through his support group, I am compelled to add a positive note to his rather 
depressing findings. 
</P>
<P>
 My first film was "Madame Curie" in 1943 -- I played the baby -- and I 
continued working in more than 40 films, 100 TV shows and theatrical 
productions through the 1960s. My brother Peter Miles, a.k.a. Richard Miles, 
was the young boy in "The Red Pony," among many other roles, and my sister, 
Janine, also worked frequently as a child. My brother is now an author ("That 
Cold Day in the Park," "Angel Loves Nobody," etc.), a retired teacher and an 
international art appraiser. Janine, never crazy about acting, is married and a 
very successful businesswoman, working for the Housing Authority of the city of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I chose to marry and raise a family, but never felt I gave up my career. I 
used my visibility to give back some of the many blessings and recognition I 
had received. I have volunteered for the past 28 years as a spokesperson for 
the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, served on several other boards, 
including Will Geer's Theatricum Botanicum, have directed some community 
theater productions and, most important, have been teaching drama for the past 
eight years at Immaculate Heart High School, my alma mater, in Hollywood. I 
love the opportunity to share my almost 50 years experience with my students. 
</P>
<P>
 Did our careers "careen to an end"? I don't think so! We made choices to 
continue our lives and careers, based on the future, not on the past. I value 
the years of working with some of the greatest stars and directors ever.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I appreciate the dedication of studio teachers, especially the late Gladys 
Hoene, who worked closely with my schools, to assure that I did get a 
well-rounded education, and along with my parents, most definitely assured that 
I was never treated as "chattel." I enjoy the memories of my own railroad car 
touring the East Coast on behalf of Universal Studios, being grand marshal of 
the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, lighting the Christmas tree at New York's 
Central Park, staying at the penthouse apartment of Cecil Beaton at the 
Sherry-Netherland Hotel, having J. Edgar Hoover personally escort me through 
the FBI building in Washington and explain its workings. 
</P>
<P>
 A deprived childhood? Not for me! An incredible opportunity is how I truly 
feel. Would I like to work again as an actress? You bet! Why? Because I love 
it, and I'm very good. (I still am amazed at the amount of fan mail I receive 
from all over the world.) 
</P>
<P>
 Would I prefer to be directing television or films? Absolutely! But in the 
meantime, life goes on, and I will continue to share my experiences with my 
students, work on my book and look for an agent, as I continue to thank God for 
the lifetime of extraordinary opportunities that few children have ever had, 
and for my parents, husband and children who somehow managed to keep all these 
things in proper perspective.

COUNTERPUNCH : REVIEWER CLEARLY MISSED THE POINT OF 'OLEANNA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA HOLT, Paula Holt is the producer of Oleanna. Previously, she produced 
Alan Ayckbourn's Woman in Mind, Christopher Durang's Laughing Wild, Cynthia 
Heimel's A Girl's Guide to Chaos, and Erik Jendresen's The Killing of Michael 
Malloy at the Tiffany Theater, which she developed in in 1985;Counterpunch is a 
weekly feature designed to let readers respond to reviews or stories about 
entertainment and the arts. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While it's very tempting, I'm trying not to write an 
"I-just-didn't-like-your-review" response to Don Shirley's dismissive review of 
David Mamet's "Oleanna," which premiered at the Tiffany Theater on Feb. 4 
("Casting's Just One Bug in 'Oleanna,' " Calendar, Feb. 7). Shirley has two 
issues with the Los Angeles production: First, the dubbed-by-him "controversial 
casting" of Lionel Smith, an African American, as the professor, and second, he 
doesn't like the play itself. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first point, there is nothing "controversial" about a major playwright 
maintaining cast approval. The controversy reported by Shirley in previous 
articles and now so extensively in this review is that Lionel Smith is black. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not "Oleanna's" move from the Mark Taper was racially motivated 
really has nothing to do with the production he reviewed at the Tiffany. But 
instead of writing an in-depth review of the work itself (and the performances 
in particular), Shirley can't seem to see past the issue of Smith's race -- 
devoting a considerable portion of his review to this so-called "controversial 
casting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shockingly, the only description the reader is given of Kyra Sedgwick's superb 
performance, which carries half the play, is that she is "white," and that she 
"mastered most -- although, not quite all -- of Mamet's rapid-fire dialogue." 
Oh yes, and that she is too glamorous. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for critique and discussion of this production. As for the play 
itself, clearly Shirley doesn't like the play, and judging from his comments, 
doesn't get the play. "Oleanna" is a work that invites controversy and 
rebuttal, and judging from audiences and other reviews, it is an enraging, 
provocative, incensing, irritating and fascinating piece of theater. It is not 
necessarily loved by all who see it, but as Time magazine states, "reason 
enough to cheer for the future of the theater" (Nov. 2, 1992). 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna" is currently in production not only all over the country but all 
over the world -- with productions sold out in Germany, in Israel, in 
Switzerland and in London under Harold Pinter's direction. It has just closed 
in New York after a nearly two-year run. It is a wonderment that a whole body 
of critics and patrons takes Mamet, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, 
seriously, while Shirley seems so comfortable dismissing him. And it is this 
dismissive tone in Los Angeles' major metropolitan newspaper that I am 
addressing.  
</P>
<P>
 I am indeed not writing an "I-just-didn't-like-your-review" kind of letter. I 
am making a huge plea for responsible and intelligent criticism as opposed to 
the tabloid and flippant reporting that does nothing to enhance the status of 
the theater in Los Angeles.

MUSIC REVIEWS; BARTOK QUARTET WELCOMING AT DOHENY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing what has proven a particularly rich month locally for chamber 
music, with appearances by the Tokyo, Talich, Sine Nomine and Juilliard 
quartets, the Bartok Quartet of Budapest regaled its audience in the welcoming, 
intimate confines of the Doheny Mansion on Friday with playing of unremitting 
communicative intensity and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Bartoks say, they tend to say boldly.Thus, Haydn's "Emperor" Quartet 
projected a peasant vigor and, in the celebrated slow movement, rich individual 
sonorities and a play of light and shade far removed from the impersonal, 
reined-in style of presentation once regarded as ideal for music of the 
Classical era. 
</P>
<P>
 With Haydn, the quartet also approached the maximum number of intonational 
slips permitted within a single work. But, somehow, technical disorder is more 
than usually tolerable within the context of the energy and humanity of these 
artists' interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 Characteristically, in the infinitely sad and fiercely propulsive measures 
that alternate so strikingly in the Second Quartet of namesake composer Bela 
Bartok, the veteran ensemble -- violinists Peter Komlos and Geza Hargitai, 
violist Geza Nemeth and cellist Laszlo Mezo -- offered the kind of finely 
detailed, acutely balanced reading expected in a Haydn quartet, but with the 
darkly grand sonorities and subtle dramatic suspensions appropriate to Bartok's 
specific world. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the exquisite A-flat Quartet of Dvorak exhibited the members of the 
Bartok Quartet as impassioned singers, projecting the lyric arches and bolts of 
folksy energy with equal aplomb and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, under Los Angeles Philharmonic sponsorship, the Bartoks present a 
different program at University Synagogue in Brentwood. By all means, catch it.

MUSIC REVIEWS; GUITARIST PARKENING TUNES IN AT CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apologizing for a 10-degree temperature difference between the backstage area 
and the limelight that meant retuning his guitar every time he walked on stage, 
a soft-spoken Christopher Parkening amiably won over an enthusiastic audience 
Friday at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, his fine playing, at times assisted by guitarist David Brandon, of 
a program largely identical to one the two gave at Ambassador Auditorium in 
1992, didn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier music, however, found Parkening more idiosyncratic and less musical in 
interpretation than in works of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing Bach in the first preludes of the Well-Tempered Clavier and the 
Cello Suite No. 1 and in "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring," Parkening emphasized 
facile finger work and rhythmic drive at the expense of song and drama. In 
works by Praetorius, Dowland and good old Anonymous, he allowed himself 
occasional moments of odd rubato and gear-shifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he often drew from a palette of attractive, subtle colors, of 
which he continued to make use in Giuliani's Variations on a Theme of Handel 
and in the pieces that followed intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, amid fluidly played, rhythmically demanding works by Granados, Alexandre 
Tansman, Albeniz and other composers, Parkening proved perhaps most compelling 
in his introspective and relaxed phrasing in Villa-Lobos' Prelude No. 3 and his 
intense focus in that composer's Etude No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to cheers, Parkening and Brandon played an excerpt from Falla's "La 
Vida Breve," and, by himself, Parkening played a canario by Gaspar Sanz and a 
Catalonian lullaby, as encores. CHRIS PASLES

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: UCLA SERIES FEATURES A DOUBLE FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA Film Archive and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' 
Contemporary Documentary series continues Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in Melnitz 
Theater with Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson's 1992 "Black Harvest," one of the 
most impressive documentaries of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a vital, heartbreaking account of an ill-fated alliance. Joe Leahy, a 
wealthy Papua New Guinea coffee planter born of a native mother and a white 
Australian father, goes into partnership with a native tribe just as coffee 
prices fall, destroying the impoverished tribe's dreams.  
</P>
<P>
 The handsome, hard-driving Leahy is a man caught between two cultures, just as 
the tribe, which still resolves disputes with bow and arrow, is caught between 
past and present. Preceding "Black Harvest" will be Geoffrey O'Connor's "At the 
Edge of Conquest: The Journey of Chief Wai-Wai" (1992), about a native 
Brazilian making a massive last-ditch effort to preserve his people's 
traditional way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Archive's New Chinese Cinema series continues Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in 
Melnitz Theater with "Hibiscus Town" (1986), about the ironic fate of a couple 
who manage to build their own small house in a provincial community. Directed 
by Xie Jin, China's most prestigious veteran director, it was unavailable for 
preview.  
</P>
<P>
 It will be followed by "Old Well" (1987), directed by Wu Tianming, former head 
of the ground-breaking Xian Film Studios and now a Los Angeles-area resident. 
Writer Zheng Yi interweaves two stories to create a claustrophobic sense of the 
oppression of people straining at the chains of outmoded morality and 
technology. Zhang Yimou, now one of China's top directors, stars as Wangquan, a 
husky young man who lives in a remote mountain village where water has been 
scarce for as long as anyone can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 The film curses the cruelty of arranged marriages, just as it urges 
communities to pull together to solve their problems rather than merely hope 
that the central government will someday come to their rescue. "Old Well" is 
stirring and earthy, and it resists a didactic tone in its plea for 
self-determination both in personal and community life. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the socially critical "Old Well," Saturday's 7:30 p.m. double 
feature reveals a surprising degree of Hollywood influence. Zhou Xiaowen and 
Shi Chengfeng's "Desperation" (1987) is a classic killer-on-the-run tale, told 
with both compassion and detachment in regard to its hero (Zhang Jianmin). It 
is exceedingly well-constructed and edited, made with a subtle eye for detail.  
</P>
<P>
 Its almost documentary-like tone is at times so low-key that one's attention 
threatens to wander, but the film pulls together for a suspenseful finish 
aboard a train that depicts ordinary citizens behaving heroically in the face 
of impending danger. The last shot is uncompromising to a degree nearly 
inconceivable in Hollywood. (In addition to co-directing "Desperation," Shi 
Chengfeng also co-wrote it with Shi Chengquan.) 
</P>
<P>
 No American Western could be any more stylish or witty than He Ping's "The 
Swordsman in Double-Flag Town" (1991), and it brings to mind Clint Eastwood's 
"Unforgiven," his mentor Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns and even Kurosawa's 
"Seven Samurai." Gao Wei stars as a teen-ager, probably no more than 15 and 
looking even younger swaddled in buckskin, who heads out to the desert 
wilderness, his destination a small community where he is to claim the bride 
(Zhao Mana) he has never met.  
</P>
<P>
 Like the youthful heroes of universal legend, he must prove himself mightily 
to be worthy of his maiden's hand. In short, he must defeat a pair of nasty 
bandits and their gang who hold the town in terror. He does so with kung fu, 
but this film is steeped with an aura of genuine mysticism rather than the mere 
fantasy that is a staple of martial-arts movies. "The Swordsman in Double-Flag 
Town" has all the hip ingredients that could just turn it into a cult film in 
American theaters.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; TEPID DANCEHALL IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dancehall may be the commercially hot reggae style, but Saturday's 
performances at the two-day Bob Marley birthday celebration showed that it 
still is only sporadically effective in the live arena.  
</P>
<P>
 Headliner Buju Banton is the most popular, influential deejay (as the 
dancehall-style rappers are known) in Jamaica since Shabba Ranks, and his 
entrance did provide an impressive jolt of energy that galvanized the nearly 
full house at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But energy alone wasn't enough as Banton's hourlong set progressed. His rough, 
bellowing voice and thick patois rendered the lyrics indecipherable, and his 
vocal rhythms fell out of sync with the backing band several times. 
</P>
<P>
 The set peaked on an extended encore that found the lanky deejay playing his 
vocals against those of singers Wayne Wonder and Beres Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own Southern California debut, Hammond offered the day's strongest, 
most consistent set, and one of the few stressing song craft.  
</P>
<P>
 Wonder's smooth set of "lovers rock" was enjoyable and well-performed, but 
ultimately generic.  
</P>
<P>
 The annual festival sported something new this year -- three large video 
screens and two cartoonish backdrops adding bright color -- to complement its 
usual assortment of food and crafts booths. The Sunday bill was scheduled to 
feature roots reggae artists led by the Wailing Souls, Barrington Levy and the 
Mighty Diamonds. DON SNOWDEN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; LOS CAMPEROS TOPS MARIACHI FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Are Los Camperos de Nati Cano the world's best mariachi? That's how it looked 
during its set at the Universal Amphitheatre's mariachi festival on Saturday. 
The Los Angeles-based group deservedly earned the night's only standing ovation 
for a performance that was perhaps the best one seen during these last few 
years of mariachi fever in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Camperos, one of the orchestras that backed Linda Ronstadt on her 
"Canciones de mi padre" album and concerts, overshadowed the other three 
participants because it was innovative within the mariachi tradition -- for 
director Nati Cano, there is no need to concoct mariachi-ized versions of 
American pop classics or to include fashionable sounds.His is traditional 
mariachi music, but his arrangements and unpredictable vocal harmonies make it 
fresher than most. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Gallos de Crescencio Hernandez lost some points for including watered-down 
versions of "My Way" and "New York, New York," while the all-female Las 
Perlitas Tapatias opted to imitate a banda . It didn't quite work. 
</P>
<P>
 Renowned ranchera singer Angeles Ochoa -- backed by Los Gallos -- was one of 
the evening's highlights, but Los Camperos' Monica Trevino also confirmed her 
status as arguably the best female mariachi voice of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, which was closed by the fine Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan, 
should send a message to all mariachis: Forget about Sinatra for a second, and 
go back to the Jose Alfredo Jimenez songbook. ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI

THEATER REVIEW; 'CAMP'S' DISTURBING STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1917, a group of black soldiers in Houston mutinied, attacking and killing 
white civilians. They were later court-martialed, and 19 of them were hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Celeste Bedford Walker, a Houston-based playwright, examined this disturbing 
chapter of American military history in "Camp Logan." Mountaintop Productions' 
touring version of the play served as an apt commemoration of Black History 
Month over the weekend at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Walker's play is set in the barracks shared by five of the men. At the 
beginning of the play, as they arrive in Houston, they're hardly firebrands. 
They're eager to serve their country in the French trenches. But as the weeks 
pass, the indignities heaped on them by Jim Crow, as well as by their own white 
commanding officers, gnaw on their spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they realize they won't be sent to France after all. They're valued 
more as manual laborers than as soldiers. Their military service will not be a 
ticket to a fuller form of citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Told to disarm in the face of danger from a white mob, they refuse. If they 
can't fight the war abroad, they'll fight it at home. It's an idea that 
resonates far beyond the boundaries of Houston in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker takes her time building the tensions that finally explode, and it pays 
off, at least in the hands of the skilled Mountaintop ensemble, as directed by 
A.Y. Carriere-Anderson. Although the one white officer is a bit of a buffoon, 
the others are carefully delineated, and it is, after all, their story. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual carnage takes place offstage. Not only is this practical for a 
stripped-down touring version, but it makes dramatic sense. The real action 
occurs within these men's minds, particularly that of their black sergeant, 
played here by Steven Larry with a gravelly countenance and crackerjack timing.

MOVIE REVIEW; SEAGAL DIRECTS 'DEADLY GROUND' MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With "On Deadly Ground" (general release), Steven Seagal not only makes his 
directorial debut but also risks combining action with a message, a deadly 
serious, intelligent protest against the threat to the environment posed by the 
oil industry. He also does some consciousness-raising in regard to the rights 
of Native Americans and the spiritual values their Inuit culture has to offer 
all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you could certainly wish that Seagal and his writers, Ed Horowitz and 
Robin U. Russin, could have found less preachy ways to express themselves, "On 
Deadly Ground" is otherwise lively entertainment for action fans. Seagal is to 
be admired for using his stardom to send a warning; most people at the first 
show at the AMC Century 14 last Friday sat through Seagal's much-publicized 
long, impassioned speech. What he has to say is important, and he may succeed 
in reaching a segment of the audience who have never thought about the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In plot, "On Deadly Ground" is simplicity itself. Seagal plays an oil rigger 
for Michael Caine's oil company. Caine is racing against a tight deadline in 
getting his Alaskan oil rig and refinery in operation. If he misses the 
deadline, his oil rights, which he's held for 20 years, revert to the Eskimos. 
Nevertheless, Seagal, a regular Red Adair when it comes to putting out oil 
fires, discovers that Caine has been cutting corners to the extent of 
endangering the environment; this knowledge, in turn, endangers Seagal's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Dangerous Ground," a handsome, big-budget production, has a comic book 
sensibility in which Seagal is a super-hero up against villains of the deepest 
hue. However, along with his own star presence, Seagal has lined up other 
strong pluses. The majesty of cameraman Ric Waite's images of Alaska's snowy 
wilderness is matched by Basil Poledouris' sweeping score. Best of all is 
Caine's deliciously nasty villain, hot-tempered, ruthless, his evil underlined 
by a dark, severe dye job. Caine's chief minion is an ultra-hyper John C. 
McGinley, and Joan Chen is the beautiful Native American activist with whom 
Seagal shares the final fade-out.

TV REVIEW; 'BELONGING' TELLS TRUTH OF NATIONALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The blitzed and gutted Olympic venues of Sarajevo are haunting the '94 games, 
and not just because gold medal figure skater Scott Hamilton can't believe that 
the site of his greatest victory is now a graveyard. Sarajevo is a rude slap at 
Olympic family-of-man idealism, a crudely potent statement of nationalism's 
allure and deadliness. 
</P>
<P>
 It's profoundly timely, then, that writer-host Michael Ignatieff's brilliant 
six-part series, "Blood and Belonging: Journeys Into the New Nationalism," 
begins in the former Yugoslavia (though in Croatia, north of Bosnia and 
Sarajevo) and airs smack in the middle of Olympic prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 (The series shows nightly starting at 10 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the games themselves parade national pride -- which is no bad 
thing, Ignatieff reminds. What seems most dubious, though, is the suppression 
of motherland attachments for some other goal: a United Nations-type governance 
or the kind of dictated federation successfully imposed by Marshal Tito on the 
Yugoslav ethnic groups for nearly 40 years. Contained for too long, the 
nationalistic impulse for ethnic cleansing will eventually explode. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignatieff finds a superbly cinematic metaphor for both Tito's Yugoslavia and 
the current factionalism: the Highway of Brotherhood and Unity that cuts 
through the heart of the former nation, linking Belgrade in the center with 
Zagreb in the north. By traversing it, with U.N. press badge in hand, he comes 
in touch with a wide range of the players in the now-simmering war between 
Croats and the minority Serbs who have formed enclaves to resist Croatian 
domination. 
</P>
<P>
 As the program title suggests, it truly is a "Road to Nowhere": Ignatieff 
finds senselessness everywhere, from the pillaging of a museum commemorating 
the Nazi Croat-run concentration camps to a Croat partisan insisting that he 
can't live with Serbs even as he's being aided by Serb women. Each group 
insists on its differences, yet Ignatieff can't spot any, and the groups can't 
tell him exactly what they are. 
</P>
<P>
 A lesson of Croatia, as Ignatieff sees it, is that "you can't build a nation 
on lies," but he wonders, as he ventures to Ukraine in the second segment, 
"Lifting the Yoke," if the former Soviet republic is building its nationhood on 
a myth. It seems right that a country with a distinct language and culture 
should free itself of Russian domination, although it also seems impossible, 
considering Russian and Ukrainian economic interdependence. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a redolent place for Ignatieff: His grandfather built a Russian 
Orthodox church in Ukraine, and, as he observes his grandfather's crypt and the 
church rituals, the nonbelieving grandson says he's beginning to understand the 
passions behind nationalism. They are both the irrational desire for a 
long-gone home of your own kind, as well as the human need for a home and a 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Ignatieff understands these so well -- and articulates them with a 
thoughtful, conversational tone recalling Jacob Bronowski in his TV opus, "The 
Ascent of Man" -- he is able to sit down with the lions and the lambs, the 
neo-Nazi skinheads and the liberals of modern Germany in the third segment, 
"The Nation Returns." Here, as well as in the final three segments in Kurdish 
homelands, Quebec and Northern Ireland, Ignatieff is forever testing the 
beliefs of those he encounters -- not for confrontational TV, but for truths 
that may define a humane nation-state.

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: IF LIGHTS ARE SYNCHRONIZED, WHY DO WE KEEP STOPPING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You sit idle in gridlock, fuming over your surface-street commute. Red lights 
shine tauntingly ahead for at least a mile, overhead on traffic signals and 
from the backs of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems hopeless -- unless you're driving on Santa Monica Boulevard in 
Beverly Hills. There, almost magically, half a dozen traffic signals suddenly 
turn green at precisely the same moment. Within a few seconds you peel away 
from the pack and whiz unmolested for several minutes through a bank of smiling 
stoplights. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, you sigh. The beauty of synchronized signals in action. Technology to 
soothe the savage motorist and smooth the commutes of the area's rich and 
famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, of course," says Jennifer Smith, manager of a Santa Monica Boulevard 
flower shop. "It's Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 It sure is. But it might come as something of a surprise to learn that it's 
also supposed to be that way in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, transportation officials say, the City of Angels has had a similar system 
in place for 20 years. All 4,000 stoplights along about 7,000 miles of road 
were wired back in the 1970s to realize that elusive dream: a seamless ride 
through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It just may not be as obvious in Los Angeles as on that stretch of Santa 
Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills. But it's there. Timers at every intersection 
regulate the flow of cars, and every 100 to 200 stoplights are hooked together 
to a master clock that controls signal patterns over a fairly wide radius. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, motorists should come to a full stop only rarely, especially while 
traveling on major thoroughfares. If they stick to the speed limit, they should 
be able to watch the stoplights successively turn green as they approach -- 
presto, abracadabra, open sesame. 
</P>
<P>
 But try telling that to Sherman Oaks stockbroker Robert Lobel. Like other 
motorists accustomed to heavy backups, he scoffs at the existence of a 
synchronization system. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're telling me they are synchronized and I don't believe it," Lobel says. 
"It's terrible. The main streets are a nightmare. I bet if you ask 100 people, 
99 would say they're not synchronized." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what seems to be the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, for one, the system is two decades old -- hardly the latest technology. 
Equipment sometimes fails. Some stoplights are irregularly spaced or too close 
together, making timing difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, traffic flows have changed dramatically since the timing mechanisms were 
installed, and some intersections may not have been updated to reflect new 
patterns, says Anson Nordby, a senior engineer with the city Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 And out of a corps of 10 city engineers dedicated to traffic signal 
operations, only four go out and fix or adjust signals and timers throughout 
the entire city -- a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the others are busy working with new computerized gadgetry designed to 
deal with another major problem that bedevils the system: plain old human 
unpredictability. 
</P>
<P>
 As everyone knows, drivers pour onto the streets at odd hours. Accidents 
happen. Pesky pedestrians insist on crossing the road. Maintenance crews block 
lanes. Spectators clog streets for concerts and sporting events. And rain ruins 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The current synchronization system cannot adjust to traffic conditions that 
fluctuate daily, even hourly. "It's not as responsive to dynamic changes in 
traffic as we'd like," Nordby says. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1998, Nordby hopes, the current system will be obsolete, 
replaced by the much-vaunted $300-million ATSAC system, or Automated Traffic 
Surveillance and Control. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ATSAC system relies on video cameras and sensors embedded in the pavement 
to relay up-to-the-minute traffic data to a subterranean nerve center beneath 
City Hall. Experts there monitor the traffic and can override the computers to 
produce something "more elegant than what the system can come up with," Nordby 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 ATSAC is already operating 1,500 signals; installation of another 500 is under 
way. The system is part of the "smart corridors" along the Santa Monica Freeway 
and is up and running in Downtown Los Angeles, West Los Angeles and Hollywood, 
around Los Angeles International Airport and along Ventura Boulevard in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordby says a study two years ago showed that the system cut travel time by 
18% and increased speeds by 16%. More recently, ATSAC helped iron out heavy 
traffic flow on major surface streets after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lobel, the stockbroker, finds the new system as hard to believe in as the 
old one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't noticed it," he says skeptically, remembering crawls along Ventura 
Boulevard. "You definitely stop." 
</P>
<P>
 In parts of West Los Angeles and Hollywood, where ATSAC is already on line, an 
unscientific comparison also produced interesting results. A 1 1/2-mile stretch 
of Wilshire Boulevard between Barrington Avenue and Sepulveda Boulevard took an 
average of eight minutes to traverse during the morning rush hour; a similar 
drive on Sunset Boulevard between Cahuenga Boulevard and Normandie Avenue took 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did an equal distance on Santa Monica Boulevard in Beverly Hills, which 
uses the conventional timing method, average only four minutes? 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to tell without examining those intersections, Nordby says. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Jennifer Smith is right. It's Beverly Hills, home of the wealthy and 
powerful. Maybe "life in the fast lane" isn't just a metaphor after all.

GEORGE RAMOS: CHICANO AGENDA GETTING BIGGER PLAY IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't just another political meeting. Instead of gossiping about the 
upcoming race for governor or the U.S. Senate, a dozen prominent Mexican 
American leaders met last weekend in a Downtown Los Angeles hotel to discuss 
this year's presidential election in Mexico and what they want from the new 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 They just didn't talk about it. They acted like a special-interest group in an 
election in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 The local Chicanos met with a personal emissary of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the 
presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling political party, and presented him 
with a list of demands, although the Mexican Americans didn't call it that. But 
it sure looked like one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicanos want expanded cultural, educational and sports programs between 
the Mexican government and Mexican Americans. They want the Mexican government 
to consider using Chicano professionals for various business and government 
ventures, complaining that qualified Mexican Americans were often passed over 
in favor of others. 
</P>
<P>
 They also asked Mexican officialdom to take the time to better understand 
Mexican Americans and their place in U.S. society. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the Chicanos can become a lobbying force and conduit for Mexican 
interests and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute exchange with Colosio emissary Santiago Onate Laborde, over 
coffee and Mexican sweet bread, left the Chicano politicos happy but still 
angling for more leverage in a Mexico rocked by the recent Zapatista uprising 
in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very productive first meeting," said Los Angeles school board 
President Leticia Quezada. "The purpose of the meeting was our agenda, not the 
PRI's." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, such a meeting would have been unimaginable. Mexican officials 
did not take Chicanos and their concerns very seriously because, after all, 
Chicanos are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Mexicans believed that Chicanos were on the lower economic and social 
rung in this country. That belief was strengthened by the inability of many 
Mexican Americans to speak Spanish, which horrified certain Mexicans, according 
to Jorge Bustamante, Mexico's leading researcher on Chicanos. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Mexican Americans reveled in their heritage and many Mexican 
traditions. But they were ambivalent about the PRI, which has run Mexico since 
its inception in 1929. Their families had left Mexico because they were cynical 
about PRI's dominance and the slim chances for prosperity there. 
</P>
<P>
 But things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacts between the Mexican government and Chicanos started in 1971 during 
the tenure of President Luis Echeverria and quickened when Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari assumed the presidency in 1988. Quezada and other Chicanos met with 
Salinas in Tijuana and came away with agreements for Mexican-trained teachers 
to come to the United States to help with this country's bilingual programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a Mexican cultural institute was established in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican American 
lawmakers cast key votes in favor of NAFTA when it passed Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the matter of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebellion in Mexico's version of Mississippi has been a public relations 
nightmare for Salinas, especially in this country. For example, Juan Jose 
Gutierrez, head of a Boyle Heights nonprofit immigration agency, recently 
called Colosio a political "dead cadaver" who can't win because of Chiapas. 
Those comments were picked up and duly noted in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 When Onate met the L.A. Chicanos, led by Quezada and Montebello attorney Raul 
Ayala, he was happy to talk about Chiapas. He allowed that army abuses probably 
occurred during the brief fighting but pointedly added that abuses were also 
committed by the Zapatistas. These things unfortunately occur in times of war, 
Onate said, citing U.S. atrocities in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one (in Mexico) condones that, but it happened," Onate said. "We have to 
confront it and deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicanos were impressed with Onate's response, knowing he reflects the 
party's thinking since he is a rising star in the PRI. They, too, have heard 
the talk that Onate may become Mexico's foreign minister in a Colosio 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio isn't the only presidential candidate in the Aug. 28 election. There 
are at least six others, including Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the populist son of a 
former president who bolted from the PRI in disgust and nearly defeated Salinas 
for president in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to talk to them too," Quezada said, no doubt remembering an American 
political lesson of covering your bases.

 Much has been written on African American mothers as significant figures in 
the black family. As grandmother, mother, sister and aunt, they are seen as 
strong, resilient forces who sometimes single-handedly hold the family

 But African American fathers are nurturers, too. I praise those fathers, who 
despite being the victims of racism and poverty, continue to provide stability, 
hope and love for their families. They are the grandfathers, fathers, uncles 
and brothers who are unsung heroes in American life. They are men like my dad, 
David Nash Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, I knew that next to God, the greatest powers in my life were my 
parents. And central to my life was a father who loved his family more than 
himself. We were very poor, so poor that we had holes in the bottoms of our 
shoes by springtime. We lived in the projects of Los Angeles. Our daily meals 
were beans, greens and cornbread. Yet we were rich in pride, confidence and 
love.  
</P>
<P>
 We Nash children -- all eight of us -- knew that our father would work with 
all his might to make sure our dreams were not deferred. No drinking or 
gambling away his paycheck on Fridays. No resentment in having only one good 
suit and a pair of Stacy Adams shoes to wear for weddings, funerals, lodge 
meetings. Dad's entertainment was family oriented: Dodger games (Saturday was 
ladies night -- 50 cents); Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm chicken dinners 
once a year; family picnics, holiday feasts and drive-in movies ($1 a car). 
Every four years, we drove across country in a crowded station wagon -- three 
of us to a seat -- to visit relatives in Hope, Ark. Family meant a lot to Dad. 
We were his life. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sharecropper's son in Hope, Dad was allowed to go only as far as the 
sixth grade. Dad knew what racism had denied him, and he wanted to make sure it 
would not steal his children's future. Therefore, he preached education to us 
day and night. When I was a little girl, Daddy told me that he would "drink 
muddy water and sleep in a hollow log" if I wanted to go to school. I did not 
know then how much you would have to love someone to make such a promise. But I 
made good on Dad's promise, graduating at the top of my high-school class, 
becoming a Woodrow Wilson fellow and receiving a Ph.D. from UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 Everything associated with school received Dad's highest consideration and 
sacrifice -- science projects, speech contests, awards programs, college night, 
SATs. With only one car in the family, Dad often got a ride to work with a 
friend so that Mom could take us to school and church functions. (Recently, Dad 
went without a car so his grandson could attend a better high school in Los 
Angeles and not be worried about gang violence on the way home from school.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dad's job in the steel mills of Los Angeles did not afford him the benefits of 
paid time off for personal business. So every high school graduation cost Dad 
half a day's pay, and he never missed a one of the eight. Everyone at his job 
knew when it was one of his kids' graduation because it was the only time Dad 
requested time off. These were Dad's proudest moments. 
</P>
<P>
 In so many ways, Daddy provided the support I needed to attend school and not 
be worried about tomorrow. When I got my first part-time job, my Daddy gave me 
a long talk about the insignificance of my job in relationship to my long-term 
goals. He said if it interfered with school, I should quit.  
</P>
<P>
 Dad did more than make me feel financially and emotionally secure. He was my 
greatest fan. Once, while attending UCLA, I spent an entire night studying for 
a final exam in Greek and Roman oratory. Surely my Dad could not help me study. 
But he paced the floor from his bedroom to the bathroom, peeping into my room 
periodically saying, "Haven't you finished yet? You need some rest." I would 
promise to go to bed in just a few more minutes. Eventually, I went to bed 
around 5 a.m. so that I could get two hours of rest before my 8 a.m. exam. 
Around 6:30, I was awakened by the smell of bacon and eggs. My Dad was cooking 
my breakfast. He said I needed my strength to do my best. When my grade of "A" 
came to my home the next week, I placed it over the fireplace near his mail 
because I realized it was really his achievement too. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad is retired now. A few years ago, when I called him early in the morning 
and he wasn't home, I later found out that he was caring for a sick 2-month-old 
great-granddaughter because he didn't want his granddaughter to miss her class 
at Trade Tech College. At 75, he still preaches education, attends his 
grandchildren's graduations and continues to provide us with the stability, 
security and confidence we need to face the world. He has never forsaken us. We 
will never forsake him. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many fathers like David Nash who give their children the hope, 
stability, security and love they need to blossom. They are not listed in Who's 
Who, chairmen of any boards or leading marches for freedom. They simply and 
quietly love their children in a powerful, nurturing way.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES; GETTING ANSWERS; WHY 
IS THE COST OF DISABLED PARKING TICKETS SO HIGH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK L. RUGH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am raising my voice against cities and counties where police have been 
authorized, for revenue raising, to issue an excessive fine for parking in a 
space marked "Reserved for the Handicapped." The City of San Gabriel recently 
raised its fine for this type of ticket from $125 to $330. This amount of 
pecuniary punishment is 10 times more than a ticket for parking in front of a 
fire hydrant -- a more serious violation, in my book. 
</P>
<P>
 If this trend continues unabated, I predict that local government agencies all 
over the state will be tempted to keep raising this fine as a convenient source 
of additional revenue. What is to prevent cities and counties from raising the 
fine from $330 to $530? Is the sky the limit? 
</P>
<P>
 To check this local political fund-raising game, I suggest that the 
Legislature act quickly to amend the motor vehicle code to put a cap on this 
unfair practice. 
</P>
<P>
 I recommend that the state lawmakers step in to prevent any city or county 
police parking patrol officer from writing a ticket in excess of $30 for 
parking in a space marked for the handicapped. Make the monetary punishment $30 
-- equal to what a resident of San Gabriel or a visitor to that city must pay 
to clear up a ticket for parking in front of a fire plug. 
</P>
<P>
 Any Californian who has been hit with one of these excessive $330 fines should 
be given a refund.  
</P>

<P>
 The state Legislature enacted parking restrictions that require 
disabled-person parking spaces to be located on the shortest accessible route 
of travel at an accessible entrance or exit of a building or parking facility. 
Placement of such parking spaces provides accessibility to the physically 
disabled at no cost to taxpayers. At the same time, it encourages people with 
physical disabilities to go outdoors, promoting better health and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Police Department supports the intent of the Legislature and 
encourages the enforcement of all disabled parking restrictions. The purpose of 
enforcing these restrictions is to ensure that disabled persons have access to 
the designated parking spaces. Enforcement is used as a deterrent for 
violators. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel, like most communities in Southern California, realized an 
increase in population of about 10% during the 1980s. Along with the population 
increase, the city realized the revitalization of its business community. Open 
space has become a commodity, limiting the number of parking spaces.  
</P>
<P>
 Some motorists use parking spaces reserved for the disabled in the mistaken 
belief that they legally qualify even though they do not have a disabled 
parking placard. Other motorists have been known to obtain these placards 
fraudulently. These practices discourage people who qualify for the spaces from 
shopping and conducting business within the community.  
</P>
<P>
 The current penalty of $330 was adopted on Sept. 18, 1991, by the California 
Judicial Council and state and county statute. Agencies that enforce disabled 
parking restrictions using state Vehicle Code sections, including the San 
Gabriel Police Department, are held to this specific penalty. Some agencies may 
have slightly lower penalties because they use local ordinances instead.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 1 of last year, Assembly Bill 408 decriminalized parking violations 
and transferred processing activity from the courts to the issuing agency. This 
legislation allows cities to set their own penalties for citations. However, it 
has restrictions to limit disparity among surrounding cities. San Gabriel chose 
to retain its penalty schedule.

 I think I'd be involved in ratting when the activity would be a threat to 
other students, to myself or even to the person I'd tell on. I would definitely 
tell if it had to do with drugs or guns because I have a younger brother in 
this school and I wouldn't want him to be exposed to that kind of threat. I 
don't really like that word ratting. In our society, if we tell on someone it's 
considered ratting on them and it's bad. But it's not bad because if there's a 
problem like drugs or guns you need to tell someone so that other people won't 
get hurt or so that they can get help.

 I don't think I would tell on friends if they did something wrong. To me, 
friendship is more important than telling on someone. It would be a betrayal of 
their trust if I did. Maybe I would talk to them about what they did, but I 
would not consider telling on them.

 My friends would probably have to really hurt someone for me to tell on them. 
It has to do with the issue of trust. It would have to be something pretty bad 
for me to risk losing a friend. I've seen people fighting. I would try to get 
them to back off before I would tell on them.

 It depends on what they did. If it involved hurting or killing a human being, 
then I suppose I would. But anything else, it's not worth it. If they cheat on 
a test or steal a candy bar, nobody cares. And I don't think things like that, 
cheating on test or stealing or writing graffiti is worth putting a friendship 
on the line. Maybe I would tell my friends that they didn't have to steal 
because I would have bought it for them if they wanted it bad enough. But I 
wouldn't tell on them. It's just not that important.

 I am the type of person who chooses friends carefully. If one of my friends 
was involved in a wrongdoing, I would discuss the matter with him or her to 
read between the lines and encourage him or her to change. I would definitely 
turn a friend in if that person was involved in a serious matter. However, if 
it was something small, such as gossiping or lying, I wouldn't tell the other 
person about it because you could get in a lot of trouble. Some considerations 
would be whether or not I could remain anonymous and what would be done should 
I turn my friend in. I would have to force my mind to believe the fact that 
this person is my friend is irrelevant; hopefully, my heart would believe me.

 If life were strictly black and white, it would be simple to either turn in my 
friend or not. Unfortunately, there are countless shades of gray. I could just 
cut to the chase and say, "Yes, I would turn them in." Anyone could. When it 
actually comes down to the wire, would I? If it was life-threatening, I would 
obviously be forced to turn them in, or would I? After all, they've entrusted 
me with something, shown confidence in me. Could I break that? If it was 
nothing too serious, I couldn't turn them in. What harm could one little thing 
do? In life, the only person who can truly answer that question is you. 
</P>
<P>
 My response would have to depend on the situation. I do believe, in the end, 
my answer is like that of the trooper: "I'll cross that bridge when I come to 
it."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES: A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES; COMMUNITY ESSAY; 
MULTIETHNIC STUDIES ARE NEEDED FOR ALL

<P>
By CARLOS M. JIMENEZ, Carlos M. Jimenez teachers at Garfield High School in Los 
Angeles. He is the author of The Mexican-American Heritage (TQS Publications, 
1992). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of those days at the end of a semester when the teacher is trying 
to sum up lessons learned over the term. In my Mexican American Studies class 
at predominantly Latino Garfield High School in East Los Angeles, I had one of 
my best and brightest groups of students in years. 
</P>
<P>
 We had covered tens of thousands of years of history in the class. We were 
finishing up with Mexican American experiences in Southern California during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 My students had learned how Mexican people had been segregated from whites in 
the 1940s. We had looked at the infamous "Pachuco Riots" and the Sleepy Lagoon 
murder trial, both unfortunate examples of overt racism against Mexicans in Los 
Angeles. I made comparisons to what had been done to Jews in Germany and to 
Japanese and Japanese Americans here in California. We discussed the effects of 
racial prejudice and of stereotypes. I concluded by making a plea for racial 
and cultural understanding in this complex and diverse city. Suddenly, one 
student stuck his hand up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I just don't like them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who don't you like?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Them . . . you know, Asians. They think they're better than us," he mumbled. 
"I just don't like 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 No one challenged his statements. No one seemed bothered by them.  
</P>
<P>
 Extensive news coverage has been devoted to student demands for Chicano 
Studies programs at both the high school and college level, including the 
hunger strike late last year at UCLA. But these efforts must be put in the 
context of some troubling events. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago at Jordan High School, which was once predominantly African 
American but is rapidly becoming Latino, there was a Cinco de Mayo assembly. 
The black students walked out. At Alhambra High in the San Gabriel Valley, 
racial tensions have flared between Latino and Asian students, including 
fistfights and stabbings. In past decades, these types of clashes would have 
been white versus black. Today, it is Asians versus Mexicans or Latinos versus 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican Americans with strong cultural pride insist on being called Chicanos. 
They emphatically reject the term Hispanic as being insulting and inaccurate. 
Yet when referring to Asian people, many young Latinos use the term Chinos or 
Chinitos. A significant number of my students at Garfield do not know the 
difference between a Vietnamese, a Cambodian, a Chinese or a Japanese person. 
To large numbers of the Mexican American teen-agers at Garfield, all Asians are 
Chinos. And like the student in my class, many believe that Chinos are "rich" 
and "stuck up." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, only a handful of my students know the difference between Armenians 
and Iranians, two of the largest ethnic groups in Los Angeles. This ignorance 
is scary. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who has taught Chicano Studies in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District for 15 years, I am totally committed to this curriculum. But what good 
does it do to be knowledgeable and proud of your own cultural identity and yet 
ignorant and potentially racist toward others? In our increasingly multiethnic 
world, Chicano Studies is just not enough for young Chicano and Latino 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed is required multicultural studies for all students, beginning 
at a very early age. USC has implemented such a requirement, but younger people 
need the same thing. Alhambra High students have drafted a bill that would 
require California students to take a class in multicultural awareness before 
graduating. Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Alhambra) has introduced the bill 
to the Legislature.  
</P>
<P>
 Some would brand this blatant "political correctness." But many who oppose 
multicultural education are themselves woefully ignorant of the ethnic 
diversity of the United States. Maybe such a program would help reduce the 
alarming rise of hate crimes and the ugly racial incidents we all have 
witnessed in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 To the activists who are pushing for more Chicano Studies, I say: Keep up the 
fight! But stop and think a moment the next time you or someone you know uses 
the term Chino. Reflect on how much you dislike being ignorantly lumped 
together with all other Latinos as Hispanic.

By ELI HECHT, Rabbi Eli Hecht is spiritual leader of Chabad of South Bay in 
Lomita. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a rabbi for the last 24 years, I turn to the Bible for inspiration. After 
all, it has been a best-seller and translated into every language possible. I 
always find answers to complex problems in simple biblical standards. Let me 
illustrate:  
</P>
<P>
 A woman of high professional standing and education visited me seeking 
pastoral advice. Her dilemma related to her marriage, family and work. She was 
unable to balance her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that there was much more here, I asked if she had sought help from a 
therapist or psychiatrist. She said that she had been seeing a psychiatrist for 
the last two years. Nothing had changed, and now she felt completely helpless. 
As a last resort, she turned to religion. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked her three questions: * Is your therapist married or divorced? 
</P>
<P>
 * Does your therapist believe in God and organized religion? 
</P>
<P>
 * Does your therapist love children? 
</P>
<P>
 She thought the questions over before slowly stating that in all three cases, 
the answer was negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Her psychiatrist had been married and remarried and was going through a second 
divorce. He said he did not believe in religion, claiming that it was 
repressive and guilt-evoking. And last but not least, he added that he did not 
especially care for children, whom he described as "ego-centered." "And not 
everyone has the patience to care for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I then asked her if she believed in God and wanted to remain married. She 
immediately answered, "Of course," adding, "I love my children." I told her 
that her actions were incongruent: Going to a healer who does not live the way 
she wants to live is absurd. If anything, her therapist personified the 
opposite lifestyle. At the very least, she should have found a healer that had 
two of the three characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ten Commandments come to mind. It's been said that they really are 
commandments, not just suggestions. They teach us how to live happily. We are 
not to covet, but we are to love, share and respect one another. By observing 
them, we learn to love our children, care for our fellow man and be faithful to 
our spouses. That is the stabilizing force for living the good life. 
</P>
<P>
 The commandments were originally given to the Jewish nation. But there is no 
monopoly on good things.  
</P>
<P>
 Therapists, doctors, social workers and even spiritual healers help those in 
need. However, they carry the responsibility of first obeying the commandments 
and setting standards. Society receives inspiration from the example set by its 
healers. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish the woman hadn't waited two years before turning to God for help and 
inspiration.

 "The Sepulveda Wildlife Reserve is an oasis in the middle of urban sprawl. 
It's one of the great places in L.A. County for wildlife.When I found this 
place, it was like, "Wow," it's close to home, it's peaceful and there's a 
pond. I'm a birder so I bring my binoculars. There are ducks, hawks and lots of 
Canada geese in the winter. You've probably got between 100 and 200 species of 
birds here throughout the year."

<P>

</P>
<P>
 The 108-acre Sepulveda Wildlife Reserve is located at the intersection of the 
Ventura (101) and the San Diego (405) freeways, adjacent to Woodley Avenue. It 
developed after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. When clay soil was removed to 
repair the earthen Van Norman Dam, the borrow pit filled with water and 
attracted a great diversity of birds. In 1991, the pond was enlarged to 11 
acres and designated a refuge for migratory waterfowl. The reserve is part of 
the 1,500-acre Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, which also has walking paths, a 
10-mile bicycle path, golf courses, lighted tennis courts, an archery range and 
boating and fishing on Lake Balboa.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's failure to provide funds in the federal budget to 
relieve the impact of providing services to undocumented immigrants is a severe 
blow to states like California that are home to large numbers of undocumented 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 It signals to us, as it will to others, that if there is a way the states can 
relieve themselves (other than asking for federal help) from the cost of 
providing services to these immigrants, they should do so.The result, we fear, 
will be further scapegoating of immigrants as the cause for the state's 
financial woes and worsening of an already virulent anti-immigrant wave of 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that the services now being provided to these immigrants are the 
result of federal mandates and federal failure to develop and implement 
sensible and humanitarian programs to deal with undocumented immigrants. The 
resulting burden placed on a few states is unfair, given the fact that 
undocumented immigrants also pay income taxes and excise taxes, which flow 
directly to the federal treasury along with their Social Security and 
unemployment taxes, taxes they are forbidden to collect.  
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, those taxes which are paid and uncollectible by 
undocumented immigrants should be returned to the states, along with 80% of the 
cost of providing mandated services. This would be a fair and equitable 
solution to this very thorny problem.

NOT MUCH ELSE MANDELA COULD DO; SOUTH AFRICAN LEGEND OFFERS DUAL VOTING SYSTEM 
TO CALM ALL GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new South Africa must remain governable after apartheid if democracy is to 
take root. The next president, very probably Nelson Mandela, cannot afford 
constant attacks from blacks or whites who fear domination by his African 
National Congress. Better to resolve these conflicts before the April elections 
solidify the transfer of power but perhaps trigger a permanent Balkanization. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult challenge remains how to placate an unlikely but powerful 
alliance of spoilers: thousands of secession-minded Zulus and white right-wing 
extremists who demand their own independent nations and plan to boycott the 
balloting. They must be included in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela is not inflexible. Although the hugely popular leader need not 
compromise to be elected, he must make concessions to discourage bloody divides 
if he is to govern effectively. He acknowledges that "we must treat the threat 
of civil war seriously." To discourage further violence, he must foster 
participation in the new democracy by South Africans who do not pledge 
allegiance to his ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela is now willing to hold two separate votes, one to elect national 
leaders and the other to pick regional leaders. The twin votes would replace 
the proposed single vote that would have given the ANC an advantage in both 
national and regional races. The double balloting would allow Zulus, for 
example, a greater say in how their region would be governed. It is a practical 
move. But is it enough?  
</P>
<P>
 President Frederik W. de Klerk thinks the compromise is sufficient to clear 
the way for all parties to participate in the April balloting. He plans to 
recall Parliament the first week of March to rule on the ANC's latest 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who was briefed by Mandela Friday, supports the change and 
indicates that Washington will continue to work to persuade all groups to 
participate in the April elections. Perhaps Clinton should speak directly to 
Mandela's old rival, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the Zulu chief who runs 
KwaZulu, the quasi-independent Zulu homeland, and leads the Zulu-based Inkatha 
Freedom Party. He remains unplacated. Buthelezi fears a clean sweep by the ANC 
despite the election proposal that would give Zulus a greater voice in their 
area. However, the negotiating isn't over. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again Mandela proves just how shrewd a politician he is. He has 
compromised with groups that his primary constituency, particularly the more 
militant wing of the ANC, views as enemies. Against the militants' wishes he 
will try to accommodate the Zulus who do not support him -- in the same way 
that he has accommodated the white men who were his jailers. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as expected, Mandela becomes president, he will be the president of all 
South Africans. He already is demonstrating how to govern a united nation.

HOSPITAL SELF-DIAGNOSIS: CHANGE, OR PERISH; ST. JOHN'S SAGA SHOWS WHY 
BED-CENTERED HOSPITALS MAY BE DINOSAURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It speaks volumes about hospital care today to say that 100 of the 300 
patients at St. John's Hospital and Medical Center in Santa Monica were sent 
home when the Jan. 17 earthquake forced the venerable institution to shut both 
of its in-patient wings. Since then, the hospital's administrators have been 
asking themselves: Why were the patients there in the first place if they could 
go home? It is a good question, one that goes to the heart of the national 
debate over health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake puts hospitals in Southern California in a unique position to lead 
the nation in designing the hospital of the 21st Century. New medical and 
information technologies, forced by the radically changed economics of 
medicine, have in certain ways made even the most modern hospitals obsolete. 
St. John's will rebuild, but the new hospital will certainly be very different, 
and smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the quake, hospitals here and across the country were struggling 
with a harsh fact of life: They are losing their traditional function as the 
main center of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 With most surgery now done on an outpatient basis, occupancy rates have 
plunged. According to the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems, 18 
hospitals in the state closed last year and the number of beds staffed for 
patients has dropped by about 40% in the last decade; still, most hospitals are 
"over-bedded" and operate in the red. One shuttered wing of the California 
Medical Center downtown is regularly rented out to movie companies that need a 
hospital setting. Apparently there is sometimes more profit in make-believe 
doctors, nurses and patients than real ones. 
</P>
<P>
 All major hospitals are gearing up to compete under the new "managed care" 
paradigm that is forcing tight controls on patient spending. The hospitals 
themselves are going into the managed-care business. Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center and Huntington Memorial Hospital, for example, are joining with doctor 
groups to form their own health maintenance organizations. Mergers and 
consolidations are the order of the day. Whatever emerges from the tortured 
debate on health reform in Washington is likely to hasten these trends. It all 
means more emphasis on primary care, the family doctor, and less on specialists 
and hospitals. St. John's has furloughed 1,700 of its 2,050 employees, and many 
will never be rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 All this has major implications for building or rebuilding a hospital today. 
Clearly fewer inpatient beds are needed. Technology will dictate architecture 
and organization. For example, Dr. Thomas M. Heric, senior vice president at 
St. John's, talks about sending surgery patients home quickly and monitoring 
them by video. 
</P>
<P>
 When it reopens, St. John's, licensed for 501 beds, will probably have only 
150. "For us to rebuild as a 500-bed hospital would be a major mistake," said 
its president, Sister Marie Madeleine Shonka, adding that she expected the lost 
rooms to be replaced by a separate ambulatory care center. And its longtime 
rival four blocks away, the Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center, which also 
suffered quake damage and has excess capacity, has put out a friendly hand to 
see if cooperation can reduce costs and duplication of services. 
</P>
<P>
 A danger in all this is that the quest for efficiency will come at the expense 
of the community service and the caring traditionally provided by hospitals. 
For all its movie-celebrity aura, the 51-year-old St. John's -- operated by a 
Kansas-based Roman Catholic order, the Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth -- has 
an admirable history of charity. For example, it provides free surgery, 
obstetric care and laboratory work for the poor and homeless clients of the 
Venice Family Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes more sense to shape the future than fight it, to embrace economic 
realities than battle them. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste and inefficiency must be squeezed out and medicine compelled to obey the 
laws of economics. But as the hospitals move ahead, let not efficiency 
overwhelm community convenience and service, let not the need for black ink 
blot out compassion and charity. Hospitals in the future can accommodate harsh, 
new financial realities yet remain true to their noble origins.

GOOD SENSE IN THE WAKE OF TRAGEDY; U.S SAFETY BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESS 
TURBULENCE PROBLEMS OF 757S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board has made sound recommendations to the 
Federal Aviation Administration that ought to go far toward addressing 
longstanding concerns about the danger of wake turbulence associated with 
Boeing 757 jetliners. And the FAA should respond by moving with dispatch to 
implement them. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA late last year belatedly began requiring air traffic control towers to 
issue turbulence alerts to pilots following the big jets on approach to 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA had known earlier that 757 turbulence could raise havoc with planes 
too close behind. However, the alerts did not come until after a twin-engine 
jet following a 757 into John Wayne Airport crashed, killing five people. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, having studied the wake turbulence problem, now says that the 757 
needs to be treated as a weightier aircraft than it is and that minimum 
distances between landing airplanes must be lengthened. A change in weight 
classification would mean that most smaller planes would have to stay five 
miles back of 757s on approach, instead of the current three miles. That 
unfortunately could reduce the number of flights at an airport, but ultimately 
there can be no compromise on safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The board recommended, among other things, that 757s adhere to a standard 
flight path angle to avoid having trailing planes thrown out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations are not binding on the FAA, but they make a good deal of 
sense as a way to prevent accidents.

LERNER ON MIDEAST PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Michael Lerner ("It Was Israel's Optimists, Not Its Cynics, Who Changed 
History," Commentary, Feb. 11) is rejoicing prematurely. When the dust of 
Israel's incredible capitulation to Arab designs settles; when PLO terrorists 
dressed in "PLO police uniforms" roam Judea, Samaria and Gaza; when the 140,000 
Jewish residents of these territories are vulnerable to Arab massacre; when 
Arab "refugees" swarm into the territories as their first step toward regaining 
"Palestine," and when every city and town of Israel will once again be 
vulnerable to hostile Arab shells and missiles -- then we shall see who are the 
realists and who are the fools.

 * Lerner has missed the mark again. Among the many errors in his column: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jewish charity. Jewish commitment to the poor and oppressed has always 
continued unabated. It was never diminished by support for Israel, unless, of 
course, one interprets "poor and oppressed" to be equivalent to support for a 
Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jewish youth. Younger Jews seek "spiritual and moral truths outside of 
their Jewish heritage" because they have seen their Jewish parents fail to 
observe the religious and moral practices of Judaism, not because Jewish life 
has "increasingly focused on self-defense" or lost its commitment to the poor 
and oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Holocaust. It is necessary that the pain of the Holocaust be kept on 
the front burner as a reminder of what in fact happened and what we must not 
allow to happen again, not as Lerner states "to generate big bucks and blind 
loyalty to Israeli policies." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Jews have serious misgivings about the current Mideast peace process, but 
all of us pray for peace between Jews and Palestinians.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * A problem with Lerner's analysis is that by painting the organized Jewish 
community with a broad stroke he has misrepresented significant segments of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, representing some 860 Reform 
Jewish synagogues (about 1.5 million Jews) throughout North America has, over 
the years, adopted positions in support of territorial compromise by Israel and 
reconciliation by Israel of its security needs with the dignity, human rights 
and political rights of the Palestinians. These actions hardly comport with 
Lerner's depiction of the "organized Jewish community." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Lerner's assertion that Jewish commitment to the poor and the 
oppressed was replaced with a narrow focus on self-interest is simply contrary 
to the history of the Reform movement as well as that of numerous Jewish 
organizations. The Commission on Social Action of Reform Judaism has expressed 
its commitment to both the needs of the Jewish people and to poor and oppressed 
people of all backgrounds by facilitating synagogue involvement with programs 
focusing on hunger, homelessness, and needs of refugees (Jewish and 
non-Jewish). Our Religious Action Center in Washington has advocated for 
legislation to address problems of poverty and to assure the protection of 
human rights (e.g., rights of Syrian Jews to emigrate, anti-apartheid measures, 
gay and lesbian civil rights, and U.S. protection of Haitian refugees).

<P>
 * Not to detract from Lerner's optimistic article, but I must object to his 
depiction of Palestinians as terrorists. Twice Lerner refers to the indigenous 
Palestinians as "terrorists" while describing the invading Israeli colonists of 
occupied Palestine as "settlers." Semantics is not trivial: it reveals the 
individual's mind-set and perspective. The Palestinians who were born on the 
land and who are resisting occupation with violence are "the terrorists." The 
Israeli colonists who resort to equal violence to enforce their illegal 
occupation are "the settlers." The sophistry of those descriptions should be 
self-evident. Historically speaking, the oppressor obfuscates its oppression by 
transferring the blame and labeling its oppressed victims as hooligans, rebels 
and terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Lerner's contention that the world should be proud of Israel, I 
would maintain that the world should be proud of the Palestinian people. The 
Palestinian people, in the red-blooded American tradition of resisting tyranny, 
have triumphed over what Lerner describes as "one of the most powerful and 
sophisticated armies in the world" just as Americans, in our revolution, 
triumphed over the tyranny of the world's most powerful and sophisticated army, 
the English. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the lesson that Lerner claims Israel is teaching the world is not 
new; the two English peoples of the United States and the United Kingdom were 
subsequently able to reconcile and to become the staunchest of democratic 
allies. The two Semitic people of Israel and Palestine, hopefully, will be able 
to reconcile and become the staunchest of democratic allies.

CALIFORNIA'S GROWTH RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Demographers tell us they make projections, not predictions. Your editorial 
("A Demographic Lesson: Warnings about state population explosion missed the 
mark," Feb. 13) stated that demographer Leon Bouvier in 1991 projected a state 
population of 50 million by 2011. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouvier actually made three projections -- high, medium, and low. The figures 
you cited were from his high-level projections. His medium-level projection 
showed California reaching 50 million by 2016 and the low projection showed the 
state attaining that figure by 2040. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years California's population growth rate has exceeded that of 
India. When the Department of Finance last year released projections of the 
state's population increasing to 63 million by the year 2040, it noted that the 
current population was running 15 years ahead of its previous projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's lowered growth rate of "only 1.4%" means that, unlike 
industrialized countries with a stable population, California still continues 
to grow at the rate of a developing country and added another 442,000 residents 
to its population last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for this lower growth rate is a massive out-migration of 
Californians to other states, a net outflow of 252,000 last year. In the 
meantime both fertility rates and levels of foreign immigration have increased. 
Last year California absorbed a record 319,000 foreign immigrants. Because of 
the state's high fertility rates (higher than any industrialized nation in the 
world), a near record 375,000 were added to the state's population from the 
excess of births over deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 If California's economy rebounds and if there were a concomitant reversal in 
the flow of interstate migration, California's population would grow by a new 
record of nearly 1 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sad state of affairs where the only hope for restraining population 
growth is a further diminishment in the quality of life -- a diminishment 
effected in large part by the population growth itself.

 * At a growth rate of "only 1.4%" per year, a population will double in 50 
years. No country in the world has a sustainable economy, yet many people 
consider population growth and mass consumption to be acceptable. Do we owe 
anything at all to future generations?

 * The Times, in its coverage of the designation of 6.4 million acres of 
critical desert tortoise habitat, focused on the 1,000 acres in Ward Valley

A DIVA GOES TOO FAR AND SUFFERS A MERE MORTAL'S FATE; OPERA: THE TANTRUMS THAT 
GOT KATHLEEN BATTLE SACKED AT THE MET MAY BE ROOTED IN A TOO-RAPID RISE TO 
STARDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE KRISEL, Michelle Krisel, based in New York, manages the careers of 
opera singers and conductors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Battle's dismissal from the Metropolitan Opera this month was major 
news in every important American publication. The public was surprised, even if 
insiders were not. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the shock? After all, the world of opera is riven by treachery and 
tragedy, a world populated -- on stage and off -- by larger-than-life stars of 
fiery temperament. Tempers flare, egos are ruffled, stars are born. And, 
anyway, aren't divas supposed to be divas? 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cognoscenti have long clucked over Battle's escalating demands -- 
one joke had it that "if Kathy Battle married (pianist) Emmanuel Ax, we could 
call her Kathy Battle-Ax" -- much of the public was nonetheless upset to learn 
that an artist of such exquisite beauty, such delicate musical phrasing and 
such refined portrayals of the ingenue could be so nasty. Yet behavior that 
opera lovers affectionately forgive as part of being a diva would rightly be 
regarded as offensive and narcissistic by the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a long tradition at work here. Divas have been known to refuse to 
sing with a conductor if they disagree over a tempo, break a contract if they 
cannot abide a director's interpretation or plunge an opera management into 
administrative chaos over a last-minute cancellation owing to a soupcon of a 
cold. But, for the most part, such behavior always seemed to be in the service 
of art (or, at least, such was the conceit). The artist could not defame his 
beloved Verdi, say, by singing a phrase too slowly or too quickly, by updating 
the historical period in which the opera was originally set, by not serving the 
composer's intentions (at least insofar as the artist imagined them), by 
illness, however slight, or lack of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when divas seemed to compete with each other in the philosophy they 
espoused -- for instance, Maria Callas' credo that singing was about 
interpreting the soul of a character versus Renata Tebaldi's conviction that it 
was about being faithful to the beauty of the vocal line -- the rivalry seemed 
rooted in artistic differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Battle's recent difficulties, on the other hand, signal a new and alarming 
mutation. Rather than quarrel over artistic or musical matters, she fights over 
turf and power. For example, she has had tantrums over the size of her dressing 
room and the size of her limousine (when the limo that was sent to take her to 
President Clinton's inauguration struck her as insufficiently stretched, she 
refused to travel until a larger one was found). Insider cynics suspect that 
Battle's obsession with the size of dressing rooms and limos might be connected 
to the fact that among her peers in the opera pantheon, she possesses the 
smallest voice. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains odd that Battle should have so recklessly pushed her employer to so 
publicly denounce her. Perhaps the explanation lies in the rapidity with which 
she shot to stardom and her possible failure to emotionally prepare for it. The 
facts of her life are instructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Battle was born in 1948 in Portsmouth, Ohio, the seventh child of a 
steelworker originally from Alabama. When she wavered between studying math and 
pursuing music, her high school music teacher encouraged her to enroll at the 
Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati. In 1970, Battle received 
a bachelor's degree in music education; the following year she was awarded her 
master's. For the next two years, she taught music to inner-city elementary 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the fairy tale happened. Thomas Schippers, the renowned conductor of the 
Cincinnati Symphony, heard her and immediately engaged her to sing Brahms with 
the orchestra. Sometime later, she met fellow Cincinnatian James Levine, 
artistic director of the Met. Levine was, in his words, "blown away," and 
became Battle's mentor, coach and chief employer for the next 20 years. (Levine 
has so far been silent with regard to Battle's current troubles.) 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because Battle felt herself better prepared for teaching music than 
performing it, such a serendipitous career path and relatively sudden stardom 
at the most important opera house in America simply went to her head. (Battle 
once said, "I never would have dreamed of being a performance major.") It is, 
for many people, frightening to be at the top, and inner insecurity is often 
masked by an effort to belittle others.  
</P>
<P>
 This is an old and sad story, doubly sad to see it now being played out so 
publicly with so gifted a musician. Though opera ennobles and inspires us with 
grand tales of human suffering and achievement, it is nonetheless disappointing 
to find that the very Olympians who move us so can be as petty as we mortals.

CHIAPAS: 'THE CAUSE IS JUST'; EYEWITNESS: PAUL NADOLNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By * As told to Robert Scheer, Times Contributing Editor; Father Paul Nadolny, 
an American missionary in Chiapas, Mexico, visited Los Angeles last week as a 
representative of the Roman Catholic bishop of Chiapas, Don Samuel Ruiz Garcia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been working in the Diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas for four years. 
We hear a lot of criticism of the church in Chiapas. We've been blamed by the 
cattle barons and other large landowners, and by the state government for 
whatever conflict arises; we seem to be their scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened is that in the church we've taken seriously the documents of 
the Second Vatican Council and the documents produced by the bishops of Latin 
America. Around 1975, with the leadership of Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the 
church in Chiapas made a radical change, deciding that our mission is to be 
with the people, to live with them in their situation. Since then, we have 
organized communities led by catechists, lay Bible teachers drawn from the 
local population. So now the church is not so much the central temple in the 
town, but is instead centered in the small villages scattered throughout the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm living and working in the northern part of the state, an area where the 
cultural group is one of Mayan descent. And in the few years that I've been 
there, I've seen their suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 We've had cholera in our area, tuberculosis, yellow fever; most of the 
children have diarrhea because of malnutrition. The other day, there was a 
young indigenous couple in town. They have a small child who's dying of 
diarrhea and vomiting, so they bring the child to town. Well, they go to the 
doctor and the doctor charges 20 pesos, which is like two days' wages for them, 
just to see the child. Then the medicine they are prescribed is two or three 
times as much.  
</P>
<P>
 They are small farmers who work from sunup to the hottest part of the day to 
raise the corn and the beans that are the mainstay of the culture there. They 
farm in the hills -- in rocks! -- because the best land, the flat land, is 
where the big cattle ranches are. The indigenous people will have 
community-owned land, an ejido, and then little by little, through all kinds of 
methods that are so difficult to understand, the big landowners get the best 
land.  
</P>
<P>
 The small farmer raises his crop and he carries it down to his village on his 
back. Recently, he'd be getting about 80 centavos for 2 1/2 pounds. It's just 
horrendous, when you think that to buy a Coke, you pay a peso. So he gets less 
than a Coke for 2 1/2 pounds of hard-earned corn.  
</P>
<P>
 For the catechists, the Bible is their inspiration. So, with the word of God 
theyhave been inspired to look for ways of helping themselves. And it's 
incredible, the numerous ways it has sprung up -- the formation of small 
cooperatives and popular organizations, health promoters that teach about the 
herbs, preventive measures, hygiene, things that have come out of their desire 
to take care of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But self-help has its limits, and many, many forms of protest have also been 
springing up. Processions, protests, hunger strikes in the jails protesting 
human-rights violations. Then the repression comes, which is the answer from 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The high level of human-rights violations is a continuing, spiraling problem. 
It's mostly the impunity with which the government officials or the police can 
get away with things and are never brought to trial.  
</P>
<P>
 With the North American Free Trade Agreement coming into effect on Jan. 1, 
those taking up arms have apparently seen the insurrection as the only way out 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution, which deals with land ownership and 
land rights, was drastically reformed last year, and we think this was 
connected to the passage of NAFTA. The constitution, which was written in 1917 
by revolutionaries like Zapata and Pancho Villa, put in the ejido system, which 
meant that land would be divided among the indigenous people -- the farmers. 
Once ejido land was divided, it could not be sold, only passed on to another 
peasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they can sell their little plot of land. What happens is that when an 
Indian gets sick or his wife is sick, he'll do anything to cure her. I was with 
a sick person a couple of months ago, and his family said, "We had to sell so 
many hectares, so much of our land, to look for medicine and carry him to the 
hospital." Well, he died, and they're left without land.  
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA was part of that process of privatizing land. Well, this was seen by 
many people as the last straw. And evidently those who took up arms thought 
that there was no other way. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is against the violence. But the cause is just, and Don Ruiz has 
come out and said that we'll accompany those who have decided to take this 
route, although we do not agree with it. And we will continue to denounce the 
general injustice in Chiapas.

ONE HOSPITAL'S APPROACH: TRAIN PHYSICIANS FOR UNDERSERVED AREAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even those who can afford medical treatment often cannot find a primary-care 
doctor nearby. The need is especially great in low-income, largely Spanish 
speaking East Los Angeles, which the federal government has long designated a 
"health professions shortage area" having an inadequate number of physicians, 
nurses and other medical workers.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point,reports indicated that there was one primary-care doctor for 
every 4,000 people in East Los Angeles, twice the government's recommendation 
of one primary-care doctor for every 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the Boyle Heights-based White Memorial Medical Center responded with 
one of the country's first Family Practice Residency programs specifically 
tailored to prepare primary-care physicians to work in underserved areas like 
East Los Angeles. During three years of clinical education, residents receive 
Spanish-language instruction, information about building a medical practice in 
underserved communities and understanding ethnically based health-care 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 15 program graduates, 14 are board certified in family practice 
medicine; 12 are practicing in federally designated health professions shortage 
areas, with seven in East Los Angeles. SAMPLE OF FAMILY PRACTICE TRAINING 
</P>
<P>
 Over three years each resident's family medicine clincial training is also 
supplemented by specific instruction in: 
</P>
<P>
 How to find resources to subsidize care of indigent patients 
</P>
<P>
 How to introduce preventive health care or social services to patient's family 
</P>
<P>
 How to get involved in the community via outreach efforts including home 
health-care visits and regular school visits to discuss health-sciences careers 
and health-care issues ONE DOCTOR'S PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
<P>
 DR. MONICA LUGO 1991 graduate of White Memorial Medical Center's Family 
Practice Residency program; physician director of La Clinica Sunol, a community 
clinic in East Los Angeles operated by Alta-Med Health Services Co., Alhambra 
resident 
</P>
<P>
 I was born and raised in East Los Angeles and went to medical school at 
UC-Davis. I was interested in the Family Care Residency Program because all of 
the physicians involved had been my role models when I was in medical school. 
It was exciting to think about being in a group with attending physicians who 
were smart, had excellent experience, and backgrounds similar to me and that I 
would be in an environment that was like home. 
</P>
<P>
 A program like this makes other groups take a look and ask, "What are we doing 
about serving underserved communities?" Maybe they'll actively recruit faculty 
who are people of color and help emphasize how important it is to work long 
term within this setting. With a lot of residencies, the emphasis is that 
you'll learn from these patients, but then work in a middle-class or 
upper-middle class area -- a "respectable" community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Care Residency Program gives respect to people who work in 
underserved communities. Some people think that when you work in these 
communities you've given up so much you should be praised when, in many ways, 
it's an honor. We're lucky to be working here at home with people we feel 
comfortable with, with people who can trust us. It really bothers me when 
people try to put you on a pedestal because you're working in the inner city 
because it's not a sacrifice by any means -- it's where you want to be.  
</P>
<P>
 This is really where I belong. It's right down the street from where I went to 
junior high. It's where I'm comfortable. It's home. TO GET INVOLVED

LAKERS GET THE JUMP ON 76ERS AS CHRISTIE RETURNS FROM INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The game was, for all practical purposes, over, the Lakers headed to a 107-95 
victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday night at the Forum, when the most 
important play occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Christie, sidelined for 16 games because of a sprained ankle, was 
charging down the right side alone on a fast break. James Worthy had the ball 
along the left side. He lobbed. Christie caught the ball and turned it into an 
alley-oop dunk. He then landed without any pain in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't been jumping in practice or warm-ups, so I didn't know how well I 
could jump," Christie said. "But he threw it up and I went and got it. I 
wouldn't say I'm back 100%, but that was definitely a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 Much as his return before 11,662 was a bonus as the Lakers ended a three-game 
losing streak behind 21 points from Sedale Threatt and 19 points, seven 
rebounds, six assists and four steals from Nick Van Exel. Christie? He had four 
points and three rebounds and four turnovers in 21 mostly rusty minutes, many 
in a glimpse of what could be a move to shooting guard, but the numbers didn't 
matter in comparison to the fact that he was finally back. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ankle is still tender and, he estimates, at about 75% strength, 
Christie played without pain, even making harder cuts as the game progressed. 
However, he did jam a joint in the first half and had to be re-taped. 
</P>
<P>
 "His timing was off," Worthy said. "He hasn't had enough practice time. You 
could see that from the way he handled the ball, but that's only natural when 
you're coming back from that kind of layoff. I think he's about a game away." 
</P>
<P>
 Christie was in uniform Friday at Phoenix and apparently ready to play, but 
was held out of the eventual loss and said he should have stayed home to get 
therapy instead of sitting on the bench.  
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he made it in at the start of the second quarter, his first appearance 
since Jan. 9, the day before suffering a sprained ankle in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 His nine minutes that quarter were primarily at shooting guard, which might 
become a common sight. George Lynch has taken over the small forward spot by 
averaging 16.2 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.06 steals in the 16 games Christie 
sat out. 
</P>
<P>
 That -- combined with Anthony Peeler expected to be out at least two more 
weeks because of a stress fracture in a leg and Christie saying that off guard 
is his natural position -- makes for a potential long-term move. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Christie returned again, opening the fourth quarter after sitting 
out the third, the Lakers were on their way to turning the game into a blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 79-70 at the time, but about to become 87-70 while the 76ers went 
scoreless for five minutes. The lead extended to 101-80 with 4:34 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring 60 points before intermission, the 76ers managed only 10 points 
in the third quarter while making five of 20 shots and 25 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35 points represented the fewest the Lakers have given up in a half this 
season. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 James Worthy said he is considering retiring after this season, his 12th, 
which would mean either a buyout of the final two years of his contract or 
walking away from a $7.2-million balloon payment for 1994-95. "I haven't 
seriously, seriously thought about it," Worthy said before Sunday's game. " . . 
. I'm going to give the season all the attention it deserves and I don't think 
I'll be talking about it before every game. I haven't had any personal contact 
about it with the front office." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Smith, the current starter at shooting guard, played six minutes the 
first half, didn't open the third quarter and got only two more minutes the 
rest of the way. Coach Randy Pfund continues to consider replacing him with 
Sedale Threatt, although Pfund might stay with Smith for one more game, 
Thursday at Sacramento, to have his best backcourt defender to use against 
Mitch Richmond. "I'll evaluate it," Pfund said. "Maybe I'll give Sedale a look 
and see how he does as a starter for a couple of games. It's a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Christie was the team's leading scorer before falling to No. 2 by the end 
of the night.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; HOPES GO OFF COURSE; ALPINE SKIING: PARISIEN 
IS DISQUALIFIED DURING DOWNHILL SEGMENT OF COMBINED. STREET IS SECOND, WITH 
SLALOM HEATS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stream of American success stories in these Olympics runs dry, for now, at 
Julie Parisien, the U.S. skier who most needs success. 
</P>
<P>
 While she had hoped to borrow some U.S. glow from Tommy Moe and Picabo Street, 
Sunday brought another run of bad luck for Parisien, who went off course in the 
women's downhill combined at Kvitfjell, disqualifying her from today's slalom 
segment. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien has five days to bounce back for her one remaining event, Saturday's 
women's slalom. Once, she had the swagger of a medal contender. Now, it would 
be enough to stop the emotional bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope I can be in there so people don't forget about me," Parisien 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined downhill was a repeat of Saturday's medal finish in women's 
regular downhill, with Germany's Katja Seizinger winning, followed by Street 
and Isolde Kostner of Italy. Because of rule changes that now heavily weigh in 
favor of the slalom segment, however, it is unlikely that Sunday's leader board 
will remain intact.  
</P>
<P>
 The medalists probably will emerge from among several gate specialists who 
finished well within striking distance: Slovenia's Alenka Dovzan, who was 
fourth, Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, fifth; Italy's Morena Gallizio, sixth, and 
Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiberg, for example, finished 1.42 seconds behind Seizinger in the downhill, 
but can expect to beat the German downhiller by as many as four seconds in two 
slalom runs today at Hafjell. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien, from Sugar Loaf, Me., had been among the top skiers in combined 
training this week, raising hopes that she could, at last, put this miserable 
stretch behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien had posted the 12th-fastest time after the second interval but 
carried too much speed into a turn and swung wide right, nearly clipping a 
retaining fence. She avoided real disaster but could not get back on line and 
ended up missing a gate. 
</P>
<P>
 In that instant, the self-doubt resurfaced, the haunting memories of her 
tragic year, which begin Dec. 17, 1992, the day her brother, Jean-Paul, was 
killed in a car accident. He wasn't only the skier's brother, he was her 
emotional stability. Had he lived, J.P.'s would have been the first shoulder 
Julie would have leaned on after Sunday's disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates have tried to fill the void. Street, with her 50,000-watt 
personality, offered Parisien a pat on the back and words of encouragement. But 
Parisien was sinking fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Maybe this isn't for me anymore,' " Street recalled of the 
exchange. "And I said, 'Yeah it is, man. It's still your sport, totally. You've 
just got find it again, and you've got to keep that tiger alive.' And she 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien, at 22, has won more World Cup races -- three -- than all other 
members of the U.S. ski team combined, men and women. But she has regressed 
noticeably since last February, when she claimed the silver medal in slalom at 
the World Championships in an emotional moment dedicated to her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 In a break from team policy last summer, Parisien was allowed to train 
separately with a personal coach, Rob Clayton. But the plan was scrapped in 
December because of poor race results. She began the 1992-93 season as the 
world's top-ranked slalom skier, but the best she could offer this season was 
an eighth-place slalom finish at Altenmarkt, Austria, in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien remains positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't whine about it," she said. "Your results, you bring them on 
yourselves. I don't know. It's been really tough for me this year. I've been 
fighting a lot. It gets to the point where you just get tired. Right now, I'm 
up. I'm up for these Olympics, of course. We've won so much so far. It's hard 
not to be. But I've been a little tired all year, always fighting this 
self-doubt. That's the worst feeling an athlete can go through, ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien is trying to draw from the success of her teammates, particularly 
Street, who took the silver in Saturday's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 But watching others succeed sometimes adds extra pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can work both ways," Parisien said.  
</P>
<P>
 Street is determined to keep Parisien upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got to keep fighting, keep herself positive," Street said, "Because 
she's skiing tremendously. I haven't seen her ski this well all year. And now 
she wants to dive, she wants to go down in the rut, and I'm going to try my 
hardest not to let her. Because she's just starting to get it back together and 
she needs to keep that confidence, and I'm going to try and help her, because 
she's a great girl and she's been through a lot, and she's one of the best 
skiers out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Street, still aglow in her Olympic moment, had to put Sunday's second-place 
finish in perspective. Before this season, combined champions were determined 
with a complicated formula that -- although fairer perhaps -- left spectators 
in varied states of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 To simplify it, the times of downhill and two slalom runs are now combined, 
giving a decided advantage to slalom skiers, who can make up more time in their 
events than downhillers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to give it my best shot," Street said. "I haven't trained a whole 
lot of slalom, but I'm just going to wing it. Usually I ski well under those 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Winging it probably best describes the attitude of the U.S. Alpine team, which 
has already won two gold medals and two silver.

HEBERT SECOND-BEST TO BLUES' JOSEPH AGAIN, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a day Guy Hebert will remember as "bittersweet." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday morning, Hebert became a No. 1 goalie for the first time in his NHL 
career when his buddy Ron Tugnutt was traded to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost a partner," Hebert told Tugnutt, giving him a playful hug as they 
walked through a dank hallway in St. Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night, Hebert started for the Mighty Ducks in a 4-1 loss to the St. 
Louis Blues, the team for which he was a backup for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Another old buddy, Blues' All-Star goalie Curtis Joseph, showed the form that 
rendered Hebert a backup when Hebert was here. Joseph made 42 saves and held 
the Ducks to a goal by Terry Yake at 14:39 of the second period, with the Blues 
already leading, 2-0.  
</P>
<P>
 The comeback was stopped cold when the Blues scored on the very next shift, on 
Vitali Prokhorov's goal at 14:58. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Miller got the Blues off to a good start when he scored his 20th goal of 
the season at 4:03 of the first after Hebert tried to poke-check the puck away 
with Miller closing in on a breakaway chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guy half-fanned on a clearing attempt and the guy scores from a 
near-impossible angle," Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Janney made the score 2-0 with a goal at 7:02. 
</P>
<P>
 "There they pick up a puck off a dump-in and we blew our coverage there," 
Wilson said. "There again, Guy makes a good play and he pokes the puck off the 
guy's skate into the net. We weren't getting a lot of breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Shanahan's 36th goal closed out the Blues' scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert's day was filled with ambivalent feelings about the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured we made it through the season this far, I didn't think either one 
of us thought anything was going to really change the rest of the year," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Still) this is something I've worked for for a long time, and it's a big 
vote of confidence by the organization. I'm happy being here and happy to get 
the chance to play a lot of games now."

 The Clippers shouldn't have fined Ron Harper for running off his mouth. I'm a 
believer in free speech. Leave it to the other clubs in the NBA to hurt him in

 News item: Arizona Coach Lute Olson, after his Wildcats beat UCLA, said: ". .

Conference race) in a tie." Reaction: Right, Lute. Just like things tend to 
tighten up when you know a first-round loss would put you out of the NCAA 
tournament. . . .

 How come Dean Smith isn't getting heat for all those losses suffered by

 Gabriel Ruelas had some advice for younger brother Rafael. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Give it everything you have because you never know when you'll get another 
chance to fight for the title," he said. . . . A year ago Sunday, Gabe lost a 
close decision to World Boxing Council junior- 
</P>
<P>
 lightweight champion Azumah Nelson in Mexico City. One of the judges had the 
fight even. Ruelas still hasn't been able to get a rematch although he is 
ranked No. 1. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at the Forum, Rafael made the most of his opportunity, climbing 
off the canvas twice in the first round to win a unanimous, 12-round decision 
over Freddie Pendleton for the International Boxing Federation lightweight 
title. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest roar of the night from the 10,333 fans came when ring announcer 
Michael Buffer said, "The winner and new. . . . " . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Persistence, a fighting spirit, and superb conditioning brought Rafael, 22, 
the championship 10 years after he and his brother stepped into the Ten Goose 
Boxing Gym in Van Nuys. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Only a year and five pounds separate Gabe and Rafael, who often work out 
together. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I sparred a few rounds with Rafael about a month ago," Gabe said. "But I told 
Joe (trainer Joe Goossen) to get somebody else. Rafael was hitting too hard for 
me.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas and Pendleton stole the show from the much-anticipated rematch between 
Michael Carbajal and Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The rumble in Las Vegas 11 months ago, won by Carbajal on a knockout in the 
seventh round, was not repeated by two warriors who had grown cautious. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was a tough fight to score because there was nothing close to a knockdown 
and there was a contrast in styles -- Gonzalez running the first four rounds 
and then moving in and out, and Carbajal coming straight in, but without 
throwing many punches. I scored it even. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, both benefited financially from the split decision awarded Gonzalez. 
Only against each other can these 108-pounders make big money, and now a third 
match is being planned for Las Vegas in May or June. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Golfer Scott Hoch and actor Jerry (Beaver Cleaver) Mathers. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 They won't be the same old Milwaukee Brewers now that Robin Yount, who played 
21 years with them, and Jim Gantner, who played 15, are retired, and Paul 
Molitor, who played 15, is about to start his second season with the Toronto 
Blue Jays. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I've never read about a big league prospect having a so-so Winter League 
season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former UCLA wide receiver Kurt Altenberg, who caught the touchdown pass from 
Gary Beban that beat USC in 1965, received a heart transplant at UCLA Medical 
Center on Thursday. . . .

 "I feel like a million bucks, and I'll be back home Wednesday," said 
Altenberg, 50, who has a marketing company. . . .

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; LESLIE DOMINATES IN LEADING USC TO VICTORY OVER ARIZONA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lisa Leslie spearheaded USC's 85-63 victory over Arizona on Sunday before 920 
at the Lyon Center, the Trojans' 12th Pacific 10 Conference victory and 18th 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing 32 minutes, the 6-foot-5 Leslie had 32 points, 12 rebounds, six 
assists and three steals as USC won its second in a row since a 63-55 loss at 
Washington last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Cheryl Miller's team, ranked seventh, maintained a two-game conference 
lead over Stanford and Oregon, each 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
 USC and Arizona entered the game without key athletes. Trojan point guard 
Nicky McCrimmon returned to Los Angeles at midday Sunday, after attending her 
mother's funeral in New York. Arizona (5-7) lost leading scorer Shawn Coder to 
a season-ending knee injury last week. And Coach Joan Bonvicini suspended 
starting guard Brenda Pantoja for breaking a team rule Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
 USC gained a 29-10 lead early, with Leslie and freshman Tina Thompson leading 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Karleen Shields gave the Trojans a 38-17 lead in the first half on Leslie's 
sensational assist. 
</P>
<P>
 USC lost much of a 47-31 halftime lead because of some sloppy passing, but 
Arizona could get no closer than nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans buried the Wildcats with a 13-0 run near the game's end, with 
Leslie and Thompson each scoring nine. EARL GUSTKEY

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NOTEBOOK; TORVILL AND DEAN EVOKE MEMORIES OF

<P>
 Torvill and Dean brought their passion and perfection back to Olympic ice 
dancing Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing a sexy rumba filled with quick steps and flowing spins, Jayne 
Torvill and Christopher Dean of Britain rekindled memories of a decade ago, 
when they redefined the event at the Sarajevo Games.They received two perfect 
6.0 marks for presentation, from Britain and Ukraine, and set up a three-way 
contest for gold tonight in the free dance. 
</P>
<P>
 World champions Maia Usova and Alexander Zhulin were second, followed by 
fellow Russians Oksana Gritschuk and Evgeny Platov. Both couples had tied for 
first in the compulsory dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the free dance, worth 50% of the total score, Torvill and Dean 
are tied with Usova and Zhulin. Gritschuk and Platov are third. Whoever wins 
tonight will take the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a challenge," Dean said with obvious relief. "It feels good being 
10 years away and still being competitive with the best of the world."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; IT'S V FOR VICTORY FOR GERMANY'S WEISSFLOG; 
SKI JUMPING: THE 1984 GOLD MEDALIST EDGES FELLOW VETERAN BREDESEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Youth was served handsomely only two years ago in Olympic ski jumping, but 
Sunday was old-timers' day on the large hill here. 
</P>
<P>
 German Jens Weissflog and Norwegian Espen Bredesen, a couple of veterans who 
had to change styles in mid-career when the V-technique became all the rage a 
few years ago, dueled on a sunny day at the Lysgardsbakkene ski jumping arena, 
the Olympic venue that dominates the scene here. 
</P>
<P>
 Weissflog, 29, who last won Olympic gold at Sarajevo in 1984, when the German 
Democratic Republic was still the polite name for his country, East Germany, 
and a unified country was the farthest thing from any German's mind, uncorked a 
stylish second jump of 436 feet 4 inches off the 120-meter slide and beat out 
Bredesen, 26, the favorite.  
</P>
<P>
 Austrian Andreas Goldberger, baby-faced and apple-cheeked at 21, upheld the 
honor of the youth brigade by taking the bronze. But nothing was heard from the 
teen-age stars of the Albertville Games, Toni Nieminen of Finland and Martin 
Hoellwarth of Austria, simply because they weren't good enough to make their 
Olympic teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toni grew up this much (six inches) and has had trouble finding the right 
balance," said the Finnish delegation's Matti Salmenkyla of Nieminen, who won 
two golds and a bronze at Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Weissflog and Bredesen, who have been battling all season on the 
World Cup circuit, carried on in that tradition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 First it was Bredesen, soaring 444 feet 6 inches, the longest jump of the day, 
in the first round, knocking Weissflog out of the lead he had given himself 12 
jumpers earlier with a leap of 424 feet 10 inches. Bredesen's landing was less 
than perfect, but his hill-record leap left him with a 10-point lead before the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first jump was a good jump," Bredesen said. "Not a super jump but a good. 
I had a little wind and that helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither had any appreciable lifting wind in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Weissflog's big effort -- the length and style on his second jump were worth 
140.4 points and gave him a two-jump total of 274.5 -- gave Bredesen something 
to shoot at and he came up short, soaring 400 feet 3 inches and settling for a 
total of 266.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberger, 1993 World Cup champion, finished with jumps of 421-7 and 398-7, 
good for 255 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first jump was really very good," Weissflog said. "It was not ideal, 
compared to Espen's, but the second one was even better. After the first round, 
I thought it would be impossible to catch up -- but there's always a second 
round." 
</P>
<P>
 Weissflog actually won two medals in '84, the gold on the normal hill and the 
silver on the big. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering that I won this one on the big hill, I'd have to say today is the 
most important victory of my career," Weissflog said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many years ago, there were serious questions whether Weissflog would 
compete again in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish jumper Jan Boklov pioneered the V-style in 1985, spreading the tips of 
his skis while keeping the tails together. In the classical style, the jumper 
kept his skis parallel and leaned over them while in the air. Boklov's new 
style drew gibes at first, but gradually other skiers tried it and by 1989, 
after it had been shown that the V funneled more lifting air onto the jumper's 
chest -- resulting in longer jumps -- it was being touted as the wave of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Young jumpers took to it readily, not so those who grew up keeping their skis 
together. Both Weissflog and Bredesen, who had been hailed as Norway's next 
great jumper, were caught in the switches and the young lions had their day at 
Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to change before the last Olympics, but it takes at least a year to 
get it right," Bredesen said. "It's hard to change. But I've had a couple of 
years now and it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Weissflog's adjustment was apparently even more difficult.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had many problems and I doubted that I could make the change at all," he 
said. "Even last year, in the V-style, I was not very stable. But this year I 
feel I have really mastered it."

 Given the recent death of teammate Ulrike Maier, killed in a Jan. 29 downhill 
crash, the Austrian women might be forgiven for their lackluster performances. 
</P>
<P>
 American Julie Parisien, who has found it difficult to ski since the death of 
her brother more than a year ago, said she understands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been really tough on them," Parisien said. "Every time they're in 
the start gate, I'm sure they're thinking about Ulli. Every time I'm in there 
I'm thinking, 'Wow, did Ulli talk to these people before she went down? Did she 
click into her bindings the same way?' " All this goes through your head, 
because she was so close to all of us."

 Russian Sergei Tarasov missed three shots but skied well enough to offset that 
deficiency and won the men's 20-kilometer biathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 Biathlon combines target shooting with cross-country skiing and in the 20K, 
the athletes shoot four times, twice each from the prone and standing 
positions.Each miss from 50 meters with the .22-caliber rifle brings a 
one-minute penalty, which is added to the racer's time. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarasov's winning time was 57 minutes 25.3 seconds, which put him 3.4 seconds 
ahead of Germany's Frank Luck, the second-to-last starter in a field of 70, in 
one of the closest finishes in Olympic history. Luck also missed three shots.  
</P>
<P>
 Third was another German, Sven Fischer, in 57:41.9, with two misses.  
</P>
<P>
 Patrice Bailly-Salins of France, the World Cup leader, finished more than two 
minutes behind in 13th place.

 What has become of Austria, Switzerland and France -- all Alpine countries -- 
in Alpine skiing? 
</P>
<P>
 At the Olympic halfway point, skiers from those countries have no medals.

<P>
 In medals, the United States leads the big three, four to none.

 "The expectations are difficult (for the Alpine countries)," said Patrick 
Lang, a free-lance journalist who serves as a translator for the World Cup 
circuit and the Olympic Games. "For America, ski racing is not ranked in the 
top 20 sports in the U.S. Skiing only exists for the Olympics. I think the 
American spirit is, 'Let's go for the win, there's nothing to lose. Let's have 
fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To many Europeans, ski racing is a year-round passion, and the Olympics are 
merely a stop on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the World Cup, it's a game where anything can happen, and it's good, 
it's fun, but you have to put everything into perspective," Lang said. "It's an 
Olympics. It doesn't mean anything before and it doesn't mean anything after." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially if you don't win anything.

 U.S. bobsled Coach Joey Kilburn wasn't specifically addressing the failed 
attempt to replace Randy Jones with Jeff Woodard as the pusher on Brian 
Shimer's two-man sled, but he said there is a need to change the rules that 
thwarted the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the number of sports where the coach has the discretion to make a 
move in the best interest of the team," he said."Right now, we're handcuffed. 
We can't make a change unless there's an injury or the athlete agrees to step 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to emphasize to the board of the federation and the USOC that we need 
to have that leeway. We should be able to make a change based on hard facts."

 Patrik Juhlin's hat trick in Sweden's 6-4 victory over the United States on 
Saturday had reporters wondering why Juhlin, a sturdy right wing who was 
drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in 1989, had never come over to the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 So was Juhlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have interest, if they want me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They might want him, but getting a release from his Swedish club, Vasteras, is 
another matter. NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke said that as general 
manager of the Vancouver Canucks, he tried unsuccessfully to get the release of 
Leif Rohlin, Juhlin's teammate with Vasteras and the Swedish Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're notorious for being difficult about letting players go," Burke said. 
"When we tried to get Rohlin, they asked for a transfer fee of $500,000, U.S. I 
told them they were out of their minds. The management there has changed, 
though, so things might be different now."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; IT'S CRUNCH TIME; U.S., ITALY FACE OFF IN 
HOCKEY TODAY WITH BERTH IN QUARTERFINALS AT STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not every Olympic hockey player from Massachusetts dreamed Sunday that the 
United States would defeat Italy here today to advance to the tournament's 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Medford's David Delfino, who left home six years ago to play in the Italian 
League, dreamed of recording the biggest upset in his adopted country's hockey 
history, knowing he will have to disappoint some of his childhood friends to 
achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States (0-1-3) needs a tie or victory today to earn the final Group 
B playoff berth, and it faces no sure thing against Italy, 1-3-0 and seeded 
eighth. Although Italy has never won an Olympic hockey medal -- its best finish 
was seventh place as host of the 1956 Cortina Games -- the Italians have a 
scrappy team here and will look to Delfino today to solidify a sometimes shaky 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to it," said Delfino, whose 32-save performance Saturday 
in a 7-3 romp over France put Italy in position for its first medal-round berth 
ever. "I'm sure I'll be a little more anxious than usual, anxious but under 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Controlling his emotions while surrounded by a pro-U.S. crowd at Haakon Hall 
could be the key for Delfino. "When they start that chanting, 'USA! USA!' I'm 
going to implant it in David's mind that they're saying, 'Del-fi-no!' so he 
doesn't think he's Benedict Arnold stopping the puck against them," said Bill 
Hughes, Italy's goaltending coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Said U.S. center David Sacco, who grew up with Delfino in Medford: "I know him 
real well, and it's going to be a little weird to be playing against him. But 
it's for our country right now and for our pride, so we're going to go out and 
play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Tim Taylor acknowledged Delfino is hot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get scared by a hot goaltender," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to announce his own goaltender, but it's likely to be Garth Snow 
because Snow is three years older than Mike Dunham and has more international 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to keep the goaltending decision away from Italy," he said. "They 
(sent two assistant coaches to) our practice and if they want to play that 
little cat-and-mouse game, I'm going to play it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 He played no such games with his players Sunday. Usually expressionless behind 
the bench and professorial during practices, Taylor was angry and vocal Sunday, 
at one point halting a passing drill to criticize their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to win a goddamned medal here!" he shouted. "Get your heads out of 
your . . . and pass the puck." 
</P>
<P>
 His volume and his vehemence surprised his players, even after six months with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't yell that much, so you know when he speaks up, he really means 
it," winger Jim Campbell said. "He wants us to get intense and remind us we 
can't just turn it on and off."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; THE FORCE IS WITH SWISS BOBSLEDDERS; 
TWO-MAN: WEDER COMES FROM BEHIND TO DEFEAT COUNTRYMAN FOR GOLD. U.S. TEAMS ARE 
13TH AND 14TH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gustav Weder is not a Swiss watchmaker. The clock is in his head, the 
precision in his driving and preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old physical education teacher proved it again Sunday, coming from 
behind in the fourth and final heat to defeat countryman Reto Goetschi by 0.05 
seconds and repeat his 1992 victory in two-man bobsled. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 20 Olympic, World Cup and European medals for the man who rules this 
empire under the nickname of Darth because it's Weder, as in Vader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're competitive with him in the training runs, then he brings something out 
on race day," said Jim Herberich, the driver of USA I. "If we could find out 
what it is, we'd be there with him, but it's kind of frustrating to see such a 
large difference."  
</P>
<P>
 Herberich and Chip Minton were 14th, 0.56 seconds behind Brian Shimer and 
Randy Jones, who were 13th, more than two seconds behind Weder, who has won 
almost all of those medals in sleds he has built himself, a technical yardstick 
for the U.S. drivers, developers and investors as they attempt to take their 
Bo-Dyn sleds to a higher level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because the sled has had a lot of publicity, that isn't necessarily the 
thing that didn't come through for us," Harvard engineer Herberich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many other factors, like the starts, the driving, the level of 
competition. I think the sled itself is great. I wouldn't change anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's probably the fastest out here, and what it comes down to now is 
more research and development on the runners (the steel rails on which the sled 
rides)." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a four-year project we tried to condense to two," he said of the 
one-plus year that the Bo-Dyns have been on the ice since NASCAR driver Geoff 
Bodine spearheaded development of the first U.S.-made sleds since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crew (from IBM and Chassis Dynamics in Connecticut) has done an 
unbelievable job getting them ready," Shimer said. "I wish I had done better 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 He still could. He holds the track record here in four-man, next weekend's 
concluding event of the Olympics. He also had the fifth-fastest time in the 
third heat Sunday, a measure of his and Jones' championship form in the 1992-93 
World Cup tour, after he had finished seventh with Herschel Walker in the '92 
Olympic two-man. 
</P>
<P>
 The inconsistency of his four runs in the two-man here characterized an 
admittedly difficult season in which he has: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Battled injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Adjusted to a new sled and driving coach after the U.S. federation was 
unable to reach contract terms with his mentor, Meinhard Nehmer.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Questioned the dedication of sledmates.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Attempted to change pushers on the eve of Olympic two-man. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Been accused of theft by a former teammate in a federal lawsuit that was 
recently withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tough year," Shimer said. "I fell off a little, and 10 or so other teams came 
on. I haven't been as focused because of the distractions and my driving hasn't 
been as good without Meinhard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish he was still around, but it's up to me to make myself better. I've 
been disappointed with the work ethic, as I've said before, but I include 
myself in that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also look at that time in the third heat and feel that with the Bo-Dyns, we 
have a lot of potential to tap into. 
</P>
<P>
 "People forget this was a whole new steering system and we had to do all of 
our testing in competition. I mean, you can simulate all you want, but you 
eventually have to do it on ice, and we don't have the facilities in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Joey Kilburn: "What we've done with the Bo-Dyns in a year or two is 
unheard of in the bobsled community. We've made tremendous inroads. I hate to 
get into percentages, but I'd say the sleds are 95%. Whether that other 5% 
rests with the runners or modifying the aerodynamics remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 They could ask Weder, but he probably wouldn't help them. Even countryman 
Goetschi has to build his own. He had a lead of 0.03 seconds before the final 
heat, but clocked 52.93 compared to 52.85 for Weder, whose pusher, Donat 
Acklin, is the older brother of Guido Acklin, who pushes for Goetschi. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's Gunther Huber won the bronze, which follows the gold and silver his 
brothers, Willfried and Norbert, won in luge doubles. Another brother, Arnold, 
finished fourth in luge singles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers have now won 43 Olympic, World Cup and European medals as the first 
family of sliding. And even Weder would have to concede that title to them.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; REESE'S RETURN LIFTS TEAM SPIRIT

<P>
 He walked gingerly through the clubhouse door early Sunday morning in Tempe, 
Ariz., and the moment he stepped inside, heads turned and players rushed 
eagerly toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Reese, 92, was back for his 78th season of professional baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 "It means more than everything to see him back today," pitcher Mark Langston 
said. "Everything we do is meaningless compared to seeing Jimmie. I can't begin 
to tell you how much we missed him last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, the Angels' conditioning coach, was hospitalized in 1993 and remained 
too weak to rejoin the Angels, missing the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just hoping and praying that things would work out all right," Reese 
said, "but when get to 92, you begin to wonder. When I die, I want to go with 
this uniform on. This is my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Said rookie pitcher Troy Percival: "If I never make it to the big leagues, 
it's all been worth it just being able to meet that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While there were no more than a couple of dozen fans who attended the Angels' 
first workout, they got a treat when Bo Jackson arrived four days early. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson not only captivated the crowd with his exploits in the batting cage -- 
hitting a ball to the fence with his first swing -- but he completely 
overwhelmed Preston Gomez, Angel assistant to the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to see Bo," Gomez said. "I had hip replacement surgery two years ago, 
and I can't believe for the life of me that someone could play baseball with an 
artificial hip. That's absolutely amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who is expected to be a reserve left fielder and first baseman and 
designated hitter, said Sunday, "I'm just out here trying to win a job," but 
Manager Buck Rodgers knows better. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of his mind, he feels like he's going to be an everyday player," 
Rodgers said, "so we'll see what happens. We don't know whether last year was 
an experimental year or not. We might have got a bargain or gotten a bust. 
We're going to have to wait and see like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the season were to open today, Rodgers said his bullpen would consist of 
Joe Grahe, Mike Butcher, Craig Lefferts, Bob Patterson and Scott Lewis. "I 
wouldn't be afraid to send any of those five out there to get the last out," 
Rodgers said, "and that's the first time I could ever say that about my entire 
bullpen." BOB NIGHTENGALE

LOST WEEKEND FOR U.S. AS SWEDEN WINS, 3-1; SOCCER: AMERICANS LOSE CONFIDENCE IN 
THEMSELVES AND COACH'S SYSTEM AFTER POOR SHOWING IN MIAMI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lasting image of Sunday's U.S.-Sweden soccer game was of Henrik Larsson 
racing alone toward the American goal, dreadlocks slapping his back, as, in the 
distance, one or two U.S. defenders gave desperate chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parts of the U.S. national soccer team were in reverse during and after 
its 3-1 loss to Sweden in the Joe Robbie Cup. In the weekend's two games, the 
United States all but erased the memory of an organized and cohesive defensive 
back line that had emerged only weeks before. The United States and Boliva 
tied, 1-1, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also backpedaling was U.S. assistant coach Timo Liekoski, whose glowing review 
of the defense before the tournament lost its credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The final, and most serious, reversal was the players' confidence in Coach 
Bora Milutinovic's system, and his constant experimenting with players and 
positions. Milutinovic thought the players had finally embraced his 
build-from-the-back philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Struggling is a good word," said defender Desmond Armstrong. "It's a matter 
of being comfortable with the players around you. The problems we have stem 
from a lack of communication. Honestly, it's a matter of some players playing 
out of position. It's a matter of finding out who is the leader out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong acknowledged that he was pulled out of position on Sweden's first 
goal by Larsson. But his point was more about the general confusion that 
controls the movements of the back four U.S. players. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the return of Marcelo Balboa from a serious knee injury, Armstrong has 
been bounced from the sweeper position to various other defensive spots. 
Milutinovic is also tinkering with the halfback position and moving players 
freely in the back. The result is players are moving forward when they 
shouldn't, and there is uncertainty about positions and roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a discrepancy between what we should and should not do, we'll have to 
get it sorted out," said U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who was under assault 
against Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States scored first on a left-footed shot from Hugo Perez, who was 
the team's bright spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden took the lead before the half, on a goal from Kennet Andersson that was 
set up by Larsson. Larsson assisted on Sweden's third goal, which illustrated 
the Americans' defensive breakdown. Larsson found Andersson breaking into the 
area and sent a perfect pass. Friedel, alone, came out to challenge and 
Andersson chipped a shot over the diving keeper.  
</P>
<P>
 Sweden won the tournament, topping Colombia on goal differential. Colombia 
defeated Bolivia, 2-0, on Sunday before 20,171. 
</P>
<P>
 Liekoski gingerly retracted his earlier compliments and agreed with the 
players that leadership on the field is missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lack the one guy who is going to grab the guys by the neck and say 'Let's 
get going.' If you listen carefully when we play, there's not a lot of 
chatter." 
</P>
<P>
 The damage control is only now beginning.

<P>
 Park Chan Ho took center stage again Sunday, throwing in front of several 
Dodger officials, including President Peter O'Malley, at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who has a high leg kick in his delivery, communicated with pitching 
coach Ron Perranoski through interpreter Don Yi, who is staying with Park 
throughout spring training.When Park finished throwing, he walked over and 
bowed to his catcher in thanks. "His curveball has outstanding rotation and he 
kicked his fastball up another gear," Perranoski said. "His leg kick is fine as 
long as he doesn't do it with men on base. It's like Juan Marichal's was. 
Yesterday he kicked the top of the net." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Park was throwing, Rudy Seanez threw unnoticed nearby. Seanez was the 
one who drew the crowd two springs ago, when he threw one time before being 
sidelined for the season because of a back condition. He split last season 
between the Colorado Rockies and the San Diego Padres, and was signed by the 
Dodgers during the off-season to a minor league contract. . . . Fred Claire, 
executive vice president, said Todd Worrell threw well and had no problems with 
his previously injured arm. MARYANN HUDSON

NBA ROUNDUP; KNICKS HOLD BULLS TO A SEASON-LOW 68 POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Pat Riley said it was the way the New York Knicks need to play to win a 
championship -- claw for every rebound and loose ball and shut down the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Coach Phil Jackson said it was the kind of game that will turn fans 
off to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to get after them, and right from the get-go we got after them 
defensively," Riley said after the Knicks opened a 22-point halftime lead and 
cruised to an 86-68 victory over the Bulls at New York on Sunday. "Defensively, 
we got done what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The 68 points were a season low for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley dominated inside in the Knicks' big first 
half. Ewing had 11 of his 20 points and 11 of his 18 rebounds and Oakley all of 
his 10 points and 10 of his 13 rebounds in the first half, which ended with the 
Knicks leading 50-28 after outscoring the Bulls 31-13 in the second quarter.

 "I'm sure the NBA wasn't happy the game was on national TV," Jackson said. "It 
wasn't pretty to coach and it wasn't pretty to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen scored 25 points for the Bulls but missed 14 of 23 shots. He is 
21 of 66 since being voted All-Star game MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 122, Washington 101 -- Lakers take note: The Nets are winning 
without Derrick Coleman, the subject of Laker trade rumors who has been 
sidelined for four games with a sprained left ankle. The Nets' victory over the 
Bullets at East Rutherford, N.J., was their fifth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Armon Gilliam has been filling the void nicely. The former Nevada Las Vegas 
star had 24 points and 10 rebounds in the victory over the Bullets and has 
averaged 17.8 points and 11.7 rebounds in the four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit Benjamin made all nine of his shots from the field and finished with 18 
points and 10 rebounds. Kenny Anderson, who had a career-high 42 points in a 
victory over Bullets on Friday night, got into foul trouble early and was on 
the bench four minutes into the game. He managed 14 points and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington rookie Calbert Cheaney, who had career highs of 30 and 31 points in 
his last two outings, left the game late in the second quarter because of a 
tendon injury that could sideline him for the rest of the season. X-rays will 
be taken today. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 101, Seattle 95 -- Derrick McKey scored 27 points against his former 
teammates, leading the Pacers over the SuperSonics at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter McKey suffered a cut hand that required six stitches, but 
he returned with 7:49 to play and the Pacers trailing, 83-79. The victory was 
the ninth in 10 games for the Pacers and moved them above the .500 mark at 
25-24, the first time they've had a winning record since they were 40-39 late 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 102, Boston 93 -- The Trail Blazers used a 20-5 run in the second 
quarter to take command at Portland. It was the Celtics' eighth consecutive 
loss to tie the second-longest losing streak in team history. Clifford Robinson 
scored 24 points for Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 105, Charlotte 101 -- Mark Price made two free throws with 1:02 left 
in overtime, then added a jumper in the closing seconds, leading the Cavaliers 
over the Hornets at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Phills, averaging 5.9 points, led the Cavaliers with a career-high 23 
points. Price finished with 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 109, Milwaukee 104 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 38 points and rolled in 
a soft shot with 1:07 left that helped the Magic win at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 97, Atlanta 92 -- Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 19 points and Reggie 
Williams had 18 as the Nuggets rallied in the fourth quarter to win at Denver.

A CONFIDENT GRAF WILL BE TOUGH TO BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steffi Graf has dominated the Women's Tennis Assn. tour in the 10-month 
absence of Monica Seles, who has not played since she was stabbed by a 
spectator last April 30 during a tournament at Hamburg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf has won 10 of her last 11 tournaments, including all four Grand Slam 
events, and is 60-2 since May 2, when she lost to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 
the final at Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the focus will be on Graf in the Evert Cup, which runs today through 
Sunday at Hyatt Grand Champions. The seven other seeded players in the 
32-player field -- Mary Joe Fernandez, Lindsay Davenport, Natalia Zvereva, 
Helena Sukova, Amanda Coetzer, Sabine Hack and Judith Wiesner -- are a combined 
2-73 against the world's top-ranked player. Zina Garrison-Jackson has withdrawn 
because of a sore Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Fernandez, who won the Evert Cup last year but is winless in 11 
matches against Graf, said: "She is pretty invincible right now. She's very 
confident, and when Steffi gets confident, it's tough to beat her. She's really 
on a high." 
</P>
<P>
 What will it take to beat her? 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to play very aggressively," Fernandez said. "You can't let her 
dictate play. She's very fast and, obviously, when she's on the offensive, 
you're in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to (play her aggressively) because she has a big serve, but the 
players that have done well against her are the ones who have attacked her and 
have been able to put her under pressure." JERRY CROWE

NHL ROUNDUP; CAPITALS COME BACK TO TIE SABRES, 3-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three of the six games played in the NHL on Sunday ended in ties, with a 
fourth coming within 33 seconds of one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Capitals, trailing 2-1 after two periods, salvaged a 3-3 tie 
with the Buffalo Sabres at Landover, Md., as Mike Ridley scored with 5:44 left 
in regulation, enabling the Capitals to extend their unbeaten streak to a 
season-high seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 1, Chicago 1 -- Rookie goaltender Martin Brodeur made 42 saves as 
the Devils rallied for a 1-1 tie at Chicago. Blackhawk goalie Ed Belfour 
stopped 33 shots and had a shutout until Corey Millen scored from 25 feet out 
at 4:58 of the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 2, Tampa Bay 2 -- Rookie Chris Gratton's goal at 6:52 of the third 
period gave the Lightning a tie with the Bruins at St. Petersburg, Fla. 
Gratton's goal came 59 seconds after Adam Oates gave the Bruins a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 4, Florida 3 -- Sergei Fedorov scored on a wraparound with 33 seconds 
left in overtime as the Red Wings beat the Panthers at Miami. Florida scored 
twice in the third period to erase a 3-1 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 5, Winnipeg 2 -- Theoren Fleury and Robert Reichel had two goals each 
as the Flames won at Calgary. The Jets are winless in their last 15 games and 
only 2-17-2 since Jan. 1.

DESPITE SPASMS, HILL WINS WITH 63 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Hill started his day wondering if muscle spasms would prevent him from 
retaining his title in the final round of the Senior PGA Tour's IntelliNet 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving treatments for more than an hour, Hill went out and shot a 
course-record 63 to win by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 9 o'clock in the morning I was standing, talking to my wife, and had a 
muscle spasm," Hill said. "I did not know if I was going to play or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill drove himself from the hotel to the golf course, but had to be helped by 
his son, Mike Jr., from the car to the fitness trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought about shooting 63," Hill said. "I was just hoping to shoot 
par." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he was on the course, the putts started falling and Hill's victory turned 
into a runaway. Runner-up Tom Wargo finished three shots behind despite a 
closing 68. Associated Press

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: PRESIDENTS' DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Flagg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LOOK WHO'S TALKING: Today is Presidents' Day, and if you find yourself waxing 
nostalgic for Ronald Reagan -- or you've just got to know more about Millard 
Fillmore -- here's just the thing: For $49.95, you can get a CD-ROM "talking 
book" for your computer that will play audio excerpts of Reagan's speeches and 
tell you all about our 13th President. SoftBooks Inc. of Lake Forest has sold 
about 100,000 copies of "The Presidents," which is not bad, says company 
President David Mann, even if "a lot of them were bought by makers of CD-ROM 
drives who gave them away to customers." 
</P>
<P>
 GROVER'S LEGACY: Orange County's biggest memorial to a President isn't native 
son Richard Nixon's presidential library in Yorba Linda. For sheer size, it's 
the 105 square miles of Cleveland National Forest, which runs along the 
mountainous eastern edge of the county. Named for Grover Cleveland, it was 
created in 1908. Strangely enough, Orange County didn't even vote for the 
Democrat during his successful run for the presidency in 1892: That year, local 
voters liked Republican Benjamin Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 GOODBY, ABE?: After the Nixon Library and the Cleveland National Forest, the 
most visible symbol of the presidency in Orange County is the talking Lincoln 
robot at Disneyland. But for a public uproar three years ago, Disneyland might 
have replaced old Honest Abe with the Muppets. Now there's a rumor -- denied by 
the park -- that it's again considering retirement for the 16th President. "Not 
that I've heard," says a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 FIRST IN A SERIES: The first presidential candidate to visit what is now 
Orange County wasn't here to campaign. The year was 1846, and Col. John C. 
Fremont scouted the place twice during the Mexican War. "The Great Pathfinder" 
went on to become the first Republican nominee for the presidency in 1856 -- 
only to lose to Democrat James Buchanan. Fremont was the first in a long line 
of presidential nominees to troop through the county. Says county historian Jim 
Sleeper: "There've been at least two dozen of 'em."

VALLEY NEWSWATCH / SPECIAL REPORT: AFTER SHOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BUY! SELL!: Rosy-faced San Fernando Valley realtors are saying "I told you so" 
as home sales approach normal levels a month after the Northridge temblor. . . 
. In the south Valley, real estate brokers have been rocking and rolling. 
Through this weekend, the Encino staff for Jon Douglas Co. has sold 40 homes, 
just under the norm."Our numbers are a bit down," said assistant manager Karen 
Robb, "but not as much as you'd expect." 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE SHAKEN: Still losing sleep over last month's earthquake? Don't wait to 
get help. Mental health experts say long-term depression can set in a month to 
six weeks after a catastrophic event. The North Valley Family Counseling Center 
offers free one-on-one quake counseling as long as it's needed, as well as 
group sessions in English and Spanish. Call (818) 365-8588. 
</P>
<P>
 PAPER CHASE: After cleaning up scattered records (above), medical experts are 
eyeing ways to ensure that patient information stays intact during the next 
temblor: computerization. . . . Record keepers such as those at the Facey Group 
want to make paper obsolete. In the group's six local offices, more than 
200,000 paper records were scattered. "The bottom line," said administrator 
Donald Abramsky, "is to ensure no record goes into the wrong file." 
</P>
<P>
 RETAIL RIVER: In Sherman Oaks, badly rocked by the quake, planners and Ventura 
Boulevard businesses are giving the word to the rest of the San Fernando 
Valley: "Shoppers, come back!". . . Despite building demolition along the 
boulevard, many businesses have already reopened, such as the Sherman Oaks 
Galleria and Pacific 4 Theaters. The Radisson Hotel, Ralph's supermarket and 
Sav-On drugstore are all expected to reopen by June 1. "We're shook but not 
shaken," said Jeff Brain, chairman of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan 
Review Board.

 EXECUTIVE TRAVEL: In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan made presidential visits to 
Ventura County a common occurrence. But several others had come before him. . . 
. Benjamin Harrison made the earliest known visit in 1891. Franklin Roosevelt 
slipped through the county under wartime secrecy conditions. Thousands cheered 
John Kennedy during a 20-minute visit to Point Mugu. . . . Theodore Roosevelt 
told an enthusiastic Ventura crowd in 1903: "I have passed through a veritable 
paradise and I do not wonder that you all look so happy." 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE READY: Simi Valley will upgrade its computers in preparation for future 
earthquakes (B5). The city joins other agencies that have been reviewing 
response to last month's disaster. . . . "It's a scary scenario going through a 
disaster and even scarier if people are not familiar with their roles," said 
Wendy Haddock of the county's Office of Emergency Services. "Redundancy is the 
name of the game." . . . In the fall, the county tested its emergency skills by 
simulating a magnitude 8.0 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 BRAIN GAMES: What do geniuses do when they get together? Play carnival games. 
That's what 200 members of Mensa, the high-IQ society, are doing this long 
holiday weekend. . . . The group, which limits its membership to people with 
IQs higher than 98% of the population, held its regional gathering in Ventura. 
"It's much more like a high school reunion than an intellectual gathering," 
publicity chairwoman Linda Seebach said. . . . The only subject off limits: How 
high is your IQ? 
</P>
<P>
 FREE AT LAST: The Conejo Valley unit of B'nai B'rith Haverim today celebrates 
the Jewish festival of Purim. . . . The holiday is based on a 2,500-year-old 
legend that pits Queen Esther, wife of Persia's King Ahasveros, against Haman, 
a royal adviser intent on destroying the Jews. Score: Esther 1, Haman 0. . . . 
"Certainly you have new Hamans coming up all the time," said Rita Wagner, 
co-president of the local unit. "It's important to remember the past so 
something like that doesn't happen again." President's Day

 WATCHING RENO: The White House is quietly moving to assume more control over 
outspoken Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. One of the means, Administration insiders say, 
will be Ron Klain, a White House lawyer who has been appointed Reno's 
counselor. His role is an example of how the Clinton White House has exerted 
control over the executive branch by appointing the powerful chiefs of staff in 
each agency to look over Cabinet members' shoulders. . . . While the Justice 
Department has no chief of staff position, most think Klain will function as 
one. His move also signals that Reno is so independent that having one of 
President Clinton's closest friends, Webster L. Hubbell, as No. 3 at the 
Justice Department is not enough. Along with more White House coordination and 
control, it is hoped that Klain, a former aide to Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
(D-Del.), will make the department better organized and more sensitive to 
Congress.

 GET LOST: The mastermind behind Iraq's secret arms program, Hussein Kamel 
Majid, has undergone brain surgery in Jordan, according to Western diplomatic 
sources. But -- to Washington's relief -- attempts by the Iraqi government to 
obtain further medical treatment for him in the West, particularly Europe, have 
been rebuffed. Majid has a brain tumor, which sources say is not believed to be 
malignant. . . . After President Saddam Hussein, Majid may be the Iraqi whom 
Washington monitors most closely. Married to one of Hussein's daughters, Majid 
is one of the regime's most powerful and ruthless officials. Before the Persian 
Gulf War, he oversaw acquisition of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction 
through covert front companies, some in the United States.

<P>
 SPINNING HEALTH CARE: Politics is becoming more and more a game of getting 
your fax out. In the health care debate, four of the big players are jockeying 
for influence by putting out their own electronic newsletters. The 
publications, from the White House and three congressional sources, toss 
rapidly spinning curveballs, seeking to strike out rival plans while hitting 
their own out of the park. . . . The oh-so-cleverly named White House Health 
Care Delivery Room, a public relations operation formerly called the War Room, 
has the most sophisticated distribution system, sending "talking points" on the 
President's reform plan to 1,200 people by fax and to 5,000 others via the 
Internet computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MORE SPIN: Perhaps because his Canadian-style, single-payer health plan is 
such an underdog, Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) puts out the breeziest 
publication, irreverently jabbing opponents. "Apparently folks in Tennessee 
haven't gotten the word from the inside-the-Beltway media experts about what a 
great health reform plan Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) has put forward," McDermott 
wrote, spotlighting the opposition of a group of Tennessee unions and churches 
to Cooper's plan. . . . Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.), a Senate co-sponsor of 
the Cooper bill, is regularly mailing four-pagers to constituents, colleagues 
and interest groups, while Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.), who rode to an upset 
victory in 1991 on the health care issue, uses his Health Reform Bulletin to 
highlight his support of Clinton's plan -- and to suggest improvements.

 IT'S A STICKUP: Speaking of the faxes, the cover sheet is often what makes the 
difference between being noticed -- and not. And after fires and riots and 
quakes and droughts, Los Angeles still has a lot to boast about. So what does 
the L.A. office of the FBI put on a recent cover sheet above the imposing FBI

CLINTON ENCOURAGED BY REMOVAL OF BOSNIA WEAPONS; BALKANS: SERBS MAY NEED MORE 
TIME TO COMPLY, HE SUGGESTS. PRESIDENT IS 'HOPEFUL' AIR STRIKES CAN BE AVERTED. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton said Sunday that he is encouraged by signs that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's Serbs are removing their heavy weapons from around 
Sarajevo and suggested that they might need more time to comply with a NATO 
ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after warning that U.S. warplanes stood ready to bomb any artillery not 
surrendered to U.N. control or pulled out from within a 12-mile radius of 
Sarajevo by 1 a.m. today Sarajevo time (4 p.m. Sunday Pacific time), Clinton 
told reporters that he had received "encouraging" news from NATO and U.N. 
commanders about the Serbs' efforts to meet the deadline. He said he is 
"hopeful" that the need for air strikes can be averted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs seem to be moving weapons, and also bringing U.N. forces to the 
weapons that cannot be moved. So that much is encouraging," Clinton said after 
attending a church service in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the deadline for compliance with the NATO ultimatum passed, 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said, "All known heavy weapons have 
either been withdrawn from the exclusion zone, are under the control of the 
United Nations . . . or soon should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.N. and NATO commanders have concluded that no air strikes are necessary 
at this time," Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Clinton, who was in the White House as the deadline expired, had 
discussed the situation by telephone with NATO Secretary General Manfred 
Woerner. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials said shortly before the deadline expired that 
no decision on whether to bomb remaining Serbian positions had been made -- or 
would be made until the situation on the ground could be fully assessed. The 
assessment, they added, is unlikely to be completed until today at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 But they added that the Serbs have been engaging in what one official 
described as a "hectic" effort to comply with the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 "All day the Bosnian Serbs have been drawing heavy weapons out of the 
exclusion zone. We are confirming artillery sites that have been abandoned and 
are doing so all day," the official said, adding that there was also a 
"dramatic increase" during the course of the day in the number of heavy weapons 
that the Serbs were surrendering to U.N. control in 10 designated collection 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a "relatively small number" of artillery sites had not been secured by 
U.N. forces because of "abysmal" weather conditions and snowbound roads, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been tremendous progress," the official added, expressing optimism 
that the remaining artillery sites will all be under U.N. control by today. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their increasingly upbeat tone, Clinton and senior officials continued 
to insist that the deadline remains firm, with U.S. and other NATO warplanes 
prepared to launch air strikes against any heavy weapons that remained in the 
exclusion zone after Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfectly clear that the deadline is the deadline and that full 
compliance means just that. . . . NATO right now does not intend to give 
another warning," Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, said in an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 But with U.N. commanders in Sarajevo warning that the Serbs would not be able 
to remove all their weapons in time because of heavy snowfall, Shalikashvili 
and other officials also suggested that the deadline's expiration meant only 
that the gun emplacements could be attacked at NATO's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton carefully made that point in his remarks outside the Episcopal church 
where he and his family attended services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deadline only makes the artillery positions subject to attack," he noted, 
adding that what happens afterward will depend on a U.N. and NATO assessment of 
"the facts on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton said the Serbs had "plainly" not moved or surrendered all of 
their weapons around Sarajevo, he indicated that the heavy snows should be 
taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should keep the deadline . . . (but) there may or may not be some 
questions about whether all those weapons can be put into U.N. control, 
depending as much as anything else on the weather there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright said that what the 
NATO allies "are looking for is an end to the shelling of Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 "The deadline extends into the future," she told Cable News Network.

WILFRIED F. H .M. MOMMAERTS; HEART RESEARCH PIONEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wilfried F. H .M. Mommaerts, whose research into cardiovascular disease and 
function led to new insights into the mechanisms of the heart as a muscle and 
not merely a pump, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman at UCLA, where he was a former chairman and professor emeritus of 
the department of physiology, said Friday that Mommaerts was 76 when he died 
Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Mommaerts joined the UCLA faculty in 1956 as professor of medicine and 
physiology and director of the Los Angeles County Heart Research Laboratory at 
UCLA. He became chairman in 1966 and retired in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, Los Angeles first became recognized as a world center for heart 
surgery and science. 
</P>
<P>
 Mommaerts, born in the Netherlands, had done research in Europe where he 
studied under Nobel laureate A. Szent-Gyorgyi. In Los Angeles, Mommaerts 
changed the emphasis of physiological research of the heart, leading scientists 
to acknowledge that understanding of the heart will not be complete until it is 
fully understood as a muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 His honors included election to the National Academy of Arts and Sciences, the 
Los Angeles County Heart Assn.'s Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award and 
the Alexander Von Humboldt award in 1985.

CSUF HONOR STUDENT DIED OF STAB WOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cathy Torrez, the Cal State Fullerton honor student whose body was found in 
the trunk of her car, died of multiple stab wounds, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia police spokeswoman Corrine Loomis said further tests are needed 
before a time of death can be determined, and she declined to say whether a 
motive or a suspect has been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to say anything that will jeopardize our investigation," Loomis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, the family of the 20-year-old woman, who had been missing since 
Feb. 12, issued a statement: "Whatever happened never should have happened. 
Nobody had a right to take (Cathy) away so young. . . . It would be pretty 
impossible to find a person who didn't like her. To begin to think about 
whoever did this to her is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 The prepared statement was read by a family spokesman, Albert Gonzales, who 
joined Loomis at a press conference at Placentia Nazarene Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Torrez, a junior sociology major at Cal State Fullerton, was 
discovered Saturday, a week after the woman vanished after leaving work. Her 
car was found in the Placentia Linda Community Hospital parking lot by patrol 
officers, but investigators did not know how long it had been there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are actively soliciting information from any citizen who may have seen 
Torrez or her vehicle . . . between Feb. 12" and Saturday, Loomis said. The car 
is a 1990 burgundy Toyota Corolla, license plate number 2RMC 785. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need any piece of information, no matter how insignificant it may seem," 
Loomis said. "Oftentimes somebody will hear something through the grapevine, 
because somebody will say something. They need to give us that information." 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner officials declined to comment on the case Sunday, directing all 
inquiries to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said it had not been determined where Torrez met her attacker. She 
was last seen at 8 p.m. Feb. 12 driving alone out of the parking lot of the 
Sav-On drugstore at the corner of Bradford Avenue and Yorba Linda Boulevard. 
She had been a checker at the store for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by family and friends as a responsible and conscientious woman who 
did not like to be out alone, Torrez had called her mother -- with whom she 
lived, along with her stepfather, her brother and one of her two sisters -- 
only minutes before she left work and indicated that she would be home shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Her normal route would have taken her one mile south on Bradford, a 
residential street lined with homes and apartments. She would have stopped at 
one stop sign and one stoplight. The hospital parking lot where her body was 
found is a mile away in an opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales disputed a newspaper report that Torrez may have been romantically 
involved with a young man who had tried to kill himself the week before she 
disappeared. He said they were only friends. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund has been established to help the family pay for the funeral, which is 
pending. Donations can be sent to the Cathy Torrez Memorial Fund, c/o Placentia 
Nazarene Church, 126 N. Walnut Ave., Placentia, Calif. 92670.

STREET SMART: NO GETTING OFF ON A TECHNICALITY: UNSIGNED TRAFFIC TICKET IS 
VALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I recently received a speeding ticket from a California Highway Patrol officer 
for going 73 m.p.h. in a 55-m.p.h. zone. However, the officer was young and 
seemed inexperienced and neglected to have me sign the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this invalidate the ticket? While my guess is that a warrant could not be 
issued for failure to appear, nevertheless, my question relates to the traffic 
violation itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Gold Newport Beach Is this wishful thinking? Signature or no signature, 
the ticket is your responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Signing a traffic ticket is not an admission of guilt, but it is a promise you 
will appear in court on the date specified on the ticket, said Steve Kohler, a 
CHP spokesman. Usually with speeding tickets and similar traffic offenses, you 
will receive a courtesy notice in the mail three to four weeks after you are 
ticketed. 
</P>
<P>
 The courtesy notice will state your options, Kohler said. You may be able to 
avoid a court date by paying your fine through the mail or by paying your fine 
and attending traffic school, which also would expunge the violation from your 
driving record, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But heed this warning from one who knows: If you don't receive a courtesy 
notice in the mail, you are still responsible for showing up in traffic court 
on your appointed date or handling the matter in one of the other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 An unsigned citation also gives the patrol officer the added option of filing 
a formal complaint through the district attorney's office, said Cherie 
Garofalo, office supervisor for the traffic division of Orange County Municipal 
Court. The district attorney's office would then mail you an "appearance 
letter," which is like a very formal courtesy notice, she said. You then are 
responsible for following the instructions spelled out in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When the committee against car-pool lanes was in existence, it found that some 
lanes were smaller than regulation width when construction was taking place. 
The lanes were made wider. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some shoulders have been eliminated and some lanes have a very narrow 
width. Only one example is the right slow lane of the Santa Ana Freeway going 
north from Red Hill Avenue to the Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Who makes the rules for freeway shoulder width and freeway lane width and who 
enforces these rules? 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Wiley Fullerton Lane width standards for federally funded highways are 
set by the Federal Highway Administration. The California Department of 
Transportation uses the standards for most state highways and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard lane width is 12 feet, and the standard shoulder width is five to 
10 feet on the left and 10 feet on the right, said Caltrans spokeswoman Rose 
Orem. Standards are not always met in specific areas because of limited space, 
existing structures and available rights of way, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it is necessary to reduce the lane widths along construction 
projects to provide room for workers, equipment and safety barriers, Orem said. 
Construction areas are exempt from the standards, and lanes may be temporarily 
striped to a minimum of 10 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Caltrans prefers to provide at least 11-foot lanes with 
two-foot shoulders, said Caltrans Chief Deputy Director Walt Hagen. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority, in cooperation with local senior 
centers, has scheduled a number of public forums to discuss potential changes 
to OCTA's Dial-a-Ride and Access services for senior citizens and people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing service for people who are unable to use regular, fixed-route 
transit services is required by the federal Americans With Disabilities Act. 
Demand for such service in Orange County has increased sharply, causing the 
OCTA board of directors to approve an additional $300,000 in funding for 
supplemental taxicab service. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the special services is expected to continue growing and has 
led to a number of proposed changes, including a fare increase from $1.50 to $2 
and the elimination of Dial-a-Ride for able-bodied senior citizens and youth 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The public forums are scheduled to last an hour. The first forums are planned 
for 1:30 p.m. Thursday at the Fullerton Senior Center, 340 W. Commonwealth 
Ave., and for 1:30 p.m. Feb. 28 at the H. Lewis Lake Senior Center, 11300 
Stanford Ave., Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 During March, forums are scheduled in Mission Viejo, Buena Park, Santa Ana, 
Huntington Beach, Anaheim, Irvine, Orange and San Clemente. For reservations or 
more information on the forums, call OCTA customer relations at (714) 636-RIDE. 
</P>

COUPLE KILLED IN COLLISION DURING RAIN; WEATHER: THEIR 2 CHILDREN, ANOTHER GIRL 
ARE CRITICALLY HURT. STORM CAUSES FLOODING IN DANA POINT, CLOSURE OF LAGUNA 
CANYON ROAD, PCH IN HUNTINGTON BEACH. MUDSLIDES HIT MALIBU.

<P>
 An intense winter downpour, the third major storm to hit the region in two 
weeks, on Sunday triggered a traffic accident in Anaheim that killed a San Luis 
Obispo County couple and critically injured three others -- including the 
couple's two teen-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain also caused minor flooding in some areas of Dana Point, forced the 
brief closure of a section of Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach and, to 
the north, left Malibu residents once again digging out of mud and debris that 
surged down rain-soaked hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the storm's wrath turned deadly about 7:10 a.m. as Joseph 
Franklin Reagan, 50, and his wife, Linda Lee, 42, of Los Osos traveled east in 
their van near Gypsum Canyon Road on the Riverside Freeway in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 A California Highway Patrol spokeswoman said the van was traveling about 65 
m.p.h. in heavy rain when Joseph Reagan lost control of the vehicle, which slid 
across three lanes before broadsiding a semitrailer truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who were wearing seat belts, were pronounced dead at the scene. 
Their son, Joseph Charles, 18, and daughter, Wendi Lee, 15, suffered multiple 
injuries and were rushed to UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 A third passenger in the Reagan van, identified as Sarah Burns, 15, was taken 
to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. All three were listed in critical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP spokeswoman said the truck's driver, Richard August Thayer, 34, was 
not injured. Thayer had just delivered a load of milk in Santa Ana and was 
heading back to his home in Ontario when the collision occurred, according to 
the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the tragedy in Anaheim, Sunday's heavy rains prompted renewed fears 
of mudslides in Laguna Beach after mud cascaded over the hillsides onto Laguna 
Canyon Road. Officials were forced to close off the roadway for about an hour 
from the San Diego Freeway to Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had mud and water coming across the road to such a degree that it was 
making it unsafe for vehicles to pass," said Officer Joh Fehlman. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said no homes in the area were in danger, but as a precaution, Red 
Cross officials opened a temporary evacuation center at Laguna Beach High 
School, which remained virtually empty throughout the day. Accustomed to 
mudslide scares, most Laguna Beach residents chose to remain in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The minor flooding in Dana Point consisted of overflowing of some flood 
control channels, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy rains kept police and fire officials busy with minor traffic 
accidents and calls for service throughout the day. In Fullerton, firefighters 
were called out to rescue a German shepherd dog that was swept down a flood 
control channel by angry floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of fire and police units, an animal control officer managed to 
snare the frightened dog near Dale Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog's "nails were all bleeding because she was dragged along the cement 
walls" by the rushing water, said Ray Easley, a Fullerton Fire Department 
battalion chief. "She was so glad to be out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData, said Santa Ana received the 
most rainfall in Orange County, 1.53 inches. Newport Beach received .86 of an 
inch, Anaheim recorded .84 and .7 fell in El Toro. Figures for South County 
weren't available. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said there was a 30% chance of isolated showers this morning, but no 
other rainfall is predicted for the first half of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the powerful cloudbursts Sunday forced a brief closing of 
Interstate 5 at the Grapevine.  
</P>
<P>
 The showers dropped up to three inches of rain along some parts of the coast 
and up to a foot of snow in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The two deaths in Orange County weren't the only traffic fatalities: An 
unidentified man was killed Sunday morning when his car skidded out of control 
on the westbound Artesia Freeway near the Lakewood Boulevard intersection in 
Bellflower. The man, who was not wearing a seat belt, died when he was thrown 
from his car. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain was also blamed for two power outages Sunday that left more than 
1,600 Southern California Edison customers in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica 
without electricity for two hours, an Edison spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, rescue workers raced Sunday to evacuate residents whose homes were 
threatened by the movement of water, mud and rocks toward the sea. Garages and 
front doors of more than 50 homes along Pacific Coast Highway were inundated. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County lifeguards and sheriff's deputies used ropes to rescue 
Christa Roberts and her two sons, ages 9 and 10, from their home on Carbon 
Canyon Road, where a river of water about 4 feet deep and 15 feet wide swept 
down the canyon, blocking their escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasier Filippin, a Big Rock resident who was on his way to the ski slopes, 
refused to leave his Mercedes-Benz when it became mired in the mud near the 
intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Big Rock Drive. Filippin sat in the 
vehicle for nearly an hour and a half as the fast-moving water crept halfway up 
the silver car. 
</P>
<P>
 Filippin was finally plucked to safety by a lifeguard who was lowered to the 
vehicle by the scoop of a CalTrans caterpillar.  
</P>
<P>
 Standing under an umbrella on a stack of sandbags across from his car, 
Filippin said: "I'm very upset. Honest to God, I don't want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Caltrans skip loaders worked at scooping up the muck, filling dump 
trucks that unloaded the ooze over the side of the highway and down to the 
ocean at Las Flores Canyon Road and Big Rock Drive. Officials closed the 
highway between Topanga Canyon Road and Cross Creek Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At Las Flores Canyon Road and Pacific Coast Highway, an enormous mudflow 
filled the parking lot and part of the interior of the Charley Brown's Sea Lion 
Restaurant, and flowed into the ground floor of a nearby five-unit, two-story 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had it made because we didn't get it in the other disasters, 
but it just came through our bedroom, broke the wall open," said a woman who 
lived in a ground-floor apartment with her husband and asked not to be named. 
"We couldn't get the door open, but we finally got out. Everything is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of residents whose homes were hit in the Feb. 7 storm, which damaged 
at least 25 homes, found their homes inundated again by Sunday's rain.

GIVING GRAFFITI THE BRUSHOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When there's any hint of danger, such as the time he painted over graffiti on 
a freeway median in San Juan Capistrano, Phil Duke works alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But whenever he gets a chance, the 46-year-old house painter takes the family 
along to help out on his two-year quest as Capistrano Beach's self-appointed 
top tag-buster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take the kids with me to show them how crummy graffiti looks," said Duke. 
"I've always been a hands-on kind of person and I try to do as much as I can 
with them. This is a way to show my kids how to have pride in their community." 
</P>
<P>
 What has developed is a one-family crusade to rid their neighborhood of 
unsightly graffiti. Several times a month, Duke cruises the San 
Clemente/Capistrano Beach area, bringing 13-year-old Rusty Duke or 11-year-old 
Mardi Duke to assist with painting chores whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 A professional painter, Duke has all the tools he needs in his van, including 
supplies of gray paint to match cement surfaces. Custom colors in his arsenal 
of paint are donated by a local paint shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's a city light pole, neighborhood fence or back wall of a local 
business, Duke moves in and does the job, then leaves without accepting payment 
or even a pat on the back. Most times, the property owner isn't even aware that 
Duke was there until the graffiti disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 One night last December, vandals defaced the white exterior walls of an office 
building in San Clemente's Ocean View Plaza, a retail/office complex facing 
busy Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, property manager Robert Haig sent his handyman to buy paint 
to clean up the mess. Shortly after the handyman left, Haig saw a white van 
pull up to the rear of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man and his daughter started unloading equipment; it looked suspicious," 
Haig said. "I asked him if anyone was paying him and he said no, and then I 
really got suspicious. Then I asked him what compensation he was getting for 
this and he said, 'I just want to keep my neighborhood clean; this is what I 
do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that I was going upstairs to write him a check and he said, 'No, 
thank you,' " Haig recalled. "He was just doing it as a good Samaritan." 
</P>
<P>
 Haig called San Clemente Mayor Scott Diehl, who officially commended Duke at a 
City Council meeting this month. Naturally, the Dukes came as a family to 
accept the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't make the mistake of viewing the family as the Ozzie and Harriet of 
Orange County, warns Duke's wife, Nedia. Two of their four children have 
learning disorders that cause them to struggle in school, she said. And family 
squabbles, particularly among the younger children, aren't uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our rough edges," said Nedia, 37. "The kids are real active and half 
the time it drives us nuts. But Phil tries very hard to do things with the 
kids. He takes them to a bunch of activities like Indian Guide and Indian 
Princess (youth programs) and I think he enjoys it more than the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to show our kids the value of working as a team," she said. "That's 
why he takes them along when he goes to take care of the graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Duke's urge to eliminate graffiti evolved slowly over recent years when 
he commuted to house-painting jobs in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw how really bad graffiti is in Los Angeles when I'd work there," Duke 
said. "Then I saw it creep down to Anaheim, then Mission Viejo. When I saw it 
show up in Capistrano Beach, I said I'm not going to let this happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 One evening, the family drove past a public sign defaced by graffiti. In 
disgusted tones, Duke criticized the ugliness. The next day, Nedia Duke drove 
past the signs again "and it was gone. Phil had already wiped it out," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti is one of South County's fastest growing problems. Local communities 
that contract with the county Sheriff's Department for police protection have 
formed a regional task force known as the Delta Force to combat the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, officers have arrested 15 graffiti vandals over the last year, 
including two on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen a significant increase throughout South County over the last 
year," said Mission Viejo Sgt. Fred Lusante. "It's one of the primary jobs of 
the Delta Force." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always like this. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gary Cleppe worked in Vista Paints' Mission Viejo store two years ago, 
there were no complaints about graffiti from customers. But since Cleppe took 
over the paint chain's San Juan Capistrano outlet in mid-1991, he has seen 
droves of people come in to get paint to cover up graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we average at least one customer per day coming in to buy paint 
because of a graffiti problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleppe donates the store's slightly miscolored paints to Duke "because I can't 
see him taking money out of his pocket for this kind of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the kind of guy who, if he sees something wrong in the community, he'll 
do something about it," Cleppe said. "There's a lot of graffiti out there, but 
people like him make the difference."

STORM DELIVERS A MUDDY PUNCH; WEATHER: THREE PEOPLE ARE KILLED ON SOUTHLAND 
FREEWAYS IN THE THIRD MAJOR DOWNPOUR IN TWO WEEKS. MOUNTAINS GET HEAVY SNOW, 
AND NEW SLIDES HIT THE BURNED AREAS OF MALIBU.

<P>
 An intense winter downpour -- the third major storm to hit the region in two 
weeks -- brought heavy snowfalls to local mountains and left Malibu residents 
once again digging out of mud and debris that surged down rain-soaked 
hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful cloudbursts Sunday trapped some beachfront residents in their 
homes and cars, forced a brief closing of Interstate 5 at the Grapevine and set 
loose mudslides that shut down a portion of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The showers, which dropped up to 3 inches of rain along the coast and as much 
as a foot of snow in the mountains, are expected to taper off today, 
forecasters say, leaving the cityto calculate the damage under clear skies. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain-slick freeways and roads caused major traffic tie-ups and contributed 
to numerous accidents, including three fatalities in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified man was killed Sunday morning when his car skidded out of 
control on the westbound Artesia Freeway near Lakewood Boulevard. The man, who 
was not wearing a seat belt, died when he was thrown from his car. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, two people died Sunday when they lost control of their van 
on the Riverside Freeway near Yorba Linda. The van was hit by a big-rig truck, 
a California Highway Patrol officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain was also blamed for two power outages Sunday that left more than 
1,600 Southern California Edison customers in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica 
without electricity for two hours, an Edison spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Red Cross closed its last post-earthquake shelter, in Fillmore. 
At the peak, the organization operated 47 shelters for quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, rescue workers raced Sunday to evacuate residents whose homes were 
threatened by the movement of water, mud and rocks toward the sea. Garages and 
front doors of more than 50 homes along PCH were inundated. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County lifeguards and sheriff's deputies used ropes to rescue 
Christa Roberts and her two sons, ages 9 and 10, from their home on Carbon 
Canyon Road, where a river about 4 feet deep and 15 feet wide swept down the 
canyon, blocking their escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasier Filippin, a Big Rock resident who was on his way to the ski slopes, 
refused to leave his Mercedes-Benz when it became mired in the mud near the 
intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Big Rock Drive. Filippin sat in the 
silver car for nearly 1 1/2 hours as the fast-moving water crept halfway up its 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Filippin was finally plucked to safety by a lifeguard who was lowered to the 
vehicle by the scoop of a Caltrans earthmover.  
</P>
<P>
 Standing under an umbrella on a stack of sandbags across from his car, 
Filippin said, "I'm very upset. Honest to God, I don't want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Caltrans skip-loaders worked at scooping up the muck, filling dump 
trucks that unloaded the ooze over the side of the highway and down to the 
ocean at Las Flores Canyon Road and Big Rock Drive. Officials closed the 
highway between Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Cross Creek Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At Las Flores Canyon Road and Pacific Coast Highway, an enormous mudflow 
filled the parking lot and part of the interior of Charley Brown's Sea Lion 
Restaurant, and flowed into the ground floor of a nearby five-unit, two-story 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had it made because we didn't get it in the other disasters, 
but it just came through our bedroom, broke the wall open. . . ," said a woman 
who lived in a ground-floor apartment with her husband and asked not to be 
identified. "We couldn't get the door open, but we finally got out. Everything 
is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of residents whose homes were among at least 25 damaged in the Feb. 7 
storm found them inundated again by Sunday's rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "A neighbor called at about 2 a.m. and told me to get ready to be evacuated," 
said Sid Jacobson, who had just finished putting his garage door back up from 
damage from the last storm. "Then I heard a river that sounded like Niagara 
Falls come through. Then I went back to sleep. What the hell else am I going to 
do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Jacobson's sandbag preparations, a 20-by-30-foot section of asphalt 
pavement between the highway and his front door collapsed and dropped about 15 
feet to the sand below. Jacobson surmised that it gave way from the weight of 
mud, rocks and water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New areas of Malibu showed vulnerability to Sunday's rain, alarming a number 
of residents along PCH just above Tuna Canyon Road, whose homes for the first 
time filled with mud. "I've been here 22 years and this mountain has never come 
down," said Peppi Kelman, pointing to the hillside across from her muddy home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the problem," she said, pointing to Pena Creek, which runs into a 
concrete drainage ditch on the mountainside above Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday morning, rain turned the creek into a rapidly moving river.

SEISMIC REPORT ON COLISEUM AT CENTER OF DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dispute over who was responsible for failing to provide a 1991 structural 
engineer's report of Coliseum earthquake danger to the Los Angeles Coliseum 
Commission has degenerated into finger-pointing, with the stadium's architects 
and its managers blaming each other. 
</P>
<P>
 A central issue -- to be investigated by city, county and state attorneys -- 
is why a warning of possible Coliseum earthquake damage was never acted upon. 
The warning by engineer Nabib Youssef came in a seismic report to the HNTB 
architectural firm, which at the time was preparing Coliseum renovation plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Youssef's report stated that the Coliseum did not meet current seismic 
construction codes and described potential damage that did, in fact, largely 
occur in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 HNTB architect Terry K. Miller said in an interview last week that in 1990 and 
1991, Spectacor, the Coliseum's management company, and the Los Angeles 
Conservancy, a preservationist group, rejected any seismic retrofit at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said that Spectacor officials informed him in 1991 that a retrofit 
would cost several million dollars, more than the firm could afford. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that as early as a 1990 workshop on Coliseum renovation, conservancy 
representatives opposed a retrofit because it would alter the appearance of the 
stadium too dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Spectacor and the conservancy disputed Miller's statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never told (HNTB) that seismic retrofitting was out," said Peter Luucko of 
Spectacor, who was responsible for managing the Coliseum at the time. "We 
simply told them to meet our design and financial criteria. I'm not going to 
tell anyone what criteria to use, because we're not qualified to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Michali, a member of the conservancy board who was present at the 1990 
workshop, called Miller's statements about the conservancy inaccurate. Opposing 
a seismic retrofit as such "is not something we would ever say," he said. "What 
we would want is a retrofit that would be sensitive" to the appearance of the 
stadium, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the workshop, Michael John Pittas, noted in a separate interview 
that the final report of the workshop characterizes a retrofit as likely. "The 
conservancy signed on to that report," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller -- the chief architect at HNTB who was concerned with designing 
Coliseum renovations -- said that the firm has documents that prove it gave 
Youssef's report to Luucko of Spectacor. But he said the firm would not release 
the documents at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not in a position to determine what was going to happen to the 
report" once it got to Spectacor, he added, saying it was the prerogative of 
the managers and not the architects to decide whether to give it to the 
Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not working for the commission at the time," Miller said. The 
commission, the Coliseum's governing board, hired Spectacor in 1988 to manage 
the facility and the adjacent Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Luucko, however, said he received 200 to 300 separate reports from HNTB, and 
he does not specifically recall receiving Youssef's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were very technical reports, and you rely on your technical people," 
Luucko said. "All I can say is, it didn't send up a red flag. . . . I might 
have gotten it and it didn't register." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Joseph of Environmental Planning Associates is also unhappy that 
Youssef's report was not provided. Environmental Planning Associates was 
charged in 1991 with preparing a draft environmental impact report for Coliseum 
renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 No final environmental impact report was produced because the ambitious 
renovation project was dropped. But there was a draft of several hundred pages 
prepared by Nov. 20, 1991, that Miller said HNTB relied upon, in part, for 
concluding that the earthquake danger at the Coliseum was not particularly 
ominous. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental report said quake damage at the Coliseum would diminish in 
direct proportion to the distance to earthquake epicenters, and it put most 
faults at a considerable distance. This was at variance with discoveries in 
some previous earthquakes -- such as the 1985 Mexico City quake and the 1989 
Loma Prieta quake -- that severe damage could occur irregularly at varying 
distances from the epicenters. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph, however, said that HNTB should have passed Youssef's report, which was 
dated Dec. 4, 1991, to him. If Joseph had received it, he said, Youssef's 
assessment would have been incorporated in later versions of the draft 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is damage control by HNTB, or spin control," Joseph said of Miller's 
statements. "We should have seen the Youssef report. . . . The bottom line is 
that HNTB blew it. . . . I can't imagine them doing it intentionally, but it 
probably just slipped through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Bonaventura, chief assistant Los Angeles city attorney, said he does not 
know how long the inquiry into the matter, ordered by the Los Angeles City 
Council, will take. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonaventura has served as an advisory attorney from the city to the 
commission. He said another longtime commission adviser, Donovan Main, the 
county's attorney advising the tripartite commission, and Richard Magasin, the 
state's legal adviser to the panel, will also participate in the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the attorneys saw the Youssef report either, until it was delivered to 
the Coliseum Commission more than two years after it was first made, 16 days 
after the Northridge earthquake, Bonaventura said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the controversy swirls, the disputing central parties remain active at the 
Coliseum and are working together on current plans to repair the Coliseum. 
Miller is the principal architect, Spectacor still manages the Coliseum, and 
the L.A. Conservancy has an important consultants' role. Youssef was hired last 
month to evaluate the quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission itself came under criticism Tuesday in City Council for 
awarding a Coliseum repair contract to the Tutor-Saliba construction company 
without bids or a precise price tag. First estimates put the cost at $35 
million, with funding expected from the federal and state disaster relief 
programs. (Southland Edition) Quakes and the Coliseum 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the key events regarding the Los Angeles Coliseum since late 
1990: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 11, 1990: Raiders owner Al Davis signs an agreement to keep his team 
in Los Angeles, contingent on a $145-million renovation of the Coliseum by the 
Spectacor Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 15: Four-day environmental workshop on Coliseum renovation concludes 
with little public discussion of seismic reinforcing. Final report calls such 
work likely. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 20, 1991: A draft environmental impact report on the proposed 
renovation notes that 123 earthquakes over magnitude 5 have occurred within 100 
miles of the Coliseum since 1800, the closest a magnitude 5.3 one mile away in 
1905. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 4: Structural engineer Nabib Youssef submits a report to Spectacor's 
architect, HNTB, saying that the Coliseum walls do not meet seismic safety 
codes and would be seriously damaged in a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on the 
nearby Newport-Inglewood Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 31: Spectacor, blaming the bad economy and disappointing sales of club 
seats, puts the renovation on hold. The firm later cancels it and gives up its 
role in renovating the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 2, 1992: Coliseum Commission, approving a scaled-down $15-million 
renovation to be done with its own funds in 1993, states that no "permanent 
seismic retrofit or seismic strengthening work" is to be done as part of the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 4, 1993: The $15-million renovation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 17, 1994: The magnitude 6.8 Northridge earthquake, centered 20 miles 
away, seriously damages the Coliseum, which is red tagged by city building 
inspectors. First damage estimates are $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 2: The Coliseum Commission meets and demands a copy of the Dec. 4, 
1991, Youssef report. Later that afternoon, it is delivered -- 16 days after 
the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 9: The Los Angeles City Council instructs City Atty. James Hahn to 
investigate who is responsible for the failure to apprise the Coliseum 
Commission of the Youssef report until after the earthquake.

FATHER AND SON, 2, SHOT IN THE HEAD; CRIME: GUNMAN IN THE CAR AHEAD OPENED FIRE 
WITHOUT WARNING AT A STOP SIGN IN POMONA, POLICE SAY. THE INJURED MAN HAD 
REPORTEDLY BEEN TRYING TO LEAVE A GANG. 
</P>

<P>
 A 35-year-old man and his 2-year-old son were both shot in the head Sunday 
morning by a man who got out of the car in front of them at a stop sign in 
Pomona, walked up and "just opened fire," police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say they believe the shooting was an act of gang retaliation; 
the father had been trying to get out of a gang and had recently moved out of 
the area to do so, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Cota was in critical condition late Sunday and his son, Mathew Frank 
Cota, was in very critical condition, said Pomona Police Lt. Larry Todd. The 
father was shot in the face, Todd said, and the boy had a bullet lodged in his 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish all of Los Angeles could be dragged though this little boy's hospital 
room to see how bad this city has become," said Detective Dexter Cole. "We 
don't know if he is going to make it or not. . . . We're all just praying for 
the little guy." 
</P>
<P>
 After being shot at least once, Cota drove to a fast-food restaurant half a 
mile away, where he pleaded with a crowd of breakfast customers and employees 
to call an ambulance for his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, I heard this rumbling, yelling noise. And this man was 
holding this child who was just covered with blood; the poor baby's head was 
just covered with blood," said Jennifer Yu, manager of the Golden Ox restaurant 
on Mission Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the baby was in shock. It wasn't making a sound; it was just staring 
into its father's eyes. And the father was just totally hysterical," Yu said. 
"All he was concerned about was his baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The father and son were taken to an undisclosed hospital trauma center, Todd 
said. Police withheld the name of the hospital to protect the victims from the 
possibility of further attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrators particularly feared for the toddler's life because of 
the bullet lodged in his brain, police said. Doctors did not operate Sunday for 
fear that extricating the bullet could cause more damage to the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said they suspected soon after the shooting that it was not 
prompted by a traffic dispute because no words were exchanged beforehand and 
the cars did not hit each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Cota was apparently trying to leave his gang, Todd said, and as a result "was 
on the outs with his friends, to the point where they wanted to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred at about 10 a.m. as Cota pulled up behind a station 
wagon at a stop sign on San Antonio Avenue near 9th Street, Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect exited from the passenger side, walked back to the victim's 
vehicle and just opened fire," putting six shots through the windshield, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it was one of those spray-and-pray" shootings, Todd said. "They may not 
have seen the baby in there. Even (gang members) don't usually shoot young 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman and driver were in a brown, four-door Chevrolet station wagon with 
damage to the right rear, Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Cota drove into the parking lot of the Golden Burger and 
ran inside, holding the toddler to his chest, Yu and other witnesses said. 
Stunned customers hurried to the counter where Cota stood sobbing and yelling 
for an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yu said Cota showed her at least one bullet wound to his temple but kept 
repeating that he was concerned only about his son. "He was saying, 'Please 
hurry, please, oh my God, the baby,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When paramedics arrived and separated father and son, the toddler began 
screaming, she said. They were taken away in different ambulances and airlifted 
to the trauma center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned customers gathered outside the restaurant to discuss the shooting, Yu 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to think of the mentality of the person who shot them, that a little 
infant toddler was in the middle of all of this," Yu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like life has no value anymore. This world is getting scarier."

BARRETO HAS EMERGED AS PROMINENT LATINO VOICE; POLITICS: SHE DEVELOPS LINK 
BETWEEN OXNARD SCHOOL BOARD AND CONSTITUENTS. SHE BELIEVES THAT HER COMMUNITY 
FOLLOWING STEMS FROM COMMON EXPERIENCES.

 The day Oxnard school board member Mary Barreto graduated from high school, 
her father told her that he had saved $2,000 for her to spend one of two ways: 
to go to college or to fix her teeth, which she described as "hopelessly 
crooked." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the gawky 1950s teen-ager was intent upon becoming an airline 
stewardess, the choice was simple -- she went to college. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision, Barreto later realized, set the tone for her life. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a secretary for 16 years, she bound books, she taught kindergarten and 
she hosted an Oxnard radio show. But whenever given the chance, the soft-spoken 
single mother returned to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. in psychology, became a family 
counselor and two years ago entered politics with a successful bid for the 
Oxnard school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by publicity from a racially charged struggle on the board, the 
self-described political amateur has emerged from the periphery into a 
prominent circle of Oxnard politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 As only the third Latino member of the school board, in spite of a student 
population that is nearly 80% Latino, Barreto, 58, is credited with developing 
a link between the board and its constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's lived the Hispanic experience," district Supt. Norman Brekke said. "She 
can express, with those thoughts in mind, what would most effectively address 
the needs of the Hispanic community." 
</P>
<P>
 Her supporters say she has done that by supporting a host of bilingual 
education proposals, as well as the school breakfast program and the healthy 
start program, which provides health care to students who cannot afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She stands for everybody, but what is important is that she has stood up 
specifically for the Spanish-speaking people," said Pete Tafoya, an Oxnard 
representative on the board of the Ventura County Community College District. 
"She has, in a sense, become a role model." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Barreto said her following in the Latino community stems from common 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The American-born daughter of immigrant parents, Barreto grew up in East Los 
Angeles and said she lived a childhood that in many ways resembles that of 
students in Oxnard today. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto said her father, who worked as a farm laborer, truck driver and chef, 
always wanted the family to return to Mexico, but her mother wanted to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, her family spoke Spanish, but at school, her teachers pushed her to 
improve her English. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did things like work on my diction and articulation, making me repeat 
words over and over again to get rid of my accent," Barreto recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, her parents had different ideas of what was appropriate for a young 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from a culture where you're not supposed to be assertive," she said. 
"I remember I loved baseball, and I decided to go out for the team. When my 
mother found out, she called the school and complained. She said women were not 
supposed to do that kind of thing. And I was forced to give it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too bad. I was a darn good slugger." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Barreto said, the overwhelming memory of her childhood was the message 
she received both at home and at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message was pride," she said. "Pride in your work, in your education and 
in your culture." 
</P>
<P>
 And, she added, "pride in doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that emphasis, she said, that led her to Mt. St. Mary's College in Los 
Angeles, where she studied for two years until the $2,000 from her father ran 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent the next 20 years in various professions, including 16 as a 
secretary in Los Angeles, but she always sought to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
 When she moved with her husband and young son to Simi Valley, she began taking 
classes at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved school and was inspired to study more. When I decided to go for a 
degree, my husband said he objected, but I didn't think he would really have a 
problem with it," Barreto recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 She enrolled in a program at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, which 
allowed her to study counseling and psychology if she agreed to donate time to 
Camarillo State Hospital. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees there. 
</P>
<P>
 But the education took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would spend half the day at school and the other half working in the 
wards at Camarillo State Hospital," recalled Chuck Renta, a Los Angeles 
computer consultant who was Barreto's husband at the time. "It put a tremendous 
amount of pressure on her and, in turn, put pressure on our marriage. It was 
that combination that really hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto and Renta were divorced in 1976, leaving her to raise their son. 
</P>
<P>
 While her schooling at Cal Lutheran was free, Barreto says: "Whenever anyone 
asks me 'How much did your education cost?' I say it cost a husband." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Barreto received a Ph.D. in psychology from San Diego-based 
International College. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has been referred to in Oxnard almost exclusively as "Dr. Mary 
Barreto." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a title she chose, mainly because of the pride she takes in her 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I wouldn't use it because I didn't feel like I had it, like my 
education was finished," Barreto said. "But then I became aware of the 
importance. It sends a message to people that you are proud of what you've 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very proud of it," she said. "My grandmother was stoking wood in the 
hillsides of Michoacan and in two generations we've crossed the line. I'm proud 
of where I am, especially because of where I came from." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that pride, she said, that helped her respond when, in 1990, a group of 
friends looking for leadership in Oxnard's Latino community asked her to run 
for the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember we had an easel and we were putting names up there, and when her 
name was put up, we all knew we had the right person," said Irma Lopez, wife of 
Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez and a member of the Latino Coalition for Fair 
Representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been saying for years that we wanted someone on that board who could 
share the same cultural experiences that the children were having," Irma Lopez 
recalled. "She just took the ball and ran with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto said she recognized immediately the need for representation on the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an understanding of those children that is unique because of my 
childhood," Barreto said. "I think that is evident in the programs I have 
supported over the past few years. I know how important these issues of 
language and culture and pride are to the Hispanic community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That shows in Barreto's work on the school board, Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that this is a very personal effort for her," Brekke said. 
But, he added, that does not always mean that she can persuade the board that 
the programs she supports are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke said a difference in philosophy between Barreto and longtime board 
member Jack Fowler has accounted for much of the tension in the boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto pushes for such special programs as school breakfast, health clinics 
and bilingual education. Fowler has been an opponent of almost every program 
that does not deal directly with educating children. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto calls Fowler a bully, saying the two argue frequently in closed 
session and that tension occasionally spills into the boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what he thought of Barreto, Fowler said: "If you don't have 
anything nice to say, don't say anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Late one evening in mid-November, after the end of a long closed-session, 
Barreto was handed a letter signed by Fowler and trustees Jim Suter and 
Dorothie Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a laundry list of complaints against her. 
</P>
<P>
 * She had not introduced them at the dedication of Cesar Chavez School. 
</P>
<P>
 * She had spoken at length in Spanish during meetings without translating. 
</P>
<P>
 * She had been "overly accommodating to those who do not speak English." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stunned," Barreto said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three board members said the issue needed to be laid out in a letter 
because numerous attempts to settle the dispute had failed. They called the 
letter "constructive criticism" that was meant to be private. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we would raise something like this (in person), she would get up 
and leave the room," Fowler said. "It was childish." 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto's response to the letter was to read it publicly, emphasizing the 
portion of the letter that accused her of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have been too flamboyant in representing myself as a Mexican, as a 
Chicano, then I have been misinterpreted," she said at a board meeting packed 
with her supporters. "But if I have acted in an arrogant way, it is because I 
believe myself to be an equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto described the feeling of standing up to the other board members as 
empowering.  
</P>
<P>
 Her actions elicited similar emotions in Oxnard's Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and community leaders appeared at board meetings in droves to defend 
Barreto and to condemn Fowler, Suter and Sterling as insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish-language media jumped on the story, sending television crews and 
reporters to meetings that had once been of little interest. 
</P>
<P>
 After several weeks and a promise from the board that members would meet with 
a counselor, the crowds and the attention dwindled. Suter, the board's new 
president, said he hopes that the counseling session will move board members 
past the feud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders in the Latino community said what is really needed to end the 
problem is a new balance on the board. Last year's struggles have sparked early 
interest in November's election, where three of the board's five seats, 
including those held by Barreto and Fowler, will be contested. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto will run again, but community leaders have begun to ask her about her 
interest in a higher office. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, says Art Hernandez, co-chairman of the Latino 
Coalition for Fair Representation, Barreto has grown in stature as a leader in 
the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 She sits on a state advisory committee on education and has been honored by 
several local groups, including receiving this year's El Concilio del Condado 
de Ventura Latino Leadership Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very happy with her work on the school board, but of course we will 
push her to consider other positions," Hernandez said. Added Irma Lopez: "I 
would think that she would do a wonderful job in any position." 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto, however, remains quiet about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the only way I'll try for something else is if they tell me I can't 
do it," she said.

DOORS CLOSE AT FILLMORE'S QUAKE SHELTER; AFTERMATH: THE REMAINING VICTIMS ARE 
RELOCATED TO A NEARBY HOTEL AND GIVEN ONE MORE WEEK TO FIND OTHER LODGING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pedro Barajas, his wife and six children packed all their belongings into his 
minivan Sunday and set out in search of a home. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past month, since the Northridge earthquake took both his job and his 
home, Barajas has spent his nights on a blue canvas cot, staring up at 
basketball hoops and the electronic scoreboard at the Fillmore Middle School 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday, Red Cross officials closed the doors of the gym, which had served 
as the county's largest shelter for earthquake victims. Barajas and 37 other 
earthquake victims were moved into a nearby hotel and will be given one more 
week to find other lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be leaving," said Barajas, who was the manager of the condemned 
Fillmore Hotel. "I thought we'd never leave this place." 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter, which had been a temporary home to more than 100 families, housed 
just seven families last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials said it would be cheaper now to move the families into the 
Best Western hotel. It is also more sanitary, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have that many people living together in one place for too long, 
you risk spreading communicable diseases," said Sharon Whitman, the shelter's 
volunteer nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the remaining quake victims were anxious to leave Sunday, but some 
have had difficulty finding a permanent home to accommodate their large 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough finding a landlord who will rent to a big family," said Juan 
Carrion, who left the shelter with his wife and three children Sunday 
afternoon. "We've found a place now, but we can't move in until March." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Carrions moved to Fillmore seven months ago and lived in a small house 
near Central Avenue. It received moderate earthquake damage and will be 
habitable once it is repaired, but Juan's wife Stella does not want to go back. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's too frightened to go back in," 15-year-old Maribel Carrion said. "There 
might be another earthquake, and now the house is not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrion said his family has been counting the days until the month ends and 
they can move into their new Fillmore home. 
</P>
<P>
 While they said they were grateful that the Red Cross set up the shelter after 
the earthquake, the Carrions said life there has not been very comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't use the showers some days, and it's tough living with all these 
people around," Maribel said. "We're glad we won't have to share everything 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims at the shelter used portable showers, drank water carried in by two 
tanker trucks, and shared six outhouses that were set up on an empty dirt lot 
in front of the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Irene Fulesday spent the morning dishing out the last bowls of 
chili and preparing care packages for the departing families. Unused food and 
supplies will be donated to area charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all kinds of things, like formula, diapers, bandages, emergency 
first-aid kits and other things which we're going to be distributing in 
Fillmore," Whitman said. "All of this stuff was donated to us, so we just want 
to make sure it gets to people who need it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fulesday also counted cots and arranged for the Red Cross to take them away to 
be fumigated and stored for the next disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a rough year," Fulesday said. She and her husband had just returned 
to their rural Pennsylvania home from the flooding in the Midwest when they 
were called in to help the earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad we had the chance to help people here," Elmer Fulesday said. "And 
we look at the bright side of things. When we left home, it was six degrees 
below zero. When we get back, the snow will be melting."

HATCHERIES HELP SATISFY APPETITES OF AREA ANGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A huge truck and trailer backs slowly down the boat-launching ramp at Lake 
Piru. A pipe in back spills the truck's contents into the still water -- much 
to the satisfaction of local anglers waiting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the pipe flow thousands of hungry, hatchery-raised fish. Even before 
workers finish emptying the truck's contents, a smiling fisherman hauls in a 
six-inch rainbow trout. 
</P>
<P>
 That fish, transported to the lake by state Department of Fish and Game 
employees from the Fillmore Fish Hatchery, has met its destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all part of the 'put-and-take' fishery," said Jim Adams, director of the 
hatchery. "We put the fish in and the anglers take them out." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a busy season for Adams and the seven other workers at the hatchery. 
For the next two months, they will spend much of their time transporting fish 
to lakes and streams from Lake Castaic to Atascadero, using specially equipped 
tanks loaded with thousands of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rainy season is our busiest time," Adams said. Fish raised during the 
summer and fall are released during winter and spring, when wet weather 
increases the amount of water to sustain them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The workers' goal each year is to transplant close to 1 million young fish for 
the enjoyment of anglers throughout Southern California. It may not be nature's 
way, but hatchery operators say the put-and-take system preserves wild stocks 
of fish by taking the brunt of pressure from anglers. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the conception of mankind, people have always wanted to do some 
fishing," Adams said. "Natural stocks just couldn't keep up. That's why the 
Department of Fish and Game started helping out with hatcheries 100 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the $25 fishing-license fee that anglers pay helps fund the $3-million 
budget for the six hatcheries in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, however, voice concern over California's reliance on 
hatchery-raised fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people don't see beyond the short-term benefits of catching more 
fish," said Mark Capelli, executive director of Friends of the Ventura River. 
"It's an artificial way of getting around the fact that many of these water 
bodies cannot sustain fish populations." 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli said the hatchery fish, because of their weak and limited gene pools, 
are more susceptible to disease, which in turn can spread into native fish 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fish from hatcheries are caught within two weeks of being 
transported to their new homes, Adams said. About 10% die from the shock of 
dropping in to a new environment. A few elude anglers and even spawn if they 
find cool and clear running water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in most cases, the fish wind up at the end of an angler's hook. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old Fillmore trout hatchery is one of 11 in California. It is the 
primary source for hatchery trout in Ventura, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and 
San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the 900,000 fish that are stocked by the hatchery each year start their 
lives at a hatchery in Bishop, where fish eggs are fertilized and incubated 
before being shipped to Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 30 days after fertilization, the eggs hatch into fish about as long as 
a finger is wide. For the next 10 or 11 months, hatchery personnel feed and 
nurture the fish in four 1,000-foot-long, concrete-lined pools. The water is 
kept moving to prevent stagnation and, every few feet, a pump bubbles oxygen 
into the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent the small fingerlings from being eaten by larger fish, the hatchery 
staff keep the small fish in separate pools. 
</P>
<P>
 At feeding time, the fish rise en masse , giving the surface the appearance of 
boiling water as they gorge themselves on food pellets made from the unused 
parts of processed fish. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year of pampering, the fish are ready to be taken to lakes and streams 
in mobile tanks equipped with oxygen pumps. The fish have grown to about six or 
seven inches in length and weigh about half a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Anglers are usually ready when the fish arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get them calling here asking when the next plant of hatchery fish is 
coming," said Peter Cervantez, who works at the bait shop at Lake Piru. 
"Sometimes they're lucky and time it just when the truck arrives."

STREET SMART: SEARCHING FOR A GOOD REASON FOR A BAD SENSE OF TIMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As a resident of Thousand Oaks, I appreciate the added safety at Moorpark Road 
and the Ventura Freeway since traffic lights were installed about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the timing on these traffic lights seems to be off. Right now, 
driving through them means stopping two or three times. 
</P>
<P>
 I've come up with a couple of things that could be done to improve this 
situation. At the eastbound freeway off-ramp, traffic heading south on Moorpark 
Road is stopped by a red light even though the signal for oncoming traffic is 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the city make the southbound light green at the same time that the 
northbound light is green? 
</P>
<P>
 My second question has to do with the westbound freeway off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 During rush hour, traffic exiting the freeway is controlled by a left-turn 
arrow. But motorists who drive through this light when it turns green 
immediately hit a red light at southbound Moorpark Road, causing traffic to 
back up. 
</P>
<P>
 Could these two signals be linked to change color at the same time? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Shum 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to your first question is no, and to your second question maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it is not possible to make the traffic signals for opposing traffic on 
Moorpark Road the same color at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights are timed differently because of the heavy flow of southbound 
traffic turning onto the Ventura Freeway. There are two left-turn lanes to 
handle this flow, says Thousand Oaks Traffic Engineer John Helliwell. If the 
lights were green for the same interval, cars turning left would not have 
enough time to get through the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to your second question, Helliwell says it may be possible to adjust 
the timing of the lights to allow motorists to get through both lights without 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Helliwell says he will send traffic crews out to check the timing and see if 
the adjustment can be made without disrupting the flow of traffic at other 
nearby intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There is a problem with speeding traffic on Foothill Road at Via Plaza in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 When I am at the stop sign on Via Plaza trying to get onto Foothill, I face a 
stream of cars speeding an average of 20 miles over the posted 40 m.p.h. speed 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 A slight upward slope east on Foothill makes it hard to see much of this 
traffic. After a full stop at the stop sign on Via Plaza, I have to creep out 
onto Foothill to get a good view of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I make it onto Foothill, I have to accelerate very fast to avoid getting 
smashed by someone zooming up from behind. Now and then, I get honked at for 
not being fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Could a stop light be installed or speed bumps placed on Foothill to slow the 
traffic? Perhaps the speed limit could be lowered to 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, at the very least, how about a sign warning motorists on Foothill of cross 
traffic ahead? 
</P>
<P>
 Elisa Gottheil-Luciani 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Warning signs on Foothill Road near Via Plaza are definitely possible, says 
Ventura Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalani says he will put in a request for the warning signs. But none of your 
other suggestions would work. It is generally against city policy to install 
speed bumps, especially on streets with high speed limits and heavy traffic 
flow, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And because of the volume of traffic, it would be imprudent to lower the speed 
limit, which could cause traffic backups. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for the intersection to qualify for a traffic signal, it would have 
to meet strict state guidelines for traffic and pedestrian volume, Lalani says. 
He says he will check out the intersection to see if it would meet the 
requirements, but that is not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I know of that intersection, I suspect it has a high volume of 
traffic, but not enough to meet the requirements," Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the recent reopening of the nearby Kimball Road ramp onto the Santa 
Paula Freeway may alleviate some of the traffic problems, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many motorists, unable to enter the freeway at Kimball, were driving down 
Foothill, causing greater than normal congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As residents of Somis, we'd like to know if signs can be posted on the Ventura 
Freeway letting people know how to get to our community. 
</P>
<P>
 If possible, there should be a sign on the freeway as one approaches Las Posas 
Road in Camarillo. Another sign should be posted at the end of the Las Posas 
off-ramp and another at Las Posas and Crestview Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 All signs should indicate the number of miles to Somis. Somisites and 
residents of Las Posas Valley would welcome these signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara and Jack Fulkerson 
</P>
<P>
 Somis 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation and the city of Camarillo both have 
reasons for not wanting to post signs showing the way to Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Ventura Freeway, Caltrans would be responsible for posting signs to let 
motorists know how to get to the community. Caltrans Maintenance Supervisor 
Dave Servaes says the agency has not placed Somis signs on the freeway because 
the area is too far away. 
</P>
<P>
 But faithful Street Smart readers may recall a question some months ago from a 
reader wondering why a sign to Port Hueneme was posted at the Ventura Freeway's 
Seaward Avenue exit -- many miles from that city. 
</P>
<P>
 Servaes explained that Port Hueneme's city status qualified it for freeway 
signs, while Somis is an unincorporated community.

 Camarillo is reluctant to post signs to Somis at Las Posas and Crestview 
because it does not want to encourage trucks to use that route, City Engineer 
Tom Fox says. "The goal is to minimize traffic on local streets, and posting a 
sign would defeat that purpose."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; NEIGHBORS POLLED OVER FIREWORKS SHOW

 Residents near Ventura College are being polled to see if they object to a 
proposed July 4 fireworks show at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The college and the Ventura Rotary Club are considering putting on the show, 
which would be the first Independence Day fireworks display in the city since 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The show would be staged on the college's softball field, and tickets would be 
sold for seating in the fenced area, according to a flyer seeking neighbors' 
comments. Neighbors would each receive two complimentary tickets. Security and 
supervised parking would be provided; alcohol would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need the cooperation of all the neighbors," said Norman Blacher, 
president-elect of the Ventura Rotary Club. "We're hoping they would go along."

VIETNAMESE MARK NEW LIVES IN U.S. IN LATE TET FESTIVAL; NEW YEAR: MORE THAN 
4,000, MANY FORMER POLITICAL PRISONERS, GATHER IN BUENA PARK TO CELEBRATE THEIR 
IMMIGRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 4,000 people, many of them former Vietnamese political prisoners, 
gathered Sunday to celebrate their successful immigration to the United States, 
hope for a better life, and belatedly mark the Vietnamese new year. 
</P>
<P>
 The overflowing throng enjoying the festivities in a cavernous union hall was 
brought together by the Westminster-based Vietnam Political Detainees Mutual 
Assn., which has sponsored hundreds of immigrants in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those celebrating the luncheon, music and speeches was Huu Hanh Vo, 61, 
a former Army colonel for the Republic of South Vietnam who arrived in the 
United States in January. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former military leader and author of a book praising "the heroic fight 
for Democracy," he had been imprisoned in Vietnam for 13 years in a 
"re-education" camp after the government of the south was overthrown in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after his release from prison in 1988, the Communist Vietnamese 
government "didn't give me a chance to work" and confiscated his property, Vo 
said through an interpreter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But under a 1989 agreement between Hanoi and Washington, Vo and as many as 
130,000 other former political detainees and their families have immigrated to 
the United States and a new life, according to the event's organizers. Vo, who 
lives in Westminster, arrived here with his wife and four children. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 9,000 of the former political prisoners and their families have 
settled in Orange County, government officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sunday's celebration got underway in the union hall of Buena Park's United 
Food and Commercial Workers Local 324, a beaming Vo said he would like to send 
a New Year's greeting to Vietnam-era U.S. veterans with whom he worked closely 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 This marked the fourth consecutive year that the Vietnam Political Detainees 
Mutual Assn. has held Tet -- the Vietnamese new year -- festivities for 
immigrants, known as H.O. people, an acronym for the Humanitarian Operation, 
the program that brought them to the United States. Sunday's gathering, a 
belated observance of the Vietnamese lunar new year, was the largest yet.  
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which is run by volunteers and operates on donated funds, 
helps file documents, picks up newcomers from airports, arranges housing and 
medical assistance and assists with a variety of other tasks for the largely 
non-English speaking immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizer Nguyen Hau estimated that so far only about half the eligible 
political detainees from Vietnam have come to this country. Many, however, have 
left their homeland and live in interim refugee camps elsewhere in Southeast 
Asia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants arriving under the Humanitarian Operation agree to reimburse the 
U.S. government for the transportation costs, said Phuong Nguyen Le, who 
arrived here under the program three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Le, who works as a bilingual coordinator for the Garden Grove Unified School 
District, said he has repaid his debt. Le arrived in the United States with his 
parents and two sisters. A third sister attempted to leave Vietnam for America 
before the Humanitarian Operation was implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 "She tried to escape from the country by herself," Le recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But his sister was lost when the boat she shared with 150 other refugees 
disappeared in the Gulf of Thailand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the speakers at Sunday's luncheon was Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San 
Jose), a candidate for state controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias, whose parents were Portuguese, said he had come to speak about "my own 
family's immigration" to the United States at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 As a product of a home in which many family members did not speak English, 
Areias said he felt a common bond with the H.O. people who had filled the hall.

SLEEPING MAN ROLLS OVER ONTO BABY DAUGHTER, CRITICALLY INJURING HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man sleeping in bed next to his 2-month-old daughter Sunday accidentally 
rolled over onto the baby, crushing her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant remained in critical condition at Children's Hospital of Orange 
County, according to police investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they got a frantic call about 12:25 a.m. from the child's mother, 
who lives in the 200 block of Avocado Street. 
</P>
<P>
 She had just returned home from work, awakened her husband and discovered the 
infant pinned beneath him. The child, she told police, had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 A dispatcher instructed the parents on how to perform cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation on the child, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of officers arrived minutes later and continued efforts to revive the 
baby until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant was first taken to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, then moved to 
Children's Hospital in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to release the names of the parents until the investigation is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the incident appears to have been a freak accident.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; DAMAGED COLLEGE LIBRARY TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark College library is scheduled to reopen Tuesday after a month of 
work to repair damage sustained in the Jan. 17 earthquake, part of $100,000 in 
damage across the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Loose and fallen plaster from the building's central ceiling and cracked walls 
had to be repaired, and 3,000 books that spilled onto the floor had to be 
replaced before the main section of the library could reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 It was declared structurally safe earlier this month, but has remained closed 
while workers replaced overhead lights in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the library's upstairs classrooms, which suffered only cosmetic 
damage, have been in use since Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to library work, the college also had to repair damage at the 
gymnasium, where overhead lighting fixtures came loose and fell onto support 
beams, and where an air-conditioning duct crashed to the floor. The gym was 
reopened by the first week of February. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; GOODWILL TO BROADEN SCOPE OF PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new and expanded Goodwill building in Oxnard, which is celebrating with an 
open house today, will allow the organization to train more disabled workers 
and accept more contracts for manufacturing, assembly, packaging and other 
work, Goodwill authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the 120 clients who are employed or being trained by Goodwill have 
barriers to employment, including physical or mental disabilities, or language 
problems, said J. J. Rippner, production supervisor at the new Goodwill 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We train the people and then have a job coach stay with them at least a few 
hours a day for the first few weeks on the job," Rippner said. "People have to 
have patience with our people and accept them for who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Thompson, 32, who works for Goodwill unloading trucks, will soon be 
trained at the new facility for other work, possibly in the janitorial field, 
Rippner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who graduated from Buena High School in 1983, said he is ready to 
learn a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goodwill helped me learn to do this," he said of unloading trucks filled with 
donated merchandise. "But now I want to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 The open house and tours of the building at 330 Cactus Drive will be held from 
9 a.m. to 1 p.m., including a free pancake breakfast for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will allow Goodwill to expand its existing rehabilitation 
services as well as introduce several new programs. The organization offers a 
computer class to train people to work in data entry, with 15 clients now 
enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwill also employs people to repair bicycles, test appliances to see if 
they operate well enough to be sold at the organization's thrift stores, sort 
books and repair shoes, Rippner said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Goodwill is looking for contracts from businesses that need collating, 
packaging or assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Goodwill Industries office, governed by a local board of directors and 
funded through donations, is a resource that belongs to the community, said 
Nick Panza, president of the Ventura and Santa Barbara county chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always stress accountability to the local community, especially in using 
the resources we are given in a responsible way," Panza said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; BOARD WILL DECIDE BIRTH CONTROL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of debate, Simi Valley school officials are scheduled on Tuesday 
to decide whether to add birth control information to the sex education 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens committee formed to study the issue in December recommended adding 
such information to lessons in seventh and 10th grades.The panel also said 
school officials should better teach students how to practice abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents on both sides of the issue have turned out at nearly every school 
board meeting since the committee held its first talks in September. The 
25-member committee was comprised by teachers, administrators, parents and 
religious representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the birth control issue, the school board is scheduled to take 
up more budget cuts at Tuesday's meeting. However, officials expect the birth 
control debate to last so long that the meeting will be continued to Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to pass a proposal to cut all operational budgets by 8% 
to save $150,000 a year. However, officials dumped a plan to move high school 
athletics from sixth-period to after school so that fees could be charged to 
parents for transportation to sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, sports programs districtwide will be asked to find ways to cut 
$100,000 from the budget through fund-raisers and other initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night's meeting will be preceded by a public forum at the school 
district offices on Cochran Street at 4 p.m. The regular board meeting will 
begin one hour early, at 6 p.m., in the council chambers at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting will be 6 p.m. at Berylwood Elementary School. BRENDA DAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON WETLANDS PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council will vote Tuesday on a fiercely debated 
ordinance aimed at prohibiting development near the city's wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, narrowly approved by the Planning Commission earlier this month 
after seven hours of debate, includes steps to protect a handful of known 
wetland areas.Opponents of the ordinance plan to take their case to the City 
Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real issue that should be before the council is whether this ordinance is 
necessary at all," said Ellen Michiel, vice president of Raznik & Sons, a 
property holder that would be prevented by the ordinance from building on part 
of its property. "I'm not sure this ordinance accomplishes anything other than 
to put into place a very bad law."  
</P>
<P>
 At the Planning Commission meeting, property owners argued that the plan 
duplicated existing state and federal regulations. They also said the ordinance 
constituted a partial taking of their land, and they threatened to sue the city 
if the plan became law. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three commissioners who supported the ordinance said that protecting a 
pristine wetlands environment was their overriding goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Elois Zeanah said that would be her goal as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ordinance is long overdue given the state of our wetlands," Zeanah said. 
"This city prides itself on its conservation policy, and I think this ordinance 
just brings us up to date on maintaining pristine land that is fast 
disappearing." MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STORM CLOUDS TO GIVE WAY TO CLEAR SKIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The storm clouds that dropped nearly two inches of rain on Ventura County 
early Sunday are expected to clear today, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the heavy rains, homes on hillsides stripped bare of vegetation in the 
fall fires suffered no apparent damage from mudslides or flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's patrols drove through Hidden Valley and Carlisle Canyon on Sunday 
morning in search of potential flood damage, but a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman said sandbags placed in those areas in December held back the mud and 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, snow generated from the Alaskan storm fell in altitudes as low as 
3,000 feet, forcing the closure of a portion of California 33 north of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 About six inches of new snow blanketed the Pine Mountain area Saturday night 
and Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is expected to be the coldest day of the storm, with overnight lows 
dipping into the 30s and daytime highs in the 50s, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures should rise into the 60s and 70s later this week as the Alaskan 
storm leaves the area. 
</P>
<P>
 '(This) afternoon, you can expect dry conditions and clear skies," said Bruce 
Thoren, a meteorologist at Weather Data Inc. "The brunt of the storm has 
definitely passed." MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY ISSUE: OIL PIPELINE REGULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of major oil spills that fouled the ecologically sensitive Santa 
Clara River and the wetlands along McGrath Lake in Ventura County, Assemblyman 
Jack  
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) is proposing strict new regulations for oil 
pipelines. Are such regulations needed, and will they prevent future spills? 
</P>
<P>
 * Alan Godley 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalist, owner of Blue Dolphin environmental store in Ventura 
Something needs to be done to protect these very sensitive areas. The steelhead 
that depend on the Santa Clara River, for instance, are in such a stressed 
state that they can't rebound if a spill occurs and are vulnerable to 
extinction. At the very least, we should have maps of where the new and old 
pipelines are, so we know where they cross sensitive habitat. It's those 
pipelines that should be regularly monitored. If an earthquake occurs, crews 
should be out there immediately looking for cracks, just as crews check bridges 
and highway overpasses. In the case of the Christmas (Eve) spill (at McGrath 
Lake), there was human error involved, too. It took almost five days before 
anyone even knew there was a leak. We should make every effort to prevent such 
mistakes through more frequent monitoring. We should know if a pipeline is too 
old and stressed. I don't know how long pipelines can be used safely; it's not 
my industry, but I know they corrode over time. There should be some sort of 
standard set stating when pipelines should be replaced. I know they can't carry 
oil forever without breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Terry Covington 
</P>
<P>
 Western States Petroleum Assn. in Santa Barbara  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We at Western States Petroleum believe a call for new regulations at this 
point in time is premature. It is not clear that additional regulations imposed 
on all companies across-the-board is necessary. It is also not clear that it 
would provide any additional benefit or could have prevented these incidents. 
It is important to note that this (the Santa Clara spill) was the only pipeline 
break from the devastating earthquake in the whole area. The most important 
effort now should be to determine what caused the spills and what corrective 
action is necessary. Once this information is obtained, it will be useful to 
the regulatory agencies who oversee our onshore activities as well as the 
companies that have onshore operations. The review being conducted by state 
agencies to examine current preventive inspection and maintenance and response 
measures in our opinion is the most constructive response. Perhaps the role of 
the Legislature should be to oversee communication and notification procedures 
among existing state and local agencies.

 The oil spills were a tragedy, but I think there is a tendency to overreact 
after accidents like these. We could have legislation left and right that would 
cost taxpayers lots of money and not really do much. I would rather take a 
careful approach on this. We have a system that works 99% of the time. It 
didn't work well during the Christmas (Eve) spill, and maybe we should have 
better monitoring of pipelines in sensitive areas, but I would hope that the 
state would consult with industry and local officials before they enact any new 
legislation. Ventura is laced with pipelines, and accidents are bound to 
happen. What seems most important is that we don't have the miscommunication 
between the various agencies that we had during the (McGrath Lake) spill. No 
one seemed to know who was in charge. We can't have that, but we should be 
cautious in pushing for more government regulation.

 As always, my primary concern is that we prevent the kind of tragic spill I 
saw at McGrath Lake. The one thing that became clear after the McGrath incident 
is that no one knows how many old pipes are out there ready to rupture. The 
fact that it took days to notice and react to the pipeline break also 
underscores a critical and immediate need for increased site monitoring and 
significant retraining in appropriate notification procedures. The Department 
of Fish and Game's Oil Spill Prevention and Response team is compiling a 
comprehensive inventory of the number and type of pipelines, especially those 
along our fragile coastline. As this issue continues to develop and as our 
questions get answered, I will be moving forward with legislation designed to 
address construction and inspection standards that will tangibly increase 
pipeline spill prevention efforts.

 There are hundreds of miles of pipeline out there, and more are being added 
all the time. The oil companies don't want to make the capital investments to 
modernize all that older equipment even though it's in their best interest. 
It's like the arguments over double-lined tankers: Instead of justifying the 
expense, they're looking at a bell curve that says the probability of a major 
break is very low. The earthquake alone should justify precautions. Accidents 
and disasters happen. We should take action to make those pipelines as safe as 
they can be, including regular monitoring. We should make sure that if a break 
occurs, it doesn't dump into sensitive areas like the Santa Clara River. That's 
probably one of the most sensitive areas in the county. We don't want to lose 
it. Right now, we rely on the oil companies to monitor themselves. It's the old 
fox guarding the chicken coop. I don't know if new regulations will stop spills 
altogether, but it would be a move in that direction.

 The Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board has set up a hot line for 
Ventura County businesses seeking information about waste discharge 
requirements and other water-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line, coupled with a new business assistance office, will enable 
callers to speak with the board's staff between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board's goal in setting up this office is to help the public and the 
regulated community get through the permitting process quickly and 
efficiently," said Robert Ghirelli, regional board executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make the process less burdensome for the public by helping people 
make sense out of the water quality rules and regulations with which they must 
comply," he said in a statement released by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board oversees permitting and regulation of issues relating to waste 
discharge and water quality in Ventura County.

BUFFALO SHUFFLE OFF; REMAINING BISON AT OLD IRVINE THEME PARK SITE SOLD TO MAKE 
WAY FOR ROAD REALIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 His name is Happy and he's a 1,600-pound American bison. On Sunday, he was 
chomping on alfalfa strands while an auctioneer's rapid-fire cadences pierced 
the air here. 
</P>
<P>
 The auctioneer, standing on a bale of hay, sang, "$2,000, $2,000, do I hear 
$2,100?" 
</P>
<P>
 Happy took a few more bites, then shook his head with such force that dried 
mud flew off his furry mane, creating a ring of dust around his head and horns. 
</P>
<P>
 When the auctioneer finally announced, "Sold for $2,000!" Happy and fellow 
bison Lucky and Rainbow were rolling in the muddy pasture, unaware that they 
had just been sold, unaware that a long tradition in Orange County had just 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 To make way for the realignment of Ford Road, the remaining buffalo at the 
Buffalo Ranch, a defunct 1950s theme park that has been an office complex for 
years, were sold by owner William Lange with all proceeds going to local 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Cogorno, a Westminster criminal defense attorney and part-time 
rancher, bought the burly bison for his 10-acre ranch in Lancaster. Cogorno 
said he is fulfilling a dream to own a true American original and to start his 
own herd of buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved the West and am happy to be buying and preserving a part of 
it," Cogorno, 48, said. He said he wants to breed the animals, then move them 
to a larger ranch in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of Happy, Lucky and Rainbow ends the long role in local history 
buffalo have played at MacArthur Boulevard and Ford Road. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1950s, innovative entrepreneur Gene Clark imported 100 bison from 
Kansas and released the herd onto 100 acres of the hilly terrain he rented from 
the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to create one of Orange County's first theme parks, Clark added a 
kiddie train ride on the property, set up an Indian village, kept livestock in 
a barn and sold buffalo burgers and handicrafts from his newly named "Buffalo 
Ranch." People paid per carload to drive across a winding road on the property 
in a Lion Country Safari-type experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Historical Society President Bill Grundy, 70, remembers taking a 
carful of kids through the ranch when it was in its prime.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a Ford convertible at the time, and I remember once there was a big 
bull on one side and the herd on the other. I drove in the middle and the bull 
got so close to the car, I could see it frothing. I said, 'Look, kids,' but 
they were on the floorboard, hiding behind the seats," Grundy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Ranch was short-lived. In a few years, all that remained was an 
empty red barn and adjoining silo. Clark sent all the buffalo back to Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings sat unused until architect William L. Pereira drove past the 
facility in 1960 while working on the master development plans for the city of 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Pereira, whose works included the Transamerica Building in San Francisco and 
Los Angeles International Airport, fell in love with the barn's rustic charm 
and he moved in drafting tables to create a satellite office of William L. 
Pereira Associates. He later added several smaller barrack-style buildings to 
the site.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Pereira sold the buildings to William Lange, who has since 
headquartered his real estate business at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, Lange brought two buffalo from Colorado to a corral behind 
the five-acre property to revive the buffalo's heritage at the site and to give 
his young children a taste of the country, Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., which still owns the land, will not extend Lange's lease when 
it expires this month. Instead, Lange is moving his offices to a newer building 
in Newport Beach, and the land will be used for the realignment of Ford Road, 
which will eventually connect with the 15-mile San Joaquin Transportation 
Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 The red ranch-style buildings have been designated as historic structures and 
are protected from demolition. An Irvine Co. spokeswoman said the firm is still 
deciding what to do with the land. 
</P>
<P>
 When he decided to sell the buffalo, Lange wanted to make sure the animals 
would be kept alive. To qualify, bidders first had to guarantee that no bison 
would be slaughtered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would've taken $500, if it was the only bid which I knew for sure the bison 
would be taken care of," Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cogorno said he would never consider entering the lucrative buffalo meat 
market. "I can't imagine killing something so beautiful, so American," he said.

2 ROBBERIES UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies late Sunday were investigating two armed robberies that 
occurred half an hour apart at a liquor store and convenience market in the 
Montalvo and Saticoy areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The first occurred at 6:30 p.m. at Log Cabin Liquor on Alameda Avenue in 
Montalvo.The second happened at 6:55 p.m. at Le Town market on Azahar Street in 
Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 In both robberies, two suspects entered the store brandishing handguns. The 
owner or employees were then ordered to lie on the floor while one of the 
suspects scooped money from the till. During the second robbery, the suspects 
spoke Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Gary Backman said everything about the two robberies appeared 
similar except for the description of the suspects' ethnicity. The victims of 
the first robbery described the robbers as white males in their teens. In the 
second robbery, the suspects were said to be Latino males in their late teens.

QUAKE, STABBING SPUR NEW FUNDING; SIMI VALLEY: CITY BRACES FOR FUTURE 
EMERGENCIES BY UPDATING COMPUTER SYSTEMS, SHORING UP POLICE SERVICES. OFFICIALS 
SAY THEY ARE IN GOOD POSITION TO COVER $800,000 COST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Still recovering from the double shock of the earthquake and the recent 
stabbing of a junior high school student, Simi Valley officials are bracing for 
future emergencies by modernizing the city's computer systems and beefing up 
police services. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing lower-than-expected spending and slightly higher revenue for the first 
half of the fiscal year, city officials said they are in a good financial 
position to spend the more than $800,000 the programs are expected to cost. 
</P>
<P>
 From July to December, the city spent about $13 million from its general fund, 
about 8.5% less than budgeted. The fund took in $9.5 million, about 0.7% more 
than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we're in pretty good shape," Deputy City Manager Laura Herron said. 
"There were no big surprises." 
</P>
<P>
 The surprises came later, with the Jan. 17 earthquake that toppled buildings 
and ruptured water lines, followed by the Feb. 1 fatal stabbing of a Valley 
View Junior High School student. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's midyear spending plan recently approved by the City Council, 
Simi Valley will pay $400,000 to install a computer database that would map 
streets, buildings, and sewer and water systems throughout the city in minute 
detail. The system will allow the city to pinpoint leaks and other problems, 
and react quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $250,000 will be spent to upgrade the city's existing computer 
systems. The money will come from the general fund and from the sanitation and 
waterworks districts, which will directly benefit from the expanded system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to improve the computer systems have been under way for several months, 
but the earthquake gave City Council members an extra incentive to approve the 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to get this kind of computer system for years, and the 
earthquake gave us the jolt we needed to finally go ahead with it," Mayor Greg 
Stratton said. "We're in pretty good shape financially, so it seems like a good 
time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the city's financial health, the council decided to delay $1.2 million 
in road repaving until the summer, after the start of the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The street work must be done, but it's less of a priority right now, and most 
contractors are busy with earthquake projects anyway," Councilwoman Judy Mikels 
said. "The earthquake has made us realize that the computer improvements are 
not a luxury, but a necessity that we need to address." 
</P>
<P>
 The mapping program, called the Geographic Information System, will compile 
data from hundreds of aging paper maps onto one computer system, allowing the 
city to coordinate planning and locate trouble spots more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to pay $79,000 for the salaries of temporary employees 
who are providing earthquake-related services, such as building inspections and 
construction plan reviews. The city is hoping to be reimbursed for those costs 
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also spend $109,000 to improve Police Department services. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that amount, about $13,000 will be spent on backup emergency radio 
equipment. The city's emergency radio service, which operates at AM 530 as part 
of the Travellers Information Radio System, was knocked out for two weeks by 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $33,000 will pay the salaries two additional police dispatchers for 
four months. And $63,000 will pay for a second full-time officer to patrol all 
the city's public schools in the wake of the fatal stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 The two new dispatchers -- whose positions may be made permanent by the City 
Council when it adopts its budget for the next fiscal year, beginning July 1 -- 
will bring the total hired by the department to 13, about average for a city of 
102,000 residents, according to a study conducted by the Police Department.

TRAFFIC EXPECTED TO BE KEY TO MASSIVE HOUSING PROJECT; MOORPARK: UP TO 3,200 
PROPOSED HOMES MAY HINGE ON LINKING THE AREA TO THE REST OF THE CITY. PLAN MAY 
ALSO BE USED TO EASE EXISTING CONGESTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the design of a massive housing project that may eventually bring Moorpark 
up to 3,200 new homes begins to take shape, City Council members and the 
developer agree that one of their most complicated and significant battles may 
be waged over pavement: 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, how to best link the 4,000 acres owned by Messenger Investment 
Co. to the rest of the city, and how to use the development to remove as much 
traffic as possible from existing city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most complex aspect of this project is turning out to be the roads," 
Messenger Vice President Gary Austin said. "Because what they're going to try 
to do is fix some of the other regional transportation problems through this 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 And while the developer seeks to avoid assuming traffic -- particularly truck 
traffic -- that now winds its way through downtown Moorpark, city officials are 
sure to demand that Messenger play some role in reducing the heavy flow on 
existing streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bernardo Perez said Austin as much as promised that Messenger would 
assume some of that traffic when the company successfully lobbied to be 
included in the city's 1992 update of its General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a certain expectation that I now have based on their 
representations, and I think the community at large shares that expectation," 
Perez said. "If he is true to his word, then I expect that he is willing to 
contribute 100% to helping solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Messenger's strong desire to keep trucks off the main road that will 
traverse its property, defining the extent of the developer's contribution may 
be problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're saying is that, after looking at the topography and the character 
of the community that we're designing, we don't think it would be a good idea 
to make that road a truck route," Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the city decides that it has to have that as a truck route -- and it 
can certainly make that decision -- we think that the people who would move 
into the houses in the first phase of development would immediately go down to 
City Hall and ask them to change that designation." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they are faced with two main challenges as they begin to 
consider the Messenger road system: how best to design the major east-west 
corridor that will run across the land, and how extensively to link the 
development to the existing Campus Park neighborhood to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 "We face an important dichotomy in that we don't want to increase traffic 
through those areas by linking them up with Messenger," Councilman Scott 
Montgomery said. "But, on the other hand, we're looking to Messenger to provide 
additional benefits -- commercial development, schools, a police substation and 
a fire station -- and they're not going to do any good if people can't get to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Messenger officials last week submitted their first draft specific plan for 
the project, which shows a major east-west roadway running from Broadway east 
through their project and heading south to link up with the Simi Valley Freeway 
at a planned interchange east of Collins Drive and west of Alamos Canyon Road. 
The plan also shows three connections between the Messenger land and the 
existing Campus Park neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is still early in the planning process, city officials and 
representatives of the developer say, and those initial plans could be 
substantially altered on the way to city approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 One change that Messenger may explore, Austin said, is using the existing 
Collins Drive interchange to provide a freeway link for the new homes, allowing 
the developer to save the $6 million to $10 million it would have cost to build 
the new interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin said a preliminary traffic study indicates that Collins -- with some 
improvements -- could handle the additional traffic generated by up to 3,200 
new homes, and that avoiding construction of a new interchange would allow 
Messenger to commit those funds to the city for another road improvement 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way for the city to take some dollars that might have been allocated 
in one spot and put them in another spot," Austin said. "All of these things 
are kind of in a big bubble in everybody's head and they're all saying, 'Hmm.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The most logical target for the funds, he said, would probably be a westward 
expansion of the Simi Valley Freeway to Walnut Canyon Road, which would provide 
freeway truck access through the city and take the burden off surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The major question Moorpark officials would face is whether the state 
Department of Transportation would agree to fund such a freeway expansion soon, 
even with up to $10 million from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the long delays in the construction of the connector of the Simi 
Valley-Moorpark freeways and all the recent earthquake-related freeway damage 
now vying for state funds, council members may be unwilling to take that 
gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't see Caltrans coming up with the money to do that when there's so 
much needed to be done, retrofitting and other things, as a result of the 
earthquake," Montgomery said. "I'd be thrilled, but I'm not really expecting 
that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said he also was doubtful that the city would see such a project funded 
in the near future. Even if a freeway extension were approved, Perez wondered 
whether the city could accept the heavier traffic burden on Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear complaints from residents about drivers using that as an expressway 
now," he said. "Just north of the freeway, we have the college, Campus Canyon 
School, a park -- you would have a lot of users converging in that area. Maybe 
the numbers work, but in practice, is that something that we want to see?"

PERSPECTIVE ON DEFENSE; CLINTON'S STEALTH WEAPON: THE FEDERAL BUDGET; THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS PILING UP NEW TASKS WITHOUT NEW FUNDING; FORCE READINESS IS 
BOUND TO SUFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN O'KEEFE, Sean O'Keefe is a professor of business administration at 
Pennsylvania State University. He served as comptroller of defense before he 
was named secretary of the Navy in the Bush Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the closing moments of the President's stemwinder State of the Union 
address, he resolutely warned Congress that defense spending should not be cut 
below his budget proposal. But a close examination of the budget reality 
reveals factors that lead to a starkly opposite conclusion: It will be next to 
impossible to fulfill Clinton's pledge that during his tenure the armed forces 
will remain as ready and capable as he inherited. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50-billion disagreement between Budget Director Leon E. Panetta and 
former Defense Secretary Les Aspin was merely the tip of the iceberg. If 
anything, the seeds of this budgetary conflict were sown within weeks after the 
Clinton inaugural, when Panetta proposed, and Aspin was forced to accept, a set 
of budgetary assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the White House proposed that there be no cost-of-living adjustment for 
military and civilian federal employees. When Congress predictably balked and 
approved an average 3% pay increase last fall, that action raised the 
national-security cost about $15 billion. Similarly, last year's budget 
presentation assumed a virtually nonexistent inflation level over the next few 
years. While actual inflation has been low for some time, it hasn't been in the 
decimal dust range Panetta provided for. Last year's inflation figures are now 
in, and the impact is about $30 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 Both the pay and inflation consequences were predictable, but now serve to 
compound the problem. Taken separately, these adjustments should not require 
herculean efforts; after all, we're talking about estimates that span just 
about the balance of this decade and, in aggregate, represent more than $1.5 
trillion worth of programs. This ought to be chalked up as a reasonable 
management problem requiring year-to-year ingenuity and creativity as the 
successive budgets are developed. Indeed, the Clinton Administration will 
explain the problem as well within normal estimating error. In the parlance of 
bean counters, the financing will be considered a "negative funding wedge" that 
will be compensated by "economies and efficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar budget tactics employed during the Reagan/Weinberger years were 
soundly rejected on Capitol Hill. Ironically, leading the charge was then-House 
Budget Committee Chairman Panetta. It will be interesting to see if Congress is 
any more receptive to an old approach reinvented by new advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences in the past were that specific programs needed to be cut to 
make up the difference. But today, there is a lot less to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the mathematical food fight over how to resolve the known shortfalls, 
there are far more ominous time bombs lurking just below the budgetary surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, the Administration's frenzied agenda for change has piled 
on new responsibilities for defense, but with no new money included. The 
mightily trumpeted defense conversion initiative added upward of $10 billion of 
program commitments to find new ways to beat swords into plowshares. Defense 
budget planners have been invited to cover these costs without new funding. In 
the likely event that these government-subsidized conversion initiatives fail 
to be supported by market demand, there will be pressure to continue public 
funding.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, there has been no rush to the Treasury for the billions of dollars 
needed to pay for submarines, tanks and aircraft that, the Administration 
admits, the military doesn't need but are in the budget to "preserve the 
industrial base." 
</P>
<P>
 All these ideas to simultaneously encourage commercialization of the industry 
while also preserving it for defense production cost money. But until some 
lottery winner designates the Defense Department as the payee, other programs 
have to go to make room for these new expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has also heaped on more financial responsibility 
for destroying former Soviet nuclear and chemical weapons, covering the cost of 
United Nations peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, and paying the tab for 
economic assistance to emerging democratic nations. Add to this the cost to 
extend deployments of troops overseas to be ready in the event the President 
decides to enter the fray in Bosnia, and the financial commitments begin to 
look less in the range of estimating error and more like a budgetary implosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the biases of this Administration, the budget strategy serves a larger 
purpose: military implosion. When the known and not-so-well known estimates are 
toted up, the defense budget is better than $100 billion in the hole. To cover 
this deficit, personnel will have to be released, operational readiness 
curtailed or vital programs eliminated. The Administration's new defense 
secretary, William Perry, has inherited the management challenge equivalent of 
a 10-meter dive into a Dixie cup. Absent success in meeting this challenge, the 
President's pledge that the armed forces will be as ready and capable as when 
he took office will become a cruel fiction.

COCKBURN RIGHT ON CANYON OAKS FIASCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thanks to Alexander Cockburn for his commentary (Feb. 3) on Topanga's long 
battle against the powers of greed and insensitivity. After years of 
preliminary hearings and endless delays, the developer's project was denied in 
1991. Within two weeks the denial was reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Topanga Canyon Town Council and we at the Topanga Assn. for a Scenic 
Community initiated a meeting with the new owners to help create a plan that 
would be far less destructive. The golf course resulting from the grading of 
more than 3.5 million cubic yards of mountaintops and the headwaters of Topanga 
Creek is the most environmentally egregious aspect of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 No environmentally superior alternative was ever put forth. Then, in 1992, the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy offered $10 million to buy the land. Fair 
market value, alas, was not enough for the developer, who hopes to realize 
greater profits by developing or selling the project after it is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the developer launched an expensive public relations campaign to: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Discredit the community. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Offer handouts (called community benefits) intended to compensate for 
bulldozing 80% of the mountainous landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Woo state decision-makers (through aggressive lobbying) to reject the 
notion that the land should be declared a worthy candidate for parkland 
acquisition. Essentially, the only "emendation" by the developer of the plan 
rejected by the County Board of Supervisors in 1991 is a change in the name 
from Montevideo Country Club to Canyon Oaks Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 The area plan for the Santa Monica Mountains, approved by the Board of 
Supervisors in 1981, was created to give all of us in the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area a better environment now and in the future. The Canyon Oaks 
scheme is destructive and uncaring. It violates the standards of decency that 
this community, and all of Los Angeles, is desperately seeking to retain and 
reinforce.

years spent fighting the Montevideo/Canyon Oaks project. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Topanga real estate broker, I have testified and will testify again that 
there is no market for this kind of project in Topanga. I am sure that 
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke has reviewed the latest "market projection" 
from Canyon Oaks and recognizes it as the kind of market projection that has 
built Euro Disney.

<P>
 * I would like to commend the Wedgewood Retirement Hotel in Tarzana for its 
quick action after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there was no major structural damage to the facilities, the 
residents were transported by limos to the Hyatt Hotel in Westlake. They lived 
there for the week and were treated with kindness. Then, since the hotel was 
booked for the next week, the residents were moved to the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother is one of the residents of the Wedgewood, and I must say this is 
certainly a first-class operation.

 I couldn't believe picking up a full paper on the morning following the quake.

A HEROIC EFFORT AFTER THE QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On the morning of Jan. 17, we lost our beloved Jerry Allen Green in the 
disastrous Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the highest admiration for all the rescue workers, firefighters and 
police personnel for all their courageous efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Our family would like special recognition given to Andre van der Valk for 
heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside trained rescue workers (which he was not), he frantically dug for 
three hours through mounds of rubble, even as aftershocks rocked the Northridge 
Meadows Apartments on the collapsed first floor where Jerry lived -- 
desperately trying to find him and never giving a thought to the danger he 
faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre had never met Jerry, but this gentle man insisted that "no man should 
die alone." 
</P>
<P>
 His bravery should not go unrecognized. Our community should be aware of this 
very special man. He is an inspiration to all of us. May God bless him and his 
family, and always look after them.

SCOPE IS A THREAT TO RIVER PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Supervisors Mike Antonovich (Los Angeles) and Maggie Kildee (Ventura) have 
appointed a 25-member steering committee to develop a management and 
enhancement plan for the Santa Clarita River. 
</P>
<P>
 This long-term cooperative planning effort for the river has been jeopardized 
by the actions of one of the groups represented on the committee.The committee 
members represent the various interested parties including federal, state and 
local regulatory agencies; businesses; environmentalists; farmers; cities; 
counties, and property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 A fundamental underlying principle is that development of the plan will not be 
used to delay ongoing environmental permitting of farming and business 
activities. This was agreed upon at the committee's first meeting and discussed 
again at its Oct. 20, 1993, meeting in Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to obtain environmental permits is crucial to farmers, property 
owners and businesses to protect their properties and livelihoods from the 
erosive forces of the river. Without the appropriate permits from regulatory 
agencies, these people can lose major portions if not all of their income, 
citrus groves, crops, land and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment (SCOPE) has now 
threatened the future of this river planning. SCOPE is represented on the 
committee by Friends of the Santa Clara River, a coalition of 
environmentalists. In direct contradiction to the agreement, Lynn Plambeck, 
first vice president of SCOPE, wrote the Army Corps of Engineers on Dec. 19, 
1993, stating, "Permits should be delayed until after the River Task Force has 
had a chance to develop its Management Plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again SCOPE and Ms. Plambeck have demonstrated their disregard for human 
safety and welfare. This group's environmental objective cannot be so important 
that it justifies ignoring families' livelihoods and exposing property and 
lives to risks from the river's flooding.

SOKA 'UNIVERSITY' REALLY ISN'T ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Why does The Times insist on referring to Soka as Soka University? 
</P>
<P>
 It has neither a faculty, curriculum nor student body that would make it a 
university. Because some bureaucrats recognize it as a university for tax 
purposes does not in fact make it a university. For that matter, Los Angeles 
County does not recognize them as being a certified school, much less a 
university. As a result, Soka is required to pay property tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Your Soka article of Dec. 12 had Soka University across the page in huge 
letters. What's up?

COCKBURN RIGHT ON CANYON OAKS FIASCO; HEALTHY DEBATE ABOUT HMO PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a corollary to Roselle M. Lewis' horror story of her experiences with her 
health maintenance organization (Valley Commentary, Jan. 2), here is the other 
side of the coin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early morning hours of July 5, 1993, Mrs. Moss was suffering from 
shortness of breath. In night clothes, we rushed to the North Hollywood Medical 
Center emergency room, where she was given all possible tests and exams, under 
telephonic communication with her personal cardiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabilized, she was taken by ambulance to Valley Presbyterian Hospital, where 
she stayed for eight days. Two different specialists were called in, and we 
were warned that she might require open-heart surgery to stay alive. That was 
to be determined only after additional treatments had been tried and the 
results observed. 
</P>
<P>
 We are delighted to report that no heart surgery was needed, that she came 
home to our massive administration of TLC from members of our family and is 
today feeling quite well, albeit requiring extensive medications. 
</P>
<P>
 My point of view is stark and scary. Under the proposed Clinton "Health Care" 
plan, all persons in the United States would be subject to only managed care. 
In this instance, she would not have survived. 
</P>
<P>
 What Bill and Hillary are saying in their managed-care proposal is that they 
don't give a damn if we die, just so long as they save money. We prefer to 
choose our doctors and live. 
</P>
<P>
 EDWARD H. MOSS 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 * Roselle Lewis' article continues in a process that became popular during the 
past few decades -- doctor bashing. But the process is dated. It's based on the 
mistaken assumption that doctors alone constitute "the healing profession." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, today's healing profession is top-heavy with unseen, unknown, 
nameless professionals whom Lewis called "the parties engaged in managing my 
care." Their jobs are patient retention, market-share analysis, provider 
relations, cost containment. They create and mandate HMO policies, policies 
that denied Lewis an overnight admission to a hospital for observation, denied 
her "primary care physician" the option of referring her to an orthopedist and 
probably will also deny her the physical therapy that "later on" might be 
"recommended." 
</P>
<P>
 But does Lewis ask these new members of the health care profession to be 
patient-oriented or compassionate? Does she decry their indifference or their 
gum chewing? Of course not. She doesn't know who they are. So she targets the 
professionals she can see, name and talk to: doctors, nurses and an emergency 
room attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the HMO managers' first consideration is cost containment, yet she 
seemed to pardon them and punish the providers whose hands were tied by her own 
HMO's restrictive policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be fair. In the new era of managed care, let doctor bashing be joined, 
if not replaced, by management bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 CHERYL HUNTER COOPER,

<P>
 R.N. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * It was clear from Roselle Lewis' graphic description that care had not been 
rendered as she had expected, based on her review of brochures and 
advertisements about her senior plan with her health maintenance organization. 
It even appeared questionable, from Lewis' accounting, that proper care had 
been provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that HMO medicine often rewards providers for providing less not 
more care, spending less not more money, this has become more and more the case 
-- but it doesn't have to be. 
</P>
<P>
 What was missing from Lewis' account was any mention of how she had selected 
the providers within her HMO plan, not the emergency room to which she was 
brought after her accident, but the primary care doctors and hospital network 
she had selected upon signing up for her HMO plan years before. The performance 
results of any plan directly relate to the providers one selects within the 
plan's network. The HMO is truly just the payer of the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Some medical groups or independent practice associations focus on bonus 
incentives and profitable rewards for physicians who withhold care that 
subjectively may be described as unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other medical groups within the very same health plans may be more 
"generous" deliverers due to incentives for quality, the size of the groups 
themselves and the individual doctors within them. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumerism can assist individuals select HMO plans and providers. Before 
signing up, obtain a list of physicians and hospitals in the plan's network. 
Call them, ask questions and give them examples of what type of care you think 
should be required. 
</P>
<P>
 As our country becomes more and more directed into HMO-type plans, it is in 
everyone's interest to play an active consumer role in both the plan and the 
provider selection. That way, there will be fewer disappointments.

COMPANY'S TACTICS SPARK INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Let me see if I can get this straight. 
</P>
<P>
 First, way back in the early 1980s, the MCA corporation told the then-county 
Transportation Commission that it was not interested in negotiating a deal 
whereby a Metro Red Line subway station would be conveniently located within 
the entertainment giant's property. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason given then by MCA officials was that they did not want to be the 
drop-off point of every commuter in the Valley wishing to park and ride the 
subway into Hollywood and points east. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after sitting back for 10 years watching this "pipe dream," as it is 
termed, become a reality, MCA would love nothing better than to force the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to change the approved location to a 
locale more suitable to MCA's CityWalk attraction -- a change that would cost a 
conservatively estimated $72 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you are wondering if MCA has offered to assist to help absorb some of 
this cost, get real. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, MCA has gone as far as to attempt to hold the MTA and those of 
us in the Valley hostage if it is not given its way. The threat to withhold the 
swing vote to agree to contribute $6 million to $8 million as part of the 
planned assessment district around the station areas exhibits a complete 
disdain for the rest of the 1.5 million people in the Valley, and Los Angeles 
in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, but I am sure not least, MCA has now run off to Sacramento seeking the 
assistance of the governor's office in negotiating this one-sided request. 
</P>
<P>
 The next installment of this soap opera will no doubt involve MCA's invoking 
the tired cliches "more jobs" and "the state of the current economy." But, at 
the level of wages MCA pays their work force up on that hill, the benefits to 
the local economy pales in comparison to the costs to the public for being 
required to foot the bill for MCA's corporate benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anyone spell s-p-e-c-i-a-l i-n-t-e-r-e-s-t?

DISTRICT PASSES A STUDENT'S TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was pleasantly surprised to learn that both my alma mater, Walter Reed 
Junior High, and my current school, North Hollywood High, ranked in the top 
section of schools that administered the most tests and had the highest number 
of student passing rates. 
</P>
<P>
 As an Advanced Placement student myself, I have the deepest respect for the 
committed students that work so hard for that fateful day in April that decides 
whether one will receive credit for their torturous year of toil and trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, the Los Angeles Unified School District has done a very good 
job in encouraging Advanced Placement courses and tests, and I hope to see the 
tradition continue.

 * Once again, those of us who reside in the Valley, who play by the rules such 
as paying taxes, who are law-abiding and keep our property in reasonably good 
order, are going to get it in the shorts. Not only are we victims of the recent 
earthquake, we are also victims of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who for these many years paid for homeowners insurance plus 
earthquake protection will at best receive a chain-link fence to replace our 
nice block walls, plus a few dollars to cover interior damage. We may end up 
with enough change to buy lunch at a fast food place. The deductible on these 
earthquake policies is between 10% and 15% of the insured value. So much for 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The next problem is the Federal Emergency Management Agency. I, like many 
others, went to one of their disaster centers. After standing in line for four 
hours, I ended up with a stale doughnut and an appointment slip for a date in 
the middle of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, they didn't care whether I or any of the others had a place to stay, 
food or clothing. One of their people stated, if you are here to obtain 
vouchers for food or shelter, you're in the wrong place. Four of their 
so-called coordinators gave out four different instructions. Even the FEMA 
person passing out the appointment slips acted like he had a chip on his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 And President Clinton during the so-called town meeting acted bored and almost 
went to sleep.

HEBERT FAILS TO STOP BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a day Guy Hebert will remember as "bittersweet." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday morning, Hebert became the No. 1 goalie when his buddy Ron Tugnutt was 
traded to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost a partner," Hebert told Tugnutt, giving him a playful hug as they 
walked through a dank hall in St. Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night, Hebert started for the Mighty Ducks in a 4-1 loss to the St. 
Louis Blues, the team he was a backup on for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Another old buddy, Blue goalie Curtis Joseph, showed the form that rendered 
Hebert a backup when he was here. He made 42 saves and held the Ducks to a goal 
by Terry Yake at 14:39 of the second period, with the Blues leading, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake's goal, his 19th, came when he left a drop pass for Bob Corkum, cut to 
the slot and scored off Corkum's pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback was stopped cold when the Blues' Vitali Prokhorov scored on the 
next shift (14:58). 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Miller got the Blues off to a good start when he scored his 20th goal of 
the season at 4:03 of the first after Hebert tried to poke check the puck away 
with Miller closing in on a breakaway chance. The puck came back onto Miller's 
stick as he skated wide, though, and he put it in the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guy half-fanned on a clearing attempt and the guy scores from a 
near-impossible angle," Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Janney added a goal at 7:02 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "There they pick up a puck off a dump-in and we blew our coverage there," 
Wilson said. "There again, Guy makes a good play and he pokes the puck off the 
guy's skate into the net. We weren't getting a lot of breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Shanahan's 36th goal closed out the Blues' scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's usually the story for the Blues," Wilson said. "It's Curtis Joseph and 
they've got a couple of guys up front who usually finish off the plays, whether 
it's Brett Hull, Craig Janney, Brendan Shanahan. One of those guys will kill 
you, and Kevin Miller can, too. And then they rely on Cujo to make all the big 
stops and tonight he was up to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert's day was filled with ambivalent feelings about the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured we made it through the season this far, I didn't think either one 
of us thought anything was going to really change the rest of the year," he 
said. "We've become pretty good friends over the last several months and it's 
tough to see him go because I think we both helped each other out a lot. 
(Still) this is something I've worked for for a long time, and it's a big vote 
of confidence by the organization and I really feel it could have gone either 
way. I mean, we were pretty close in everything, all the stats and all that. 
I'm happy being here and happy to get the chance to play a lot of games now." 
Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are expected to acquire goaltender John Tanner today from Quebec for 
a 1995 fourth-round draft pick. Tanner, 23, was with Cornwall of the American 
Hockey League, and will be assigned to San Diego, replacing Mikhail Shtalenkov, 
who replaced Ron Tugnutt on the Duck roster. . . . Defenseman Alexei Kasatonov 
was unable to wear a shoe on his swollen right foot after being hit with a shot 
and will undergo X-rays today. . . . Center Anatoli Semenov was scratched 
because of lingering soreness in his formerly dislocated left elbow.

PIGSKIN CLASSIC EYES NEBRASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nebraska has been invited to play in the Aug. 29 Disney Pigskin Classic at 
Anaheim Stadium, Don Andersen, the executive director of the Orange County 
Sports Assn., said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska, expected to be ranked in the top five of many preseason polls, has 
yet to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're interested, but we haven't firmed anything up at this point," 
Andersen said. "We hope to in the next couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no word on an opponent for the Cornhuskers, but Wisconsin is believed 
to be under consideration.

3 SANTA ANA SCHOOLS STIR PRAISE, CONTROVERSY; EDUCATION: SOME HAIL THE 
'FUNDAMENTAL' PROGRAM FOR ITS DRESS CODE, DISCIPLINE, ACADEMICS; OTHERS CALL IT 
ELITIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Perew and his children have done their share of shopping for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The eldest began kindergarten near the family home in Lake Forest, but Perew 
was "very much unsatisfied." Later, his two girls spent a year in Placentia 
classrooms, which Perew recalls as "an absolute disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to settle in his search for top-notch education, Perew considered 
private schools, even thought about teaching his kids at home. Finally, defying 
all stereotypes, he left suburban south Orange County and moved to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perew's is not just any Santa Ana school. His three children attend John 
Muir, one of the city's magnet "fundamental" schools, where test scores are far 
above the district average and competition for classroom space is so keen that 
parents camp overnight to register for kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the program's popularity and success, the district decided last 
week to open a fourth fundamental school, but some in the community are 
struggling to define the program and make access to it more fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two decades ago, the fundamental schools were founded in Orange 
County's largest school district as English-only bastions of parental control, 
where the three R's reigned supreme and dress codes and discipline were serious 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the two elementary and one intermediate school retain rigid dress codes 
and discipline: Girls can't wear makeup, boys' can't have hair that reaches 
below collars or have beards or mustaches, and shorts are allowed only on 
hottest days. Academics and patriotism are stressed, and homework is assigned 
four nights a week -- even for kindergartners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just higher expectations," said Raylene Salcido, 14, who completed 
Greenville Fundamental and now is student body president at MacArthur 
Fundamental Intermediate School. "Since the standards are higher, the students 
try harder." 
</P>
<P>
 But with districtwide curriculum requirements and teachers swapping styles and 
strategies, the difference between neighborhood and fundamental schools has 
blurred. Critics say the only real difference lies in the student populations, 
and accuse the magnet schools of serving "yuppie bigots" in an elitist system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're magnet schools for Anglos, and it's got to be undone," said Nativo 
Lopez of the immigrant-rights group, Hermandad Nacional. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not have two systems in our district. We should not have an 
apartheid-type system in our district," said Lopez, the father of a Santa Ana 
third-grader. "Separate but equal has never been equal. . . . In Santa Ana, 
we're clustering children of the same racial group and of the same income 
brackets. . . . It's racial education." 
</P>
<P>
 Such charges date back to the start of Santa Ana's fundamental movement in 
1974, when many considered the proposal a solution to the massive "white 
flight" from the district, where Latino immigrants had begun to dominate and 
bilingual education was becoming the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most schools in Orange County, the fundamental schools now have mostly 
minority students, but they continue to draw disproportionate numbers of the 
city's white, middle-class families, creating a kind of district within a 
district that looks very different from Santa Ana Unified as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the demographics: 
</P>
<P>
 * The district has 36 elementary and intermediate schools, but 42% of the 
white students attend the three fundamental schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * At neighborhood schools, 83% of the students qualify for free or 
reduced-price lunches because they come from poor families. Among students at 
fundamental schools, only 29% qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other Santa Ana schools serve populations where 77% of the students have 
limited English proficiency; fundamental schools have only 14% in that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
 * While many Santa Ana schools are overcrowded, the fundamental schools have 
enrollment caps and long waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of race or income, all fundamental students have one thing in 
common: Their parents went out of their way to get them there and have signed 
contracts pledging their success. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have parents committing to standing in line and registering for the 
school, committing to the school, you have an advantage," said MacArthur 
Principal Jane Russo. "Any time parents and teachers and students come together 
committed to a set of goals, you're going to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joan Wilkinson, a school board member from 1979 to 1987, said fundamental 
schools "always seemed to have some special privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a child isn't behaving, OK, goodby. We don't correct the behavior, we just 
send them to another school," she complained. "To me, it's uneven. It's not 
equitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the fundamental schools say the demographic differences are 
accidental. Enrollment is first come, first served, with the only admissions 
requirement being agreement to follow the rules and support the schools' 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who go to fundamental school are the people who are motivated to 
take advantage," said Jim Richards, a former Santa Ana school board member who 
was among the original advocates of fundamental schools. "That's the concept 
that built our country, that's capitalism: You get to benefit more for your 
extra effort than everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 But getting students to the fundamental schools is not so simple. 
</P>
<P>
 The district does not provide transportation, and the schools are in Santa 
Ana's safest neighborhoods near the edges of the school district. This keeps 
them relatively free from the problems of gangs, graffiti and drug deals that 
plague many of the district's other campuses, but it also makes them difficult 
to get to for poor families living in the central-city areas. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several years, parents have camped outside these schools for more 
than a day so they would be at the head of the line to register their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the competition even stiffer, at MacArthur graduates of fundamental 
elementary schools and siblings of current students get first priority for 
openings at the intermediate school. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents, particularly new immigrants, may never even learn that the 
magnet schools exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has access, but not everybody has equal access," Supt. Rudy 
Castruita acknowledged. "We need to arm all our parents, whether they be 
immigrant parents, whether they be parents in the inner city, to access all the 
education in the system." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Castruita and a majority of the school board fought for the 
second intermediate fundamental school, which is scheduled to open in 1996 and 
will be on the north side of town (MacArthur is near the city's southern edge). 
But even that school is far from the city center, and it is unclear whether its 
opening will change the demographics of the fundamental system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wrong for us to put these schools way at the north and south 
ends of town," said school board member Rosemarie Avila, who has two children 
at Greenville and is an ardent backer of fundamental education. "People are 
always bragging that we have schools of choice. But how can you say you have 
equal access if you don't tell anybody these schools exist?" 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new intermediate school, some parents and educators hope 
the district will create a fundamental high school. Right now, the district is 
rapidly losing fundamental students who leave town rather than join the 
neighborhood high school system. Nearly a quarter of MacArthur's 1993 graduates 
are no longer in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Katherine Farless' three children attended Santa Ana elementary 
schools and MacArthur, but will graduate from Fountain Valley High. Farless was 
a happy customer during her years in Santa Ana Unified, but said she was afraid 
to send her children to the district's high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way I was going to have them walk anywhere in that neighborhood, 
for safety reasons," Farless said of Valley High, the school closest to her 
home. "If there was a fundamental high school . . . I might have looked into 
that more." Santa Ana high schools, she said, "just didn't offer a real draw." 
</P>
<P>
 These and other critical issues have surfaced in recent months as the school 
board debated the new intermediate school, approving it Wednesday by a 3-2 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no one seems entirely sure what fundamental education means. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, fundamental schools rejected technology, scoffed at team teaching 
and cooperative learning, refused special state or federal grants, had neither 
special education nor advanced classes and did not provide native-language 
assistance for students who did not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, computers and television are a staple of the classroom, where students 
sometimes learn in rows and sometimes in groups. All three schools accept state 
money and have special education students, and the intermediate school has an 
honors track. Instruction remains in English, but there are teacher aides to 
help those struggling with the language. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire district uses the same curriculum and has the same standards for 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take what works and what's best at schools and we try to incorporate them 
throughout our district," Castruita explained. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, all intermediate schools now ask students to use three-ring 
binders, an idea that started at MacArthur. Homework charts, too, started in 
the fundamental schools and are now standard fare, along with specific lessons 
designed to improve study habits. Next year, several neighborhood schools will 
even experiment with parental contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the fundamental schools have grown away from their "back-to-basics" 
roots, becoming a potpourri of progressive and traditional teaching methods. 
</P>
<P>
 At Muir one day last week, a teacher in one class was writing in a perfect 
hand on a neatly lined chalkboard while her four-grade students sat in rows and 
raised hands before speaking. However, in another class children were scattered 
around the room. Some even sat on the floor or hovered in the corner with a 
video camera as they practiced speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would see a lot of the same practices in our classrooms as you would in 
other classrooms," admitted Greenville Fundamental Principal Melanie Champion. 
"The school has evolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents like former Lake Forest resident Perew appreciate their opportunity to 
participate in that process. 
</P>
<P>
 "For our family, it really is a commitment that we are going to work with our 
children and with the school to make this a meaningful and productive 
educational environment," he explained. "That doesn't mean that we're going to 
sit at home and just send them off to school with a nice lunch and pat them on 
the head when they get home. It means that we get involved with what's going on 
there at the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Any discussion of fundamental education eventually comes back to parental 
involvement. Parents who care enough to shop for the best schools generally 
have children who are more ready to learn, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a traditional school you have a lot more kids who have given up on the 
system and who are difficult. . . . All we're doing is isolating the kids who 
have the potential to go on," said Bill Sturgeon, a veteran history teacher who 
has been at MacArthur since it opened in 1982. "The problem is greater than 
fundamental schools. The problem is the kids who have given up on the system. 
Maybe we need to revamp the whole system." District Within a District 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic composition at Santa Ana's three fundamental schools, Greenville and 
Muir elementary and MacArthur Intermediate, differs greatly from the 34 other 
elementary and middle schools in the district. The fundamental schools also 
have smaller percentages of students with limited English language skills and 
those entitled to free or reduced charge lunches: 03,24,13,17 Fundamental 
Non-Fundamental Ethnicity Latino 58% 90% White 28% 3% Asian 8% 6% Black 5% 1% 
All others 1% - Total enrollment 2,792 34,417 Limited English skills 14% 77% 
Free/reduced lunch 29% 83% All others less than 1% 
</P>

 Higher Scores 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamental school students also far outscore their district peers in 
standardized tests. The Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills is given annually 
and scored by percentile rankings. Here are results of the 1992-93 exams for 
the fundamental schools compared to the district's average: 04,12,09,10,06

speak another language typically do not take the tests for two or three years 
after they begin school.

<P>
 According to the Santa Ana Unified School District dress code, forbidden 
school wear includes, among other things, cutoff shorts, items with 
professional or collegiate sports affiliations and those with references to 
alcohol, drugs, bigotry or profanity. The city's fundamental schools have 
stricter ideas about appearance. Guidelines include: 
</P>
<P>
 CLOTHING 
</P>
<P>
 * Hemlines: Must be no more than three inches above the knees, and no 
undergarments may show. No skirts or dresses with attached shorts or pants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shirts and blouses: Must be tucked in unless they are "specifically styled 
to be worn outside." Waist-length blouses must be worn with a shirt underneath 
so the stomach does not show when arms are raised.

DOWNPOUR BRINGS MUD TO MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER and JOHN L. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An intense winter downpour -- the third major storm to hit the region in two 
weeks -- brought heavy snowfalls to local mountains and left Malibu residents 
once again digging out of mud and debris that surged down rain-soaked 
hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful cloudbursts Sunday trapped some beachfront residents in their 
homes and cars, forced a brief closing of Interstate 5 at the Grapevine and set 
loose mudslides that shut down a portion of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also closed the flood-prone Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area to motorists 
for about eight hours as waters behind Sepulveda Dam rose to near-overflow 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's showers, which dropped up to three inches of rain along the coast and 
as much as a foot of snow in the mountains, are expected to taper off early 
today, forecasters say, leaving the city with clear skies to calculate the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain-slick freeways and roadways caused major traffic tie-ups and 
contributed to numerous accidents, including three fatalities in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified man was killed Sunday morning when his car skidded out of 
control on the westbound Artesia Freeway near Lakewood Boulevard. The man, who 
was not wearing a seat belt, died when he was thrown from his car. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, two people died when they lost control of their van on the 
rain-slick Artesia Freeway. The van was hit by a big-rig truck on the freeway 
near Yorba Linda, a California Highway Patrol officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain was also blamed for two power outages Sunday that left more than 
1,600 Southern California Edison customers in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica 
without electricity for two hours, an Edison spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 As snow fell over the Grapevine area, the California Highway Patrol closed 
Interstate 5 from Lake Hughes Road in Castaic to Lavalle Road in Kern County 
from 1:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Also as a precaution, Los Angeles police closed off roads into the Sepulveda 
Dam Recreation Area, where sudden floodwaters trapped a number of motorists two 
years ago. The roads were shut down from about 4 a.m. until noon. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, rescue workers raced Sunday to evacuate residents whose homes were 
threatened by the movement of water, mud and rocks toward the sea. Garages and 
front doors of more than 50 homes along PCH were inundated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles county lifeguards and sheriff's deputies used ropes to rescue 
Christa Roberts and her two sons, ages 9 and 10, from their home on Carbon 
Canyon Road, where a river of water about 4 feet deep and 15 feet wide swept 
down the canyon, blocking their escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasier Filippin, a Big Rock resident who was on his way to the ski slopes, 
refused to leave his Mercedes when it became mired in the mud near the 
intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Big Rock Drive. Filippin sat in the 
vehicle for nearly an hour and a half as the fast-moving water crept halfway up 
the silver car. 
</P>
<P>
 Filippin was finally plucked to safety by a lifeguard who was lowered to the 
vehicle by the scoop of a Caltrans caterpillar.  
</P>
<P>
 Standing under an umbrella on a stack of sandbags across from his car, 
Filippin said, "I'm very upset. Honest to God, I don't want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Caltrans skip loaders worked at scooping up the muck, filling dump 
trucks that unloaded the ooze over the side of the highway and down to the 
ocean at Las Flores Canyon Road and Big Rock Drive. Officials closed the 
highway between Topanga Canyon Road and Cross Creek Road. 
</P>
<P>
 At Las Flores Canyon Road and Pacific Coast Highway, an enormous mud flow 
filled the parking lot and part of the interior of the Charley Brown's Sea Lion 
restaurant, and flowed into the ground floor of a nearby five-unit, two-story 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we had it made because we didn't get it in the other disasters, 
but it just came through our bedroom, broke the wall open . . . " said a woman 
who lived in a ground-floor apartment with her husband and asked not to be 
named. "We couldn't get the door open, but we finally got out. Everything is 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of residents whose homes were hit in the Feb. 7 storm, which damaged 
at least 25 homes, found their homes inundated again by Sunday's rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "A neighbor called at about 2 a.m. and told me to get ready to be evacuated," 
said Sid Jacobson, who had just finished putting his garage door back up from 
damage caused by the last storm. "Then I heard a river that sounded like 
Niagara Falls come through. Then I went back to sleep. What the hell else am I 
going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Jacobson's sandbag preparations, a 20-by-30-foot section of asphalt 
pavement between the highway and his front door collapsed and dropped about 15 
feet to the sand below. Jacobson surmised it gave way from the weight of the 
mud, rock and water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New areas of Malibu showed vulnerability to Sunday's rain, alarming a number 
of residents along PCH just above Tuna Canyon Road, whose homes for the first 
time filled with mud. "I've been here 22 years and this mountain has never come 
down," said Peppi Kelman, pointing to the hillside across from her muddy home. 
"This is the problem," she said, pointing to Pena Creek, which runs into a 
cement drainage ditch on the mountainside above Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday morning, rain turned the creek into a rapidly moving river.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; REUNION SOOTHES QUAKE MEMORIES; RECOVERY: 
NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS SURVIVORS AND THEIR RESCUERS TAKE AN EVENING TO GET TO KNOW 
EACH OTHER. RECOUNTING THE EXPERIENCE BRINGS SOLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They met for the first time Jan. 17 as strangers thrown together by the most 
cataclysmic event of their lives -- the collapse of the Northridge Meadows 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 They met again Saturday night, as heroes and survivors curious about one 
another and how they'd fared since the days of the Northridge quake.  
</P>
<P>
 The three hours of laughter and tears over linguine and spinach salad helped 
speed a few of the rescuers and two of the rescued along the road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly five weeks after the quake, former roommates Jerry Prezioso and Steve 
Langdon came to dinner at a fire station in Chatsworth, temporary quarters of 
the Los Angeles city firefighters who dug them out of the ruins of Apartment 
106. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no fanfare or plaques or proclamations -- just a group of men 
sitting around a firehouse swapping war stories about five hours they spent in 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time firefighter Jack Lewis saw Prezioso was midmorning on Jan. 17 
-- as an anonymous pair of legs protruding from beneath a collapsed wall. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday, shared experience lent the men instant familiarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry, how's the tummy?" Lewis asked. And, Prezioso, 67, pulled up his shirt 
and displayed the purplish scars that still dot his chest and stomach like 
stigmata, reminders of the nails that dug into him when the wall of his bedroom 
collapsed upon him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't aware of the nails until you guys started pulling me out," Prezioso 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you guys look great," exclaimed another firefighter, Lee Lewis. He 
greeted Langdon with: "Steve, your face looks a lot fuller without a wall on 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 "He's the guy who was standing on your bed," Capt. Bob Fickett told Prezioso. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love your boots!" Prezioso quipped. "As far as I'm concerned, when I saw 
those boots on my bed, I didn't care whether they were dirty or not." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went. They swapped details, piecing together a story about what 
happened to them all on the morning of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso, who spent 25 years in show business traveling the country as a 
member of the Happy Jesters, a comedy singing trio, also regaled the 
firefighters with stories told in the frank and colorful manner of a native New 
Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
 He wiped away a tear or two as he thought about treasured photographs -- one 
taken with Jimmy Durante, another with Red Skelton -- lost in the ruins of his 
former home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one would take credit for the idea, Fickett said the firefighters 
had wanted to meet the two roommates since the earthquake. The captain said his 
crew had never met anyone they'd rescued, much less had them to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest was mutual. Langdon, 45, flew in from Reno for the occasion. "I 
just wanted to come and see everybody," he said. "I'm just grateful they were 
there. They seem like a nice bunch of guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the men they rescued, the firefighters have been displaced by the quake. 
Their own station, No. 70, just four blocks from Northridge Meadows, has been 
red-tagged. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two who were rescued face physical problems as well. Prezioso, his 
knees swollen and scarred, needs crutches to get around. Langdon still can't 
laugh, sneeze or cough without painful reminders of the five ribs and 
collarbone broken under the weight of a three-story apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their scars are less visible, the firefighters also carry painful 
memories of a day when they were jolted out of bed, then saw too many broken 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such an emotional thing, getting thrown out of quarters and going 
instantly to work. Some guys have had problems with it," Fickett said. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews last week, psychologists said that while such post-trauma 
meetings are rare, more survivors are dealing with the aftermath by seeking out 
others who shared the experience. "Anybody who goes through something like this 
is going to experience a lot of emotional pain," said Matt Ryan, a clinical 
psychologist who treats trauma victims at the Barrington Psychiatric Center in 
West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are looking for ways, even if they aren't quite aware of it, to 
overcome the images in their minds. We're all going through post-traumatic 
stress syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that survivors of traumatic experiences often feel isolated and 
misunderstood. Sometimes they need to be with other survivors -- the only 
people they feel can understand them. 
</P>
<P>
 At Saturday night's firehouse dinner, Langdon told Prezioso, "Let's just say 
that if you were gone, nobody would have heard me yelling, because I was 
yelling into the mattress."  
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso responded, "You don't know the heartwarming phone call I got from 
your mother. She says to me, 'Thank you for keeping my son alive.' " He paused 
and wiped his eyes. "That's what God kept me alive for, I guess -- to make 
other people feel just a little bit better. What did I do, that God keeps 
throwing me back?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist and a member of 
the state disaster team, "The rescuers are going through a traumatic situation, 
too. Some of their rescues weren't successful, and that hurts." He said the 
reunion helps the firefighters as well, allowing them to celebrate their 
success.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is their way of coping with the earthquake. It will be interesting to 
see whether there is any contact beyond, say, a brief period of time," 
Butterworth said. "Events like this do become defining moments." 
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso vowed to return in mid-March to cook Italian sauce for the firemen. 
"What about it pal, a little variety?" he challenged firefighter Mike Henry, 
the cook for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But pain lay just beneath the surface, and sometimes it bubbled up, unbidden, 
from beneath the breezy banter and salty stories.  
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso broke down, allowing that he sometimes has bad moments, then cursed 
and apologized. The firefighters quickly told him he was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not the only one who gets anxious," said firefighter Bill Mueller. 
"Sometimes I sit next to a wall and look at it," he said, referring to 
apprehension about frequent aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Lewis told Prezioso that the quake has taken its toll on him, too. "I 
remember on my last shift saying to myself, 'This is the first time I've felt 
comfortable about these earthquakes. That was at 1 o'clock. At 1:13, there was 
another one." 
</P>
<P>
 For the survivors, dealing with the aftershocks is a constant reminder of what 
they endured. But never far from their minds is the simple but sobering fact 
that they are here remembering -- and 16 others are not.

FIRE EVACUEES HOME AFTER TOXIC SCARE; BURBANK: INDUSTRIAL BLAZE POSED A DILEMMA 
BECAUSE LIQUID CYANIDE WAS STORED AT SITE. OFFICIALS DECIDED TO LET IT BURN 
ITSELF OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Residents evacuated overnight from the neighborhood near Chestnut and Mariposa 
streets were allowed back into their homes Sunday morning after firefighters 
extinguished a blaze that burned an industrial plating company that housed 
potentially deadly liquid cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities evacuated nine square blocks around the Alert Plating Co. -- 
located at 730 N. Mariposa St. -- which caught fire about 6:30 p.m. Saturday, 
said Burbank Fire Marshal Darryl Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people were taken to Walt Disney Elementary School to spend the 
night. A police officer was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center for smoke 
inhalation and promptly released, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 firefighters were called to the fire, which posed a strategic dilemma 
because hundreds of gallons of toxic chemicals were stored at the building, 
Forbes said. Fire officials feared that sending streams of water into the 
building might inadvertently create a dangerous mix of chemical gases. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes said firefighters also did not want to send gallons of dangerous 
chemicals into storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, "we decided to confine the fire to the building. We basically let 
the building burn," Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was contained by 7 p.m. Saturday, but did not burn out until 10:30 
a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were allowed back into their homes at 11 a.m. Sunday, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite firefighters' measures, small traces of cyanide were detected in the 
air and the water runoff surrounding the building, Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hazardous-materials disposal company pumped the tainted water out Sunday. 
The company also pumped the cyanide out of the building early Sunday morning, 
discovering that 450 gallons of acids had mixed with the cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a deadly mixture," Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage caused by the fire is estimated at $1.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The origin of the fire was unknown Sunday. Burbank fire officials were 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's owner could not be reached for comment Sunday.

YOUTH SHOT IN FACE BY ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old man showing off a .22-caliber rifle to a group of friends Sunday 
accidentally shot a 17-year-old boy in the face, critically injuring him, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified victim, a resident of West Hills, was taken to Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, where he underwent a CAT scan to determine if the 
bullet had penetrated his brain, said Lt. Jeff Hulet of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Russel Rayburn was booked on suspicion of possession of a firearm with an 
obliterated serial number, Hulet said. Possession of such a weapon is a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Rayburn was at his parents' house in the 6700 block of Royar Avenue showing 
the gun to about half a dozen friends when the accident occurred about 2:50 
p.m., Hulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police Rayburn was "horsing around with the rifle," pointing it 
at different people in the room before the accident, Hulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hulet said the injured boy was shot from a distance of 10 to 12 feet, adding: 
"He's very lucky to be alive."

RETRIAL TO BEGIN IN LOCKHEED WORKERS' LAWSUIT AGAINST CHEMICAL FIRMS; COURTS: 
EMPLOYEES ON STEALTH FIGHTER PROJECT SAY THEY WERE NOT ADEQUATELY WARNED OF 
POTENTIAL DANGERS FROM EXPOSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Stealth fighter was a terror to the Iraqis in the Gulf War, but since the 
days when it was the Pentagon's biggest secret it has been shadowed by a 
non-military question: Did working on its high-tech body ruin workers' health? 
</P>
<P>
 Another round in the legal battle over that question begins this week when 
attorneys representing more than 600 former Lockheed Corp. workers and the 
nearly two dozen chemical companies they are suing return to court in the 
retrial of a chemical-exposure lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for both sides spent last week in Los Angeles Superior Court 
selecting a jury. Opening arguments are scheduled to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge declared a mistrial in the first round last April after jurors failed 
to reach a verdict following an eight-month trial, which included the longest 
jury deliberations in a civil case in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers are seeking unspecified damages from the companies that allegedly 
supplied chemicals to make the Stealth fighter and other military aircraft at 
the Lockheed facility in Burbank during the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers originally sued Lockheed as well, but after the company settled 
for $33 million, the workers proceeded to trial against the chemical companies 
in August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial involved 14 workers, chosen as "pilot" plaintiffs from a group of 
624 current and former Lockheed employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers filed damage claims alleging that the chemical companies failed to 
provide adequate warnings about the dangers of their products, causing them to 
suffer injuries ranging from skin rashes to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both sides hoped that verdicts in the first case would lead to 
settlements of the other claims, holding future trials to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 weeks of tense deliberations in the extremely complex case, however, 
jurors failed to reach a verdict, frustrating attorneys on both sides and 
Superior Court Judge Melvin B. Grover, who presided over the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-pronged defense for the upcoming case, lawyers for the chemical firms 
said last week there is no proof the workers were injured by chemical exposure. 
In any case, they say, the companies supplied Lockheed officials with adequate 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe every single defendant and certainly my clients . . . always 
provided adequate warning labels," said Nicholas W. Hornberger, an attorney 
representing five of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornberger said his clients maintain that Lockheed failed to pass the warnings 
on to their employees. He noted that workers testified during the first trial 
that they never saw the material safety data sheets, which the companies supply 
to their customers advising them on the risks of their products and providing 
instructions on their use. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas V. Girardi, lead attorney representing the workers, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot workers who were plaintiffs in the first trial will be involved in 
the upcoming trial, a defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the first trial, attorneys for the workers must establish that their 
clients were injured by chemical exposure, that the chemical companies provided 
inadequate warnings for their products and their failure to warn of the risks 
caused or contributed to the workers' injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 To simplify matters, Superior Court Judge Richard C. Hubbell, who will hear 
the upcoming case, split the second trial into two phases to limit the number 
of issues the jury will have to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first phase, jurors will determine which chemicals were at the 
Lockheed facility in Burbank and whether warnings supplied by the chemical 
companies in the form of labels and material safety data sheets were adequate, 
said Mark E. Fingerman, an attorney representing the Henkel Corp. If the jury 
finds the warnings were inadequate, then it must determine whether any of the 
companies acted with fraud, oppression or malice in supplying the warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the trial proceed to the second phase, attorneys for the workers must 
establish that their clients were injured, that the injuries resulted from 
chemical exposure and that inadequate warnings caused the exposure, Fingerman 
said. The jury also will determine any general and punitive damages during the 
second phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurence F. Janssen, an attorney for some of the plaintiffs, including Exxon, 
Shell, Unocal and Dupont, said he expects the first phase of the trial to last 
until mid-April and the second phase, if needed, to take another four to six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingerman, attorney for Henkel Corp., which produced an anti-corrosive 
chemical used in treating aircraft components, said there is no evidence that 
any of the 14 pilot plaintiffs were injured as a result of their work at 
Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical suppliers would not be liable for such injuries anyway, according to 
Fingerman, who said that Lockheed had the responsibility and know-how to 
protect its workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lockheed is one of the most sophisticated users of chemicals in the world," 
he said.

LATINO CLUB LEADER QUITS IN BIAS DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of a Latino student group at Mt. San Antonio College resigned 
after a white student filed a grievance against the club, accusing it of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy erupted after Nicole Lemottee approached Valentin Pingarron, 
then president of Movimiento Estudantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA), during club 
sign-up day on Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemottee, an 18-year-old marine biology major, said she had been interested in 
joining the club because she is engaged to a Mexican American man. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemottee said, however, she had misgivings about speakers sponsored by the 
student group who she felt were biased against whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemottee said that when she said so to Pingarron, he told her she would not be 
welcome in the group because she was white and couldn't understand the group's 
background and issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemottee filed a grievance against the club with the school's student 
association on Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not welcome in their club and that's reverse discrimination," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pingarron, a second-year journalism major, contended that Lemottee expressed 
views that ran contrary to the group's philosophy of helping the Latino 
community and demanded explanations for the club's activities.  
</P>
<P>
 Pingarron said he told Lemottee he would not welcome her membership after she 
expressed support for ideas such as increasing militarization of the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grievance spurred a debate within the club over its membership 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 According to acting President Anita Sibayan, Pingarron resigned after the club 
refused to support his position that political views should be a test of 
membership and that whites should not be allowed to join. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not a racist or separatist group," Sibayan said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; POST-QUAKE TRAFFIC ROUTES TAKE A BEATING; 
TRANSPORTATION: ROADS THAT WITHSTOOD THE SHAKING ARE NOW BEING BATTERED BY 
CARAVANS OF DIVERTED COMMUTERS AND RAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Surface streets that withstood the initial battering of the Northridge 
earthquake are now taking a daily pounding from overflowing traffic diverted 
from crumbled freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Long lines of cars and trucks are traveling on roads unprepared to handle such 
weight and volume, according to Santa Clarita city officials and traffic 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already seen the damage along Lyons Avenue when traffic is diverted off 
of I-5," said Gail Foy, the city's public information officer, noting one of 
several streets showing the strain of post-quake traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has tallied $6.8 million in damages to its roads so far, and 
officials expect the figure to climb as more complete repair estimates come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the damages are the recent rains that have soaked city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rains don't help," Foy said. "The trucks come by and weaken the street, 
then the rains come and weaken them even more." 
</P>
<P>
 The following Santa Clarita thoroughfares have borne the brunt of the traffic 
rerouted since the Northridge earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sierra Highway. When debris from the earthquake still blocked the Golden 
State Freeway, this street parallel to the Antelope Valley Freeway was the only 
southern route for commuters from the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. All 
four lanes were temporarily designated for southbound travel in the mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic now runs in both directions again, but an additional lane has been 
striped to improve the commute. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Fernando Road. As one of the two primary roads that feed onto Sierra 
Highway and a designated truck route, this was the first street in the center 
of the city to be packed with cars following the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A left-hand turn lane is to be installed this week for northbound traffic 
turning onto Lyons Avenue that should help evening driving, said Bahman Janka, 
a city traffic engineer.  
</P>
<P>
 * Soledad Canyon Road/Valencia Boulevard. Santa Clarita's only major east-west 
thoroughfare, it often crawls bumper-to-bumper during peak times, but blockage 
of the Golden State and Antelope Valley interchange has sent hundreds more 
drivers cutting through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City engineers hope to better synchronize traffic signals along the 
thoroughfare to ease congestion along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be taking a look at the whole signal system along Soledad 
Canyon Road to see what we can do," Janka said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lyons Avenue. Because it is a connection to the jammed San Fernando Road and 
with the parallel Soledad Canyon Road packed to the north, many drivers are 
trying to cut across this east-west road. Trucks rarely crossed this road 
before the quake but now travel it frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have done with most expenses incurred as Santa Clarita deals with 
quake damage, city officials plan to ask the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency to reimburse repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities are eligible to apply for federal funds for secondary damage to streets 
from the Jan. 17 earthquake, according to Harry Sherwood, who reviews street 
and public works claims for FEMA. 
</P>

 "It could be said this damage is directly the result of the earthquake," 
Sherwood said. "The freeway is down, and that traffic definitely has to go 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Santa Clarita is reimbursed for repairs, that doesn't make the commute 
any shorter or the roads any smoother in the meantime. Overflow traffic is 
expected to continue clogging surface streets for the months it takes to repair 
damage to the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be impacted by that for a very long time," Janka said.

DUCKS TRADE TUGNUTT TO MONTREAL FOR LEBEAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks parted with half of what once was their Nos. 1 and 1-A 
goaltending tandem Sunday, trading Ron Tugnutt to the Montreal Canadiens for 
Stephan Lebeau, a skilled young center who had 31 goals and 80 points for the 
Stanley Cup champions last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks said goodby to the player who was in goal for the first victory in 
franchise history, but at practice today in Buffalo they will greet a player 
who should give them an immediate offensive boost -- particularly on a power 
play that ranks 23rd in the NHL and has scored on only five of its last 60 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hate to see a guy like Tugger go, he's done so well for us and been 
everything we've asked for and an important part of our first year," Coach Ron 
Wilson said. "(But) we felt our organization is very deep in goal, that's our 
strongest asset, and we can afford to give up Ron Tugnutt to bolster our 
offense. We got someone in Stephan Lebeau we feel is going to enable us to 
score more goals." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal -- the Ducks' first since the season began -- formally stamped Guy 
Hebert as the Ducks' No. 1 goalie. Mikhail Shtalenkov was called up from San 
Diego to be the backup. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade also should put the team in a stronger position to contend with the 
San Jose Sharks and the Kings for the final Western Conference playoff spot. 
But General Manager Jack Ferreira, who orchestrated the deal from the Olympics 
in Norway, said it is more a long-term move than a playoff deal. "That's in the 
back of your mind because we are in the hunt," Ferreira said. "But we also knew 
we needed to upgrade our power play and needed a finisher and another playmaker 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau, who turns 26 on Feb. 28, was the Canadiens' fourth-leading scorer last 
season, but a severely sprained ankle this season has limited him to 34 games, 
and he has nine goals and seven assists. However, he has played in the 
Canadiens' last two games after missing the previous five weeks with the 
injury, and Wilson says he now is 100% healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt was at the morning skate Sunday when Wilson told him of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt, who fell behind Hebert during a shaky stretch when he was preoccupied 
by the impending birth of his first child, was less elated than one might 
think. 
</P>
<P>
 He has gone from a new team to a contender, but now he is the backup to 
Patrick Roy, perhaps the best goalie in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit disappointed," he said. "I think that things were going very 
well here. I was enjoying California and more than anything I was enjoying the 
players here. It was fun being a part of a new franchise that has a chance to 
make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about the chance of winning the Stanley Cup, it's a great hockey 
team. But I was also very excited to come to Anaheim because I was going to get 
a chance to play. I understand already that I won't be getting much ice time, 
so that's going to be very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say (the decision to trade me) is right or wrong, time will 
tell, but I really think Guy and I together were a good combination. For their 
sake here, I hope he can handle the workload for the rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the Ducks said their goodbys to Tugnutt, the players who once 
played with Lebeau in Montreal spoke of him enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephan Lebeau is a very gifted player, he's got great hands and on special 
teams he's phenomenal," said former Canadien Todd Ewen. "I think he'll really 
improve our power play for one and he's got a good work ethic so he'll fit 
right in . . . He's going to really help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau, a Quebec native, has played his entire professional career in the 
Montreal organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the feeling that I was going to be traded and I was very happy it was 
to Anaheim," Lebeau said. "It's a new team and for me I think I'm going to have 
a chance to play more and play the style of hockey I can play . . . They have a 
good team and a chance to make the playoffs. No doubt, I look forward to trying 
to help them make it."

MIKE DOWNEY: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; THEY HITCH A RIDE ON DREAMS AND 
A PRAYER

 Nathan (Chip) Minton III, 24, is a corrections officer from Macon, Ga., whose 
ambition is to become a pro wrestler. Dudley Stokes, 31, is a helicopter pilot 
from Grand Turk, Jamaica, whose life helped inspire a hit movie. Gregory 
Sebald, 30, is an attorney from Minneapolis. Faauuga (Tia) Muagututia, 35, left 
his native Pago Pago to become a special-forces Navy SEAL. Albert Alexander 
Louis Pierre Grimaldi, 35, is the son of a famous actress and is heir to his 
country's throne. Joseph Almasian, 26, toils in an automobile repair shop in 
Pawtucket, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Be a flyer, be an islander. 
</P>
<P>
 Be a lawyer, be a sailor. 
</P>
<P>
 Be a prince, be a pauper. 
</P>
<P>
 Be all you can be. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want to be an Olympian, about all you need is a sled. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these six men grew up knowing a bobsled from a bobby pin. This comes 
as a surprise not in the least to the coach of the American team here, Joey 
Kilburn, who says: "We can bring someone in from another sport and, within a 
month, we can teach them how to work with a sled, how to accelerate, how to 
push one properly. And, in one year, they can be on the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every athlete's goal is to be in the Olympics. Our sport gives them the 
window to get in." 
</P>
<P>
 It can open up new worlds not only to a Minnesota mouthpiece or a New England 
fender bender, but to a San Francisco-born boy whose hobby is sailboarding, to 
a student from New Hampshire whose first love is volleyball and to a carpenter 
from suburban Detroit who at 46 still enjoys zipping along on a sled -- not one 
of whom is here competing for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There is clearly something about bobsledding that has made it the Ellis Island 
of the Winter Olympics, opening its portals and carrying a torch for 
practically anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for instance: THE MASKED AMERICAN 
</P>
<P>
 "Ric Flair has sent me a few faxes here," Chip Minton says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ric Flair the, uh . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The wrestler," he says, surprised you don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Some boys from Georgia grow up watching Hank Aaron on TV, or Richard Petty on 
TV, or Dominique Wilkins on TV. Chip Minton grew up watching Ric Flair on TV. 
Ric Flair is a wrestler with very blond hair, very large legs and very tight 
tights. Chip Minton likes Ric Flair. Chip Minton would like to be like Ric 
Flair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to help me get back in the gym, soon as I get home," says Minton, 
who intends to put aside his career as a Georgia correctional officer and put 
fork to plate until his weight balloons from its present 215 pounds to around 
250, 260. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of work to do if I'm going to make it in that sport," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 On a Sunday morning on a hilltop in Norway, in weather so cold it would make 
an Eskimo tremble, the thought that warms Chip Minton's heart is the image of 
him leaping off the top rope and onto some behemoth's throat, some mighty World 
Championship Wrestling hero (or villain) like the ones he loved as a child, 
like, oh . . . who, Chip? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, like Andre the Giant," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder his bobsled partner looks amused. Jim Herberich, 30, is the driver 
of their USA sled, Minton his brakeman. Herberich is a Harvard grad. He is 
employed as a hydrologist who specializes in protecting the environment. But in 
everything he ever does in his life, or everything he has done already, there 
is one thing that has never once crossed Herberich's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 He says, "No, I can honestly say as a Harvard man that I have never once 
considered the possibility of becoming a wrestler." THE COOL JAMAICAN 
</P>
<P>
 "Cool Runnings" was more than a Walt Disney movie to Dudley Stokes. It was his 
story. It was his brother Nelson's story. It was his hobbin'-and-a-bobbin' 
sledmates' story. It was the coolest, mon. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving everybody a good laugh -- and having one themselves -- at Calgary 
in 1988, the Jamaican bobsledders got serious. They began to improve. And they 
became an inspiration to other tropical bobsledders, who began copycatting the 
cool runners from Kingston with teams of their own -- Puerto Rico, Trinidad and 
Tobago, the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaica's is still the original. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're from a Third World country, but we've been able to put together a team 
and an organization," says Stokes, who flies jet copters for the island's Air 
Force. "You break it down into do-able pieces and it doesn't seem so 
intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it says that, in bits and pieces, anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Steel, a movie mogul who visited Lillehammer last week, was one of the 
first to be amazed by the phrase, "Jamaican bobsledders?" and see its 
entertainment potential. She produced the movie that delighted audiences, even 
if it did take a liberty or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes said: "I was a little nervous going in, but very impressed after seeing 
it. I'm aware that Walt Disney is a business and that they were doing the movie 
because there was a profit to be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley's younger brother, who will be in Jamaica's four-man sled here next 
weekend, said: "I like the part where John Candy walks into the room and talks 
to the driver and asks why he cheated in the Olympics, and he says a gold medal 
is a wonderful thing, but that if you're not good enough without one, then 
you're not good enough with one. That, I liked." THE GRECIAN FORMULA 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Sebald was watching Olympic hockey on TV two years ago and thinking how 
much fun being an Olympian would be. His sister, Greta, meanwhile, happened to 
travel to Greece in search of the family's roots. 
</P>
<P>
 She found a grandfather, Poulos, 93, neither of them knew they had. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he existed and he didn't know we existed," Greta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Light bulbs came on above their heads. Gary chose bobsled -- the window. He 
attended an instructional school in Canada. Greta chose the luge. She took 
leave from her marketing job with the United Way of St. Paul, Minn., and gave 
it a try. Next thing she knew, Greece -- the home of the Olympics -- was 
anointing her its first Olympic luger.  
</P>
<P>
 As for Greg, he had a sport, he had a team; now all he needed was a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made eight billion calls," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Where could he find a second Greek bobsledder? 
</P>
<P>
 He called overseas. He called American colleges, making background checks. 
Finally he found Christodoulos Marinos, 28, a graduate of that ever-popular 
bobsled academy, Aristotle University. He was studying in the States, but said 
he would be happy to make time for a little diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 That was how Greg Sebald became an Olympian, even though he had never even sat 
inside a bobsled until a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but I was captain of my law firm's basketball team," he said. THE GOIN' 
SAMOAN 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hickey, a coach who has been giving Tia Muagututia tips on how to make a 
bobsled go faster, says, "The man really has no fear of anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
 You would think so, wouldn't you? 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the elite-unit Navy SEALS, for which no more than 5% of Naval 
personnel qualifies and which has a huge attrition rate, Tia is a tough 
5-foot-10, 185-pounder who might not be as large as some of the Samoans who 
play pro football, but who can handle himself anywhere, anytime. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his first bobsled ride, Tia recalled, "My heart was going 100 beats a 
second. Man, it was scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, he and Brad Kiltz have become American Samoa's first Winter 
Olympians. Tia came to like this bobsled ride. He said, "It's probably not as 
bad as jumping out of an airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Samoans caught Jamaica's act, they wanted one of their own. So why call 
Tia? 
</P>
<P>
 "I know why," he said. "They needed somebody crazy enough to ride in their 
sled, that's why." THE FRESH PRINCE 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't easy getting used to that room in the Olympic village with all the 
other athletes. He says, "The bed's a little narrow." 
</P>
<P>
 When you are His Serene Highness, Prince Albert of Monaco, Marquis des Baux, 
you easily get accustomed to a king-sized. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are all those other guys around the dorm who call out "Hey, 
Albert!" the ones who ask if he would mind posing with them for a photo. He 
says, "No, of course not." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Prince Rainier and the late actress-princess, Grace Kelly, is happy 
to oblige. He has fancied himself an athlete all his life. Javelin thrower in 
college, swimmer, skier, rower, fencer, handball player and black belt in judo, 
Albert Grimaldi is the crown prince of jocks. 
</P>
<P>
 His principality has 5,000 subjects. It's about the size of the Olympic 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 But both are home to him. This is the royal sledder's third Olympics. Although 
he has never placed among the top 25, it does more than amuse him. After his 
31st-place finish with brakeman Gilbert Bessi in the two-man finals Sunday, 
there was enough competitor in Prince Albert that he said: "I have to find 
fault first in myself. I just haven't driven very well." 
</P>
<P>
 His Highness is a proper fellow. Yet he still remembers his reaction in 1986 
when a coach suggested that bobsledding might be right up his alley, that 
rather than support Monaco's Olympic team, he could be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, do you really think so?" said the Prince. THE ARMENIAN PATRIOTS 
</P>
<P>
 In New England, they wait for news. Much is bad. There was the earthquake of 
1988 that left 25,000 dead and 300,000 homeless. There is poverty and 
oppression, in spite of 1991's declaration of independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Topalian, two-man bobsled partner of Joe Almasian's as the first Winter 
Olympic participants for Armenia, can't bear much more bad news from his 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bosnia is in the news every day, but Armenia is in just as bad a situation," 
Topalian says. "Last year there, 30,000 died. Another 50,000 may die this year 
because of conditions. A million trees were cut down for heat, an ecological 
disaster. Things are bad, very bad." 
</P>
<P>
 As bad as when Almasian's grandmother was hidden by Kurds nearly 80 years ago 
so as not to be captured by invading Turks. By some estimates, as many as 1.5 
million Armenians died in that purge. 
</P>
<P>
 Topalian, 30, is a mechanical engineer who lives in Sherborn, Mass. In the 
aftermath of Armenia's having become a free and independent state, it occurred 
to friends that Topalian and Almasian, good athletes both, could represent 
their people in Lillehammer if they could find the right vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they made 10-hour round trips by car to Lake Placid, N.Y., to learn how to 
bobsled. They paid thousands out of their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Almasian said: "People ask who our sponsors are. I tell them, 'You're looking 
at them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Joe and Ken placed 36th Sunday, ahead of six other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Armenia has been in the Winter Olympics," Almasian said. "Bless our country 
and hooray for bobsled."

HOCH'S FINAL ROUND IS A REAL BLOCKBUSTER; BOB HOPE GOLF: HE RELAXES AFTER 
WATCHING MOVIES AND WINS BY THREE WHEN NO ONE MAKES A MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A lot of things were going through Scott Hoch's mind Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a four-stroke lead going into the final round of the $1.1-million Bob 
Hope Chrysler Classic and he was thinking about how he was going to play the 
final round at Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also thinking of the last time he had a four-stroke lead going into the 
final round. It was the 1987 Memorial. He played poorly in that final round and 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Augusta. With Hoch, 38, there will always be Augusta. He can't 
forget that two-foot putt he missed to lose the Masters in 1989 because 
everybody keeps reminding him about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had to take my mind off of everything and go watch a movie," Hoch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He watched three. His mind was at ease. And so was his swing Sunday at Indian 
Wells, where he shot a two-under-par 70 for a 90-hole tournament total of 
26-under 334 and a three-stroke victory over Fuzzy Zoeller (66), Jim Gallagher 
(67) and Lennie Clements (67). 
</P>
<P>
 Payne Stewart had the day's best round, a 63, and finished alone in fifth at 
338. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch's fifth career victory in a 15-year career, and his first since the 1989 
Las Vegas Invitational, was worth $198,000 to move his career earnings to 
$4,109,524. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really feels great," Hoch said. "It's been a long time since I've won. I 
was getting nervous thinking so much about it last night. That's why I had to 
go out and watch some movies." 
</P>
<P>
 The first movie he watched, "On Deadly Ground" starring Steven Seagal, 
provided the inspiration he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an action movie," he said. "It was just the kind of movie I needed to 
get me in a frame of mind to kick butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch was determined to play aggressively, but he didn't want to overdo it and 
make some foolish mistakes, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fine line between aggressive play and being too bold," he said. "My 
caddie kept telling me all day that all I had to do was make pars and make the 
field catch me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch's thinking was that he wanted to be aggressive on the par-fives and the 
short par-fours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew there were going to be some birdies made," he said. "I wanted to make 
mine on the holes I knew I could reach with a short iron and play for pars on 
the others." 
</P>
<P>
 As the final round unfolded, Hoch didn't have much to worry about. Nobody made 
a serious run at him, and the few players who got close either ran out of holes 
or stopped making birdies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Glasson, who started the day tied for second, took himself out of 
contention at the ninth hole when he hit two drives out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 John Huston played at par and fell back gradually. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements came the closest to applying pressure. He birdied three of the first 
five holes, then birdied the ninth to make the turn in 32 to move to within two 
strokes of Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the start I needed, but I couldn't make anything happen on the back 
nine," Clements said. "I was trying to do something, but the putts weren't 
falling." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch birdied the 11th and 14th holes to stretch his lead to four strokes. 
After that, the only suspense was in the race for second place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was still trying to catch him with four holes to play," Clements said. "But 
when he birdied 14, it was over. I'm happy with where I finished. If it had 
been a little closer, I might have been disappointed, but this is the most I 
have ever been under par. It puts me in a good frame of mind for San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher also made his brief move with three birdies on the front side. 
</P>
<P>
 "What hurt me was not making birdie on eight and 13 (the par fives). I knew I 
was getting close on the front, but Scott played well and did the things he 
needed to do to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch had a couple of anxious moments on the front side. A palm tree stopped 
his drive from going out of bounds on the 517-yard fifth hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only tree out there, and I was lucky the tree knocked the ball 
down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch laid up with his second shot, then hit a sand wedge to six feet to make 
his birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 A gallery marshal cost him a stroke at the seventh hole when his drive hit the 
marshal in the leg. The ball came to rest behind a tree. Hoch had to chip back 
to the fairway and wound up with a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch came back to birdie the eighth hole and par the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch peeked at the scoreboard and knew he had a two-stroke lead. He birdied 
the 11th with an eight-foot putt, had a couple of scrambling pars and then had 
a scrambling birdie at the 483-yard 14th. He went from the rough to a bunker, 
then blasted to within a foot and tapped it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the key shot," Hoch said of his 60-foot bunker shot. "I'm not 
usually too good with those, but that one was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he bogeyed the 17th, his lead was so safe, he teed off on the 
501-yard 18th with an iron. He played it safe all the way in and two-putted 
from 20 feet for his par. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch is happy that he won, but he knows that the stigma of the Masters won't 
be soon forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's nice to be remembered for something," he said. "There are times 
when I'm introduced to people who aren't golf fans, but when they are told that 
I'm the one who missed that short putt, they say, 'Oh, yeah, I remember him.'  
</P>
<P>
 "But at least I had my shot. That's why I felt good when Dan Jansen won that 
gold medal after everything he had been through. It really inspired me. I'm 
always looking for inspirational things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, the inspiration came from the movies. Hoch will take it.

IT'S MARLIN WHO HOOKS THE BIG ONE; AUTO RACING: HE HAS BARELY ENOUGH GAS FOR 
HIS FIRST VICTORY, THE DAYTONA 500. EARNHARDT IS SEVENTH.

 No family in stock car racing history ever drove in as many Winston Cup races 
without winning as the Marlins of Columbia, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Coo Coo, the daddy of the clan, drove in 165 races before retiring in 1976 
without a victory. Sterling, the son, drove in 278 of them before he broke the 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
 When he did it, he did it right--in the biggest race of all, the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling Marlin became the 36th winner of the Super Bowl of stock racing 
Sunday when his red and yellow Kodak Chevrolet fought off the challenge of 
Ernie Irvan's Ford in what might have been the most competitive race ever held 
at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 33 leader changes among 13 drivers in the 200 laps--and that didn't 
count some laps where there was passing for the lead in every corner of the 2 
1/2-mile tri-oval. Leader changes are counted only at the start-finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was Irvan whom Marlin replaced on the Morgan-McClure team after 
Irvan left to take over for the late Davey Allison on Robert Yates' Havoline 
Ford team. The finish reversed the order of the 1991 race, which Irvan won with 
Marlin second. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means a lot to me and my daddy to win the Daytona 500 because this is 
where he drove his first superspeedway race," Marlin said. "I watched him win a 
125-miler (qualifying race) here in 1973 and I was in his pits when he almost 
won the 500 a couple of times, and he was here when I almost won three years 
ago. So it was just great, just unbelievable to win it." 
</P>
<P>
 Coo Coo finished fourth behind Richard Petty in 1974 and fourth again to Cale 
Yarborough in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt, the six-time Winston Cup champion who was nearly everyone's 
choice to win his first Daytona 500 in his 16th try, led for 45 laps, but faded 
down the stretch and finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a championship and there's always next year to win the Daytona 
500," Earnhardt said. "I've tried 16 times and haven't done it yet. We'll come 
back next year. I'll be another year older, but that's the only way I can look 
at it right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt led as late as lap 141 and appeared to be laying in wait to make one 
of his famous moves only to slide down the leader board in the last 20 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car was just too loose today," he said. "We'd won three in a row (Twin 
125, IROC and Busch Grand National races), but I didn't think we'd used up all 
our luck. I really wanted the gold today, but we didn't even get the bronze." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan finished 0.23 seconds behind the winner, with Terry Labonte and Jeff 
Gordon third and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 A yellow caution flag on lap 141, caused by debris on the track, set up a 
dramatic battle of fuel consumption. Most of the leaders, including Irvan, 
Earnhardt and Gordon, ducked into the pits to top off their fuel shortly before 
the green flag came out on lap 146. Marlin and Mark Martin, who had been racing 
with the leaders all day, did not come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Two laps from the finish, Martin was running in third place when his gas tank 
ran dry going down the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I breathed a little easier when I saw Mark go dry," Marlin said. "I knew if 
the three of us raced to the finish, the Fords (Martin and Irvan) would gang up 
on me. I figured I could beat them one on one." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next five miles, Marlin's crew and most of the 150,000 spectators were 
wondering if Marlin would suffer the same fuel fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (crew chief Tony Glover) had said on the radio that some of the teams 
were coming back in to top off," Marlin said. "I asked, 'Guys, what do you want 
me to do?' They told me to stay out, that we had enough to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, he did. The Chevrolet ran out of fuel as Marlin came down pit row 
to enter Victory Circle. He might have made it all the way, but crews up and 
down the long pit lane ran out to congratulate the popular Marlin, who stopped 
to exchange high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty emotional for me right then," Marlin said. "I was one of those 
guys, crewing for my daddy, for years, and I know a lot of them boys. And they 
know how much I appreciate what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Yates, owner of Irvan's car and the man who picked Irvan to sit in Allison's 
seat, said: "I'm happy for Sterling, since he didn't run out of gas, dadgummit. 
They were tight on fuel, but they made it, that's all that counts." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan, who left the McClure-Morgan team in midseason last year under anything 
but happy circumstances, said he gave it everything he had to beat his former 
team, but he couldn't catch Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to make a run at him, but when I pushed off Turn Four I didn't have 
anything left," Irvan said. "The handling was great during the middle of the 
race, but we just didn't quite have it right at the end. It's nobody's fault, 
it's just part of racing." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-four of the 42 starters were running at the finish of the 3-hour 
11-minute 10-second race, a record for the Daytona 500. Twelve of them finished 
on the same lap with Marlin. Marlin, who led 30 laps, averaged 156.931 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Two accidents early in the race knocked seven drivers, including Rusty 
Wallace, out of the race. In the first one, Robert Pressley tagged the wall 
coming out of the fourth turn on lap 62 and when he bounced back across the 
track, it set off a tangle of crumpled cars. Ten cars were involved, although 
some returned after being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Gant, making his final Daytona 500 start, was one of them. Gant's crew 
patched up his Chevrolet and he chugged around the track, 35 laps behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like the 54 car (Pressley) blew a tire or something," Wallace said. 
"I picked a hole and was going for it, but Hut (Stricklin) couldn't get slowed 
down and got into the rear of me. It wasn't his fault. It was just one of those 
deals." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight laps later, Todd Bodine was preparing to take over the lead when Irvan 
suddenly slowed. Bodine was hit by Gordon, knocking his car sideways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what he was thinking," Bodine said. "I guess he was just pumped 
up . . . but when you're running 190 or 195 (m.p.h.) at Daytona, you don't do 
that stuff." Daytona 500 Finish 04,26,23,09,06 Driver Hometown Car Laps 1.

DUCKS TRADE TUGNUTT TO CANADIENS FOR LEBEAU; HOCKEY: CENTER IS SAID TO BE FULLY 
RECOVERED FROM SEVERELY SPRAINED ANKLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks parted with half of what was once their No. 1 and 1-A 
goaltending tandem Sunday, trading Ron Tugnutt to Montreal for Stephan Lebeau, 
a center who had 31 goals and 80 points for the Stanley Cup champions last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau is expected to help an offense that ranks 23rd on the power play and 
has scored on only five of its last 60 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hate to see a guy like Tugger go, he's done so well for us and been 
everything we've asked for and an important part of our first year," Coach Ron 
Wilson said. "(But) we felt our organization is very deep in goal, that's our 
strongest asset, and we can afford to give up Ron Tugnutt to bolster our 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal -- the Ducks' first since the season began -- formally stamped Guy 
Hebert as the Ducks' No. 1 goalie, a role he has assumed in the past month. 
Mikhail Shtalenkov was called up from minor league San Diego to be the backup. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade also should put the team in a stronger position to contend with the 
San Jose Sharks and the Kings for the final Western Conference playoff spot. 
But General Manager Jack Ferreira, who orchestrated the deal from the Olympics 
in Norway, said it is more a long-term move than a playoff deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's in the back of your mind because we are in the hunt," Ferreira said. 
"But we also knew we needed to upgrade our power play and needed a finisher and 
another playmaker anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau, who will turn 26 on Feb. 28, was the Canadiens' fourth-leading scorer 
last season, but a severely sprained ankle this season has limited him to only 
34 games, and he has only nine goals and seven assists. However, he has played 
in the Canadiens' last two games after sitting out the previous five weeks 
because of the injury, and Wilson says he is now 100% sound.  
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt will be the backup to Patrick Roy, perhaps the best goalie in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little bit disappointed," Tugnutt said. "I think that things were going 
very well here. I was enjoying California and more than anything I was enjoying 
the players here. It was fun being a part of a new franchise that has a chance 
to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about the chance of winning the Stanley Cup, it's a great hockey 
team. But I was also very excited to come to Anaheim because I was going to get 
a chance to play. I understand already that I won't be getting much ice time, 
so that's going to be very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the Ducks said their goodbys to Tugnutt, the players who once 
played with Lebeau in Montreal spoke of him enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephan Lebeau is a very gifted player, he's got great hands and on special 
teams he's phenomenal," former Canadien Todd Ewen said. "I think he'll really 
improve our power play for one and he's got a good work ethic so he'll fit 
right in. . . . He's going to really help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau is a native of the province of Quebec and has played his entire career 
with the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the feeling that I was going to be traded and I was very happy it was 
to Anaheim," he said. "It's a new team and for me I think I'm going to have 
chance to play more and play the style of hockey I can play."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; SPIRITS WERE SOARING 
-- AND SO WERE THE ATHLETES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If there's one thing Norwegians go as nuts about as cross-country skiing, it's 
ski jumping. It's also Nordic, natch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic airborne troops leaped off the big hill here Sunday and they had a 
big crowd to appreciate their efforts. Big -- 40,000 were there -- and up for 
it. The local favorite, Espen Bredesen, was the gold-medal favorite and had the 
crowd excited to begin with, and about half the folks there, even those with 
seats, never sat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredesen was outjumped and had to settle for silver -- he said he was pleased 
and proud to have it -- but it really made little difference to the faithful 
assembled. They had a great time. 
</P>
<P>
 They did the wave -- you haven't lived if you haven't seen the wave done with 
thousands of Norwegian flags -- they bopped to a hot jazz band, they cringed 
audibly when jumpers Randy Weber and Staffan Taellberg crashed after landing, 
they yodeled when Austrian Andreas Goldberger got off a good jump and they 
clanged their cowbells for no particular reason at all. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? It was a beautiful, sunshine-bright winter day begging to be 
enjoyed. Cold, of course, but not unbearably so if you were dressed properly -- 
and had a buffer of some kind to put between your feet or fanny and the snow, 
which has been collecting in the stadium since winter began sometime last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting couldn't have been more beautiful. You could look up the hill at 
the double-barreled ski slides and watch skiers' efforts to defy gravity, then 
turn slightly and know that humans are always going to come off second best in 
any contest with nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing manufactured will ever match the pristine beauty of the Norwegian 
countryside in its winter cloak, and it's all there for the looking. Just peek 
behind the Olympic flame and there it is, as far as the eye can see. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the competition, Norwegian jumpers drew the biggest cheers, of course, 
but, just as at the cross-country course, the talents of all the competitors 
were applauded and good jumps drew enthusiastic response even if it meant Norge 
would not carry this particular day. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the nice things about this country. Second place isn't viewed as 
some kind of horrid disgrace. And a day in the sunshine can be its own reward.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; HARDING APPEARS SET TO GO; FIGURE SKATING: 
AFTER TWO BAD DAYS OF PRACTICE, SHE LANDS THREE CONSECUTIVE TRIPLE AXELS AND 
SAYS THAT HER ANKLE IS FEELING BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every move Tonya Harding made in her two practices Sunday on the Olympic 
Amphitheatre's training rink was dissected, analyzed and discussed by her 
coach, her choreographer, doctors, physiotherapists, figure skating officials, 
publicists, reporters and photographers. And when the day ended, they all 
declared her fit. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, when the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. enters two names into the 
official draw today for this week's Winter Olympic women's figure skating 
competition, Harding's will be one of them. Nancy Kerrigan's will be the other. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some doubt about Harding after two consecutive days of dismal 
practices, including one Saturday that she left in tears while music from one 
of her programs was still playing. USFSA team leader Gale Tanger wrapped an arm 
around her and gently coaxed her to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanger said later that the USFSA would monitor Harding's practices Sunday to 
determine whether her difficulties were the result of a sore right ankle, which 
has caused her sporadic pain since she suffered a sprain in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that the source of the problem was psychological, her coach, Diane 
Rawlinson, said Saturday: "She's feeling the pressure. She's feeling very 
insecure about being here and having everyone see her as the villain." 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, with so much attention focused on Harding, Kerrigan has faded into 
the background. She has even escaped the security net surrounding the athletes' 
village to attend a couple of speedskating events and a hockey game without 
being mobbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her coach, Evy Scotvold, declared Sunday that she is one of three favorites to 
win the gold medal in the competition that will begin Wednesday with the 
technical program and conclude Friday with the freestyle program. He declined 
to identify the other two. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (episode) has made her stronger and very determined," he said. "If she 
just stays calm, she'll have a fun week." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he could make sure she remains calm, he said: "If I knew how to do 
that, I'd make even more money than Nancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Harding's program, he said: "I haven't watched her program. I don't think 
she's done one since she's been here." 
</P>
<P>
 She kept that record intact Sunday, but Harding, notoriously pedestrian in 
practice, rarely performs complete technical or freestyle programs until she 
competes. 
</P>
<P>
 She hit only one rough spot in her early afternoon practice, missing two jumps 
in a row and then stepping gingerly over to the sideboard, where her support 
group, which includes Rawlinson and Rawlinson's husband, Dennis, and 
choreographer Erica Bakacas, offered encouragement. While Tanger spoke to 
Harding, Bakacas caressed the skater's forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding ended the practice pumping her fist after landing a triple axel, the 
most demanding of the triple jumps and one that only she and Japan's Midori Ito 
have done in women's competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy," Rawlinson said, revealing that Harding's emotional turmoil in 
practice Saturday stemmed from a photo on the front page of a foreign newspaper 
showing Harding topless. She had seen it only that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In between practices, Harding was fitted for a new freestyle-program dress 
that the USFSA had designed for her. The sleeveless, deep purple dress she wore 
in winning the national championship last month in Detroit was considered so 
immodest that at least two judges penalized her with reductions in her scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she needed something more Olympian, an Olympic dress," Tanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harding returned to the training rink for her afternoon practice session, 
she was in good spirits. She still did not perform her entire freestyle program 
but, at one point, landed three consecutive triple axels, a feat for any 
skater, man or woman. 
</P>
<P>
 As she left the ice, a reporter yelled a question about her ankle from the 
balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all right," she said. "It's better." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanger said Harding is undergoing daily ultrasound treatments for her ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think her problem has been the ankle as much as it has been 
timing," she said. "She's getting her timing set to the size of the rink. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she looked very good today. When you see the face of an athlete, and 
they look happy, you usually see a good practice following that. She was happy

 Harding walked out of an interview with CBS correspondent Connie Chung after 
being asked questions about the fairness of judging she will face. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding became agitated when Chung persisted in asking her if she realized she 
was the center of attention not so much for her skating as for the 
investigation of her role in the attack on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chung quoted two Czech judges as saying they would be influenced by 
Harding's admission that she failed to immediately report what she knew about 
the attack, Harding removed her microphone and stormed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to answer that," Harding said. "OK. I'm done. I'm done with 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The interview was scheduled for telecast on the "CBS Evening News" tonight. A 
transcript was provided by CBS in Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Harding said she was taking painkillers for her injured 
ankle.

 Figure skater Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, took time off from her training 
in a rink near Oslo to visit a modern art museum Saturday. But she was not 
catching up on culture as much as she was figure skating history. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is the Henie-Onstad Art Center, which was founded by three-time 
Olympic figure skating champion Sonja Henie and her husband. Kwan was most 
interested in the room that contains dozens of medals and trophies won by Henie 
during her career from 1924-36. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had heard of Sonja Henie, but she didn't know anything about her," said 
Frank Carroll, who coaches Kwan at Lake Arrowhead's Ice Castle International 
Training Center. "She thought she was American because of all her movies. She 
had no idea she was Norwegian." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Kwan is an alternate in the women's competition, she cannot live in 
the athletes' village or train in the official practice rinks in Hamar. So the 
USFSA put her, her coach and her father up in a hotel and rented ice time for 
her in an Oslo suburb, about 60 miles south of Hamar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people at the rink have been extremely cooperative," Carroll said. "Since 
their rink is used mainly for ice hockey, the ice is very hard, like marble. 
But they turned the heat up so the ice would be softer just for us. They said 
the hockey players could live with it for a few days."

 McDowell, who won in arbitration at $4 million last winter, had asked the 
Chicago White Sox for $6.5 million, which would have been the highest one-year 
contract in baseball history.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER; ROBINSON HITS ROAD TO FULFILL A PROMISE

 Soon after last year's football recruiting was completed at USC, and after 
assessing the talent he had inherited from Larry Smith as he embarked on his 
second tour of duty at the school, Coach John Robinson told his staff: "We need 
to have a top-five recruiting class next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The hard work began at the top. Robinson hit the road for a week in May, 
highly unusual for a head coach, so he could evaluate some of the top junior 
prospects in the state. Among the players he watched practice were defensive 
linemen Darrell Russell of San Diego St. Augustine and George Perry of San 
Bernardino, running back Rodney Sermons of La Puente Bishop Amat and wide 
receiver Larry Parker of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson continued to actively recruit during the season. One day after 
practice in November, he flew on a private jet to San Diego to watch Russell 
play in a game that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson set his sights on the best players he and his staff could find, and 
also hoped to re-establish the Trojans' national recruiting presence. Now, a 
year later, Robinson's recruiting class is receiving widespread acclaim as one 
of the best in the country. And among his most significant signees are none 
other than Russell, Perry, Sermons and Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 One publication ranked USC's class No. 1 nationally, another had it No. 2, 
most others put it in the top five. Ranking the recruiting classes is fun for 
fans, but not to be taken too seriously. Kind of like the weekly wire-service 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 Variables such as injuries, eligibility problems and position switches can 
affect the success of a recruiting class, not to mention the physical 
development of some players, plus intangibles such as work ethic, 
"coachability" and just plain luck, factors impossible to measure in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at this time, for example, USC followers were touting the fall 
arrival of star running back Saladin McCullough of Pasadena Muir. But an 
invalid Scholastic Aptitude Test score kept McCullough from making it to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Trojan recruiting class includes several players who have not yet 
qualified academically, but whom USC coaches and academic counselors believe 
were "good risks" to sign conditionally. Those players are top running back 
prospects Delon Washington of Dallas and Marlin Carey of San Diego Mt. Carmel, 
defensive back Ken Haslip of Pasadena Muir and defensive lineman Antoine 
Simpson of La Porte, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping for some immediate help, USC signed 10 community college players out of 
its class of 29, and added sophomore quarterback Bob Otten (6-6, 215), a 
transfer from Weber State. Best of the bunch appears to be wide receiver 
Keyshawn Johnson (6-4, 205) of West L.A. College, cornerback Mario Bradley 
(6-2, 195) of Cerritos and inside linebacker Errick Herrin (6-2, 220) of Mt. 
San Jacinto. All have enrolled at USC, along with Otten. 
</P>
<P>
 USC coaches have told Johnson that they expect him and Parker to compete for 
the starting split end position, opposite returning flanker Ken Grace. In 
addition, Johnson and Bradley could eventually be moved to free safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "What usually happens with that many JC players," said a rival Pac-10 
assistant coach, "is that two or three turn out to be better than you thought, 
two or three turn out to be not as good, and two or three are about what you 
figured." 
</P>
<P>
 Most important for Robinson and his staff, however, was that the Trojans were 
able to beat both UCLA and/or Notre Dame head-to-head for several superb high 
school prospects, including: Russell, whom USC coaches think might wind up as 
an offensive tackle; Sermons; Parker, who was described by USC receivers coach 
Mike Sanford as "a bigger, faster Johnnie Morton"; kicker Adam Abrams (5-9, 
170) of La Jolla; safety Grant Pearsall (6-1, 185) of Villa Park; tight end 
Rome Douglas (6-7, 245) of Claremont, and defensive lineman Marc Matock (6-5, 
235) of Salinas, Calif.

THE TIMES POLL; CONSERVATIVE TREND FOUND IN YOUNGER PRIESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II, whose 15-year reign over the Roman Catholic Church has been 
marked by repeated efforts to restore orthodoxy, may now be succeeding in 
attracting a new crop of more conservative priests to carry the church into the 
next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is too early to say whether there is a sustained drift toward 
orthodoxy, younger priests are clearly more religiously orthodox and 
politically conservative than middle-aged priests, according to a nationwide 
poll of priests by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordained during the pontificate of John Paul, they are less supportive of 
ordaining women and allowing priests to marry than are middle-aged priests, and 
they are less tolerant of married couples using artificial birth control or 
surrogate birth mothers to bring a child to term. 
</P>
<P>
 On other moral issues, such as euthanasia, abortion or sexual relations 
outside of marriage, both younger and middle-aged priests tend to be orthodox 
in their thinking. Only the oldest priests are more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 In the political arena, nearly 40% of priests 35 and younger consider 
themselves conservative -- almost double the percentage between the ages of 36 
and 50. Moreover, the youngest priests are twice as likely to identify with the 
Republican Party (35%) than are priests in general (16%). 
</P>
<P>
 The findings from the poll of 2,087 Roman Catholic priests and 1,049 Roman 
Catholic nuns appear to validate results in recent church-sponsored polls that 
point to greater conservatism among new priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pattern is there in dozens of questions on the poll indicating that the 
traditional character of the 15-year pontificate of John Paul II is clearly 
affecting the selection, or self-selection process, for new candidates for 
ordination," Times Poll Director John Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are among a wealth of information on how priests and nuns view 
their church -- its strengths, its problems and its future. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, significant majorities of priests and nuns are happy in their 
calling, would take their vows again if they had a choice and think well of 
John Paul's job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honest to God," wrote a self-described liberal 61-year-old priest from the 
Northeast, "I am still extremely excited about the gift of faith, the life it 
gives and sustains, the peace beyond all telling (beyond Rome). What a comfort. 
I'm proud to share." 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the vast majority of priests appear to be happy with their 
lives, they are less sanguine about the institutional church in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-three percent of all priests believe it is weaker than it was 30 years 
ago; 29% say it is stronger. Another 10% say the strength of the church is 
about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 A bare majority of priests -- 54% -- call things in the church excellent or 
good, whereas 43% say they're not so good or poor. Nuns are more pessimistic 
still, with 51% assessing things as not so good or poor, compared to 44% who 
believe things are good or excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Priests are fairly evenly divided between those who say things are getting 
better (31%) and worse (33%), with 25% saying things are about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what the greater danger for the church is these days, 42% said it 
was the excessive desire to please secular and humanistic forces in society; 
28% said it was resistance to reform of moral doctrines. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that a disproportionate number of priests (95%) are white at a 
time when the ethnic diversity of the church in the United States is demanding 
new approaches to ministry. However, 24% of all priests now speak Spanish, with 
more than two of five priests 35 or younger speaking that language. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of Catholics continues to grow, priests and nuns say when 
people leave the church they do so because of both shortcomings by the 
institutional church, the influence of materialism and secular culture, and a 
lack of faith and commitment by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most intriguing finding has to do with a possible drift toward 
orthodoxy by the newest and youngest of priests. 
</P>
<P>
 They are more conservative as a group than are middle-aged priests, who were 
ordained and matured in the priesthood during the 1960s, when the Second 
Vatican Council ushered in an era of renewal and reform within the church. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the new priests were trained during a time when John Paul has 
steadfastly championed a return to orthodoxy, emphasized that the church's 
moral teachings are unchangeable, elevated conservative priests to the 
episcopacy, and made clear his unflinching opposition to artificial birth 
control, women priests, married priests, "cafeteria Catholicism" and dissenting 
theologians. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 20% of all priests between the ages of 36 and 60 describe 
themselves as religiously conservative, but 32% of the youngest priests do so. 
Only priests older than 70 are more conservative as a group, the poll found. In 
the oldest group, 49% call themselves religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts within the church disagree whether the more conservative complexion of 
the youngest group of priests constitutes a trend toward an orthodox 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be wary about saying you have a trend here," said the Rev. Andrew W. 
Greeley, a Catholic sociologist, author and associate at the National Opinion 
Research Center in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But church sociologist Dean Hoge of Catholic University of America in 
Washington said that The Times' findings replicate those in separate 
church-sponsored polls. Hoge said there is "a very definite trend" toward 
conservatism by younger priests -- at least on issues involving the priesthood, 
if not always on moral issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Given John Paul's appointment of conservative bishops and other efforts to 
restore orthodoxy, the growing number of conservatives among new priests isn't 
surprising, said Richard A. Schoenherr, a sociology of religion professor at 
the University of Wisconsin and author of "Full Pews, Empty Altars." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that was predictable with regard to the kind of church the 
current Pope is trying to construct," Schoenherr said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But he and Brennan noted that the youngest priests account for just 6% of the 
total priest population in the United States. And despite the greater 
percentage of conservatives within their group, most young priests still 
consider themselves moderates or liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evolution toward orthodoxy and the Republican Party will no doubt take 
some time," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the signs of increased conservatism among the current group of 
new, young priests is unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
 On a raft of issues, the youngest priests are more closely aligned with the 
Pope and the most orthodox members of the hierarchy. These priests are more 
likely to approve of how John Paul has handled his duties as Supreme Pontiff, 
and say that the Pope's views on moral issues are "about right." 
</P>
<P>
 They are also more apt to oppose a declaration of rights for dissenting 
Catholic theologians. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, for example, in a landmark encyclical letter to the world's 
bishops, the Pope said that if Catholic theologians fail to be faithful to 
church teachings they should be stripped of the title "Catholic" and barred 
from teaching at Catholic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 A 29-year-old priest from the Midwest who described himself as a religious 
conservative agrees with the papal directive. "There exists in the Roman 
Catholic Church too much pick-and-choose Catholicism," he wrote on his 
questionnaire. "To be considered Catholic, one must accept all that the church 
teaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering John Paul's uncompromising belief that artificial birth control is 
morally evil, he would not likely be pleased that only 48% of the youngest 
priests say that it is always or often sinful. But there is even less support 
from middle-aged priests -- 36% of those between ages 36 and 50, and 37% among 
those 51 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 The church condemns homosexual acts and not homosexuality per se, so the 
ordination of celibate homosexuals is not strictly forbidden. But support for 
such ordinations varies among priests, with 53% in support and 41% in 
opposition. The youngest and middle aged priests were more enthusiastic. 
Sixty-eight percent of those 35 or younger favor ordaining celibate homosexual 
men, and 69% of those age 35 to 50 are in favor. Priests over 70 oppose the 
idea 61% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that higher percentages of younger priests are conservative, 
an orthodox restoration won't come overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan noted that those between ages 36 and 60 account for almost half the 
priest population. And despite their Republican drift, most of the younger 
priests are still Democrats (32%) or independents (29%). 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear why higher numbers of the new priests are more religiously 
orthodox and politically conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities within the church suggest several reasons. The first is 
self-selection. "It's not that seminary training has been changed. It's who 
self-selected themselves to enter seminary," said Hoge at Catholic University 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor may be that the youngest priests grew up in the Reagan-Bush 
era. Greeley called it the "period effect." 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that were ordained in the '60s grew up in the '60s, which was a 
radical era," he said. "The people who are being ordained now grew up in a more 
conservative era." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of age or religious ideology, by far the biggest problem listed by 
priests is the shortage of priests. Nearly 60% of all priests favored the idea 
of allowing married priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church will continue to languish as long as we maintain that only 
celibates may serve in the priesthood," said a 57-year-old priest in the South. 
"The laity want service and holy priests and could care less about marital 
status." 
</P>
<P>
 There are any number of other explanations for the shortfall in vocations. 
Some believe the scandal of child sexual abuse has taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message I get in general is this thing about sexual abuse by clergy has 
been a real downer for the priesthood," said Hoge. "It has been absolutely the 
worst thing that's happened. The people around here just wish to God it hadn't 
happened. It's taking a toll on everybody, taking a toll on finances, and on 
people entering the priesthood." 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. bishops continue to put new safeguards in place, support groups 
for clergy sexual abuse victims say the church has not done enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than half (41%) of the priests surveyed said they considered pedophilia 
within the priesthood as a "very serious" problem. Another 31% called it 
somewhat serious, and 18% called it not too serious or not at all serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Many priests in written explanations, however, stressed that they were unsure 
how to respond, saying that even one case would be very serious but that they 
did not want to indicate the problem was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said the question was phrased as it was not to measure the potential 
amount of child sexual abuse but the intensity of priests' attitudes about the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, one case of clergy pedophilia is serious -- very serious," said a 
66-year-old priest in the Midwest. "But if you speak of the number of cases or 
actual clerical offenders it is a very small percentage, much smaller than that 
of other professional people." 
</P>
<P>
 Told of the explanation, Greeley, who has severely criticized the church for 
its slow response in the past, said he was astounded. "They don't think it's a 
serious problem! But it is an enormous problem!" 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Berry, the author of a book on the problem, has estimated that between 
1984 and 1992, more than 400 Catholic priests in North America were reported to 
have molested children. As of that time, he estimated, the church had paid out 
$400 million to resolve the cases. THE TIMES POLL: Serving a Diverse Flock

Refused 1% 3% Source: Times Poll of priests and nuns conducted between 
September, 1993, and January, 1994. How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 This Times Poll is based on interviews with 2,087 Roman Catholic priests and 
1,049 Roman Catholic nuns in dioceses across the United States, including 
Puerto Rico. The survey was conducted by mail from September, 1993, through 
this past January. It represents responses to a mailing of 5,000 questionnaires 
to priests in 80 dioceses and 2,500 to nuns in 45 dioceses. The samples of 
dioceses were chosen from a list that gives the total number of priests and 
nuns in all dioceses nationwide. Respondents within targeted dioceses were then 
chosen randomly from available lists. The questionnaires, in English and 
Spanish, were self-administered and anonymous, though some respondents 
volunteered to be interviewed and quoted by name. Both samples were weighted 
slightly to account for variations in the number of responses received from 
each diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 The demographics of both surveys have been examined by academic experts in the 
field of priests and nuns sociology and have been found comparable to previous 
research in this area. The margin of sampling error for the survey of priests 
is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for the survey of nuns it is plus or 
minus 4 points. In both polls, results based on subgroups may have a somewhat 
higher sampling error. Poll results can also be affected by other factors such 
as wording of questions and the reluctance of some respondents to participate 
in surveys.

SERBS COMPLYING ON PULLOUT, U.N. SAYS; AIR STRIKES AVERTED; BALKANS: SOME HEAVY

 A NATO deadline to Serbian gunners besieging the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo 
expired in uneasy silence early today, with some heavy weapons still aimed at 
the city but enough gone to rule out immediate air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials authorized to call for NATO air strikes said some Serbian guns 
were not surrendered or removed from a 12-mile zone around Sarajevo after the 
deadline of 1 a.m. today local time (4 p.m. Sunday Pacific time). They said 
that in some cases wintry weather prevented the weapons' removal. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials from the United Nations, NATO and the Clinton Administration 
said enough progress had been made to avert air strikes for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am satisfied we have achieved effective compliance. I have decided that it 
is not necessary at this stage for me to request NATO to use air power," said 
Yasushi Akashi, the senior U.N. official in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in a statement 
released at his Zagreb, Croatia, headquarters and at NATO headquarters in 
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Jeremy Boorda, the four-star American admiral who commands NATO forces 
in Naples, is "exactly of the same opinion as myself." 
</P>

 President Clinton said air strikes are unnecessary "at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 But, in a statement read by Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, he said: "Despite 
the significant events of the day, we must remain vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "All parties should be aware that the ultimatum stands. The deadline has not 
been extended. Any heavy weapons in the exclusion zone not under U.N. control 
are, and will remain, subject to air strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said early today that he had agreed in 
telephone calls with Clinton to keep the threat of air strikes intact in case 
weapons are moved back toward Sarajevo or the city is attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The acknowledged violations of NATO's 10-day ultimatum for all heavy weaponry 
to be removed or disabled prompted Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to 
appeal for immediate Western intervention to punish the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew very well of the weather conditions, and they did nothing for seven 
days," the Muslim president wrote in a message to Woerner. "They are guilty for 
not doing this on time. . . . I think that heavy weaponry that remains tonight 
after midnight should be a target for NATO air strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb forces that have shelled the city for nearly two years did 
not respond at first to NATO's demand to surrender or remove their heavy 
weapons from the exclusion zone. But the ultimatum did halt shelling that has 
claimed 10,000 lives in the city in the past 22 months. 
</P>
<P>
 And by late last week, Serbian weapons began withdrawing from hillsides around 
the city after Russia promised to add troops to the peacekeeping force there. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimatum was set after a shell killed 68 people in a Sarajevo market on 
Feb. 5. It was the worst single massacre of the Bosnian civil war, shocking the 
world and forcing the United States and Russia to take a leading role in the 
search for an end to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 In Naples, Italy, lights burned toward dawn today at North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization headquarters. Any decision to attack remaining emplacements would 
come only after daylight examination of them and political consultations among 
NATO partners, senior officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been ready, and we remain ready," said NATO spokesman James Mitchell, a 
U.S. Navy captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the British commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia who 
would summon any strikes, said late Sunday that he was "cautiously optimistic" 
that they would not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we will not have to use air strikes tomorrow," Rose said. "If there 
are breaches of the cease-fire tomorrow, I will have no hesitation of calling 
down air strikes. . . . But I don't expect that to be the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, en route back to Washington from a defense 
ministers' meeting at Aviano Air Base in northern Italy, called the decision to 
hold off on air strikes "really great news" and "an enormous relief," but he 
said U.N. forces would have to continue to watch the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very good news, but it's not over yet," he said. "They are going to 
continue to watch, and if we find more artillery pieces, if artillery pieces 
move in the future, then we have to reconsider this." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who 
traveled to Italy with Perry, said it could be several days before the allies 
know for sure whether the Serbs have fully complied. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said the Serbian surrender of artillery went slowly and painfully right 
up until the final hours on Sunday, with U.N. forces ultimately visiting each 
of the Serbian weapons sites individually to take possession of guns, tanks, 
mortars and rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 He said NATO reconnaissance planes will continue flying over the Sarajevo 
area, with a view toward confirming that the Serbs have surrendered their 
weapons as ordered. Reconnaissance efforts were hampered over the weekend by 
bad weather, but analysts say the weather now is improving. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior official returning to Washington with Perry told reporters that the 
United States had offered to send sophisticated TPQ-36 and TPQ-37 
artillery-locating radar to help pinpoint Serbian weapons but had declined to 
send ground troops to operate them and was trying to train British or French 
troops to take those posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain and France already have contributed seven units of French-built 
Cymbeline mortar-locating radar, complete with the necessary ground crews. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, some Bosnian Serb gunmen manning artillery emplacements under the 
control of nearby U.N. troops brushed off the potential risks of failing to 
comply with the NATO ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not afraid of the West," said Zoran Pijevic, 28. "In the event of 
(NATO) intervention, the Serbs and the Russians will see to it that Vienna 
doesn't exist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Serb rebel resentment driving the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina stems 
from a sense of historic injustice at the hands of foreign powers such as 
nonaligned Austria, which occupied the republic until World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 Pijevic's half brother, 24-year-old Goran, boasted that the Russian U.N. 
troops had come to shore up the Serbian side and that their presence meant NATO 
had given up intentions to target rebel installations.

 For the past two decades, Philadelphia personal injury lawyer Gene Locks has 
been battling asbestos companies throughout the United States, becoming a 
millionaire in the process. Now, Locks says, "the victims have won the war" 
against 20 surrendering defendants in a $1.2-billion settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fred Baron, a Dallas personal injury lawyer and former Locks ally who also 
has become a millionaire representing asbestos victims, contends that the 
proposed settlement is a corrupt, unconstitutional sellout of the injured 
people it purports to help. The beneficiaries, he asserts, would be companies 
who maimed the workers and greedy lawyers who were supposed to assist them. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the fairness of the massive class-action pact will begin this 
week in Philadelphia federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves big issues, big egos and big bucks. And whatever happens, it 
will have a significant impact on many lives. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 27 million people were exposed to asbestos on the job between 1940 
and 1979, according to studies done by doctors at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New 
York. About 350,000 of them will develop fatal cancer as a result and more than 
1 million will suffer from non-malignant asbestos-related diseases. More than 
100,000 have died already. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is how, when and whether tens of thousands of people will be 
compensated for injuries ranging from minor respiratory problems to 
mesothelioma, a rare cancer of the lining of the lungs caused only by asbestos 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the traditional lawsuit system, the agreement would create an 
administrative procedure for processing injury claims against the 20 companies. 
Proponents say this would mean more efficient resolution of claims, but 
opponents say it would deny thousands of people their right to a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
 If the settlement is approved, it will affect thousands currently suffering 
from asbestos-related diseases. Perhaps more controversial, it would affect the 
rights of thousands of others around the country who have not yet become ill 
and may be unaware that they were exposed to asbestos or that their legal 
rights are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who missed a Jan. 24 deadline to opt out of the proposed settlement 
would be bound by it. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also could set a precedent for the way other courts handle 
massive toxic tort cases, such as those involving defective breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia pact comes at a critical moment in the labyrinthine history 
of asbestos litigation, which has been described as a "high-rise Bleak House," 
a contemporary version of Charles Dickens' 19th-Century novel about an English 
family who become ensnared in a never-ending court case. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges around the country have expressed frustration over how to process the 
more than 100,000 pending asbestos suits. In 1990, Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court formed a special commission on the issue. A 
year later it released a report saying: "What has been a frustrating problem is 
becoming a disaster of major proportions to both the victims and the producers 
of asbestos products, which the courts are ill-equipped to meet effectively . . 
. future claimants may lose altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 The report called for congressional action, which has not occurred, and for 
streamlined court procedures. Soon after, 26,000 pending federal suits were 
transferred to the federal district court in Philadelphia for expedited 
handling. But the cases got bogged down there too. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, a consortium of 20 companies called the Center for Claims 
Resolution (CCR) -- including Armstrong World Industries, Pfizer, Union Carbide 
and U.S. Gypsum Co. -- came to Locks and another leading plaintiffs' lawyer, 
Ronald L. Motley of Charleston, S.C., and proposed a deal that would resolve 
thousands of suits and create a mechanism to settle future cases. After months 
of bargaining, a deal was struck and filed with the court on Jan. 15, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The settlement is a responsible, reasonable and fair proposal for resolving a 
litigation morass that has worked to the disadvantage of all involved -- 
including the courts, the defendants . . . and the victims of asbestos," Motley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal came under attack immediately. "It is nothing more than an 
attempt to make a private agreement between CCR, Locks and Motley binding on 
third parties," said Pittsburgh lawyer Thomas Henderson, who also represents 
asbestos victims. Under the settlement, Locks and Motley were designated as 
counsel for the class of future victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has the settlement created deep divisions among plaintiffs' lawyers, 
there also are sharply clashing opinions about its merits among labor leaders, 
occupational medicine specialists and legal ethics professors. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFL-CIO, the National Consumer League and the Pennsylvania attorney 
general have endorsed the agreement. But it has been sharply criticized by 
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, most of the asbestos victims organizations and 
Paul Brodeur, author of "Outrageous Misconduct," a 1985 book that chronicled 
how asbestos industry executives concealed for more than 40 years information 
about the dangers workers faced in toiling with the so-called magic mineral, 
renowned for its heat resistant qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the Philadelphia settlement is a provision that individuals 
participating in it will be precluded, other than in exceptional cases, from 
suing the 20 manufacturers, who are attempting to cap their liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, private medical panels would screen the damage claims of workers and 
their families. The agreement calls for 100,000 claims to be paid out during 
the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount paid for approved claims would vary from a range of $5,800 to 
$7,500 for non-malignant medical conditions to a range of $37,000-$60,000 for 
mesothelioma. Under certain circumstances, a very limited number of victims may 
apply for more compensation than the stated limits. 
</P>
<P>
 People opting out can continue to sue. Court officials could not say how many 
have filed papers to do so, but Baron said close to 10,000 people contacted by 
his firm alone had opted out. Oakland attorney Steven Kazan, another leading 
plaintiffs' lawyer, said more than 5,000 Northern Californians had opted out 
after being advised to do so by his firm and labor groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazan said Californians had strong reasons to opt out because state statutes 
enable particularly sick asbestos victims to get to trial faster than in other 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he filed a brief saying that Californians, on average, receive more 
than twice as much for typical mesothelioma claims than the settlement calls 
for. "Based on historical compensation levels in California for mesothelioma 
claims, the CCR settlement will not adequately compensate" Californians who get 
this invariably fatal disease. About 12% of all mesothelioma claims nationwide 
originate in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Steinberg, one of the leading asbestos lawyers in Los Angeles, also 
said he had advised many of his clients to opt out, even though he is taking no 
formal position on the merits of the settlement. "We opted out certain people 
we felt would not do as well under the proposal as they would in the tort 
system," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the huge sums of money and large numbers of litigants, the 20 
companies constitute fewer than half of the former asbestos firms involved in 
personal injury suits. Dozens of other companies are likely to be affected by 
the settlement and one of them, Owens-Illinois Inc., is formally opposing it. 
The firm contends that it might be subject to increased liability if the 
settlement is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 But the consortium maintains that it is a fair deal. The settlement "reflects 
a hard-fought compromise . . . and provides for the first time in this 
litigation, a promise of rational resolution for asbestos claims," said John D. 
Aldock, attorney for the 20 companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Motley said the deal is a creative alternative to the current legal system 
where delays of five to 10 years between filing and trial are not unusual. 
Indeed, many people with debilitating lung diseases die lingering, painful 
deaths before they get their day in court, he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Motley said, the new system would reduce costs "so that the 
insurance and other assets of the defendants are not dissipated and squandered 
but rather are available to pay claimants." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies by the RAND Corp. show that about 65% of the money spent by companies 
in asbestos litigation has gone to lawyers on both sides. Moreover, 18 
companies seeking to reduce their liability have declared bankruptcy, 
temporarily halting all the asbestos lawsuits that had been brought against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 An AFL-CIO brief supporting the settlement said that the growing number of 
bankruptcies among asbestos companies "has thrown the compensation of future 
victims into doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Motley said the sickest people would be compensated more rapidly under the new 
system -- "six months, not six years." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain that the proposed settlement would provide no compensation to 
claimants with non-malignant conditions, such as lung thickening. 
</P>
<P>
 But Motley said those people often receive fairly modest awards now, and waive 
their rights to sue later if they develop a more serious disease. He stressed 
that, under the settlement, they would be allowed to seek more money if they 
grow sicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the settlement has fundamental flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Wages, president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union, said it 
is patently unfair to bar people, some of whom may be unaware they were exposed 
to asbestos, from their constitutional right to a future jury trial just 
because they failed to opt out of a class-action lawsuit they may never have 
heard of. He predicted that thousands of workers would "not even hear about the 
settlement until they try to assert claims and discover it is too late to opt 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, it takes 15 to 35 years after initial exposure for asbestos-related 
diseases to appear. Authoritative studies estimate that in Los Angeles County 
about 970 people a year die from these diseases, which also include lung cancer 
and asbestosis, a severe scarring of the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents also say that many victims will not be rapidly compensated 
because the settlement sets yearly limits on the awards -- starting at 15,100 
the first year and diminishing to 5,855 in the 10th year -- that are 
unrealistically low given the number of valid claims likely to be filed. About 
50 new asbestos lawsuits are filed daily in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, opponents contend that the settlement would deny monetary 
benefits to 40% of those who have historically received such benefits, without 
providing any adequate substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, people who have developed non-malignant lung thickening known 
as "pleural plaques" would be ineligible for compensation, even though 
thousands of people with this condition have received damages in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thus . . . a claimant who has endured a lifetime with the knowledge that he 
has a diagnosed asbestos-related condition, and has legitimately incurred 
expenses for medical monitoring of his condition, but whose disease has not 
progressed to the point that it fits the criteria, will never receive any 
compensation," Baron said. "The unfairness to such claimants, many of whom may 
be elderly or infirm, cannot be overstated." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time that the pleural plaque component of the deal was being 
negotiated, Motley and his co-counsel Locks were negotiating thousands of 
settlements for their clients with the condition, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the consortium of companies settled more than 10,000 cases with 
Motley's firm for $138 million and nearly 4,000 with Locks' firm for $77 
million, according to court documents. Typically, the lawyers receive one third 
of the settlement, meaning legal fees of about $71 million for the two firms on 
those cases. (Motley's firm often works with other law firms, which would share 
in the fees.) 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, during negotiations on the settlement, Motley's partner Joseph Rice 
sent a letter to other plaintiffs' lawyers suggesting that they settle their 
pending cases before the class action for future victims was filed so that they 
could take advantage of more favorable terms. As a consequence, CCR companies 
settled about 100,000 additional cases before Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the height of cynicism," said Bryan Wolfman, a lawyer for Nader's 
Public Citizen organization, which is challenging the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics experts are divided on the fairness of the deal and on the propriety of 
the role played by Locks and Motley, who also stand to make considerably more 
money in their role as counsel for the class of future victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The rights of future victims were unfairly sacrificed to the interests of the 
current clients of Locks and Motley, according to Cornell University law 
professor Roger C. Cramton and Boston University law professor Susan Koniak, 
paid expert witnesses for attorneys Baron and Henderson, who are challenging 
the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 A report they wrote said Locks and Motley are "burdened by impermissible 
conflicts of interest" in attempting to balance the interests of their current 
clients with those of potential future claimants, on whose behalf the 
settlement was negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching the same conclusion was Columbia University law professor John C. 
Coffee Jr., who is scheduled to testify as an expert witness for those 
objecting to the settlement but has declined to take any money. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other side has ethics experts, too. One of them, Yale University law 
professor Geoffrey C. Hazard (who co-authored an ethics textbook with Cramton 
and Koniak, and, like them, is being paid for his expertise) found there was no 
"impermissible conflict of interest" because there was not a fixed sum of money 
the current clients and future claimants were competing for. 
</P>
<P>
 Another paid expert, Samuel Dash, former Senate Watergate committee special 
counsel who is now a law professor at Georgetown University, filed a 
declaration saying the settlement was consummated in an aboveboard fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Locks and Motley's negotiation of the settlement "constituted professionally 
proper and zealous representation" of the future victims, Dash said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Locks and Motley strenuously deny that they did anything 
wrong. They both branded their critics as "ivory tower academics" unfamiliar 
with the real world of trial law. 
</P>
<P>
 "My conscience is clear," said Motley, who added that he is particularly 
anxious to cross-examine Koniak during the hearing. "She doesn't know asbestos 
from aspirin," he declared in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key issue in the case is whether potential claimants were given 
adequate notice of the class action and how they would be affected by it. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 400,000 packets describing the settlement, including an "opt 
out" form, were sent to potential victims, according to Lawrence Fitzpatrick, 
CCR's president. But no one knows for sure how many victims there may be, 
although Aldock acknowledged that it could be "in the millions." There also was 
television and newspaper advertising during November and December about the 
proposal and an 800-number phone line was set up to handle questions. 
</P>
<P>
 That, too, precipitated controversy. Baron and some other attorneys who are 
challenging the settlement surreptitiously taped some telephone conversations 
of employees giving out incorrect information on the 800 line. The attorneys 
hoped to discredit the process and persuade U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed to 
extend the time for potential claimants to opt out. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed turned down Baron's request. Moreover, Motley charged that Baron had 
broken the law by taping the phone calls. Earlier, Motley angrily asserted that 
Baron was putting out misleading written material in an effort to get more 
people to opt out of the settlement. Baron denied doing anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the thousands of people who have opted out is Myles O'Malley, executive 
director of the White Lung Association of New Jersey, an asbestos victims 
organization. O'Malley, 50, said he was exposed to asbestos for 12 years as a 
carpenter in New Orleans and Brooklyn, working on large-scale projects such as 
the building of the Louisiana Superdome, the refurbishing of oil processing 
vessels and renovation and demolition of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said he suffers from shortness of breath and tightness in his chest, 
and medical examinations indicate that he has chronic obstructive lung disease. 
"Since I do not smoke, I attribute these conditions to my exposure to 
asbestos," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The settlement stinks," O'Malley said. "It is the most recent in a long list 
of attempts to deny victims their day in court." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is expected to last two to three weeks. Thus far, Judge Reed has 
rejected numerous motions attempting to derail the settlement, including 
contentions that people who have not yet become sick are being forced to 
surrender their right to a day in court if they become ill. Both sides say they 
expect whatever decision he makes will be appealed and the case may wind up in 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 One likely issue on appeal is the rights of future claimants, legal experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very hot open question," said UCLA law professor Carrie Menkel-Meadow. 
"Some of the law may get made in this case. You have a clash between efficiency 
and mass justice on the one hand and individual justice and due process on the 
other. It's about as tricky a balancing act as any court will face." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little legal precedent on the issue; one case, pending before the 
U.S. Supreme Court, challenges whether a New York court had the right to bar 
future suits by absent claimants when it settled a class-action brought by 
victims of the Vietnam-era defoliant Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed asbestos settlement raises serious questions about "the limits of 
judicial power," said Cornell professor Cramton. He said that judges may be 
venturing into legislative territory if they seek to limit future litigants' 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah R. Hensler, director of RAND's Institute for Civil Justice, who has 
studied asbestos litigation in detail and written critically about how the 
judicial system has coped with it, said the Philadelphia case is very 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This litigation raises a whole host of question about protecting the 
plaintiffs' interests. . . . It's very important not to lose sight of the 
fundamental problems, " Hensler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legal system is designed for individual dispute resolution. No one has 
figured out how to mold the system to deal fairly with these kinds of mass 
cases." BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos was first used in making pottery in Finland 4,500 years ago and, 
during its 20th Century heyday, had uses ranging from electrical insulation to 
brake linings. Warning labels were first placed on asbestos materials in 1964 
after studies showed vastly higher rates of lung cancer and other lung diseases 
in people who had worked with asbestos than in the general population. Further 
studies revealed that people exposed to the mineral for only a month or two 
have developed asbestos-related diseases. Victims included women whose sole 
exposure came from washing their husbands' asbestos-laden clothes. The first 
legal claim for damages by an asbestos worker in this country was lodged in 
1927, but suits began to be filed in large numbers only in the 1970s. The first 
major precedent came in 1973, when a federal appeals court upheld a $79,000 
jury verdict to an insulation worker who had mesothelioma, ruling that the 
danger to workers had been foreseeable to manufacturers, who also had a duty to 
put warning labels on their products. In 1975, the U.S. government banned the 
use of asbestos in molded insulation. It was banned for most other uses in this 
country by the end of the decade. In 1978, plaintiffs' lawyers discovered a 
cache of documents from the 1930s and 1940s revealing that the asbestos 
industry had suppressed scientific data that would have warned asbestos workers 
of dangers they faced in handling the material. That revelation and some other 
court decisions opened the floodgates of litigation. Companies in Controversy

ASTEROIDS, ICE KEYS TO NEW LIFE THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All life on Earth may owe its origin to fire and ice, as a rain of immense 
meteorites shattered the thick ice sheathing a primordial ocean more than 4 
billion years ago, according to a new theory presented by scientists Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sharp departure from the conventional scientific view of how life began, 
several leading authorities told the American Assn. for the Advancement of 
Science that such cataclysmic impacts may have intermittently melted frozen 
oceans and triggered in their depths a cascade of chemical reactions that 
spontaneously created the elemental building blocks of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Redolent with religious and philosophical implications, the origin of life is 
the fundamental mystery of organic chemistry. By what process were the 
molecules that led to living things first assembled? 
</P>
<P>
 The new theory was developed by Jeffrey Bada, a respected authority on marine 
chemistry at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Stanley Miller, the 
UC San Diego chemistry expert who first demonstrated in the laboratory how all 
the elements needed for life could spontaneously combine to create the amino 
acids, simple sugars and DNA bases that are necessary for life. 
</P>
<P>
 To frame their theories about the beginning of life, scientists only have the 
rules of chemistry and informed speculation about the state of the early Earth. 
There are no fossils or direct geological or astronomical evidence to guide 
them as they try to understand chemical reactions that took place when the 
Earth was barren and the sun was a fainter, cooler star. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists have suggested that primeval lightning may have sparked the 
crucial chain reaction in an atmosphere rich in ammonia and methane -- just 
like the famous experiment Miller carried out in 1953, but on a planetary 
scale. Other experts have proposed that comets or cosmic dust might have 
carried the seeds of life to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others argue that the sun was so faint in its youth that the Earth must 
have been a frozen ball -- unless it was warmed by a "greenhouse" atmosphere 
rich in carbon dioxide. That, however, would have smothered any organic 
chemical reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The new theory is an effort to reconcile those contradictions, along with the 
requirements of organic chemistry and what planetary scientists have determined 
about the violent conditions on primitive Earth 4 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a plausible explanation of how, under a devastating celestial 
bombardment, life began over and over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence that the origin of life took place only once. The origin 
of life may have taken place several times, and several times it may have been 
annihilated by impacts," said Bada, who presented the new theory Sunday at the 
annual conference of the nation's oldest and largest organization of 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation drew a packed auditorium of planetary scientists and chemists 
in large part because of Miller's stature as a leader of such theorizing for 
four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Bada and Miller believe that the organic molecules that serve as seeds of life 
arose at the bottom of ancient oceans crusted with ice 1,000 feet thick. At 
that time, the sun was so faint that the temperature at Earth's surface never 
rose higher than 40 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, according to planetary 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The ice would have served as a blanket to keep most of the ocean warm and 
fluid. Scientists believe those ancient oceans could have been more than two 
miles deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a very frozen planet. Most of the ocean was still unfrozen," Bada 
said. "And this is where I think you could have some pretty interesting organic 
chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 Battered by the fiery impacts of asteroids greater than 50 miles in diameter, 
the ice would have thawed and refrozen repeatedly, perhaps as often as every 
100,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Impacts could periodically melt this frozen planet," Bada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new theory, any organic material would have been trapped beneath the 
ice when the oceans refroze, preventing the raw material for organic molecules 
from being destroyed in the atmosphere. Thus -- in that rich, protected stew -- 
the first self-replicating molecules could have come into being, Miller and 
Bada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent impacts could have easily annihilated those precursors to life, the 
scientists suggested, just as a large meteor impact is widely believed to have 
caused the demise of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Earth's surface was being traumatized by impacts," said David Stevenson, 
a professor of planetary sciences at Caltech. "Along would come an impact and 
blast the hell out of an area and destroy early life. Life may have started 
several times over. 
</P>
<P>
 "So perhaps we should ask not when life began, but when did life persist?" he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson, like Miller and Bada, said he was skeptical of the theory that 
comets or meteorites might have seeded Earth with the building blocks of life. 
Although it is well-known that meteorites and cosmic dust can contain some 
amino acids, there is no evidence that enough survived impact to fertilize the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to find traces of extraterrestrial amino acids in Antarctica and 
Greenland, where they might have been preserved in pristine ice, turned up only 
one sample that shows any trace of organic compounds from outer space. That 
trace, from ice that formed more than 4,000 years ago, is so faint that 
scientists believe it is proof that "cosmic rain" could not have served as the 
source for the chemical reactions that led to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amounts are pitifully small," Bada said. "It is a pretty dilute soup to 
do any kind of organic chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 However the process was triggered, life on Earth began in "a geological 
instant," the scientists said Sunday. But their notion of an instant does not 
quite match that of most people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been adding up the time it might take for life to develop," Miller 
said. "The whole process could take place in 10 million years or less."

BRASH MOTOROLA NO STRANGER TO BATTLES IN JAPAN ARENA; TRADE: THANKS TO 
COMPETITION, IT TRANSFORMED ITSELF. QUESTION NOW IS WILL THE FIRM HELP TOKYO DO 
LIKEWISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It started with pagers. Motorola invented them and by 1978 was the worldwide 
leader -- except in Japan, where the Nippon Telegraph & Telephone monopoly 
refused to buy from anybody outside a cozy circle of Japanese companies such as 
NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 So Motorola launched what turned into a protracted siege. It borrowed the 
battering ram of the U.S. government to weaken Japanese resolve, and after 
tortuous negotiations and the personal intervention of then-Secretary of State 
George P. Shultz, NTT agreed to let foreign suppliers bid on its business. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was just the beginning. New pagers had to be designed and built to 
NTT's arcane specifications and stringent quality standards. Undeterred, 
Motorola built a new American factory line and a special testing facility in 
Japan. Defect levels in its pagers fell nearly to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to take away any excuse for why American companies can't be 
successful in Japan," says Arnold Brenner, Motorola's executive vice president 
in charge of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola finally managed to capture a large part of the pager market in Japan. 
Yet despite 16 years of effort and a remarkable record of success practically 
everywhere else, the company continues to face barriers at every turn in 
Japan's cellular telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
 Such problems have led to a clash between the world's two biggest economies 
over a balance of payments more lopsided in Japan's favor than ever before. 
Should a trade war erupt between Washington and Tokyo, the spark in the powder 
keg may very well be Motorola, whose struggle culminated last week in President 
Clinton's announcement that he would level sanctions against Japan for reneging 
on promises to give Motorola full access to its cellular-telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
 But Motorola isn't just a catalyst. More than most companies, it has 
experienced the full range of the Japanese economic miracle. Thanks to Japanese 
competition, Motorola has transformed itself. The question now is whether, 
thanks to Motorola and its influence in Washington, Japan will do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 For Motorola, the transformation was mostly positive. Driven from the 
television manufacturing business, Motorola remade itself as a cutting-edge 
technology company and bounced back to challenge Japan Inc. in one of its 
greatest strongholds -- microelectronics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japanese companies like NEC and Fujitsu continue to make inroads into 
the U.S. market in such key sectors as cellular phones, Motorola remains the 
industry leader. It also excels in computer chips. Last year its earnings 
doubled to $1 billion from the year before, while sales climbed 25% to $16.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Motorola has beaten a path into the Japanese market, it is a narrow 
path not many can follow. Few U.S. companies have the combination of 
technological leadership, financial muscle and diplomatic clout Motorola has. 
The company hires experts on Japan, including former U.S. trade officials, to 
advise it, and the official in the U.S. trade representative's office most 
knowledgeable about Japan is a former Motorola executive. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of all this, Motorola remains hobbled in Japan. Yet Motorola also 
knows that it can't give up. Company executives say that unless American 
companies fight to build positions in the Japanese market, they will eventually 
face trouble at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola was one of the first American companies to recognize this. In 1978, 
Bob Galvin, then Motorola's chief executive, led the company's senior 
executives on a retreat to assess the company's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't look good. Japan's blitzkrieg attack on U.S. television markets 
in the late 1960s and early 1970s had so devastated the market that Motorola 
had been forced to sell its last defect-plagued television factory to rival 
Matsushita in 1974. Motorola's CB radio business was also demolished by 
Japanese competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola responded by moving up into such high-tech sectors as semiconductors, 
computers and telecommunications. But the Japanese government had targeted the 
same businesses, and Japan was already pushing American semiconductor firms out 
of the important computer-memory market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Motorola executives returned from the retreat with a clear goal: Stop 
Japan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be no more short-term thinking. Investments that would help win 
market share in Japan would no longer have to meet the return-on-investment 
criteria required for investments elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that if we allowed Japan to maintain the sanctuary (of its 
domestic market), they would be able to generate profits at home to put us out 
of business," says Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy paid off in spades. As a result of pursuing Japan's pager market, 
for example, Motorola learned that its quality wasn't what it thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought their defect levels were world class," says David Yoffie, who 
wrote a case study on Motorola for Harvard Business School. "They discovered 
Japanese defect levels were lower than they ever thought necessary or even 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 To catch up, Motorola launched a corporate-wide quality improvement program. 
Today Motorola is the leader in Japan in pager sales. Its extensive presence in 
Japan helped win the customer trust needed to put Motorola microprocessors at 
the heart of such Japanese products as Sony Camcorders and Canon cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola also strived to shore up its defenses. In the early 1980s, it moved 
aggressively to file dumping charges against imports of Japanese pagers and 
cellular phones. The moves resulted in duties of up to 106% on products from 
Japanese companies such as Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola went to work on public opinion, too. In controversial ads, it boasted 
of its improved quality and complained about unfair Japanese trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "They recaptured the old 'What's good for General Motors is good for America' 
feeling," says Michael Borrus, a researcher at the Berkeley Roundtable on the 
International Economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The most grueling confrontation has been over Motorola's efforts to get a fair 
share of the market for cellular phones, an area where Japan has already made 
major inroads in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 The first barriers in the early 1980s were testing and certification standards 
that were designed to favor Japanese products already on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1986, after years of pressure, Motorola's cellular standard, which 
conformed to systems used in the West, was approved. Coincidentally, the 
Japanese government chose to allow competition in the cellular market -- 
competition Japanese style. 
</P>
<P>
 When Motorola joined with a Japanese partner to offer alternate cellular 
services, it was only allowed to install its system in western Japan, which 
represents about 40% of the Japanese population. NTT's system would operate 
throughout Japan. And a new carrier called IDO, made up of such well-connected 
corporations as Toyota Motors and NEC, was given a license to operate in the 
rest of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were even less fair than they appeared. Since IDO adopted the NTT 
system (built by NEC), its cellular phones could now be used anywhere in the 
nation. Motorola's phones could not even be used in such key centers of 
business as Tokyo and Nagoya. 
</P>
<P>
 Again Motorola complained. Through the intervention of the U.S. government, 
the company won in 1987 the right to expand its territory. Still, the company 
could not offer its services in the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor. The Ministry of Post 
and Telecommunications (MPT) insisted there was not enough radio bandwidth for 
an additional system. 
</P>
<P>
 The following year, however, when the MPT quietly offered frequencies to a 
well-connected Japanese firm to offer cellular services on taxis, Motorola 
shouted foul. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Motorola filed an official complaint, taking advantage of the new 
1988 Omnibus Trade bill. That bill authorized the U.S. trade representative to 
retaliate against partners with persistent unfair trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Time was of the essence. Motorola has just introduced the MicroTac, a cellular 
phone smaller and a third lighter than any Japanese product available. It was a 
rare competitive advantage and Motorola wanted to move while it still held the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Motorola's complaint, the U.S. trade representative cited Japan 
in 1989 for limiting U.S. entry into Japanese markets. Duties of 100% could be 
applied on Japanese telecommunications equipment if negotiations failed to 
resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan finally caved during last-minute negotiations in a Washington, D.C., 
hotel room between Japanese power broker Ichiro Ozawa and freshman U.S. trade 
representatives consulting repeatedly over the phone with Motorola executives 
on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 IDO reluctantly accepted the compromise. But then the company dragged its feet 
when it came to implementation. The Japanese Postal Ministry, which had forced 
the compromise on IDO, told complaining Motorola officials that it was now a 
strictly private issue and the ministry could do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 By last year, IDO still hadn't built enough transmitters to cover even half of 
the Tokyo region. Few customers wanted to buy phones that could only be used in 
parts of the city. Consequently, while the Motorola joint venture in western 
Japan had a 50% share of the market, in Tokyo, Motorola's share was a skimpy 
1%. After months more of frustrating negotiations the U.S. Trade representative 
just last week set a Feb. 15 deadline for IDO to offer an acceptable plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline passed. Coincidentally, it was the day after Clinton's failed 
summit meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa. Clinton used the 
opportunity to send Japan a message by threatening sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Motorola says it is losing both time and money. From April this 
year, Japan will allow cellular phone makers to sell their products directly 
through retail stores instead of from carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in April there will be a tremendous rush to purchase cellular 
phones," says Brenner. Since Motorola covers only a small portion of Tokyo, "We 
will lose much of that initial thrust. Once a subscriber chooses a system it is 
twice as expensive to get him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola is demanding that IDO make the necessary investments to cover the 
Tokyo area within a year instead of the three years it plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola's decision to put itself once again in the middle of a potential 
trade war was not an easy one. Last year, Motorola's sales in Japan totaled 
close to $1 billion. Many American companies would have chosen not to risk its 
relationships in Japan by becoming the center of a trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always the risk of a backlash," says Brenner. "This is not the 
Japanese way." 
</P>
<P>
 But the upside is also great. Brenner figures the company's sales in Japan 
would be 250% higher if Motorola's share of the Japanese market was as high as 
its share of other overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. companies "are willing to accept the scraps," says Brenner. "When 
the market is this big, the scraps are juicy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Motorola's brash, in-your-face trade policies have won it respect, if not 
universal admiration. "In Japan, cowards die many times over while the valiant 
get respect," says John Stern, head of the American Electronic Industry Assn.'s 
Asia office in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens in this latest confrontation, says Stern, Motorola has 
established itself as a company that can't be pushed around. Said Stern: 
"Motorola has become someone who has to be included when decisions are made."

TOLL OF VIOLENCE HAUNTS FAMILIES OF POLICE OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE and MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On those mornings at dawn when Francine Spada would run the woodsy hills of 
Elysian Park in training to become a Los Angeles police officer, her husband 
and daughter would follow her in the family car just to make sure she was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 11 years ago; if only it were that easy to keep her safe today. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Philip Spada who persuaded his wife to join the LAPD, but now -- even 
though she has risen to become the only woman sergeant in the Foothill Division 
-- he is not sure he would recommend the same course. Not in a country where a 
record 80,000 officers were assaulted in the line of duty in 1992. Not in a 
metropolitan area where seven cops have been killed in the past year, with 
countless others attacked and fired upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Police work has always been a dangerous game, but the rate of deaths in 
greater Los Angeles in the past year is dizzying: Two police officers in 
Compton shot to death after a traffic stop in February, 1993. A Garden Grove 
officer killed during a traffic stop two weeks later. An Oxnard officer shot to 
death last December in pursuit of a gunman who had killed three people. A 
Manhattan Beach officer shot to death in the presence of his 13-year-old nephew 
that same month. Then, on Valentine's Day, two Palos Verdes Estates police 
officers gunned down while attending -- what could seem safer? -- a 
motivational seminar at a Torrance hotel conference room filled with cops in 
street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 And Saturday night, a Culver City officer was shot in the neck by an armed 
robbery suspect he was chasing. He was in stable condition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 If all of this has been daunting for those who go to work on the streets every 
day, it has also been terrifying for the officers' families. A husband wakes at 
2 a.m., alone in bed, and spends the next minutes wondering and listening for 
the click of a key in the door. A wife channels her anxiety into a batch of 
chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. A 6-year-old informs her mother 
matter-of-factly: "I want you to know I prayed in school today that you would 
not keel over at work." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so frightening to families because the violence is coming out of 
routine kinds of work . . . not the dangerous kinds of assignments where you 
can anticipate some problems," said Audrey Honig, director of psychological 
services for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Many families had come to expect an occasional casualty in a high-risk hostage 
situation or warrant search, but they were hardly prepared for the level to 
which this crime-ridden society has sunk. Law enforcement officers have been 
shot at while eating dinner in their squad cars. They have been shot at while 
making innocuous notations in their log books. They have been shot at in 
communities once thought safe -- Martin Ganz, 29, was the first Manhattan Beach 
police officer killed in the line of duty; the shooting deaths of Palos Verdes 
Estates Capt. Michael Tracy and Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool were the first in 
that department's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "These officers are off the streets, at a meeting, at a place that is supposed 
to be safe," Kris Mohandie, an LAPD psychologist, said of the morning when 
David Fukuto, the son of a prominent state court justice, stormed into the 
Holiday Inn meeting room with a pair of handguns and, according to authorities, 
started firing. "That's pretty heavy stuff. It sends a message to the families 
that the violence could happen anywhere, any time . . . that no place is safe 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of violent assaults against law enforcement officers has risen 
steadily in the last 15 years. In 1977 -- the first year the FBI began 
compiling such statistics -- about 49,000 officers nationwide were assaulted, 
primarily with guns or knives. By 1992, the number had soared to 80,000, 
according to the most recent FBI figures available. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of officers killed -- an average of 60 to 70 a year since the late 
1980s -- would have broken records, too, if not for the advent of bulletproof 
vests, police experts say; about 400 officers have survived shootings over the 
last decade because they were wearing protective armor. 
</P>
<P>
 After Inglewood Police Sgt. Donald Fry survived a shooting last year, his 
sister begged him to retire. He had been sitting in his squad car, its engine 
running, making an entry in his log book, when a stranger appeared out of the 
darkness, stuck a semiautomatic pistol through the window and shot him in the 
chest. When paramedics stripped away the vest that saved Fry's life, they found 
a gaping bullet hole in his uniform shirt, just inches from his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The night he was shot, Fry was wearing a black armband in honor of the 
officers who had been killed six days earlier in Compton. Before Fry had fully 
recovered, Manhattan Beach Officer Ganz was killed and Pomona Officer Roger 
Mathews was shot and wounded while searching a home for a robbery suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Fry, a 51-year-old widower and 27-year veteran, eventually returned to work, 
partly for financial reasons. "But it's more than that," he said. "This is what 
I do best. It's the only thing I know . . . I guess it's just a part of me." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of devotion to police work was lost on his family. A bullet inches 
from the heart was more than they could bear. They wanted him to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm his big sister . . . . I'm afraid for his life," Mildred Ott said. "I've 
told him a number of times, 'Don't push your luck. Get out while you can.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever an officer comes home with a black band on the badge -- a gesture of 
honor to a colleague killed in the line of duty -- families can become 
unnerved. And the large number of high-profile killings involving Southern 
California officers in a single year has pushed family members to new levels of 
anxiety, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tracy was killed in the Torrance hotel, Candice Weber -- his cousin and 
an 11-year LAPD reserve patrol officer -- received a hysterical phone call. It 
was her mother, first informing her of the death, then begging her to give up 
all connections with police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'I want you to stop that immediately . . . . Honey, can't you stop 
that please?' " Weber said, her own voice breaking. "She was crying 
hysterically." 
</P>
<P>
 When a comrade is killed, law enforcement officers take solace in peer 
support. They practice safety strategies and review tactics for backing each 
other up. But family members are isolated from all that, experts note, left to 
say goodby in the morning and wonder whether it is for the last time, expected 
to sit helplessly by and imagine the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 They deal with the strain in creative ways. Sgt. Spada and her husband have 
designed a beeper code system; she beeps in the code at any hour of the day or 
night and lets him know she is all right. 
</P>
<P>
 Some put a foot down where they can. Eagle Rock hairdresser Diana Brown, 
married for nine years to LAPD veteran Sgt. Steve Brown, says she can handle 
the prospect of his returning to street duty after three years behind the 
safety of a desk, but she insists he wear a vest. "Over my dead body will he go 
without one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shellie Reiners and Tiffany Stephenson, married to Simi Valley Police 
Department Special Enforcement Detail officers, run the same drill in the 
mornings as their husbands leave their condominium complex for work. They kiss 
them goodby and suppress thoughts of the worst with a mantra of sorts: He's 
trained to handle himself. He wears a bulletproof vest. You can't drive 
yourself crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a shooting hurls the thoughts forward again. When Reiners watched the 
televised funeral of Oxnard Officer James E. O'Brien -- shot to death Dec. 2 
while chasing an unemployed computer engineer who had killed three people -- 
she imagined herself sitting in black at her dead husband's graveside, 
accepting the folded flag from his casket. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't that difficult for her to envision. Fresh out of the academy, the 
week the couple were to marry, Craig Reiners and another officer fatally shot a 
gunman involved in a domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "That woke her up to the reality that there's a good possibility I'd get 
involved in a situation that could be life-threatening," said the 25-year-old 
Reiners, 2 1/2 years of police work now under his belt. "Before I leave for 
work, we always make sure we're not fighting or arguing, and we always leave on 
good terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Many family members seem torn about how to express their anxieties. Some are 
like Diana Brown, who believes it's her duty to make sure in times of crisis 
that her husband is fed and rested. During the Northridge earthquake's 
aftermath, when officers were working round-the-clock shifts, she fixed his 
lunch and left notes all over the house reminding him to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other family members become demanding, insisting that spouses check in all the 
time and prodding them as they leave the house, "Got your vest on? Got your 
vest on?" 
</P>
<P>
 "All they have is this fantasy of what can happen at work," LAPD's Mohandie 
said. "These fantasies can run rampant . . . and create a clinging behavior 
that causes real tension in a relationship. In extreme cases, the spouse will 
push the officer to find another line of work." 
</P>
<P>
 The level of violence against officers has led to more alcoholism, more 
suicides, more broken homes. More law enforcement couples require counseling 
today than ever before, said Suzie Sawyer, executive director of Concerns of 
Police Survivors (COPS), a national support group for law enforcement families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality of the first line-of-duty death really smacks you in the face. 
Your first response is to get him off the streets, get him to quit," Sawyer 
said, recalling the days when her husband was a rookie in Hyattsville, Md., and 
she was at home with an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a news report of an officer shot in Hyattsville and that's all I 
knew," she remembered. "It was like my blood turned to ice. I took my baby from 
the crib and sat in front of the TV praying and cursing at the same time. 
Praying he was OK; cursing that he became a cop." 
</P>
<P>
 Old habits linger. It has been a year since Lt. Ray Welch, 42, left the 
streets for an administrative job as head of the Anaheim Police Department's 
traffic bureau. Nevertheless, it was his wife's first reflex to call him 
Wednesday afternoon when she heard that a Santa Ana officer had been shot and 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The nightmarish thoughts never go away, most family members confess. Success 
is keeping the lid on them. 
</P>
<P>
 At Francine Spada's Glendale home, where she is sleeping off another long 
night shift, her daughters awaken her by taking a seat on the edge of the bed. 
Despite their parents' efforts to shield them from the horrors of police work, 
the children know that two officers have died in a storm of gunfire in a 
Torrance hotel. They know it could have been their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandra, 15, shines her mother's heavy black patrol shoes and offers to make 
her a salad to take to work. Katherine, 6, spends more time than usual on the 
bed. Their father, a reserve officer for 20 years with a love of police work as 
deep as that of his patrol-sergeant wife, recites his litany of instructions 
before she goes out again: Be careful out there. Don't get into any situations 
you can't handle. Be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't dwell on it," Philip Spada says later. "I wake up sometimes at 2 
a.m. and she isn't home yet and I wonder. But then I turn on the TV for a few 
minutes and I remind myself, if something had happened I would have heard. I 
remind myself that I have a job to go to in the morning and I better get some 
sleep. And I turn the TV off." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the spousal strength, the career devotion, the refusal to succumb to 
fear, fall away for a moment. For him -- the guy who encouraged her to join, 
the guy who wants as much as she does to see her make lieutenant -- it keeps 
coming back to this: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm selfish. I don't want anything to affect all the great things we've got. 
Our relationship. The kids. The family life," he pauses. "I don't know what the 
hell we'd do without her."

AZT FOUND TO PROTECT FETUSES FROM AIDS; MEDICINE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED STUDY 
SAYS DRUG SHARPLY REDUCES TRANSMISSION OF VIRUS FROM MOTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The results of a federally sponsored study testing the AIDS drug AZT in 
infected pregnant women have shown that the drug has a dramatic effect in 
preventing transmission of the virus to the fetus, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, which are scheduled to be released by the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases today, are so significant that a special 
monitoring board -- which has been examining the study on an ongoing basis -- 
met late last week and immediately recommended that the placebo arm of the 
study be stopped and that all pregnant women remaining in the trial be given 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, meaning that 
one group of women had been receiving a medically worthless placebo for 
comparison purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The NIAID, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, took the 
unusual step of releasing the data so that physicians across the nation would 
be aware of the results. 
</P>
<P>
 But it stopped short of recommending that doctors treating pregnant infected 
women automatically prescribe the drug because its long-term effects on young 
children are still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data are very encouraging, but we still want to make sure there are no 
long-term toxicities," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID. "We don't 
see any indication of that, but we will only know that from long-term 
follow-up. With regard to just the efficacy, it seems to be pretty compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these are important data that physicians and health care providers 
and patients should be aware of in order to make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Several thousand children have contracted AIDS since the epidemic began in 
1981, and approximately 10,000 or more children are believed to be infected 
with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes the deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the epidemic, a small number of infections among children were the 
result of blood transfusions and contaminated blood products for treating 
hemophilia. But the vast majority of infections occur when an infected woman 
transmits the virus to her fetus during pregnancy or delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact mechanism of transmission is unknown, but infected women have a 25% 
or greater chance of passing the virus on to the unborn children, studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 In this study, which began in April, 1991, data was obtained for 364 babies 
who were born to infected women. Of these, 53 babies were infected. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those 53 infants, only 13 were born to mothers treated with AZT, while the 
remaining 40 were born to mothers given placebos. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all babies whose mothers received AZT, only 8.3% were infected, but 
25.5% of babies born to mothers who received the placebo were infected. 
</P>
<P>
 Fauci said the only short-term problem found in the group of babies treated 
with the drug was mild, reversible anemia. The health of the babies has been 
followed for at least 18 months, in part to accurately determine whether they 
carried a true infection. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to accurately determine whether a child is infected with the 
AIDS virus until he or she reaches the age of about 15 months. Until then, 
children typically carry antibodies passed on from their mothers -- rather than 
their own -- so testing is often imprecise. 
</P>
<P>
 The study originally was slated to include 740 HIV-infected women, but it was 
stopped before full enrollment was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The women were randomized into two groups, an AZT group and a placebo-control 
group. Women between 14 weeks and 34 weeks of pregnancy received the drug or a 
placebo orally. The drug or a placebo was administered intravenously during 
labor. After birth, the infants were also given AZT or a placebo orally for 
their first six weeks of life. 
</P>
<P>
 For the women, treatment with the drug began no earlier than 14 weeks of 
pregnancy in order to protect the fetus from potential damage. By that time, 
key organs are already formed and are considered less vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The study took place at 59 facilities in the United States and nine in France, 
including 35 financially supported by the NIAID and 15 supported by the 
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, also a part of the 
NIH. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan DeLaurentis, a co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Pediatric AIDS 
Foundation, said she welcomed the study results but that she hopes research 
will continue into other ways to prevent transmission from mother to fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still interested in how transmission occurs to begin with, so we can 
find ways to block all transmission from all infected women," she said. "But 
this is certainly encouraging news." 
</P>
<P>
 AZT, which is manufactured by Burroughs Wellcome Co. of Research Triangle 
Park, N.C., is one of a class of AIDS drugs that attack the underlying viral 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also been shown to be effective in improving the quality of life for 
patients with fully developed AIDS, and to delay the onset of AIDS in infected 
individuals who have not yet experienced symptoms of disease. It was approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.

COLUMN ONE; AN ARMY OF PARENT PEDDLERS; RAISING FUNDS FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S 
CAUSES, MOMS AND DADS SELL EVERYTHING FROM COOKIES TO PIZZAS TO GIFT WRAP. SUCH 
MONEYMAKERS BRING IN $1 BILLION A YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Oranges, crate upon crate of them, are a nettlesome part of Elizabeth 
Hoxworth's life. Grapefruit too. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, she sells them as part of the fund-raising drive for her son's 
nursery school. She and her husband are expected to sell 35 crates of citrus 
fruit, at about $18 each, with the proceeds going into the school's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good stuff, but finding 35 people to buy a crate each is tough," said 
Hoxworth, 34, of Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's just for starters. There was, for instance, the ill-timed candy 
drive put on by her daughter's gymnastics school -- beginning the week after 
Halloween. Then there is the annual Girl Scout cookie drive. And there are the 
others in the neighborhood who come knocking, peddling everything from 
poinsettias to pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not one thing, it's another," she said. "We have a network in which 
we buy things from other people if they buy things from us, but it gets kind of 
crazy after a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoxworth is part of a huge army of parental peddlers. In the name of doing 
what's best for their children, they spend hour upon hour hawking wares for the 
benefit of schools, athletic programs and other causes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, they inundate relatives, neighbors and co-workers with all 
manner of goodies, from Girl Scout cookies (deliveries start this week) to 
Christmas gift wrap to hundreds of other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Such parental fund raising has become a billion-dollar-plus industry that 
finds its way into millions of households. Although fund raising has been 
around for as long as causes have needed extra cash, there has been a surfeit 
of it in recent years. And the target is almost always individual donors, who 
contribute 80 cents on the dollar of all charitable giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the reason for the increase in fund raising by parents -- and one that 
is especially evident in California -- is that governments have less money for 
school and recreational activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just a lot less money out there that's available," said Russell 
Lemieux, executive director of the Atlanta-based Assn. of Fund Raisers and 
Direct Sellers, whose members provide the products and sales know-how to 
organizations in need of raising money. Membership in the association has 
expanded from 75 in 1989 to more than 500 today. 
</P>
<P>
 He puts on two trade shows a year to showcase the vast array of items that can 
be hawked in the name of worthy causes. Lemieux himself has prepared a brochure 
listing 42 categories of goods that are commonly sold, including such things as 
frozen entrees and bird food. To hear the fund-raisers tell it, gone are the 
days when people would simply dip into their wallets and give cash to a good 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't going to do that," said Lyne Bailey of Irvine's Pot-O-Gold 
Sales, which specializes in putting on fund-raisers. "People want something for 
their dollar. They are willing to help out, but they want something for their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 By far, the most recognizable and successful of this category is the Girl 
Scout cookie, with millions sold each year by Brownies, Girl Scouts and, of 
course, their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 That venture alone generates $400 million a year. But it also has had its 
share of controversy of late. The Girl Scout organization has come under fire 
during the past year for the small percentage of the proceeds that filters down 
to the troop level -- more than half the take is used to support the Scout 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane St. George, assistant executive director of the Mt. Wilson Vista Council, 
said there has been some reaction to the stories, but it was hardly 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some of that, but it's been minimal," she said. "We've also been 
inundated with calls from people who want to know where they can buy Girl Scout 
cookies." 
</P>
<P>
 There are all manner of other fund-raisers too, for children's activities that 
happen so often it's hard to keep them straight, particularly those put on by 
underfunded schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got four kids in Catholic school and I'm being hit up all the time," 
said Frank Cronin, managing partner of the Los Angeles office of Jackson, 
Lewis, Schnitzler & Krupman law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of solicitation turns up in the oddest of places. New York Giants 
linebacker Lawrence Taylor, one of the toughest men in football, was seen 
working the locker room last September, selling candy and nuts for his son's 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 According to newspaper accounts, Taylor approached rookie Tommy Thigpen about 
buying some cashews. Thigpen demurred, saying he didn't like them. To which the 
much-feared Taylor replied, perhaps in jest, "Now you do." Thigpen bought the 
cashews. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor was, in effect, selling in his office, which is where most parents head 
when they have a product that needs to be peddled. It is not unusual in many 
offices for employees to be selling the same item at the same time, 
particularly in Girl Scout season. Arguments have been known to arise about 
territorial boundaries. Interoffice computer messages tell of cookies and candy 
for sale. The company fax machine often comes into play. Bosses have been known 
to exert none-too-subtle pressure on underlings in the name of a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who thinks the fund raising has gone too far is Rob Hallwachs, an 
employee of the Metropolitan Water District, who said he is hit up about once a 
week. Last week, for instance, there was an Easter candy sale on his floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've started saying that one day I'm going to have kids and soak all of my 
co-workers for everything they have taken me for over the years," he said. "For 
a single guy, it's onerous. You wind up buying everything from chocolate to 
stuffed animals to you name it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Adams, who works for AT&T's San Francisco office, said it is not so much 
the fact that so many people are pushing their children's causes but what is 
being sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a person who loves to eat, I hate it that it's candy they are always 
trying to foist off on us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such peddling has even found its way into City Hall. Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer 
was recently observed selling $1 candy bars in her office to benefit her son's 
soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Southern California Gas Co., longtime employee Bob Acosta sold about 40 
boxes of Girl Scout cookies in a day. He doesn't see any problems -- most of 
the people who buy from him end up selling to him later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all reciprocal," he said. Besides, he doesn't want his daughter selling 
door to door because it is too dangerous. "It's just what today is all about," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a catch to office-selling, one that could set employers on edge. 
Non-union businesses run the risk of helping labor unions through their doors 
if they let parents sell their wares at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Horn, of the Los Angeles office of the National Labor Relations Board, 
said labor lawyers generally advise non-union companies to ban the sale of all 
items at work, lest they set a precedent that could allow union organizers to 
pass out sign-up cards. He said company rules prohibiting sales in the 
workplace may be all but ignored until there is whispering about a union vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, it's the most important rule they've got," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal issues aside, there is some serious opposition to the growing number of 
school-based fund-raisers from a source that might at first seem surprising: 
the national office of the Parent Teachers Assn. in Chicago. The national PTA 
says its local chapters should concentrate on being advocacy groups, and that 
fund raising, even for good causes, makes government less responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Crouse, the chairwoman of the PTA's education commission, said fund 
raising can cause governments, over time, to assume that money will always be 
provided by an alternate source, namely, parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They end up footing the bill forever," she said. "It becomes a pattern. They 
say, 'We don't have to fund this because the PTA will do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that fund raising causes major disparities in school districts, 
or even among schools in the same district, when well-to-do parents bankroll 
projects that others cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're living in a housing project, you can't write the check," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime professional fund-raiser Mark Jones of Grover City, a Central 
California coastal community, said one basic rule about fund raising is this: 
Don't do it if the money can be found elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell people that fund raising is work and that you need community 
support," he said. "If you don't really need it, then you shouldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are causes that have, in fact, found an alternative to parental 
peddling. It is the use of scrip purchased from schools and churches that can 
be used as money at participating stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents buy scrip from a school, for instance, which can be used to buy food 
at the local grocery store. The school turns the money over to the store. When 
the scrip coupons are redeemed, the store gives a percentage -- usually 6% or 
more -- of the scrip sales total back to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary McAboy, a spokeswoman for the Vons grocery chain, said the scrip program 
evolved from the days when gift certificates were offered to large companies at 
a discount. Schools and churches then asked to be included. 
</P>
<P>
 Rina Ngo, the principal of Our Lady of Fatima School in Artesia, said revenues 
from scrip account for one-sixth of the school's budget and have allowed them 
to put a cap on tuition. She said 20 outlets, including Kmart and Toys R Us, 
participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arcadia School District also used scrip to raise money. Marilyn Daleo, a 
spokeswoman for the district, said their promotion of scrip is quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say that everyone has to eat," she said. "Everyone needs groceries, so 
why not use scrip?"

ECONOMISTS PLAY 'HAPPY DAYS' AS MANY SING BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a utopia of next-to-no inflation, a fantasy land of declining 
deficits, a dreamscape of rising job prospects and new opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like an economist's mad ravings? In fact, these visions are now held by 
various authorities on the U.S. economy who describe underlying conditions -- 
and future prospects -- as the healthiest in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're back to 1964," said Rudiger Dornbusch, an economics professor at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring to the time before rampant 
inflation, oil shocks, exploding debt and relentless federal budget deficits. 
"The challenge is to give better answers than we did back then." 
</P>
<P>
 "I see rebirth, revival and renewal," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at 
Lehman Brothers Inc., a financial services firm in New York. "The economy is 
the healthiest I've seen since the early 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
 The rave reviews may sound crazy to the millions of Americans scraping by with 
low wages or none at all. Jittery investors can point to rising interest rates 
as reason for doubt. In recession-weary Southern California, the soaring 
optimism may seem downright bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the skeptics, an unusual array of evidence seems to make the case 
that the U.S. economy is on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation is at bay. The deficit is declining. Factories are churning. 
Productivity is rallying. 
</P>
<P>
 American firms are winning battles in the global marketplace after years of 
getting whacked, while Japan and Germany struggle with a morass of financial 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all that, the 1980s' legacy of debt-ravaged companies, households 
and banks is fading. 
</P>
<P>
 It all could mean that a period of prolonged prosperity is approaching, goes 
the cheerful view, a new chapter unhindered by debt and other hobgoblins that 
have weighed down the economy for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall as good an underlying base for the long-term outlook . . . in 
the last two or three decades," Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told 
members of Congress recently. An "extraordinary achievement" is how he 
described the state of affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The achievement hasn't been cost-free. Nor does it belong to any one 
Administration, economists agree, although many credit President Clinton's 
deficit-cutting plan last year as a helpful contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. economy, it seems, has answered its detractors with an unexpected 
burst of resilience since the trouble-plagued 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 From automobiles to computers, entertainment to finance, U.S. industries are 
powerful players once again, reflecting what Dornbusch calls "a quantum jump" 
in the nation's competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, for example, the government reported that worker 
productivity increased at a solid 4.2% rate in late 1993 and that labor costs 
actually fell. In the 1990s so far, productivity has been growing at about 
double the pace of the past two decades, fueled largely by manufacturing, the 
Labor Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, by contrast, has registered practically no advances in productivity 
since 1992, while Germany's labor costs have rocketed at almost twice the U.S. 
rate, according to the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our competitive position is probably better than it has been at any point 
since the early 1960s," said Steven S. Roach, a senior economist at the Morgan 
Stanley Group Inc., an investment banking firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if these are the good times, millions of workers might wonder why they 
don't feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 In graphic contrast to past recoveries, U.S. companies have enhanced their 
ability to compete in the world by slashing payrolls, loading up on 
labor-saving technology and restricting hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers announced nearly 109,000 job cuts in January alone, the highest 
monthly toll in at least five years, according to a survey by Challenger, Gray 
& Christmas, an outplacement consulting firm. Last year, employers announced 
615,000 layoffs, according to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 America's economic rivals, meanwhile, are just beginning that unpleasant 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Germany is perhaps 10% of the way into this restructuring, while we're 
perhaps 75% to 80% of the way there," said Ross DeVol, an economist for the 
WEFA Group. "Japan is just starting to cope with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now some of the same experts who applauded the corporate slash-and-burn drive 
say it's time to shift into a phase of building and creating, a strategy that 
should spawn well-paying jobs. Otherwise, they argue, companies risk gutting 
themselves and undermining the broader economy in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk is that we fixate too long on cost-cutting and downsizing," Roach 
said. "It's time to move into an era of rebuilding and renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 A January survey by the American Business Conference, a coalition of 
fast-growing, medium-size firms, hints that at least some growth is in the 
works. Almost half the firms surveyed -- 47% -- expect higher wages for workers 
early this year. Another 45% anticipate rising business investment, and 25% 
foresee increased hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing here is an extensive rate of growth that finally is broad 
enough and deep enough to increase the demand for new hires," said Barry 
Rogstad, president of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the nature of the growth, more than the rate of growth -- which is 
expected to exceed a respectable 3% this year -- that has some experts so 
excited. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the red-ink epidemic of the past, many families are improving 
their financial health these days. An index of household finances, which 
considers debt burdens, interest payments, disposable income and other 
variables, has improved by 27.5% since the low point in 1990, according to 
Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar tale emerges from the corporate world, where companies are finally 
putting the 1980s' legacy of debt behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest charges, as a share of overall cash flow, are now just 60% of the 
level they were a few years back. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pluses jump out, according to Robert F. Wescott, a senior economist on 
the White House Council of Economic Advisers: lean business inventories, signs 
of emerging income gains, solid spending by consumers -- all at a time when 
federal spending has fallen as a share of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, a wide range of efficient private enterprises are driving the 
recovery, which bubbled along at a 5.9% rate in the final three months of 1993. 
"It's not just one strong quarter of economic growth," Wescott said. "It's the 
whole story of the economy that feels so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, even the trade deficit can be seen as a sign of U.S. strength. 
That is because the expanding U.S. economy last year pulled in $115.8 billion 
more in imports than it was able to sell to customers in weaker economies 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wescott and others say they anticipate a helpful kick to the U.S. recovery 
around 1995, when Germany and Japan may break out of their slumps and start 
buying more U.S.-made products. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the view that a golden economic era beckons is more a matter of 
faith than an accepted fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubters cite the nation's low savings rate and troubled school system as 
reasons to be skeptical. It is only a matter of time, some say, before U.S. 
rivals emerge from recession and mount economic comebacks of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 White House critics worry that Clinton's goals for health care reform and 
worker training could saddle employers with higher labor expenses, wiping out 
much of the progress in cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Even businesses' rising equipment outlays -- up 15% last year -- raise 
questions, because much of the money has gone for information technology, which 
saves labor, rather than bricks-and-mortar expansion, which stimulates the need 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not terribly bullish on the economy," said Allan Reynolds, a conservative 
economist at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis. "I think there might be a 
short and weak expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 The public also is wary. In a Los Angeles Times Poll last month, 58% of 
respondents said the nation remains in recession. Another 54% said the country 
was generally moving on the wrong track; 36% said it was on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are deeply concerned about these fundamental issues, the lack of 
progress in real wages, the relatively high unemployment rates," said John P. 
White, director of the Center of Business and Government at Harvard 
University's Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the optimists prove right, the implications are staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 America's weaker regional economies, notably Southern California, would 
gradually be pulled forward by a stronger national locomotive because local 
firms will be able to sell more products and services to the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, a stable prosperity would afford the United States greater 
maneuvering room to concentrate on a long list of social needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means we can focus on other issues -- like education and crime and welfare 
reform and health care," Dornbusch said. "The economic issue is quickly 
becoming a non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, a host of troubles could sabotage the picture: A full-blown trade 
war with Japan, political instability in Russia or China, a new oil price 
shock, a U.S. policy miscue or an unexpected burst of inflation are just some 
of the possible booby traps. 
</P>
<P>
 But those dangers aren't new. What's noteworthy is the no-holds-barred 
enthusiasm from some who have monitored the economy's ups and downs for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere I look, I see signs of health," said Sinai, who has advised both 
the Clinton and Bush administrations. "For years, everywhere I looked I saw 
signs of growing sickness. It is a pleasure to report."

EPA SMOG PLAN IS JUST THE START OF NEGOTIATIONS; POLLUTION: FEDERAL MANDATE TO 
CLEAN UP THE AIR BY 2010 WILL FORCE SOUTHLAND BUSINESS LEADERS AND GOVERNMENT 
AGENCIES TO END THEIR ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP AND FIND COMMON GROUND. NEW 
ALLIANCES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE TO SOFTEN THE ECONOMIC BLOW ACROSS THE REGION.

<P>
 When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency jolted California with its tough 
plan for clean air last week, the agency's regional administrator called it 
"the end of the line" in the state's decades-old struggle to control its 
notorious smog. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Southern California's business leaders, the federal government's 
foot-thick binder of proposed regulations is only the beginning of six painful 
and turbulent months of negotiating, lobbying and compromising. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1970s, the politics of smog in the Southland has taken on a life of 
its own, with endless maneuvering among regulators, business leaders and 
environmentalists, each pushing their own agenda. But this time, most observers 
predict, the players will have to change their ways and find some common 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 They will have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is under court order to clean up California's smoggiest cities. By 
next February, final smog-control regulations must be in place to ensure that 
the Los Angeles Basin -- home of the nation's worst air -- achieves health 
standards by 2010. Under the same court order, the Sacramento metropolitan area 
and Ventura County have until 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last 20 years (of smog control) have been quite adversarial," said 
Felicia Marcus, who heads the EPA's western regional office in San Francisco. 
"Now there is a potential for a critical mass where people are tired of 
complaining. . . . If folks want us not to regulate them, they (had) better 
come up with better measures." 
</P>
<P>
 New alliances of businesses are expected to emerge -- not to just complain or 
lobby, but to attempt some consensus building among themselves and develop 
alternatives that might soften the economic blow across the region and still 
meet clean-air mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to recognize that 'X' amount of tons of pollution have to come out of 
the atmosphere," said Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of 
Commerce. "We can't fall backward in the progress we've made in air quality. 
Nobody finds that acceptable. But we don't want to adopt something that will 
stimulate a huge massive outward migration of job opportunities either." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal plan, nearly every source of smog will be regulated to cut 
pollution -- motor vehicles, the trucking industry, trains, airlines, 
factories, fuels, small businesses, construction equipment, recreational boats, 
off-road vehicles, paint companies, pesticide manufacturers and many others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration was forced into developing its far-reaching plan 
after environmentalists sued the EPA to clean up smog in the Los Angeles Basin, 
arguing that local and state officials had failed in their efforts to meet 
health standards. After years of legal wrangling, the EPA lost an appeal to the 
U.S. Supreme Court in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although details of the nearly 100 proposed rules in the EPA plan are likely 
to change, the court will not allow the agency to waver from its goal -- full 
attainment of health standards for ozone and carbon monoxide in the state's 
smoggiest regions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, 
meeting the court order is especially daunting: 90% of hydrocarbons and 70% of 
nitrogen oxides, the two ingredients of ozone, the area's worst pollutant, must 
be eliminated by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 "EPA's one condition is that this plan has to achieve the required emission 
reductions. Everything else is negotiable," said Los Angeles attorney Robert 
Wyman, who represents aerospace firms, the oil industry and other major 
manufacturers in air-quality issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Barrow, the EPA's director of the agency's air quality planning office 
in San Francisco, said the goal is to make clean air "a shared responsibility" 
among all businesses and governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to have different industry sectors talking among each other about 
how to balance it, and decide what they can live with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA expects a dizzying volume of input from hundreds of trade groups and 
individual companies. About 1,000 information packages summarizing the rules 
were mailed out when the plan was unveiled Tuesday, and another 150 people 
called the EPA last week requesting copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business leaders fear that accepting the EPA's plan will have major 
statewide -- even national -- ramifications for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 If the anti-smog measures on airlines increase the cost of flying into Los 
Angeles, it could have an impact on the state's tourism industry. If shippers 
find smog rules at the Port of Los Angeles too costly or restrictive, they 
might haul their cargo or passengers elsewhere along the West Coast. 
Consequently, it may benefit every industry to find alternatives for those 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the document as it now stands would create huge economic dislocations 
in Southern California," Remy said. "We're going to have to spend a fair amount 
of time pointing out areas of difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration also has expressed serious concern, with state 
Secretary for Environmental Protection James M. Strock saying many parts of the 
federal plan "have little chance of success." 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed federal plan adversely impacts all phases of the California 
economy without regard to building the kind of public support necessary to 
achieve cleaner air," Strock said. "Absent fundamental change, this plan would 
find few champions among Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmental activists say they welcome the inevitable give-and-take 
among businesses and promise to be flexible in their views on how the final 
plan shapes up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really do see this as an opportunity for a collaboration, to try to find 
the best strategies that clean the air in the most fair way and give us new 
economic opportunities," said Denny Zane of the Coalition for Clean Air, the 
lead environmental group that sued the EPA. "There is certainly an opportunity 
for reasonable changes that give us similar results." 
</P>
<P>
 Californians will have to work fast. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials will accept public input on the proposals only until August, and 
then they will sequester themselves until next February, when they must 
finalize the rules. By April 1, the EPA plans to hold the first of a series of 
public workshops, mostly for the various industries. Public hearings will be 
held in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to have some pretty earnest discussions," Marcus said. "We're 
already engaging folks in real discussions about the best way to get (clean 
air)." 
</P>
<P>
 Most business representatives will take several weeks just to decipher the 
plan's details, much less develop a plan of action. The various proposals fill 
about 1,600 pages -- so unwieldy that the agency has displayed them on an 
electronic bulletin board for quick access. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The debate) will be heated, but it will be slow heat. It's going to take 
time for people to realize the impact. They first have to sit down and read 
it," said Tom Eichhorn, communications director for the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District, the agency responsible for cleaning the air in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses and environmentalists won't be the only ones trying to come up with 
substitutes for the EPA regulations. State and local politicians and 
air-quality officials also will play a major role. Under the federal Clean Air 
Act, the state is required to propose a clean-air strategy by Nov. 15, and the 
EPA hopes the state plan will be rigorous enough to supplant the federal 
proposal eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these key players have been through tough negotiations before, 
especially in the late 1980s, when state and local smog regulators came up with 
their clean air plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the federal plan, an array of influential interstate industries based 
outside California -- airlines, trucking, the shipping industry and 
recreational boat manufacturers -- are targeted for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest outcry probably will come from them, with the likely argument 
being they are a small part of the pollution problem. But Remy, Wyman and 
others representing Southland industries counter that everyone now is a small 
part, since oil refineries and other major polluters already have been forced 
to spend millions to slash emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The natural reaction is 'Why me?"' Wyman said. "There tends to be a learning 
curve for regulated industries. Those regulated the most and for the longest, 
such as the refineries and utilities, tend to be the most sophisticated in the 
public comments. They bring up alternatives, and they tend to question less the 
goals of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The California motorist, responsible for more than half the state's 
smog-causing emissions, is one target all these industries may all end up 
agreeing on. 
</P>
<P>
 State air-quality officials have long debated such politically unpopular 
proposals as charging commuters a fee for miles driven or designating no-drive 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 No such measures are incorporated in the EPA plan, partly because the agency 
has no clear authority to enforce them and partly because the Clinton 
Administration believes such social changes should be left to local control. 
But some industries are expected to lobby the AQMD and state and local 
government to take on California's drivers and take some of the burden off 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some say California clean-air issues are so entangled that it may take 
an act of Congress to come up with a solution. They say that, even as they 
quickly point out that Congress took more than a decade to agree on new Clean 
Air Act amendments before finally passing them in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It very well may come down to . . . the business community will be flat out 
opposed to what is in this plan," Remy said. "There is recourse to Congress, 
but that is a difficult road to travel."

PAKISTANIS HELD HOSTAGE BY 3 AFGHAN GUNMEN; CRIME: THE MASKED MEN HIJACK A 
SCHOOL BUS AND DEMAND $5 MILLION. SOME CHILDREN ARE RELEASED.

<P>
 Three Afghans armed with pistols and hand grenades hijacked a school bus to 
Islamabad from the northwestern Pakistani town of Peshawar on Sunday, taking 73 
schoolchildren and staff hostage, officials and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 The masked gunmen, who later released all but 16 Pakistani schoolboys, said 
they wanted $5 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the gunmen said they would free the boys, ages 12 to 14, only after 
food supplies were delivered to the beleaguered Afghan capital, Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want guarantees that food has reached and been distributed equally among 
the people of Kabul," one of the gunmen said, outlining their demands in an 
interview with a reporter of the British Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not enemies of the children, and when we are sure supplies have gone 
to Kabul we will release them," the gunman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Afghans allowed the bus to be moved from its initial position outside the 
Parliament building and entered the Afghan Embassy with their hostages after 
negotiations began with Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar. 
</P>
<P>
 Babar said he had offered to meet their demands for food to war-shattered 
Kabul and a safe passage back to Afghanistan but had refused a ransom demand. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the gunmen had asked for 2,000 truckloads of food for Kabul, where 900 
people have been killed and 10,500 injured in bloody battles for power between 
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar since Jan. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said we will give you more, and we will give you medicines also if you 
want," Babar said. "I will ensure your safe passage and take you by helicopter 
anywhere you want in Afghanistan." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of police cordoned off the embassy and the orange bus that was 
hijacked in Peshawar, 100 miles from Islamabad, as it was picking up children 
to take them to school early Sunday.

MANDELA BLAMES RIVAL IN KILLINGS OF ANC WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ANC leader Nelson Mandela on Sunday blamed his main black rival, Chief 
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, for a massacre of young African National Congress 
election workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Attackers used automatic weapons and knives early Saturday to kill 15 ANC 
supporters -- 12 of them teen-agers -- preparing to conduct a voter education 
program in the Natal village of Mahele, 300 miles southeast of 
Johannesburg.Police have been unable to trace the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi, the head of the Inkatha Freedom Party, condemned the massacre. But 
Mandela said the Zulu nationalist is fanning violence with his opposition to 
the country's first all-race election. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the results of that talk, which we regard as irresponsible talk," 
Mandela told reporters Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela criticized calls from leaders in the violence-torn Natal region to 
resist the April 26-28 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them has gone so far as to say he does not want to lie and to promise 
the people of Natal that there will be no bloodshed in the course of their 
campaign to disrupt the election," Mandela said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a reference to Buthelezi, who told a rally of his followers earlier 
this month that his call for an election boycott could lead to violence.

YEMENI LEADERS SIGN PACT TO END CRISIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feuding Yemeni leaders signed a reconciliation agreement Sunday designed to 
end a six-month leadership crisis and bring about political and economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a state ceremony here, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his vice 
president, Ali Salim Bidh, signed the 32-page document, which also bore the 
signatures of 39 other Yemeni politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement envisages a dilution of presidential powers and decentralization 
of authority aimed at better distribution of resources and economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidh and his southern Yemeni followers have accused the northern Yemenis, led 
by Saleh, of trying to dominate the country and failing to unify the armed 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Present-day Yemen was created in May, 1990, when North Yemen and South Yemen 
merged, but it has been plagued by political violence and a breakdown in law 
and order.

PEACE TALKS TO START IN MEXICO BETWEEN REBELS, GOVERNMENT; REVOLT: INSURGENTS' 
DEMANDS FOR LAND AND WATER THREATEN ELITE. NATIONAL POLITICAL REFORM MAY BE 
TOPIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Talks aimed at peacefully ending a seven-week Indian uprising are scheduled to 
begin today in this city's colonial cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the four oldest temples in the Americas and once the church of 
16th-Century activist for Indian rights Fray Bartolome de las Casas, the site 
symbolizes the issues that rebels and a government negotiator have agreed to 
discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 Centuries of poverty and repression in Chiapas, Mexico's most southern state, 
are expected to lead the agenda. The rebels have also insisted on talking about 
national political reform, although government peace negotiator Manuel Camacho 
Solis has said he will not make a commitment on that touchy subject. 
</P>
<P>
 To strengthen their demands for serious discussion of national issues, the 
rebels invited the country's political parties to attend the talks. Six have 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that decades of demands cannot be resolved at one fell swoop, 
but I know that with great effort and honesty, advances can be made," Camacho 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond funneling more money into the state, as the government has already 
pledged to do, it was not clear what Camacho is prepared to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel demands for more land and water directly conflict with the interests of 
a powerful ruling elite that has unabashedly supported the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, Mexico's ruling party for more than six decades. They also 
could put pressure on environmental efforts to protect the Lacandon, North 
America's last rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 However, government priorities have shifted rapidly since New Year's Day, when 
thousands of well-organized Indian guerrillas took control of several towns, 
including this one, and declared war on the Mexican army. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next 11 days, more than 100 people were killed in confrontations 
between the rebels and the army. Investigations by international human rights 
organizations led to accusations of army abuses of civilians and suspected 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The government called a unilateral cease-fire on Jan. 12 and has been seeking 
talks ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho and mediator Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas and a 
well-known Indian-rights activist, arrived at the cathedral Sunday morning in 
Red Cross ambulances with at least 18 rebel delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 All the delegates were masked and armed. About half were dressed in the rebel 
uniform of dark pants and shirt and a red bandanna. The others wore traditional 
Indian clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation included Sub-commander Marcos, the masked rebel leader who is 
the voice of revolution in southern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 For the talks, Camacho said, the cathedral was ringed by three "circles of 
neutrality" formed by International Red Cross and Mexican Red Cross 
representatives and other non-governmental groups. Unarmed military police 
formed a security cordon around them.

AMERICAN ALBUM: A CAREFREE -- AND CHEAP -- APPROACH TO WORRIES; FOR ONLY $5, AN 
ARIZONA GURU WILL TAKE ASHES FROM YOUR (WRITTEN) PROBLEM AND TOSS THEM TO THE 
WINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gregg Warren's admittedly crazy idea has struck like lightning, turning him 
into something of a guru for America's worrywarts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an odd line of work for the decidedly un-gurulike Warren, a 44-year-old 
Los Angeles refugee and former college tennis player with a nice tan, a bald 
spot, cowboy boots and an easy smile. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's also a devotee of Buddhist philosophy who believes that one of the 
best ways to get rid of your worries is to toss them out the window of an 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren calls his soaring little concern Worry Free, and it goes like this: If 
you have worries, write them on a piece of paper, burn the paper, send Warren 
the ashes and, for $5, he'll toss them out of a plane over the tiny town of 
Carefree. 
</P>
<P>
 The response has been astonishing: Since July, Warren has handled in the 
neighborhood of 5,000 such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started doing this as a lark," he said. "But people really believe in it. I 
think they're looking for answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren said he came up with the idea after spending a month in Thailand 
studying with Buddhist monks. One of the techniques they used to maintain peace 
of mind was to reduce their troubles to ashes and wear them in a pouch around 
their necks. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few days, they would trundle up to the mountains and toss them into 
the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Buddhists say that people take a thought and attach to it, and they have 
to find a way to detach," said Warren, who recently left Los Angeles after 14 
years in the commercial real estate business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thoughts are real things, like cars or lawn mowers. The more we hold on to 
them, the more cluttered the mind is and the less peace there is. In 
meditation, you learn to let those things go." 
</P>
<P>
 When Warren returned home, a deceased relative was cremated and the ashes were 
scattered from a plane. That got him thinking. He discussed the Worry Free idea 
with friends, which resulted in about 15 requests to scatter their worries. 
</P>
<P>
 They told him it worked, so he took out a small newspaper ad and waited for 
worrywarts to beat a path to his post office box. 
</P>
<P>
 So many have torched their troubles and shipped them to Warren that he had to 
stop sending back a Worry Free certificate and a page of handy suggestions for 
ditching worries. 
</P>
<P>
 These included gazing into a large candle flame while concentrating on 
transferring your worry into the flame. Then blowing out the candle. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tip was to pick out a tree, and as you're walking to it, immerse your 
mind in one worry. Make it bigger than anything in your life. Completely weigh 
yourself down with it. Then hit the tree and be rid of it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Warren was spending close to $2.50 on each shipment of certificates and 
suggestions, and it got to be too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want this to work for people," said Warren -- who has a pilot's 
license but no plane, so every time he goes up he has to rent one for around 
$70 an hour. "If I make $2,000 on this or $10,000, it doesn't make any 
difference to me." 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of Warren's worriers include letters detailing their troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some samples: Can't pay the rent. Haven't filed my taxes for two years. What 
does my blind date look like? I'm too short. I'm too fat. How will I look this 
summer in my bathing suit? 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on. Some are funny: I worry because all I seem to do is worry. 
Afraid I'll bounce the check I wrote to the company that consolidated my bills. 
Won't be able to afford my bankruptcy. My biggest worry is that Rush Limbaugh 
might be right. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the letters are serious. One worrier wrote: "Just doing this is a 
release and I might send more. Is that OK?" Another said: "I feel better 
already." 
</P>
<P>
 One desperate soul wrote: "I know that God is alive and living in Carefree." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren says that such cries for help tell him that his simple idea has hit a 
powerful nerve. He's got a backlog of 100 sets of ashes to scatter, then he's 
planning to write a Worry Free book and conduct Worry Free seminars. But first 
he wants to finish the acting class he's taking. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, that's the worry guru's biggest worry: that he won't have enough time 
to do the things he wants to do in life. Like everyone else's, his brain works 
overtime producing too many thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've clocked human thoughts at a thousand a minute," he said. "Think of it 
as stock quotations with the numbers running along on a board. The trick is 
getting these thoughts out of your head. When you write them down, you're 
halfway home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go to a shrink who'll charge $100, and after an hour all he'll be 
able to tell you is your name. I charge $5." 
</P>
<P>
 But dumping ashes out the window of a plane has its hazards. The first time he 
did it, the ashes were in a manila envelope, and most of them blew back in his 
face. Now he puts them into a long-stemmed plastic bottle for easy dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, they probably come down somewhere in New Mexico," Warren said. 
"But what matters is that they're thrown out over Carefree."

HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP DETAILS CHINA'S POLITICAL IMPRISONMENTS

<P>
 More than 1,700 people are imprisoned in China for political "offenses" 
ranging from printing sex books and a marriage manual to distributing a list of 
people arrested at a demonstration, a human rights group said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a computer database and a variety of sources, Asia Watch said its report 
shows that Chinese political repression is increasing, not decreasing, as some 
U.S. officials have said.The U.S.-based human rights monitoring group called 
its report the most comprehensive account of arbitrary detention ever 
published. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was the worst for political arrests and trials in China since the 
crackdown against the democracy movement in 1989, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report comes amid increased U.S. scrutiny of China's human rights record 
as the Clinton Administration decides whether to continue normal trade 
relations with China.

MUSLIM UNREST IN CHINA CONFIRMED; RELIGION: OFFICIAL NEWS AGENCY SAYS 22 PEOPLE 
RECEIVED LONG PRISON TERMS THIS MONTH IN CONNECTION WITH DEADLY RIOT IN MAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a rare confirmation of unrest among China's Muslims, official sources said 
Sunday that 49 people were killed when paramilitary police units moved in to 
suppress fighting between rival religious groups outside a Ningxia province 
mosque last May. 
</P>
<P>
 The official New China News Agency said 22 people, including a prominent 
Ningxia province political leader and two Muslim academics, were sentenced to 
long prison terms this month after they were convicted on charges that included 
murder and "unlawfully buying guns and ammunition" in connection with the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese authorities claimed they confiscated 5,442 guns and 21 homemade 
cannons after what they described as "gang fighting" in the city of Xiji, 700 
miles southwest of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ningxia incident was the bloodiest in a series of Muslim disturbances that 
occurred in western China last year. Incidents involving China's Muslims -- who 
number between 20 million and 40 million, according to various estimates -- are 
a sensitive issue with the Chinese Communist government, particularly in light 
of Muslim nationalist and fundamentalist movements in the former southern 
Soviet republics and other regions of Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 7, Chinese military forces stormed a mosque in Xining, capital of 
Qinghai province, and arrested Muslim leaders who the government claimed had 
"assaulted local party and government offices, smashed police vehicles and 
besieged and attacked people and security and armed policemen." 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrations by Muslims protesting the publication of a children's book they 
claimed insulted the Islamic faith were also reported in Gansu, Xinjiang and 
Sichuan provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 Ningxia province is the center of China's Hui Muslim minority population that 
converted to Islam when the region was an important destination for Arab 
traders in the 7th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times in Chinese history, the Ningxia population has figured in 
extensive demonstrations against the country's authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the incident in May appeared to involve rival religious groups 
attempting to win control of a regional sect, Chinese authorities fear any 
episode that could ignite the scattered Muslim population and threaten to 
divide the country. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the New China News Agency, one of those arrested in Ningxia was a 
prominent local politician, Ma Liesun, who served on the national committee in 
Beijing representing China's minority populations. He was sentenced to 15 years 
in prison and stripped of his political rights for four years after his 
conviction for "intentional murder" and various gun charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Ma Fuli, associate professor at the Ningxia Normal College, and Ma Rucheng, 
described as a farmer, were charged with the same crimes and sentenced to life 
imprisonment. Ma Jie, a lecturer at the Northwest No. 2 Nationalities 
Institute, received a sentence of 20 years, also on the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in May, 1992, the news agency reported, the four men "organized gang 
fighting and revenge despite warnings from the local government and Communist 
Party committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Ningxia province, where the incident took place, has long been a 
stronghold of Sufism, the mystical school of Islam that has often played a role 
in revolts against authority in China. 
</P>
<P>
 In widespread Muslim revolts between 1855 and 1873, a powerful Sufi leader 
named Ma Hualong held Qing Dynasty armies at bay for years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, the fighting in May was the result of a succession 
battle in the Sufi Zheherenye sect following the death of the sect's imam, Ma 
Tenghai, in June, 1991. The sect is reported to have 100,000 followers in 
Ningxia. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest to replace Ma Tenghai turned to violence, with rival parties 
battling outside the Xiji mosque when Chinese People's Armed Police were 
called. Authorities did not say how many of the dead, if any, had been killed 
by police gunfire.

AS EL SALVADOR VOTE NEARS, POLARIZED PAST STILL PRESENT; POLITICS: IN THE 
POSTWAR ELECTION, BALLOTS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO BE CAST FOR THE FAR RIGHT OR 
LEFT. THE IDEA OF AN ORGANIZED CENTER SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The television commercial begins with scenes of maimed children and burning 
buses. "Suspend the past!" the announcer says sarcastically, suggesting it is 
impossible to forget the civil war that this country lived for more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 As El Salvador prepares to vote in historic presidential elections next month, 
the past is very much present. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections are seen here as a crucial test of El Salvador's troubled 
efforts to restore peace and build democracy after 12 years of war. To be held 
March 20, these are the first postwar elections and the first with full 
participation by the left. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the international community and many Salvadorans originally thought 
the elections would serve as a final chapter, the voting now seems to represent 
one more step in an incomplete process: Key reforms agreed to as part of 
landmark peace accords are still lagging. The electoral season has been plagued 
with violence, a dangerously flawed voter registration system and divisive 
campaigning that pits the war's former enemies directly against one another. 
</P>
<P>
 In this still-polarized country, polls suggest that Salvadorans will vote 
heavily for two extremes -- the government's right-wing candidate and a leftist 
politician representing former guerrillas. And although much of the electorate 
still refuses to say how it is leaning, an organized political center seems to 
have faded into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elections are a long way from fulfilling the expectations at the time the 
peace accords were signed," said political analyst Hector Dada. "We have the 
paradox that two forces created to further authoritarianism (the left and the 
right) are the ones which have to build democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 15, 1992, accords brokered by the United Nations put a formal end to a 
war between Marxist guerrillas and a succession of U.S.-backed governments that 
claimed about 75,000 lives. The rebels agreed to disarm, and the government 
agreed to a wide range of military, judicial and political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of the Cold War's bloodiest Central American conflict, El 
Salvador began to experience significant change. The army was cut in half, and 
guerrillas became civilian entrepreneurs. But many Salvadorans today wonder if 
the changes are permanent or if the country could revert to its violent past. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Calderon Sol, the former mayor of San Salvador, is the presidential 
candidate for the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena) party. He 
leads most polls, followed by Ruben Zamora, a legislator who heads a coalition 
of leftist parties and the former guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front (FMLN). 
</P>
<P>
 The past is present in both campaigns, with neither party able, or willing, to 
break completely with its extremist history, analysts say. The campaigns have 
failed to generate much enthusiasm in an apathetic, war-weary population, 
analysts, diplomats and politicians say. 
</P>
<P>
 Arena was founded by the late Roberto d'Aubuisson, a cashiered army major 
widely believed to have organized many of the death squads that terrorized this 
country during the 1980s and that may still be operating. Calderon Sol's name 
has frequently been linked to the death squads, allegations he denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, in contrast to the Arena campaign that took Alfredo Cristiani to 
the presidency in 1989, the party has revived the belligerent rhetoric typical 
of its early days as a fervently anti-Communist faction intolerant of 
opposition. Calderon Sol's supporters regularly invoke the party hymn, which 
pledges to make El Salvador "the tomb where the Reds will end up." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Calderon Sol's well-financed, well-organized campaign 
employs a vague, feel-good strategy of telling Salvadorans that they live 
better today thanks to an Arena government. Electing Calderon Sol will ensure 
continued stability and prosperity, the campaign promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked step by step to see our country in different conditions," Calderon 
Sol said during a recent campaign appearance at the El Presidente hotel in San 
Salvador. "The people know who it was that wanted to steer the country in 
another direction." 
</P>
<P>
 A new secret poll conducted by Arena shows, however, that while the party 
still leads, about two-thirds of those responding had a negative impression of 
Calderon Sol and a positive impression of Zamora, sources familiar with the 
poll said. The results have unnerved Arena campaign strategists, the sources 
said, and appear to indicate that Calderon Sol has failed to capitalize on 
Cristiani's relative popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora and the left, meanwhile, are struggling to convince a dubious public 
that they are ready and willing to join a system that they once rejected. 
Although Zamora has long participated in democratic politics, the guerrillas 
throughout the war prohibited their supporters from participating in elections, 
which they regarded as a farce, and they frequently burned city halls to 
disrupt voting. Now the left must reverse that historical mistrust among its 
own followers while allaying the fears of big business and traditional sectors 
of this society. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, analysts say, despite Zamora's personal popularity, the left has not 
yet been able to convey an image as a trustworthy party capable of governing. A 
case in point came when a faction within Zamora's coalition missed a filing 
deadline last month and effectively lost at least two congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora, who is scheduled to travel to Los Angeles this week on a fund-raising 
tour, campaigns by blaming the government for deteriorating social conditions, 
higher food prices and growing poverty, despite indexes showing substantial 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is fine; the people are bad off," he said during a San Salvador 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The third major presidential candidate is Fidel Chavez Mena, whose centrist 
Christian Democratic Party of the late President Jose Napoleon Duarte is the 
largest in the country but trails badly in all polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The right has been especially adept at exploiting the left's recent past, 
using provocative television commercials with scenes from the war to portray 
the FMLN coalition as warmongers who destroyed schools, bridges and the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The left, racked by division, disorganized and inexperienced, has not 
responded in kind and has failed to mount any sort of attack on Arena's 
history. FMLN officials say they decided not to confront Arena directly so that 
they can promote an image of conciliation over conflict and thus attract new 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "To remind people too much of the past would cause fear in some people, and 
that is not in our interest," said Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a senior FMLN 
official who is running for congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to (project) a new dimension, a new mentality. That is what will 
bring us new votes. Those who would vote for guerrillas are already sure votes 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts say the left has been intimidated into a meek campaign by the 
killings in recent months of two senior FMLN officials and several supporters. 
Several Arena members have also been slain, including two mid-level campaign 
officials last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections are coming at a time when the peace process is under strain. 
</P>
<P>
 The redistribution of land and the building of a professional police force, 
two reforms dictated by the peace accords that are considered key to lasting 
stability, are behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The resurgence of political violence triggered fears that death squads have 
been reactivated, and small groups of former combatants, angered at not having 
received promised land or other postwar benefits, have reportedly rearmed in 
some regions of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure, Cristiani named a four-member special commission to 
investigate the recent killings and whether death squads were involved. The 
commission, called the Joint Group, is not to explore any acts committed before 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence and the possibility that the peace process is in jeopardy have 
alarmed the Clinton Administration, which dispatched Brian Atwood, 
administrator of the Agency for International Development, to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 Atwood, who arrived last Monday as a special envoy of Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, took the unusual step of addressing the Arena-dominated 
National Assembly to express support for the elections and the probe into 
possible political murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear, given the history of this country, that when murder is 
committed, people believe it was committed by the other side," Atwood said in 
an interview with a small group of reporters. "What we fear is a return to the 
cycle of violence (and) retribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest threat to the elections is El Salvador's inordinately 
complicated voter registration system. Despite efforts by dozens of nonprofit 
groups, more than half a million people who registered to vote -- 20% of the 
electorate -- had not yet received their voter cards by Feb. 1, according to 
U.N. monitors.

BOSNIAN SERBS CHEER ARRIVAL OF 400 RUSSIAN PEACEKEEPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of Bosnian Serbs cheered the arrival of 400 Russian peacekeepers 
Sunday, lining the streets of the rebel stronghold of Pale and offering gifts 
of food and slivovitz, a local brandy distilled from plums. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians were redeployed from peacekeeping duty in Croatia as part of an 
agreement brokered by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin, the 
Kremlin's special envoy on the Balkan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian pledge to deploy the peacekeepers -- while urging the Serbs to 
withdraw their weapons from around Sarajevo -- gave Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic a way to pull back without seeming to bend to NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some of the Russian troops who arrived in Serb-held areas of the 
capital on Sunday said they understood their assignment here to have been made 
on condition there would be no North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The compromise was worked out so that if we Russians are here, there will be 
no need for air strikes," said Alexander Koznov, a chief warrant officer and 
20-year veteran of the Soviet and Russian armies. "We are here because we are 
the only people the Serbs trust."

 A doctor and nurse treating a patient in cardiac arrest were felled by fumes 
coming from the patient, and the hospital was forced to close its emergency 
room, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor and nurse were in stable condition at Riverside General Hospital, 
nursing supervisor Dolly Suban said.Four other medical staff members were 
treated and released at area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old female patient -- who had been undergoing chemotherapy cancer 
treatment at home -- died. An autopsy was pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Fumes from the patient forced Riverside General to move seven emergency room 
patients into a parking lot Saturday night. Four patients were transferred to 
other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the doctor and nurse were drawing blood from the woman when 
they noticed white crystals in it and smelled a substance like ammonia. Then 
they passed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Their names were not released.

 A boat carrying 20 to 40 would-be Haitian refugees to Florida capsized in 
shark-infested waters off the Bahamas on Sunday. At least five people died, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three people were known to have reached the safety of a beach off Green 
Turtle Cay, northeast of Great Abaco Island, said duty officer Rhonda Whaton of 
the Bahamas Air-Sea Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very gruesome," she said. "Unfortunately, there are sharks very active 
in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 The known dead were a woman and four children, Whaton said. She could not 
confirm if anyone was attacked by sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-foot boat capsized during the night and was spotted about midday by an 
American sailing vessel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter and three Bahamian boats were searching for 
survivors Sunday. No additional survivors had been found by Sunday evening, 
said Coast Guard Petty Officer Alex Worden in Miami.

 As Roman Catholic nuns approach the next century, a new nationwide survey 
confirms fears long voiced throughout the church: Nuns appear to be dying out 
as an institution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of 1,049 sisters in the United States and Puerto Rico, The Times 
found that only 3% were 40 or younger; 37% were older than 70 and 12% were more 
than 80. The median age for nuns in the survey was 65.

 "American Catholics have no idea how very soon there will be no nuns," said 
Sister Patricia Wittberg, a church sociologist at Indiana University and at a 
Purdue University facility in Indianapolis, after reviewing The Times data. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Eleace King, a research associate at the Center for Applied Research in 
the Apostolate at Georgetown University in Washington, concurred. "It tells me 
that the majority of religious congregations of women in this country will not 
survive. Most are dying," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest data comes at a time when the church has found a steady exodus of 
nuns, who in the first half of this century were a bulwark in the U.S. church 
and who continue to carry out its work. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 -- the latest year for which statistics are available -- there were 
94,022 nuns in the United States, compared to a peak of 181,421 in 1966. In 
1988 there were 106,912. 
</P>
<P>
 Most younger nuns are in their 40s, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 "My generation -- I'm a baby boomer -- is disproportionately underrepresented, 
nuns between 35 and 50 years old," Wittberg said. "That's one generation next 
to missing. The next generation, the baby busters, is missing. That's two whole 
generations that are not there." 
</P>
<P>
 As their numbers have decreased, the work falls on older women, the poll 
found. More than two of five nuns (43%) in their 70s were not yet fully 
retired. And although 88% of nuns in their 80s say they are mostly retired, 13% 
were still involved in some form of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked their occupations, a 29% plurality of women religious reported that they 
are retired, and one in four named education as their primary assignment. 
Eighteen percent were administrators, 13% were in community service and 11% in 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts differ on why young women are not joining religious orders. The Rev. 
Andrew W. Greeley, a Catholic sociologist, speculated about several 
possibilities in his book, "The Catholic Myth." They include a sense of 
oppression in the communities, or the "emancipation" of the orders that led to 
a removal of the rigid life that appealed to some members. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, Greeley added, younger women no longer saw anything in the vocations 
of nuns that could not be achieved in lay ministries (even though women 
religious are technically part of the laity). 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, The Times found that among those who are nuns, 87% were 
satisfied with their lives and 60% indicated their lives are better than they 
anticipated. Almost none say their lives are worse. Indeed, 88% of nuns (and 
87% of priests) said they would definitely or probably enter their professions 
again if they had to make the choice. And more than nine in 10 nuns (92%) said 
it is very unlikely they will ever abandon their vocation. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of nuns would favor ordination of women as priests, but few of them 
would take the church up on the offer -- 89% of nuns said they would not seek 
to become priests if the church allowed it. Just 7% of all nuns -- and 5% of 
those dissatisfied with their lives -- probably or definitely would seek 
ordination. Among nuns 50 or younger, 15% would seek ordination, as would 13% 
of nuns who described themselves as liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 In another measure of satisfaction, 85% of nuns said they are comfortable 
going to the superiors of their orders for counsel and guidance. A nearly 
identical 86% said other sisters they meet regularly provide support for their 
vocations. 
</P>
<P>
 The superiors of the orders also received very high approval ratings (87% 
approved, 11% disapproved) from the sisters. A majority of 82% said their 
superiors' moral views were just about right. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the larger church, however, nuns are more critical. By 55% to 
41%, sisters call the church's ministry to lay women inadequate rather than 
adequate. When nuns were asked to name the most important problems facing the 
church in the United States today, sexism and a male-dominated clergy was the 
second most common response (by 18%), just behind the shortage of clergy and 
nuns (22%). 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, nuns felt their status in the church was a little better than 
how priests saw them. Forty-nine percent of priests called the status of nuns 
not so good or poor; 52% of nuns spoke positively of their status. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often priests will come off more liberal than women on those things. 
That's very typical," said Wittberg. She also noted that most nuns are older. 
"If you admitted your extreme powerlessness," Wittberg said, "you'd be 
admitting your whole life was a waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Wittberg also offered another theory. When today's elderly nuns were in their 
prime in pre-Vatican II days, they were in charge of schools and hospitals and 
had little contact with priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "If most priests knew what was good for them, they didn't interfere," she 
said. "It's very possible that a lot of older women, honest to God, did not, in 
their life, experience an inferior position in the church. . . . A lot of these 
women never felt powerless." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-six percent of priests and 53% of nuns consider the church weaker than 
it was 30 years ago, even though at least three in five of both groups felt 
that changes initiated by the Second Vatican Council during the 1960s helped 
the church. A sizable minority (36% for nuns and 28% for priests) said the 
Vatican II reforms have been a mixed blessing. Among the actions that came out 
of Vatican II was greater emphasis on the role of rank-and-file Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an ideological dimension to the level of content or discontent in 
both priests and nuns, Brennan said, with liberals more unhappy over the 
church's status than moderates or conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuns are particularly divided by ideology: Just 32% of religious liberals said 
the church is in good shape, and twice as many (44% versus 20%) said it is 
getting weaker today than stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three of five conservative nuns said things in the church are good, and 
39% thought things are improving rather than getting worse (23%). Younger 
sisters (age 50 or younger) were far more likely to rate church affairs in poor 
shape than are sisters over the age of 70. Twice as many younger nuns thought 
things in the church are getting worse rather than better (41% versus 19%). 
Among sisters over 70, the "better" group exceeded the "worse," 35% to 20%

MONTEREY PARK APARTMENT MANAGER KILLED, SISTER SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tenant of a Monterey Park apartment building allegedly killed the 
40-year-old manager and critically wounded her twin sister Sunday during a 
dispute, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Valdovinos, 38, fled after the shootings and was still at large late 
Sunday.He should be considered armed and dangerous, Monterey Park Police Lt. 
William Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument started shortly before midnight, when Valdovinos, a tenant, went 
to manager Sally Mandeville's apartment in the 16-unit building to discuss what 
witnesses told police was a money-related matter, Young said. Mandeville's twin 
sister, Shirley Mandeville, was also present. 
</P>
<P>
 After the three argued, Valdovinos left the apartment and returned 10 minutes 
later, and a second argument began, Young said. Valdovinos allegedly pulled a 
pistol and shot Sally Mandeville once in the head, and then shot her sister 
once in the head as she tried to run from the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Mandeville died at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, where her 
sister was listed in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities asked that anyone with information about Valdovinos call the 
Monterey Park Police Department or the homicide bureau of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. Valdovinos is 6-feet, 1-inch tall, weighs 200 
pounds, and has brown eyes and dark brown hair. He is believed to have fled in 
a blue Pontiac Bonneville, license number 2ESN922.

CLEMENTINE 1 IS IN ORBIT AROUND MOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clementine 1, a spacecraft on a mapping and military mission, fired its 
thrusters to guide it toward an elliptical orbit around the moon, officials 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had an injection burn Saturday at 7:51 a.m. EST," said Department of 
Defense public affairs officer Major Arne Owens."It was successful and that put 
it into lunar orbit around noon." 
</P>
<P>
 Clementine, which will map the moon and fly by an asteroid while testing 
military sensors, had been in a circular orbit around Earth since it was 
launched Jan. 25 from Vandenberg Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Clementine, built and launched at a cost of $75 million, was assembled by the 
Naval Research Laboratory to test advanced sensors designed for detecting and 
tracking missiles and other lightweight spacecraft components. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensors will be tested by targeting the Earth, moon, the asteroid 
Geographos and a separate device called the Interstage Adapter that was 
launched with Clementine. 
</P>
<P>
 The encounters with the moon and Geographos will also generate scientific data 
for use by civilian scientists.

WEST HILLS MAN ACCIDENTALLY SHOOTS FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old West Hills man showing off a .22-caliber rifle to a group of 
friends Sunday accidentally shot a 17-year-old in the face, critically wounding 
him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified victim, also from West Hills, was taken to Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, where he underwent a CAT scan to determine whether the 
bullet had penetrated his brain, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Jeff Hulet. 
</P>
<P>
 Russel Rayburn, 20, was booked on suspicion of possession of a firearm with an 
obliterated serial number, Hulet said. Possession of such a weapon is a felony, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rayburn was at his parents' house showing the gun to about half a dozen 
friends when the gun went off at about 2:50 p.m., Hulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Rayburn was "horsing around with the rifle," 
pointing it at different people in the room before the accident, Hulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hulet said the wounded teen-ager was shot from a distance of 10 to 12 feet. 
"He's very lucky to be alive."

STUDENT FOUND IN CAR DIED OF STAB WOUNDS 
</P>

By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton honor student whose body was found stuffed in the 
trunk of her car died from multiple stab wounds, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia police spokeswoman Corrine Loomis said further tests are needed on 
the body of Cathy Torrez before a time of death can be determined.Loomis 
declined to say whether a motive or a suspect have been identified in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The family of the 20-year-old woman, who had been missing since Feb. 12, 
issued a statement Sunday, saying: "Whatever happened never should have 
happened. Nobody had a right to take (Cathy) away so young. . . . It would be 
pretty impossible to find a person who didn't like her. To begin to think about 
whoever did this to her is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Torrez, a junior sociology major, was discovered Saturday, a week 
after she vanished after leaving work. Patrol officers found her 1990 burgundy 
Toyota Corolla with the body in the trunk in the Placentia-Linda Community 
Hospital parking lot, but investigators do not know how long the car had been 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has it been determined, officers said, where Torrez encountered her 
attacker. She was last seen about 8 p.m. on Feb. 12 driving alone out of the 
parking lot of the Sav-on Drugstore where she worked part time as a checker. 
</P>
<P>
 Described as a responsible woman who did not like to be out alone, Torrez 
lived with her family and had called her mother only minutes before she left 
work, saying she would be home soon. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said that Torrez had been friends with a young man who had 
tried to kill himself the week before she disappeared, but that they were not 
romantically involved.

KIDNAPED TODDLER FOUND; FATHER ARRESTED; CRIME: THE MAN ALLEGEDLY THREATENED TO 
KILL HIS DAUGHTER UNLESS THE MOTHER PAID $5,000 IN RANSOM. HE IS HELD AFTER

 Los Angeles police on Sunday recovered a toddler allegedly kidnaped in 
Northern California last week by her father, who had threatened to kill the 
child if the mother did not buy her back for $5,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect attempted to lure the mother to meet him in Los Angeles and made 
threats to kill the child and to extort money from the mother," said Sgt. 
Kenneth Lew of the Los Angeles Police Department's Southwest station. "Phone 
calls were traced and made available to the LAPD, and officers acted swiftly 
and closed the case before any tragedy could occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Emilia Michelle Talavera, 22 months, was kidnaped on Valentine's Day by her 
father, Jose Amador Talavera, 25, a known gang member with a criminal record, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had been deported a week earlier after being classified a criminal 
alien, Talavera sneaked back into the country and visited the baby's mother in 
the Sonoma County town of Rohnert Park under the guise of seeing Emilia one 
last time, said Rohnert Park Police Lt. Doug Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that when the mother, Talavera's 22-year-old ex-girlfriend 
Margarita Chivichon, left him alone with the toddler for a moment to get a baby 
bottle, Talavera fled with the child. Over the next week, Talavera allegedly 
placed several phone calls making the ransom demand. The calls were monitored 
and traced to Los Angeles, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talavera threatened to shoot anyone who interfered with him or tried to take 
the baby, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept tracing the calls until we could pinpoint where he was," Smith said. 
Los Angeles police then arrested Talaveras and recovered the child at 12:40 
p.m. Sunday from a house in Southwest Los Angeles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talavera was in custody Sunday, with bail set at $100,000, Smith said. He was 
booked on suspicion of parental child abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the week, police and the Polly Klaas Foundation passed out flyers 
seeking the return of the girl, and faxed copies of it to news media outlets, 
police departments and businesses around the state. After she was recovered 
unharmed, Smith said: "We're feeling great about it. This shows how good 
coordination between police agencies can really make a difference."

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: THE WRITE INVESTMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Olympic ice skater Tonya Harding's prospects for landing lucrative endorsement 
contracts may be limited, what with the lingering questions about her role in 
the attack on teammate Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 But if all else fails, there may be a future in signing her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Sherman, editor of Corona-based Autograph Collector magazine, estimates 
Harding's autograph has doubled in value since she was implicated by her 
ex-husband in the Jan. 6 attack on Kerrigan. Harding denies any role in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman says a Harding signature fetches about $75 now, compared to about $35 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 He says there is usually strong demand for the autographs of Olympic athletes, 
especially when they are combined in a set with other Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
 So what would a set that includes the autograph of both Harding and Kerrigan 
fetch? Sherman estimates $200. Facing Up to the Cost 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt it's going to cost a bundle in rebuilding expenses to put a new face 
on Southern California after January's Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes official word that the cost of building a new face in Southern 
California remains pretty steep. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly Beverly Hills 213 published an all-important plastic surgery 
"Procedure & Cost Update" chart showing that a face lift sets you back $2,500 
to $10,000, nose surgery costs you $2,000 to $5,000, and an eyebrow lift runs 
$1,000 to $3,000 for each side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Face sanding," in which a wire brush is rubbed over your face, is $1,500 to 
$4,000. A "chemical face peel," described as "a controlled burn with a caustic 
solution," is $1,500 to $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A collagen implant, in which cow fat is injected to smooth out wrinkles, is 
$8,000 for the first visit, but only $200 to $500 for each follow-up visit. No 
Welcome Mat Expected 
</P>
<P>
 Stock market short-seller Michael Murphy, whose Overpriced Stock Service 
newsletter routinely trashes California's economy and businesses, must not be 
looking for friends in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In his February newsletter, Murphy, based in Half Moon Bay outside of San 
Francisco, discusses the Northridge earthquake, damage to Southern California's 
freeway system and the impact on Bank of America, a major lender in the 
Antelope Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Developers invented the romantic 'Antelope Valley' name; formerly, this was

DRIVE TOWARD HDTV HITS ANOTHER BUMP; TECHNOLOGY: CRITICS CALL BROADCASTERS' 
PROPOSAL THAT YET ANOTHER TRANSMISSION METHOD BE ANALYZED A DELAYING TACTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Just days after the selection of a technical standard moved high-definition TV 
closer to reality, disgruntled broadcasters are pushing new HDTV proposals that 
threaten to delay the long-awaited technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the Advanced Television Advisory Committee, which oversees 
HDTV's development on behalf of the government, warned the panel that HDTV -- 
under development for nearly a decade -- could be further delayed as a result 
of 11th-hour requests by broadcasters that yet another HDTV transmission 
technique be analyzed before a final decision is made. Proponents of HDTV 
consider this request purely a delaying tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Richard E. Wiley, a Washington lawyer, also said broadcasters have 
succeeded in getting a bill introduced in Congress that would allow them to use 
part of their HDTV signal to earn revenue from data transmission and other, 
non-broadcast, telecommunications services. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory committee had hoped to conclude its work this year and submit its 
HDTV recommendations to the Federal Communications Commission by fall so that 
HDTV could be available by the end of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But the broadcast proposals, said Wiley, "call into question whether our 
effort should proceed as planned or (be) altered in some manner." Wiley, whose 
law firm has one of the largest communications practices in the country and 
counts CBS and many other broadcasters among its clients, indicated that the 
FCC may have to take up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts estimate that each of the nation's 1,600 TV stations will spend more 
than $1 million to prepare transmitters and studio equipment for HDTV, and 
millions more on preparing programming in the new HDTV format. 
</P>
<P>
 To offset those costs, broadcast industry lobbyists have been pressing 
lawmakers to let them delay the introduction of HDTV and allow them to use part 
of the HDTV signal for non-broadcast telecommunications services that could 
compete with providers such as telephone companies and cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry and consumer hopes have been riding high on HDTV, an advanced 
television technology that will provide a sharper and wider picture as well as 
compact disc-quality sound. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the three groups that had been vying to develop a proprietary system 
to serve as the U.S. standard for HDTV formed an alliance to pool their 
expertise and share any royalties arising from the new technology. Two 
transmission methods were recently tested and on Wednesday the HDTV alliance 
chose Zenith's, subject to the advisory committee's review and approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have estimated that HDTV could generate as many as 100,000 U.S. 
manufacturing jobs. Further evidence of HDTV's importance came when Zenith 
Electronics Corp. shares jumped 13% on the New York Stock Exchange after the 
company's transmission system was given preliminary industry endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 But broadcasters have become increasingly concerned about the costs of 
switching to HDTV as well as whether enough consumers will shell out the 
estimated $2,000 to $3,000 for an HDTV set. 
</P>
<P>
 John D. Abel, an executive vice president at the National Assn. of 
Broadcasters, who is the group's expert on HDTV, could not be reached Friday. 
But in a statement released by his office, Abel said that because HDTV is an 
expensive and untested technology, broadcasters needed more flexibility in 
bringing it to market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role of broadcasting will be even further constrained if we cannot be 
full-digital multimedia providers in tomorrow's world, and the American 
consumer will be worse off because they will end up paying huge sums of money 
to telephone and cable companies for these services," the statement said.

STATE LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TO LURE TOURISTS; MEDIA: OFFICIALS HOPE HIGH-TECH TV 
SPOTS WILL REPLACE RECENT IMAGES OF FIRES AND EARTHQUAKE WITH UPBEAT REPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Disasters be damned. State tourism officials are striving to shake up more 
business with California's first-ever national ad campaign. And there's a 
high-tech twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Two national TV spots, which will both begin to air today, promise "instant" 
information on the Golden State sent via fax to tourists who dial a toll-free 
number. No other state now offers such a service, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Curious out-of-towners who want to make immediate vacation plans -- without 
waiting weeks for mailed brochures to arrive -- can now request information and 
within minutes will be faxed several pages of suggested travel outings in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign will air on the same TV screens that just one month ago shocked 
viewers across the country with brutal scenes of destruction from the 
Northridge earthquake that killed 57, injured 16,500 and caused more than $2.5 
billion in damage to property that was insured. Images of the Malibu, Altadena 
and Laguna Beach fires and floods -- and well as the 1992 Los Angeles riots -- 
are also still fresh in minds of many potential tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism officials don't pretend this $3-million campaign will change all that. 
But they are hopeful that the upbeat image it portrays of the state can begin 
to turn around years of continuous decline in market share from California's 
annual $53-billion tourism industry. They're doing it with ads filled with 
happy talk -- and striking imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't speak to your negatives in advertising," said John Poimiroo, 
director of the California Division of Tourism in Sacramento. "It would be 
crazy to say, 'Hey we just had an earthquake, but we're fine now.' You talk 
about your benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Past campaigns have generally promoted different regions of the state. But 
researchers from the Los Angeles and San Francisco offices of the ad agency J. 
Walter Thompson discovered that potential tourists are far more interested in 
learning about specific types of vacation options in California rather than 
getting state geography lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads flash California images for four specific vacation concepts: family 
fun, romantic getaways, nature outings and sports adventures. Viewers are asked 
to dial (800) GO-CALIF to immediately receive customized faxes on any of those 
four vacation categories. People without access to fax machines will be mailed 
brochures within two weeks, Poimiroo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole campaign hinges on instant information," said David Bigman, group 
creative director at J. Walter Thompson's San Francisco office. "It's like 
having an uncle in California who you can call to find out the latest things 
there are to do in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 While Los Angeles tourism officials say they are very impressed with the ad 
campaign, they say it will likely take much more than that to bring tourists 
flocking back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Local tourism suffered an estimated $308-million blow after the Northridge 
earthquake, according to one report prepared by the Los Angeles accounting firm 
Pannell Kerr Forster just days after the earthquake. But the firm now believes 
the impact may be substantially smaller, and it plans to repeat the study later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a massive national ad campaign, which could cost in excess of $25 
million, can help quickly turn around the city's battered image and bolster 
tourism, said Michael Collins, senior vice president at the Los Angeles 
Convention & Visitors Bureau. In fact, a state task force on financing tourism 
promotion recently proposed that the industry voluntarily tax itself to raise 
the funds.

 New York State's highest court has upheld the right to charge a sales tax at 
coin-operated sex peep show booths.The legal dispute stems from the defunct 
Times Square 1605 Book Center Inc., which contested a tax ruling in 1980 
assessing $141,686.11. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was based on two shows, including one in which nude or partly naked 
women performed before a private booth. The other, the "fantasy booth," allowed 
a patron to converse with a scantily clad woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's lawyer said he could take the case into federal court. 
"They've never gone after video games. It's only because of the nature of the 
business."

 France's Groupe Bull May Sell Stock to Employees: Jean-Marie Descarpentries, 
chairman of the money-losing, state-owned computer maker, said he would like to 
allocate 15% to 20% of Bull's shares to employees, while allowing two or three 
outside partners to buy 10% to 15% each.Japan's NEC Corp. already owns about 5% 
of Bull's parent company and was cited as a possible candidate. IBM owns 2%. 
The French state owns or controls the rest.

 Drug Abuse on the Job Declines Again, Study Says: The figures declined for the 
sixth straight year, according to the latest data from SmithKline Beechman 
Clinical Laboratories, but it is still a huge problem. The SmithKline Beechman 
Drug Testing Index, a gauge of positive drug tests in the workplace, declined 
to 8.41% in 1993, the lowest level in the past decade, from 8.76% in 1992. The 
decline is due largely to "the heightened focus on education and employee 
assistance programs," said Tobey Dichter of SmithKlein, which conducted more 
than 3 million drug tests last year.

 Mexican Trade Deficit Shrinks: The 1993 trade deficit dropped to $13.5 
billion, 15.1% lower than a year earlier, the treasury ministry announced.The 
decrease in the shortfall had been expected and was mainly the result of lower 
growth in imports. Imports, which skyrocketed 24.3% in 1992, rose 5.2% last 
year. No reason was given for the import slowdown. However, the government 
launched a vigorous anti-dumping enforcement campaign last year, which affected 
an array of Chinese products and U.S. steel.

 Swiss Ban Foreign Trucks: In a referendum, 52% of the voters approved a 
proposal to force all truck trailers crossing Switzerland between northern and 
southern Europe to be shipped by railroad within 10 years. Trucks carrying 
goods to or from Switzerland and domestic traffic will be exempt. The outcome 
was a stinging rebuke to the four-party governing coalition, which had argued 
the ban would violate international transport treaties and "provoke politically 
and economically harmful retaliation from abroad."

 Exxon Unit Wins Damages From Lubrizol: A federal judge more than doubled 
damages against Cleveland-based Lubrizol Corp. to $129 million for infringing 
on a 1989 Exxon Chemical Co. patent for a motor oil additive. U.S. District 
Judge Norman Black entered the award for Exxon after reviewing a jury award of 
$48 million, made last November.A Lubrizol spokesman said the company was 
disappointed and would appeal the judge's ruling. At issue was a copper 
component used in motor oil mixtures sold to oil companies. After the December, 
1992, verdict, Lubrizol removed the copper component from its additive 
packages.

 Monsanto Sues Dairy for Boycotting Genetic Drug: In what appears to be the 
first return-fire in the battle over a genetically engineered drug for cows, 
the St. Louis-based company filed suit last week against Swiss Valley Farms, an 
Iowa cooperative that refuses to buy milk from farmers who treat their cows 
with Monsanto's Posilac.The drug is designed to increase milk production. 
Monsanto's suit claims the dairy's advertised pledge not to accept milk from 
cows treated with the controversial drug "impugns the safety and wholesomeness" 
of milk. Even though the Food and Drug Administration has declared the drug 
safe, opponents are waging a campaign to discourage farmers from using it.

 Fed Chief Opposes a Single Bank Regulator: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan shares the Clinton Administration's goal of reducing regulatory costs 
but not its proposal for placing banks under a single regulator, he told the 
annual convention of the Independent Bankers Assn. of America. The supervisory 
structure needs to become more efficient and accountable but should not 
jeopardize the regulatory hierarchy, Greenspan said. Clinton has proposed a 
sweeping overhaul of regulatory agencies that would fold the supervisory 
functions of four agencies, including the Fed, into a single Federal Banking 
Commission.

 Delta Said to Eye No-Frills Service: The No. 3-ranked U.S. airline is 
considering the option for routes under 600 miles as a way of meeting 
competition from low-cost rivals such as ValuJet Inc., the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution reported. The newspaper said Delta's strategic planning 
director, Hiram Cox, is putting together a theoretical no-frills plan.The 
no-frills concept has led the carrier to inform new flight attendants that they 
must be willing to work in any such operation. The idea would be to cut costs 
enough on short routes to ensure that Delta can still make money while charging 
fares as low as ValuJet's or those offered by Continental Airlines' CALite. The 
newspaper noted that while Delta already is matching the fares of no-frills 
rivals, the tactic is likely to cause a drag on the airline's finances unless 
costs also are brought down.

WHO'S KEEPING UP WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY?; ATTITUDES: THOUGH MANY FEEL LEFT BEHIND, 
MORE THAN HALF IN SURVEY ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Almost half of U.S. adults and a majority of those over the age of 35 say the 
advance of technology is leaving them behind, according to an Associated Press 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows widespread agreement that computers and electronic devices have 
made life easier, and 57% of the respondents say they are satisfied with their 
level of technical know-how. But even among the satisfied, three in 10 people 
say they feel left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who say they are not keeping up, half have used a computer at a job 
and 31% have used a computer in their home. Two-thirds of that group are 
dissatisfied with their level of technical know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 What they say they are most lacking to better keep up with technology is 
knowledge (36%), money (24%) and time (21%). A smaller share, 16%, say they 
lack the desire to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, those who think they are technologically adept are most likely 
to cite money as what they need to continue to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those in the poll, 59%, say they have used a computer at a job, and 
42% have used one at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic variation in the results is among those who say computers 
and electronics have made life easier -- 63% overall, 71% of those under age 
45, and 35% of those over 65. Only 9% think electronics made life harder; the 
rest think it's the same. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority, 53%, say they are keeping up with technology, and 46% say they are 
being left behind. Fewer than 1% are uncertain. Just over half of those past 
age 35 feel left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups most likely to say they are keeping up are men, those with family 
incomes over $50,000 a year, people in metropolitan areas and, of course, 
people who have used computers. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of respondents under 65 have used a computer at work, but the 
percentage who have used a computer at home varies from 57% of those under 35 
to 34% of those ages 55 to 64 and 11% of those over 65. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid excluding computer enthusiasts who tie up their phones with on-line 
services, the poll had up to four callbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press poll on technological change was taken Feb. 9 through 13 
among a random sample of 1,002 adult Americans in all states except Alaska and 
Hawaii. Interviewing was done by telephone by ICR Survey Research Group of 
Media, Pa., part of AUS Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were weighted to represent the population by key demographic 
factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
 No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the sample cause the 
results to vary by more than 3 percentage points from the answers that would be 
obtained if all Americans were polled. This margin of sampling error is larger 
for responses of subgroups, such as age categories. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and 
order of questions.

 Singapore Bans Violent Video Games: The arts ministry said it will tighten 
regulations on imported video games and has ordered dealers to remove two 
games, Mortal Kombat and Night Trap, from their shelves because of excessive 
violence. Starting March 1, video games dealers will have to obtain import 
permits from the board before distributing games in Singapore, the ministry 
said.

ANTI-SMOKING GROUPS FIRED UP OVER CAMEL ADS; TOBACCO: CAMPAIGN FEATURING FEMALE 
CHARACTERS CALLED RECKLESS FOR TARGETING WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Camel, the dashing dromedary under fire from anti-smoking groups for 
appealing to youths, has some new lady friends. And his critics aren't pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Ads featuring the cartoon camels began running this week in magazines 
including Redbook, Glamour, People, Us and Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-color spreads show female camels holding lit Camels around the bar, 
pool table and dance floor at Joe's Place, a watering hole for the fictional 
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. character. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that the sole purpose of the new ad campaign is to attract 
women smokers to Camel, a brand normally associated with male smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reckless and dangerous campaign to lure more young female smokers into 
the fatal confines of Joe's Place," said Sidney Wolfe, director of health 
research for the advocacy group Public Citizen in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned that by making a female Joe Camel, it's going to have an 
effect on girls smoking," said Michael Eriksen, director of the office on 
smoking and health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 RJR spokeswoman Maura Ellis seemed surprised by the attention the new ads are 
getting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ad was not targeted to female smokers; it was intended for all smokers of 
competitive brands," she said from RJR's headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C. 
"It seems illogical to use a nightclub and not have a mix of male and female 
camels." 
</P>
<P>
 Eriksen said he was intrigued by the timing of the new ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's surprising that they've done this because the Federal Trade Commission 
is looking at the Joe Camel advertisements now to see whether they should be 
regulated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown boys are about 50% more likely than girls to smoke Camels. 
Before Joe Camel, in the mid-1970s and late 1980s, girls were smoking more than 
boys, Eriksen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now its reversed, he said, because of Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said the ads are an affront to efforts by anti-smoking groups to 
persuade the FTC to ban the Joe Camel character. The FTC staff recommended a 
ban last summer, but the commissioners have not yet issued a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sooner the camels are put to rest, the sooner more Americans, especially 
young men and women, will live instead of die," Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said female camels have been featured at least once before with Joe 
Camel, who has been in trouble with anti-smoking advocates almost since he was 
introduced as the "smooth character" in ads for Camel cigarettes in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies published by the Journal of the American Medical Assn. have found the 
camel's image was as familiar to 6-year-olds as Mickey Mouse. Meanwhile, Joe 
Camel has become the brand of choice for about one-third of smokers under age 
18, the journal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry continues to insist that there is no proof the ads 
influence young people to smoke Camels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every study will show the overwhelming influence on kids who start smoking is 
peer pressure and family influences," Ellis said. "Children from homes where 
their parents are smokers tend to have a higher (smoking) rate. And since these 
ads have been in place, the number of kids who smoke has continued to decline." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said the real intent of the ads was to lure Marlboro smokers over to 
Camel. Marlboro, made by RJR rival Philip Morris, owns a dominant 26.6% share 
of the U.S. cigarette market. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Camels are the choice of about 4% of the nation's smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe Joe Camel has been a disproportionate lightning rod," Ellis said. 
"After all, we're talking about a brand with 4% of the market. That means 96% 
of smokers in the country smoke other brands. We think Camel has been unfairly 
singled out."

 Airport Financing Expected to Dominate Budget: The colony's annual budget 
statement is likely to be dominated by attempts to resolve the Sino-British 
dispute over Hong Kong's $20-billion airport project, tax experts say. China 
and Britain have been haggling over how to pay for the project, which includes 
new roads, railways and bridges, tunnels and major reclamation work on Hong 
Kong's Victoria Harbor. Beijing is concerned that Hong Kong, which reverts to 
Chinese sovereignty in 1997, will be left with a large debt burden as a result 
of the project.

 Kerr-McGee, Partners Plan Project: Kerr-McGee Corp. is getting a 35% interest 
in a petroleum exploration project in the South Con Son Basin off the shore of 
Vietnam. "The lifting of the embargo on Vietnam by the U.S. government has 
permitted this venture, which is a continuation of Kerr-McGee's strategy to 
expand into international basins with the potential for large discoveries," 
said Luke R. Corbett, group vice president for the Oklahoma City-based energy 
company. Kerr-McGee entered an agreement with Cairn Energy and Secab Ltd., two 
British companies, in which it received the 35% interest.

FOR CHINA'S NEW RICH, WHAT GLITTERS IS PLATINUM; WEALTH: JEWELRY MADE OF THE 
METAL APPEALS TO CITY DWELLERS, WHO THINK IT IS CLASSIER THAN GOLD.

<P>
 What do you buy when you already have French suits, Italian leather shoes, a 
gold watch and your own car? 
</P>
<P>
 For China's growing upper class, it's platinum jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the message at Da Ming, a glitzy new jewelry shop on Wangfujing, 
Beijing's main shopping street, when it opened on Christmas Day with a 
front-counter display of platinum rings encased by diamonds -- at a cost of up 
to $1,150. 
</P>
<P>
 "Platinum appeals to a higher class of people, better educated, and the new 
rich who already have gold jewelry and want more," said Chen Qiang, the shop's 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He said sales so far have been for less expensive platinum items -- up to 
$230, still almost the average annual income for an urban resident of China in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is the same at the other jewelry stores on Wangfujing that have 
sprung up in part to cater to people concerned that their money will lose value 
amid China's high urban inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started selling platinum jewelry several months ago," a saleswoman at one 
shop said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeals to young, rich city men who think it is classier than gold. They 
like the fact that many people do not know how valuable it is, which appeals to 
their sense of exclusiveness. And designs are improving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only city people buy platinum. Rural people all buy gold. And if you are 
giving a present, it is safer to give gold jewelry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold jewelry sells in most shops for about $121 an ounce, compared to $560 for 
platinum. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum was trading at about $388 an 
ounce. Its price fluctuates, like that of gold, because of factors such as 
international turmoil and political unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry is a major user of platinum for catalytic converters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese, suspicious of paper money, have for centuries bought gold as an 
investment. But platinum has gained popularity as some Chinese become rich 
enough to look beyond gold. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chinese, platinum is "white gold," an auspicious name. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the China Jewelry Import & Export Corp. said the market for 
platinum jewelry remains limited, although he gave no figures. China does not 
publish figures on platinum production or sales. 
</P>
<P>
 At Da Ming, Chen said, "gold jewelry still sells better than platinum." 
</P>
<P>
 But platinum sales have been fueled by the growth in the number of what 
ordinary Chinese call da kuan (fat cats), who think nothing of spending several 
hundred yuan -- a month's income for a Beijing resident -- on a single lunch at 
a high-class restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because it is worth more than gold and because it is still 
exclusive," said a businessman in his 30s who was buying a platinum ring. "Many 
people do not know how valuable it is." 
</P>
<P>
 An official survey published in November found that the richest 3% of the 
population in China had more money in the bank ($33.7 billion) than all of the 
nation's 900 million farmers, who have deposits of only $31.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 According to official figures, the average urban citizen last year earned 
about $264; his cousin in the countryside earned $97. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the urban fat cats are entrepreneurs or work for companies with good 
official connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly uncomfortable with this disparity, the Communist Party has said 
that its final objective is prosperity for all. But in the short term, it says, 
it is acceptable for a small number of people to become rich first, like 
pioneers blazing a trail to the promised land. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But platinum jewelry did not impress one cynical Beijing taxi driver who 
admitted to earning $230 for a seven-day week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is only for people who have too much money and do not know what to do 
with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why buy an imported French suit when you can buy a good Chinese one for a 
tenth of the price? They buy it just to show off," he said. "And we have people 
in China who do not have enough to eat or wear."

 Bankruptcy Debt Climbs: Debt from bankrupt companies surged in January, with 
businesses increasingly unable to make ends meet as the recession grinds on, a 
debt research company said. Debt from business failures rose 53.1% from 
December's figure, to $4.16 billion, while their number rose 17.9% to 1,104, 
Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co. said. January showed increases in 
bankruptcies for construction, manufacturing and retail businesses compared 
with a year ago.

NEW FUND SEES INDUSTRY RESURGENCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Ernest Mysogland has things figured out right, you'll be hearing a lot more 
about the comeback of industrial America. 
</P>
<P>
 Mysogland maintains that old-line U.S. smokestack companies like the Big Three 
auto manufacturers have embarked on more than just a temporary upswing in their 
long-flagging fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 He has set up the portfolio of the new mutual fund he manages to try to 
benefit from their resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicken Little was wrong. The sky is not falling," declares the 51-year-old 
Mysogland, echoing the sentiments of the bovine statuette labeled "Ernie the 
Bull" that sits beside his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the holdings of the NWNL Northstar Income and Growth Fund, which began 
operations in November and now has more than $50 million in assets, are the 
stocks of the Big Three car manufacturers. In a portfolio of 48% stocks, 28% 
bonds, 20% convertible securities and 4% cash equivalents, General Motors 
represent the single biggest position. 
</P>
<P>
 "This epitomizes everything that is going well in the United States," 
Mysogland says. "Instead of not being able to compete, we are clobbering Japan. 
We export more of our gross domestic product than Japan."

JEWELRY INDUSTRY SEES BIG TURNAROUND IN SALES; GEMS: AS ECONOMY IMPROVES, 
CONSUMERS FIND ITS POLITICALLY CORRECT ONCE AGAIN TO WEAR FINE STONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sparkle has returned to the jewelry industry after years of lackluster 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 An improved economy, repeal of the luxury tax and new marketing options, such 
as home shopping on television, are behind the turnaround, which began a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the confidence in wearing jewelry is coming back," said Simon Teakle, 
who heads the U.S. jewelry division of Christie's auction house, where 1993 
sales rose 25% over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In recessionary times, it wasn't socially correct to wear a tremendous amount 
of jewelry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teakle says consumers are not only buying more baubles and bangles, but have 
become more savvy about what's available. Many may know, for instance, that the 
finest red rubies come from Burma, that Mexican opals are fiery orange and that 
diamonds occur naturally in nearly every color of the rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet distinguishing a ruby from a red spinel, an emerald from a garnet, or even 
10-karat gold from 14-karat gold can be extremely difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 This lack of expertise -- along with the availability of lab-grown synthetics 
and imitations resembling the real thing -- can leave the average buyer 
vulnerable to unscrupulous dealers and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every color you like, there are probably five or six gemstones in that 
color," said Antoinette L. Matlins, co-author of "Jewelry & Gems, The Buying 
Guide." "What you see with the naked eye may not be reality when you buy gems 
and jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
 Also making jewelry buying difficult is that such purchases often are anchored 
by emotions, particularly during holidays like Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Avenue is largely responsible. Advertising campaigns portray diamonds 
and other gems as the ultimate gift of eternal love. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful of these campaigns comes from the De Beers' cartel, which 
markets 80% of the world's diamonds. De Beers has successfully perpetuated the 
illusion of the diamond as a rare and valuable stone. In reality, diamonds are 
plentiful but tightly distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous exploitation of consumers based on the allure of 
gemstones and the mythology of them," Matlins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone on the TV shopping network may mention diamonds or rubies or 
sapphires or emeralds and a certain image instantly comes to mind . . . of a 
highly valuable jewel. But in fact, it doesn't escape the fact that it could be 
garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 Steffan Aletti, president of the Jewelry Industry Council in New York, said he 
has received few complaints about the discounted jewelry sold on home-shopping 
programs. But he acknowledges that some dealers do misrepresent what they sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some emeralds that are more appropriate to grace the bottom of a 
fishbowl than a ring," he said. "The more desperate people are in looking for a 
deal, the most likely they are to get stung." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One way to avoid getting stung is to shop reputable dealers who have trade 
group affiliations and experts on their payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need to be a gemologist to buy a ring," Aletti said, "just as you 
don't need to study a schematic to buy a Sony or a Panasonic" television set. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some basic rules to keep in mind when buying jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 For diamonds, size is not the most important factor. Diamonds are graded and 
priced based on the cut, color, clarity and carat weight, with a flawless, 
colorless stone considered the most valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-carat, round-cut diamond that is nearly flawless and with excellent 
color can cost far more than a three-carat diamond of poor color and with 
noticeable imperfections -- about $13,400 versus $7,200, Matlins' book says. 
Fancy shapes usually sell for 5% to 15% less. 
</P>
<P>
 Matlins says the four rules for gemstones are "color, color, color and color!" 
</P>
<P>
 If a gemstone's color is good, she says, the presence of flaws usually won't 
detract from its value as significantly as with diamonds. Keep in mind, 
however, that many stones are treated with heat or oils to enhance their color, 
a process that is legal as long as the dealer discloses that to the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The availability of the stone also is crucial. A chrome tourmaline may have a 
color similar to a green zircon, but because there's less supply, the 
tourmaline costs more -- about $300 to $1,400 for one to three carats versus 
$240 to $680 for the zircon, says "Jewelry & Gems." 
</P>
<P>
 Precious metals vary in price based on their purity. Sterling silver costs 
more than silver plate. An 18-karat gold setting is more valuable than 14-karat 
or 10-karat because it contains more gold -- 75%, vs. 58% and 41%. Platinum is 
costlier still because it is rarer and heavier than the others.  
</P>
<P>
 The standard markup for retail jewelers is about 100% above the wholesale 
price, said Aletti, though it can go higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are willing to sell more and make less. . . . Some want more per sale. 
It depends on the overhead the jeweler has," Aletti said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tiffany and Cartier have a higher markup because of their enormous overhead. 
But they sell only the very best of materials." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the huge markups, along with the difficulty most individuals have 
in reselling pieces, jewelry should not be thought of as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The material from which it's made has to go up a great deal for you to 
realize any kind of profit," Aletti said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's especially true of diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are thousands of categories of diamonds. Some are more easily sold than 
others," said Lloyd Jaffe, chairman of the American Diamond Industry Assn. 
"(And) no stone will have the same emotional value for one person as the next." 
Buyer Beware 
</P>
<P>
 Some tips for buying jewelry: 
</P>
<P>
 * Select a reputable dealer. Suggestions from family or friends may be 
helpful. Otherwise, visit several stores and compare the quality of products, 
prices and services. Is there a gemologist on staff? Have there been any 
complaints to the Better Business Bureau? 
</P>
<P>
 * Beware of bogus sales. Some dealers constantly hold "70% off" sales, but you 
don't know what they're discounting from if the promotions don't end. A sale is 
a true sale if the merchandise is discounted for a period of time, then 
returned to the higher, regular price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put it in writing. A purchase should be described in a bill of sale just as 
it was explained by the salesperson. For diamonds, the carat weight, color and 
flaw grades should be noted. For colored gemstones, it should be stated whether 
the stone is genuine or synthetic, among other things. Some dealers may make a 
sale contingent on verification by a gem-testing lab. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get an independent appraisal. Besides verifying facts about the piece, an 
appraisal is needed for insurance. Trade groups such as the American Gem 
Society in Los Angeles can provide lists of appraisers. Auction houses such as 
Christie's in New York also offer free verbal appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get insurance. Since standard homeowners' policies cover only a portion of 
jewelry losses, additional coverage is needed. But not all policies are equal. 
For instance, many companies won't reimburse the "full value" of the item but 
rather exercise a "replacement" option. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beware of telemarketers. Gemstone investments can be profitable, but 
millions of dollars have been lost in sophisticated telemarketing schemes. The 
pitch may seem legitimate: Gems offered at "wholesale prices" and shipped in 
sealed containers with convincing reports from gem-testing labs.

 How can you complain about bad jewelry deals? 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewelers Vigilance Committee and local Better Business Bureau are two 
groups that can help with complaints against jewelry dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each may intervene on your behalf, though both suggest trying to work things 
out with the retailer first. 
</P>
<P>
 The BBB said it received 1,810 complaints nationwide in 1992, the latest year 
for which data is available. Of those, 85% were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee said it resolved nearly two-thirds of the 400 complaints it 
handled last year. The biggest concern: false pricing and phony sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Windham, the committee's general counsel, said individuals should 
document their cases with copies of invoices, sales receipts or appraiser's 
reports. All complaints must be put in writing. Mail them to the Jewelers 
Vigilance Committee, 401 E. 34th St., Suite N13A, New York, NY 10016.

DESPITE WALL STREET BOOM, INVESTMENT COMPANIES' STOCKS ARE DOWN IN PRICE; 
SECURITIES: ANALYSTS BLAME RISING INTEREST RATES, ALONG WITH THE MEMORY OF 
BROKERAGES PEAKING EARLY IN PAST BULL MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Wall Street is booming these days, you couldn't tell it from the 
action in most securities industry stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of the leading publicly traded investment firms have fallen 15% to 30% 
lately from the record highs they reached last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts their prices at miserly ratios as low as six, seven or eight times 
the firms' most recent 12 months earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of Merrill Lynch, by far the biggest firm on the Street and a 
company that recently reported a record profit of $1.36 billion for last year, 
representing a gain of better than 50% from a very healthy 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Its stock, which was split 2 for 1 in late '93, recently traded around $43, 
down from an adjusted high of $51.125 last fall. It is going for just seven 
times Merrill's 1993 earnings per share of $5.98. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that multiple, the market appears to be saying that one of the decade's 
most powerful themes is being valued on the basis of a commodity cyclical whose 
earnings are in the process of peaking," says David Shulman, investment 
strategist at Salomon Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevailing view among traders in brokerage stocks seems clear: After a big 
run since 1990 in their earnings and stock prices, the securities industry has 
about had it for this business cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 That inference isn't drawn from the underwriting calendars of investment 
bankers, which are still bulging with deals on the heels of a blockbuster year 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, analysts say, it derives partly from the upswing in interest rates 
since last fall, and partly from memories of past bull markets in which 
brokerage stocks peaked very early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 If interest rates are headed for a sustained rise, they could squeeze brokers' 
profits in a variety of ways -- for instance, by shrinking opportunities for 
profits on the firms' bond trading desks, and perhaps by slowing the growth of 
the mutual fund business. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, experience has taught many investors to treat securities 
industry stocks as hot potatoes. By way of illustration, the high point for 
Merrill's stock in the 1980s came in 1983, scarcely a year after the bull 
market began. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers argue that people who keep to that trading mentality may be 
missing a bet this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If U.S. investment banks were tied solely to the U.S. market, then the end of 
the bull market in U.S. bonds might well signal the end of the upward trend for 
these stocks," says Steven Eisman, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, over the past few years, select firms have become the most powerful 
worldwide distributors of financial products. Such firms wield strong 
franchises not only in the U.S., but in Europe and emerging markets as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opportunities in Europe and emerging markets should lengthen this profit 
cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, there is the much-proclaimed shift among Americans in the 1990s 
away from spending and toward saving as the population ages. If this purported 
trend is actually happening, brokers would stand to reap long-term benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shulman's view, however, the recent pressure on Merrill and other brokerage 
stocks is not to be dismissed so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it (Merrill Lynch stock) does not rally soon," he says, "the message it is 
sending is especially ominous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stated bluntly, if Merrill Lynch is priced right, then the Standard & Poor's 
500 index is expensive. Alternatively, if the S&P 500 is right, then Merrill 
Lynch is cheap at current levels."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: GLOBE-TROTTER FLAGS EMERGING-MARKETS WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're wondering what's going to happen next in the world's emerging stock 
markets, you might want to listen to what Mark Mobius is saying. 
</P>
<P>
 As a top international equity manager for the Templeton Group, one of the more 
foreign-looking fund families, Mobius just might be the ultimate global 
tire-kicker. He logs about 100,000 miles a year in search of promising stocks, 
primarily in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 A German citizen born on Long Island who studied in Massachusetts, New Mexico 
and Wisconsin, Mobius now calls both Hong Kong and Singapore home. He has lived 
in the Far East since 1965 -- 2 1/2 decades before most mutual fund companies 
got an emerging-markets glint in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 This cosmopolitan exposure has put Mobius, who's proficient in several 
languages, in a good position to spot promising companies in developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few weeks ago, his $1.6-billion Templeton Developing Markets Trust was 
the largest mutual fund of its type, although it has since been eclipsed by 
Fidelity Emerging Markets. All told, Mobius oversees $4.8 billion of assets 
invested in less-developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
 This is his analysis of where the next big winners might or might not emerge: 
</P>
<P>
 * Vietnam. With the recent move to normalize relations between Washington and 
Hanoi, this country's commercial potential has suddenly been thrust to the 
forefront. However, it's still too early to start thinking about Vietnam as an 
investment play, Mobius says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Vietnamese are setting up a stock exchange, they are several 
years away from having a market of any size. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't run a Vietnam fund with one or two stocks," says Mobius, who visited 
the country last year. "We need 100 investments, traded and valued daily." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest industrial firms are state-owned and have yet to be privatized. 
Another problem is government control over foreign-exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The day when a mutual fund can invest in Vietnam is farther down the road than 
many Americans think, Mobius says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eastern Europe. Russia so far has been a problem for several reasons. One 
concern is that banks in the country might be unable to safeguard a fund's 
stock certificates and cash from pilferage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole infrastructure that's required to invest in (emerging) 
markets," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Mobius has already started to buy shares in former 
state-owned enterprises in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Africa. Mobius is excited about the continent's potential. Africans have an 
entrepreneurial spirit, and more governments are starting to embrace 
capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "A privatization wave is sweeping the world, because it works," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mobius' funds have few holdings in Africa, primarily because most 
markets there are very small. He figures Africa as an investment destination of 
any significance might still be a decade away. 
</P>
<P>
 * India. The world's second-most-populous nation will eventually emerge as one 
of the world's largest stock markets, Mobius predicts. A large middle class, a 
democratic tradition, the prevalence of English and decent economic growth all 
bode well for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, India poses numerous problems for fund managers, including 
the fact that its creaky financial infrastructure has been marred by recent 
corruption scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 With billions of new investment dollars flooding in lately, the system has 
been overwhelmed, Mobius says. This has allowed mistakes, and crooks, to 
proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
 "These old paper-based (trading) systems just can't handle the volume," he 
says. Other emerging nations also have this type of problem, but Mobius 
considers it worse in India. 
</P>
<P>
 * Latin America. "The dream of an economically and culturally unified Western 
Hemisphere is drawing closer," says Mobius. Already, the United States is 
showing greater interest south of the border -- as evidenced by the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, he figures the region's largest country, Brazil, looms as 
the most attractive investment market. It's a huge country with vast resources. 
Other favorites include Mexico and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're very excited about the whole region," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * China. For the past year or two, China has been the biggest emerging-markets 
story. That's not going to change, Mobius says. 
</P>
<P>
 "China has a long ways to go regarding economic development and the number of 
new companies coming to market," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Mobius, who has a doctorate in economics and political science, doesn't think 
China's political uncertainties will derail the economic progress, noting that 
Singapore has prospered as a one-party state. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a decade, he expects to see a diverse array of publicly traded 
companies on Chinese stock exchanges. Further down the road, the country's 
stock market will eclipse Japan's as the largest in Asia, he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 As for emerging markets in general, Mobius thinks it's important for investors 
to retain a long-term focus, since so many foreign bourses are highly volatile. 
Already this year, prices have corrected big time in Turkey, Venezuela and 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors have to be ready for both good times and bad, and that means having 
the resolve to keep sending us money even when prices are going down." 
</P>
<P>

 An expanded "Investor's Guide to Low-Cost Mutual Funds" is now available for 
$5 from the Mutual Fund Education Alliance. The directory provides phone 
numbers, expense ratios, performance figures and other information on 700 funds 
offered by 32 primarily no-load families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance ((816) 471-1454) can be reached at 1900 Erie St., Suite 120, 
Kansas City, MO 64116.

</P>
<P>
 Much has been said and written about banks losing assets to mutual funds, but 
the trend seems to be weakening. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank outflows into mutual funds slowed during 1993, says Jeffrey M. Schaefer, 
a senior vice president at the Securities Industry Assn. in New York. Despite 
low yields, he predicts a $1.1-trillion core of time deposits will probably 
remain at banking institutions. 
</P>

 During last year's fourth quarter, 59.3% of the funds were subsidizing all or 
a portion of their expenses in an effort to retain shareholders, reports 
IBC/Donoghue Inc. in Ashland, Mass. That's up from 56.5% in the third quarter 
of 1993 and 42.9% in late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should short-term rates continue to remain at these low levels in the coming 
year, money funds will surely continue to slash expenses to deter investors 
from venturing elsewhere," the company says. Leading Emerging-Markets Funds

MCDONALD'S FINDING SUCCESS IN MIDEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 McDonald's Corp. says it is surpassing expectations in its bid to export its 
fast-food restaurants to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 James Skinner, senior vice president in charge of Middle East development, 
declined to disclose sales figures or say how long after its opening a Middle 
East restaurant begins to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 That McDonald's is doing well there is no surprise to analysts familiar with 
the company's success exporting its finely tuned fast-food delivery system to 
countries as diverse as Russia, Thailand and China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a single market where they haven't done a bang-up job," said 
Allan Hickok, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ultimately think they will end up colonizing the world with the Big Mac." 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening its first restaurant in Tel Aviv last fall, the Oak Brook, 
Ill.-based fast-food giant has opened others in the Saudia Arabian cities of 
Riyadh and Jeddah. 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to open a second outlet in Tel Aviv this week and a 
restaurant in Oman in March. Restaurants are scheduled for Kuwait in June and 
Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Egypt in November. One in Qatar is expected 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, McDonald's expects to have 25 restaurants in the region by the end of 
1994, Skinner said. Worldwide, the company had nearly 14,000 restaurants at the 
end of 1993. Of those, 4,710 were outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner said its Middle East expansion represents the first new foreign market 
McDonald's has entered in several years. And in a departure from previous 
practice, McDonald's is making a concentrated effort, opening outlets in eight 
countries in about 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers might question the wisdom of bringing a high-profile American 
icon such as the golden arches into an area where the United States is 
sometimes called the "Great Satan." 
</P>
<P>
 However, industry analysts say people in the Middle East distinguish between 
American culture and its political dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might not want anything to do with America or Bill Clinton," Hickok 
said. "But don't confuse that with a burger, fries and a Coke." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say McDonald's doesn't have to modify its methods. Skinner said 
the restaurants in Saudia Arabia close four times a day for 30 to 40 minutes to 
accommodate Muslim prayer traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jeddah restaurant is about 7,000 square feet -- considerably larger than 
typical U.S. stores that range from 2,000 to 3,500 square feet, Skinner said.

THE TRIALS OF LAWYER-MOMS; FAMILY: JUGGLING TWO DEMANDING CAREERS HAS PROMPTED 
WOMEN TO FORM A GROUP THAT EASES THE MOVE FROM LEGAL EAGLE TO MOTHER HEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A room at the foot of the stairs is where Kate Gould, mother of two, practices 
her other profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking out at a suburban view of trees, a swing set and her son's elementary 
school, she settles down to draft wills and plan estates until the kids come 
home in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Shari Danch doesn't even have a room of her own. The computer, fax and copying 
machine share the living room of her Capitol Hill row house. Her clients, 
mostly people with labor-related grievances, tell her all about them at her 
dining room table. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-proclaimed "mommy-track lawyers," Gould and Danch are members of the 
Lawyers at Home Forum, a burgeoning group that tries to reconcile two of the 
world's most demanding professions. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed just more than three years ago when dozens of women responded to an 
anguished letter in the local Women's Bar Assn. newsletter, the group doubled 
in its first year and has doubled again to 160 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just blossomed," said Carlie Sorenson Dixon, at whose Georgetown home the 
first meeting was held. "You know lawyers -- we are very organized. This group 
is the fastest growing committee in the Women's Bar Assn." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently unique in the country, the forum has several members from outside 
the Washington area and has received queries about forming similar 
organizations from as far away as Texas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Its members have resumes that vary from high-powered partner to first-year 
associate. They run the gamut from new mothers who have chosen to give up 
practice temporarily to women working 40 or 50 hours a week -- considered part 
time in a profession in which 80-hour workweeks are not exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
 The common denominator, the group's "statement of purpose" declares, is that 
members be "attorneys who have turned a significant portion of their energy 
from careers to families" and who intend to return to the paid work force if 
they have stopped for now. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for annual dues of only $8, the forum provides emotional support and 
practical advice on setting up a home office, doing pro bono (volunteer) work 
or retraining for other careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a lifesaver," Danch said. "I've gotten information on whether you 
need a license to practice from home (you do in Washington), taxes and how to 
get part-time malpractice insurance. It's kept me from doing a lot of stupid 
things and really saved me time. We also have an internal referral system so if 
one of us gets a call not in our particular area, we can refer to others in the 
group. If we just have a question, we can call and get an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond assistance on such material matters as what kind of software you need 
for accounting, the forum helps deal with the trauma professional women often 
feel when they decide to step off the fast track for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a complete shock in every way," said Kathryn Mann Horlick, who quit a 
high-pressure job at the Treasury Department when her first son was born in 
1989. "The skills you need for parenting were not the ones I had been 
developing for a decade." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it harder for lawyers than (for) people in other professions? I don't 
know, but it's hard," said Julie Heflin, who got her law degree at USC and 
whose first job was as a corporate litigator at the Los Angeles firm Morrison 
and Foerster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us are Type A personalities who are used to having pretty structured 
lives. You know when you have a brief due, when you have to make a court 
appearance or have a meeting with a client. Then all of a sudden, nothing is 
structured and your days are not your own." 
</P>
<P>
 Following her husband back east, Heflin had a rude shock in 1990 when she told 
a prospective boss at the U.S. attorney's office in Washington that she was 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I wasn't obligated to tell him, I did and said 'I hope it's not a 
problem,' " Heflin recalled. "He said, 'Yeah, it kind of is.' He told me I 
might be able to get a month off without pay and even that was not definite." 
</P>
<P>
 That experience helped persuade her to take a part-time job after her first 
child was born. When a second son followed two years later, she decided to stop 
for a while, even though it cut hard into the family finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum, which she joined in 1991, eased the stigma of going from legal 
eagle to mommy hen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group has been such a tremendous support in terms of making the decision 
to stay home full time," Heflin said. "When I joined, I thought, 'Wow, there 
are other people -- lawyers -- out there doing the same thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Horlick, one of the group's founding members, the forum has helped keep up 
her organizational skills and broaden a background previously focused on 
reviewing applications for exceptions to economic embargoes against such pariah 
nations as Libya and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Since quitting that job, her work has been less arcane: She has tutored 
elementary school students and prepared a survey for local authorities on drug 
treatment centers hospitable to pregnant women and women with children. 
</P>
<P>
 The manner in which the survey was done -- two other forum members helped -- 
reflects the loose structure of the group, which has no president, just a 
steering committee that is supposed to have five members but currently has six. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a female model," Horlick said. "We do not have to have any one person in 
charge, but everything gets done. If someone's about to drop the ball, she 
calls somebody else who picks it up." 
</P>
<P>
 At least half the members are working professionally in some capacity; about 
30 have practices in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A motto for the group, Horlick suggested, could be: "Putting family first but 
not forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties of lawyering and mothering simultaneously can be daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould, the attorney with the view of her son's elementary school, said she 
tries to fit her work around her children's schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it doesn't fit -- that's the challenge. For example, I have a court date 
coming up and I have to figure out a backup plan if my son, who had strep and 
every other thing you can name last year, wakes up sick that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Muir, who has boys ages 8, 6 and 5 (the first two planned and the third 
sent "to keep me humble") has had to hide in her office closet with a cordless 
phone to blot out the background din. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Lawrence, an immigration lawyer, recalled putting a lock on the door of 
her home office, as well as employing a baby-sitter. "But my son would still 
lie on the floor next to the door and shout" while she tried to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Cohan, who works 40 to 50 hours a week arranging Asian joint ventures 
for American companies, uses a conference room downtown "as a sort of corporate 
facade" for meeting clients, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But other home-based lawyers said their informal image was actually an 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting around her dining room table "doesn't seem to bother" her clients, who 
come from middle- and low-income groups, Danch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a whole network of people who don't feel comfortable going into a 
big lobby," agreed Muir, who does contracts for small businesses and writes on 
environmental policy when she's not caring for her three sons. "There is a 
market out there of people who like the 'Oh, come to Mommy, Mommy will solve 
your problems,' approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Other advantages of home-based work are obvious. Joanne Pratt, head of a 
Dallas management consultant firm that did a survey for the Small Business 
Assn. last year, found that home-based workers "expressed greater job 
satisfaction" than those working outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pratt had no absolute figures, she said 6% of a nationwide sample of 
women workers age 34 to 44 had home offices, a figure that is growing by "a few 
percent a year at least." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 survey by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 5.6 million 
self-employed people work at home, 2.1 million of them women. 
</P>
<P>
 "With present-day technology, the fact that you're working at home is totally 
transparent," Pratt said. "It's definitely a growing trend, and the earthquake 
in California and the freezes in the Northeast and Midwest may speed it along." 
</P>
<P>
 Staying home suits USC graduate Heflin, who works on the forum steering 
committee and looks forward to a "gradual re-entry" into paid work once 
Spencer, 3, and Jorman, 11 months, are both in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying someone else couldn't do the same job with the kids, but I 
think I love them more and I wouldn't want to miss out on anything," she said, 
chatting in the kitchen while the baby napped and Spencer sang "I've Been 
Working on the Railroad" in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most challenging, aggravating, rewarding experience I've ever had, 
and no other job I ever have will hold a candle to it."

WINNING FOR LOSING; KATHLEEN SULLIVAN IS JUST GLAD TO BE BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT, 
EVEN IF THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS WATCHING HER WEIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Kathleen Sullivan has a lot on her plate these days. 
</P>
<P>
 There are all those lean turkey breasts and lightly dressed salads, and then 
there's that big fat deal with Weight Watchers that has her on the most public 
diet in the history of the world.  
</P>
<P>
 And if that weren't enough to drive a person to the nearest 31 Flavors, 
there's this fuss over the seemliness of a news anchor -- even one unemployed 
for nearly four years -- doing commercials for anything , including healthy 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it bother me? Oh, yes. Does it hurt sometimes? Absolutely," Sullivan 
says. "But I learned a long time ago not to expect to be treated fairly. I 
expect to survive. And I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at the counter of her tiny kitchen in her tiny Rancho Mirage 
condominium, the increasingly tiny Sullivan is chopping raw vegetables with a 
very sharp knife and talking about what else she has survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the entire 12 months of 1990. That's the year her father died, her 
husband left her, she was fired from "CBS This Morning" and left in "financial 
ruin."  
</P>
<P>
 Chop-chop-chop.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us think when there is suffering and challenge this (chop) is 
difficult, this (chop) is hard. But that's the point: Life is hard!" 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is less hard if you are a Size 6, which -- surprise! -- Sullivan 
says she is now. "I'm 3 1/2 pounds from my goal weight," she recently 
confessed, "but I'm going to readjust it and then take seven more pounds off 
that. It's not like you're on a shake for two weeks. This is a whole new way of 
eating, a new way of living." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Every week or so, a team of Weight Watchers inspectors comes to the 
pitchwoman's home and puts her on a scale just to make sure she's actually 
getting smaller -- which she is -- and make her sign affidavits vowing that 
Superstart! and the company's other reducing plans are the reasons why -- which 
she swears they are. (What she will not say is how much she weighs or how much 
she's getting paid.) 
</P>
<P>
 Every three months, Weight Watchers has the option of canceling Sullivan's 
contract. "We'll see if I make my weight and they still want me. . . . 
(chop-chop-chop ) That's OK. No pressure (CHOP! )."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Pasadena's Huntington Hospital 40 years ago, Kathleen Mary Sullivan 
grew up eating healthy food. Raised in Arcadia, she was an only child who loved 
to climb trees (a hobby she gave up two years ago), play tennis with her pal 
Cathie Lee Crosby and watch television news with her beloved grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day my grandmother, whom I spent a lot of time with, pointed to a woman 
reading news on TV and said, 'Kathleen, you could do that.' It's very 
empowering for someone to tell you you can do something. So, I quit USC my 
junior year and I went out and I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, someone told her that she could anchor the Winter Olympics in 
Sarajevo, even though no woman had ever anchored such an important sporting 
event. But she went out and did that, too. Her baritone delivery and colorful 
Slavic wardrobe assembled from Sarajevo shops transformed Sullivan overnight 
into the first "sweater girl" of sportscasting. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, she switched to CBS, where, in an early morning market of perky 
blondes, she was, according to the New York Times, like a shot of "double 
espresso." And like the drink, the sweet-faced Sullivan was potent; she woke 
you up. A Mary Tyler Moore with attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, critics raved about Sullivan for being smart, occasionally tart, 
always stylish and refreshingly natural. Back then, you may recall, Kathleen 
Sullivan had something no other woman on television had: gray hair. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was fired, some critics said it was because she had grown bossy and 
temperamental. Others confided off-the-record that she'd simply grown too gray. 
 
</P>
<P>
 When she showed up on television last month -- almost four years after her 
Valentine's Day dismissal from CBS -- it was with a bit less attitude and a lot 
less gray. 
</P>
<P>
 Without apology or explanation, she had dyed her hair raven black and taken a 
job she "really needed."  
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in a baggy dark sweater and patting her belly, Sullivan's candor 
once more caught America off-guard. "One moment I'm a network anchor and the 
next, well, look at me," she announces in the first of her Weight Watchers ads. 
She needs to get back in shape, she says. "Don't make me do this alone," she 
implores viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is amazing how this campaign has hit people," Sullivan says. "In the 
grocery store, three women -- that's the average, three women and a man -- come 
up to me and greet me so sincerely. . . ." Her eyes fill with tears as she 
spears a bite of salad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe this is only 14 calories?" Sullivan asks, pointing at the 
salad. "And that includes the dressing. Not too much dressing though. But 
please, please have some more." 
</P>
<P>
 She says she is not embarrassed by what she calls "the fall." Neither are most 
viewers, she says. If anything, her return as "a mere mortal" (albeit one with 
artificially colored tresses) has delighted many of her old fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that they've seen me (on the commercials), they think I'm less austere. 
My image is more approachable and that is the highest honor," Sullivan says. 
"Before, people didn't know what to say to me. Now they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'How's it going? Good luck.' That's a great thing about Weight 
Watchers. I'm not usually big on group things, but this is one area where you 
can really do a lot with support from others." 
</P>
<P>
 Her critics, most of them professional media observers, have complained that 
her commercials may confuse viewers. Some charge that her endorsement of a 
product is an abuse of her credibility as a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although others, including Linda Ellerbee and Mary Alice Williams, have taken 
similar turns in the world of commerce, Sullivan's turnabout was hardly sudden. 
For years, she seemed not to exist in the world of network broadcasting. She 
was, some say, a non-person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly thought they had forgotten about me. I'm stunned by the attention 
now," Sullivan says. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, she supported herself by conducting golf clinics designed to 
make courses "more comfortable environments for women." Her best friends 
include such strong, confident and athletic women as Martina Navratilova, Joan 
Lunden and her neighbor, Dinah Shore.  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors report that when she and Shore golf together at the Mission Hills 
Country Club and one of them sinks a putt, Shore often bursts into song -- 
usually, "Around the World in Eighty Days." 
</P>
<P>
 One day after a golf tournament (her seven-handicap made Sullivan captain of 
her otherwise all-male team), Sullivan looks robust but not overweight.  
</P>
<P>
 She pushes a forkful of spicy turkey stir-fry around her hand-painted Italian 
pottery dinner plate. "A little dry, isn't it? I always overcook with poultry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gosh, don't you hate it when your hostess immediately begins apologizing for 
the food she's put in front of you? Didn't your mother always do this? Mine 
did. Martha Stewart never would. Never." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she began Weight Watchers last November -- "Can you imagine going 
through all those holidays? I plateaued at first but I did it! I did it!" -- 
Sullivan's diet history included a brief flirtation with SlimFast. Today, she 
sees that was "a temporary fix." To lose weight and keep it off, she says, you 
need "more than a shake." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, wouldn't it have been easier to make a SlimFast-type commercial? You 
know, one of those before-and-after testimonials where you only show how fat 
you once were after you are slim and trim.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Weight Watchers executives say her "real-time" weight-loss shows are as 
risky as "the flying Wallendas without a net." But Sullivan is unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, yes, of course, I had some hesitation," says Sullivan, gazing across to 
the snow-capped mountains beyond her dining room window. "I mean, can you 
imagine failing at this?  
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't always do the things that are easy. And that's all right because 
I have a great life now, don't I?"

JACK SMITH: CRUISE FEEDS THE SOUL AND THE STOMACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife and I have just returned by Air France from a South Seas cruise in 
French Polynesia aboard the power and sailing ship Wind Song, a four-master 
that looks very pretty with its sails full of wind. 
</P>
<P>
 We went with a Music Center group. They were congenial and hardy, and a lot 
better company, I'm sure, than the men who sailed with Captain Cook 200 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The main rewards of a tropical cruise, I discovered, are not the weather or 
the scenery, but the food, the relaxation and the company. I spent most of my 
time dozing in our cabin, although I never missed breakfast, lunch or dinner. 
We never missed our daily fix -- a vodka tonic before dinner -- although I 
usually had two because they were not as strong as those my wife mixes at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Knocked out by the long overnight plane ride from Los Angeles International 
Airport to Tahiti, we didn't leave the ship the first day, but the second day 
being Sunday, we went ashore on Huahine for church. I am not a churchgoer, but 
the idea of a service in Polynesian appealed to me. 
</P>
<P>
 The church was within easy walking distance from the ship. "Go to the gas 
station and turn left," we were told. There it was. The Catholic Church. A low 
oblong stucco building with large open windows. 
</P>
<P>
 We could hear the singing from outside, mostly children's voices, loud, sweet 
and right on key. 
</P>
<P>
 The services were about to begin. The priest arrived. A Polynesian in a bright 
green robe with a stripe of gold medallions down the front. He wore a white 
pikake blossom over one ear. He said his blessings in the island Polynesian and 
then a young woman took over to direct the singing. The church was full of 
children in brightly colored cotton clothing. They sang like angels, in French 
and Polynesian, knowing the words by heart. 
</P>
<P>
 E te hatu, a hio na.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of them grew restless between songs; they were disciplined by a stout 
gray-haired woman in a white satin dress and pancake straw hat encircled with 
white flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 At communion, the children crowded forward, the sacerdotal wafers being the 
only food in sight, opening their mouths as the priest popped in the wafers. 
During one song we all held hands with our neighbors, and then the collection 
box was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 We sailed for Raiatea in the afternoon and went ashore the next morning to 
explore the tiny town, dodging motor scooters and bicycles. My wife bought a 
pareu -- the native skirt -- and, using her French, found a pharmacy where she 
bought me a package of cough drops for $8.75.  
</P>
<P>
 I went back to the ship to rest, but my wife climbed almost to the top of the 
island mountain, encountering cows, dogs, chickens and an occasional farmer. 
That evening, there was a get-together for honeymooners, but we were 54 years 
too late. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bora Bora, my wife circled the island in an open helicopter, a foolhardy 
adventure I eschewed. We went ashore to have dinner at the famous Bloody 
Mary's. The names of celebrities who had visited Bloody Mary's are carved on a 
large varnished board out in front, among them Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 The floor of Bloody Mary's is covered with white sand. Dinner was uneventful, 
except for a crab that crawled across the sand toward our table. We held our 
breaths until it scurried away. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning we toured Bora Bora on what is called "Le Truck." That is a 
flatbed truck fitted with hard seats. The roads are not good; the ride was 
rough, but the scenery was indescribably beautiful. Stark volcanic mountains; 
thick vegetation; pink, red, white and yellow flowers, and a translucent blue 
lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at that bird!" my wife exclaimed at one point. It was just a chicken. 
That is the spell of the islands. Everything seems exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 After we got under way that afternoon on the Wind Song, my wife watched the 
island scudding by through the porthole and said, "I think we're going the 
wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 I said: "You'd better tell the captain." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the end of it. The next morning, we anchored in Cook's Bay on Moorea, 
an island of striking ruggedness and beauty. We toured it on another truck, 
stopping for a lecture in the jungle. My wife got several insect bites, but I 
got none, which proves something, I suppose. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening was Polynesian night on board. My wife wore her new pareu, which 
she tied precariously around her torso with two borrowed safety pins and a 
crown of creamy white blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilization has left its mark on the islands. The Polynesians historically 
engaged in war and human sacrifice, but the white man brought firearms, alcohol 
and syphilis. The missionaries brought Christian morality, teaching women to 
cover their breasts. And none too soon.

 And now for today's truly cosmic questions: What makes popcorn pop? Where does 
the water go when you flush the toilet? Why do people die? How do they get the 
stripes in toothpaste? 
</P>
<P>
 To children, anyway, these are the pressing mysteries of the universe.Any 
parent who has tried to unravel such perplexities as "do worms have blood?" can 
attest to the ceaseless -- no, make that relentless -- curiosity of the younger 
members of the human race.  
</P>
<P>
 But while many of us, foolishly, were turning to our backgrounds in biology, 
theology and various other "ologies," it took a professor of bookology to, 
literally, write the book on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 A bookologist, lest you wonder, is a doctor who diagnoses reading questions 
and writes prescriptions for the appropriate books. As it happens, E.A. Hass -- 
a.k.a. Dr. Rita Book -- is the world's only bookologist.  
</P>
<P>
 "Big Questions Little Kids Ask" is Dr. Book's noble attempt to help save the 
sanity of parents of preschoolers. It is published by Avon and includes 
toddler-tested explanations about "stuff in the sky," nature, animals and other 
living things, how things work and that ever-fascinating topic, people's 
bodies. ELIZABETH MEHREN

MOTOROLA IS A VETERAN OF JAPAN BATTLES; TRADE: ELECTRONICS GIANT SCORED AN 
EARLIER VICTORY FOR ITS PAGERS. NOW IT SEEKS A FAIR DEAL FOR CELLULAR PHONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It started with pagers. Motorola invented them and by 1978 was the worldwide 
leader -- except in Japan, where the Nippon Telegraph & Telephone monopoly 
refused to buy from anybody outside a cozy circle of Japanese companies such as 
NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 So Motorola launched what turned into a protracted siege. It borrowed the 
battering ram of the U.S. government to weaken Japanese resolve, and after 
tortuous negotiations and the personal intervention of then-Secretary of State 
George P. Shultz, NTT agreed to let foreign suppliers bid on its business. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was just the beginning. New pagers had to be designed and built to 
NTT's arcane specifications and stringent quality standards. Undeterred, 
Motorola built a new American factory line and a special testing facility in 
Japan. Defect levels in its pagers fell nearly to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to take away any excuse for why American companies can't be 
successful in Japan," says Arnold Brenner, Motorola's executive vice president 
in charge of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola finally managed to capture a large part of the pager market in Japan. 
Yet despite 16 years of effort and a remarkable record of success practically 
everywhere else, the company continues to face barriers at every turn in 
Japan's cellular telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
 Such problems have led to a clash between the world's two biggest economies 
over a balance of payments more lopsided in Japan's favor than ever before. 
Should a trade war erupt between Washington and Tokyo, the spark in the powder 
keg may very well be Motorola, whose struggle culminated last week in President 
Clinton's announcement that he would level sanctions against Japan for reneging 
on promises to give Motorola full access to its cellular-telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
 But Motorola isn't just a catalyst. More than most companies, it has 
experienced the full range of the Japanese economic miracle. Thanks to Japanese 
competition, Motorola has transformed itself. The question now is whether, 
thanks to Motorola and its influence in Washington, Japan will do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Motorola, the transformation was mostly positive. Driven from the 
television manufacturing business, Motorola remade itself as a cutting-edge 
technology company and bounced back to challenge Japan Inc. in one of its 
greatest strongholds -- microelectronics. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japanese companies like NEC and Fujitsu continue to make inroads into 
the U.S. market in such key sectors as cellular phones, Motorola remains the 
industry leader. It also excels in computer chips. Last year its earnings 
doubled to $1 billion from the year before, while sales climbed 25% to $16.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Motorola has beaten a path into the Japanese market, it is a narrow 
path not many can follow. Few U.S. companies have the combination of 
technological leadership, financial muscle and diplomatic clout Motorola has. 
The company hires experts on Japan, including former U.S. trade officials, to 
advise it, and the official in the U.S. trade representative's office most 
knowledgeable about Japan is a former Motorola executive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of all this, Motorola remains hobbled in Japan. Yet Motorola also 
knows that it can't give up. Company executives say that unless American 
companies fight to build positions in the Japanese market, they will eventually 
face trouble at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola was one of the first American companies to recognize this. In 1978, 
Bob Galvin, then Motorola's chief executive, led the company's senior 
executives on a retreat to assess the company's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't look good. Japan's blitzkrieg attack on U.S. television markets 
in the late 1960s and early 1970s had so devastated the market that Motorola 
had been forced to sell its last defect-plagued television factory to rival 
Matsushita in 1974. Motorola's CB radio business was also demolished by 
Japanese competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola responded by moving up into such high-tech sectors as semiconductors, 
computers and telecommunications. But the Japanese government had targeted the 
same businesses, and Japan was already pushing American semiconductor firms out 
of the important computer-memory market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Motorola executives returned from the retreat with a clear goal: Stop 
Japan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be no more short-term thinking. Investments that would help win 
market share in Japan would no longer have to meet the return-on-investment 
criteria required for investments elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that if we allowed Japan to maintain the sanctuary (of its 
domestic market), they would be able to generate profits at home to put us out 
of business," says Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy paid off in spades. As a result of pursuing Japan's pager market, 
for example, Motorola learned that its quality wasn't what it thought.  
</P>
<P>
 "They thought their defect levels were world class," says David Yoffie, who 
wrote a case study on Motorola for Harvard Business School. "They discovered 
Japanese defect levels were lower than they ever thought necessary or even 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 To catch up, Motorola launched a corporate-wide quality improvement program. 
Today Motorola is the leader in Japan in pager sales. Its extensive presence in 
Japan helped win the customer trust needed to put Motorola microprocessors at 
the heart of such Japanese products as Sony Camcorders and Canon cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola also strived to shore up its defenses. In the early 1980s, it moved 
aggressively to file dumping charges against imports of Japanese pagers and 
cellular phones. The moves resulted in duties of up to 106% on products from 
Japanese companies such as Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola went to work on public opinion, too. In controversial ads, it boasted 
of its improved quality and complained about unfair Japanese trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "They recaptured the old 'What's good for General Motors is good for America' 
feeling," says Michael Borrus, a researcher at the Berkeley Roundtable on the 
International Economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The most grueling confrontation has been over Motorola's efforts to get a fair 
share of the market for cellular phones, an area where Japan has already made 
major inroads in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 The first barriers in the early 1980s were testing and certification standards 
that were designed to favor Japanese products already on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 1986, after years of pressure, Motorola's cellular standard, which 
conformed to systems used in the West, was approved. Coincidentally, the 
Japanese government chose to allow competition in the cellular market -- 
competition Japanese style. 
</P>
<P>
 When Motorola joined with a Japanese partner to offer alternate cellular 
services, it was only allowed to install its system in western Japan, which 
represents about 40% of the Japanese population. NTT's system would operate 
throughout Japan. And a new carrier called IDO, made up of such well-connected 
corporations as Toyota Motors and NEC, was given a license to operate in the 
rest of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were even less fair than they appeared. Since IDO adopted the NTT 
system (built by NEC), its cellular phones could now be used anywhere in the 
nation. Motorola's phones could not even be used in such key centers of 
business as Tokyo and Nagoya. 
</P>
<P>
 Again Motorola complained. Through the intervention of the U.S. government, 
the company won in 1987 the right to expand its territory. Still, the company 
could not offer its services in the Tokyo-Nagoya corridor. The Ministry of Post 
and Telecommunications (MPT) insisted there was not enough radio bandwidth for 
an additional system. 
</P>
<P>
 The following year, however, when the MPT quietly offered frequencies to a 
well-connected Japanese firm to offer cellular services on taxis, Motorola 
shouted foul. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Motorola filed an official complaint, taking advantage of the new 
1988 Omnibus Trade bill. That bill authorized the U.S. trade representative to 
retaliate against partners with persistent unfair trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Time was of the essence. Motorola has just introduced the MicroTac, a cellular 
phone smaller and a third lighter than any Japanese product available. It was a 
rare competitive advantage and Motorola wanted to move while it still held the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Motorola's complaint, the U.S. trade representative cited Japan 
in 1989 for limiting U.S. entry into Japanese markets. Duties of 100% could be 
applied on Japanese telecommunications equipment if negotiations failed to 
resolve the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan finally caved during last-minute negotiations in a Washington, D.C., 
hotel room between Japanese power broker Ichiro Ozawa and freshman U.S. trade 
representatives consulting repeatedly over the phone with Motorola executives 
on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 IDO reluctantly accepted the compromise. But then the company dragged its feet 
when it came to implementation. The Japanese Postal Ministry, which had forced 
the compromise on IDO, told complaining Motorola officials that it was now a 
strictly private issue and the ministry could do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 By last year, IDO still hadn't built enough transmitters to cover even half of 
the Tokyo region. Few customers wanted to buy phones that could only be used in 
parts of the city. Consequently, while the Motorola joint venture in western 
Japan had a 50% share of the market, in Tokyo, Motorola's share was a skimpy 
1%. After months more of frustrating negotiations the U.S. Trade representative 
just last week set a Feb. 15 deadline for IDO to offer an acceptable plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline passed. Coincidentally, it was the day after Clinton's failed 
summit meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa. Clinton used the 
opportunity to send Japan a message by threatening sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Motorola says it is losing both time and money. From April this 
year, Japan will allow cellular phone makers to sell their products directly 
through retail stores instead of from carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in April there will be a tremendous rush to purchase cellular 
phones," says Brenner. Since Motorola covers only a small portion of Tokyo, "We 
will lose much of that initial thrust. Once a subscriber chooses a system it is 
twice as expensive to get him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola is demanding that IDO make the necessary investments to cover the 
Tokyo area within a year instead of the three years it plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola's decision to put itself once again in the middle of a potential 
trade war was not an easy one. Last year, Motorola's sales in Japan totaled 
close to $1 billion. Many American companies would have chosen not to risk its 
relationships in Japan by becoming the center of a trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always the risk of a backlash," says Brenner. "This is not the 
Japanese way." 
</P>
<P>
 But the upside is also great. Brenner figures the company's sales in Japan 
would be 250% higher if Motorola's share of the Japanese market was as high as 
its share of other overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. companies "are willing to accept the scraps," says Brenner. "When 
the market is this big, the scraps are juicy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Motorola's brash, in-your-face trade policies have won it respect, if not 
universal admiration. "In Japan, cowards die many times over while the valiant 
get respect," says John Stern, head of the American Electronic Industry Assn.'s 
Asia office in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens in this latest confrontation, says Stern, Motorola has 
established itself as a company that can't be pushed around. Said Stern: 
"Motorola has become someone who has to be included when decisions are made."

HOW TRW CAME DOWN TO EARTH; CONGLOMERATE: SATELLITES AND CREDIT REPORTS ARE 
THIS LITTLE-UNDERSTOOD FIRM'S BEST-KNOWN PRODUCTS. BUT IT IS AUTO PARTS -- 
ESPECIALLY AIR BAGS -- THAT SUSTAIN IT. INDEED, SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE COMPANY 
SHOULD DUMP HIGH-TECH. 
</P>

<P>
 Once, TRW was a company that fattened its profit and burnished its reputation 
by helping land American astronauts on the moon. Today, its fortunes ride in 
large part on keeping American motorists from slamming into their dashboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Automotive parts -- especially air bag safety restraints -- are the products 
powering TRW today, though the Cleveland-based conglomerate still fields a 
motley mix of businesses. Its space and defense operation, based in Redondo 
Beach, remains a premier builder of satellites and other spacecraft. Its 
consumer credit-reporting division is headquartered in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, that diversity was considered one of TRW's greatest strengths; its 
fortunes were not tied to any single business or geographic region. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the wisdom of the mix is being questioned, as the auto industry 
shows new vigor and aerospace continues an unrelenting fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Long gone are the 1980s, when TRW's auto parts and space divisions carried 
nearly equal weight. TRW is now primarily an auto supply company; its white-hot 
sales of air bags, engine valves and other car equipment generate nearly 
two-thirds of its business. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some analysts suggest that now is the time to sell the space or credit 
divisions -- or, perhaps, spin them off. That would cut loose the anchor from 
TRW's fast-moving automotive group and enhance the prospects for the space and 
credit groups themselves, the analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet TRW has no such intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it has embarked on a patient, stay-the-course strategy at a time when 
many of its competitors -- particularly those in the slumping aerospace 
industry -- are trying to reinvent themselves through acquisitions, spinoffs 
and other corporate razzle-dazzle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no present plans for any sort of dismemberment," TRW Chairman Joseph 
T. Gorman said flatly in an interview from Cleveland, where the firm has its 
headquarters. "Our current intention is to continue to run the company as one 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Gorman said, TRW's diversity now has a new purpose. The space and 
credit groups will bolster TRW's automotive division, he said, by providing 
aerospace technology and computer management know-how that can be transferred 
to auto parts production. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is tremendous opportunity for synergy between and among our three 
businesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 56, Gorman is in his sixth year of what has been a down-and-up ride as 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 He assumed the job from the legendary Ruben F. Mettler, a Caltech-trained 
engineer for whom a street is named in Redondo Beach. Mettler retired in 1988 
after 11 years as TRW's chief executive, leaving behind a firm with a unique 
blend of technological sophistication and financial savvy.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, not long after Mettler's departure, TRW ran into deep financial trouble, 
leaving it up to Gorman -- a square-jawed Yale Law School graduate -- to 
engineer a strong rebound that began in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the sales growth of its air bag systems, TRW's auto parts group 
generated 57% of the company's $8 billion in revenue in 1993. The 
space-and-defense group kicked in 35%, and the credit group and other 
information services provided 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto parts division is expected to keep growing sharply in the years 
ahead, with air bags selling faster than cars themselves, because new autos are 
increasingly coming equipped with two of the inflatable restraints. TRW is the 
only major producer of complete air bag systems, including both the bag and the 
components that do the inflating. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts estimate that TRW's air bag sales approached $1 billion in 1993, up 
nearly 50% from the prior year. (The company does not break out sales by 
product line.) Sales could jump further, to $1.8 billion, over the next three 
years, said Mark B. Johnson, an analyst at Roulston Research Corp., a 
securities firm in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although second air bags for front-seat passengers won't be mandatory for cars 
until 1997 (and for light trucks the next year), more than 60% of 1994 model 
cars are already coming equipped with dual air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air bag phenomenon has grown faster than even the government expected, 
because safety has become a really hot issue with consumers," said Christopher 
Cedergren, senior vice president of the research firm AutoPacific Group in 
Santa Ana. "That has pushed many manufacturers to offer air bags really before 
they've been mandated, and that's helped TRW tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by air bag sales, TRW saw a profit of $220 million in 1993, up 14% from 
$194 million the year before (excluding onetime charges related to accounting 
changes), even though overall sales slipped 4% to $7.95 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors like the results. The company's stock price has doubled since 
hitting bottom in 1991. It closed at $72.50 a share Friday in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the comeback is hardly complete. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW's credit-reporting and aerospace operations are staring at uncertain 
futures with modest or no growth. And TRW is still earning less on 
stockholders' investment than are rival conglomerates following a similar 
strategy of trying to solve their problems largely from within. 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples: Rockwell International Corp. and AlliedSignal Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Like TRW, both companies have major aerospace and automotive lines. And, like 
TRW, both have used massive layoffs and other means of cost cutting to bolster 
profits in the face of slumping defense budgets, while exploiting the current 
strength of the auto market. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet whereas Rockwell and AlliedSignal last year earned returns on stockholder 
equity of 19.6% and 18.1%, respectively, TRW's return on equity was 14.3%. That 
lagged not only its competitors, but the rate of return TRW itself posted back 
in 1987. (The figures exclude accounting-related charges incurred by all the 
companies.) 
</P>
<P>
 TRW is "just sort of hanging in a respectable manner," said analyst Michael 
Lauer of Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lauer and other analysts praise Gorman for leading TRW to a solid 
rebound from 1991, when the company was in serious financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW lost $140 million that year on sales of $7.9 billion, as its auto parts 
group was pummeled by the recession and disrupted by an explosion at one of its 
air bag plants. The space group, like other defense contractors, was caught in 
the grip of Pentagon cuts. And TRW's credit-reporting business was not only a 
financial mess, but it had just settled regulators' lawsuits stemming from 
massive errors in consumers' reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all this, TRW's stock price drifted down to the mid-30s, and the 
company's institutional stockholders grumbled. "There was a lot of 
displeasure," said Wayne Nordberg, a partner in Lord Abbett & Co., a New York 
money manager and major TRW stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gorman restored order. And he put TRW back in the black, cutting nearly 
half its space-and-defense work force -- bringing that sector down to 17,000 
people today -- and shedding several small or poorly performing pieces of its 
information services unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a reasonably decent job of cleaning up their businesses," said 
Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Dyer, executive director of the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, 
said his group's ownership of 1.2 million TRW shares reflects its endorsement 
of Gorman's approach.  
</P>
<P>
 Gorman has also maintained TRW's market leadership in several automotive 
markets worldwide -- not just in air bags. The company is a major provider of 
steering and suspension gears, seat belts and engine valves.  
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for TRW's space and credit groups are another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The many layoffs have helped the space group remain profitable despite the 
downturn in defense and NASA spending, and its order backlog remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
 But the division's earnings and sales continue to shrink, despite TRW's work 
on such high-profile defense satellite systems as Milstar (the first satellite 
was launched earlier this month) and the Defense Support Program early-warning 
orbiters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the space group's operating profit and sales dropped for the third 
straight year, to $205 million (excluding accounting charges) and $2.8 billion, 
respectively. Kidder Peabody's Lauer predicts the space group will see its 
share of TRW's overall operating profit dwindle to about 20% by 1996, from more 
than 50% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The division's problems -- and even the suggestion that the division should be 
unloaded -- are particularly painful for TRW, because its roots are in space. 
</P>
<P>
 The company began in a Los Angeles barber shop in 1953. Two Caltech graduates, 
Simon Ramo and Dean Wooldridge, opened for business after leaving Howard 
Hughes' fledgling Hughes Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair hoped to speed the development of a missile system they had devised. 
And they were quickly rewarded in the mid-1950s, when Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. was 
tapped to oversee the nation's development of a ballistic missile system to 
counter the Soviet Union's nuclear threat. 
</P>
<P>
 After merging with auto parts maker Thompson Products Inc. in Cleveland, the 
new TRW began winning satellite and space vehicle contracts as the Space Age 
flourished in the 1960s. When man first landed on the moon in 1969, it was a 
TRW engine that gently lowered Apollo 11's lunar module onto the Sea of 
Tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW attracted some of the nation's brightest scientists and engineers, drawn 
by the challenges of the early space and missile programs and California's 
allure. 
</P>
<P>
 The company became a premier maker of spy and telecommunications satellites 
and other spacecraft -- it has built more than 180 to date -- including Pioneer 
10 and 11, which provided the first close-up looks of Jupiter and Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, TRW went on a diversification binge, getting into such areas as 
oil field drilling equipment, electronic components and its credit-reporting 
service. But by the mid-1980s, the firm began unloading many of those lines to 
focus on the three divisions it has today. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorman said he is confident the space group's shrinkage can be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our productivity has improved dramatically" in the aftermath of the layoffs, 
he said. "We've reduced the bureaucracy, we've reduced layers of management. I 
believe we can grow it from here." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, counters analyst Lauer. "I disagree with the management that revenue 
with space and defense will commence a recovery," he said. "It will decline." 
</P>
<P>
 But the space division could grow, Lauer asserted -- fit were uncoupled from 
the company, much as Litton Industries Inc. is about to separate its defense 
business from its commercial operations -- or if the division had its own 
separate stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter step was taken by General Motors Corp. a decade ago when it sold 
shares in its Hughes Aircraft and Electronic Data Systems units but kept 
control of the units. The move enabled Hughes and EDS to raise cash and map 
their own futures outside GM. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauer said TRW's space group could use the same method to acquire other firms, 
enter new ventures and pursue other steps that its parent company would 
probably skip because they would detract from its robust auto group, Lauer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it's all moot for Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have absolutely no intention -- let me make myself very clear -- no 
intention whatsoever to sell our space-and-defense business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the credit-reporting division, "we have no current plans to sell that 
business, either," Gorman said, even though analysts don't see the division 
contributing much more to TRW's overall results in the next few years than it 
currently does. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit group has gradually been rebuilding its sales and profit after 
slashing costs and eliminating the errors and mismanagement that prompted the 
lawsuits and regulatory clampdown in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't paid enough attention, frankly, to the nitty-gritty details of 
making certain that our quality was high enough," Gorman said. "On top of that, 
the (division's) cost structure had become bloated." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We have fixed (the division) in terms of quality and service." 
</P>
<P>
 Fixes, in fact, are becoming the TRW way. Although the company has frequently 
dumped troubled assets in the past, TRW now plans to keep what it has, 
rehabilitate those operations that are struggling and hope they prosper on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we could create much more long-term value for the patient shareholder 
by fixing the businesses," Gorman said. "I think we have done that. We're happy 
with our performance." Reasonable Returns from a High-Tech Smorgasbord After a 
dismal showing in 1991, TRW's profits are climbing again despite lower sales. 
But the company still has not achieved the same high yield on its stockholders' 
investment that it enjoyed seven years ago. SALES In billions of dollars 1987:

O.C. ENTERPRISE / CHRIS WOODYARD: REAL-WORLD VENTURE INTO IMAGINARY WORLDS; 
MIKE AND SUE EARNEST'S HUNTINGTON BEACH COMPANY, DREAMATION, BUILDS ANIMATRONIC 
FIGURES FOR CASINOS, THEME PARKS AND RESTAURANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Mike Earnest, playtime never ends. He spends much of his workday in an 
imaginary land of gnomes, dragons and underground caverns. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnest, 34, is president of Dreamation, a Huntington Beach company that 
builds animatronic figures and other artistic creations for theme parks, 
casinos and resort hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to create something from scratch. It is always something different," 
he said. "It comes from some art director's mind, and we get to produce that, 
from a small talking toucan to a giant condor. It never gets boring." 
</P>
<P>
 When Disneyland wanted the mysterious Genie to pop his head out of a cave 
during dinner theater shows that retell the story of Aladdin, it came to 
Dreamation. And Knott's Berry Farm commissioned the giant condor as a prop for 
one of its stage shows. 
</P>
<P>
 A walk through Dreamation's workshop is like touring the back lot of a movie 
studio. A large green dinosaur costume hangs in a corner. In another room, 
workers sculpt robotic macaws destined for installation over a bank of slot 
machines at the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas. Others paint fiberglass cones 
that will become part of a surreal cavern in the new MGM Grand Hotel theme park 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's biggest challenge, Earnest said, is meeting tight deadlines. The 
MGM Grand, for instance, wants its cavern to be finished in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing three extremely large sets and have four weeks to do it," 
Earnest said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he is not rushed to get jobs finished, Earnest said, he enjoys sitting in 
on the meetings in which designers conjure up ways to transform ideas into 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a creative flow, and we get to work with some fine designers," he 
said. "One day it's a novice, and the next day it might be someone with 20 or 
30 years of experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Operated by Earnest and his wife, Sue, Dreamation is having its best year yet. 
Earnest predicts that annual revenue could reach $1 million -- almost triple 
last year's $350,000 in sales. The company now has 10 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnest, a Huntington Beach native, said the business sprang from his interest 
in motion-picture special effects. He got his first job in the industry in 
1981, when he started designing costumes and shows at the Victorville-based 
research division of Pizza Time Theater, a chain of entertainment-oriented 
pizzerias that cater to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, he was working as a creator and builder at Alchemy II Inc., a 
Chatsworth-based maker of talking toys and robotic characters. Among his 
projects was work on the Teddy Ruxpin line of talking teddy bears that was one 
of the hit toys of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earnests started Dreamation six years ago in Northridge. Sue Earnest, who 
has a background in art direction, is vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple decided to move the company to Huntington Beach because they wanted 
to bring up their two children there. "I just came home, basically," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Selling to theme parks, both domestic and foreign, has been the company's main 
business, but there have been other clients as well. For instance, Dreamation 
has crafted talking Rocky and Bullwinkle characters for six units of the San 
Juan Capistrano-based Bullwinkle's restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest area of sales growth, though, has been Nevada, where Las Vegas is 
trying to promote itself as a family destination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I perceive Vegas as a city that is actually an amusement park," Earnest said. 
"It has no boundaries, and the opportunity is there for the next 20 or 30 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking contacts in Las Vegas or other casino cities, he said, he tried the 
shoe-leather approach to sell his ideas. "I was just knocking on doors," he 
said. "I would come up on Monday and stay through Friday and talk to anybody 
who'd listen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who listened was an executive for Harvey's Resort Hotel-Casino at 
Lake Tahoe, who would eventually order a new shooting gallery featuring fuzzy 
forest creatures and menacing space aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 Verne Welch, general manager for Harvey's, said of Earnest's creation: "His 
piece just fits right in. He is very creative. I've asked him to look at other 
things he can do for us."

 Centex Corp., the nation's largest home builder, said Feb. 11 that it will buy 
915 home lots in Foothill Ranch, a planned community in south Orange County. 
Analysts hailed the $45-million purchase from developer William Lyon Co. of 
Newport Beach as a sign that the area's real estate slump is over. In a phone 
interview from Centex's Dallas headquarters last week, Timothy R. Eller, 45, 
chief executive officer of the company's Centex Homes division, spoke with 
Times correspondent Debora Vrana about the strategy for Foothill Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did you decide that now is the time to enter the Orange County real estate 
market in a big way? 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, we went through a similar downturn and in our experience it's best 
to grow at the bottom of the cycle. It's almost impossible to call the timing 
of these cycles, but that's where we think we are now in California. While the 
reasons for the California and Texas downturns were different, the consequences 
were the same. 
</P>
<P>
 We are already in Orange County with our project in San Clemente. We were 
unable because of the market to do any further expansion, although we wanted 
to. So we were very patient and just waited for the best opportunities. We've 
been continuously looking at areas in Orange County. We plan to be there for 
quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Has the Southern California real estate market truly bottomed out? 
</P>
<P>
 If we haven't hit bottom, it's pretty close. I don't think we'll see 
significant declines in real estate values from this point on. We're certainly 
able now to buy land in Orange County that we couldn't four years ago because 
of inflated land values. 
</P>
<P>
 One indicator we watch closely is job creation. And while job growth in 
Southern California is still negative, the trend is that it is flattening, and 
I think we may see an upturn shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Do you see a lot of parallels between the Texas and Southern California 
markets? 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, land values took a plunge as a result of the oil boom and bust. In 
Southern California, it was aerospace. In Texas, we bought a lot of our 
properties from the Resolution Trust Corp., which got them from banks, and 
savings and loans. In California, it's similar but instead of buying properties 
from financial institutions, we're buying them from home builders. There were 
hundreds of builders in California five years ago; now there are a lot fewer. A 
few years ago we were ranked about the 20th-largest home builder in California. 
Now we're in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
 We feel very bullish about long-term prospects for California and we intend to 
promote a similar strategy to the one we used in Texas.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if things start to pick up, but then further job losses in the 
area continue to erode our economy and real estate values drop again? 
</P>
<P>
 That's certainly a possibility. But that would be a different trend than we've 
seen in other areas of the country. Typically, the downturns are deeper than 
what anyone anticipates and the upturn is slower than anyone expects. That's 
what we've seen in California. And the indication so far in California is that 
the cycle is the same as in the Midwest and Texas.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What types of homes are you planning for Foothill Ranch?  
</P>
<P>
 We would anticipate building a major condominium project and homes ranging in 
price from $160,000 to $250,000. They will be targeted to first-time and 
move-up buyers. Clearly, there seems to be a demand for this type of home -- we 
are having good success in San Clemente in higher price ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why Foothill Ranch? Why not pick a project where your homes won't be selling 
alongside another builder's? 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill is a well-developed community, also well-located and executed. Those 
reasons outweigh any negatives, and a little competition won't hurt us. We can 
segment our development so we won't be competing directly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Centex is buying the lots for about 60% of what William Lyon paid at the top 
of the market. Even including the lot improvement costs, you will be able to 
build, at the least, the same size houses that are already there but for less 
money. Won't people who already have homes there be upset? 
</P>
<P>
 That's a question I just can't answer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several developers outside of our area -- Centex, Del Webb Corp. of Phoenix 
and the Rockefellers -- recently announced plans to build homes in Southern 
California. What does that mean? Are you all vulture investors? 
</P>
<P>
 I guess these moves signal that California is coming in vogue. On the vulture 
question, I can only speak for Centex and say we are not. If you look at our 
history, the markets we've entered are ones where we intend to be for the long 
term. We generally don't leave markets we've entered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How would you describe Centex?  
</P>
<P>
 You could characterize us as a market home builder, meaning we build houses 
that are in demand in the market we're building in. We build all types, 
(priced) from the $60,000s to $500,000s. We focus on market opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably our heaviest concentration is in Texas; over 30% of our volume is 
there. We're in almost every market in the United States except the Northeast. 
We're a large builder in Florida, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Colorado and the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Do you have any advice for other developers outside California who might be 
eyeing residential real estate here? 
</P>
<P>
 From a selfish standpoint, no. Although we are a public company, we don't have 
unlimited capital, and this transaction was one we considered very carefully. 
California requires a lot of capital because of the costs involved with all the 
regulations there. On experience in California. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in Northern California since the 1970s. We expanded into Southern 
California in 1987. We hit the market right before the peak, and it was tough 
to grow a business in Southern California at that time." On whether property 
values could be hurt by the recent fires and earthquakes. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly haven't seen any concern in the neighborhoods we're building. 
California has its earthquakes, Texas has its tornadoes, and Chicago has its 
snows. I think every area of the country has something to worry about." On the 
outlook for California. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "California was the last to boom and the last to bust. Right now, we don't see 
any areas of the country showing distress close to California's. Every other 
market seems to be relatively healthy now." On other projects. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking in Ventura County."

 Analyst review: "Gateway Communications ran into some major problems last 
year, in fact it announced in November that it had retained an investment 
banker to considering several options, including finding a buyer for the 
company. Evidently there have been some negotiations but no further 
announcements have been made. Gateway's stock isn't trading heavily, but the 
price is extremely steady. The trading history back to July of last year shows 
it at a low of three-fourths to a high of just over two dollars a share. It 
remains afloat, despite a third quarter loss. It will be interesting to see 
what develops for it over the next few months, especially with its LAN Expander 
products."

 Corporate outlook: "The results for the third quarter of 1993 reflect 
unrelenting price competition and margin pressure in the LAN adaptor market. 
Although we have recently made substantial staff and expense reductions, 
Gateway will continue to invest very selectively in research and development, 
including our LAN Expander products." -- Dr. Patrick F. Cadigan, chairman/CEO

INSIDE JOB: OCCUPATION: PEDIATRICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Name: Dr. M. Dev 
</P>
<P>
 Practice: Independent practitioner on staff at Martin Luther Hospital, 
Children's Hospital of Orange County and St. Jude Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Job description: Pediatricians are medical doctors who specialize in caring 
for infants and children. There are numerous sub-specialties in the field, 
including caring for premature infants and for children with cancer, heart 
conditions and other maladies. 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up: "I am one of the few pediatricians in the area who accepts Medi-Cal 
patients in addition to those who pay cash or are covered by other forms of 
health insurance. By doing this I know that I am filling a need. I am very 
happy in my work and sleep with a clear conscience because I use my skills to 
help children who would otherwise be neglected." 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs down: "This kind of practice takes a lot out of you sometimes. It is 
very frustrating and sad to see pregnant teens and very poor people with no 
health insurance trying to cope with sick children. But a person who is down 
will not be down forever if we can offer them a bit of help. The more we 
neglect them, the less hope they will have. I have seen people in very 
difficult circumstances turn their lives around, and I am always trying to 
think of ways to help them raise healthy children." 
</P>
<P>
 Next step: "I am trying to extend my office hours into the evening to make it 
more convenient for working parents to bring their children in for care." 
</P>
<P>
 Advice: "It is increasingly difficult to be an independent practitioner, 
especially with all the changes in the health-care system. I would advise 
someone considering becoming a pediatrician to go where doctors are needed most 
and to do whatever they can to make their practice very personal and caring." 
</P>
<P>
 Salary range: In Orange County pediatricians earn between $80,000 to $200,000 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: "I am always on call and work nearly every weekend. When I need to take 
time off, another pediatrician fills in for me, and I do the same for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Educational and training requirements: After finishing medical school, a 
pediatrician is required to complete three years of pediatrics study, followed 
by a three-year fellowship in neonatology, neurology or another pediatric 
sub-specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 Major employers: Health maintenance organizations and independent medical 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information: Contact the Orange County Chapter of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics at (714) 978-2415.

ANN CONWAY: WOMEN CAN FLY SOLO AT PARTIES AND STILL SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ballroom is buzzing with the chitchat of about 100 couples at Le Meridien 
Hotel in Newport Beach, where the Lincoln Club of Orange County is holding a 
dinner benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 And everywhere she looks, Paula Lingelbach of Laguna Beach sees the cheerful 
camaraderie she has come for -- but not one familiar face. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a problem. As a woman who regularly hits the nighttime social scene solo, 
Lingelbach counts on spotting an acquaintance who will help her make it through 
that awkward moment when she first sails into a crowded room. 
</P>
<P>
 She orders a glass of wine, takes a place at the edge of things and waits. In 
a few minutes, an acquaintance surfaces, and Lingelbach disappears with her 
into the throng. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a super time," she said the following day. " That's why I go out." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lingelbach and other women like her, staying home because your husband or 
boyfriend dislikes the social scene -- or because you don't have a date -- is 
tantamount to wasting a life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a people person," Lingelbach said earnestly. "I need people very much in 
my life. My husband doesn't. He's very self-sufficient, does his own thing." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, years ago, when her social peers didn't think she had a 
husband, she said. "I went out alone even then. When they learned I was 
married, they told me I'd better bring him to the next party they had. So I 
brought Bud, and he had a terrible time." 
</P>
<P>
 Waltzing into a social event, sans escort, brings her a special brand of 
freedom, Lingelbach said. "I don't have to worry about my husband being 
unhappy. If the event doesn't work out, I'm fine with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Vice President Jo Qualls, who is single, agrees. "Going out alone 
gives you the freedom to say hello to a lot of people," she said. "When you are 
with a date, you are more confined and worried about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, there was an expectation that you absolutely be escorted to 
a black-tie affair. Now, I see a lot of women coming alone. Women are more 
committed than ever to the community. And that means going out a lot to support 
it. At best, it's difficult to plan constant companionship for every event." 
</P>
<P>
 For Neiman Marcus executive Billur Wallerich, who is married, participating in 
a nighttime social event without her husband is less nerve-racking. "He doesn't 
enjoy these things. If he is there with me, I feel I must be watchful -- cater 
to him. If I'm alone, he's home and I take more out of the event. It's a 
win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Does her husband mind? "If he did, I wouldn't go," she said. "He thinks it's 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Performing arts philanthropist Zee Allred is another single woman who paints 
the town red by herself. "I only go where I know I will be comfortable, 
though," she said, "where I know I will be with friends." 
</P>
<P>
 For women who long to step out alone but are afraid to do so, Allred has this 
advice: "The more you do it, the easier it is. It's great fun. Somehow, you 
must make the effort." 
</P>
<P>
 When Nordstrom couture coordinator Anita Tabib attended a dinner party at the 
Bowers Museum of Cultural Art last week, it marked the first time she attended 
a gala by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person I was supposed to be with couldn't make it," she said. She said 
she thought about staying home. In fact, the idea of showing up solo terrified 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 But she decided to go for it. "I thought this was something I could attend 
alone because my hostess was a friend," she said. "The hardest part was that 
first minute, not knowing what I was going to face. The rest was easy. I had a 
wonderful time." 
</P>
<P>
 Would she do it again? "Maybe; it would depend on the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach socialite Jolene Engel said she doubts she'd ever attend a gala 
evening by herself. "I can't imagine my husband letting me out the front door 
without him," she said. "He's the one who signs up for all of the events. He 
wants to be there as much as I do." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she has the utmost respect for women whose husbands aren't as 
enthusiastic about the social swim. "I think it's wonderful that they're out 
there -- more power to them," she said. "I wish I had the courage to do it. 
Very strong women seem to be able to pull it off. Me, I'm shy." 
</P>
<P>
 After her divorce in the early '80s, Lois Driggs Cannon of Laguna Beach made 
the decision to party alone. "I had so much fun; I was usually the first one to 
arrive and the last to go home," said the woman who is now Mrs. Buzz Aldrin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided that the fact I was alone should not make any difference -- that 
the stress of being home alone was greater than going out alone," she said. 
"Even now, when Buzz is out of town, I don't hesitate to go out by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 People generally are very receptive of women alone, she said she has found. "I 
say to women, 'Don't stay home.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You never know when you're going to meet someone who is interesting, who 
can add to your life.' "

COUNTRY MUSIC MAVERICKS ARE TRUE TO THEIR NAME; SPOTLIGHT: WHILE THEIR ROOTS 
ARE IN THEIR CUBAN HOMELAND, THEIR PLAYLIST RUNS FROM POP TO ROCK TO OLD 
'HONKY-TONK NOBODY CARES ABOUT ANY MORE.' THE BAND WILL BE IN LAKE FOREST 
TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 4:30 p.m. and the Mavericks are in the middle of a sound check at In 
Cahoots country nightclub.  
</P>
<P>
 Sound check is the time when a band's main order of business is to be sure the 
stage monitors are on, that the bass drum doesn't overpower the guitars in the 
house sound system, and that all the microphones are plugged in. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, it's a good four hours before curtain time: four hours before 
the members of the Florida-based band need to be concerned with winning over a 
public that so far has had little exposure to their music; four hours before 
they need to impress the club's owners or any of the record company execs 
scheduled to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 So there's not a lot of serious music-making going on -- songs are started and 
stopped 30 seconds later, the drummer hits his snare incessantly while the 
sound mixer brings it up to the desired volume. That makes sound check a great 
time to glimpse a band's real personality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks don't just run through their set list for the evening. Instead, 
it's a sort of musical stream-of-consciousness: players' favorite tunes, songs 
they hope to add one day, songs they may have dropped long ago, or maybe a 
left-field choice to humor the other band members or to test their knowledge of 
musical trivia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks' sound check is particularly revealing. As if to live up to its 
name, the group reels off a lick from Buddy Holly's proto-rock ballad "Words of 
Love," a snippet of Cuban bandleader Perez Prado's 1955 instrumental hit 
"Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White," a casual yet chilling run-through of 
Patsy Cline's signature song "I Fall to Pieces," and a few bars of Fred Neil's 
"Midnight Cowboy" theme "Everybody's Talkin'." Finally, they zip off a troika 
of operatic pop masterpieces by lead singer Raul Malo from the Roy Orbison 
songbook, reminiscent of Orbison's effortlessly powerful vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hate barriers -- all these categorizations that the industry puts on 
music," Malo, 28, explained during an interview later. "Go back and listen to 
Bob Wills -- take out the steel guitar and the fiddle and put a clarinet in 
there and you've got Benny Goodman. So what's the difference?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks have been operating outside the mold from Day 1, when they 
formed not in Nashville, Austin, Bakersfield or any of the other standard 
country-music breeding grounds, but in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Malo's parents settled there in 1959 after emigrating from Cuba to escape 
Fidel Castro's new Caribbean order. The path the Malos and a generation of 
Cuban emigres took to the United States is chronicled in the title song from 
the Mavericks' critically praised 1992 major-label debut album, "From Hell to 
Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 That album was released by MCA Records' Nashville division, but it included a 
handful of songs that fell outside the country-music mainstream. Among them 
were the title song; "Mr. Jones," a skillful look at those who yearn for the 
bygone "good-old days," and "Children," a powerful lament about the toll of 
child neglect and abuse. It also contained several straight country songs, from 
covers of Hank Williams' and Buck Owens' hits to such Malo originals as "This 
Broken Heart," a Patsy Cline-drenched torch song. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when the Mavericks were getting categorized as the country-rock band 
without a category, Malo and his cohorts -- bassist Robert Reynolds, drummer 
Paul Deakin, guitarist Nick Kane (who are augmented on tour by keyboardist 
Jerry Dale McFadden) -- turned away from that label as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's hilarious is that from the beginning we've been pegged as this 
alternative, fringe band," said Malo, whose stocky build, swept collar-length 
hair and single earring defy country-music convention as much as the band's 
music does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're so un- alternative that we became the alternative. . . . We may 
play some pop songs, but most of the stuff we do -- not only that we write, but 
that we cover -- is just old country honky-tonk songs that nobody cares about 
any more. Maybe Dwight (Yoakam) does it -- he's really been the inspiration for 
it -- and Rodney (Crowell) does it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 While the album picked up lots of enthusiastic reviews, it generated little 
interest from country radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing to say about radio's response to the first album, because 
there was none," Malo said dryly. 
</P>
<P>
 His comment was more statement of fact than indictment.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the first record was not commercially viable with what was on the 
radio at the time, and we knew it, and that was all right," Malo said. "We 
wanted to make that kind of record. It was us at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his writing has changed somewhat since he moved to Nashville and began 
collaborating with other country songwriters.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really learning how to trim a song down, how to cut it down to the point, 
which is really what I always wanted to do. But when you're alone in Miami, you 
don't co-write with anyone down there because nobody knows how to write country 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 A great example is "There Goes My Heart," the opening track on the group's new 
"What a Crying Shame" album: 
</P>
<P>
 There goes my heart  
</P>
<P>
 Breaking in two  
</P>
<P>
 There go my eyes  
</P>
<P>
 Crying over you  
</P>
<P>
 My arms don't want  
</P>
<P>
 For us to part  
</P>
<P>
 Here come the blues  
</P>
<P>
 There goes my heart  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the album is devoted entirely to the kind of love-lost and 
love-thrown-away songs upon which country music built its name. To a degree, 
such songs have fallen out of favor with the country-music establishment of 
late, in their desire to send out increasingly positive messages, however 
superficial those messages may be. (To wit: The current slogan of Orange County 
country radio station KIK-FM, repeated endlessly throughout each day, is 
"Country music that makes you feel good .") 
</P>
<P>
 But that hasn't dimmed the Mavericks' love for songs from real life, such as 
"There Goes My Heart" and others that sound straight out of country-music past; 
songs in which relationships detonate in a mushroom cloud, leaving the 
participants as little more than smoking heaps trying to put the pieces back 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's the change in tone or honing of songwriting skills, the new album 
has given the Mavericks their first taste of commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
 The title song is currently moving up, albeit slowly, Billboard's country 
singles chart. Now that they are something of a known quantity in the music 
industry, the group members expect to make a deeper dent with the next single. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lemme tell you," Reynolds said with a pregnant pause, "there's something 
about having even a modest radio hit gives you the sort of validation you may 
not have bought into before you got it. You might have said before, 'It's OK -- 
we can be a critically acclaimed band and tour.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But you get that one little taste of acceptance and you realize (radio can) 
bring people to your shows. They can do a lot for your career," Reynolds 
continued. "You're born the day that (first record) goes into the Top 40 -- 
that's the day your life begins." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean the group has suddenly gone starry-eyed with visions of 
million-seller after million-seller. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality of a No. 1 record," Malo said, "is that they're just (ego 
gratification) for record companies and songwriters and an excuse for people to 
party. I'd much rather have all my records make it into the Top 20 than to have 
five hit No. 1 and then never be heard from again." 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, a hit record is not an end in itself for the Mavericks, but the 
means to the end of playing live. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't play live to be able to make records; we make records to be able to 
play live," Malo said. "It's the most fun thing we do." 
</P>
<P>
 The shift to the all-love-song slant of the new album, he said, had less to do 
with internal or external pressures to sell more records than with Malo's 
desire to improve his songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like writing songs like we did on this record," he said. "That 
doesn't mean we won't do social or political songs again. I would love to some 
day do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it comes naturally," Reynolds added quickly. "Interestingly, out of 30 
tunes Raul had written for the first record, four were social-political songs, 
and it just ended up that all four of those wound up on the record. . . . I 
think we got a lot of critical acclaim for tackling those kinds of subjects. . 
. . But Raul has always said that we don't want to be on a soapbox. And I think 
this album explores our roots maybe even more." 
</P>
<P>
 Those roots run deep in the soil of music that sprang from musicians who 
listened to their inner voices, not the music industry's omnipresent 
advice-givers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always going to be somebody telling you what to do or what not to 
do," Malo said. "That's why nobody is allowed backstage when we play -- so we 
don't have to hear about what songs to play or what not to play." 
</P>

SAWYER'S ABC DEAL: STAR VALUE; TELEVISION: SOME LAMENT THE 'HOLLYWOODIZATION' 
OF NEWS, BUT OTHERS SAY THE 'PRIMETIME' ANCHOR'S A SOLID JOURNALIST WITH 
RATINGS-POWER WORTH HER ESTIMATED $6-MILLION CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If the recent bidding war for Diane Sawyer resembled negotiations for the next 
Tom Hanks movie or the signing of a first-round draft pick, there is a reason. 
At a time when TV newsmagazines are increasingly competitive -- and 
increasingly important to their networks -- the handful of news stars who are 
perceived as having the "marquee value" to draw an audience can command 
superstar salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one more sign of the 'Hollywoodization' of news," said former 
NBC News President Reuven Frank. "It's the logical extension of the days when 
Barbara Walters was criticized for making $1 million a year when she moved to 
ABC News in the 1970s. If the network news divisions today are expected to make 
big money in prime time with newsmagazines, then why shouldn't Diane Sawyer 
make as much money as (basketball star) Shaquille O'Neal?" 
</P>
<P>
 Frank worries that "viewers are losing their differentiation between 
journalists and entertainment figures. But I don't blame Diane Sawyer for the 
trend." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's re-signing of Sawyer last week (at an estimated $6 million a year, 
double her previous salary) to be an anchor on three different prime-time 
newsmagazines also troubles some correspondents and producers, who worry about 
the role of yeoman news gatherers in "star vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 "If Diane Sawyer is making millions of dollars and contributing big pieces to 
several newsmagazines, where does that leave everybody else?" asks one network 
news producer. "It seems as if we're headed for a system where there are a 
handful of superstars, and everybody else is field troops." 
</P>
<P>
 But network executives note that Sawyer is a serious TV journalist as well as 
a news "star."  
</P>
<P>
 "In order to be a 'star' in news, you have to have intellect, journalistic 
ability, drive and something called presence," said ABC News Vice President 
Joanna Bistany. "Ted Koppel, Peter Jennings, Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer 
all have it. It's not just a matter of performance on the air -- you have to be 
a journalist who elicits confidence and credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Although ABC executives said Sawyer plans to continue some reporting in the 
field, it appears that her "marquee value" as an anchor was a major factor in 
her new deal -- as it was in the proposal made to her by NBC News President 
Andrew Lack. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC is said to have planned to make Sawyer the centerpiece of a new 
four-night-a-week newsmagazine series. NBC anchors Tom Brokaw, Katie Couric, 
Jane Pauley and others were to be involved, but the project is now on hold, 
according to NBC News executives.  
</P>
<P>
 The details of Sawyer's work for ABC are still to be worked out, but the plans 
are for her to be a major presence on at least three nights of prime-time 
newsmagazines, which eventually all may air at 10 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer will continue as co-anchor with Sam Donaldson on "PrimeTime Live," 
ABC's Thursday newsmagazine. In addition, she will team with "20/20" co-anchor 
Barbara Walters -- a frequent competitor with Sawyer for big-name interviews on 
their respective magazine shows -- to anchor "Turning Point," a Wednesday 
newsmagazine debuting March 9. (Jennings also will be an occasional anchor on 
"Turning Point.") And ABC sources expect Sawyer to be named co-anchor with 
Forrest Sawyer on the Monday newsmagazine "Day One."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she will continue as a regular substitute anchor for Jennings on 
ABC's "World News Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC executives said that Sawyer will not necessarily be anchoring all three 
shows every week, and they said that they intend to "cross-promote" other ABC 
journalists too -- with, for example, a timely Barbara Walters interview 
possibly airing on a newsmagazine that airs earlier in the week than Friday 
night's "20/20."  
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a saturation point reached sometime -- we don't know when 
-- among newsmagazines," said ABC's Bistany. "We are looking at all of our top 
talent to see how we can build the identity of ABC's newsmagazines so that we 
come out winners." 
</P>
<P>
 Another idea under discussion at ABC, sources said, is to have some kind of 
central "booking unit" to go after some newsmakers rather than having the 
various news programs competing against each other in addition to other news 
outlets. (How practical that idea is with the biggest names in the news 
business and what it would mean for the staffing and identities of various 
newsmagazines, however, remains to be seen.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some network observers wonder whether the competitive bids for 
Sawyer's services -- with CBS offering a "Nightline-style" newscast for 
syndication and Fox owner Rupert Murdoch reportedly offering $7 million to 
anchor a post-football news program like "60 Minutes" -- resulted in a feeding 
frenzy that led to ABC paying more than she was worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's certainly a major talent on-air, but there's no proof yet that viewers 
are going to want to watch her three nights a week," said one former news 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 But others point out that, as with the bidding for sports and entertainment 
stars, ABC came out ahead simply by preventing her from becoming a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Diane had gone to NBC, all you reporters would have written that (ABC News 
President) Roone Arledge had 'lost' her to NBC," said one ABC News source. 
"Perception is reality in this business -- and that was a factor in ABC's 
desire to have her stay." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if ABC didn't deploy her on the air, Diane Sawyer is 'reserve capital' 
for the network," said Everette Dennis, executive director of the Freedom Forum 
Media Studies Center at Columbia University. "The bidding for her services is 
simply a further recognition that news is a profit-making enterprise. ABC 
wouldn't have paid her this salary if they didn't think she would generate 
profits for the network."

TOM SNYDER IS DAVE'S LATE-NIGHT FAVORITE; TELEVISION: BUT LETTERMAN DOESN'T 
KNOW WHETHER CBS WILL OK THE CNBC HOST AS HIS LATE-LATE NIGHT FOLLOW-UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS late-night host David Letterman says he is interested in Tom Snyder as a 
candidate for a nightly series to follow his own show but doesn't know whether 
the network would go for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, 57, hosted a late-night NBC talk program, "Tomorrow," after Johnny 
Carson's "The Tonight Show" from 1973 to 1982. He has a contract to continue 
his 1-year-old CNBC cable talk show until January. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Costas recently turned down the post-Letterman series to remain with NBC. 
Regis Philbin has also been mentioned for the 12:35 a.m. job, but he has a 
contract with his syndicated series that runs through August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his feelings about Snyder hosting a companion show, Letterman, who 
would produce the series under his three-year, $42-million deal with CBS, told 
The Times: 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I would think of him, absolutely. But maybe it's just me. I'm 46. Maybe 
I'm the right audience for Tom. Maybe the network would say, 'Does Tom appeal 
to 16-year-old kids?' I don't know. I'm just telling you my personal taste. I 
think you could do a lot worse than Tom Snyder." 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman, who succeeded Snyder in the post-Carson show, said he is "very fond 
of the work of Tom Snyder and have been since I was back in Indianapolis, 
watching him from (the early 1970s) on. I watch his CNBC show. I keep saying to 
people, 'Is it just me who likes Tom or does everybody like Tom?' It was true 
with his (ABC) radio show. I would listen to that every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lassally, who with Robert Morton is co-executive producer of Letterman's 
nightly show, says they are all "big fans" of Snyder "and we would love to do a 
show with him. The name certainly has come up. But we haven't had any serious 
discussions with Tom or CBS. No negotiations are going on." 
</P>
<P>
 A CNBC spokesman noted that Snyder is "under contract" and said, "We plan on 
keeping him." A source at the cable network added, "We don't want to lose him. 
He does real good numbers for the network. I think we're going to do a lot to 
keep him." 
</P>
<P>
 CNBC is the cable network of NBC, with which Letterman had prolonged and 
public differences before he finally left last year to join CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Letterman camp and CBS would like to debut a follow-up series to his show 
by fall, once a host is found. But the comedian said "it would be a miracle" if 
his company can launch its late-late series that soon, adding: "Maybe, more 
accurately, the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS declined comment on the Snyder situation. Snyder also declined comment. 
But, last month in an interview, he said the Letterman show was "awesome. . . . 
He's taken 11:30 to a whole new level for CBS." 
</P>
<P>
 The post-Letterman show would give CBS a contender against NBC's new late-late 
night host, Conan O'Brien, who follows Jay Leno's "The Tonight Show." O'Brien 
inherited Letterman's old time period in the late-night game of musical chairs.

'LIPS TOGETHER, TEETH APART' WILL BE PRODUCED AT SCR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terrence McNally's elegiac comedy, "Lips Together, Teeth Apart," will fill the 
final slot of the South Coast Repertory's 1993-94 season on the Second Stage 
(April 26-May 29), the theater has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lips Together, Teeth Apart," a three-act work in a Chekovian mood, is about 
two mismatched couples whose troubles are revealed during a lazy Fourth of July 
weekend at an expensive beach house on Fire Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy had its world premiere in New York at the Manhattan Theatre Club in 
1991 and its West Coast premiere in San Diego in 1992 at the Hahn Cosmopolitan 
Theatre. The Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles also gave it a mainstage 
production last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 McNally is perhaps best known for his bittersweet drama, "Frankie and Johnny 
in the Claire de Lune," which SCR did on the Second Stage in 1989, and his 
brilliantly funny "The Lisbon Traviata." 
</P>
<P>
 Although SCR has yet to announce it, theater officials also say the opening 
show of the 1994-95 season in September will be the Tennessee Williams classic, 
"A Streetcar Named Desire," on the Mainstage. It is to star Kandis Chappell, a 
frequent SCR guest artist, as Blanche. The theater's co-founder, Martin Benson, 
will direct.JAN HERMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; INTELLIGENT LIFE EMANATES FROM SUPERNOVA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I think I've caught a space virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the only apparent symptom is the unwanted (though not entirely 
unpleasant) mental regurgitation of an impossibly dopey refrain set to a 
dangerously breezy little tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong, this is Supernova  
</P>
<P>
 No time to buy Coca-Cola.  
</P>
<P>
 The source of this virus is a punk rock trio called Supernova, which goes on 
stage in crash helmets and astronauts' flight suits, and claims to hail from a 
garbage dump in outer space. The malady is highly contagious, judging by the 
fact that Supernova's show Friday night at Our House was sold out four days in 
advance. True, the cozy bar and coffeehouse holds fewer than 200 people, but 
the Costa Mesa trio seems to be generating the biggest local buzz of any new, 
upcoming local band in quite some time. This goes to show that it never hurts 
to have a gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
 In Supernova's case, the gimmicks are ancient.  
</P>
<P>
 The late Sun Ra, the big-band leader who dressed like a wizard and led his 
jazz group, the Arkestra, through delightfully spacey shows, was claiming by 
the '60s to be a citizen of the outer planets. David Bowie rocketed to stardom 
in the early '70s by pretending to be a star man. George Clinton spent the same 
decade erecting an elaborate comic-satiric space mythology around his ensemble, 
Parliament-Funkadelic.  
</P>
<P>
 Devo, though not claiming origins in space, did spout sci-fi theories and wore 
uniforms like Supernova's. The gear gave Devo the freedom to bounce around 
nonstop in a way also mimicked by Supernova. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, Supernova recycles punk and new wave bric-a-brac even rustier than 
debris from Skylab, the space station that fell out of orbit in 1979 and 
crashed into Australia. The band plays a hybrid of trash-pop and punk rock that 
started with the Ramones and, in Supernova's case, descends most directly from 
the Dickies, the long-running San Fernando Valley band that exists only to be 
silly. 
</P>
<P>
 Art, the bassist, and Hank, the guitarist (Supernova keeps things on a 
first-name basis), were nasal yelpers who together sounded like a stereophonic 
version of the Dickies' singer, Leonard Phillips.  
</P>
<P>
 And they shared the Dickies' predilection for nonsense. Most of Supernova's 
deliberately dopey songs probably took less time to compose than they do to 
play -- and a bunch of those songs clock in at no more than a minute or two. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something to be said for dopiness. Nobody needs another angry rant 
set to a slow, heavy, grinding hard-core punk beat. Supernova found the soft 
underbelly of hard-core, and tickled it.  
</P>
<P>
 The lyric of their thrash-genre spoof went: "Chewbacca! What a wookie!" That 
chorus was chanted with gleeful enthusiasm and accompanied by Hank's 
approximations of the furry space-critter's roars and R2D2's robotic beeps and 
whistles.  
</P>
<P>
 Another song found Art happily chirping, over and over, "I'm a fool and I like 
to drool." Thank goodness the space virus didn't encode my brain with that one. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few things more insufferable than bands that try to do pop parody 
without having a deep fondness for and complete mastery of that which they mean 
to tweak. With its meaty, buzzing guitar riffs, punchy bass, and rapidly 
tumbling, hard-slamming punk drumming, Supernova has the late-'70s punk thing 
down better than many bands that take it seriously.  
</P>
<P>
 Supernova also hates slam dancing, and Hank heaped scorn on the handful in the 
house who tried to throw their weight around. This alone proves that Supernova 
is an intelligent life force, no matter how determinedly brainless its music 
may be. 
</P>
<P>
 On the current Nirvana song, "All Apologies," Kurt Cobain laments his 
inability to be "easily amused." That's one problem that anyone susceptible to 
Supernova clearly does not have. On the other hand, Supernova faces the risk 
assumed by all novelty acts: gimmicks that capture an audience the first and 
second time can leave it bored the next. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The opening act, Grandpa's Become a Fungus, also had a tongue-in-cheek 
quality, but took its influences from avant-rock sources rather than 
simple-minded ones.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo band's angular guitar scrapings owed debts to Captain 
Beefheart and Frank Zappa; its occasional overlay of garage-rock basics with 
white noise from a sampling keyboard hearkened back to Pere Ubu. Luke Warm, the 
keyboards player, intoned lyrics in a stilted sing-song that was uncomfortably 
close to Fred Schneider of the B-52's. 
</P>
<P>
 With the lyrics buried in the mix, it was hard to catch Fungus' meanings, but 
the general drift tended toward the weird and the ironic (what else would you 
expect from a band with a name like that?). It remained unclear whether the 
band has much to express beyond eccentricity, but the show did prove it can 
play.

LIFETIME'S 'OUR HOME' TO PREMIERE JUNE 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ABC has its "Home" show, and soon Lifetime will have "Our Home," a similarly 
styled program with tips on cooking, interior decorating and fashion. 
</P>

 Book review -- An article in Sunday's Book Review section incorrectly stated 
that the two authors of "Blood Brothers," a paperback on the killings of Jose 
and Kitty Menendez, covered the trial of the Menendez brothers for the Los 
Angeles Times.Author Ron Soble, a reporter for the Daily News of Los Angeles, 
has not been employed by The Times for a year and did not cover the trial for 
The Times. John Johnson, a reporter for The Times' Valley Edition, played no 
role in The Times' coverage of the trial. A statement on the back cover of the 
book contains similarly misleading information.
