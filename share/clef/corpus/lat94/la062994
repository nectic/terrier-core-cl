 Three views on the latest staff shake-up at the White House: 
</P>
<P>
 * Comedy writer Bob Mills says it was yet another demonstration of the 
Clintons' close Hollywood ties: "When the President decided to sack Mack 
McLarty, he asked Andrew Lloyd Webber to handle it for him." 
</P>
<P>
 * Comic Argus Hamilton says everyone in Washington knew about it when "they 
saw the White House helicopters all flying to the golf course in the 
traditional Missing Staff Member Formation." 
</P>
<P>
 * Comedy writer Tony Peyser says it was "the first Big Mac Attack the 
President ever had when he didn't order fries."

 Short Takes: Reader Mitch Jones of L.A., on the closing of "Sunset Blvd.": "I 
guess it proves the adage: Old actresses never die, they just Fayed away." 
</P>

 Comic Doug Babbit, on boxer Evander Holyfield's recent claim that his heart 
ailment was cured by faith healer Benny Hinn: "Great. Now let's see if this guy 
can do something about Don King's hair."

 Bob Hope, during an appearance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, about his

 Alan King, on telling his mother at a young age that he wanted to be a comic: 
"She replied, 'First, you'll be a doctor.' Said his pragmatic father: 'Let's

 Bernie was a businessman who didn't have as much money as he wanted. So he 
prayed, "Please God, you gotta help me. I've done wonderful things all my life, 
given money to charity, I've helped other people, I'd like to win the lottery." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, the next week Bernie wins $5 million in the lottery. He buys a 
$125,000 car and a beachfront condo, divorces his wife, gets a nose job, face 
lift, fantastic toupee and expensive new wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he's driving along the Hollywood Freeway with his young starlet 
girlfriend when suddenly he smashes into an abutment. He's thrown 30 feet from 
his car, his suit is ripped, his toupee falls off, his face is smashed and 
there are bruises all over his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie looks to the heavens and cries out: "Oh God, why did you do this to 
me?" 
</P>
<P>
 A voice from heaven sounds out: "Sorry Bernie, I didn't recognize you."

 Reader Del Wells recalls an incident that happened 44 years ago in Burbank: 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen children were swimming in his new homemade pool. A chemist at Lockheed 
had assembled half a dozen tubes for him to test for chlorine and he brought 
them home. The children watched as he compared a water sample from the pool 
with the test tubes: 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that?" one child asked.  
</P>
<P>
 I seized the opportunity and replied: "Now I will be able to tell who doesn't 
know the way to the bathroom."  
</P>
<P>
 I completed the test and looked around to a silent, deserted back yard. I 
didn't swim for a couple days.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; SOAP OPERA CLOAKS PREMISE OF NEAR-MYTHIC PROPORTIONS; THE 
TRACK OF REAL DESIRES BY BEVERLY LOWRY ; KNOPF; $21, 220 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Connections were what people long for, a sense of what was going on," writes 
Beverly Lowry of one character in her latest novel, "The Track of Real 
Desires." "Hers was a talent for compression, isolation and choice. Chuck out 
the chaff, fix on the wheat; forget the general picture and eyeball details." 
</P>
<P>
 With these few words, Lowry has described herself and her own powers as a 
storyteller. She needs only a couple hundred pages to give us the tale of a 
woman named Leland Standard and her sentimental journey to the little town of 
Eunola in the Mississippi Delta where she grew up. But Lowry manages to make 
every connection that counts, and her eye falls on every telling detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has been pursuing her career as a dancer on both coasts, New York and Los 
Angeles, and now she returns with her adolescent son, Toby, on a sentimental 
journey to Eunola. What she finds, after an absence of 35 years or so, is a 
strange new world, a kind of torqued and twisted version of the New South. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, when an aging belle goes on an eating binge, she gobbles garlic 
bagel chips. The elderly widow who operates the switchboard at the local 
nursing home has figured out how to apply for government grants to acquire a 
battery of high-tech communications equipment. And a failed cotton grower who 
bungles an attempt at suicide writes a successful book about it: "How to Lose 
Your Farm and Hold On to Your Life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mississippi had a film commission," observes Lowry. "Farmers were growing 
funny lettuce. The yellow pages had to put in a new classification for 
consultancies. People made it up as they went, working in their homes at their 
PCs and printers and answering and recording and fax machines." 
</P>
<P>
 The return of the prodigal daughter prompts a frenzy of self-assessment and 
self-revelation among her old friends in Eunola, and Lowry -- a master of the 
private moment, the secret thought, the overheard conversation -- rings all the 
changes on the plight of women who are "facing the gynecological end of the 
line" and fighting fiercely to stay fully alive. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, we meet Melanie Farrish, a woman with a defeated husband, a 
weirded-out son, an ill-mannered dog named Lady MacBeth, and a daughter who 
killed herself at 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her left eye twitched. What was it this time -- Xanax, Prozac, or plain old 
Popov? She was supposed to be off everything, though with Mell you never knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the former Mildred Sissy Pruett, now Sissy Westerfield, once 
voted "Most Talented" as a flirtatious young woman, now content to cinch up her 
ample flesh in cleverly engineered undergarments from Victoria's Secret and 
admire herself in the mirror in a literally carnal way. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are F-period-A-period-T," she scolds herself. But when she finishes with 
a private moment of self-love and dresses herself up in silk, Sissy is content 
with what she beholds: "Eat your heart out, Leland Standard," she declares. 
"Eat out your fit, skinny L.A. heart." 
</P>
<P>
 And we meet Jane Scott Laws, also known as "Jane Slut Laws" by her lover's 
wife. Jane returned to Eunola after a "lesbian fling" in San Francisco and took 
up the pursuit of married men in general and one married man, nicknamed Dog, in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, the way to get by in the Delta was to drink hard and hold on 
to your eccentricities," writes Lowry. "Jane Scott was working at both." 
</P>
<P>
 All of these women, plus an assortment of male consorts and miscellaneous 
children, gather for the dinner party that becomes the set piece of Lowry's 
book: "A general evening-up of whatever scores of whichever old and lost games 
were being played and kept." Slowly, agonizingly, dangerously but deliciously, 
each secret struggles to reveal itself -- and sometimes with shattering 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 The intimate secrets of Lee Standard and her son and her friends, which I 
shall not reveal here, are the standard elements of soap opera: abortion, 
infidelity, illegitimate birth, various kinds of illness, and various 
permutations of human sexuality. But there's something almost mythic in the 
premise of Lowry's book, something that is both deeply familiar and profoundly 
disturbing, and that's what makes "The Track of Real Desires" such a memorable 
and even haunting book.

GIVING A NEW PERSPECTIVE TO THE ART OF MEXICO; EXHIBITION: WITH 'LAS NUEVAS 
MAJAS,' WHICH SHOWCASES 11 FEMALE ARTISTS WORKING IN MEXICO CITY, CURATOR MARIA 
GUERRA HOPES TO BREAK DOWN ARTISTIC AND SOCIAL BARRIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALISA TAGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mexican curator Maria Guerra begins talking about "Las Nuevas Majas," an 
exhibition of work by 11 female artists working in Mexico City, she is composed 
and erudite. As the conversation continues about the show she organized at Otis 
Art Gallery, Guerra's surface cool gradually peels away and she becomes 
animated and ardent. 
</P>
<P>
 She believes that her exhibition might shake national distinctions and rattle 
gender divisions. "The work in the show is not feminist or post-feminist, it is 
made by women, and that's just the way it is. It needn't be so purposeful or 
definitive. I want the exhibition to be read as you read any other exhibition 
without focusing exclusively on gender." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's title, "majas" is difficult to translate. It means women who are 
elegant and confident with significant depth of character. It also plays on the 
title of Goya's famous paintings "Las Majas," which depict the woman as muse 
and provocateur . So, Guerra's title might loosely be translated as "The New 
Contemporary Women," with myriad connotations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 artists in Guerra's show live and work in Mexico, but are natives of 
Cuba, England, Mexico and Spain. Guerra notes that "there's a big history of 
foreign artists in Mexico and we adopt them, they are part of the scene. It's 
not necessarily important to distinguish their original nationality." 
</P>
<P>
 A former sculptor and performance artist, Guerra, 36, has become one of 
Mexico's most innovative curators. Her enthusiasm and keen intelligence are 
infused with large doses of humor and irony, which feed into her effusive 
character and professional endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra is something of a cultural maven. Elegant and flamboyant, with curly 
red hair framing her twinkling eyes and generous smile, her graceful silk 
outfit and diminutive stature contrast dramatically with her determined gait 
and rapid-fire pace. A self-appointed cultural ambassador and aspiring 
institution-builder, her goal is to break down artistic and social barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Mexico, Guerra has spent almost half her life in the United 
States and Europe. She studied at UC Santa Cruz, the Kansas City Art Institute 
and briefly at Harvard. During the past decade, Guerra has moved between 
Mexico, New York, London and Zurich, where she has been both an artist and a 
curator. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena invited Guerra to curate 
a show coinciding with the artistic extravaganza "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty 
Centuries," then at LACMA. By showcasing artists who live in Mexico, but whose 
ideas are not limited to national identity, Guerra's show "Another Mexican Art" 
undermined the expectations of a traditional art in Mexico, a history steeped 
in pictorialism and folklore. It also stood out amid the plethora of 
Mexico-inspired exhibitions, and was the beginning of Guerra's relationship 
with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In her typically ebullient fashion she explains, "You have to begin 
establishing links because they start to build up. I am particularly interested 
in the connection between Mexico and Los Angeles because I want the art world 
to shift a little bit west (from New York). It's time and there are a lot of 
really good things going on in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitions like Guerra's are changing the way art from south of the border is 
seen and interpreted. Frequently thought to be mythical and strictly 
representational, art from Latin America has actually paralleled movements in 
the United States and elsewhere. Guerra seeks to break down preconceptions of 
what Mexican art is about. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra is now working on several shows of new art from Mexico, which she plans 
to bring to Los Angeles. She is also organizing an exhibition of painting from 
Los Angeles that she hopes to bring to Mexico City in 1995. Most of the 
cutting-edge art coming out of Mexico is object-oriented because, Guerra 
believes, there is a built-in bias against painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico, we have a pictorial tradition of painting, and now it's a pity 
because there are so many good painters there, but they believe that they are 
not allowed to think. In the art schools in Mexico, the teachers tell the 
students, 'Don't think! Let the brush think for you.' This is the complete 
opposite of L.A. -- people here are painting and putting lots of thoughts and 
ideas and concepts into painting. I think it's important that in Mexico they 
see the exciting work that's going on. I want to restore the faith of painting 
in Mexico!" 
</P>
<P>
 Such a sentiment is typical of the goals that Guerra sets for herself. Over 
the past few years, she has been trying to establish a foundation of 
contemporary art in Mexico City. She envisions an organization that will 
promote the exchange of art and ideas, importing and exporting artists, critics 
and curators. Attempting to bridge government and private interests and to 
overcome deep-seated prejudices, Guerra is forging forward. 
</P>
<P>
 She has recently collaborated with a Mexico-based international forum on 
critical theory, and she is on the advisory board for a new art school that 
will radically change the approach to educating Mexican artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to broaden the way people look at art in Mexico. It's a very 
interesting and exciting time there in terms of having alternative ways of 
showing work outside of galleries and official venues where you are obliged to 
organize exhibitions that are compromised." 
</P>
<P>
 She says that the outcome of most of her projects is contingent upon the 
upcoming elections in Mexico. "It's very frightening how things are developing 
in Mexico. I mean, I love it, I love to be a part of it, but I don't understand 
how things end up changing so drastically every six years. There's no 
continuity, especially in the cultural positions, which is very unsettling. I 
hope that the politics of culture change drastically. In Mexico, the situation 
is very interesting, but very tough." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Las Nuevas Majas" continues through Aug. 26 at the Otis Gallery at Otis 
College of Art and Design, 2401 Wilshire Blvd. Hours are Tue.-Sat. , 10 a.m.-5

MOVIE REVIEW; 'I LOVE TROUBLE' -- YES, INDEED; NOLTE, ROBERTS AND NEWSPRINT. 
LIGHT AND FROTHY IT ISN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a good thing "I Love Trouble" loves trouble, because trouble is just what 
it's in. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte beaming out at the world from "Trouble" 
posters everywhere point to a light and frothy concoction, that's not what 
filmmaking team Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer (she produces, he directs, they 
both write) have delivered. On screens instead is a stab at the kind of 
thriller/romance combination that Alfred Hitchcock turned out in treats like 
"North by Northwest." 
</P>
<P>
 But, instead of the charm and the suspense complementing each other in the 
classic manner, they drag each other down. The film's jeopardy sequences are 
ineffectual and cast a pall over the romantic comedy aspects, which are not 
especially entrancing despite the star power. Instead of synergy, what 
"Trouble" achieves is more like disappointment squared. 
</P>
<P>
 No one expects movies like this one, set as it is in the largely mythological 
world of fiercely competitive daily newspapering, to be realistic. But neither 
should they be as flaccid and unconvincing as what we are presented with here. 
</P>
<P>
 After a pro forma opening setting up the thriller parts of the plot, Peter 
Brackett (Nolte) makes an appearance kissing a willing blonde in a fancy 
convertible. "Meet the Press" indeed. Although he still pulls down the big 
bucks as the city columnist for the Chicago Chronicle, Brackett is clearly more 
interested in promoting his new novel and chasing skirts than corralling a 
Pulitzer Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 What changes his mind is meeting Sabrina Peterson (Julia Roberts), the new 
face at the rival Chicago Globe. The two meet when both are assigned to cover 
the same train wreck, and Brackett feels all his instincts, competitive and 
otherwise, start to go into action. Peterson, however, is business personified 
and gives Brackett such a chilly brushoff it's surprising the movie doesn't end 
right there. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, to no one's surprise but their own, these two find their lives 
increasingly intertwined. First they go toe to toe on the wreck story, snarling 
at each other and trading scoops on a story their papers inexplicably view as 
bigger than the sinking of the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when developments lead them to a more complicated and dangerous 
situation, Brackett suggests they pool their skills. "If you knew what I knew 
and I knew what you knew," he theorizes in a rare moment of logic, "maybe we 
could live through this story." Peterson grudgingly sees his point and a 
reluctant collaboration is on. 
</P>
<P>
 There are clever moments in "I Love Trouble," odd times when the concept that 
amused Meyers and Shyer, a pair of rascals trying to both cooperate and out-con 
each other, is fleetingly visible. But mostly what we see is an unconvincing 
attempt at entertainment that is not good enough any way you look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one glance at the gripping opening elevator scene in "Speed," for 
instance, illustrates how ineffectual a similar situation in "Trouble" is. 
Neither Meyers nor Shyer has any previous experience turning out jeopardy 
material, and this is not an area where on-the-job training is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 What this team has been good at, most notably in the perennially 
underappreciated "Irreconcilable Differences" as well as their successful 
"Father of the Bride" remake, is writing glib, amusing dialogue. Here, however, 
perhaps because they were sidetracked coping with the thriller aspects, the 
repartee is mostly lackluster, something that not even the inordinate number of 
editors involved in the project can remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for the second time in two movies, Roberts finds herself thoughtlessly 
misused. An actress with an unbeatable smile who can effortlessly project 
warmth and good cheer, she spends far too much of this movie, as she did in 
"The Pelican Brief," looking somber and glum when she isn't being the focus of 
sporadic and insipid ogling. Unless everyone concerned wakes up and remembers 
what her celebrity is based on, Roberts' career could end up in considerable 
trouble itself. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SOUNDS OF BLACKNESS: NOT ITS USUAL SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When in peak form, Sounds of Blackness can blow the roof off any club. But on 
Monday the roof of the House of Blues was never in any danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the large ensemble, which uses a gospel format to sing all kinds of 
black music, occasionally generated blasts of gospel-style fervor, there were 
no genuinely electrifying numbers -- and for this group, electrifying has 
become routine. Though the harmonizing was far from ragged, it wasn't nearly as 
crisp as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 But even a relatively lethargic Sounds set has more energy and boasts more 
high-caliber singing than most R&B shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing side by side and backed by a combo, the 13 singers wailed mostly R&B, 
gospel and hip-hop. There were only hints of jazz, and the major foray into 
blues was surprisingly limp. The show showcased inspirational material from the 
group's current album, "Africa to America: The Journey of the Drum," such as "I 
Believe," "The Harder They Are the Bigger They Fall" and "A Place in My Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 A model of democracy, the group rotates lead singers, though Ann Bennett-Nesby 
gets the most leads. Normally just a cut below Aretha Franklin, Bennett-Nesby 
didn't wail with her usual intensity on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 On some songs the group was clearly hampered by the standard House of Blues 
sound problem -- a drop in quality anywhere outside the main floor -- which 
seemed more severe than usual. DENNIS HUNT

THEATER REVIEW; 'ACT ONE' MAY BE READY FOR PRIME TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How serious is cable TV about finding new programming for the much-vaunted 
500-channel future? Serious enough that the industry is planting theater 
seedlings that some day might grow into prime-time oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Showtime Networks is co-producing "Act One: A Festival of Fifteen New One-Act 
Plays" at the Met Theatre in Hollywood. The final installment, a slightly 
overlong bill of five playlets dubbed "Evening C," runs through July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 How well these staged pilots will translate to the small screen is anyone's 
guess. Yet as theatrical chamber pieces, most of them come as a very pleasant 
surprise, sharply written and engagingly acted by some relatively big-name 
writers and players. 
</P>
<P>
 The best is "Rosemary with Ginger," Edward Allan Baker's spicy domestic blood 
bath that plays like a gender-reversed retread of Sam Shepard's "True West." 
Briefly reunited in a shuttered diner, working-class sisters Ginger (Lucinda 
Jenney) and Rosemary (Susan Barnes) circle like dueling bobcats as they relive 
their hellish childhood and agonizing marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 While the material itself is depressing, director Paul McCrane has managed to 
mine earthy humor amid the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as effective is Craig Lucas' "The Dying Gaul," which adds a gay-themed 
twist to the old story about the naive screenwriter in Hollywood. This time 
around, young scribe Robert (Steven Antin) is offered a Faustian bargain by an 
unctuous Disney executive named Roger (Jerry Levine). 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas treads no new ground here, but the play nevertheless feels fresh and 
funny, largely because of Antin's wide-eyed innocence and Levine's hilariously 
smarmy insincerity. Harris Yulin directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Martin's "Waltzing De Niro" and Bryan Goluboff's "The Other Five Percent" 
are more sporadically entertaining three-character works, though each is 
blessed with a high-spirited lead performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the intriguing fantasy "De Niro," a young woman falls in love with a 
next-door neighbor who may or may not be Robert De Niro. Director Stephanie 
Shroyer allows the pacing to slacken at times, though Scott Alan Campbell's 
mugging impersonation of the "GoodFellas" star is a real hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Elias Koteas likewise turns in a forceful, memorable performance as a onetime 
high school jock whose life has hit the skids in the somewhat sinister "Five 
Percent," with direction from Arliss Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's big disappointment -- considering the acting talent involved -- 
is "Tinkle Time," Dana Coen's lifeless and unfunny skit about a U.S. president 
(Howard Hesseman, of TV sitcom fame) and his top adviser (Harry Shearer) forced 
to visit a run-down public toilet during a campaign whistle-stop. 
Unfortunately, the premise just devolves into platitudes about arrogant public 
figures deaf to the needs and opinions of their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of approach you see all the time on -- dare we say it? -- TV 
sitcoms.

MOVIE REVIEW; AND A LITTLE CHILD SHALL MANAGE THEM; 'LITTLE BIG LEAGUE' IS AN 
ADULT'S BASEBALL FANTASY RETOOLED FOR TYKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Little Big League," 12-year-old baseball maven Billy Heywood (Luke 
Edwards) inherits the general managership of the Minnesota Twins from his 
grandfather (Jason Robards) and ends up becoming the team's manager too. It's 
yet another Hollywood high concept in the burgeoning baseball movie cottage 
industry. But think about it -- is it really every boy's fantasy to manage a 
ball club? 
</P>
<P>
 What seems more likely is that "Little Big League" is an adult's baseball 
fantasy retooled for tykes. After all, a boy would more likely fantasize 
himself a slugger who wins the game for his team with a bases-loaded home run; 
the adult fantasy is to be that team's CEO. "Little Big League" tries to 
reconcile two conflicting scenarios: It gives us baseball as a game for the 
child within all of us but then it makes that child a corporate honcho. It's 
the perfect split for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy, of course, isn't much of a player on the field -- we can identify 
better with him that way. But this Little Big Man knows every bit of baseball 
lore since the days of Abner Doubleday and he's a master tactician, too; he 
even knows how to psych out the troublemakers on his team and cajole their 
prowess. He brings the Twins from the cellar to pennant contention and he does 
it by making baseball fun again. That's his philosophy -- forget winning or 
losing, forget the money, just have fun. Of course, the filmmakers have it both 
ways on this, too: All this baseball-as-fun stuff points toward fame and 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Director Andrew Scheinman and screenwriters Gregory Pincus and Adam Scheinman 
don't really delve into what it might be like for a 12-year-old to own and 
manage a baseball team; they don't really get into the ways in which the sport 
has been corporatized and how that would affect what a manager can do. Some of 
the players are surly, and one -- Billy's childhood idol -- has to be let go, 
but you won't be seeing any Darryl Strawberrys on this club. "Little Big 
League" isn't really in a position to jab the corporate sports culture because 
a movie with this hard a sell implicitly endorses that culture. It's Hollywood 
hardball masquerading as whiffle ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy would have been more interesting if he demonstrated some surly sides of 
his own, but he's drearily saintly and precocious. This fatherless boy has a 
weak spell when one of the players (Timothy Busfield) woos his mom (Ashley 
Crowe) and finds himself inexplicably benched. But that's about as petty as 
Billy gets -- oh yes, he also forgets to go fishing with his buddies (Billy L. 
Sullivan and Miles Feulner) when he gets a lunch offer from Reggie Jackson. 
Excuuuuse me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Billy picks up a few life lessons along the way -- not much mention is made of 
the school lessons he'll have to make up -- but most of the wisdom emanates 
from the boy. And if he seems wise beyond his years, that's because baseball 
here is employed as a metaphor for life. He who masters the game masters life. 
The field of dreams is soggy with sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time director Andrew Scheinman -- one of the partners in Castle Rock 
Entertainment -- may have too much of the Billy in himself to bring out the 
true roisterousness of baseball. He manages the movie with too soft a touch. 
The film's injected pathos isn't true to what most adults respond to in the 
sport -- let alone children. It's a movie about "growing up" -- i.e., becoming 
responsible. But the best, the least pretentious baseball movies have always 
been about how the game can make you blessedly irresponsible.

LONGER 'WOODSTOCK' STILL PRIME VIEWING; MOVIE REVIEW: THE 25TH-ANNIVERSARY 
DIRECTOR'S CUT INCLUDES 44 MINUTES OF PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN FOOTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The reissue of the Oscar-winning documentary "Woodstock" (at Mann's Chinese 
Theater and South Coast Plaza in Orange County) in a 25th-anniversary 
director's cut is vital, if it serves only as a utopian corrective -- in 
advance -- for August's inevitably cynicism-inspiring Woodstock '94 festival. 
</P>
<P>
 A new generation can now marvel at the sight of the original fest's hippie 
promoters grinning goofily as they announced they'd lose millions by letting 
the advancing hordes in for nothing. It was the last great gasp of free love 
and free admission; expect this August's cash cow at Yasgur's farm to be 
fortified by something a little sturdier than wire mesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Michael Wadleigh has fortified his "Woodstock" by adding 44 minutes 
of previously unseen footage to his already three-hour-plus document. It's 
either a measure of how well cut this is or how dreadful a lot of this summer's 
new two- and three-hour dramas are, but it actually doesn't seem that 
unbearably long, even when Wadleigh starts the second half with restored 
outtakes of the less-than-prime Jefferson Airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as ever, "Woodstock" is not just a great slice-of-time documentary but 
still the ultimate rock concert movie: A quarter-century of advances hasn't 
brought about any real improvements on the multiple-camera filming techniques 
or even significantly dated the split-screen effects and varying aspect ratio 
tricks. The advent of digital sound, on the other hand, has given the remixed 
soundtrack a theatrical glory unknown a generation ago. At this pristine 
volume, Jimi Hendrix's concluding bit may not be quite suitable for anyone with 
a heart condition, which would constitute more of the Woodstock nation than 
some of us might like to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woodstock" may be a slightly better film for being longer, but it's the 
familiar material that's the best reason to go back: Pete Townshend's windmill 
guitar strums. The nun flashing the peace sign. The gentle "brown acid" stage 
caveats, by now as familiar -- and misquoted -- a part of movie lingo as "Play 
it again, Sam." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the new stuff, you get a good deal more documentary footage, a little 
more of Hendrix, Canned Heat and the Airplane, and Janis Joplin as part of the 
film for the very first time, with "Work Me, Lord" a very good if not quite 
defining performance.  
</P>
<P>
 The most notable musical addition is the insertion into the standing Hendrix 
footage of "Voodoo Chile," shot on the last day as most of the weather-beaten 
crowd had already started slouching back to civilization. It's a measure of how 
powerful a document of a faded dream Wadleigh's "Woodstock" is that the 
anticlimactic shots of the emptying, litter-filled fields laid under Hendrix's 
scorching notes make you feel intractably and unexpectedly sad that they, or 
we, ever had to go home.

TV REVIEW; SELF-DEFENSE FOR KIDS: CAN IT GO TOO FAR? 
</P>

<P>
 Could a fragile-looking little girl disarm a knife-wielding male kidnaper and 
then disable him? 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Gallen, who runs a controversial child safety program called The 
Defense Department, says yes.Pat Hines, who founded her own children's program, 
Safe Moves, and Ellen Snortland, a teacher in yet another program, Kidpower, 
say the claim is "ridiculous." Hines says that making a child think such a 
thing is possible is "irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three programs, designed to give children protection from the 
world's dangers, are profiled on KCET-TV's "Life & Times," tonight at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallen, with in-your-face intensity, exposes her young trainees, ages 7 to 13, 
to graphic scenarios of abduction and sexual attack, acted out by adult male 
assailants in padded protective gear. Parents look on as children are coached 
to defend themselves through physical violence. One little girl is urged to 
slice her attacker's hamstrings and then his throat. Gallen says that parents 
who don't want their children to know such things are setting them up to be 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Snortland soft-pedals specifics, stressing "awareness and confidence" to help 
children avoid dangerous situations. She teaches them ways to strike out only 
in order to get away. 
</P>
<P>
 Hines points out that children are many more times likely to be seriously 
injured or killed riding a bicycle or walking across a street, and focuses 
strictly on that. 
</P>
<P>
 How much do children need to know? At what age? Does graphically teaching 
children the rudiments of maiming and killing truly make them safer? Do they 
pay an emotional price? The Polly Klaas tragedy is referred to repeatedly. 
Disturbing questions; no clear answers. Afterward, viewer response is 
requested.

 Scotty, beam me to Parker Center!In a new book on the late Gene Roddenberry, 
the creator of "Star Trek" revealed that when he was a Los Angeles police 
officer, "some people (thought) that my natural future was to become chief of 
police." 
</P>
<P>
 As the LAPD's equivalent of Capt. Kirk, he hinted, there might have been 
similarities with the Starship Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . I had decided that when I became chief of police, I would bring along 
with me new attitudes and new uniforms," he said in "Gene Roddenberry: The Last 
Conversation," by Yvonne Fern. 
</P>
<P>
 We could imagine the Men in Blue being transformed into the Men in Orange -- 
with those crew-necked, stretch pullovers. 
</P>
<P>
 And Roddenberry, who was a sergeant when he left the LAPD in 1953, also would 
have equipped his cops with more sophisticated weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like phasers?" asked author Fern. 
</P>

 "Like phasers," he responded.

the courts might frown upon.

 And he had to be in by 10 p.m.: Aaron Wilcox notes that Dick Clark -- 
America's oldest teen-ager -- was busy, busy, busy last Saturday. At 8:30 p.m., 
he could be seen hosting an "American Bandstand" retrospective on NBC while 
simultaneously being inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences 
Hall of Fame on rival ABC.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not only doesn't he seem to age with time," Wilcox said, "he seems to be 
getting more and more virile every day. I'm 25 and I don't think I could handle 
racing from studio to studio like that."

 An end to mudslinging? Karen Streisand of San Pedro found a restaurant ad for 
what sounded like a refreshingly clean political event. Obviously it wasn't

been very complimentary toward each other.

 Orange coneheads: Ron Rieder of Sherman Oaks notes that under emergency 
conditions, it took Caltrans crews less than three months to put the Santa 
Monica Freeway back together. But, Caltrans said recently, the re-striping of 
10 miles of the San Diego Freeway to create a car-pool lane will take more than 
two years. "Sounds like we are back to pre-earthquake government construction 
schedules," Rieder noted.

 Off-boulevard: Inasmuch as Faye Dunaway has been bounced from the musical in

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; KEY MENENDEZ 
HEARING RESCHEDULED FOR TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A key hearing in the Menendez brothers' murder trial was postponed until today 
because of a defense attorney's family emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Bill Weiss did not appear at a hearing Monday before 
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg, and co-counsel Terri Towery 
told Weisberg there had been an accident involving someone in Weiss' family 
over the weekend.At Towery's request, the judge rescheduled the hearing for 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, remain in County Jail without bail, 
awaiting a retrial in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents. At 
their first trial, separate juries deadlocked between murder and lesser 
manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Weisberg is due to fix a date for the brothers' retrial, to decide 
whether the brothers will be tried together or apart, to pick between one jury 
or two if they are tried together, and to decide whether the retrial will be 
held in Van Nuys or another county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge postponed until July 22 a hearing on a prosecution bid to obtain 
audiotapes from free-lance journalist Robert Rand.

FAIR WAY TO HIKE THE BUS FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The directors of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are supposed to 
approve their operating budget for the next fiscal year when they meet today. 
But don't expect that to happen, because a $126-million operating deficit looms 
for the super- agency that must run the nation's biggest municipal bus fleet 
while also building the country's biggest public works project -- the ambitious 
regional system of subways and trolleys designed to give Los Angeles a 
21st-Century mass transit system.  
</P>
<P>
 Something has got to give if the MTA -- created two years ago in a merger of 
the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission and the Southern California 
Rapid Transit District -- is going to keep everything on its busy transit 
agenda rolling. The MTA's capable chief executive officer, Franklin E. White, 
has asked the board to combine a modest fare increase with cutbacks in service, 
while also slowing some of the MTA's construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 White's case for a fare increase is persuasive. The proposed hike would be the 
first for the MTA in six years. It is also modest -- ranging from 10 to 25 
cents per ride in most cases. It should definitely be approved -- but not right 
away. White's budget balancing act will work only if the necessary steps are 
taken in the right order. He is making a mistake putting a fare hike at the top 
of the agenda when it is really the last thing the board should consider. MTA 
directors must postpone that painful step until they deal with an even bigger 
challenge: a labor contract that is far too costly and prevents the MTA from 
operating as efficiently as it can. 
</P>
<P>
 That contract expires this week, and changing it could be every bit as 
difficult as getting a fare increase in the face of some angry public 
opposition. The unions that represent MTA drivers and mechanics have called bus 
strikes before and may do it again. That's one reason MTA employees are among 
the best-paid transit workers in the nation. But they must understand that 
economic conditions have changed since their last contract was signed, in 1991. 
A long California recession has lowered the MTA's sales tax and fare-box 
revenues. And the construction money flowing into the MTA was earmarked by 
Congress, the Legislature and the voters for specific new rail projects; it 
would be irresponsible to use those funds for operating expenses, although it 
would be legal in some instances. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness to White, this difficult budget matter is really beyond his 
control. He has laid out a reasonable plan, one that is doable with 
modifications. It is up to the MTA board, 13 elected officials including Mayor 
Richard Riordan and the five county supervisors, to make it work by showing 
some creativity and no small amount of political courage. That means raising 
fares -- but only after persuading MTA employees to share the pain along with 
their riders.

IT'S TIME FOR THEIR 'LUCK' TO END; CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS' PURCHASES OF NEW 
STOCK OFFERINGS SHOULD BE BANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apologists for the practice keep reciting, like a mantra, that there's nothing 
in the law or in the rules of the House or Senate to prevent a member of 
Congress from accepting first crack at buying usually lucrative new stock 
offerings. True, though this is really a shamelessly pathetic defense for 
something that is so transparently corrupting. 
</P>
<P>
 A senator or representative who is invited to profit through the purchase of a 
hot new initial public stock offering (IPO) incurs an obligation to whoever 
arranged the deal: You did me a favor, now I owe you one. Even someone with the 
most rudimentary sense of what constitutes ethical behavior, say a child of 4, 
can figure that out. It's insulting to argue that just because there's no 
specific ban in law, or in the ethical standards Congress writes for itself, 
such flagrant influence-buying therefore deserves to be seen as right or 
permissible. All that the absence of a ban shows is that the law and the 
standards both need toughening. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) made a quick $37,000 profit buying and 
selling the initial public offering in a small California computer company. Was 
he just lucky? He was lucky indeed to be the ranking Republican on the Banking 
Committee, which among other things oversees the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. At the time that D'Amato scored so big his stockbroker happened to 
be under investigation by the SEC for fraudulent sales practices and stock 
manipulation. Quelle surprise! , as Miss Piggy would say. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato has plenty of company in the shady glades of congressional ethics. In 
the last two years Sens. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.) and Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) have reported profiting from IPOs. So, 
among others, have Reps. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.), Gary L. Ackerman 
(D-N.Y.) and Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.) made 42 trades in IPOs in less than four years, earning more than 
$100,000.

 Some of the people named above would argue that as major investors they would 
be cut in on IPO deals even if they weren't in Congress. Such offers are 
regularly made by brokers to favored customers, to the annoyance of small 
investors. But that argument ignores the self-evident fact that as soon as they 
took their oaths of office their private financial affairs became subject to a 
degree of public scrutiny, the object of which was to detect any potential 
interest conflicts. Whenever anyone in government participates in a lucrative 
IPO deal such a conflict occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the problem. The remedy is apparent: A flat ban on IPO trades for 
anyone in government who remotely could be influenced by such acts of 
favoritism.

CHICKEN BOWLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On opening The Times on June 17, I found something that disturbed me greatly. 
On A2 there was a picture of a refugee in Rwanda who is struggling to recover 
from malnutrition.On the following page there was an article about the "chicken 
war" featuring a picture of "chicken bowling." Chicken bowling involves using a 
frozen chicken as a bowling ball. 
</P>
<P>
 On seeing these two pictures I became so angry and ashamed of being an 
American. The people in this country cannot possibly begin to understand the 
suffering that the people of Rwanda and other people in the Third World 
countries have to endure. Yet it seems that we don't care, when I look at the 
paper in the morning and see "chicken bowling" in the front section. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not asking you to set out and change the world. I am a 17-year-old who 
wishes that with one wave of the wand all could be set right in the world. I 
know that this can't happen. I had to, however, let my voice be heard.

SENATE CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Michael Huffington moved from Texas to California just three years 
ago, purchasing a congressional seat for $5 million, and immediately started 
running for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, the ultimate opportunist, has nothing to say about his own 
accomplishments as a member of the Congress, instead resorting to distorting 
Democratic incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein's record. 
</P>
<P>
 He should win a chutzpah award for complaining about her tax payments, while 
refusing to release his own tax returns. What's he hiding? 
</P>
<P>
 Dianne Feinstein has represented California well, and her effectiveness is 
unusual for someone with just two years in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Huffington can buy as many television ads as he likes, but he has yet to 
show why he can do better than Sen. Feinstein, except in one area: misleading 
the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 BILL COLLINS

</P>
<P>
 Turning health care reform into a political football is not only symbolic of 
Washington gamesmanship but carries the potential of a contorted and 
irresponsible legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
 The current campaign for a Senate seat between Feinstein and Huffington 
promises to be a bloody battle along these lines ("Huffington Ad Blasts 
Feinstein's Shift on Health Care," June 18). 
</P>
<P>
 It is interesting that recently, in response to a letter I wrote to Feinstein 
on another subject, she enclosed a brochure supporting President Clinton's 
health plan. Since this was after removing her name as co-sponsor of this 
reform bill, it seems the California senator is trying to have it both ways!

POPULATION DISAGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So George Weigel (Column Right, June 16) is perturbed that President Clinton 
has dared to be in disagreement with Pope John Paul II over worldwide 
population control measures. Well, I have news for Weigel. 
</P>
<P>
 To non-Catholics, the majority of us, the Pope's claim that he speaks with the 
voice of God is outrageous. He may be a kind and decent man, but he is no more 
than that. He is a man. Elected to office by other men. Catholic women, a great 
many of whom are pro-birth control, had no say in his election. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Weigel's claim that our President's stance on population control is 
dictatorial, this is arrogance on a monumental level. It is the Catholic 
Church's dictum on birth control that is dictatorial. "Increase and multiply" 
is bringing this planet to ruin and if allowed to continue will starve the 
world back to the Dark Ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is right. Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church are dead wrong on 
this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 HENRY MILLER 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Weigel's commentary ("A Deep Split Between the U.S. and the Vatican") was 
mistitled. The real split on population policy is between the Vatican and 
virtually everyone else, including population experts, governments, global 
health advocates, and citizens of every nation who care about democracy and 
autonomy -- not to mention practicing Catholics, who overwhelmingly reject the 
church's teachings on birth control, and who do not believe in imposing narrow 
church doctrine on the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Weigel's assertion, the draft document for the Cairo conference is 
not "bitterly contested" except by representatives of the Holy See and a very 
few fundamentalist regimes. All other delegates are united behind the draft's 
realistic, compassionate and empowering approach to improving women's status, 
protecting individual rights, and expanding access to reproductive health care. 
To describe this consensus with shrieking epithets like "soft totalitarianism," 
"eugenic fevers," and "a truly Orwellian move" is preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
 Weigel says it's a tragedy that Bill Clinton won't kowtow to what he calls 
"the world's greatest moral authority." Never mind his offensive chauvinism and 
the fact that millions of people seek moral authority elsewhere. Never mind 
that poll after poll shows that even most Catholics feel the Pope doesn't speak 
for them on matters of reproduction. The real tragedy would be if a politically 
motivated cadre of religious radicals succeeded in derailing the most 
progressive and promising approach to population in history. Fortunately, the 
collective conscience of women's and population advocates worldwide will not 
allow that to happen.

 I just wanted to applaud you for publishing Weigel's politically incorrect, 
but penetratingly sound article. Weigel's point -- that the Western World is 
arrogantly and immorally exporting the failed notions of its sexual revolution 
to the Third World -- gets little play in the big media. Thanks for giving it 
some.

SIMPSON CASE TV COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision of your editors to include in your June 15 coverage of the O.J. 
Simpson case a feature piece designed to be critical of television's coverage 
of the murders was so competitively self-serving and hypocritical it demands my 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 "TV Coverage of Simpson Case Criticized" uses Michael Jackson's latest radio 
tirade against television news as the peg to construct yet another indictment 
of television as perpetrating a circus-type atmosphere in its coverage of the 
crime. The story aims to hold our newscasts solely responsible for somehow 
convicting O.J. Simpson of the murders prior to any formal charges. The article 
goes on to unfairly question not only the ethics of our reporting but the 
amount of newscast time that was devoted to the story. 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre irony in all of this, of course, is that the information contained 
in our reports June 13 and 14 was the same information and from the same 
sources which The Times deemed appropriate and important enough to place on its 
front page June 15 under "Police Sources Link Evidence to Simpson."  
</P>
<P>
 In what can only be viewed as a colossal flash of arrogance, the reprimand of 
television's alleged overzealousness sits plop in the middle of two facing 
pages devoted to the murders, totaling over 160 column inches! While we are 
called to justify the probity of giving nine minutes of our June 15 late 
newscast to the Simpson story with four reporters on the beat, The Times 
meanwhile published the bylines of 22 reporters working on the story. 
</P>
<P>
 What we have here is more than just a case of the pot calling the kettle 
black. I don't think most of the Simpson murder coverage to date by KCBS-TV or 
The Times has been overdone, or is unethical or unfair. This is, after all, a 
sensational story generating great public interest. No, an article like this 
appears, in as silly a fashion as it did, because even in a great paper like 
The Times there is always someone eager to take a whack at television news.

CROATIAN CURRENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your June 22 editorial, "Fearful Name From a Nazi Past," there are 
disturbing inaccuracies as well as significant omissions regarding the recent 
introduction of the kuna as the Croatian currency. First, and most importantly, 
President Franjo Tudjman did not at any time override other authorities and 
"unilaterally change" the name of the currency.The action was taken in the 
Croatian Parliament, after a lengthy multi-party debate which resulted in the 
adoption of the name. Second, while the kuna was the name of the currency 
during the short period between 1941-45, the kuna enjoys a long history in 
Croatia as a unit of trade dating from the Sixth Century, and appeared on coins 
as early as 1256.  
</P>
<P>
 In light of all the positive steps President Tudjman has taken to improve 
relations with and address concerns of the Jewish and Serbian communities, it 
is the height of cynicism to suggest that he, a Partisan war hero, is in any 
way a proponent of "neo-fascism." It would be more accurate to say that he, as 
well as the majority of Croatians, rejects the transparent attempts of those 
who oppose any and all Croatian cultural and historical symbols, regardless of 
their origins, and apparently prefer those under which Croatians and others 
suffered and died in the former Yugoslav totalitarian state.

HIS 'CRIME' RESULTS IN A GAIN FOR THE PUBLIC; WHISTLE-BLOWER: STATE EMPLOYEES 
WHO REPORT MISCONDUCT SHOULD NOT DO SO AT RISK OF BEING FIRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH ROSEN, Ruth Rosen, a professor of history at UC Davis, writes regularly 
on political culture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do state employees owe greater allegiance to a corrupt public agency than to 
the people of California, whom they actually serve? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, that is why John Plotz, a veteran attorney for the California 
Commission on Judicial Performance, is locked out of his office and threatened 
with termination. His "crime" is that he criticized the commission to a friend, 
thereby instigating legislation that would hold California judges accountable 
to judicial ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, California's courts will be more just. But justice also demands 
that Plotz be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commission on Judicial Performance, a little-known state agency, is 
mandated by the California Constitution to expose judicial misconduct and to 
remove corrupt, dishonest and grossly incompetent judges. Unfortunately, the 
commission in recent years has failed dismally. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of several investigators, Plotz was positioned to observe the 
commission's leniency toward judicial misconduct and incompetence. Some of the 
cases he witnessed included receipt of gifts from lawyers and litigants 
appearing before a judge, sexual harassment of court employees, destruction of 
evidence, arbitrary jailings of lawyers or litigants and gross abuse of 
ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Plotz's observations have been substantiated by others. Prof. Stephen Barnett 
of the UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, an expert on the state's 
judicial system, has said that the commission's "name should be changed to the 
'Commission for Judicial Protection.' " A three-month investigation by the San 
Francisco Chronicle recently disclosed that the panel has not voted to publicly 
censure or remove a single judge since 1988. Yet during the nine previous 
years, 19 judges were censured or removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
 California trails the nation in disciplining wayward judges. Since 1980, the 
commission has removed less than half the national average. (It would be naive 
to assume that California judges differ that much from their peers.) Gerald 
Stern, the head of New York's counterpart commission, notes that "At our annual 
national meetings, we mock our California colleagues . . . . I don't understand 
how their commission can let some of those cases go as private admonishments." 
</P>
<P>
 Without disclosing any confidential information, Plotz discussed his concerns 
with a friend, Peter G. Keane, chief attorney of the San Francisco public 
defender's office and a member of the State Bar board of governors. Keane then 
wrote an article in which he recommended three substantive reforms: open 
disciplinary hearings of judges, add more non-judges to the panel and give the 
commission the authority to make its own rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature agreed with these reforms. Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose) 
introduced the most comprehensive measure, which has now passed committees in 
both the Assembly and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of John Plotz? 
</P>
<P>
 For his efforts, Plotz -- whose file reveals a six-year unblemished, exemplary 
record -- was subjected to a disciplinary interrogation. The commission's 
position is that its employees have no right to criticize the agency outside 
the agency. Commission Director Victoria Henley threatened to fire Plotz if he 
did not reveal the substance of all his conversations with Keane. 
(Astonishingly, she cited McCarthy-era cases in which teachers were forced to 
disclose whether they had been members of the Communist Party.) Plotz received 
a disciplinary reprimand. Unwilling to be quietly fired, he informed the 
Legislature of the reprimand. Henley then placed him on indefinite 
"administrative leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly, the charge against Plotz is that he has violated the 
attorney-client privilege by informing the Legislature of his reprimand. This 
is a preposterous charge, for who was the client? Having betrayed no 
confidential information, Plotz rightfully claims his legal right to freedom of 
speech, as well as his moral obligation to protect the people of California 
from judicial misconduct.  
</P>
<P>
 This case may create an important precedent for state employees. If, as a 
public employee, I observe gross corruption and misconduct within my 
institution, do I owe allegiance to corrupt superiors or to the people of 
California who pay my salary?  
</P>
<P>
 The answer is clear. John Plotz should be honored, not punished. With 
integrity and courage, he has tried to ensure that justice is more than just a 
seven-letter word. And he has succeeded.

WE HAVE FOUND THE WAY, NOW WE NEED THE WILL; LAPD: THE PROPOSED SALARY INCREASE 
WON'T LIMIT THE NUMBER OF NEW HIRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD J. RIORDAN, Richard J. Riordan is the mayor of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two years, Los Angeles police officers have worked without a contract. 
Today, the City Council will consider a long-awaited contract with the Police 
Protective League. This important opportunity has been carved out of 
roller-coaster negotiations, haunted by strident police-union tactics and an 
antiquated "business as usual" system for solving labor disputes. LAPD officers 
deserve the raise this contract offers, and the council should swiftly adopt 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 When I became mayor last July, city government faced its worst fiscal crisis 
since the Great Depression, threatened by an estimated $200-million shortfall 
and a flat economy. Yet with a safer city the No. 1 priority, my administration 
has stubbornly focused on this goal, injecting innovation and belt-tightening 
in city operations to do so. The City Council embraced my core initiatives with 
few modifications. The result of our teamwork will be a significant increase in 
our police force -- the equivalent of more than 1,000 full-time officers in the 
coming year -- as well as the new equipment our police need to do their jobs, 
advances in Christopher Commission reforms, more community-based anti-graffiti 
programs, more programs for vulnerable youth. 
</P>
<P>
 But these important steps are not sufficient; a meaningful salary increase and 
patrol bonus for officers is needed. Over the years, LAPD compensation has 
lagged behind packages offered by other local law-enforcement agencies. Even 
with the base-pay increases proposed, Los Angeles officers will be paid between 
10% and 20% less than deputy sheriffs. LAPD officers on patrol now get no 
incentives for their tough work on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary increase the council will consider today will have no effect on the 
number of new hires. The increase will be financed by money already approved 
and from a police-overtime account for the coming year, rather than by a 
counterproductive tax increase or cut in services. By improving morale, 
decreasing attrition and collecting on the investment taxpayers have already 
made in trained officers, our police force will be more efficient and city 
residents and businesses will benefit. This is a balanced approach, built on 
common sense, which wisely diversifies the city's investment in public-safety 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that the "stretch budget" on which the police salary 
increase is based will require discipline and continued teamwork to reach our 
goals. Given state budget difficulties and other revenue uncertainties, some 
people question whether the city can afford this salary increase. We cannot 
afford not to. A safe city is the best welcome mat we can put out for the 
job-creating businesses we need.  
</P>
<P>
 This new contract also completes a year of great progress toward a safer city: 
We will have 383 new patrol cars with more on the way, a new police academy in 
Westchester with the capacity for large classes of recruits and increased 
resident involvement in crime-fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's approval of this police salary increase will be a fitting cap to 
these important strides. We have found the ways. All that is needed today is 
the will.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING PRESIDENT; ELECTION-SEASON 
TURMOIL, INCLUDING TREACHERY IN HIS OWN PARTY, DEMANDS A FIRM HAND, YET SALINAS 
HAS ALL BUT ABDICATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE DRESSER, Denise Dresser is a professor of political science at the 
Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has become an invisible man. As Mexico 
slouches from crisis to crisis, Salinas has become a mere figurehead who hands 
out prizes, inaugurates events, travels and creates government commissions, but 
no longer controls the country's destiny. His political death has left Mexico 
trapped in a stalemate and without the leadership it so desperately needs to 
assure a free and fair presidential election on Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone and alienated at Los Pinos, the presidential residence, Salinas watches 
passively as his once-loyal collaborators engage in political warfare and the 
country unravels. The candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI), Ernesto Zedillo, rarely mentions the president or his accomplishments; 
former peace commissioner (and Zedillo rival) Manuel Camacho Solis has left the 
Chiapas negotiations -- and hence the PRI-dominated political agenda -- in a 
lurch; guerrilla Subcommander Marcos has refused the presidential peace offer. 
Most recently, Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo attempted to resign his office, 
which supervises elections, charging that unspecified factions were trying to 
undermine the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's multiple political crises since the Chiapas revolt last January have 
revealed the flaws of a governing system built upon the political capital and 
the popularity of a single man. Salinas wanted to govern alone, and now he is 
alone. Faced with a turbulent country, a political class that cannibalizes 
itself and a national modernization project whose survival is at stake, Salinas 
has opted to remain silent, thus abandoning his presidential responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Salinas used the transformative power of the presidency to change 
Mexico's economic course; now he should tap into that reservoir and support 
Mexico's political evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 When the presidential succession was assured, it was natural for the incumbent 
to ease up in the last months of his term. In the turmoil of this election, 
being fiercely contested by three candidates, Mexico needs a fully active 
president, one who is committed to decent elections and a pluralistic 
government; a president respected for his activism in favor of democracy and 
not condemned for his absence; a president who understands political 
competition as an unqualified good and not as a necessary evil. Mexico does not 
need to resuscitate the caudillos; too many of them already inhabit the 
country's political class. However, the transition undoubtedly requires a 
helmsman. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas has the historic opportunity to reinvent himself as the statesman he 
strove unsuccessfully to become. He has the chance to be the first Mexican 
president committed to political opening, not to the survival -- at all costs 
-- of the PRI. Instead of handing over the keys of the political kingdom to the 
party's dinosaurs, he could support Carpizo's democratic efforts; instead of 
exiling himself at Los Pinos, he could seize the initiative and generate a 
widespread public consensus for peaceful, free and fair elections; instead of 
lobbying for a job abroad (as head of the new World Trade Organization), he 
should finish the work waiting at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-liners within the ruling party are attempting to take advantage of 
Salinas' abdication of leadership and launch a silent coup d'etat that would 
guarantee their political renaissance. The most competitive election in 
Mexico's history will bring together groups within the PRI that are hoping for 
fraud and groups that are willing -- or feel compelled -- to provide it. 
Zedillo's less-than-popular candidacy may put more pressure on the party 
machinery to generate votes and turn a blind eye to illegal practices, 
particularly in remote rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Renowned and respected as a human-rights advocate and informal electoral 
ombudsman, Carpizo has managed to bridge the chasm of distrust among Mexico's 
political parties. He tried to resign because he was unwilling to condone 
PRI-sponsored fraud and see his hard-earned reputation go up in smoke. To 
persuade Carpizo to stay on, Salinas made many promises, including the 
assurance of a squeaky-clean election. The question is whether he will keep his 
word and enforce it throughout the rank and file, even if the PRI loses.  
</P>
<P>
 Salinas has distinguished himself as a risk-taker and a high-stakes gambler. 
Thus it is paradoxical that when Mexico confronts him with the most significant 
challenge of his political career -- the democratic gamble -- the president 
wavers. If he does not rouse himself to action soon, history will have to judge 
Carlos Salinas as the incredible shrinking president who lost so much political 
weight by the end of his term that the presidential sash became too big for 
him.

A LA CARTE FROM THE HERO MENU; LETTING THE MEDIA ANOINT ATHLETES AS ROLE MODELS 
IS A PROBLEM THAT GOES BEYOND O. J. SIMPSON. CHARACTER IS WHAT COUNTS. 
</P>

 "Where would I be if there were no sports? Would I still be your hero?" 
Michael Jordan and Jackie Joyner-Kersee ask this question in a series of 
televised public-service announcements. It's an especially haunting question in 
the wake of the drama surrounding O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports has been a metaphor for American upward mobility for at least half a 
century, maybe longer. The lure of public recognition, adulation and yes, 
money, has spurred many an athletically gifted young person to excel in hopes 
of reaching the American Dream via the playing field, court or ring. 
</P>
<P>
 For better or worse, this has been especially true for African Americans, as a 
disproportionate number of our icons seem to be athletes. The reasons are 
obvious: For one thing, athletic competition, for many years, was one of the 
only places a black American could successfully challenge a white one without 
suffering dire consequences. (Even then, there was some ambivalence: When Jack 
Johnson beat Jim Jeffries in 1910, some white Americans were distinctly unhappy 
that Johnson had prevailed over the Great White Hope in the boxing ring. It 
just wasn't seemly, they argued, for a black man to stand over an inert white 
one.) For another, sports figures per se are revered in America's pantheon of 
folk heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, success through sports has worked wondrously well for us. Jesse 
Owens became an international hero through his prowess in track and field and 
was praised for his quiet dignity at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Bill Russell, 
Wes Unseld, Lenny Wilkins and John Lucas, after impressive careers as 
professional basketball players, parlayed their intelligence and drive into 
coaching, to become among the few blacks in sports management. Tennis great 
Arthur Ashe was a role model until his death and deeply respected for the same 
reason Olympian Joyner-Kersee is today: Both gave consistent service to their 
communities and were always ready to reach back and inspire young people to be 
their best. Sports gave them entree, but character allowed them to use sports 
to build constructive lives -- and to encourage others to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 So where would O. J. be without sports? By his own admission, he was an 
indifferent student and a kid whom trouble seemed to find easily and often. If 
he hadn't received a visit from one of his own heroes -- Willie Mays -- Simpson 
might not have been inspired to pull himself together to finish high school and 
attend USC, where he began his sprint into history. His agility, grace and 
comforting public geniality made him a natural for national endorsements, 
which, in turn, helped him to become universally recognized and admired. 
</P>
<P>
 But great athletes do not automatically heroes make, even when they're given 
to us by media that may have selfish reasons for exhaling them. I see the hero 
menu as a la carte, and I'll choose whom I'll have and leave whom I won't. 
</P>
<P>
 So I choose Bob Moses, a former civil-rights activist whose Math Project, now 
replicated in more than 20 U.S. cities, will liberate more inner-city kids than 
the statistically daunting enticement of a professional athletic career ever 
could. And I choose Sophia Bracy Harris, whose Federation of Child Care Centers 
of Alabama has provided a head start for some of Alabama's poorest children. 
And Arthur Mitchell, who gave up what promised to be a stellar career as a 
classical dancer to create the Dance Theatre of Harlem and thus allow millions 
of children of color to dream that they, too, could dance "The Firebird," 
"Coppelia" or "Giselle." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe what we should learn from the whole O. J. mess is this: It's time for us 
to start choosing our heroes more carefully, rather than letting others choose 
them for us. Perhaps then the next time a beloved public figure is revealed to 
be a deeply flawed human being, our shock won't be as great, and we can get on 
with life -- real life -- a lot sooner.

 Charter Medical Gets Clearance to Buy 30 Hospitals: The Federal Trade 
Commission gave Macon, Ga.-based Charter Medical Corp. permission to purchase 
30 of the 47 psychiatric hospitals it seeks to acquire from Santa Monica-based 
National Medical Enterprises Inc., the companies said. On May 13, the agency 
requested more information on the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. 
The companies said they are still responding to requests for further 
information on the 17 other sites. The request has delayed the closing of the 
$200-million transaction, which was announced March 30.

FOR SCORE AND 'GETTYSBURG'; THEATER: A COSTA MESA COMPOSER WEAVES HIS 
FASCINATION WITH HISTORY INTO A MUSICAL-IN-PROGRESS AT FULLERTON COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The battle of Gettysburg, considered the turning point of the Civil War, has 
been analyzed, discussed, written about in countless books and even turned into 
a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's unlikely this famous conflict ever inspired a musical. Until now, 
right here in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Coleman, a Costa Mesa composer and long-time Disney employee, has 
nearly completed "GETTYSBURG, the Musical." His 21-song show, which weaves real 
and fictional characters into historical accounts of the war's bloodiest fight, 
will be presented in a concert version (minus sets and costumes) at Fullerton 
College tonight and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said the musical is a work-in-progress, and he hopes the performances 
will give him a clearer idea of how to finish it. He also is using them to 
gauge whether his dream of taking the project to Broadway by late 1996 is 
realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic; I mean I believe this will go to Broadway eventually," 
Coleman said by phone from his Walt Disney Theatrical Productions office in 
Anaheim, where he's helping arrange a tour of the staged version of "Beauty and 
the Beast" in Europe and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will work because it takes risks and tells a fascinating, dramatic 
and moving story," he said, adding that several New York producers have 
expressed interest. He said he didn't approach Disney with the project, 
preferring to see whether he can mount it independently. Coleman also said 
financing might come from overseas, where he said he has contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 All well and good, but why a musical in the first place? Why not a drama or 
even another screenplay, both of which would seem to handle the event's scope 
more readily than two or three hours of tunes? 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman laughed. "I knew that question was coming . . . . Sure, this would 
make a good play, but what turned me on was seeing shows like 'Les Miserables' 
and 'Miss Saigon,' shows that aren't what we think of as typical musicals." 
</P>
<P>
 "They (take important events and) make them entertaining while not losing the 
profound stories. I've never been fascinated by the usual American musical, 
where boy meets girl, boy gets girl and boy loses girl, with all this singing 
and dancing for no apparent reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those recent, historically based musicals, Coleman said, "are more 
believable. They suspend disbelief, something I hope to do with 'Gettysburg.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the musical features seven main characters and close to 30 
supporting roles. Pivotal are Confederate leaders Gen. Robert E. Lee and Lt. 
Gen. James Longstreet and Union hero Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who 
turned back rebel forces at Little Round Top, thereby protecting the North's 
left flank and helping to ensure a Union victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the engagement on the battlefield, Coleman moves to the story of Turner 
Shaw, an educated black slave, and his best friend, Proctor Porter, the white 
son of a sharecropper. They end up on opposing sides of the struggle. Another 
subplot brings in Henry Strong, a white teacher from Maine, who becomes a 
federal soldier despite his wife's objections. 
</P>
<P>
 While he would like "GETTYSBURG, the Musical" to be more than a history 
lesson, Coleman said he's tried to be true to the facts, most of which are 
still stunning. Gettysburg resulted in at least 51,000 casualties, more than 
one-third of all the Confederate and Union soldiers who fought during those 
three days in early July, 1863. Lee's army never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This battle has fascinated me for years because it was so important to our 
destiny in saving the Union," Coleman said. "I've researched it for years, 
reading two dozen history books on the Civil War. I wracked my brain over how 
to do it justice, and I finally came up with this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, "GETTYSBURG, the Musical" runs nearly three hours. Coleman has written 
it without dialogue or narrative; the songs alone tell the tale. Some 
compositions have been omitted from the Fullerton College performances, which 
should last about 1 hour and 45 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast is made up of students, all from the college's performing arts 
departments. Coleman, who co-directed the touring show of "The King and I" with 
Yul Brynner and co-wrote the theme song, "Rock the Pond," for the Mighty Ducks 
hockey team, chose Fullerton to introduce his project because he is friends 
with Brent Pierce, a music department instructor at the college. Pierce is the 
producer and vocal arranger for the two performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Brent and I thought it would be great to have an opportunity to hear my 
music and have his students work on a show in the making," he explained. 
Coleman conceded that the campus presentation is also practical -- he'll see an 
audience's reaction without the cost of renting a hall and paying singers' 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, this is helping me, but I think it will help the students too," he 
said. "And who knows, some of them may end up in the Broadway cast." 
</P>
<P>
 * "GETTYSBURG, the Musical" will be performed tonight and Thursday in 
Fullerton College's Recital Hall, 321 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. 7:30. $6. 
(714) 871-8101.

FILM RATINGS BOARD PICKS MOSK AS ITS NEW LEADER; MOVIES: AFTER 20 YEARS, 
RICHARD HEFFNER IS STEPPING DOWN AS HEAD OF A PANEL THAT REMAINS A HOTBED OF 
CONTROVERSY. RICHARD MOSK TAKES OVER JULY 1. 
</P>

<P>
 Two decades after his appointment as chairman of the Classification & Rating 
Administration, the film industry's controversial ratings arm, Richard Heffner 
is relinquishing the hot seat. His successor, Richard Mosk, will assume the 
post July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing lasts forever," explains Jack Valenti, president of the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America which, with the National Assn. of Theater Owners, 
oversees the ratings board. "After 20 years, we're bringing someone else in to 
keep the institution alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosk, 54, an honors graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law School, is 
a partner with the Los Angeles firm of Sanders, Barnet, Goldman, Simons and 
Mosk, specializing in litigation arbitration law. He was a staff member of the 
Warren Commission investigating the assassination of President Kennedy; one of 
three American judges on the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal that arose out of the 
hostage situation; and a member of the Christopher Commission investigating the 
Los Angeles police in the wake of the Rodney G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, he'll have his hands full. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings of movies are routinely second-guessed by filmmakers who've called the 
standards ambiguous and arbitrary. Debate continues over the 4-year-old 
"adults-only" NC-17 rating that has proven to be nearly as stigmatizing as the 
"X" it replaced. And the committee -- nearly a dozen parents whose job it is to 
provide guidelines about a movie's suitability for children -- is caught in a 
cross fire between artists who view its very existence as institutionalized 
censorship and local school boards or right-wing religious groups eager to take 
matters into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is a political football in the industry, as well. "The system works 
-- for the major studios, at least," observes Mitch Goldman, president of 
marketing and distribution at New Line Cinema. "But there's a definite double 
standard when it comes to rating the independents. Because we're not Paramount 
or Universal, we had a tough time with ("Nightmare on Elm Street's") Freddy 
Krueger. He's a very popular horror character who became Heffner's main 
nemesis." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, retorts the departing chief. "Our badge of honor is that the big 
guys -- as well as the little ones -- are unhappy with us," Heffner says. 
"Despite this industry's cult of personality, we don't rate producers or 
directors or studios but movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Some argue that the 25-year-old group is, in some ways, as outmoded as the 
Motion Picture Code that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with the ratings board is that they're set up to deal with one 
culture -- and we're in a multi-cultural society," observes Samuel Goldwyn Jr., 
chairman of the Samuel Goldwyn Co. "Words and language offensive to people in 
Greenwich, Conn., may have no meaning in a black environment. There's a fear of 
language and a preference for violence -- which is actually a far greater 
threat. You can cut heads off, sever hands . . . but don't let them use the 
'f-word' twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldwyn knows whereof he speaks. His company picked up Martin Lawrence's "You 
So Crazy" from Miramax after the movie was awarded an NC-17. Releasing the 
movie with an adults-only designation may have embarrassed the family-oriented 
Disney, which purchased Miramax last June. But releasing it without a rating -- 
as the independent Goldwyn ultimately did -- is a luxury not afforded the major 
studios by the MPAA. 
</P>
<P>
 "You So Crazy" -- despite the NC-17 flap -- performed well at the box office, 
taking in between $12 million and $13 million domestically. Though major movie 
chains such as AMC and Cineplex Odeon agreed to play the picture, that's 
frequently not the case. Mall owners occasionally prohibit theaters from 
showing NC-17 films. Some newspapers and networks will not accept NC-17 
advertising. And several video outfits, including Blockbuster, the largest, 
keep NC-17 movies off their shelves -- a policy that led Universal Pictures to 
release two versions of "The Getaway": an R-rated theatrical version for 
Blockbuster as well as a steamier unrated one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board is way behind the times -- not to mention the rest of the world -- 
when it comes to sex," maintains director Phillip Noyce, who cut three minutes 
from "Sliver" to get the desired R rating. "And it has very strange directives. 
I was told we couldn't show Sharon Stone moving when she was astride Billy 
Baldwin -- as though moving . . . enjoying the act . . . made it more 
objectionable. The focus seemed to be more on the publicity surrounding the 
film and Stone's notoriety than on what was there on the screen. It's 
unfortunate that an organization set up to avoid government censorship is so 
afraid of controversy that it bends over backward in regulating itself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The R-rated "Sliver" grossed $37 million domestically, while the uncut version 
took in more than twice that overseas. That, according to Heffner, is at the 
heart of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the criticism of the ratings system comes from the fact that we are 
perceived to be taking money out of the pockets of people," he asserts. "The 
lucrative contracts these directors sign requiring them to deliver an 'R' make 
for an incredible amount of hypocrisy. They want to maintain their 'vision'? 
Fine. Just release the movie with an NC-17." 
</P>
<P>
 His successor concurs: "We're not censoring or making artistic judgments about 
a given movie -- just providing information to help parents decide if their 
children should see it," says Mosk. "The process is not a science. It's 
inherently subjective. But 74% of those polled last October said they found the 
ratings 'very' or 'fairly' useful. The issue of what's appropriate in art and 
literature has been with us forever. People criticized the nudes on 
Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling -- and that was a deeply religious 
project commissioned by the Pope." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenti points out that all but two of the countries in the world -- Germany 
and Japan -- have government censorship that ranges from "stern to 
substantial." Voluntarism, he's convinced, is a plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying that we haven't made mistakes in rating the 11,773 movies 
we've looked at over the years," he admits. "But the question -- as in all of 
life -- is 'If not this . . . what?' "

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: TRUTHMAN SLIPS UP IN HIS RUSH TO JUDGMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm not making this up, folks." -- Rush Limbaugh 
</P>
<P>
 Bawling with Bubba, and the Adventures of Truthman. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation was naturally wading in tears -- tears of laughter -- after 
President Clinton's "poor-me" protest that he has no way of countering 
relentless pounding by influential TV and radio commentator Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton issued his sad-sack lament Friday at a gathering of radio talk-show 
hosts in St. Louis. In doing so, he conveniently ignored his own network of 
public opinion spinners and the other communications levers he controls, 
including the capacity, as President, to command the media's attention any time 
he wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's no truth detector," Clinton pouted about Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the President, his act was soon eclipsed by an even bigger 
farce. The source was Mr. Dittohead himself, for more comical even than Clinton 
was Limbaugh's own thunderous reply to the presidential hooey in St. Louie: 
"There is no need for a truth detector. I am the truth detector." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, yes. Now into the straitjacket, Rushie. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Limbaugh wore his Truthman disguise throughout his three-hour 
call-in radio show (on KFI), vowing to continue his "relentless pursuit" of 
fact, not illusion. How relentless? This relentless. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the Simpson-Goldman murder case, Limbaugh reported that both F. 
Lee Bailey and Alan M. Dershowitz, members of O.J. Simpson's defense team, said 
that "there will be no insanity plea." Actually, only Bailey said that. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying at one point in his show that "nothing we've heard about (the 
Simpson-Goldman case) is the truth," Limbaugh later contradicted himself, 
chiding O.J. Simpson supporters for ignoring "the appearance of evidence" 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 To support his standard line about the media being in Clinton's hip pocket, 
meanwhile, Limbaugh recalled a 1993 after-dinner speech in which the President 
made Limbaugh the punch line of an ugly joke. Noting that Limbaugh had defended 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno against harsh criticism from Rep. John Conyers Jr. 
(D-Mich.), who is black, Clinton had quipped that Limbaugh had come to Reno's 
defense only "because she was attacked by a black guy." A nasty dig. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh charged Monday that the incident had "never been reported" by the 
media. On the contrary, it was reported by at least one newspaper, the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Truthman merely having a rare bad day at the office? 
</P>
<P>
 Not according to Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting. The Washington-based media 
watchdog today is releasing a list of a few dozen Limbaugh "whoppers" that it 
says it compiled from several weeks of his TV show, his radio show, his two 
best-selling books and other "published evaluations." 
</P>
<P>
 The list is significant because, as Clinton's public protests affirmed, 
Limbaugh is significant. More than just another entertainer aiming topical 
shtick at his millions of partisans (nicknamed dittoheads), he is taken 
seriously as a right-wing Republican VIP; witness his guest shots on such 
mainline news programs as NBC's "Meet the Press" and ABC's "Nightline." As 
such, with books, videos, audiotapes and ideas to sell, he has become his own 
sprawling cottage industry, a highly effective self-promoter whose half-truths, 
semi-truths and untruths seep into the public consciousness and thicken there 
like waxy yellow buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 Because its political perspective is far leftward of Limbaugh's conservatism, 
FAIR is no neutral observer. Yet its report on Limbaugh's "chronic inaccuracy" 
speaks largely for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 According to FAIR, here are samples of Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Rodney G. King jurors: "The videotape of the Rodney King beating played 
absolutely no role in the conviction of two of the four officers. It was pure 
emotion that was responsible for the guilty verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 As FAIR notes, though, the foreman of the jury in the King federal civil 
rights trial told the Los Angeles Times that the videotape was "crucial" in the 
panel's conviction of Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officer Laurence M. Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 * On contractor C.C. Myers completing repairs 74 days early on the 
earthquake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway: "The governor of California declared 
the (freeway) a disaster area and by so doing eliminated the need for 
competitive bids. . . . Government got the hell out of the way." A few days 
later, Limbaugh added about Myers, "They gave this guy the job without having 
to go through the rigmarole of giving 25% of the job to a minority-owned 
business and 25% to a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, wrong. As FAIR notes and the Los Angeles Times reported, there was 
competitive bidding, with Myers winning over four other contractors. Also, as 
The Times said, the project's goal was to draw 40% of subcontractors from 
minority- or woman-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * On females: "Women were doing quite well in this country before feminism 
came along." This depends on how you define "quite well." As FAIR notes, prior 
to "feminism," U.S. women did not have the right to vote.

 * On Anita Hill: "(She) followed Clarence Thomas everywhere. Wherever he went, 
she wanted to be right by his side. She wanted to work with him, she wanted to 
continue to date him. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR: "Hill could not have continued to date Thomas, since they never dated." 
</P>
<P>
 * On the Persian Gulf War: "Everybody in the world was aligned with the United 
States except who? The United States Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR: "Both houses of Congress voted to authorize the U.S. to use force 
against Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
 * On Bosnia: "For the first time in military history, the U.S. military 
personnel are not under the command of United States generals." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong again, says FAIR. Quoting a Pentagon spokesman, it lists several foreign 
commanders of U.S. troops, including France's Marshall Foch in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 * On President James Madison: Limbaugh quoted him as saying, "We have staked 
the future . . . upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, 
to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR quotes an associate editor of "The Madison Papers" as saying this is 
"entirely inconsistent with everything we know about Madison's views on 
religion and government." 
</P>
<P>
 * On Native Americans: "There are more American Indians alive today than there 
were when Columbus arrived or at any other time in history. Does this sound 
like a record of genocide?" 
</P>
<P>
 No. But FAIR cites a U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs official's estimate of a 
pre-Columbus Native American population of between 5 million and 15 million in 
what is now the United States, compared with about 2 million today. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving him his due, Truthman appears to be factually right at least as often 
as he's wrong. Hitting 50% or 60% of your shots makes you a star in basketball. 
However, that's unacceptable for a self-defined oracle whose trustworthiness is 
taken for granted by a hefty number of Americans.

THEATER REVIEWS; WHEN IT'S TAKEN TOO SERIOUSLY, IT'S ONLY A PLAY; EACH ACTOR AT

<P>
 "It's Only a Play" is Terrence McNally's "Give My Regards to Broadway," a 
lightweight tribute to the theater as seen from the lofty but limited vantage 
point of Broadway artists who are consumed by New York's hit/flop mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes place on the opening night of a Broadway play and delights at poking 
fun at everyone: star, director, playwright and producer, each anxiously 
awaiting the all-important reviews, dishing one another nervously while they 
wonder if they will be the toast or laughingstock of this uptight town. And of 
course, there's the all-important critic, without whom there'd be nothing for 
everyone else to get nervous about. 
</P>
<P>
 McNally, who has had his share of flops as well as hits in a long and 
distinguished career, knows the territory well and has fun with the script. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the fun doesn't come across as infectiously as it should at the 
North Coast Repertory Theatre. The cast and design team are talented, but the 
show, under the direction of Christina Courtenay, takes itself far too 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 It slogs around in sentimentality when it should fly on hilarity. Earnestness 
has its place, but with characters this pretentious, it's best to keep it brief 
and get on with the liveliness of McNally's satire. 
</P>
<P>
 The action takes place in the upstairs bedroom of first-time Broadway producer 
Julia Budder (Diane Addis), who is hosting a party for the opening night of her 
new show. 
</P>
<P>
 The party-within-a-party that finds itself in the bedroom includes the 
playwright, Peter Austin (Luther Hanson), suicidally anxious about his big 
Broadway break; Peter's best friend, James Wicker (Michael Pieper), who turned 
down the lead and wants to see it flop so he'll know he made the right choice; 
star actress Virginia Noyes (Sandra Ellis-Troy), hoping for a comeback; 
director Frank Finger (Christine Nicholson), the critics' darling who knows in 
her heart she's a fake, and the much-hated critic, Ira Drew (Bob Larsen), who 
for once would like to be on the inside instead of the outside looking in. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor by actor, the cast is a good one. But the parts never meld into a whole. 
Addis, a newcomer to the North Coast stage, brings a sweet naivete to the part 
of the producer who never quite seems to get what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Hume, another newcomer, brings fresh wide-eyed charm to his role as an 
aspiring actor. Ellis-Troy, resplendent in a glittering gown by John-Bryan 
Davis, lends depth to McNally's caricature of the shallow star who makes 
dramatic speeches about "The Theater" in between lines of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Burnett's set design is sumptuously elegant and nicely lit by Lisa M. 
Lane, although the living room itself could have been better personalized to 
Budder.  
</P>
<P>
 Davis' costumes are, as always, on the mark, capturing the glamour and the 
grit as needed -- as when a cabby, Emma (Dawne Ellison), comes up to join the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Jim Johnston's sound, one wishes there were more of it to more fully 
convey the raucousness of the main party from which the characters in the 
upstairs bedroom are escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem in this production is the subtle but all-important one of 
tone. The actors play these parts as if they are getting in touch with all the 
times they have been burned in their theatrical careers. They seem to forget 
that they are playing the privileged in "It's Only a Play." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, their characters complain, but they complain as stars in the big leagues 
do -- crying crocodile tears that dry in a flash as they spy their next 
conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 The funniest parts of "It's Only a Play" center on McNally's attacks of 
critics, the highlight being a scathing review as supposedly written by Frank 
Rich, then the chief and much feared drama critic of the New York Times (who 
actually gave a good review to the Manhattan Theatre Club production of this 
work). 
</P>
<P>
 It's the panned playwright's ultimate revenge -- and it's a delicious one. 
McNally's point, as expressed in the very title of this play, seems to be, why 
the viciousness of the critics? After all, it's only a play.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course to this, the critic may well respond, "Hey, it's only a review!"

THEATER REVIEWS; 'GLENGARRY': REALTY CHECK IN THE LAND OF PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Mamet's "Glengarry Glen Ross" won a well-deserved Pulitzer Prize in 1984 
as an enlightening glimpse at the American way of life. Of course, his writing 
style had something to do with the stunning reality of the play, and its 
honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a style that adheres to the rhythms and vocal shorthand of the American 
males Mamet most cherishes as a writer, and his ear is impeccable. In a 
production at the Ensemble Theatre, director Roosevelt Blankenship Jr. and his 
cast have captured the flavor inherent in Mamet's dialogue, and the cadence, 
and the guttural honesty of these high priests of phony hype. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little plot to "Glengarry." There's a lot of character, though, and 
it's not an easy play to stage. Its colors are primary, its rhythms insistent, 
and its effect depends on driving tempos and actors able to look beyond their 
stereotypes to the honest guts beneath what's written. 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenship has guided his actors judiciously and with a great deal of respect 
for Mamet's text. The world the playwright is examining -- that of real-estate 
salesmen who peddle questionable property to all those suckers out there who 
are waiting to be taken -- is reproduced in this production with a clarity that 
should warn anyone to triple-check the next business deal that winks at them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a role usually given a harsher underside, Steve Howard is more than 
impressive as super-slick Ricky Romano, who is at the top of the sales board 
and going up. Howard's Romano is cool, deliberate and with just a hint of 
insincere warmth that might fool his customers, and gives the performance a 
rewarding depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Liebgot is also notable as Shelly Levene, a role usually played by an 
older actor. Liebgot's sense of emotional weight provides the feeling of the 
years Levene has been around, once on top, now forced to foolish action to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Scholl, James M. Green and Victor Mena all turn in biting, forceful 
portraits of other salesmen in the office, and Kevin Darne, as the cop who 
tries fitfully to investigate an office robbery, has the right brusque 
officiousness. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is very funny, marshaling all his patience while Romano is trying 
desperately to save a bad sale to Norman Cleary's born sucker of a customer. 
Cleary's perfect, terrified naivete, Romano's slimy maneuvering, and Darne's 
deadpan hatred of Romano create one of those theatrical moments that sticks 
long in memory.

NETWORKS IN A BIDDING WAR FOR CNN CORRESPONDENT AMANPOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christiane Amanpour, the award-winning war correspondent for CNN, is being 
wooed by executives at NBC, CBS and ABC to leave CNN and join one of the 
broadcast networks' news divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanpour, whose contract with CNN expires Thursday, recently won the Polk, 
Peabody and duPont awards for her reporting from Bosnia-Herzegovina.She is one 
of the few news stars on CNN and the cable news operation is bidding to 
maintain her services. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at all three broadcast networks are reportedly offering the 
36-year-old Amanpour jobs as a foreign correspondent on their nightly evening 
newscasts, along with a much larger paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC News president Andrew Lack has been particularly active in personally 
pursuing Amanpour for NBC. In addition to a spot on "NBC Nightly News," the 
network is offering Amanpour time on SuperChannel, the European superstation 
(recently purchased by NBC) that is running NBC News programs and is expected 
to expand its news programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanpour, on assignment for CNN in Rwanda, began her career as a desk 
assistant for CNN in 1983 before becoming a war correspondent, first in the 
Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 News executives say Amanpour is unusual among TV reporters in her devotion to 
the story she is covering -- and her relative lack of interest in being a 
network anchor or a newsmagazine feature reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN, sources said, is offering Amanpour a substantial pay increase, but it is 
unclear whether the network is willing to approach the size of the broadcast 
offers. Amanpour is expected to continue working for CNN in Rwanda past the 
contract deadline as the negotiations are resolved during the next several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in active discussions with Christiane," CNN spokesman Steve 
Haworth said Tuesday. "We think the world of her as a journalist and a person, 
and we hope she'll stay at CNN."

MUSIC; JAZZMAN HAS STAYED CLOSE TO HIS CLASSICAL ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pianist Milcho Leviev is best known for his jazz playing, but he has never 
sloughed off the classical conservatory training he received as a youth in his 
native Bulgaria. So his recital Thursday for the Seal Beach Chamber Music 
Festival is not quite the anomaly it may seem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't actually deserted the classical field at all," Leviev, 56, said in 
a recent phone interview from his home in North Hollywood. "I've been obscure, 
so to speak, but I've been always practicing. As a matter of fact, people give 
me funny looks when I start playing Chopin etudes before a jazz gig for a 
warm-up: 'He's trying to impress by playing classical music,' they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the point. I have had classical training (and) experience. I've 
conducted orchestras way back in Bulgaria. But it's also true I haven't given a 
(classical) recital since I came to this country, which was in 1971." 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's recital, Leviev will play the music of Bach, Haydn, Chopin, 
Ravel, Bulgarian composer Pancho Vladigerov and some of his own pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Leviev fell in love with jazz as an 18-year-old and began playing in small 
groups in Sofia, the capital city of Bulgaria. But the freedom inherent in jazz 
and the repression inherent in the Communist political system didn't coexist 
easily. There was a relatively more open period in the '60s until the uprising 
in the Czech capital of Prague in 1968, which brought the lid back down -- 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Leviev defected when he had a chance, coming in 1971 to Los Angeles to play in 
the Don Ellis Orchestra, with which he remained for eight years. He also played 
with such musicians and groups as Billy Cobham, Free Flight and Art Pepper and 
recorded with Manhattan Transfer and Al Jarreau, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to dig into the real (jazz) more," he said. "Classical I had already 
studied, worked on and continued to work on. What I needed was to explore jazz 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playing jazz and playing classical music are "very different experiences," he 
said. "Yet there is a similarity because you improvise in the classics, too. 
Not by changing the texts, but you change the moods. Certain passages by Bach, 
or anybody, could be played at any possible dynamic, tempo and any possible 
deviation from the tempo. That's the same as jazz, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing (with jazz) is, you have to come up with the notes, the 
musical text. Here, the most important thing is behind the text . . . the mood. 
You try to generate the mood, even to send a message, even a rational message. 
That could be improvised as well." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "in classical music what sometimes turns me off is the mentality, 
this unbelievable reverence to the composer, in terms of what is on the paper," 
he said. "What's on the paper is insufficient. It's a typographical map." 
</P>
<P>
 So with Bach, he feels free to add octaves or to double chords because Bach 
was writing for an instrument -- a harpsichord -- that was more limited in 
range than a modern grand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'Well-Tempered Clavier' is for keyboard, which means 'any keyboard,' " he 
said. "We know Bach had a glimpse of the contemporary piano (of his day), which 
was even not close to a contemporary piano today. . . . He tried it, but he 
found the range too limited. . . . So if you try to add an octave or double a 
chord or play the ornaments in your own way, not necessarily the canonic way, 
it's OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "I improvise at the time I play. But if you want to improvise in depth, you 
have to explore different ways of improvisation. That means you have to 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave Brubeck, I think, said: 'The best improvisation is the well-rehearsed 
improvisation.' That makes sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Leviev will play half the Thursday recital by memory and half from reading the 
scores, "especially my pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Why?  
</P>
<P>
 "My pieces are hard to play," Leviev said. "I've written a suite called 'A 
Little Old-Time Music,' but these pieces were originally written for orchestra. 
I made a piano transcription that is very tricky. I guess I could memorize it, 
but there are parts that are not in the piano transcription." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also will play music by Vladigerov, who lived from 1899 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my composition teacher," Leviev said. "He's a pretty famous composer 
in Europe. He never came to the United States, but he worked in Germany. He was 
the composer of the Max Reinhardt theater (in Berlin). For 10 years, he was the 
staff composer there." 
</P>
<P>
 Vladigerov is considered Bulgaria's major composer, Leviev said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bulgaria, until the mid-19th Century, virtually didn't have classical music. 
It was under the Ottoman jurisdiction for 500 years. So classical development 
started in the mid-1800s. Composers before him were kind of primitives, so to 
speak, in a good sense. Some of them were very talented people, but they didn't 
read music like this gentleman did." 
</P>
<P>
 * Pianist Milcho Leviev will play works by Bach, Haydn, Chopin, Ravel and 
other composers on Thursday in the McGaugh School Auditorium, 1698 Bolsa Ave., 
Seal Beach. 8 p.m. The free recital is part of the 20th annual Seal Beach

TV RATINGS; SIMPSON CASE HELPS MAGAZINES SINK A RATINGS BASKET

 Game 7 of the NBA Finals drew a large audience, but it was the network 
newsmagazines that came out the big winners last week, courtesy of the case 
surrounding the murders of football legend O.J. Simpson's ex-wife and a friend, 
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. results released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "Turning Point," anchored by Barbara Walters, focused on the celebrated 
case and was the No. 1-rated program, the first time since it premiered a few 
months ago.Audiences hungry for Simpson-related development and analysis also 
tuned in ABC's "20/20" (No. 5), "Primetime Live" (No. 8) and NBC's "Dateline 
NBC" (No. 12). 
</P>
<P>
 Even a repeat of a study of domestic violence on CBS' "48 Hours" (No. 14) drew 
a sizable audience with its new introduction loosely linking the show to the 
Simpson murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, CBS' "Greyhounds," an unsold pilot starring Dennis Weaver, Robert 
Guillaume and Pat Morita as retirees fighting crime, scored respectable numbers 
in its outing last Friday night (No. 23), but it remained uncertain whether 
there was enough interest to eventually warrant a permanent spot on the 
network's prime-time schedule. Southland Ratings Here are A.C. Nielsen's Top 10 
prime-time programs in the Los Angeles area during the same week. Each rating 
point equals 50,064 households. 03,28,06,06 Sta- Rat- Program tion ing

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; WARNING ABOUT THE LIMOUSINE LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man who was general manager of the Santa Margarita Water District for more 
than 17 years is now an admitted lawbreaker, having pleaded guilty to criminal 
conflict-of-interest charges. Big spender Walter W. (Bill) Knitz once hired a 
limousine to take himself around New York's Central Park for $245 and charged 
the cost to the district; now he will spend more than a week picking up trash 
along the roadside or performing some other public service. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz also must pay $20,000 in restitution to the water district. Finally, and 
importantly, under the terms of the plea bargain undertaken in court Monday, 
Knitz is barred from working for a water district for three years and from 
lobbying any state, local or county agency for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics who would have preferred jail time emphasized the "bargain" part 
of the plea bargain. Probably a stiffer fine or more community service could 
have been justified. Still, the sentence should send a message that crimes do 
bring punishment. The prosecutor noted that Knitz was not an elected official 
who embezzled public funds but rather had charged off unallowable expenditures 
to a quasi-public agency. He also violated state law by voting on matters 
affecting companies from which he had taken money; that was wrong, but less 
serious than betraying the public trust through theft of tax money. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz is 62, and the sentence clearly will deprive him of his normal manner of 
earning a living for a substantial period. Before Knitz's plea, worked out with 
the Orange County district attorney's office, two other district employees 
settled civil lawsuits alleging conflicts of interest and paid fines of $10,000 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentences are important, to punish wrongdoers and deter others. But 
perhaps more important for the long run are the actions the district has taken 
for badly needed systemic reform. Knitz and his former assistant have left 
office. All the board members have been replaced. The method of electing new 
members has been changed. 
</P>
<P>
 One turn of events before the plea bargain was that California-American Water 
Co., a private firm that wants to buy the water district, hired Knitz as a 
consultant after he had left Santa Margarita and was awaiting disposition of 
criminal charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Knitz is barred from such employment now, at the time there was nothing 
illegal about the job; California-American said it hired him just for one task, 
to help explain the district's operations and finances. But in associating 
itself with Knitz, the company may have added an unintended additional barrier 
to showing that water district customers really will be better off down the 
road with new, private ownership than with continuing as a public agency.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: DEPENDING ON IMMIGRANTS -- AND SELF-DECEPTION; LABOR: 
REMIND THOSE WHO WOULD BAN THEM AT THE BORDER THAT THEY DO JOBS OTHERS WON'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PRISCILLA MAYFIELD, Priscilla Mayfield is a writer living in Orange.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a recent, exceedingly fine day I found myself gazing out the window at the 
hillside behind my house, once green and lush with nopal cactus and green 
tumbleweed balls, then denuded and carefully replanted with "native" shrubbery, 
including "wild" fennel and papery purple and white statice.  
</P>
<P>
 Part of my purview on this day included a team of men methodically weeding 
among the cultivated plantings. I thought to myself that there were worse 
things a body could be doing on such a fine day than working on a hillside in 
the sun. When the lunch truck rumbled up the street and parked, sending the 
intoxicating scent of carnitas wafting through the air, some of the men broke 
into song as they trudged down the hill to lunch. I wished I spoke Spanish, so 
that I could have understood the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun and the song and the fresh smells combined to drape the scene with a 
diaphanous, rosy romanticism, a rich golden haze that made it seem like 
something only pure and good. 
</P>
<P>
 And what is bad about men working the beautiful Orange County outdoors, and 
the opportunity to take a break from the vertebrae-straining bending the job 
entails to enjoy freshly fried carnitas? I thought of strawberries, which 
enjoyed an unprecedented early debut this year, and the folks who pick them, 
making it possible for you and me to do no more than visit our local market to 
pay a pittance for what is surely one of God's lagniappes for man. I think of 
the "nannies" I see at the playground where I take my little son, caring for 
others' Most Precious Possessions for the princely sum of $400 per month, 
including, I have been reminded, room and board. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly what I think of is this: Just what do all the nattering 
anti-immigration blowhards think we would do if these hard-working people were 
not streaming into our region and taking these jobs? Would the legions of bored 
teen-agers in the mall-supplied gangsta garb stampede into low-paying landscape 
maintenance jobs? I think not. Do most people know that field workers only 
recently got the right to have sanitary facilities and fresh drinking water, 
and then only when these minimal human needs were mandated by a court? And to 
me, room and board included sounds a lot like 24-hour on-call servitude at 
near-slave wages. 
</P>
<P>
 These immigrant workers, legal or not, live in and with conditions that are so 
primitive that they lie beyond the ken of most of us, even while we demand from 
them cultivated greenbelts and daily-fresh strawberries and child care, all at 
bargain-basement prices. 
</P>
<P>
 I like to imagine that just for a day or two, all our immigrant labor, legal 
or no, could be somehow spirited from the environs. Then, I tell myself, all 
those presently blinded will see! It's an evil, tangled web we have woven, the 
popular denunciation of those on whom we are absolutely dependent.

LEFTWICH NOT THE ANSWER AS WITT THROTTLES ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time Bobby Witt took the mound, he came a half-step short of becoming 
one of baseball's dazzling dozen, losing what might have been the 12th perfect 
game in major league history in the sixth inning when Kansas City's Greg Gagne 
bunted and was called safe at first even though Witt apparently beat him to the 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no drama, no controversy Tuesday night at the Oakland Coliseum, just 
another sparkling performance by Witt, a 3-0 victory by the streaking A's and 
another loss by the Angels. Witt held the Angels to a pair of Tim Salmon 
singles en route to a complete-game victory before 14,525. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, the 30-year-old right-hander struck out 14 Royals and faced 
only 28 batters during the first one-hitter of his career. Against the Angels, 
he struck out only five and walked two, but for a guy whose earned-run average 
was 6.89 three weeks ago, even a victory over the Angels is reason to 
celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I was as focused as the other night," Witt said. "To be 
honest, I was a little jittery. They've got some hitters who can hurt you if 
you make a mistake and that team has always been tough on me." 
</P>
<P>
 The A's have won 14 of the last 18 games. The Angels have lost four of the 
last six. And Witt has two more wins in the last week than all the Angel 
starting pitchers combined. Witt has allowed just 24 hits in the last 37 2/3 
innings while striking out 32 and walking just nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes something happens where you get in a groove and you just feel 
confident every time you go out there," Witt said. "I don't really know how you 
describe it." 
</P>
<P>
 If he can find the right words, the Angels will listen. They were hoping the 
return of Phil Leftwich would bolster their starting rotation. Making his first 
start since he was placed on the disabled list June 9 because of swelling in 
his right lower leg, Leftwich lasted six innings, giving up seven hits and just 
two earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it wasn't a bad outing. But on this night, it certainly wasn't enough 
to keep pace with Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 14-strikeout game, he had his 'A' stuff on all three pitches from the 
first pitch to the last pitch," Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said. "Tonight, 
he was good in the first inning and then slipped a little in the second. After 
that, he just got stronger and stronger."  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels got the first two runners on in the second inning when Salmon 
singled and Chad Curtis walked. Designated hitter Rex Hudler sacrificed, but 
J.T. Snow struck out. Witt walked Greg Myers intentionally to load the bases 
and then got Gary DiSarcina to ground out to second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Witt was good, very good," Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "He made the 
pitches he had to make. And he got himself out of that one key inning. Even in 
a two-hit shutout, there's usually one key inning that you have to work 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich's problems began with a one-out walk to Brent Gates in the fifth. 
Shortstop Mike Bordick lined a triple, his second extra-base hit of the night, 
into the left-field corner and Scott Brosius' line-drive single to left gave 
the A's a 2-0 lead. Leftwich struck out Scott Hemond, but Rickey Henderson 
singled and Leftwich escaped the inning only when second baseman Damion Easley 
made a diving catch of a line drive by Stan Javier. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland took a 3-0 lead in the sixth when Geronimo Berroa led off with a 
single to left and scored one out later on when Troy Neel singled and Salmon's 
throw to third skipped past Spike Owen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we're playing better," La Russa said. "It's more exciting and more 
fun, but I don't think we start saying we're something special. We've got a 
long way to go to be respectable and that's getting to .500."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; HE HITS NOTHING BUT NYET; GROUP B: SALENKO 
SETS RECORD WITH FIVE GOALS IN 6-1 ROUT OF CAMEROON, KEEPING RUSSIANS ALIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cameroon, which four years ago became the first African team to earn a berth 
in the World Cup quarterfinals, learned Tuesday what it is like to be on 
history's dark side. 
</P>
<P>
 Lion kings no more, they not only lost to Russia, 6-1, but made sure that no 
one will ever forget it by allowing forward Oleg Salenko to score five goals, 
the most by one player in a World Cup game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we can't have God on our side all the time," Cameroon forward 
Francois Omam-Biyick said after his team finished fourth in Group B with an 
0-2-1 record and failed to advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians had also felt forsaken after losing their first two games, 
scoring one goal and giving up five. But that changed before a Stanford Stadium 
crowd of 74,914 as their overwhelming victory gave them hope of moving on in 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Russia does not play again, Salenko, 24, has left his mark on the 
World Cup. His three first half and two second-half goals against Cameroon give 
him six in three games -- the same number that Italy's Toto Schillaci had in 
seven games when he led the 1990 World Cup in scoring and more than all but 
five teams in this year's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Who says Americans will never adopt soccer because it has too few statistics 
to form rotisserie leagues? Of course, if there had been rotisserie leagues for 
this World Cup, it is possible that no one would have selected Salenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Salenko earned notoriety at home as a teen-ager, becoming the first player in 
the new era of professionalism to move from one team in the former Soviet Union 
to another for an official transfer fee. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dynamo Kiev lured him away from Leningrad Zenit with an apartment, a car 
and a salary that included payments in dollars as well as rubles, Zenit sued 
and was awarded 50,000 rubles, which, before the Russian currency was devalued, 
was equal to $50,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, not especially productive ones for Salenko, Dynamo Kiev sold 
him in 1992 to a Spanish team, Longrones, for $2 million. Welcome to 
capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the luxury of a scouting budget, the Russian coaches lost track of 
him. It was only after they asked a national sports newspaper, Sport Express, 
to report on how Russian players were faring in foreign leagues that they 
learned Salenko had regained his scoring touch. He had 16 goals last season for 
Longrones and has since transferred to Valencia, a more prestigious Spanish 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Salenko did not start in Russia's opening 2-0 loss here to Brazil, and 
although he scored the team's lone goal in a 3-1 loss to Sweden last Friday at 
Pontiac, Mich., no one could have foreseen the game he had Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You only have one day in your life like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That no doubt is the hope of Cameroon goalkeeper Jacques Songo, playing his 
first World Cup game after the regular starter, Joseph-Antoine Bell, decided 
that his presence on the field was too divisive.  
</P>
<P>
 An outspoken critic of Cameroon's soccer federation in a never-ending dispute 
between players and officials over money, Bell did not enjoy his view from the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six goals is good for soccer, but it is bad for goalies," he said. "It was 
not a pleasant thing to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Believing that they were playing for nothing but respect, Russia's beleaguered 
coach, Pavel Sadyrin, said his team was motivated by media forecasts that 
Cameroon would score "three, four, five times against us." 
</P>
<P>
 With his team attacking from the outset, Salenko scored his first goal in the 
16th minute, his second in the 41st and his third -- on a penalty kick -- in 
the 45th. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for inspiration, Cameroon Coach Henri Michel sent the oldest Lion, 
42-year-old forward Roger Milla, into the game to start the second half, and 
only two minutes later he delivered a goal. He already was the oldest man to 
score in the World Cup with four goals in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Lions pushing forward desperately in an attempt to edge closer, 
their already suspect defense was stretched too thin. Salenko scored in the 
73rd minute and again in the 75th, then assisted on forward Dmitri Radchenko's 
goal in the 82nd. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was his star hour," Russian captain Viktor Onopko said of Salenko.

MEXICO KEEPS ITS NERVE, GIVES ITALY CASE OF JITTERS; GROUP E: A 1-1 TIE PUTS 
MEXICO IN FIRST PLACE. ITALY ISN'T ASSURED OF ADVANCEMENT UNTIL LATER IN THE 
DAY. 
</P>

<P>
 To understand how Mexico frustrated Italy Tuesday in a World Cup game that 
doubled the size of Mexican dreams, one needed only to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second half, Mexican fans, who chant, "Ole!" each time 
their team controls the ball with a short pass, turned creaky RFK Stadium into 
a bullring. 
</P>
<P>
 From Luis Garcia, to Joaquin del Olmo, to Jorge Rodriguez, to . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole!  
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans eventually lost that possession but never their nerve, battling 
the Italians to a 1-1 tie, which gave Mexico the Group E title on goals scored. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Mexico heads for a second-round battle in East Rutherford, N.J., next 
Tuesday against the second-place finisher in Group D -- probably Nigeria -- but 
the once-proud Italians face a much more difficult road. 
</P>
<P>
 By finishing third in Group E behind Mexico and Ireland, because of their loss 
to the Irish, the Italians must play a first-place team in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 "We need you to pray," Italy's Coach Arrigo Sacchi said to his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Campos, the Mexican goalkeeper with the fluorescent uniform, had a 
different message for his fans. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending 90 minutes looking like a flying scoop of sherbet, diving and 
leaping to help stop 15 of 16 Italian shots, Campos smiled and stuck out his 
tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are surprised we won, but now . . . everybody watch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who watched the Mexicans overcome a one-goal deficit -- there was a full 
house of 53,186 -- saw a confident team playing a tentative one. A speedy team 
playing a stumbling one. A strong-willed team playing a dispassionate one. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not difficult to tell which team belonged to Mexico. At game's end, the 
Mexicans leaped into one another's arms while their thousands of bouncing fans 
literally rocked the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians? They hid their heads in their shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to be partying in Mexico City tonight," forward Luis Roberto 
Alves said, accurately predicting a celebration around the Angel of 
Independence monument. "They are going to bring that angel down." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time Mexico has advanced to the second round of a World Cup 
tournament on foreign soil. In their previous nine Cup finals, they have been 
quarterfinalists twice, both times in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also perhaps the first time in this World Cup that a team played for a 
tie, watched the strategy backfire, then survived to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first half that left no doubt of the Mexicans' defensive 
intentions -- they didn't shoot until the 28th minute -- Italy made them pay in 
the third minute of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouncing a pass from Demetrio Albertini off his chest, Daniele Massaro, who 
had come in as a substitute to start the second half, slipped between defenders 
Claudio Suarez and Ramirez Perales and fired a 15-yard shot into the net past 
Campos. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "I forget," Campos said later, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the entire team immediately acted as if it forgot. Showing no signs 
of depression, the Mexicans immediately mounted a counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes later, midfielder Marcelino Bernal tied the game with a 25-yard 
shot that illustrated not only the Mexicans' determination, but the Italians' 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 From Alberto Garcia Aspe to Carlos Hermosillo to Bernal, the Mexicans 
completed two simple lateral passes just before the score. The Italians were 
inexplicably unable to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 And who was that Italian defender diving in vain at the last pass before 
Bernal made his kick? Forward Giuseppe Signori, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pulled back, playing the fifth man in our zone," Signori said. "There 
was some mistakes made, but if nobody ever made any mistakes, nobody would ever 
score any goals." 
</P>
<P>
 With their necessary tie intact, the Mexican midfielders and defenders spent 
the rest of the game shoving around the apparently overrated Italian stars. 
</P>
<P>
 When a workmanlike player such as Ignacio Ambriz or del Olmo was beaten, 
Campos was there with a belly flop. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what happened during Italy's final chance, in the 88th minute, when 
Nicola Berti headed a ball that Campos barely knocked left, cutting his finger 
while sealing the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Er, tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tie that was like a victory," said Alves, the sounds of horns and 
whistles still apparent several floors above him outside RFK. "A special, 
special victory."

FIVE-RUN FIFTH POWERS DODGERS PAST GIANTS, 7-4; BASEBALL: DESHIELDS FUELS 
OUTBURST WITH A TWO-RUN DOUBLE. HERSHISER GOES DISTANCE FOR FIRST TIME THIS 
SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The return of Delino DeShields might be the spark the Dodgers need to stay 
atop the Western Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The second baseman, recently returned from the disabled list, hit a key 
two-run double in a five-run fifth inning Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium that 
gave the Dodgers a 7-4 victory over the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory prevented a Giant sweep of the series and put the Dodgers 3 1/2 
games ahead of Colorado and 6 1/2 in front of the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser, who had lost four in a row, looked sharp when he kept the ball 
down. But every time he got the ball up, the Giants knocked the pitch out of 
the park. They hit four home runs, two by Todd Benzinger and one apiece for 
Matt Williams and Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hershiser gave up only one other hit as he went the distance for the first 
time this season. He also hustled home from first on DeShields' double, 
providing the run that put the Dodgers ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Benzinger's second home run in the seventh cut the lead to 6-4, but from then 
on, Hershiser had things under control, retiring the last eight to improve to 
4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza and Raul Mondesi homered in the fifth. Piazza greeted reliever 
Dave Burba with his 19th home run, his fourth home run in the last four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi's 12th homer began the demise of Brian Hickerson (2-7), a left-hander 
who befuddled the Dodgers for four innings. 
</P>
<P>
 In his seven games since returning, DeShields has hit safely in all of them 
and is 12 for 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "With him healthy, we are a much better club," Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda dismissed the Giants' four home runs. "The Giants are a dangerous 
team," he said. "They have a lot of guys who hit the long ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser was simply glad the home runs were all with the bases empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "A solo home run can be a rally buster," he said. "What makes you wonder about 
your pitching is when they get a single here, a double there and then a gapper. 
That's when you get to feeling you don't have it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I pitched much better. I feel I'm getting there. I was a bit 
concerned about control and I gave in too quickly -- and four times the Giants 
made me pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser's next outing will be Sunday against former Dodger Fernando 
Valenzuela, making a comeback with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I weren't pitching I wouldn't want to miss Fernando's return," 
Hershiser said. "It will be something special for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Manager Dusty Baker said that it was Hershiser's at-bat in the fifth 
that was the key play. "He's up there to bunt and we walk him," Baker said. 
"That was the big play of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Rafael Bournigal, making a strong bid to make his role as interim 
shortstop permanent, had two hits, including a run-scoring triple in the sixth 
before being victimized by the hidden ball trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Bournigal's one-out single kept the fifth-inning going. But after Hickerson 
walked Hershiser, he seemed about to wriggle out with a lead when Brett Butler 
looked at a third strike. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields made a loser out of Hickerson when he drilled a pitch into 
left-center field. Bournigal scored easily, and Hershiser followed a little 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second inning, Benzinger, a left-handed hitter, hit an opposite field 
drive into the bleachers for the first hit of the game and his sixth home run 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the fourth, Williams drove a pitch into the left-field seats and the 
Giants had a 2-0 lead. But Mondesi hit his 12th homer to open the fifth. 
Bournigal singled with one out and Hershiser, up to bunt, drew a walk. After 
Brett Butler was called out on strikes, DeShields doubled to left-center to 
score two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza greeted reliever Dave Burba with his 19th home run to complete the 
five-run inning. The Dodgers made it 6-3 in the sixth when Bournigal's two-out 
triple scored Mondesi from first.

DRUG POLICY VIOLATION COSTS GOODEN 60-DAY SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A second link to the New York Mets 1986 World Series champions has been 
sidelined because of a violation of major league baseball's drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Gooden, the last member of that club still with the Mets, was suspended 
by major league baseball for 60 days Tuesday for violating his drug aftercare 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug problems also took former teammate Darryl Strawberry out of the game and 
away from the Dodgers, who suspended him on opening day. He recently signed 
with the San Francisco Giants but has yet to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden, 29, had missed a month of the 1987 season to undergo treatment for 
cocaine use and agreed then to random drug testing as part of the aftercare 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The specific violation was not disclosed by Gooden, the Mets or baseball, but 
Gary Sheffield, Gooden's nephew who plays for the Florida Marlins, said it was 
not for using drugs. Sheffield indicated that Gooden missed a test. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fazing him," Sheffield said Tuesday in Philadelphia. "He's handling 
things well. I'm sure he'll be all right. As long as it's not drugs, everything 
will be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 A statement from Gooden was read by Joe McIlvaine, Mets vice president for 
baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been suspended for breaking the rules of my aftercare program. I'm 
truly sorry it happened," the statement said. "I want to apologize to the club, 
my teammates and to the people of New York. I want to thank everyone for their 
past support. I will be back stronger and better. I want to earn your respect 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden, who is earning $3.7 million this season, recently returned to the Mets 
from a toe injury in late April that had him on the disabled list. He is 3-4 
with a 6.31 earned-run average in 41 1/3 innings and had the worst outing of 
his career last Friday night, allowing nine runs in 5 1/3 innings in a 9-4 loss 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 McIlvaine said he talked to Gooden on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an idea this was coming," he said. "Ten days ago major league baseball 
told us it was conducting an investigation. He didn't see it coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden is in the last year of a three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an ongoing thing. We've been discussing what we were going to do," 
McIlvaine said of re-signing Gooden. "We wanted to watch him pitch and now this 
clouds the issue."

MORNING BRIEFING: SOCCER GOAT BECOMES A PET TO SOME BRITISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the World Cup churns on, England, the nation that claims to have invented 
soccer and does not deny it invented soccer hooliganism, sits on the sideline 
after failing to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 How are the British dealing with this? 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1-selling sports video in England is a documentary, wryly entitled, 
"Do I Not Like That," a stinging account of the national team's failure to 
qualify, reports the New Republic magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who spoke those words is recently replaced English coach Graham 
Taylor, who was caught by the documentary audio tape sputtering the now-famous 
phrase in the aftermath of a particularly grievous on-field error. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor has become a cult figure of sorts in England, appearing in TV 
commercials and, according to the magazine, acting as "a metaphor for all the 
cheerful, clueless, jingoistic know-nothings who characterize England." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Glenn Robinson of Purdue is widely expected to be the No. 1 
selection in today's NBA draft. Who were the last two players from the Big Ten 
conference, in basketball or football, to be selected first overall? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eight are enough: Last week, the bizarre boxing career of Leon Spinks got even 
more bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 Spinks, the star-crossed former heavyweight champion, won a technical knockout 
over Eddie Curry in Raleigh, N.C., when Curry didn't answer the bell for the 
ninth round and was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because Curry thought the bout was scheduled for eight rounds and refused 
to continue when he was told it was 10 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ring announcer Michael Buffer had announced that the bout was scheduled for 10 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolina Boxing Assn. Commissioner Rusty Mitchell disqualified Curry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Channeling: Steve Garvey, in the publisher's note of a recent edition of Sport 
magazine, writes that today's batters are overreacting to inside pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got knocked down, I'd jump up quickly, get back in the box and dare 
that pitcher to throw the ball over the plate," Garvey writes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three-quarters of the time I'd get a hit because I'd channel that same 
emotion that currently drives some to charge the mound for a better purpose -- 
driving the ball up the middle, or better, out of the park." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The most recent No. 1 overall picks in the NFL and NBA drafts 
were Big Ten players. The Cincinnati Bengals selected Ohio State defensive 
lineman Dan Wilkinson with the top pick in last spring's NFL draft, and the 
Orlando Magic selected Michigan forward Chris Webber No. 1, then traded him to 
Golden State, last year. 
</P>

 Quotebook: Philadelphia Phillie team physician Phillip Marone, after 
completing a physical on new acquisition Fernando Valenzuela: "I don't know how 
old he is, but he's in perfect physical shape. His shoulders and elbows are 
fine. If he doesn't pitch well, it's not my fault." TIM KAWAKAMI

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The best thing about the Raiders deciding to remain at the Coliseum this 
season is that they might be the class of the AFC. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They have done as good a job as any contender of keeping their team intact -- 
and improving it in spots -- despite the NFL's new salary cap. . . . Al Davis 
set the tone the day he matched the Denver Broncos' offer sheet for Tim Brown. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Raider season-ticket invoices were sent to subscribers during the weekend. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't look now, but training camp is nearly upon us. Raider rookies will 
report to Oxnard July 10 and the veterans July 15. The team leaves for 
Barcelona July 25 to practice for a game there against the Broncos July 30. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the NFL exhibition season will be starting about the time the 
major league baseball season probably will be shutting down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC customers will be receiving their Coliseum season tickets in the mail in 
August, as usual. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: New White House chief of staff Leon Panetta and boxing promoter 
Bob Arum. . . . Perhaps the worst thing Jose Offerman did in the off-season was 
bulk up. When he reported to Vero Beach, he fancied himself a home run hitter. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nightly sight at Dodger Stadium: Players and umpires swatting away bugs. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when Wade Boggs was traded to the New York Yankees and it was said he 
would never be the same again without the benefits of Fenway Park? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler and Paul Molitor are improving with age. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In case you haven't noticed, Houston first baseman Jeff Bagwell has become an 
early National League Triple Crown candidate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Red Sox's worst trade since sending Babe Ruth to the Yankees for 
$120,000 and a $300,000 loan in 1920 was dealing Bagwell to the Astros for 
relief pitcher Larry Andersen in 1990. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza's batting-practice power displays are nearly as impressive as Jose 
Canseco's. His demonstrations of strength during games are pretty impressive, 
too . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Kingman is one of six San Francisco Giants to hit for the cycle. The 
surprise is that he got the single. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 T-shirt worn by Matt Williams and other Giants: "Dusty's Thugs." . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jockey Jerry Bailey was about as surprised as the rest of us at Santa Anita 
when Arcangues won the 1993 Breeders' Cup Classic and paid $269.20. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I had absolutely no idea how he would run off his European form," Bailey 
said. "In fact, I couldn't even pronounce his name." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Well, it is pronounced Ar-kong and it will be no shock if he wins the $750,000 
Gold Cup Saturday at Hollywood Park, where he will be second choice behind The 
Wicked North. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park head clocker Gary Nelson called a recent six-furlong workout by 
Arcangues "about the most awesome work I've ever seen." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who will fly here Friday night from New York to ride in the Gold Cup, 
is the 36-year-old son of a dentist, a former Texas El Paso student, and in his 
fifth year as president of the Jockeys Guild. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He says Arcangues is capable of beating any horse on any given day, which is 
something that he proved last Nov. 6 in Arcadia. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The NBA draft makes for better television than the NFL draft because each team 
is allowed only five minutes, instead of 15, to make its first-round pick. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 A sleeper could be 6-foot-3 point guard Gaylon Nickerson, who was an NAIA 
All-American at Northwestern Oklahoma State after playing at Kansas State and 
Wichita State. Another possibility is 6-6 swingman Tony Dumas of Missouri 
Kansas City, who was the nation's seventh-leading scorer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Kerrigan and Brian Boitano will be among those performing in the 
Campbell's Soup Tour of World Figure Skating Champions Sunday at the Forum. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Harry Kabakoff, the colorful fight personality best known for managing the 
Pimentel twins, has become a matchmaker in Ensenada, Mexico. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup will miss the South Koreans -- offensive-minded, superbly 
conditioned and spirited, but eliminated in the first round. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's unfortunate that the U.S. team had only six months to find out about the 
change in the yellow-card rule. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had a better record last year on this date, but trailed the Giants 
by 10 1/2 games in the NL West.

 GROUP F at Citrus Bowl, Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands vs. Morocco 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 9:30 a.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat was still tinkering with his lineup 
a day before the game his team must win or tie to avoid the disgrace of 
first-round elimination. Judging by the squads in Tuesday's scrimmage -- and by 
players' comments afterward -- he might use as many as five midfielders today 
and perhaps only two forwards. The four-forward, three-midfielder, 
three-defender formation he used in last Saturday's 1-0 loss to Belgium 
produced many scoring chances, but top scorer Dennis Bergkamp couldn't finish 
them off. Marc Overmars, who started against Saudi Arabia but was a substitute 
in the Belgium game, probably will start up front with Bergkamp and Peter van 
Vossen, who has not played the previous two games. That means Ronald de Boer 
will sit. Another probable new starter is midfielder Rob Witschge, who played 
well defensively in the second half against Belgium. Coach Abdellah Ajri has 
little hope of leading Morocco to the second round, but he hasn't given up. He 
is expected to start Zakaria Alaoui El Ashraf in goal, instead of Khalil Azmi. 
Rachid Azzouzi will move from midfield to defense and Rachid Negrouz will make 
his first start on defense, replacing Nourredine Naybet, who got his second 
yellow card last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Holland, which began the tournament as one of the top contenders, 
is accustomed to desperate situations. The Dutch had to win their last three 
qualifying games after opening with a loss and a tie, and responded 
impressively. They will have to play well to defeat Morocco, which has outshot 
its opponents, 49-23, but has scored only once. Holland will attack as often as 
the heat permits, feeding the ball to Bergkamp as much as possible. Morocco 
will try to slow the pace and mount counterattacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: On talent, the Netherlands should win easily, but Advocaat seems 
unable to inspire his players or win their respect. They openly question his 
tactics and there seems to be little team unity. Holland's experience and 
world-class skills will make the difference and wear Morocco down in the second 
half. Holland by two. HELENE ELLIOTT

 GROUP F at RFK Stadium, Washington D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium vs. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 9:30 a.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: KCSI (Channel 18), ESPN 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: In an earlier last-minute loss to the Netherlands, Saudi 
Arabia proved it has more quickness and stamina than its northern European 
counterparts. This sets up today's prime matchup -- young Saudi scorers Sami Al 
Jaber and Fuad Amin against the only defense in the tournament that has yet to 
give up a goal. Goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme has been outstanding for Belgium, 
particularly in holding the Netherlands scoreless despite 21 shots during a 1-0 
victory over the Dutch last weekend. Michel De Wolf is an outstanding sweeper. 
The Saudi defense, quick and smart enough to shut down Morocco, won't be tested 
as much today. Muhammad Abdul Jawwad is their best player there, having 
survived bouts with top scorers Dennis Bergkamp of the Netherlands and Mohamed 
Chaouch of Morocco. The biggest question for the Saudis is whether goalkeeper 
Muhammad Al Deayea will be as erratic as he was against the Netherlands, or as 
brilliant as he was against Morocco. The Belgians have shown little offense -- 
30 shots in two games -- and need improved performances from forward Josip 
Weber and midfielder Lorenzo Staelens. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: A tie would send the Saudis to the second round in their first 
World Cup finals, an impressive feat for a nation that began playing organized 
soccer 25 years ago. If the Saudis lose, they would be edged out of the second 
round by Russia, because of goal differential, thanks to the Russians' 6-1 
victory over Cameroon on Tuesday. The Belgians have already qualified for the 
second round, so it's only a matter of whom they will play. If they win or tie, 
they clinch first place in Group F and play Ireland next week in Orlando. If 
they lose and the Netherlands defeats Morocco by two goals or more, the 
Belgians would finish second in the group and face Sweden next week in in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Belgium actually might enjoy playing Sweden instead of Ireland, but 
the difference is not enough to make them tank this game. They'll play as if 
they don't care, which will be fine with the overmatched Saudis, who consider 
this the most important athletic contest in their country's history. It will 
finish in a 1-1 tie. BILL PLASCHKE

 "What first comes to my mind is: They (the Arabs) are hungry! That's what 
makes their football.Those guys would give their life on the field. Did you see 
the reaction of that No. 6 (Faud Amin) when he shot his goal facing Holland? He 
was like a madman, not wanting to be touched, and he started to run around the 
ground. None of us would have such an attitude in such circumstances. One could 
see that, for that player, feelings were going far beyond the context of 
football. Those guys have so many things to prove to their people."

 Mexican stocks declined amid concern that U.S. interest rates may rise and 
U.S. economic could slow, according to traders, but that decline was arrested 
about noon, after the Mexican national team tied Italy, 1-1, in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico advanced to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 After the bolsa index fell 20.61 points, share prices jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question, the market sentiment improved," after Mexico advanced to the 
second round, said Ron Villa, a trader at Invex, Casa de Bolsa. "After the game 
people found bargains and bid up prices." 
</P>
<P>
 The bolsa index finished the day down 6.46 points.

 The World Cup nearly experienced its first serious confrontation between fans 
Tuesday when several dozen Italian fans tried to parade down 22nd Street in 
front of RFK Stadium in Washington before the game between Italy and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Mexican fans had already staked out a spot on 22nd Street and 
refused to move. The two groups stared at each other, but after a few assorted 
shoves, the Italians retreated. BILL PLASCHKE

 The World Cup has been able to do something the United Nations hasn't in 
Rwanda: create a cease fire in the country where some 200,000 have died in a 
war that began April 6.

 Children play soccer in refugee camps amid the thud of mortar fire and 
delivery of casualties, but when the World Cup is on television -- particularly 
when the game involves Rwandan favorite Nigeria -- the guns fall silent.

 "I wonder if both sides aren't doing the same thing," said U.N. commander Maj. 
Gen. Romeo Dalliare, "powering up generators and watching football instead of 
fighting for a while. We could use more of that in Kigali."

 German Coach Berti Vogts said in Chicago that he had sent Stefan Effenberg

 The fans were yelling at Effenberg for his play, which contributed to South 
Korea's comeback from a 3-0 deficit. The faster Koreans took advantage of 
Effenberg's slowness at the German right flank, where he was playing for 
injured Thomas Strunz.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; USING YOUR HEAD IS UN-AMERICAN

 Exchange between columnist Mike Royko and his pal, Slats: 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why soccer will never be a really popular TV sport in this country," 
Slats said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because in soccer they bounce the ball off their heads, and to Americans, it 
is undignified to bounce a ball off your head unless you are having a boozy 
back-yard party. Name me one other sport where you bounce the ball off your 
head." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that you mention it, I can't think of one. 
</P>
<P>
 "See? What happens if a football player is waiting to catch a punt or a pass 
and it bounces off his helmet?" 
</P>
<P>
 The fans would hoot and jeer and shout that he is incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what happens if a baseball player is waiting for a fly ball and it 
bounces off his head?" 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt, the scene would be shown on every network's sports highlights and 
the player would forever be held up to ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely. In the movies, if they want to get a laugh they have something to 
bounce off a head. In the Three Stooges, it was always 'boink, boink' off 
Curley's head. So, bouncing a ball off your head is un-American. Besides, it 
makes people shorter." 
</P>
<P>
 It does? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure. That's why most foreigners are shorter than Americans. All those balls 
bouncing off their heads compress their necks and spines."

conclusion, it is time to consider the greatest achievements of the competition 
thus far. Some Half-Term Awards: 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolate Drop Award, in memory of the remark, "If he were a chocolate drop, 
he'd eat himself": It goes to Tony Meola, future film star (he hopes), poseur 
and shot-dropper.His woeful positioning allowed Romania the only goal (against 
the United States). 
</P>
<P>
 Goal Celebration of the Tournament: Diego Maradona's eye-bulging run at the 
camera had its points, but for the sheer ferocious joy, we must salute Rashidi 
Yekini of Nigeria for the fists-through-the-net roar of triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Smart(aleck) Award: a title hotly contested by just about every 
columnist in America capable of spelling his own name. However, based as I am 
on the West Coast, I have to doff my cap to Mike Downey, of the Los Angeles 
Times, for managing to annoy me every single day. 
</P>
<P>
 Amiable nut case of the tournament: Jorge Campos, Mexico's goalie, he of the 
mad outfits and silly journeys upfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-point degree of difficulty high diving award: Juergen Klinsmann, a diver 
for all seasons. Nine-point award: everybody else in the German team. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble Loser Award: South Korea, for its stirring 3-2 defeat against Germany. 
Second noblest loser: United States, for its 1-0 defeat against Romania.

 Russian defender Viktor Onopko said he was surprised that any team could score 
six goals in a World Cup game.But when it happened in his team's 6-1 victory 
over Cameroon on Tuesday, he said he was not surprised it came against an 
African team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cameroon's defense was very weak, disorganized," he said. "That is not only 
the Cameroon team but a specific feature of the African teams. They are 
disorganized." RANDY HARVEY

 Because of some earlier colorful language used during an altercation with a 
game official, Jack Charlton, Ireland's coach, was forced by FIFA to watch 
Tuesday's game against Norway from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't stop him from sending instructions to assistant coach Maurice 
Setters by telephone, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched the match from where the television cameras are, just to the right 
of the center line," Charlton said. "It was quite good up there. The only thing 
was, you're not in the presence of your players. So you pick the phone up and 
you tell Maurice what you want him to do and how to handle the situation. To 
Maurice's credit, he did everything exactly right today."

 Football is an irresistible aphrodisiac, it seems, and a baby boom is expected 
in Ireland in nine months' time from couples carried away by watching 
Charlton's side in action. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Ireland's first two World Cup matches, in Dublin up to 100 
women more than usual have taken the morning-after birth pill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Well Woman Center, which dispenses the pill, has been caught on the hop, 
and believes that the football might lead to scores of unplanned pregnancies.

 Ireland's best scoring chance in a 0-0 tie with Norway was John Sheridan's 
second-half attempt to, at full run, chip a shot over the head of Norway goalie 
Erik Thorstvedt.And Sheridan almost did it.

 "Sheridan's chip shot was like watching something in slow motion," Charlton

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; OH, THE SHAME OF IT ALL: BRAZIL TIES 
SWEDEN; GROUP B: TOURNAMENT FAVORITES STILL WIN DIVISION, WITH SWEDES SECOND 
AFTER 1-1 DRAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cellular phones came at Carlos Alberto Parreira like knives. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian journalists screamed questions -- machine-gun fast -- at the 
national soccer coach, then hysterically relayed the terrible news back home 
into their phone receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The terrible news? 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday afternoon, a day that will not live in glory, Brazil clinched the 
Group B title in the World Cup with a 1-1 tie against Sweden before 77,217 at 
the Pontiac Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Still the World Cup favorite, Brazil advanced to the second round and will 
next meet the United States at Palo Alto on Monday, the Fourth of July. Sweden 
will play the second-place finisher from Group F, still to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact: Neither Brazil nor Sweden was motivated to win. The Swedes, who took an 
early 1-0 lead, knew at intermission that Russia was beating up on Cameroon, a 
result that automatically assured Sweden's advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes admitted that they had not really tried to score in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Brazil tied the game in the 47th minute, both teams seemed content to 
play out the string. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, for Brazil, a tie was as good as victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotionally, however, it was another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Hordes of drum-pounding Brazilians whistled derisively as their team played it 
safe. They booed when Parreira removed star midfielder, Rai, in the 83rd 
minute, seeing this as concession. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters challenged Parreira afterward for his "defensive" strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira blamed the Swedes, who packed their defense to slow the Brazilian 
assault. Parreira also blamed the smaller-than-standard soccer dimensions at 
the Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira insisted his team had been trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you see how many times (defender) Leonardo went forward?" Parreira 
shouted. "My God! We didn't change. We did what we had to do. We finished first 
in our group. We didn't change. But how can you penetrate with no space? You 
have to be patient, be cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilians are rarely that when it comes to their soccer team. With less than 
a dominating performance, you could sense an underlying uneasiness of Brazil 
now having to play the United States on its turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations for Brazil are incredible. A loss to the United States would be 
unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not want to play the U.S. on their Independence Day," said Mario 
Zagalo, the Brazilian assistant coach.  
</P>
<P>
 But Brazilian coaches and player were quick to note that Tuesday's game was 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like a friendly, " Parreira said. "It was a matter of who was 
going to finish first or second place, no more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunga, the Brazilian defender, assured anyone who would listen that there are 
no problems with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ugly for the players to play because there was no game to be played, 
because of Sweden," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes, who gladly took the tie, rarely challenged the Brazilian goal 
after scoring in the 24th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's goal was brilliantly executed, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a crossing pass from Tomas Brolin on his chest, left of the goal, 
forward Kennet Andersson allowed the ball to bounce once before striking a shot 
over the head of Claudio Taffarel, the Brazilian goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil spent most of the first half passing the ball back and forth, often in 
its own end, but came out firing after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 47th minute, Romario dribbled his way through three defenders and 
pushed a shot past goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil kept up the pressure, but its effort produced only occasional chances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes, most of whom towered over the Brazilians, clogged the goal area 
with defenders and didn't mind using their bodies in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersson, who moved up to take suspended forward Martin Dahlin's spot, said 
the U.S. team could learn a thing or two by watching Tuesday's game film. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagalo, the Brazilian assistant, tried to put the U.S. game in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the American basketball team plays Brazil, we pray," he said. "I hope 
you guys pray when the Brazilian soccer teams play the U.S."

 Philadelphia Phillie catcher Darren Daulton suffered a broken right shoulder 
in Tuesday night's 2-1 loss to the Florida Marlins and will be sidelined for 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Daulton, a National League All-Star the last two seasons, was hit in the 
shoulder by two foul balls during the game.After the second, in the ninth 
inning, he was clearly in pain as he tried to throw the ball back to the mound 
and he left the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He leads the Phillies in homers with 15 and runs batted in with 56 and is 
batting .300. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests of Don Mattingly's sore right wrist showed no significant injury, but 
the New York Yankee first baseman sat out Tuesday night's game against the 
Boston Red Sox. His status is listed as day to day. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants led all National League outfielders in 
voting for the All-Star team. The top vote-getter in the next-to-last results 
was shortstop Ozzie Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals, with 2,904,866 votes, 
while Bonds had 1,953,261. 
</P>
<P>
 Other position leaders were catcher Mike Piazza of the Dodgers, second baseman 
Mariano Duncan of the Phillies, third baseman Matt Williams of the Giants and 
first baseman Gregg Jefferies of the Cardinals.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WORRELL SAYS HE'S FEELING SHARP AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Worrell doesn't expect all his outings to be good ones, but he does feel 
he is improving. The ace of the Dodger bullpen has four consecutive saves and 
several sharp outings. 
</P>
<P>
 "All pitchers, especially relievers, know they won't be sharp every time," the 
right-hander said. "But I have been working hard and I am beginning to see the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was having trouble, I knew I had to pitch myself out of it. It didn't 
help a bit for me to sit out four games. You just have to keep pitching. I feel 
good about the way it's going right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching coach Ron Perranoski is also pleased with Worrell's progress. Before 
elbow trouble struck a few years ago, Worrell, now 34, was one of the best 
closers in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's starting to pitch the way we expected," Perranoski said. "When he came 
back from his side injury, he was strong, but he didn't pitch well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he's doing a good job of changing speeds and he is spotting his pitches 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers are trying to get rookie Rafael Bournigal to do the things they 
couldn't get his predecessor, Jose Offerman, to do -- hit down on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hit down on the ball," Manager Tom Lasorda yelled at his new shortstop as he 
stood in the batting cage. When Bournigal lashed a line drive to left, Lasorda 
led the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch (Brett) Butler," Lasorda said. "He leads the league in singles every 
year. He also earns $3.8 million. Watch him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants' pitching problems persist. Before the game they put their best 
starter, Bill Swift, on the 15-day disabled list and brought up Brad Brink from 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Already out of action are Mike Jackson, Mark Portugal and Kevin Rogers. DAN

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; VALENZUELA IMPRESSIVE IN RETURN TO MAJORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Valenzuela surprised everyone but himself with an impressive return 
to the major leagues Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us didn't think he could throw that hard," said Benito Santiago of 
the Florida Marlins after the Marlins defeated the Philadelphia Phillies, 2-1, 
at Philadelphia on Jerry Browne's ninth-inning sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who was with Jalisco of the Mexican League before signing with the 
Phillies on Friday, left after six innings. He gave up six hits and one 
unearned run, walked two and struck out one in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who is scheduled to pitch Sunday against the Dodgers, said he knew 
he could still pitch in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had all my stuff working good," he said, singling out his slider, which 
handcuffed many right-handed batters inside. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he felt "a little excited" when he first took the mound, but 
otherwise, "It was a normal game for me. I don't think it's anything new to me. 
I have been doing this for many years." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela's first start at Philadelphia since August 29, 1990, a Dodger 
victory, triggered an outbreak of Fernandomania. Walkup sales of 10,000 boosted 
attendance to 47,027. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida scored its only run against Valenzuela after Chuck Carr reached on an 
error by first baseman John Kruk in the third. Kruk dropped Mariano Duncan's 
throw on a ground ball to third. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr stole second, moved to third on Gary Sheffield's single and scored on 
Jeff Conine's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 10-3, San Diego 9-11 -- The Padres salvaged a split of a doubleheader 
at Denver, winning the nightcap in 11 innings after squandering an 8-0 lead in 
the opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Nieves hit a pinch run-scoring single and Tony Gwynn a two-run single 
in the Padres' nine-run 11th inning. A wild pitch and hit batsman allowed two 
more runs, and three more came home when pitcher Darren Holmes and shortstop 
Walt Weiss made errors on Brad Ausmus' bases-loaded bouncer up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's nine runs were the most ever in the 11th inning of a National 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opener, the Rockies' comeback included a pinch-hit grand slam by Howard 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 8, Atlanta 7 -- Wil Cordero's run-scoring single finished a two-run 
rally in the ninth inning at Montreal, sending the Braves to their fourth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Rondell White opened the ninth against Steve Bedrosian (0-1) with a single. 
After Moises Alou walked, Larry Walker singled for one run, and Cordero 
followed with his single, Montreal's 16th hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 6, Chicago 5 -- Brian Hunter hit his first career grand slam and 
Don Slaught also homered for the Pirates at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates got what proved to be the winning run in the seventh as Orlando 
Merced greeted reliever Dave Otto with a single that scored Jay Bell, who had 
doubled with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 8, New York 6 -- Ozzie Smith broke a tie with a two-out run-scoring 
double in the seventh and the Cardinals added four runs in the eighth at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury (9-7) ended his losing streak at six. He went six innings, 
giving up three runs and six hits and striking out three and walking none. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 5, Houston 3 -- Reggie Sanders had a home run and two doubles and 
Bret Boone added two hits and two runs batted in for the Reds at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 John Smiley (7-8) recorded his fourth consecutive victory, giving up three 
runs on nine hits over 6 1/3 innings. Jeff Brantley got the final three outs 
for his eighth save.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; HOBSON EJECTED IN LOSS, SHOVES AN UMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manager Butch Hobson of the Boston Red Sox had to be restrained by two of his 
players after shoving an umpire three times during an argument in a 10-4 loss 
to the New York Yankees on Tuesday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson shoved umpire Larry Barnett after being thrown out of the game by plate 
umpire Greg Kosc. Hobson had come onto the field to argue after Kosc warned 
relief pitcher Sergio Valdez for a pitch that sailed behind the back of Jim 
Leyritz with two outs in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hobson was ejected, he went after Kosc. Barnett stepped between them and 
Hobson shoved Barnett three times in an attempt to get to Kosc. Catcher Damon 
Berryhill grabbed Hobson from behind and first baseman Mo Vaughn blocked 
Hobson's path. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They were) pretty good shots," Barnett said. "In fact, I may have a wrenched 
back. It hurts like hell. I felt like a pinball. I was in there just trying to 
stop him from making contact with Greg, and I took the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett, the crew chief, said he planned to call American League president 
Bobby Brown late Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson said he reacted after getting shoved first by Kosc. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he ejected me, he shoved me and I got (angry). He pushed me, it's as 
simple as that," Hobson said. "He can get in my face, he can cuss, but I didn't 
deserve to get pushed." 
</P>
<P>
 Kosc denied pushing Hobson. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the seventh in a row for the Yankees, who got three runs 
batted in from Daryl Boston while overcoming a 4-0 deficit and sending the Red 
Sox to their 11th consecutive loss at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox' home losing streak is their second-longest since they moved to 
Fenway Park in 1912. They lost 14 in a row in 1926. 
</P>

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; HUDLER GIVEN A RARE OPPORTUNITY 
</P>

 Chili Davis is still bothered by a sore right groin and Bo Jackson's history 
against Bobby Witt -- hitless in 11 at-bats with eight strikeouts -- added up 
to Rex Hudler's first start as a designated hitter Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shake yourself, Hud," Hudler said, smiling. "There was a time when I couldn't 
hit my way out of a paper sack, when I figured I would be lucky to stick in the 
game another month. Now, I'm a DH in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tribute to perseverance. I thank the good Lord for that and I thank 
(former manager) Buck Rodgers for giving me a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, whose major league career has been revived this season after a year 
with the Yakult Swallows in Japan, looked around the visitors' clubhouse in 
Oakland Coliseum and was reminded of his first start in the majors a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in this same park," Hudler said, "I was with the Yankees, (Don) 
Mattingly was hurt and (Don) Baylor and (Ken) Griffey (Sr.) didn't want to play 
first. (Manager) Billy Martin said, 'Hey, kid, can you play first base?' I 
jumped off the bench and screamed, 'What a question!' 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day, I was in the lineup at first base and went one for two. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that was 10 years ago, when I couldn't hit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels optioned catcher Chris Turner to triple-A Vancouver and recalled 
catcher Andy Allanson from the Canadians. Turner, who was batting .138, will 
alternate between catcher and designated hitter with Jorge Fabregas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll both be in the lineup every day," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "We 
didn't want to let (Turner) languish here hitting like that. This way, he can 
get the at-bats to get the swing back he showed last year when he hit .280 in 
75 at-bats." 
</P>
<P>
 Allanson, who batted .244 in 477 major league games with Cleveland, Detroit 
and San Francisco, was batting .261 with three homers for Vancouver. 
</P>

 Davis says his injury is an irritation of scar tissue from a surgical 
procedure when he was a newborn. "I've got this," he said, showing a six-inch 
scar on the inside of his right thigh, "and it kind of got pulled. I had the 
same problem with it in spring training. It just kind of grabs." JOHN WEYLER

MEDIA MONITOR: '90S FAMILY; SIBLING REVELRY HIDES REAL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARROLL LACHNIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's On: "Frasier," a half-hour comedy broadcast Thursday nights at 9:30 on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Family Portrait: Frasier Crane is a Seattle psychiatrist who hosts a radio 
call-in show. His live-in family consists of his father, a crotchety cop 
retired on disability, and his father's eccentric, possibly psychic caretaker, 
Daphne. Also living in Seattle is Frasier's younger brother, Niles, a jittery 
little package of neuroses who's also a psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Back Story: The brothers fancy themselves very different: Frasier is a 
Freudian, Niles a Jungian. Frasier is unhappily divorced, Niles is enmeshed in 
a marriage to a bizarre but wealthy woman. Yet the two men are virtual twins: 
Supercilious, high-strung intellectuals who banter in bon mots about their 
Italian shoes, knowledge of German opera and appreciation of African art. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuse Time: The brothers are fiercely competitive. When Niles, desperate to 
fulfill his dream of being published, persuades Frasier to help him write a 
book about sibling relationships, their lifelong rivalry is laid bare. And it 
isn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 Telling Quote: "I'm just fed up with being second all the time," Niles screams 
just before the fisticuffs begin. "I wanted to be a psychiatrist like Mom way 
before you did. But because you were older, you got there first. . . . By the 
time I get around to doing anything, it's all chewed meat!" 
</P>
<P>
 Prescription Pad: "Frasier" plays the Crane brothers' hostility for laughs, 
but that hostility is rooted in a real issue. The feeling of competition and 
resentment develops in childhood as siblings vie for their parents' love, said 
Dr. Rosalyn Laudati, a psychologist who practices in Brea and Newport Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 That's not where it ends, however. "Sibling rivalry never dies," she said. The 
Crane brothers have intensified the rivalry by taking up the same profession, a 
situation Laudati sees frequently. Sometimes, sibling rivalry dissipates as 
people grow up, she said. "If people have achieved their goals and are 
satisfied with their lives, there's less chance that sibling rivalry will get 
worse," she said. "But if they're at midlife, and they're unhappy . . . that 
can breed more resentment toward the other." 
</P>
<P>
 With their training, the Cranes could try to undo the knot of brotherly envy. 
But they would be a rare case, Laudati said: "Adults are rarely motivated to 
work on this with their sibs unless there's a crisis." 
</P>

Cracks Down on Deadbeat Parents 
</P>
<P>
 Maine has begun to enforce one of the nation's toughest laws against "deadbeat 
parents," revoking the driving and professional licenses of nine men who 
ignored repeated warnings to pay child support, officials said this week. The 
men are the first to face sanctions under the year-old law that has garnered 
the state $11.5 million from 9,000 delinquent parents simply by threatening to 
go after their licenses.  
</P>
<P>
 Maine's law is being studied by the Clinton Administration as a possible 
national model for the collection of overdue child support. The nine men having 
both their driving and professional licenses revoked owe a total of $150,000 in 
child support payments. Most Teens Adopted as Babies Thrive, Study Says 
</P>
<P>
 Most teen-agers who were adopted as infants are thriving, according to a 
four-year study of 715 families in Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin. 
"What seems particularly important is the way parents deal with adoption in the 
family," said Dr. Peter L. Benson, president of the Minneapolis-based Search 
Institute, which conducted the study. "Quiet, open communication about adoption 
seems to be the key."  
</P>
<P>
 The study did not examine children adopted after infancy but said they face 
struggles. "We cannot overstate the power of early placement," Benson said. The 
$1-million study, conducted for the National Institute of Mental Health, was 
released last week and was described as the largest survey of adoptive families 
ever conducted in the United States. Even Dads Get the Post-Natal Blues 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one in 10 fathers suffers serious post-natal depression, British 
researchers say. Increasing numbers are breaking down under the pressure of 
sharing domestic chores, coping with the new baby and continuing as 
breadwinner. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the joy of the birth is short-lived as they go into a spiral of 
decline marked by increasing malaise. They take sick days off from work and 
suffer restless nights even if the baby doesn't cry. But men rarely seek 
treatment or admit they have a problem. And Finally.... 
</P>
<P>
 A letter in the July issue of Baby Talk magazine contains what the writer 
calls politically correct terms for parents: differently digested (spitting 
up); containing waste material (dirty diaper); regrouping energies (napping); 
relocating nutrition source (throwing food); individual follicle removal 
(pulling hair).

GOLF NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK; FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT SLICES INTO RIVER VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Keane knows the Santa Ana River can be an inhospitable host. 
</P>
<P>
 He has seen heavy winter rains swell the river and inundate much of River View 
Golf Course, which he owns with his mother, Pat Keane, and his friend, Steve 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 So it wasn't much of a shock when the Army Corps of Engineers started hacking 
into fairways with earth-moving equipment several months ago. The work, part of 
a $1.4-billion flood control project along the river, has closed most of River 
View's back nine holes. But the rest of the course is still open for play. 
</P>
<P>
 It's now a nine-hole course again, as it was when the Keanes and Hart bought 
it in 1988 -- just in much better shape. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners were resourceful when they learned of the flood-control plans about 
a year ago. Instead of fighting the federal government, they asked the Army 
Corps of Engineers to take the course into account. Along much of the project, 
a concrete channel is being built. On this stretch, roughly between 17th Street 
and Memory Lane, there will be a gentle slope covered with earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Army Corps of Engineers have been great," Keane said. "They changed their 
whole design to make sure the golf course could go back in." 
</P>
<P>
 After this phase of the flood-control project, scheduled to be finished this 
winter, River View's back nine will be reconstructed. When the full course 
reopens -- the owners are hoping for August, 1995 -- it will be par 71 instead 
of 70 and about 6,500 yards instead of 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, they say, the river shouldn't cause as many problems as it did 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the sod from the greens on the back nine has been added to the 
putting green. The course now has about 30,000 square feet of putting surface, 
which will be used for an 18-hole putting course expected to open Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put our heart and souls and wallets into building those greens and to see 
someone tearing them out with a tractor would have been painful," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keane says River View, located near the Bristol-Santa Clara intersection in 
Santa Ana, is one of the best golf bargains in the county. Weekday greens fees 
are $10 for nine holes and $14 for 18; on weekends it's $10 and $16. Range 
balls are $5 for a large bucket and golfers may hit off either grass or mats. 
There will be no charge for using the putting course. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, it's rarely crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody really knows about it because it's off the beaten track," Keane said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Open man: Anaheim's Don Shevorski will compete in his third consecutive U.S. 
Senior Open when he tees off Thursday at the No. 2 course at Pinehurst Country 
Club in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Shevorski, 53, a longtime amateur player, turned professional when he turned 
50. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting a little tired of playing against the college kids," 
</P>
<P>
 Shevorski said by phone from Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
 Shevorski, a tour representative for a golf club company, has played in about 
five Senior PGA Tour events. He missed the Senior Open cut by two strokes in 
1992 and struggled last year after learning about two hours before his tee time 
that he had made the field as an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have these expectations of winning the Open," he said. "I want to 
play and I want to do well. It's a dream: you want to play golf with the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no illusions of being able to beat Jack Nicklaus. That won't happen 
but I'd like to do well and make the cut. Most of all I'd like to have fun."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; HUDLER GIVEN A RARE OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chili Davis is still bothered by a sore right groin and Bo Jackson's history 
against Bobby Witt -- hitless in 11 at-bats with eight strikeouts -- added up 
to Rex Hudler's first start as a designated hitter Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shake yourself, Hud," Hudler said, smiling. "There was a time when I couldn't 
hit my way out of a paper sack, when I figured I would be lucky to stick in the 
game another month. Now, I'm a DH in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tribute to perseverance. I thank the good Lord for that and I thank 
(former manager) Buck Rodgers for giving me a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, whose major league career has been revived this season after a year 
with the Yakult Swallows in Japan, looked around the visitors' clubhouse in 
Oakland Coliseum and was reminded of his first start in the majors a decade 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in this same park," Hudler said, "I was with the Yankees, (Don) 
Mattingly was hurt and (Don) Baylor and (Ken) Griffey (Sr.) didn't want to play 
first. (Manager) Billy Martin said, 'Hey, kid, can you play first base?' I 
jumped off the bench and screamed, 'What a question!' 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day, I was in the lineup at first base and went one for two. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that was 10 years ago, when I couldn't hit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels optioned catcher Chris Turner to triple-A Vancouver and recalled 
catcher Andy Allanson from the Canadians. Turner, who was batting .138, will 
alternate between catcher and designated hitter with Jorge Fabregas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll both be in the lineup every day," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "We 
didn't want to let (Turner) languish here hitting like that. This way, he can 
get the at-bats to get the swing back he showed last year when he hit .280 in 
75 at-bats." 
</P>
<P>
 Allanson, who batted .244 in 477 major league games with Cleveland, Detroit 
and San Francisco, was batting .261 with three homers for Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lewis, with triple-A Vancouver while rehabilitating a neck injury, has 
had "three good outings," according to Lachemann and is "pretty close to being 
ready." Lewis threw 2 2/3 scoreless innings Monday night and earned the victory 
during a 6-2 win over Tacoma. When might he return to the team? "When we have 
the feeling that he's going to be better than someone we have here," Lachemann 
said. JOHN WEYLER

MCKEON PASSES EARLY TESTS AS HART WINS WATTS GAMES FOOTBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve McKeon admits he was a bit nervous a couple of weeks ago before making 
his debut as Hart High's quarterback at the Watts Summer Games.  
</P>
<P>
 And although he never doubted his ability to lead the team's offense, he 
discovered the competition was solid at the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those teams are pretty tough and I came to realize real quick that 
they're good," he said. "They are a lot quicker and better than the teams I 
faced on the freshman and sophomore teams." 
</P>
<P>
 So how did McKeon get through the pregame jitters?  
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept telling myself, 'Hey relax! Just go down and score.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently it worked. McKeon who will be a junior in the fall, led Hart to its 
first Watts Summer Games football title Sunday at Compton College. 
</P>
<P>
 He led the Indians to a 7-6 victory over Muir in the final and a 26-6 victory 
over Trabuco Hills in a semifinal.  
</P>
<P>
 Hart defeated Bell, 26-0, Los Angeles, 31-0, and Carson, 20-13, last week to 
advance to the semifinal.  
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Hart could finish no better than third in its passing 
tournament on Saturday, losing to San Marino, 12-6, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's getting better each day," said Hart offensive coordinator Dean 
Herrington. "We expect good things from him in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon (5-foot-8, 150 pounds) was quick to compliment his receivers. J.B. 
Neslon, who will be a junior in the fall, had three touchdown receptions 
against Trabuco Hills and senior Chris McCabe caught a 37-yard pass for Hart's 
only touchdown in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 McCabe was named tournament most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris went up and out and jumped over Muir defenders," Herrington said. "He 
impressed a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson is the team's quickest receiver, according to Herrington. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's only 5-foot-9, but he's not afraid to take a lick to catch a ball," 
Herrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 No other Valley team reached a final in the Games. Moorpark lost to Banning, 
3-0, in the semifinal of the boys' soccer tournament and the Kennedy boys' 
basketball team lost, 48-33, to Dorsey in the semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
 The Crescenta Valley boys' basketball team fell to Morningside, 47-40, in the 
round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kennedy's best basketball showing in almost two decades of 
participating in the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 128-team tournament, which featured many of the Southland's top programs, 
was the largest event in the Games.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was very satisfying for us," Kennedy Coach Yutaka Shimizu said. "We have 
everybody back from last year so there's a natural progression." 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Cougars went 5-1 in the tournament. Dominguez beat Dorsey, 92-58 
for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 In track and field, Birmingham's Adriana Garcia won the girls' high jump and 
Birmingham's Alejandro Dinajero won the boys' 800 and 1,600 meters.

GOLF / STEVE ELLING; O'BRIEN'S PRESENT TO GRANDPA A BIG HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There haven't been many smiles lately around the Jones household in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Biff Jones, the kind of guy who won't go to the doctor unless someone is 
dragging him by the collar, has been laid up with heart trouble for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabin fever has set in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves to play golf," said Susan O'Brien, Jones' daughter. "He really 
misses not being able to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was a boffo day for Biff, not to mention his grandson, Shane O'Brien of 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Late that afternoon, O'Brien walked through the door of his grandparents' home 
and handed Jones the trophy he earned earlier in the day for winning the L.A. 
City Men's Championship at Rancho Park Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's mother Susan said her son was "on cloud nine." His gesture gave the 
entire family a big lift. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Jones' 72nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made my mom cry," Susan O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane acknowledged his grandfather's support when he presented the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very inspirational," Shane said. "He's done a lot for me over the 
years, you know, being my grandpa." 
</P>
<P>
 The present was a big hit. So are most of O'Brien's tee shots. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, a 1991 graduate of Hart High who attended College of the Canyons for 
the past three years, has achieved a measure of notoriety for his startling 
performances in long-drive contests. Opponents half-jokingly refer to the 
6-foot-4, 240-pound golfer as "that football player," which he isn't.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither is he a lumbering masher on a baseball team, though he calls himself a 
"power hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, 20, can jolt a golf ball more than 300 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But acreage aside, that's only a small fraction of the game. Sunday, he put it 
all together with a scintillating seven-under-par 64 at Rancho, his lowest 
competitive round ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine what the afternoon was like for Bob Valerio of Hawthorne, the 54-hole 
leader at 214 after rounds at Harding, Wilson and Rancho golf courses. Valerio, 
paired with O'Brien, started Sunday with a two-stroke lead, shot 69 . . . and 
lost by two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of felt sorry for him," O'Brien said. "He played great. I bet if you'd 
have asked him if he'd take 69 in the final round, he would have taken it and 
walked off the course." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, O'Brien ran him off. Through 12 holes, Valerio still held a one-shot 
lead. But O'Brien promptly birdied the next three holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerio walked a few yards ahead of O'Brien on the par-four 15th hole as the 
latter hit a wedge to the green. It stopped four feet from the stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Give Valerio credit, he knows when his goose is cooked. After O'Brien hit the 
approach shot, Valerio grabbed a white towel, waved it over his head and 
yelled, "No more, no more." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time O'Brien got home, his mother said he was "just glowing," which is 
only appropriate, since O'Brien nuked the back nine with a five-under 31.  
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that during a pro tournament at Rancho, Arnold Palmer once made a 
12 on the par-five 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he made a 12, Palmer said: "I missed a three-footer for an 11." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no lapses for O'Brien. His name will be inscribed on a perpetual 
trophy that includes previous champions Al Geiberger, Duffy Waldorf and Corey 
Pavin. Geiberger once shot 59 in a PGA Tour event.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, who has signed a letter of intent to play next fall at Cal State 
Northridge, experienced the same sense of infallibility. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit 16 of 18 greens in regulation Sunday, recorded six birdies, an eagle 
and needed a mere 27 putts. He routinely hammered the ball off the tee in the 
315-yard range. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't do anything wrong," O'Brien said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've played golf for a lot of years and you always think you're capable of 
something like this if everything goes right. Then you do it, and now I can't 
even describe what it feels like." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grass is greener: Icy, hard and unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting greens at a tough country club course? Nope, Heidi Voorhees' aborted 
first sport, ice skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Voorhees' mother, Joanie, was born in Canada and skated in the Ice Capades for 
a decade. When Heidi happened along, it was only natural that mom had her 
fitted for skates. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi, who lives in Valley Village, started skating when she was 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Voorhees, one of the nation's top female amateurs, didn't exactly warm to the 
sport. Then, not many Californians do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I like being outdoors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said her mom: "Maybe I pushed her too hard. She used to cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Voorhees does the pushing now, on the course. Last weekend, she placed second 
in the Women's Amateur Public Links Championship at Tam O'Shanter Golf Club in 
Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Voorhees, 21, was beaten in the match-play final by former USC teammate Jill 
McGill of Denver, 6 and 4. Both completed their eligibility in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 McGill is playing in the Walker Cup matches later this month in Chattanooga, 
Tenn., on an eight-member U.S. team that includes Emilee Klein of Studio City. 
Voorhees is an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, even mother has to admit that things worked out for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever got a scholarship to USC for ice skating," Joanie cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 McGill's victory in the Publinx marked the second time this summer that she 
knocked off an area player in a national tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, she defeated Andrea Gaston, 36, of Canoga Park in the 
match play final of the 53rd Broadmoor Women's Championship in Colorado Springs 
with a 3-and-2 decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston won the Long Beach City Women's Championship over the weekend with a 
54-hole total of 220. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A leg up: Jim Patterson of Camarillo failed to make the cut at last week's 3rd 
State Senior Amateur Championship at Poppy Hills Golf Course in Pebble Beach. 
He missed by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, being there at all ranks as a notable achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, 68, has had both knees replaced with artificial joints over the 
past five years, which doesn't exactly make a difficult game any easier. 
Particularly in a damp coastal climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cold weather's miserable," he said. "They feel pretty good when it's warm, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pied Piper of Pebble: Apparently, Charlie Wi's popularity knows no bounds. It 
even transcends bloodlines. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mark Johnson of Helendale walked off the driving range last Friday 
moments before facing the affable Wi in the match play round of 16 at the 83rd 
State Amateur Championship at Pebble Beach Golf Links, he found his children 
milling around Wi on the practice putting green. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, who lives in North Hills, was dispatched by Johnson, 4 and 3. But there's 
still some doubt as to who is more popular in the Johnson household. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me (Thursday night), 'Dad, we want Charlie to win,' " Johnson said. 
"I told them, 'Aw, just root for both of us to play well.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Upon further review: The men's course record of 64 at Knollwood Country Club 
in Granada Hills, according to a book called "California Golf," was held by 
current pro David Berganio Jr. of Sylmar.  
</P>
<P>
 It was broken last spring by Granada Hills High standout Darren Angel, who 
shot a nine-under-par 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. George Fee, a chiropractor from Canoga Park and a former captain of the 
Granada Hills golf team, says a teammate shot 61 during a round at Knollwood in 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Fee said the round by Bruce Jacobson was verified by his playing partners and 
that a note on Jacobson's feat appeared in Golf Digest magazine. But at public 
courses, tracking records isn't the No. 1 priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The course record is as good as the memory of the cashier," Fee cracked.

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; INTENSE RIVALRY IN STATE OF 
DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 USC vs. UCLA. Dodgers vs. Giants. Lakers vs. Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal vs. San Mateo? An American Legion rivalry between the in-state 
opponents grew on Sunday, when the teams met for the championship of the Sierra 
Nevada Classic in Reno for the third consecutive year. Westlake-Royal won, 8-3, 
taking its second victory in three championship meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the case with most rivalries, the teams don't seem to like each other. 
</P>
<P>
 When they met during round-robin play earlier in the week, a bench-clearing 
brawl erupted. During the championship game, a Westlake-Royal player was 
ejected for plowing into the San Mateo catcher after both teams were warned 
following a similar incident earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stood toe-to-toe with each other," Westlake-Royal Coach Mike McClure 
said. "We instruct our kids not to throw the first punch, but they will defend 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal players were apparently angered by San Mateo players 
"hot-dogging," McClure said. Emotions ran particularly high after 
Westlake-Royal took a 5-1 lead in the first inning of the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That set the tone for the game because (San Mateo) thought it was going to be 
a rout," McClure said. "They thought they were going to kick our tails." 
</P>
<P>
 San Mateo beat Westlake-Royal, 10-8, on Friday, but Westlake-Royal won the 
championship game behind the pitching of Jay Kenny, who gave up six hits and 
two earned runs in seven innings. Kenny, who will be a junior at Westlake High, 
won two games and was named the best pitcher of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Fernandez and Scott Morris each had two hits in the championship game 
and were also named to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Westlake-Royal: Westlake-Royal was the home team in all six tournament 
games because McClure sent out Tim Carr, who will be a junior at Westlake, to 
call the coin flips. Carr was six for six. 
</P>
<P>
 Although coaches, not players, were supposed to make the call, Westlake-Royal 
slipped Carr in each game for good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The opposing coaches) try to be polite and let the kid make the call, and 
that's their mistake," McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fore!: When Mike Glendenning decided to play for the Valley Rangers, a 
Glendale-based Connie Mack team, in addition to his Woodland Hills West Legion 
team, he didn't know the Rangers were scheduled to play in a tournament in 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 But it might have turned out to be a huge break for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning, a catcher and infielder, hit four home runs and drove in 12 runs 
in six games and won the most valuable player award at the Sierra Nevada 
Classic, perhaps sealing a scholarship offer from the University of Nevada, the 
tournament host. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning, who recently graduated from Crespi, said Nevada coaches have 
offered him a scholarship and that he is waiting for some final paperwork to 
clear. If Wolf Pack coaches had any doubts about his baseball ability, 
Glendenning helped ease them with a 450-foot home run over the center-field 
fence in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was his longest, but every one of them was long," Rangers' Coach Fred 
Bluhm said. "He's shown major league power for probably the last couple years." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning, who has a muscular 6-foot, 205-pound frame, was drafted in the 
63rd round by the St. Louis Cardinals earlier this month. 
</P>

 Deion of West Hills: Adam Crecion did his Deion Sanders imitation Saturday 
when he came directly from practice for an all-star football game to a West 
Hills Legion game, during which he promptly became the hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Crecion, a free safety at Chaminade who is headed to the U.S. Naval Academy, 
scooted from football practice at Pierce College directly to the baseball game 
at Chaminade. He showed up with West Hills batting in the bottom of the fourth 
and trailing, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching Coach Sid Lopez greeted Crecion with the words: "Warm up." 
</P>
<P>
 Crecion threw 10 pitches in the bullpen, then struck out the first batter he 
faced on his way to five scoreless innings. Crecion also hit a home run in his 
first at-bat. West Hills won, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to bring that football mentality onto the baseball field," Crecion 
said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Legion lines: Gabe Feldman of Las Virgenes pitched a no-hitter Sunday against 
Burbank North at Burbank High. Feldman, who will be a senior at Calabasas, 
struck out nine and walked two in seven innings. The game was called after 
seven innings because Las Virgenes had a 17-0 lead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City, which is composed primarily of Sylmar High players, had a team 
batting average of .450 through 10 games, only five of which were Studio City 
victories. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sunland-Tujunga's Mike Spielman was five for five and Jeff Martin hit a grand 
slam and drove in seven runs against Palmdale on Sunday.

 ONLY 10? Irvine Co. senior vice president Larry Thomas knows friends may 
question his decision to give up his high-paying job to work for the reelection 
campaign of old friend and former boss, Gov. Pete Wilson (D1). So Thomas has 
produced his own Letterman-style Top Ten reasons for the move. . . . Among 
them: "I can't stand yet another beautiful Newport Beach summer." "They 
promised me my own cubicle to share with 10 campaign workers." "Who really 
needs a corporate expense account and potential annual bonus?"

 PINE CIRCLE: At American Independence Park near Jerusalem, there's a new 
circle of young pines growing in honor of Newport Beach. They were planted by 
the Jewish National Fund, to honor the city's vigorous tree planting program. .

president Herbert J. Patt told city officials this week: "We thank you for 
having a beautiful city of which we are all proud."

 SHOP TALK: What's the grocery bill for a family of five and two hungry cats? 
Try to match Vicki Cowell of Tustin -- $70 a week. "And that's with three 
teen-age daughters who eat four meals a day," she laughs. . . . Cowell, with a 
master's degree in family resource management, is in demand for seminars on 
bargain shopping, like one she gave at Rancho Santiago College this week. One 
Cowell caution: Plan ahead by studying food ads. "The worst thing is to just 
roam the grocery aisles," she says. "That leads to costly impulse buying."

 NOT JUST A SUNSET: If you've ever traveled Laguna Canyon at sunset, did you 
ever see it this way: "I love the way the hills empurple and sky goes 
nectarine, the way the lights appear like little electric fig seeds, the wet 
west burnishing over into the indeterminate colors of the divine." . . . . 
That's how poet Charles Wright sees it, as part of his "Looking Across Laguna 
Canyon at Dusk, West-by-Northwest," in a recent New Yorker magazine.

 Heading into a July runoff with President Leonid Kravchuk, former Prime 
Minister Leonid Kuchma on Tuesday began courting the supporters of also-rans in 
the first round of voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Final returns showed a nation polarized between the pro-Russian and 
industrialized east, which supported Kuchma, and the more nationalist west, 
which supported Kravchuk. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk had 38% of the vote in Sunday's balloting, while Kuchma finished 
second in the seven-man race with 31%. At least 50% was required to avoid a 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Olexander Moroz, chairman of Parliament and former Socialist leader, came in 
third with 13%. Volodymyr Lanovoy was fourth with 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The date for the runoff has not been set, but the head of the election 
commission, Ivan Yemets, said it will be no later than July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma began courting Lanovoy's supporters by saying he wants Lanovoy, an 
economist, to be part of his government. Lanovoy is the only candidate who 
proposed broad market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma supports closer ties with Russia as a cure for Ukraine's economic 
malaise. The restive Crimea, part of Russia until 1954, gave Kuchma 82% of its 
vote. Sentiment in Crimea runs high in favor reuniting with Russia.

NORMAN GRUTMAN; PENTHOUSE, FALWELL LAWYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norman Roy Grutman, a trial lawyer who defended clients as disparate as the 
Rev. Jerry Falwell and Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, has died of cancer. He 
was 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Grutman died Sunday at his home in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried more than 1,000 cases in his career and spent 18 years as principal 
outside counsel for Guccione and his enterprises, including Penthouse and Omni 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Grutman represented Penthouse when Falwell tried to prevent 
distribution of an issue containing an interview with him. A federal judge 
denied Falwell's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed with Grutman's expertise, Falwell hired Grutman in 1983 to represent 
him in his $45-million lawsuit against Hustler magazine and its publisher, 
Larry Flynt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hustler had run a phony ad that pretended to quote Falwell discussing a sexual 
encounter with his mother and a habit of getting drunk before giving sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 Falwell, claiming emotional distress, was awarded $200,000, but the verdict 
was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Grutman also represented Penthouse when it sued Hustler and Flynt for libel in 
1983. Guccione won a $1.6-million award that was later overturned by an appeals 
court, which said Hustler's depiction of him as an adulterer was "substantially 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 Grutman graduated magna cum laude from Yale in 1953 and from Columbia Law 
School in 1955. He co-authored "Lawyers and Thieves," a 1990 book that 
criticized lawyers and the legal profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Grutman is survived by his wife, Jewel Humphrey; a son, Sasha; a daughter, 
Nila; and a stepson, Bruce Bjork.

DUCKS PULL AN UPSET; KINGS GRAB NO. 1 GOALIE; HOCKEY: ANAHEIM PASSES ON TOP 
PROSPECT TO PICK DEFENSEMAN TVERDOVSKY. L.A. TAKES STORR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Mighty Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira called goaltender Jamie Storr the 
surest bet to become a star of any player in Tuesday's NHL entry draft -- then 
passed over him with the No. 2 pick, allowing the delighted Kings to snag the 
goalie with the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the old cliche -- we couldn't believe the player we wanted was 
available," said new King General Manager Sam McMaster, who rated Storr second 
in the draft behind Radek Bonk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks also passed over Bonk -- the top prospect in many eyes -- after 
Florida made defenseman Ed Jovanovski the No. 1 selection. Ferreira, with no 
tempting trade offers, then used the second pick on Ukranian defenseman Oleg 
Tverdovsky -- a player he insists was their first choice all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonk fell to No. 3, where Ottawa took him in a first round that didn't lack 
for surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' selection of Tverdovsky was the first real upset of the draft -- 
and marked the first time two defensemen have gone 1-2. True, the Ducks had 
little need for another goalie, even if they did consider Storr the best goalie 
in the draft in many years. And though Ferreira says money didn't enter his 
consideration, club President Tony Tavares made it clear the Ducks weren't 
interested in another contract stalemate like the one they're in with Paul 
Kariya, the fourth person taken in the draft last year. That was the prospect 
presented by Bonk, who at 17 starred last season with Las Vegas of the 
International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers ranked Tverdovsky third or fourth, but the Ducks saw it 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him play in Russia, he brought me out of my seat," said Ferreira, 
who describes Tverdovsky as a future quarterback for the Ducks' needy power 
play, though perhaps not as soon as next season. "He's the type of offensive 
defenseman that every team that wins championships has, a Sergei Zubov, a Brian 
Leetch, a Ray Bourque. I'm not comparing him to them, though, I'd never put 
that pressure on him." 
</P>
<P>
 David McNab, the Ducks' director of player personnel, said the difficulty of 
scouting Tverdovsky in Russia might explain the difference of opinions among 
teams -- though most everyone agreed he was the top European player. Tverdovsky 
was scratched from a big tournament McNab tried to attend, and the performance 
that impressed him most came at a game no other scouts witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not something I had to go back and see again," he said. "When you 
shoot the puck as well as he did -- you don't do that one day and never again. 
A pitcher doesn't throw a 95 mile-an-hour fastball one day and never do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky said he was "a little bit surprised to be picked by the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard a new arena has been built," he said. "I know it is called The 
Pond or the Pool, or something to that effect." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who figured Storr would by gone by the seventh pick, got their man 
-- avoiding Brett Lindros, who reportedly had made it clear he didn't want to 
play with Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably would have taken young Lindros -- and worried about it later," 
McMaster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead he got Storr, a player he knows extremely well, having seen him play 
perhaps 100 games when he was a general manager in the Ontario Hockey League 
and Storr played for the OHL's Owen Sound Platers. McMaster also was the 
director of operations of a championship under-17 national team Storr played 
on. Most recently, Storr was named best goaltender of the 1994 World Junior 
tournament, which Canada won. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafting goalies at 18 is considered risky business, but McMaster had no 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best," he said. "He had a .918 save percentage and his team was weak 
defensively. I was in junior hockey 18 years and never saw another like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Storr also is used to facing a lot of shots -- something the King goalies know 
all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I averaged about 48 a game during the regular season and 51 a game during the 
playoffs. I'm used to seeing the puck a lot. It only makes you better," said 
Storr, who, in contrast to Lindros, was hoping fervently for the chance to play 
with Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings expect Storr in training camp, but McMaster says the young goalie 
will determine what happens after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make sure you know this, we have two good goaltenders in Robb 
Stauber and Kelly Hrudey. We are not going to rush Jamie Storr. I think the 
worst thing you can do is rush a goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 Hrudey, 33, is going into his option year and seeks a raise. Stauber has been 
unsteady and there are questions about his durability over a full season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (Storr, 18) can be a No. 1 goalie at 23 or 24," McMaster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings also were able to fulfill their other big need, for a big forward, 
taking 6-foot-5, 225-pound Matt Johnson in the second round with the 33rd pick 
overall. Johnson, who looks at least as big as he is listed, played with 
Peterborough in the OHL and knows McMaster and Storr well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks used their second-round pick, the 28th overall, on Swedish forward 
Johan Davidsson, a slender but still growing 6-footer whose skills are skating 
and playmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Park, a South Korea native who lives in Rancho Palos Verdes and has 
played for the Belleville Bulls of the OHL since 1992, was taken by Pittsburgh 
in the second round with the 50th pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The draft concludes today with rounds 3-11. . . . In Tuesday morning's 
supplemental draft involving older undrafted players with college experience, 
the Ducks took Steve Rucchin, a 6-foot-3, 210-pound center from Western Ontario 
and the Kings took Quinn Fair, a 6-1, 210-pound defenseman who is transferring 
to Bowling Green after Kent dropped its program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have joined the Pittsburgh Penguins in a working agreement with 
Russia's Central Red Army team, which once was among the best hockey teams in 
the world but fell on hard times after the dismantling of the Soviet sports 
machine. Disney Sports Enterprises, which owns the Ducks, has purchased an 
interest in Penguins Army Ltd. as part of a three-way working agreement that 
will include player development but also emphasize marketing. The Penguins 
joined efforts with Red Army last year in an historical deal, and the team has 
since competed as the Russian Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Ducks involved, Disney will help design a new logo to somehow 
incorporate the three traditions -- and also will be involved in selling team 
merchandise and spreading the Duck logo into Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jack Ferreira said it is possible some young North American 
players will play in Russia, but only if they choose to. He is more likely to 
seek to assign some of the team's young Russians to play under legendary Coach 
Viktor Tikhonov. He also emphasized the scouting advantage of the arrangement.

MIKE DOWNEY: BY MONDAY, WE SHOULD BE ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Because I wish to pay tribute to those successful boys from Brazil, today I 
will address our U.S. soccer players strictly by their first names. For 
example, in our Independence Day battle against the Brazilians up there in the 
far-north Sao Paolo suburb of Palo Alto, I am expecting outstanding 
performances from our hungry young team, particularly from Marcelo, Tony, Ernie 
and Tab. 
</P>
<P>
 For a fast minute there Tuesday, it sure did look as though we might be 
playing Sweden instead, but, alas, even with our American boys sending along 
our very best wishes -- sweets to the Swedes -- it was not enough to maintain a 
1-0 advantage over Bebeto, Romario, Dunga, Rai and friends. Too bad, too, 
because Sweden is a team we could take, one of those weaker soccer nations like 
Costa Rica or, oh, you know, England. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Bora Milutinovic, the U.S. coach with the sheep dog bangs and the 
scuba-mask eyeglasses, is sitting here right in front of me between practice 
sessions, swearing that this is Mission Viejo, not Mission Impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil is Brazil," Bora is saying. "But, in one game, everything is 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating the phrase, "I am so happy," like a mantra, Bora -- better use his 
first name, too, mainly so I can stop looking up the spelling -- also says he 
is still attempting to ascertain why so many seemed so unhappy with the outcome 
of Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Romania at the Rose Bowl, inasmuch as: "To lose, 1-0, 
is like tie for us." (Translated: Good enough to proceed to Round 2.) 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sorry, Bora, I find myself saying to him, but it's just that we have 
become so accustomed to winning our big soccer games here in America now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where you from?" Bora says, squinting through those lenses of his. "You new 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 USA vs. Brazil is David vs. GOOOOOOOALLL-iath. We have met five times. Brazil 
has won all five. We have scored three goals against this team. Brazil has 
scored 20 goals against us. Brazil worries about us in soccer approximately the 
same way we worry about Uruguay in basketball. Brazil isn't too shook up over 
us beating Colombia. Brazil won't be shook up unless it's the 90th minute and 
the only goal of the game has been scored by Alexi or Cobi, not Romario or Rai. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Brazil is Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Back when you were coaching Costa Rica for a living, Bora is asked, before one 
of your big games against Brazil, "What would you tell your players?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bora thinks this over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ask for autographs," he answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Excellent strategy. Monday morning, be sure to write this on the U.S. team's 
chalkboard: AND REMEMBER, NO AUTOGRAPHS. Although, you must admit, at least it 
wouldn't take the Brazilian players too much effort to scribble down their 
signatures, not needing last names and all. And besides, I hear Dunga 
autographs are going for $50 apiece these days at Southern California 
memorabilia shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the surprising Swedes were not overly intimidated by the great 
Brazil team before Tuesday's contest. While watching the game on TV, the 
American players clearly took encouragement from the fact that the Brazilians 
did not look invincible. The U.S. players obviously enjoyed themselves 
immensely Tuesday, making fun of whichever teammate was being interviewed on 
ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe Sweden will beat Brazil," said one of our top players, the popular Tab. 
"Hey, it's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Sweden's players do not intimidate easily. One of them, Klas 
Ingesson, bravely playing in this World Cup even though in May his automobile 
accidentally ran into a moose. 
</P>
<P>
 And nobody is conceding anything to Brazil at this point. Germany looks quite 
strong. So does Argentina. Mexico got out of the "group of death" and is now 
listed in stable condition. Russia could surprise people if this one guy 
continues scoring goals at this nifty five-a-game clip. Oh, and naturally 
everybody has to remain aware of Italy, although occasionally I do find myself 
singing: "Where have you gone, Roberto Baggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes 
to you! You-oo-oo!" 
</P>
<P>
 As for the United States, all right, let's throw a great big Fourth of July 
barbecue with Brazil on the grill. Our fellows consider themselves ready, 
willing and able for Monday's game, particularly now that team general manager 
Bill (The Burden Stops Here) Nuttall is clear as a bell on those rules about 
how many yellow cards it takes to disqualify a player. This recent 
misunderstanding created a disturbance after the one-game banishment of one of 
America's very best players -- John.  
</P>
<P>
 Is this U.S. team better prepared to play Brazil, Bora is asked, than that old 
Costa Rica team of yours? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. My team is better team than Costa Rica." 
</P>
<P>
 Good to hear. So your team won't be asking for autographs, Bora? 
</P>
<P>
 "No. They do not know very well the Brazilian players." 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously, Bora? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says. "This is joking."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; AMERICANS ADVANCE, BUT MUST FACE BRAZIL;

FOURTH OF JULY.

 That rush of warm air felt around the Southland on Tuesday was not another 
high pressure system adding to the heat wave, but the collective exhaling of 
the U.S. World Cup team after learning it had advanced to the second round of 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to Romania on Sunday and placing third in Group A, the United 
States had to wait while a plethora of possibilities played themselves out 
before it could be sure its 1-1-1 record would send it through to the round of 
16. The team knew by mid-morning that it had made it, after the Mexico-Italy 
and Norway-Ireland games had ended in ties. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the Americans had to wait several hours to learn the identity of 
their next opponent. After settling for a 1-1 tie against Sweden on Tuesday, 
tradition-drenched Brazil will play the U.S. team on a day filled with 
symbolism in more ways than one: July 4, at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, the winner in Group B, won two of its three first-round matches and 
allowed only one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm psyched," Alexi Lalas said. "If we want to go on in the tournament, we 
have to play against the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Brazil is the favorite of many soccer experts to win the World 
Cup and that the next game might be the last for the young U.S. team. The 
Americans can take some pride in that they met their avowed goal of reaching 
the second round, for the first time since the first World Cup in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also avoided becoming the first host team to fail to 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic needed no reminding of Brazil's surplus of talent. 
When discussing the team on Tuesday, Milutinovic held up his hand when asked 
how his team would be able to counter Brazil's speed and skill, 
</P>
<P>
 "Please," he said, feigning exasperation, "You must give me a chance to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team will not have a chance to rest on its laurels. At this point in 
the tournament, everything the team does is historical for soccer in this 
country. Its tie in the first game against Switzerland gave the United States 
its first point in the World Cup since 1950, and its surprise triumph over 
Colombia was the first victory since then. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for the U.S. team is as obvious as it is enormous. Brazil is a 
giant in the sport and the United States is a tiny team with a slingshot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be prepared because mentally it's easier to prepare for a great team," 
Tab Ramos said. "You know you have your work cut out for you, it's very hard 
and you're not expected to do anything. I think that makes it easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Brazil a lot. To the people who really like soccer and who have 
watched the World Cups over the last few years, it's almost like you have a 
little part of your heart that says you want Brazil to do well because they 
play soccer so well. You want the best team to win, you've enjoyed watching 
them the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic might be facing the same problem he had when his inexperienced 
Costa Rica team played Brazil in the 1990 World Cup. What do you say to your 
players on the eve of their playing against their idols? 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them, 'Please, no ask for autographs before the game,' " Milutinovic 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There'll be no such problem with the U.S. team, Milutinovic said, because they 
don't know any of the Brazilian players. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team watched its fate unfold on television from its hotel in Dana 
Point. Milutinovic canceled practice so the team could spend more time together 
and build its "ambiance." 
</P>
<P>
 Most players evidenced a respectful optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to be in the second round is great," Lalas said. "It doesn't matter who 
we are playing. The good thing about going into the second round is that 
everything is erased. It doesn't matter where you finished because there's only 
16 teams left. We've always talked about getting to the second round because it 
doesn't matter who you are playing, and anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic has managed to imbue this team with his relentless cheerfulness. 
Even with all he knows and with his knowledge of Brazil's awesome power, 
Milutinovic was steadfast in proclaiming the United States has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one game, anything is possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold that thought.

NAVRATILOVA WINS, FACES FERNANDEZ; WOMEN: MCNEIL ADVANCES, BUT DAVENPORT LOSES 
TO MARTINEZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't like last year's Wimbledon final, when Jana Novotna could have used 
an emergency tracheotomy and a clean hankie on Centre Court, but it was close. 
That was a choke. Tuesday, there were only gagging sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Novotna lost to Martina Navratilova in the quarterfinals, 5-7, 6-0, 
6-1. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to suggest beforehand that Navratilova 
was too old and too slow to win a 10th Wimbledon singles championship. So what 
if it might have been true at the time? 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, my God, she played well," said Novotna, the No. 5 seed from the Czech 
Republic. "I can only congratulate her, and it's what I did after the match." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-seeded Navratilova advances to Thursday's semifinals, her 17th in 22 
visits to Wimbledon. She will face Gigi Fernandez, who beat Zina 
Garrison-Jackson, 6-4, 6-4. The unseeded Fernandez, best known for her doubles 
play, will make her first appearance in the singles semifinals of a Grand Slam 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing the other side of the draw is unseeded American Lori McNeil, who 
defeated Latvia's Larisa Neiland, 6-3, 6-4. McNeil will play third-seeded 
Conchita Martinez of Spain, who ended American teen-ager Lindsay Davenport's 
Wimbledon run, 6-2, 6-7 (7-4), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova began her match with a 7-1 record against Novotna, but that loss 
had occurred in last year's Wimbledon semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, it looked as if Novotna was going to produce another victory. She 
won the first set and did so by serving an ace. Navratilova, playing in her 
last Wimbledon as a singles player, looked nervous and vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sort of have to hold and get into the match and I was on my heels 
already," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was the new and improving Navratilova, not the one Novotna saw the 
week before Wimbledon, or even during her early matches at the All England Lawn 
Tennis Club. Back then, Navratilova, 37, still was making the transition from 
clay courts to grass. She was a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to slide the first two or three days and tripping and falling 
down," she said. "I looked like a fool." 
</P>
<P>
 Now look at her. Navratilova didn't lose a game in the second set and led, 
3-0, in the third before Novotna finally held serve. By then it was too late. 
Navratilova couldn't be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, the most troublesome part of the match -- not counting that 
first set -- occurred when her bangs wouldn't cooperate. So during the second 
changeover in the first set, Navratilova requested a pair of scissors. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I did a little butcher's job on my hair," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Novotna did a little butcher's job on the match. Sure, there was 
the ace to win the first set, but after that, nothing when it came to the big 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed everything by inches," she said. "I played unbelievable shots to get 
to 15-40 on Martina's serve, (but) when I had to play the big shot, I never 
made it, or when I hit it . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Then her voice trailed off, as if no more explanation were needed. She was 
right, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 As for trying to explain Navratilova's success in her 22nd Wimbledon, why 
bother? Navratilova isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is reality," she said. "This is not a dream. I'm living it." 
</P>
<P>
 The same can be said of McNeil and Fernandez. McNeil reached the semifinals of 
the 1987 U.S. Open and upset top-seeded Steffi Graf in last week's first round 
here, but that about does it for previous Grand Slam moments to remember. Not 
that she hasn't tried. McNeil holds the record for most consecutive Grand Slam 
events entered, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, McNeil arrived in Europe weeks and weeks ahead of time, 
then couldn't wait to catch the next plane back to the States. That was before 
her attitude adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this time I came over and I had a different outlook coming into 
Wimbledon," she said. "I didn't put so many expectations on myself and I just 
came over a lot later to Europe. So that's helped a lot. I'm not ready to go 
home yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is Fernandez, who suffered a pulled hamstring late in her match 
against Garrison-Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the last match was my quad(riceps)," she said. "My legs are taking a 
beating." 
</P>
<P>
 So are her opponents, to say nothing of her reputation as a doubles 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doubles is very important to me," said Fernandez, who along with Natasha 
Zvereva has already won the French Open and Australian Open this season. "It's 
more important than singles, actually." 
</P>
<P>
 Now she faces her good friend Navratilova. Both live in Aspen, Colo., and 
often train together. And until Tuesday, Fernandez was pulling for Navratilova 
to win that 10th singles title. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I have to play her, so I have to kind of forget about all that for a 
match," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimbledon Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth-seeded Lindsay Davenport of Murrieta Valley High met reporters after her 
singles defeat by Conchita Martinez on Centre Court. "I was struggling just 
keeping balls in," Davenport said of the early going. "I'm starting, like, 'I'm 
going to get killed on Centre Court.' " She recovered in time to win the second 
set, before falling in the third, 6-3. Martinez has made her second consecutive 
Wimbledon semifinal and Davenport goes home. But not without making a 
prediction on the women's singles: Navratilova. . . . Lori McNeil is 2-1 vs. 
Martinez.

CLIPPERS; CAL'S MURRAY EXPECTED TO BE CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have had as little success in the NBA draft as on the court 
-- first-round picks have included Benoit Benjamin, Danny Ferry and Bo Kimble 
-- hope to fare better with their two first-round selections today. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a trade, the Clippers probably will select Lamond Murray, a 6-foot-7 
forward from California. After averaging 24.3 points to lead the Pacific 10 
Conference last season, Murray decided to leave Cal after his junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who averaged 19.2 points in his three-year college career en route to 
setting a school scoring record, would seem to be a good fit for the Clippers, 
who probably will not be able to re-sign free-agent forward Dominique Wilkins 
and free-agent guard Ron Harper, their leading scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who idolizes Wilkins, has said he would like to play in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have the seventh and 25th picks, are reportedly considering 
trading disgruntled guard Mark Jackson and their lottery pick to Washington for 
the Bullets' No. 5 pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers say they have tried to move up in the draft but have been unable 
to work out a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also a report that the Clippers might send Jackson and their lottery 
pick to the Dallas Mavericks for forward Jamal Mashburn. But Clipper spokesman 
Joe Safety said the club has not talked to the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers might select All-American swingman Cliff Rozier of Louisville 
with their second first-round pick, which was acquired from the Atlanta Hawks 
in the Danny Manning-Wilkins trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Rozier, 6-9, averaged 18.1 points, 11.1 rebounds and 2.2 blocked shots last 
season and was the Metro Conference player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got incredible power," scout Kim Hughes of the Milwaukee Bucks said. "He 
gets any post position he wants. He just needs more offensive moves, but so did 
Shaquille O'Neal." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Rozier could slip to the second round because of a questionable work 
ethic. One NBA executive called him lazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Whomever the Clippers select, club executives probably hope he fares better 
than did Terry Dehere, their No. 1 pick last season. Dehere struggled as a 
rookie, averaging 5.3 points and shooting only 37.7%.

HANKS, 79, WINNER OF '57 INDY 500, DIES; AUTO RACING: ALHAMBRA HIGH PRODUCT 
RETIRED FROM THE EVENT IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam Hanks tried 12 times before he won the Indianapolis 500, but when he 
finally did, he pulled his car into Victory Lane, kissed his wife, Alice, took 
a swig of milk and announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1957 and Hanks was 42, the oldest 500 winner in an era when drivers 
rarely lived past 40. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday evening, two weeks shy of his 80th birthday, Hanks died of 
complications arising from a series of illnesses that have incapacitated him 
the last three years. He was at his home in Pacific Palisades with his wife at 
his side. 
</P>
<P>
 After driving George Salih's Belond Exhaust Special to victory over Jim 
Rathmann and Jimmy Bryan in that '57 500, Hanks told the cheering throng, 
"Ladies and gentlemen, I've loved every minute I've been here, but this is my 
last one."  
</P>
<P>
 No one before or since has announced his retirement before climbing out of the 
winning car. Although he retired as a driver, Hanks remained a fixture at the 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway for more than 20 years. He was director of racing 
from 1958 to 1979 and drove the pace car for six consecutive years. He also was 
director of racing for Times-sponsored races at Riverside and Ontario from 1958 
to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had almost retired the year before, when I finished second," Hanks said a 
few years ago while attending a meeting of the Speedway Oldtimers Club. "I only 
decided to run in '57 when George Salih told me he was building a new car in 
his garage in Whittier and he wanted me to drive it." 
</P>
<P>
 Salih's car had a radical design that lowered the center of gravity by placing 
the engine -- a four-cylinder Meyer-Drake Offenhauser -- on its side instead of 
in an upright position. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we arrived at Indy, the guys called me 'Horizontal Hanks,' " he 
recalled. "We were behind, like most guys were back then when the cars were 
built in a guy's garage, and missed the first day of qualifying. But once I got 
going, that little car was a beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks started 13th, but was up to fourth by the 12th lap and on lap 36 he 
passed pole-sitter Paul Russo, in a Novi, to take the lead for keeps, except 
for pit stops.  
</P>
<P>
 "The car was a real gem," he said. "It not only was lower and lighter, but it 
allowed me to see better. Salih wanted me to come back and defend my 
championship, but I'd been dreaming about winning Indy for 17 years -- ever 
since I first went there in 1940 -- so when I finally won it, I decided it was 
time to hang up my goggles for keeps." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks also finished second in 1956 and third in 1952 and 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 His career spanned both sides of World War II, in which he served as a first 
lieutenant in the Army Air Corps after learning to fly as a teen-ager. He was a 
graduate of Alhambra High. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he won the Pacific Coast championship in 1946 and the AAA 
national midget crown in 1949. His biggest victory was a 250-lap feature in the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks also drove stock cars, winning Pacific Coast titles in 1956 and 1957. He 
finished the '57 season after his retirement announcement, fulfilling a 
contract with Ford, and won at Paramount Ranch in Malibu and the L.A. County 
Fairgrounds in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most remarkable thing about my career is that I was never 
seriously injured," Hanks said. "I only flipped a car once at Indy, in 1941, 
and I was thrown clear. I was back racing three weeks later." 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held at noon on July 9 at the Best Western Airtel 
Plaza Hotel, 7277 Valjean Ave., Van Nuys, in the southwest corner of Van Nuys 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has requested that donations be made in remembrance to the USAC 
Benevolent Foundation, 4910 W. 16th St., Speedway, Ind. 46224, or to the 
Indianapolis 500 Oldtimers Club, P.O. Box 24404, Speedway, Ind., 46224.

NBA DRAFT; PICKS ARE WIDE OPEN AFTER NO. 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Big Dog and the big ducks are lined up at the top of today's NBA draft but 
after five picks, it gets treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no mystery about the top pick, with which Milwaukee will take 
Purdue's Glenn Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Kidd, Grant Hill, Donyell Marshall and Juwan Howard are expected to go 
next, to the Dallas Mavericks, Detroit Pistons, Minnesota Timberwolves and 
Washington Bullets, respectively. Even if there's a surprise, the big five 
should go to the top five drafting teams. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the players come in all shapes, sizes, ages and have games of all 
descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them, however, have about the same chances of becoming NBA stars so 
the situation is fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 The key positions are No. 7, where the Clippers were believed to be locked in 
a late debate over California's Lamond Murray and Michigan's Jalen Rose, and 
No. 8, where the Sacramento Kings are deciding between Brian Grant, a 
little-known power forward from Xavier, and Eric Montross, a more celebrated 
center from North Carolina. Mock Draft 
</P>

NBA draft will shape up: 06,05,14,20,10,05,19 No Team Player Hgt Wgt School 1.

Florida State * 02,20,49 Player Comment Glenn Robinson The closest thing to

or small forward. Donyell Marshall Forget his shaky NCAA tournament. Juwan 
Howard They love his attitude. Sharone Wright Completes their front line. Jalen 
Rose Surges at the wire to nip Lamond Murray. Brian Grant A close decision over 
Eric Montross. Eric Montross Not merely another Greg Dreiling. Lamond Murray 
The shooter they have been looking for. Eddie Jones They wanted to trade the 
pick to Detroit for Sean Elliott. Khalid Reeves Heat undecided about signing 
Brian Shaw. Wesley Person They wanted a point guard but will settle for outside 
shooter. Eric Piatkowski He made a big-time showing at the Phoenix camp. Yinka 
Dare Might have a chance in future of standing upto Shaq. Eric Mobley Big man 
drops in Don Nelson's lap. Aaron McKie Might be better than college teammate 
Jones. Jim McIlvaine A shot-blocker with no offense. Carlos Rogers Unpolished 
but athletic. B.J. Tyler Attended Coach-GM John Lucas' clinic for a drinking 
problem. Greg Minor An all-star at draft camps. Howard Eisley They take him 
over Charlie Ward. Tony Dumas No relation to Richard, they hope. Monty Williams 
If heart is OK, he's a steal here. Voshon Lenard Another shooter? Dontonio 
Wingfield A "What have we got to lose?" selection. Charlie Ward They need a 
grown-up backup point guard. On the bubble: Cliff Rozier, Louisville, an 
athletic 6-10 260-pounder who was in the lottery until he moped through the 
NCAA tournament; Dickie Simpkins and Michael Smith, Providence, and Gaylon 
Nickerson, Northwestern Oklahoma State, who is either this spring's Latrell 
Sprewell or Lamont Strothers.

METS GOODEN SUSPENDED FOR DRUG VIOLATION; BASEBALL: FAILURE TO LIVE WITHIN 
REQUIREMENTS OF HIS AFTER-CARE PROGRAM COSTS HIM 60 DAYS IN FINAL SEASON OF HIS 
CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HERRMANN, NEWSDAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dwight Gooden has long been considered the heart and the ace of the Mets, 
above their problems despite those of his own. That all might have ended 
Tuesday, and with it his career with the franchise he helped turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden was suspended without pay for 60 days by Major League Baseball for 
violating his after-care program, seven years after he tested positive for 
cocaine use and underwent rehabilitation. The ruling rocked the organization, 
which heard about an investigation 10 days ago. Given that Gooden's contract is 
up this year, he might have pitched his last game as a Met, 10 years after he 
lifted the club from its doldrums with a strong, 19-year-old right arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been suspended for breaking the rules of my after-care program. I'm 
truly sorry it happened," Gooden said in a statement released by the Mets. "I 
want to apologize to the club, my teammates, and the people of New York City. I 
want to thank everyone for their past support. I will be back stronger and 
better. I want to earn your respect back." 
</P>
<P>
 That could be the most difficult assignment of his life, considering the 
decision handed down by Bud Selig, chairman of the Major League Executive 
Council. The directive did not say what Gooden had done. His nephew and close 
confidant Gary Sheffield of the Florida Marlins implied Gooden merely had 
missed one (or some) of the random tests he has been given the past seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I knew it was not drugs, it made everything OK," Sheffield told 
reporters in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 But in its Wednesday editions, the New York Times reported a highly placed 
person in major league baseball said Gooden failed two random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the violation are to remain confidential, the Mets said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden's violation left many people feeling let down. Among those was General 
Manager Joe McIlvaine, who recalled Gooden as a high school pitcher in Tampa 
and who stood at a news conference to announce the disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's disappointment more than anger," McIlvaine said. "A sentence has 
been passed. We have to abide by it and try to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 He vigorously rejected inquiries about Gooden's future with the Mets, even 
before they were asked. "Now is not the time to answer those questions," 
McIlvaine said in a prepared statement at the start of the news conference. But 
given that Gooden is in the final year of a three-year, $15.45 million contract 
and that the Mets had been noncommittal about re-signing him anyway, his 
chances of wearing a Mets uniform next season are cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
 His chances of making it back this year probably are less than that. "I think 
you'd have to draw your own conclusion," McIlvaine said. "The suspension 
becomes effective today, then there's an extra two months, then dot . . . dot . 
. . dot. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden was in the New York area, with agent Jim Neader, but both were 
unavailable. Gooden was aware during Monday night's game that a suspension was 
imminent, after a brief phone conversation with McIlvaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fazing him. He's handling things well," Sheffield told reporters in 
Philadelphia. "I'm sure things will be all right. As long as it's not drugs, 
everything will be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything will be vague, at least for a while. Eugene Orza, associate general 
counsel for the Major League Baseball Players Association, said he would have 
to speak with Gooden before a decision is made on whether to appeal the 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets were unsure about what Gooden's next step will be. McIlvaine said he 
did not know whether the pitcher will re-enter Smithers Alcoholism and 
Treatment Center in Manhattan, adding, "It is our understanding that the 
program will be just increased testing." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the reaction was mostly shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't know anything about that," said Ella-Mae Gooden, Dwight's mother, 
in St. Petersburg. "I really don't feel like talking right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Mets Manager Dallas Green said Gooden's violation indicated he had been 
focusing more on "I" than "we." Green made similar comments last season about 
soon-to-be-exiled Vince Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody goes their own way after a game," said John Franco, who was in a 
team meeting when McIlvaine read a statement to Mets players. "There was never 
any indication there was a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden is 3-4 with a 6.31 earned-run average in 41 1/3 innings and had the 
worst outing of his career last Friday night, allowing nine runs in 5 1/3 
innings in a 9-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; COMMENTARY; ST. PATRICK'S DAY COMES ON 
JUNE 28 THIS YEAR

<P>
 Ah, glory be. They'll be dancin' in Cork and Killarney on Tuesday night, and 
the streets of New York City will turn into the old sod. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the beer that will flow till the wee hours in the pubs on the Lower East 
Side, they poured out of Giants Stadium, some 70,000 strong, dressed in green 
and headed for celebration. Their Irish national soccer team had advanced to 
the round of 16 in the World Cup, and it mattered not that it was achieved 
through a 0-0 tie with Norway, nor that this sort of World Cup advancement had 
been achieved once before, in 1990, by Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 That's football, lads. A tie is a win when you need it to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a time for hoistin' a mug and toastin' Jack Charlton's boys. They had 
survived "the group of death," the toughest division in World Cup '94, and had 
even come out of it in second place. Sing a song of County Carlow and drink to 
the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be a happy time in New York tonight," said Charlton, the tall, 
red-faced coach who was voted the most popular man in Ireland in a recent poll 
by the Irish Press Group. He got 38% of the vote. Nobody else was even close. 
And he being an Englishman! 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be havin' a party or two and you can go join them," Charlton said as 
the number of reporters claiming Irish lineage swelled quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The faithful had swooped out of the city and into the Meadowlands in cars and 
vans that streamed Irish flags and Irish signs. Walking about them in the 
parking lots, where the wearing of the green was a way of life, they said their 
names were Hanrahan and Shaughnessy and O'Leary and O'Brien. There were three 
Kellys on Ireland's roster and 10,000 more in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like we were playing in Ireland," midfielder Ray Houghton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them were in their seats a good hour before the match began. The three 
decks of Giants Stadium were overflowing with Irish signs. No corner of the 
stadium was left unrepresented, as was no corner of Ireland: Viscount Bar Cork 
on Tour. Sligo Rovers. Bellsville Galway. Kilkenny Travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also the pubs from New York and neighboring areas represented in 
sign, as were the Hibernians of Los Angeles. Mixed in were signs more 
sociological than geographical. A personal favorite: "Our Wives Think We Are in 
Lough Derg." 
</P>
<P>
 If signage were worth goals, Ireland would have won in a romp. Final count: 
137 Irish signs, five Norwegian flags. The announced attendance was 76,323. If 
you didn't have a touch of a brogue, you were an outsider. Nobody kept 
attendance on blue eyes and black hair. Nobody had to. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a marvelous atmosphere to play a game in," said Andy Townsend, a 
midfielder for Ireland. "Imagine what would have happened here if we had scored 
a goal?" 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine what happened Tuesday night in New York City. Or at O'Donoghue's Pub 
in Dublin. Or down the street a few blocks at St. Stephen's Green, where they 
were walking arm in arm through the park and singing songs about their heroes 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
 'Twas a night when Irish eyes were smilin' and life was a tall, lukewarm pint 
of Guinness, drawn ever so nicely and turned just right for a full, creamy 
head. Then perhaps another. And maybe a round for all the lads. And another . . 
.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; LITTLE COMES OF ITALY'S GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS; GROUP E: AS SLUMBER OF THE TRADITIONAL POWER CONTINUES, FANS AND 
OBSERVERS ANTICIPATE AN EARLY DEPARTURE FOR THE AZURRI .

<P>
 On a hot and anxiety-ridden afternoon, Arrigo Sacchi strode the sideline 
Tuesday in a lime green sweat suit, the only cool thing about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi yelled. He gestured, he hectored, he pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the giant slept. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played harder because we had to. They are a better team," striker Luis 
Garcia exulted as Mexico celebrated a tie with Italy that gave it an improbable 
victory in the World Cup's so-called "group of death." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, the blue-shirted players of what -- on paper -- is one of 
the best soccer teams in the world limped dispiritedly off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very tough game," said Sacchi, who has coached Italy more in 
disappointment than in joy since 1991. "The team did all it could. It is a 
quality team and it showed it. We had more chances but couldn't put it in. It 
was a fair result." 
</P>
<P>
 Not until later would the Azurri or its coach know that Italy was a 
by-the-fingernails qualifier for the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is becoming a Calvary," muttered Antonio Matarrese, president of the 
Italian Soccer Federation. "We thought we had a team that would beat them. We 
could have won. Now, we hope there is somebody up there thinking of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Matarrese was talking about Tuesday's draw with Mexico, but equally about the 
first-round performance of a team that began the tournament as one of the 
favorites, then became a notorious underachiever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found a team that was angry, but not fatalistic," said commentator Bruno 
Pizzul, who visited the Italian locker room after the game. "It seems to be our 
destiny to suffer in this uphill Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a cool night in Rome Tuesday when the game ended, 1-1, and Italians 
greeted the result with thundering silence: block party canceled by a tying 
Mexican goal after 10 short-lived minutes of second-half euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Italy has good players but they could give more," former French soccer star 
Michel Platini said on Italian national television. "It is a good team, but not 
at the level of winning the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was the death group and all four teams ended at 1-1-1. But its other 
teams, Ireland, Norway and Mexico, are not normally among the powerhouses of 
the soccer world. Italy is. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Italy lost to Ireland and tied Mexico, wresting only a 1-0 victory over 
Norway, making its first Cup appearance since 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 In three first-round games, three-time Cup winner Italy, home of the world's 
best professional soccer league, managed only two goals -- one fewer than the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Italy had great superiority, but it didn't show," said Azeglio Vicini, who 
coached the '90 team to a third-place Cup finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team didn't work," said Italo Cucei, editor of the newspaper Corriere 
dello Sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Four points in three games is not a result anybody in Italy would have 
believed a month ago. Third, behind Mexico and Ireland, barely ahead of Norway? 
Unthinkable. Italy, as usual, came to challenge for gold against Germany, 
Argentina and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 On the verge -- before Tuesday's thumping of Cameroon by Russia -- of an early 
flight home with the likes of Greece, Bolivia and Morocco? Impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet that is what has happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played three good teams," Sacchi said. "Italy played well; held its own. 
Maybe we had some bad luck, but we deserve to pass into the next round." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the silence that hung over Italian cities Tuesday night said otherwise. 
Italy believes that it has been shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Casting about for blame, Italian commentators lamented defensive lapses, like 
the one that allowed Mexico's comeback goal, a lack of scoring punch -- and a 
coach who cannot awaken his team. 
</P>
<P>
 Striker Roberto Baggio, ballyhooed as one of the tournament's best, has failed 
to score -- and failed to impress. The winning goal against Norway was scored 
when he was off the field and Italy was playing a man short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baggio is physically tired and mentally tired," observed Marco Tardelli, who 
scored in the '82 final. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio has been troubled with an aching Achilles' tendon. As he left the 
stadium Tuesday, he walked gingerly, wearing his shoes as if they were 
slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take a miracle now to save Sacchi's job. He won with AC Milan, and 
based the current national team on players he coached there after having tried 
more than 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi is both a rebel and a pioneer, believing that defensemen should push up 
and midfielders hunt in packs as catalysts of a fast, aggressive game that has 
so far failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hoped to win today, but we are not disillusioned," Sacchi said. 
"Perhaps there was a little confusion. Perhaps we should have moved around more 
without the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. And perhaps Sacchi's plans will not bear fruit in USA '94. Some of 
the world's savviest soccer writers were calling their families back in Italy 
Tuesday night, saying they expect to be home next week.

IMPATIENCE FUELS MOSLEY'S DRIVE TO RULE IN THE RING; HANDLERS KEEP HIM FROM 
GETTING AHEAD OF HIS TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question was simple and direct: "How good do you want to be?" 
</P>
<P>
 And the reply shot out of 22-year-old (Sugar) Shane Mosley's mouth as quickly 
and confidently as his left jab strikes an opponent's chin. "I want to go down 
in history as the greatest," Mosley said. "I've been boxing for a long time and 
I think I have the ability to do that. I think all it is is hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 He might be right. Someone appears to have already taken care of the talent 
part for Mosley, who started boxing in his hometown of Pomona at age 8. In more 
than 300 amateur fights, he lost only five times. In his first 11 professional 
fights, Mosley has 11 victories and 10 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
 So when he answers a question about his boxing future, boldly and decisively, 
no one around him laughs. Patrick Ortiz, his promoter, and Jack Mosley, his 
father, trainer and manager, know better. 
</P>
<P>
 The question actually seems to be when Mosley will be world lightweight 
champion, not if he will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the moment I turned pro, I wanted to get there as soon as possible, as 
fast as I as I could, however long that took," said Mosley, who acquired his 
nickname because of his likeness in looks and boxing style to Sugar Ray 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz doesn't think it will take long. Any time he gets the chance, Ortiz 
tells you Mosley could be fighting for a title within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could move faster, Shane would move faster," said Ortiz, who has had 
some trouble getting opponents for Mosley since taking over his career more 
than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Bryant, Thursday night's opponent in the Irvine Marriott's 10-round 
main event, was the third choice of Ortiz and Jack Mosley. Angelo Nunez told 
matchmaker Jerry Bilderrain he wasn't ready for Mosley, and Jose Caba 
mysteriously disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, a 29-year-old from Las Vegas, is 12-2 with three knockouts and is 
expected to give Mosley his first real test as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, Mosley will be tested Thursday," Bilderrain said. "(Bryant) is a 
brawler. Mosley has got to step up a level. You can't be overly protective with 
a fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 But Abel Sanchez, who trained world junior middleweight Terry Norris, said 
it's better to be overly protective than overly permissive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mosley's an immense talent, I just hope they don't rush him," said Sanchez, 
who compares Mosley's smooth boxer-slugger style to that of Norris. "Managers 
have to let fighters develop so they can fight at their full potential." 
</P>
<P>
 And Sanchez, who saw Mosley win a 10-round decision over Oscar Lopez on March 
26 in Pomona, doesn't think Mosley has reached his potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shane handled Lopez a lot better than I thought he would," Sanchez said. 
"Lopez is a really awkward guy and Shane just toyed with him, but I didn't 
think he's ready yet. All these kids want to be up there on TV making the big 
money. (Oscar) De La Hoya, (Larry) Donald, Shane -- give these kids seasoning 
and then put them in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shane could be ready to fight for a title now. But what if they give him a 
year to season, he could be so much better. The fighter is always going to want 
to fight for a title. The people behind him have to know better." 
</P>
<P>
 If it were up to Mosley, he'd be fighting for a world title today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel if I get in there with anybody, I wouldn't be overmatched," Mosley 
said. "I'm good enough to fight anybody because I've been boxing for so long. 
I've got a lot of experience, more than most pros. (Boxing) is just like a walk 
in the park for me. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . I'm anxious to get in the ring with the best of them, because I want to 
be the greatest. And to be the greatest, you have to fight the best. I'm not 
looking for anybody in particular, anybody that's in my way that has a world 
title." 
</P>
<P>
 The names that are most often mentioned are World Boxing Council champion 
Miguel Angel Gonzalez of Mexico (32-0) and International Boxing Federation 
champion Rafael Ruelas of Van Nuys (41-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Since turning pro in February 1993, Mosley has worked his way into the world 
rankings at 20th by the WBC, and the national rankings at No. 8 in the U.S. 
Boxing Assn. Ring magazine rates Mosley as the ninth-best lightweight in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Sanchez contends that rankings can be deceiving. He says Mosley should 
worry more about maturing in the ring than moving up the ranking ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "De La Hoya is fighting Jorge Paez," Sanchez said. "That will be a good fight 
for (De La Hoya). He'll teach Oscar a lot. Shane needs to be fighting the Greg 
Haugens, the Tony Lopezes, guys that teach you some things in the ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley is taught new tricks nearly every day from his sparring partner, Zach 
Padilla, the World Boxing Organization's junior welterweight champion. Padilla 
is impressed with Mosley's work habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can be a world champion if he plays his cards right," Padilla said. "He 
wants it bad enough. That's why he'll do it. He's in the gym more than I am. 
He's always in shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Goossen, vice president of Bob Arum's Top Rank Boxing, has been watching 
Mosley and he likes what he sees. Mosley will be on the undercard of Top Rank's 
July 24 Olympic Auditorium card, which features Padilla against Juan La Porte. 
The bout will be televised by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen said television exposure is exactly what Mosley needs at this stage of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder and harder to get fighters exposure, money and work," Goossen 
said. "The day of the mom-and-pop operation is virtually extinct. The problem 
is you need exposure to make money, and there's only a handful of promoters who 
can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz is aware that Goossen can give Mosley something he can't: Exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're flexible to work with other promoters," Ortiz said. "I don't mind 
co-promoting with Arum or (Don) King. I don't rule out any situation with them. 
If it means getting Shane in position to fight for a world title, I think 
that's what we'll do." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley said he will concentrate on boxing and let Ortiz and his father take 
care of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys know what's best for me," he said. "I'll do what they say." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley said he has been taking his father's advice since he first stepped in 
the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always watching my back and he gives me honest advice," Mosley said. 
"He's not going to tell me a lie so I can feel good. I'm going to get the truth 
because he loves me. He's hard on me, but at the same time he's just showing 
his love for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said father-son boxing relationships can work well or they can be 
disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the father's doing all the talking, the dealing, that's trouble," Sanchez 
said. "The father has to treat him like a grown man, step aside and let him be 
the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Mosley doesn't have a problem with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always told Shane that everything I have is his," said the elder Mosley, 
a former amateur boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 What Jack Mosley has is a rising young star, who has always known what he 
wants and has never been afraid to say it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was younger, I really never even looked at the Olympics," Shane Mosley 
said. "I always looked at being a world champion. I thought, 'Sugar Ray 
Leonard, Muhammad Ali -- they were professionals and they were world 
champions.' "

MIKE PENNER: MIGHTY DUCKS AVOID DRAFTING AGENTS OF FORTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And with their first pick in the 1994 National Hockey League draft, the Mighty 
Ducks of Anaheim select Don Meehan, passing over Michael Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
 There you have it: With a chance to immediately impact the lowest-scoring 
offense in the Western Conference by drafting net-finder deluxe Radek Bonk, the 
Ducks wound up taking instead another European defenseman with an eye chart for 
a last name -- and Meehan and Barnett are the primary reasons why. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan and Barnett are player agents. Need I say more? The only personas more 
non grata around the office of Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira are the San 
Jose Sharks -- and all the Sharks did was fire Ferreira two years ago and then 
sweep Ferreira's Ducks in the teams' first six meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Player agents are the pains in the wallet who keep on giving . . . and taking 
. . . and asking for more. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Paul Kariya still unsigned a year after his glorious first-round 
selection and news conference fit for a president? 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a player agent, the Ducks will tell you. Agent's name is Don 
Baizley, and in the Kariya contract negotiations, he has been everything the 
Ducks would like to see in their goalies. 
</P>
<P>
 Steadfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Unyielding. 
</P>
<P>
 Like wall, to borrow a phrase from Arturs Irbe, goaltender with evil San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Baizley has been asking for something between the moon and Saturn, according 
to the Duck party line, so Kariya remains off limits in the outer limits, a 
floating unattached satellite. Reportedly, Baizley is asking $2 million for his 
client -- Nancy Kerrigan money -- but Disney has earmarked those dollars for 
far more pressing matters, such as the promotional campaign for "The Lion 
King." 
</P>
<P>
 A year old and wiser -- or is the correct term miser -- the Ducks no longer 
draft players, they draft agents, which is why Oleg Tverdovsky (represented by 
Meehan) sits with the Ducks today and Bonk (represented by Barnett) does not. 
</P>
<P>
 The scouting reports: 
</P>
<P>
 Don Meehan: Agreeable and reasonable at the negotiating table . . . Relatively 
speaking, of course . . . Represented the referees in their salary dispute with 
the league in 1993-94, brought the matter to quick and fair resolution . . . 
Represents Toronto Maple Leaf Coach Pat Burns . . . Noted for getting Burns to 
training camp on time every year . . . Not a pushover, but not Don Baizley, 
either . . . Good people skills. Can be worked with. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Barnett: High-powered hard liner who got aging thug Marty McSorley $2 
million a year for five years . . . And you thought Baizley drove a hard 
bargain . . . Also renegotiates Wayne Gretzky's contract every six weeks or so, 
continually making Gretzky the highest-paid player in hockey . . . The man 
hockey players turn to when they're ready to make the big kill . . . Detroit's 
Sergei Fedorov hired Barnett last season and annual salary jumped instantly 
from $295,000 to $2.05 million . . . Also raked in big bucks for Jaromir Jagr 
and Brett Hull . . . Red flag: When Buffalo's Alexander Mogilny was set to make 
his big financial score, Mogilny fired Meehan and replaced him with Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Ducks beware. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's NHL draft, that's precisely what they did. Bonk was there, ready 
to plop into the Ducks' laps after Florida chose Ed Jovanovski at No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the Ducks have used Bonk? 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Bonk had 42 goals and 45 assists in 76 International Hockey 
League games for Las Vegas . . . as a 17 year old. For the sake of comparison, 
Mark Messier scored one goal in his first professional season. Bonk would have 
provided an instant jolt for the Ducks' two-goals-and-a-cloud-of-ice-shavings 
nightly attack. Imagine the possibilities, with Kariya's touch passes splitting 
the defense and Bonk cranking up for the finishing stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors' net on the corner of Douglass and Katella would have had to be 
re-zoned a red-light district. 
</P>
<P>
 But an unsigned Kariya is no use to the Ducks, and neither is an unsigned 
Bonk. With rumors of Barnett prepared to demand $20 million for five years, the 
Ducks were not prepared to double their displeasure and lead the league in 
rookie holdouts. So they skated around Barnett and Bonk and made a beeline for 
Tverdovsky, whom the Ducks regard as mobile, agile, versatile and signable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited to have Oleg," team President Tony Tavares said via 
conference call from Hartford, "and we look forward to his rapid signing this 
summer so he can join us at the start of training camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Having drafted Nikolai Tsulygin in the second round last year, the Ducks 
believe they have just imported the defensive pairing that will carry them into 
the 21st century. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsulygin and Tverdovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Kind of flows off the tongue, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky has been compared to Bobby Orr by John Ferguson, chief scout for 
the Ottawa Senators, but this could be for reasons of simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, "The Next Bobby Orr" is easier on the vocal chords than "Oleg 
Tverdovsky from Krylja Sovetov." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira scales down the comparison, likening Tverdovsky to such mere but 
highly respected mortals as Sergei Zubov and Brian Leetch of the New York 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Coach Ron Wilson avoids comparisons altogether, saying he will refrain 
judgment until he watches Oleg play at least once, but is hopeful Mr. T can 
step right in and step up the Ducks' league-lagging power play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He obviously has the potential to be the quarterback on the power play," 
Wilson says. "With Paul Kariya and (Valeri) Karpov joining him, our power play 
should improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite," he quips, "of my coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 As of today, Tverdovsky joins Kariya and Karpov only on the Ducks' unsigned 
and inactive list. But he does have an agent who is known for his knack of 
closing a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 You just can't teach that, as they like to say in hockey.

 Toronto's Wendel Clark and Quebec's Mats Sundin were involved in a six-player 
blockbuster trade at the NHL draft Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto sent Clark, Sylvain Lefebvre and Landon Wilson to the Nordiques for 
Sundin, Garth Butcher and Todd Warriner. In addition, the Maple Leafs acquired 
the Nordiques' first-round draft pick -- 10th overall -- for their first pick, 
the 22nd. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto then sent the 10th pick to the Washington Capitals for center Mike 
Ridley and the 16th overall pick. The Nordiques also made another trade, 
sending Ron Sutter to the New York Islanders for Uwe Krupp. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a left wing, scored 46 goals for Toronto in 64 games last season.

WEBBER'S $74.4 MILLION DEAL DOESN'T GUARANTEE LOYALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golden State forward Chris Webber, the top pick in last year's NBA draft and 
the league's rookie of the year, has exercised a contract option that will make 
him a restricted free agent on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber's 15-year, $74.4 million contract contains a clause that allowed him to 
become a restricted free agent.After exercising the option, which was announced 
Tuesday, he may field offers from other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Under league rules, the Warriors have 15 days to match any offer and re-sign 
Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Nelson, Warriors coach and general manager, landed Webber in a stunning 
draft-day trade with the Orlando Magic, and the Warriors labored to squeeze his 
contract under the salary cap. Midway during the season, Webber reportedly was 
unhappy playing for Nelson, but the two patched things up and Webber averaged 
17.5 points a game and led the team in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 His agent, Bill Strickland, said it was "highly probable" Webber would re-sign 
with the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're anticipating being able to negotiate a contract based on Chris' real 
value, absent a salary cap (slot)," Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Warriors are in a position to sign him for more money than anyone else in 
the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Finnane, Warriors president, said the team wants to keep Webber, whom 
league coaches unanimously selected for the NBA all-rookie team. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's youngest player, Webber led all rookies in rebounding (9.1 per 
game), field goal percentage (.552) and blocks (164).

AFTER DUCKS PASS, KINGS BOLSTER THEIR GOAL; NHL DRAFT: STORR TAKEN WITH SEVENTH 
PICK AFTER ANAHEIM SELECTS TVERDOVSKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mighty Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira called goaltender Jamie Storr the 
surest bet to become a star of any player in Tuesday's NHL entry draft -- then 
passed over him with the No. 2 pick, helping the delighted Kings snag Storr 
with the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the old cliche -- we couldn't believe the player we wanted was 
available," said new Kings GM Sam McMaster, who rated Storr second in the draft 
behind Radek Bonk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks also passed over Bonk -- the top prospect in many eyes -- after 
Florida made defenseman Ed Jovanovski the No. 1 selection. Ferreira, with no 
tempting trade offers, used the second pick on Ukranian defenseman Oleg 
Tverdovsky -- a player he insists was their first choice all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonk fell to No. 3, where he was taken by Ottawa in a first round that didn't 
lack for surprises. The biggest was a convoluted deal in which Toronto sent 
Wendel Clark, Sylvain Lefebvre, prospect Landon Wilson and the No. 22 pick to 
Quebec for Mats Sundin, Garth Butcher, prospect Todd Warriner and the No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' selection of Tverdovsky was the first upset of the draft -- and 
marked the first time two defenseman have gone 1-2. True, the Ducks had little 
need for another goalie, even if they did consider Storr the best goalie in the 
draft in years. And though Ferreira says money didn't enter his consideration, 
club president Tony Tavares made it clear the Ducks weren't interested in 
another contract stalemate like the one they're in with Paul Kariya, last 
year's No. 4 overall. That was the prospect presented by Bonk, who starred with 
minor league Las Vegas last season at 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers ranked Tverdovsky third or fourth, but the Ducks saw it 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him play in Russia, he brought me out of my seat," said Ferreira, 
who describes Tverdovsky as a future quarterback for the Ducks' needy power 
play, though perhaps not as soon as next season. "He's the type of offensive 
defenseman that every team that wins championships has, a Sergei Zubov, a Brian 
Leetch, a Ray Bourque. I'm not comparing him to them, though, I'd never put 
that pressure on him." 
</P>
<P>
 David McNab, the Ducks' director of player personnel, said the difficulty of 
scouting Tverdovsky in Russia might explain the difference of opinions -- 
though most everyone agreed he was the top European player. Tverdovsky was 
scratched from a big tournament McNab tried to attend, and the performance that 
impressed him most was at a game where no other scouts were present. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not something I had to go back and see again," he said. "When you 
shoot the puck as well as he did -- you don't do that one day and never again. 
A pitcher doesn't throw a 95 mile-an-hour fastball one day and never do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who figured Storr would be gone by the seventh pick, got their man 
-- barely avoiding a potential fiasco by picking Brett Lindros, who reportedly 
had made it clear he didn't want to play with Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably would have taken young Lindros -- and worried about it later," 
McMaster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead he got Storr, a player he knows extremely well, having seen him play 
perhaps 100 games when he was a general manager in the Ontario Hockey League 
and Storr played for the OHL's Owen Sound team, as well as when McMaster was 
the director of operations of a championship under-17 national team Storr 
played on. Most recently, Storr was named best goaltender of the 1994 World 
Junior tournament where his Canada team won the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafting goalies at 18 is considered risky, but McMaster had no doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best," he said. "He had a .918 save percentage and his team was weak 
defensively. I was in junior hockey 18 years and never saw another like him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings plan for Storr to be in training camp, but McMaster says what 
happens after that will be determined by Storr. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (Storr, 18) can be a No. 1 goalie at 23 or 24," McMaster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings also were able to fulfill their other very big need, for a very big 
forward, taking 6-foot-5, 225-pound Matt Johnson in the second round with the 
33rd pick overall.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks used their second-round pick, the 28th overall, on Swedish forward 
Johan Davidsson, a slender 6-footer whose skills are skating and playmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The draft ends today with rounds 3-11. . . . In Tuesday morning's supplemental 
draft involving older undrafted players with college experience, the Ducks took 
center Steve Rucchin and the Kings took Quinn Fair. . . . Richard Park, from 
Rancho Palos Verdes, was taken by Pittsburgh in the second round with the 50th 
pick overall. . . . . The Mighty Ducks have joined the Pittsburgh Penguins in a 
working agreement, including player development and marketing, with Russia's 
Central Red Army team, which once was among the best hockey teams in the world 
but fell on hard times after the dismantling of the Soviet sports machine.

MOONSTRUCK BY THE WAVES; AFTER THE SUN GOES DOWN, THESE SURFERS BEAT THE HEAT, 
CROWDS BY VENTURING OUT INTO THE OCEAN AT A TIME WHEN MUCH OF THE LIGHT COMES 
FROM BELOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The moon over Malibu hangs in the sky like a bright yellow beacon, bringing 
wave riders out of the valleys and hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights of Malibu Pier glimmer and Pepperdine University twinkles on the 
hill. Headlights of cars on Pacific Coast Highway carve tunnels in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Moon Patrol at Surfrider Beach is interested only in the light of the 
moon and the waves rolling in like shadows in the night. It's that time of the 
month, full-moon time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come out every full moon," says Bill Arthur, 20, a surfboard 
builder-repairman from Agoura Hills. "You don't beat the crowds anymore, but 
you beat most of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Adams, 37, says he drove from the sweltering heat of Chatsworth to surf 
under the lunar light. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I come out here late or at night. And because the crowds tend to 
go away. Last night was outrageous. It was great. It was one of the best surf 
sessions I've had in long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams is taking a breather after riding a small wave to the beach. Twenty or 
so others are bobbing offshore, waiting for the next set. Not two hours ago 
there were hundreds bobbing in their place. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nearly 10 p.m., it's balmy and the visibility is fair. The only problem 
is that the surf that has been so good all week has dropped from a steady four 
feet to an inconsistent two to three, with only an occasional larger set. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the beach is busy as those who aren't out riding the waves are deciding 
whether it's worth it -- hoping it will get better when the tide drops. It's 
the same west of here at Leo Carillo State Beach, east at Topanga State Beach 
and at practically every point-break from here to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Night surfing, though it is nothing new, is becoming an increasingly popular 
part of the summertime surf scene, and not only because of the smaller crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something magical about it," says Pierce Flynn, 40, a longtime surfer 
and national program and communications director for the San Clemente-based 
Surfrider Foundation. "Sometimes, when there's a lot of plankton in the water, 
you leave these (phosphorescent) plankton trails when you paddle. You dive 
underwater with your eyes open and it's like a meteor shower or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing to paddle out into the small waves rolling in at Malibu, Brian 
Grossman, 29, a lifelong surfer from Santa Monica, recalls such an occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two months ago we had good solid four- to five-foot swells, a grunion run on 
the beach, an offshore wind, low tide . . . and it was a phosphorescent 
evening. So, when the white water hit, it would just turn a fluorescent blue, 
and when you paddled through the water, you'd have these blue trails coming 
across." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the light of the moon, the eyes can play tricks. In the ocean, things 
such as kelp and small fish often go bump in the night -- against the dangling 
legs of surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Adams: "A buddy and me were out at 10 one night and he comes paddling 
over and says, 'Oh man, I just had the . . . scared out of me.' I asked why and 
he goes, 'This head, this face stuck itself out of the water and I looked at it 
and it was looking right at me.' I asked what was it, and he said he couldn't 
tell. So we're sitting out there and this thing comes swimming right by us and 
it was a seal , barking like a dog. But we were pretty freaked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams tries to remain philosophical when the subject of sharks comes up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I think about it is, whenever I'm out there, if there's another guy 
out there, the shark will eat him first," he says. "Then I'm OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn has been night surfing for nearly 20 years and has never seen a shark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they've seen us, though," he says. "We're always thinking about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn belongs to a club in north San Diego County called the Night Tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take those glow-lights people use on Halloween or at concerts, and we tie 
those to our wet suits and they light us up when we go streaking down the long 
waves." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have tried coal miner-type helmets and other means of illumination to 
help them see even when there is no moon. In Huntington Beach, the bright 
lights of the pier light the sea from sunset to sundown, so surfers can stay 
out all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others say they need no light -- pier, lunar or otherwise, to catch a 
wave or two after the sun goes down. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to adjust your eyes," Grossman says. "You don't want to look at 
the lights on the pier, and you don't want to look to the lights on the 
mountains. You've got to really stare out into the blackness and really focus. 
A lot of it is instinct -- you feel the pulsing of the ocean and sometimes, 
when you take off on waves, you're taking off in the last moments that it's 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards certainly don't endorse such practices, nor do they endorse night 
surfing in general, although many of them do it. 
</P>
<P>
 John Baker, a senior Los Angeles County lifeguard at Zuma Beach, says that 
although there are far more serious injuries reported during the day, when the 
less-experienced venture out into the surf, the risk of injury at night is 
significant because of the reduced visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the type of injury we usually find is a laceration, or someone being hit 
by another board or by his own board," he says. "It's not usually something 
that sends them to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Ching, a lifeguard at Huntington Beach, says serious injuries among the 
nighttime crowd at the pier are also rare, for the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guys that do it are pretty experienced," he says. "The only real 
danger out there is the pier itself, because they have to surf so close to it 
to stay under the lights." 
</P>
<P>
 It's pushing midnight now at Malibu, and many of the surfers have moved from 
first point 100 or so yards north to third point, where the waves are breaking 
cleaner and more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur, Roman Sawelenko and Mike Narchi, have decided the waves aren't good 
enough at first, second or third point and have gone home. Grossman has 
completed his session and says night surfing is always pleasant, despite the 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be alone with your thoughts, and stare out into the blackness, 
this is the way to do it," he says.

SCYPHERS' JOB FOR NEXT SEASON STILL UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Scyphers' baseball coaching career remains in limbo after the Simi Valley 
Unified School District board on Tuesday failed to vote on his rehiring as Simi 
Valley High baseball coach, instead scheduling a hearing with Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he was told by Simi Valley Principal Kathryn Scroggin last week 
that she submitted a recommendation that Scyphers be rehired under several 
probationary terms, and that the board would vote on Scroggin's recommendation 
at a closed-door meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members said they could not vote on Scyphers' rehiring until a 
hearing is held with Scyphers to discuss the terms of the recommendation. The 
hearing, which will be closed to the public, has been scheduled for July 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was a misunderstanding," board member Debbie Sandland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, who led the Pioneers to national prominence during his 16 
seasons as coach, was suspended May 3 while police and the district 
investigated allegations of financial and disciplinary improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney cleared Scyphers of criminal wrongdoing 
on June 8 and his suspension was lifted the following day. Because coaches in 
the district are on one-year contracts, Scyphers still needed Scroggin's and 
the board's approval to return to his job next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, Scroggin provided her approval for his rehire, with 10 
stipulations that he maintain certain conduct, Scyphers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he requested hearings for the past month, but none were granted. 
Sue Norman, grievance chair for the Simi Educators Assn., said the board was 
following proper procedure by not having a hearing with Scyphers until they 
received Scroggin's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members would not guarantee that Scyphers' job status for next season 
would be resolved at the meeting on July 14, but they assumed it would. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's too early to tell right now," said Carla Kurachi, board 
president. "But I would imagine it would." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers came to the meeting about 2 1/2 hours after it began. He said he had 
been expecting a phone call from Leslie Crunelle, director of secondary 
education, telling him if the board had approved his rehiring. Scyphers said he 
was surprised when a reporter told him the board had not voted.

BACK PAIN FORCES WEISS TO WRITE OFF SEASON AS NET LOSS; AFTER RAPIDLY RISING IN 
NATIONAL TENNIS RANKINGS, 16-YEAR-OLD FROM CALABASAS HIGH MUST SIT OUT A YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What a cruel trick Jason Weiss' health has played on him. A year ago, Weiss 
was overpowering opponents on the tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, because of an unusual back injury, he can barely pick up a racket. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager who slammed his way to the final of the Southern California 
Sectional tournament and to a seventh-place finish in the national junior 
hard-court championships in singles last year with a powerful serve-and-volley 
attack walks stiffly and moves slowly -- fighting off pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times during the past six months Weiss, 16, has crawled out of bed in his 
Tarzana home feeling more like an old man than a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few times my back was so sore I couldn't stand up straight," he said. "I'd 
have to sit there like I'm 80 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the injury -- a stress fracture of the third and fourth vertebrae 
-- and the exact time it occurred remains a mystery. Weiss won't rule out the 
possibility that the fracture came from playing on clay courts at the Amre 
Sammakia Tennis Academy in Florida, where he trained for four months last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said the slipping and sliding might have created extra stress on his 
lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Weiss, Jason's mother, believes weightlifting is the culprit. Jason, she 
said, worked out too often. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, the injury derailed Weiss shortly after he had become one 
of the nation's elite players in the 16-and-under division. Junior Tennis 
magazine named him the nation's most improved player in boys' 16s for 1993, and 
after his strong showing in the national hard-court tournament, more than 30 
colleges -- including Stanford, Duke and Notre Dame -- started recruiting him. 
</P>
<P>
 Reebok decided to sponsor Weiss, giving him free tennis clothing, and Sammakia 
saw the makings of another Pete Sampras. The No. 1 player in the world can beat 
opponents at the net and from the base line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason was developing the ground stroke to where he would have been more 
well-rounded," Sammakia said. "He was learning to pick his shots better and 
hanging into points really well. He was already a good volleyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason's a very gifted athlete. He's in the upper echelon of the players I've 
worked with -- and I've worked with 12 national champions. He hits everything 
on the run well. He hits the forehand on the run as good as anybody I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Sammakia said he has seen many injuries in his time: sore backs, weak 
shoulders and twisted knees. But always his players have returned to the game, 
he said, so he wasn't concerned when Weiss began taking anti-inflammatory pills 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain grew progressively worse, and when Jerry Weiss caught up with her son 
in November at the Orange Bowl national tournament in Florida, she knew there 
was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "His legs would almost give out when he just walked," she said. "I knew it was 
not good. But he wouldn't default." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before Christmas, Weiss returned to California from the academy at Lake 
Mary, Fla. He re-enrolled at Calabasas High -- his father lives in the 
Calabasas attendance area -- to complete his junior year, planning to play for 
a Coyote team that won a Southern Section championship earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But in January, a magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed slight 
cracks in the two vertebrae. Doctors prescribed rest and no athletic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 A specially designed exercise regimen provided some relief, but an automobile 
accident in March aggravated the injury. After his last examination, in May, 
showed the injury had worsened, all exercise was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 And so is an entire year of tennis. He missed last week's Southern California 
Sectional in Orange County where his brother Nicholas played in the 
14-and-under division. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's tournament was an important one for Jason. He upset top-seeded 
Kevin Kim of Fullerton, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5, to reach the 16s singles final against 
Camarillo's Bob Bryan, who won 7-6, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim (Weiss' doubles partner) and Bryan are currently playing international 
tournaments for the U.S. Junior National team, and Weiss' patience is growing 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This injury is (upsetting me) so bad that I'm just going to go out there and 
start playing and see what happens," he said. "I don't care who I lose to or 
beat. I just want to play again." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss realizes he can't follow through on that vow. Tennis is out of the 
question right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dangerous injury," he said, regaining his composure. "Your back's your 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss did go on the court recently and rallied with his brother until his 
mother caught him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed the racquet out of his hand," Jerry Weiss said. "He's getting real 
frustrated. He's concerned about college. He tries to minimize it when he talks 
to college coaches. He's trying to push himself. But he still wakes up in the 
morning and can barely move. He's in the Jacuzzi all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss plans to take five recruiting trips this fall and would like to show 
people what he can do with a racket during those visits. But his back continues 
to show what he can't do. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking down a set of stairs recently, Weiss misjudged a step. The rough 
landing jarred his spine and he screamed, frightening his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss is rarely seen at the Calabasas Park Tennis Club, where he and many of 
his friends normally practice. When he does visit, he finds watching others too 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of weird," he said. "I come to the tennis club now just to drop my 
brother off. I used to be here every day playing. It hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, if it hadn't been for another serious injury, Weiss might 
never have started tennis. While pitching in a youth baseball game, he was 
struck in the head by a line drive and suffered skull fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a dream the night before that he was going to get hit, only he was the 
batter in the dream," Jerry Weiss said. "And the boy who hit the line drive was 
the pitcher. It was a bizarre thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The injury prohibited Weiss from participating in most sports for a year. 
Reluctantly, he took up tennis at age 12 and performed as if he had been born 
with a racket in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered his first junior tournament in December. By April, he had earned a 
berth in the national 12-and-under tournament. By year's end, Weiss was ranked 
No. 11 by the Southern California Tennis Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, in 1992, Weiss reached the final of the City Section 
individual championship as a freshman playing for Taft High, losing to Rafael 
Huerta of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss led Taft to the team championship that year but also caused the team to 
forfeit that title. The same day Taft defeated University for the team 
championship, Weiss played in a national tournament in the morning in San 
Diego. He had not attended school the same day he competed in an athletic 
event, a violation of City rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was his last mishap until the injury. No one knows for sure when he 
will be completely healed, said Weiss, because tests often show "hot spots" as 
much as a year after the bone has mended. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, my whole year's gone," he said. "Can't play nationals. Can't play 
any of the clay-court tournaments over the summer. But I'd rather have my back 
better than anything right now." 
</P>
<P>
 When Weiss does pick up a racket again, it won't take him long to return to 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll get right back into it," Sammakia said. "He's that kind of athlete."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: UNSPOKEN ACCEPTANCE OF VIOLENCE; EVEN CRIMES WITH NO APPARENT 
CONNECTION TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN TURN OUT TO BE ROOTED IN A MAN'S INABILITY 
TO HANDLE THE DISINTEGRATION OF A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What do advocates for battered women mean when they tell us that our society 
has a high tolerance for domestic violence? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, don't the cops come when they're called? 
</P>
<P>
 And look at the 1989 incident involving O.J. and Nicole Brown Simpson. Didn't 
the police -- persuaded by Nicole's terror and bruises -- arrest O.J., even 
after he told them not to meddle in a "family matter"? 
</P>
<P>
 When the experts say we tolerate domestic violence, they aren't usually 
talking about the severe battering incidents that result in crutches and 
stitches, police reports and jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 What they are talking about is a culture that does not perceive incidents of 
abuse as part of an escalating pattern of violence. They are talking about a 
culture that does not see the connection between men who isolate their wives 
from friends and family, men who shower their wives with emotional abuse and 
men who batter their wives to death when they call the relationship quits. 
</P>
<P>
 When talk turns to our cultural acceptance of physical violence visited upon 
women by men they love, I often think of the time in 1991 that Sean Connery 
told Barbara Walters on network TV that he could imagine smacking his wife. And 
how, in 1993, he told Vanity Fair that his remarks had been taken out of 
context: "I was really saying that to slap a woman was not the cruelest thing 
you can do. . . . It's much more cruel to psychologically damage somebody. 
Sometimes there are women who take it to the wire. That's what they're looking 
for, the ultimate confrontation -- they want a smack." 
</P>
<P>
 And I think, too, of the Rolling Stones album "Black and Blue," which was 
promoted with a huge billboard of a bound and bruised woman and was supposed to 
be interpreted as a tongue-in-cheek image. 
</P>
<P>
 The mere fact that a renowned actor and one of the world's biggest rock groups 
can take such casual approaches to the issue speaks volumes about our tolerance 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although we'd like to deny it, family violence is a plague on all our houses. 
It seeps like spilled blood out from under closed doors and stains everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Even crimes with no apparent connection to domestic violence can turn out to 
be rooted in a man's inability to handle the disintegration of a romantic 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1990, you may recall, a New York man named Julio Gonzales had 
a fight with his ex-girlfriend. When he decided to wreak his revenge, she 
happened to be at work checking coats at the Happy Land Social Club in the 
Bronx. Gonzales doused the club's front door with a dollar's worth of gasoline, 
then put a match to it. His ex-girlfriend survived, but 87 others perished in 
the blaze. "I knew I was going to damage," Gonzales said, "but not of that 
intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 His crime was characterized as the work of an arsonist, but think about it: 
The worst incident of mass murder in U.S. history had its origins in a man's 
desire to take revenge for a soured relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about the extraordinary turmoil unleashed in Boston in 1989 after 
Charles Stuart, who was white, claimed his pregnant wife, Carol, had been shot 
and killed by a stranger who was black? The city anguished over Stuart's 
accusation, which set off a manhunt in the African American neighborhood where 
the shooting took place. A prime suspect was publicly identified. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it turned out the suspect was innocent. Carol Stuart had been 
killed by her husband, who jumped off a bridge to his death when it became 
clear the police were on to his hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 An entire city, you might say, was victimized by a man's violence toward his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I once interviewed a cultural anthropologist who was working on a book 
comparing wife-beating practices in 14 rural and non-industrialized societies. 
</P>
<P>
 She mentioned a 1985 survey on American attitudes toward wife beating, in 
which most respondents said wife beating was acceptable or at least 
understandable under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The question the anthropologist sought to answer in her book was why some 
societies tolerate battering while others do not. And what she discovered was 
that it depended on two things: how a society makes its disapproval known, and 
whether women have sanctuaries available. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a hard concept to grasp. After all, family violence experts often 
talk about what the notion of "zero tolerance" has done to the smoking and 
drunken-driving rates. 
</P>
<P>
 I often smile when I think of a story the anthropologist told me about the 
Wape, inhabitants of a Pacific island near New Guinea. They show no tolerance 
for wife beating. If the women of a village hear a man beating his wife, or 
even what sounds like an altercation, she said, they come and stand around the 
house until the wife comes out. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't it be great one day to see that happen here?

THE WORLD ACCORDING TO LISA JONES; LITERATURE: THE ESSAYIST WRITES ABOUT A 
PLACE WHERE HAIR EXPLAINS HISTORY AND ANY WOMAN WITH LIP AND NERVE CAN BE A 
'BULLETPROOF DIVA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERI NANA-AMA DANQUAH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And what exactly is a bulletproof diva?  
</P>
<P>
 A model Republican law professor who went toe to toe with a future Supreme 
Court justice? 
</P>
<P>
 A quintessential prima donna a la South-Central or Detroit, deep-diaphragming 
like, or maybe even better than, Pavarotti? 
</P>
<P>
 Or an award-winning writer who denounces any and all bi- or multiracial labels 
because she knows "that cultural pluralism (is) more than a performance piece 
for well-heeled art patrons?" 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, they represent distinct facets of a conceptual creature viewed 
from many angles in essayist Lisa Jones' "Bulletproof Diva: Tales of Race, Sex 
and Hair" (Doubleday, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they populate Lisa Jones' America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ain't as airbrushed as a Benetton ad, but it's a happening place," Jones 
writes in her introduction.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a place of blackness. A space where the political and the personal meet 
with style. Where the rooms are crowded with wit and vernacular from the League 
of Ivy and the nation of Brooklyn. A menagerie of African Americans "whose 
sense of dignity and self cannot be denied." 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately, it is a photo album filled with words, tales of the world 
according to Lisa Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what happens when black nationalist writer Amiri Baraka/LeRoi Jones 
and Jewish writer Hettie Jones have a baby. It was early 1957 in Greenwich 
Village when a young LeRoi Jones walked into the offices of Record Changer 
magazine to interview with then-22-year-old Hettie Cohen for a vacant position. 
The two fell in love, married and had children: Kellie and Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage dissolved. Hettie, who had been disowned by all but one member of 
her white family for marrying a black man, decided to raise her daughters to be 
whole, without fissures or fractures. That meant some weekends with Dad and 
some summers with Grandma. That meant leading them into the waiting embrace of 
black America, with all its pains and all its pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview during a recent Los Angeles trip, Jones recalled her 
childhood: "(My mother) taught us a respect for difference, that difference in 
the context of a family is something to be enjoyed, appreciated and discussed. 
. . . I grew up thinking that I was a part of a very healthy American family 
and it has always amazed me when people respond to it as if it is an oddity." 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of crediting her mother for instilling in her a strong 
sense of pride and individuality as a black woman, Jones does not linger in 
public conversations about her parents. As a feminist intellectual of color, 
the shadows she will box are many but perhaps the largest one is that of her 
parents' successes as writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Born of famed writers, armed with an undergraduate degree from Yale and a 
graduate degree in film from NYU, this diva faces a general perception that she 
has never seen the likes of bullets in her path. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide-eyed observer, she is petite and perfectly charming with a smile that 
is part mischievous, part whatever she chooses at the moment, with a head full 
of long, loose-kink black hair. In conversation, as in writing, she dubs 
herself "just another butter-pecan-colored black girl."  
</P>
<P>
 But looks are deceiving. She has worked hard for all that is here. She's been 
a supermarket check-out girl, a waitress, a cookie salesperson. The list is 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 A scholarship student at Yale, she worked in the dining hall, where the "boys 
would come in with their hats, drunk as hell on Friday nights, buying their 
candy and milkshakes, throwing stuff at you and you'd be wearing your Yale hat 
and they'd still be treating you like the help." 
</P>
<P>
 While attending film school full-time, she juggled writing books with Spike 
Lee, working as an editor at the Village Voice and free-lancing for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, composed mainly of essays from Jones' Village Voice column "Skin 
Trade," reads like an autobiography. It is hard to separate the woman from her 
work. She profiles many people: her favorite aunt, Cora; Tony Smith and Carmen 
Montalvo, owners of Tompkins Square Video; filmmaker Julie Dash; comic strip 
artist Barbara Brandon; fine-art photographer Coreen Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems she presents these people as mere dimensions of herself. They are her 
heroes. When Jones was young, a colleague advised her to go with her 
obsessions. She followed that advice and -- true to the subtitle of the book -- 
writes primarily about race, sex and hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although last on the line-up, hair is the string that weaves together her 
issues of race and sex. Jones writes: "Everything I know about American history 
I learned from looking at black people's hair. It's the perfect metaphor for 
the African experiment here: the price of the ticket (for a journey no one 
elected to take), the toll of slavery, and the costs of remaining. It's all in 
the hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Always with that mantra in mind, Jones reigns supreme as a cultural critic. 
She places herself alongside those at the forefront of an ongoing dialogue of 
African American writers, such as Cornel West, Michelle Wallace, bell hooks and 
Greg Tate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones mixes her humor with irony, sparing no one -- least of all herself -- 
from the candor of her observations. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Looking for Mariah," she tackles another obsession -- consumer identity. 
"By marketing themselves as anything but black, do light-complexioned 
entertainers such as (Mariah) Carey become, in the eyes of most Americans, de 
facto whites? And do Carey and other people of color who feel more at ease 
representing themselves by their combination ethnic heritage, and not by race 
(making use of the privilege to remain outside), teach the world how to be 
'raceless'? . . . The ironies of racial identity and cultural province in the 
'90s are making popular culture the best sideshow in town. . . . Rainbow baby 
girls (Mariah, Sade, Jasmine Guy) rule the mirror." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed there are ironies. One need only look at the cover of "Bulletproof 
Diva" to witness a contradiction. It boasts a smiling Jones looking all too 
much like those "rainbow baby girls" who have probably abandoned the mirror in 
search of their pots of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her attempts to place herself and her visions in the historical and 
political context of black America, it is obvious that Jones falls prey to the 
very marketing strategy she condemns. 
</P>
<P>
 To that observation, she responds: "The work that I am doing is probably a lot 
easier to stomach coming from a multi-culti chick like me. . . . I think what I 
am doing in the book is critiquing some of that fascination with that image." 
</P>
<P>
 What then, if anything, does this mean? Does the fact that Jones is 
light-skinned by way of mixed race invalidate the potency and the necessity of 
her writing? Certainly it calls into question her ability to fully claim and 
write work that operates through and is informed by an African American 
experience. And she is aware of this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly don't want to be mulatto of the month. I am able to speak 
comfortably as an African American and as a person of mixed race, which is part 
of African American culture." 
</P>
<P>
 As a coda to her essay, "Tragedy Becomes Her," which addresses the dilemma of 
the mulatto, Jones writes: "How do you like me now? I could be heroine, I could 
be healer. I talk back. I refuse complicity with any of you if I can't speak 
the truth that is mine. On my body is inscribed the future. I'll keep my hands 
around your throat until you claim me. I am yours. I am yours. I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Having refused all labels that society would seek to place on her, what 
identity does Lisa Jones choose for herself? She is a collector of images. A 
woman in search of more heroines like her grandmother and her mother. Like 
Jamaica Kincaid, Toni Morrison, Buchi Emecheta and Lani Guinier (about whom she 
says: "If I could be anything other than who I am, I'd be that diva.") 
</P>
<P>
 But what exactly is a Bulletproof Diva? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to assume that a Bulletproof Diva is whoever you make her -- 
corporate girl, teen mom or the combination -- as long as she has the lip and 
nerve, and as long as she uses that lip and nerve to raise up herself and the 
world."

HIS BROTHER'S KEEPER; DAVID GLASCOCK CARES ABOUT THE PEOPLE NOBODY CARES ABOUT: 
IMPRISONED GAYS. HE'S MADE THEIR TREATMENT HIS BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They call it the Witch's Castle, this jail cell decorated with he-man posters 
and frilly toilet-paper curtains, filled with men arrayed in homemade earrings 
and with silicone breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here that gay activist David Glascock comes to visit "the Girls," who 
greet him with all the fanfare of a returning hero. 
</P>
<P>
 A rotund, balding man with a gray mustache, he makes for an unlikely 
celebrity. But little is as one might expect in Module 913, the tiny ward 
tucked away in the padlocked heart of the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, the 
Castaic jail where the county houses transvestites -- the men who would be 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 With the determined air of a drill sergeant, Glascock wades into a bevy of 
shrieking inmates, ready to hear the concerns of this subculture behind bars -- 
their bouts with the AIDS virus as well as their treatment by jailers. He is 
their advocate, their defender and, sometimes, their savior. 
</P>
<P>
 Glascock has insight into this little-known world: He is gay. And he is HIV 
positive. And he too spent time as a teen-ager in prison for a sex offense -- 
an indelible asterisk that is the extent of his criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody cares about people in jail, especially homosexuals," he says. "Last of 
all come the queens. They're one of the most isolated groups in society. They 
have no power. And they have no one with any power who's interested in their 
behalf." 
</P>
<P>
 Except Glascock. Since walking into the Central Men's Jail in Downtown 12 
years ago, curious about the treatment of fellow gays, the onetime taxicab 
dispatcher and former assistant to County Supervisor Ed Edelman has been a 
demanding prisoners' rights advocate, battling for the men he calls "my 
brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 First as a volunteer, then as a paid monitor for the American Civil Liberties 
Union, Glascock, 53, has campaigned to see that all gay men receive equal 
treatment in the Los Angeles County jail system, where since 1981 -- after 
several lawsuits -- they have been separated from other prisoners for their own 
protection. Last year, the Honor Rancho became the jail for gays arrested 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that crusade is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Glascock's $15-an-hour job has been slashed from 100 to 62 
hours a month. The ACLU, which pays him out of a special budget that it 
administers for the county, called the cutback an internal matter and stressed 
that its commitment to protecting the rights of gays will continue -- with or 
without Glascock. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the cuts concern many inmates and some jail staffers who say his 
dedication could simply not be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "David Glascock has made a difference for gay people behind bars," says a gay 
former inmate. "He works wonders in the most hellish of circumstances. And the 
jail command respects him. When David talks, they listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Most days, Glascock drives from his West Hollywood home to the distant Honor 
Rancho, north of Magic Mountain. There, in the gay ward's four 96-bed units, he 
listens to problems worsened by a military-style system with few clues about 
gay life -- the needs, fears and dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, he intervenes on behalf of sick inmates, some with AIDS, who he says 
are slow to be given drugs such as AZT or even routine medical care. He haggles 
with a sluggish bureaucracy to secure extra blankets and double portions of 
food for the sickest. Jail officials acknowledge that oversights occur and that 
Glascock has pinpointed prisoners who needed extra attention. 
</P>
<P>
 He also plays a gruff guardian angel to first-timers who dread becoming lost 
among the 20,000 inmates in the nation's largest jail system. Many fear being 
housed with the jail's general population, the domain of career criminals and 
gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Glascock walks a tightrope between the jailed and the jailers: Among the 
prisoners, he weeds out career complainers from those with serious concerns, 
sometimes inspiring criticism from the inmates. He is mistrusted by some guards 
who dislike the pampering of gay inmates by an outsider unafraid to circumvent 
jail command, even telephoning a supervisor's boss to get his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I piss everybody off," Glascock says, "at one time or another." 
</P>
<P>
 When he started this work, deputies wouldn't use the same cafeteria table as 
Glascock. They left him nasty notes, whispered about the man who had spent two 
years in a Wisconsin prison decades earlier, after a conviction for having sex 
with a 15-year-old male prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Glascock's relationship with guards has improved. He now conducts seminars for 
deputies on the intricacies of gay life. Because of his efforts, jail officials 
hand-select deputies to work in the gay ward at the Honor Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
 He also successfully pushed to transfer "homophobic" guards, including one who 
reportedly terrorized the men, destroying their personal belongings. "Some 
guards hate him," one deputy says, "because they don't understand him." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he has defended others wrongly accused of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Glascock's time is devoted to the classification of inmates based on a 
system he helped create with Deputy Ernie Cobarrubias. He evaluates the sexual 
orientation of all would-be gay inmates, weeding out straight prisoners who 
might infiltrate the gay dorms to attempt rape or extortion, or just to escape 
the jail's main population. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Senior Deputy Ken Irwin, he also tries to keep the drag queens 
out of the gay dorms. While not sexually attracted to each other, the queens 
often seek relationships with heterosexuals or other, more masculine gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Glascock has conducted more than 30,000 such interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect what David does here," says Irwin, 51. "He feels a strong 
connection to his people. I'm proud to call him my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, in a move approved by his supervisors, Irwin sent a letter seeking 
the political support of local gay leaders, calling the cutback in Glascock's 
hours "an injustice to someone who actually gives more than he could ever be 
compensated for." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, inside the gay module, there is growing concern that a voice might 
be stifled: "A lot of people call him a big, blustery so-and-so, but underneath 
it all is one big heart," inmate Randolph Higgins says. "I'm afraid to see what 
life here would be like without him." 
</P>
<P>
 In a charmless cinder-block room, the Odd Couple awaits the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Irwin and David Glascock sit like stern-faced judges presiding over some 
sexual court, sizing up the men seeking a bed in the gay module. 
</P>
<P>
 But gaining admission to the dorm is no easy feat before these two, who are 
always on the lookout for impostors -- the neo-Nazis, gang members and tough 
guys who might try to claim the cells as new turf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With studied looks -- as well as a guide book to gay bars nationwide -- they 
question each man, examining his written answers on a form with such queries 
as: "Which gay bars have you been to?" "What is your lover's telephone number?" 
"Where and when is the gay pride parade?" 
</P>
<P>
 The criterion for entry is simple: living a legitimate gay life on the street. 
It does not mean, Irwin says, having gay sex just for convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 They're a wily pair. After one long-haired inmate bluffs several correct 
answers, Glascock's eyes narrow. It is the quick studies who anger him most -- 
sullen jail veterans who lie about lovers they've had, gay bars they've visited 
-- men who would cause nothing but trouble among the gays. 
</P>
<P>
 One man once professed to be HIV positive in an attempt for sympathy. Glascock 
cleared the room. "Listen, you son of a bitch!" he spat. "You know you're not 
gay. But I am gay and I'm HIV positive. And you don't want to be me. So, don't 
ever pull that again." 
</P>
<P>
 So he goes on the attack with the long-haired man, demanding to know the 
location of the fish tank in the lobby of a West Hollywood gay bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Er, it's on the right, yeah, the right," the inmate stammers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next!" Glascock calls out. Smiling, he says the bar has no fish tank. 
</P>
<P>
 To another inmate he says, "Why should you end up here? Why shouldn't you be 
sent to the place where the Bloods and the Crips are?" 
</P>
<P>
 The man's reply: "Because I'd end up dead there." Glascock lets the man in. 
</P>
<P>
 The drag queens play a different game of deception -- scrubbing off makeup and 
nail polish, telling lies and wild stories -- all to avoid the isolation of the 
Witch's Castle, which sits on a hill overlooking the rural grounds -- inspiring 
the nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 With 60 inmates to see that day, Irwin and Glascock are not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me see your chest," Irwin barks at one man. "Do you have chi chis? OK, 
now let me see your toenails. You tried to scrape off the polish, didn't you?" 
The man is sent to the Witch's Castle. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few tough minutes, an inmate with orange hair passes muster. "Thanks a 
lot, darlin'," Glascock says, clearing him for the gay ward. "The third 
degree's over. Oh, by the way, I like the way you do your hair." 
</P>
<P>
 The system isn't foolproof -- straight inmates have slipped past the pair. 
Borderline cases are scrutinized. Some are housed in the "Softie Tank," the 
dorm for white-collar heterosexuals who might be victimized in the general 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of tension, Glascock has developed an easygoing relationship with 
Irwin -- a muscular, religious man and a reluctant newcomer to the world of 
gays behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 When gay inmates were moved to the Honor Rancho last year, Irwin, an 18-year 
veteran, was low man on the deputy supervisory ladder: He was made the 
classification officer, a job no one else wanted. Irwin had never known an 
openly gay person. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Glascock. Initially, tempers flashed with this strange, often-grumbling 
volunteer who was Irwin's guide to the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once, when I cut off some inmate, David corrected me right in front of the 
guy," Irwin recalls. "He said, 'Hey, you're not giving this man a chance to 
talk.' So I let him talk. Later, Glascock and I had a little talk of our own." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen months later, the two discuss Irwin's home life in Valencia with his 
wife and three daughters, or Glascock's in West Hollywood with his 34-year-old 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
 They exchange birthday and Christmas gifts. At the jail, it was Irwin whom 
Glascock first told about his HIV-positive status. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Glascock, Irwin has learned compassion for the transvestites: He has 
allowed impromptu "weddings" and a talent show in which inmates sang and 
danced, using toilet paper rolls for microphones and mop-heads for wigs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On regular tours of the gay ward, Irwin will sit with inmates and critique 
their drawings or tell stories with the warmth of a grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Glascock gave Irwin a tour of the West Hollywood streets where most 
drag queens are arrested. For Irwin, this was another first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look! There's Irwin!" several queens shriek as Irwin cruises past in a 
late-model Lexus, smiling broadly like a kid on a field trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," he later asks Glascock, pointing to one gay bar, "that sign says 'SM'! 
What's that stand for, like S & M?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Kenny," Glascock answers, his face wrinkled. "It stands for Santa Monica 
Boulevard, the street we're on." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a scene of two friends having fun. "Which way do I go, right or 
straight?" Irwin asks at one corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is West Hollywood, Ken," Glascock replies. "It's either right, left or 
gaily forward, but never straight." 
</P>
<P>
 At a crowded bar, the two meet several gays they had interviewed at the jail. 
Glascock introduces a suddenly reserved Irwin: "Hey, remember Ken? He's finally 
come out of the closet!" 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin's reply: "Yeah, and now I want to go back in." 
</P>
<P>
 The group laughs. Glascock pats Irwin lightly on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 In dramatic fashion, the drag queen sighs breathlessly and describes life in 
the Witch's Castle: "The witch," he says, "is always hidden away where no one 
can hear her cries." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Glascock nor the people he helps like the way the queens are housed in 
the most secure area at the Honor Rancho, alongside the most violent inmates. 
Jail officials say the 32-bed ward is the perfect size for the community, 
normally ranging from 20 to 30 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it's the treatment of the queens that most concerns Glascock. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly uneducated teen-agers who have taken to a life of street prostitution, 
the queens fall to the bottom of jail society, Glascock says. They're 
ostracized by other gays, who see them as unflattering stereotypes -- men who 
dress as and imitate women. 
</P>
<P>
 Queens moved to regular gay modules have taken on boyfriends, inciting fights. 
After lights-out, they have cruised the dorm for lovers, using ripped-up 
bedsheets as makeshift halter tops. 
</P>
<P>
 Glascock has defended such practices, describing the inmates as "women trapped 
in men's bodies." If they must be isolated, he says, allow them to go topless 
and wear makeup as a way to express their sexual identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude is, 'Dammit, these are men and they're going to be treated like 
men,' " he says. "Well, they're not men. Nobody would choose this lifestyle 
unless they had something burning inside them." 
</P>
<P>
 And so they languish in the Witch's Castle -- some awaiting trial, others 
serving time, mainly for prostitution -- dancing daily to MTV in herky-jerky 
moves, calling each other "Miss Thing" in low-pitched but oddly feminine voices 
and fighting over the smallest things: "We may look like women," one says, "but 
we fight like men." 
</P>
<P>
 Risking punishment, the queens defiantly maintain their feminine look with 
homemade makeup recipes: For mascara, they burn the black telephone receiver 
with a lighter, mixing the melted plastic with toothpaste smeared on the 
cinder-block wall. They combine soap and a breakfast ration of oatmeal to make 
beauty masks. Earrings are fashioned from the foil tops of their morning orange 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to stay beautiful," says Carlos Alvarati, a male prostitute who uses 
the name of Lizete, "even though it gets us into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Glascock has lost battles for makeup and topless inmates. But he has had his 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking inmate complaints to jail superiors, he secured a doctor to replace one 
who had taken sick. And he won the queens part-time use of a classroom where 
they can study for high school equivalency tests. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, Glascock continues to play confidante to inmates. As he watches a 
family inheritance dwindle, he wonders how long he can survive on his ACLU 
salary of $930 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But he knows that the job -- and his newfound friendship with Ken Irwin -- has 
deepened his sense of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Like during the interview when he asks which gay bars an inmate frequents. "I 
don't go to bars anymore," the man says. "I'm almost 56 years old, nobody would 
have me. Anyway, I value my life, so I just don't go." 
</P>
<P>
 Glascock studies the man in silence. "I know," he replies softly, glancing 
over at Irwin. "You get to be 50 and nobody wants you. It's tough, man, really 
tough."

'90S FAMILY; WELCOME TO 'CLUB GRANDMA'; THERE ARE ADVICE BOOKS FOR WIVES AND 
HUSBANDS, MOMS AND DADS. BUT UP UNTIL NOW, GRANDMOMS HAD TO GO IT ALONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long neglected in the voluminous library of self-help books, grandmothers now 
have a tome of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Club Grandma: Etiquette, Privi leges and Official Duties for To day's 
Grandmother," (Longmeadow Press, 1994) by Leslie Lehr Spirson, teaches 
matriarchs that learning to love being drooled on can be the greatest love of 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a book for the grandmother of the '90s who is in her 50s -- one who can 
fix the timer on the VCR but is pressing the snooze bar on her own biological 
clock. For this group, Spirson has a simple message: "You have fulfilled your 
genetic imperative by producing future generations. Hold your head high." 
</P>
<P>
 The book -- which was co-written by Spirson's mother, Claire J. Lehr, and was 
published in June -- maps grandmotherly duties from the cradle onward, 
including practical segments on long-distance bonding, how to tolerate your 
grandchild's strange haircuts (not to mention Barney) and the premise, possibly 
controversial, that kids like to hear about which relatives they look like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandmotherhood is a well-kept secret," said Lehr, 57, of Newport Beach. 
"It's also a great reward." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Spirson, 35, a Woodland Hills resident who also wrote 
1991's "Welcome to Club Mom," discussed the book and the need to plot a new 
course for grandmothers in changing times. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: There are plenty of books on motherhood, but not many on how to be a 
grandmother. Many people probably assume that it comes naturally. Why did you 
write the book? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: When I had my first baby, the relationship that really changed was 
between my mother and me. She has a Ph.D. in childhood development and soon 
became the grandmother from hell. She was always wanting to hold the baby when 
I wanted to, instead of cleaning the house, which is what I wanted her to do. I 
finally told her, "If you want to come over next week, hand the baby over right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So how did things change? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We had a serious talk. When you're the mother, you become the power person. 
The mother has to be assertive, so the grandmother must move over and become 
the queen mother. Once that was worked out, things went fine. (Lehr, who said 
the situation became a "running joke," offered a somewhat different assessment: 
"I was the grandmother from heaven and all my daughter had to do was see the 
light. One thing people of my generation know is when to step aside and defer 
to the younger generation. When they have self-esteem, they realize how 
important we are.") 
</P>
<P>
 In therapy, my mother asks her patients: "Who was it that believed in you?" In 
a great majority of instances, it was the grandmother. It is the relationship 
of unconditional love. So the potential for that relationship is very high. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the book, you emphasize the importance of tolerance -- in the early 
stages, for grandchildren's imaginary friends and, later on, strange haircuts. 
How difficult is this to accomplish? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For parents, it's hard. They worry that every little thing their child does 
will take root. Grandma has been there before and knows that it's just a stage. 
She can become like a silent confidante. You know, suddenly I'm calling her for 
advice. I guess that's how you know you're a grandma. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You also mention the importance of sex appeal. You write that grandmothers 
are caught between two stereotypes, either an old woman with blue hair in a bun 
or a sexy woman in a tennis outfit. What's a grandmother to do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think grandmothers are the sexiest women alive. Not only has she 
procreated, but her children have procreated. She's like the mother duck with 
all these little ducks trailing behind her. When you're a grandma, you're at 
the height, because all the way down the line, everyone is doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 As for external shows of sexuality, that's private. If they want to wear 
purple miniskirts like Liz Taylor, great.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is "long-distance bonding"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If the grandmother is far away, this is absolutely essential. In the early 
stages, babies sense everything with the eyes and nose. Send a scarf with a 
scent and a big picture that can hang by the cradle. Send tape recordings with 
favorite lullabies and stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, it is contact. It is really great to have a grandma who will call 
or send frog postcards in the mail. They can send their grandchildren tapes in 
envelopes marked "Top Secret," which the children can listen to on headphones 
in their room. It's like a secret club. It is someone who always roots for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You contend that grandchildren actually like to hear which relatives they 
resemble. Is this backed up by serious empirical evidence? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you have to make the grandchildren the most important thing. If they 
can imagine their parents as children or their uncle as a little boy, with the 
same features, this establishes a very important connection with their family. 
They can see pictures of their father and hear: "Look at that silly sailor 
suit." It's a way to poke fun at the boss.

'90S FAMILY; CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF YOUR NANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH LAMPERT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Ruth Lampert, a marriage, family and 
child counselor and free-lance writer, has five grandchildren. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a good grandchild was certainly easier in the old days, before there 
were so many demands on the time and energy of children. Between long hours of 
school and homework, dancing lessons, soccer games, social obligations and 
telephone time, you probably feel spread pretty thin. Besides all that, there 
are the demands of your parents, who, without intending to add to your stress, 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 The magic words of grandchilding are the same ones your parents put such trust 
in: quality time. By focusing your attention on those few areas that mean the 
most, you can raise happy, high-achieving grandparents who will have that most 
sought-after quality of the '90s: good self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The following seven tips -- widely followed and highly useful for most -- were 
formulated to help kids like you. But always remember that in the final 
analysis, no one knows your grandparents better than you, their grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
 1. What Grandparents Like to Read 
</P>
<P>
 The hands-down favorite reading material of grandparents is thank-you notes. 
These needn't be elaborate or expensive. In fact, most grandparents go 
absolutely bananas over scrawled, misspelled, hand-illustrated, jelly-smeared 
little numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial thank-you notes can be given individual touches. For example, to 
reinforce the thank-you note habit, I recently gave my daughter a printed 
thank-you note to give to her daughter, who had received what I thought was 
quite a nice birthday gift and not cheap either. The note was promptly returned 
with a personal note to the effect that she was enjoying the gift a lot, "and 
thanks for giving my Mom this card to give to me to send to you." Touches like 
that make all the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Hugs, the Miracle Ingredient 
</P>
<P>
 A grandparent deprived of at least a minimum of grandchild hugs will quickly 
develop Senior Sensory Scowling Syndrome, with symptoms such as crankiness, 
criticalness and stinginess. There are, of course, individual differences as to 
just how much hugging is required; also, for grandparents who live at a 
distance, it can be a problem. That's where cute notes and letters play an 
especially important role. 
</P>
<P>
 When I give advice to adults, I make quite a point of telling them to honor 
the child's wishes about physical demonstrativeness. It's good advice. Right 
now, though, I'm talking to you, and I say, hug 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The Power of the Unexpected 
</P>
<P>
 While birthdays, anniversaries, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Grandparent's Day, 
Special Person's Day, and all major and minor holidays should, of course, be 
promptly and lovingly acknowledged, you will really make points by sending 
little jingles to your grandparents on occasions such as the vernal equinox 
("Spring has sprung, the grass is green, I haven't seen you all week, where 
have you been?"), the autumnal equinox ("The longest day of the year is one on 
which from you I don't hear") and so forth. I know one little genius who sent 
his grandmother on the opposite coast the following poem, accompanied by a 
newspaper ad of a national chain store's Thanksgiving Weekend Sale: 
</P>
<P>
 "There are Sales in the East, There are Sales in the West, but when it comes 
to bargains in Nanas you're the best." 
</P>
<P>
 4. The Art of Creative Hinting 
</P>
<P>
 Although someone once said that children and grandparents get along so well 
because they have a common enemy -- the parents -- there is a universal adult 
loathing of whining, so forget that as a technique. Try Creative Hinting 
instead. While your parents may tumble to your true motives (perhaps even 
labeling your best efforts "manipulation"), grandparents delight in bragging to 
their friends about how clever you are.  
</P>
<P>
 Listen in on any gathering of grandparents, and you'll hear boasts such as: 
</P>
<P>
 "That grandson of mine! He thinks I didn't see right through it when he told 
me his other grandpa disapproves of stereo equipment for 10-year-olds. I was 
going to get him that for his birthday anyway. Of course I'm much younger than 
Grandpa Grizzly, so I am more understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 5. Memorable Outings 
</P>
<P>
 Grandparents' ideas of what makes for a terrific outing may be very different 
from yours. Most, although not all, grandparents are very big on things 
educational and are forever inviting you to go to museums, art shows and 
concerts (their kind, not yours). 
</P>
<P>
 Be willing to compromise. Two hours of enduring "The Boffo Beat of the Big 
Bands" or "Art From Small Town America Prior to World War II" will probably be 
followed by dinner at a really cool restaurant of your choice, with more sweets 
than your parents would permit in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Powerful Praise 
</P>
<P>
 To be powerful, praise should be administered sparingly and wisely. Comments 
such as, "I think you'd look awesome in a bikini, Grams, your tummy has a great 
curve and you should be proud of all those silvery stretch marks" won't fly. 
Contrary to what you may have heard or read, lavish and indiscriminate praise 
does not raise self-esteem in seniors any more than it does in juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 What works is well-timed and realistic recognition of true mastery and 
competence. Instead of saying something inane like "You're just the best driver 
I ever saw in my life!" which your grandparent will immediately recognize as 
phony baloney unless his/her mental state prohibits driving altogether, try 
this: When you notice him/her driving in the slow lane at only 10 m.p.h. less 
than the posted speed limit, remark sincerely, "It's sure nice driving with you 
today; hardly any cars are honking at us." 
</P>
<P>
 7. Being Effective With Electronics 
</P>
<P>
 The answering machine is one area where you have it all over previous 
generations. Use it wisely and well. Whether your message is lilting, lisping, 
giggly or semi-intelligible, your grandparents will love it, and possibly save 
the tape along with photos, thank-you notes, handprints, school pictures and 
all the other memorabilia of your childhood.  
</P>
<P>
 And believe it or not, the day will come when looking at and listening to all 
that gooey stuff will make you feel good about yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that the job of being a grandchild is difficult and demanding, so 
don't try to do it perfectly -- no one does. Your grandparents, and your 
parents, got plenty of expert advice about raising you, but hardly anyone 
besides myself has addressed the unique challenges you face. 
</P>
<P>
 When the going gets rough, keep this in mind: Thirty years from now, your 
grandparents won't be telling some therapist about all the mistakes you made.

SUPT. TO RETIRE AFTER 20 YEARS; EDUCATION: NORMAN R. BREKKE WILL LEAVE BEHIND A 
LEGACY OF FISCAL COMPETENCE AND COOLNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not far from the front door of the Oxnard School District Office, Supt. Norman 
R. Brekke sat behind his desk -- still amid the fray but gray-haired after 
leading Ventura County's largest elementary school district through the turmoil 
of forced busing and the traumas of explosive growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to make sure I was available," Brekke said of his high 
visibility at the school headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Brekke will retire after 36 years in the Oxnard district and 20 
as superintendent. At 60, he has never worked professionally for another 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dean of county school executives, he will leave behind a legacy of 
fiscal competence, coolness during crisis and innovation in year-round 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke and his wife, Betty Brekke, plan to move almost immediately to a small 
ranch near Portland, Oregon, where he will raise llamas and work part-time as a 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a change that Brekke has contemplated for years, but a wrenching one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a profound emotional experience for me to walk out the 
door," Brekke said this week. "It is going to be a very painful experience. I 
have invested my heart and my soul in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke, who says his usual work day has been 12 hours long, thinks he has done 
his part to educate children and to hold together a 13,000-student school 
district with more than its share of race-based politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Calm and self-assured but not arrogant, Brekke is widely admired by colleagues 
and past opponents alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "He deals with facts and sorts them out and produces a solution without a lot 
of personality and political interference," said Kent Patterson, an Oxnard 
assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 That same coolness under pressure was apparent in the early 1970s, when he was 
first confronted by angry Latino parents demanding more school integration, and 
then by enraged white parents who wanted the district to fight court-ordered 
busing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in an extremely difficult position," recalled attorney Thomas Malley, 
who sued the district on behalf of several Latino parents. "He conducted 
himself with integrity and reasonableness." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Juan Soria, a plaintiff in the desegregation suit, described Brekke as 
calm and clever -- defusing confrontations between the school board and angry 
residents. Soria, however, said Brekke's administrative focus may also have 
been his shortcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Soria said Brekke was too concerned with putting out administrative fires and 
too little involved in improving classroom education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke himself said he considers his response to rapid enrollment during the 
1970s as his crowning accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke had just become superintendent in 1974, when an economic crisis hit. 
Schools were full, enrollment was increasing 500 per year and the district had 
no money to build new schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were facing a crisis," Brekke said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a school bond measure failed, the school board directed Brekke to see 
how year-round education would work in Oxnard. Because they operate 12 months 
instead of nine, such schools can increase capacity up to 33%. Brekke took the 
assignment to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Within six years, every Oxnard elementary was on a year-round schedule, and 
Brekke's low-cost, quick-action program was being hailed as a national model, 
said Charles Ballinger, executive director of the National Assn. for Year-Round 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of the most outstanding figures in the field," Ballinger said. 
"Norman Brekke was the first superintendent in the nation to determine that 
there was a cost benefit to taxpayers as well as an educational benefit to 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Brekke has written extensively on year-round education in 
professional journals and spoken at workshops nationwide, Ballinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke estimates that the district has saved $30 million through year-round 
education, because it has not built three elementary schools that would 
otherwise have been required. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Brekke took over, the district has grown from 11 schools and 8,900 
students to 17 schools and nearly 13,000 students today. 
</P>
<P>
 And the ethnicity of those students have changed as rapidly as their numbers. 
Two decades ago, 34% of the district's students were white and 53% were Latino. 
Today 15% are white and 76% are Latino. About 46% of all students in the 
kindergarten through eight-grade district do not speak English as their native 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With this transformation, came racial politics in the form of the 
desegregation lawsuit and in recent years high-profile tensions among the white 
and Latino members of the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 New plans to bus students from their own neighborhoods across town for racial 
balance, forced the wholesale scrapping of old enrollment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was basically turning the operation of our school district upside down," 
he said. "It was probably the most stressful, frustrating time of my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke said his role was not to agree or disagree with busing, but to 
implement the court order. But philosophically he favored it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He worked through that transition with an impressive level of work 
excellence," said Jack Fowler, a 21-year trustee. "He was constantly providing 
the board with extremely well-written and well-prepared reports." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, two Latina trustees have chastised the district for not doing 
enough to meet the needs of Spanish-speaking children. Board tensions, which 
have sometimes ended in angry exchanges, have flared. 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke's role behind the scenes was as impartial observer, board members say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always seemed to bring us back to the issue at hand," said Trustee Susan 
Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke will be remembered not only for his administrative skills, but for his 
humane touch in the classroom, since he spent his first six years after 
relocating from Oregon to Oxnard as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Lydia Martinez, 44, who was in Brekke's fourth-grade class at McKinna School, 
said he would do anything for his students. He once took Martinez and five 
other students to their first live theater performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew that we couldn't afford to pay for the tickets," Martinez said. "So 
he not only bought us tickets but he also picked us up at our homes and went to 
the play with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Grajeda, 36, said Brekke would buy poor children new shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just would go to the store and buy them," Grajeda said. "He is just very 
caring." 
</P>
<P>
 For all his Oxnard years, Brekke has maintained a modest demeanor and 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has lived in the same south Oxnard house for 35 years. He spends time in 
his rose and iris garden. He has raised five children and remains married to 
their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a husband, he was a father and then he had his job," Betty Brekke 
said. "He had his priorities straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Brekke, who has already sold his house and is heading to Oregon on Tuesday, 
said he would have not chosen any other place to make a career. But now as he 
returns to his native Oregon, he also ponders what he will leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be a profound adjustment for me," Brekke said. "This district 
is part of my family."

OXNARD OKS MINOR LEAGUE BALLPARK STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for a minor league baseball stadium in Ventura County moved a little 
closer to first base Tuesday when the Oxnard City Council agreed to help pay 
for a feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura and Camarillo -- the other cities interested in the project -- have 
already agreed to pay their shares of the $85,000 study, which also will come 
up with possible sites for the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Gagliardi, president of Class A California League, has pledged to bring 
a team to the area if the three cities can somehow deliver a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities have responded by hiring the Spectrum Group, an Irvine-based firm 
that helped bring minor league baseball to Lake Elsinore and Rancho Cucamonga, 
to do the study. It is the first step of an effort to build a stadium in time 
for the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The study will outline nine to 12 possible sites for the stadium, mostly along 
the Ventura Freeway. It will also contain attendance projections, marketing 
studies, demographic analyses and revenue estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, it will tackle the toughest obstacle facing the plan: finding 
private funding for the stadium. The cities have all vowed not to pay for the 
ballpark, which could cost up to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'd be prepared to spend much money, if any, on a park," 
Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said. "I think it would be beneficial to all the 
cities to have a park in this area. But we don't know who will pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most minor league teams can barely pay their operating costs, experts say, 
adding that expecting them to pay the mortgage on a stadium is out of the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Even funding a study on a stadium that may not be built in their community -- 
if it is built at all -- was questioned by some officials in each of the three 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But all three city councils eventually agreed to cooperate in funding the 
study, with some council members saying a minor league ballpark would increase 
quality of life in the area and provide low-cost family entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Several officials from each city toured stadium sites in Adelanto, Rancho 
Cucamonga and Lake Elsinore in February, concluding that the parks had a 
positive effect on those communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounting for differences in size, Camarillo will pay $15,725, Ventura 
$27,030 and Oxnard $42,245 for the study. Camarillo will act as the main 
contact with the Spectrum Group, which plans to present its findings in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed stadium is expected to be a multipurpose facility that could also 
accommodate festivals, soccer and football games, as well as special events.

LAWYER GETS BARRIO POOL IN SWIM; OXNARD: A NEGLECTED LA COLONIA FACILITY WAS 
BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE AGAIN THIS YEAR WITH FUNDS RAISED BY THE CITY ATTORNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig was shocked last year when he first saw the 
decaying La Colonia swimming pool while on a tour of the barrio's new 
gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sitting there, unpainted, full of leaves, " Gillig said. "I thought 
something had to be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
 And he did something. With help from several other lawyers, Gillig raised 
$11,000 in a few weeks to reopen the pool. It was used last summer by up to 100 
youngsters a day. 
</P>
<P>
 This year Gillig had hoped that Oxnard would pick up the tab. But the pool was 
left out of the city budget for the third straight year. So Gillig grudgingly 
had to tap his attorney friends again. 
</P>
<P>
 They came through. And the pool opens today for the summer, which is all the 
kids care about. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the gangs that are out there, me and my friends just come here to 
have fun and get away from all of that," said 10-year-old Jose Centeno, hanging 
around the pool with his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed for many of the barrio's children, the pool is a refuge from poverty 
and trouble as much as from the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the children have trouble coming up with 50 cents to get into the 
pool. "But sometimes, they let us in for free," said Sonny Castro, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The older kids, vulnerable to the allure of gang life, also go to the pool, 
because they find they are more vulnerable to the lure of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come to look at the girls in bikinis," Ramon Rochin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council closed the pool in 1991 during budget cuts. Now city 
workers again maintain and manage it. But Gillig's money pays the maintenance 
crews. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pool closed last year after Labor Day, a $3,400 surplus remained, 
mainly because of pool fees collected over the summer. But $1,000 was spent on 
a new water pump, leaving Gillig with another formidable fund-raising 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 To Gillig's relief, he found that generous lawyers again opened their wallets. 
And there were new contributors -- notably City Clerk Daniel Martinez, who 
donated $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Duplicating last year's efforts, Gillig has raised $11,000 and hopes to 
receive more. The Businessmen of La Colonia, a local organization, has vowed to 
donate, and organizers of the Oxnard Salsa Festival said they will chip in too. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig eventually hopes to start a nonprofit La Colonia Memorial Park Pool 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 For the children at the pool, this year's success not only means it will be 
open again but also for longer periods each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool's new hours are noon to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get wet. It's cold and it's fun," said Daniel Cervantes, 12.

LET THE FIREWORKS BEGIN; ORGANIZERS PROMISE BIG BANGS SLATED FOR COUNTY WILL 
LIGHT UP SKY TO CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Thousand Oaks to the Ojai Valley, fireworks show organizers are gearing 
up for what will likely be the brightest Fourth of July to light up Ventura 
County skies in years. 
</P>
<P>
 No fewer than eight fireworks shows are scheduled throughout the county Monday 
night, with officials from each venue promising evening programs that will 
entice, amaze and thrill thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-year hiatus, Ventura will again host a fireworks show. But instead 
of at Ventura Pier, it will be staged at Ventura College, where music, dancing 
and other activities will liven up the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 One San Bernardino County company -- Pyro Spectacular of Rialto -- will 
produce seven of the eight shows, but that does not mean they will all be the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 The differing characteristics of each venue and the money each sponsoring 
group is able to spend dictate what will fly come dusk on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sky's the limit," said Jean Starr of Pyro Spectacular. "You spend more 
money, you get more fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
 More fireworks is what Ventura County residents will have to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows are planned for Fillmore, Santa Paula, Ojai, Oxnard, Ventura, Camarillo, 
Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley. Zambelli Fireworks of New Castle, Pa., will 
produce the Ojai show, with the others conducted by Starr's firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd highly recommend one of the venue shows where you need to go inside (an 
arena) to see," Starr said. "Those are your high-level fireworks, with American 
flags, a statue of Lincoln, the Liberty Bell and other patriotic images." 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is no intense competition, organizers of each show clearly think 
theirs will be the most fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the best show," said Kathy Matejka, who is overseeing the Pleasant 
Valley Recreation & Park District display that begins at 9:10 p.m. at the 
Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we have a large fall-out area, we're able to have bigger shows," 
Matejka said. "We have more bang for our buck." 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo show will be free except for a $10 parking charge, which Matejka 
said will encourage car-pooling and generate money for next year's show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously very subjective, but we take a great deal of pride in laying 
the groundwork ahead of time," Matejka said of the $10,000 extravaganza. "It's 
a wonderful location that's visible from all angles and perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Independence Day Committee is spending just $5,300 on its display. 
But organizers in the Ojai Valley say theirs is the oldest and most 
traditional. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done it and done it, so we know what works and what doesn't," said Walt 
Reimer, who is coordinating the 31st annual fireworks show at the Nordhoff High 
School football field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we have a nice warm evening and that's important," he said. "In a 
way, it's a little hokey because it's old-time and small-town stuff, but that's 
part of the attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Gass of the Conejo Recreation & Park District expects as many as 20,000 
people will gather in The Oaks mall parking lot to watch the hilltop fireworks 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been at that location for 15 years and it provides a very good viewing 
radius for most of the community," Gass said of the Thousand Oaks show, which 
also is free. "You can park miles away and still see." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo show will be set to music and broadcast live over KNJO-FM. 
Organizers said they spent $15,000 on the fireworks show alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours is completely aerial because of the location," Gass said. "The largest 
shells go up quite a ways. You can see them all the way from Newbury Park." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth of July celebrants in Simi Valley hope to break a world record while 
observing the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 5,000 or more people expected at the Simi Valley High School 
football field will be asked to perform what sponsors hope will be the largest 
country line dance ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have as many people as are interested come out of the stands 
and the endzones," said Rick Johnson, a park district official. "I think the 
(existing) world record is about 2,400 people. But we usually get about 5,000 
people at the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Tovias declined to say how much the Santa Paula Mexican-American Chamber 
of Commerce is spending on its show. But he said the program at George Harding 
Park has gotten more and more popular since he started it seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've pulled a lot of people from Camarillo and Ventura the last couple of 
years," he said. "You can see it from all over town, so it's probably viewed by 
20,000 or 30,000 people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura production marks the first time the Downtown Rotary Club and the 
college have sponsored a fireworks show.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not having a show at night for several years is a big plus," said organizer 
Nancy Cloutier, who expects as many as 10,000 people at the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura Rotary wanted to fill the void of no fireworks in the city and we 
thought this would be a safe venue at the college," she said. "It should be 
pretty spectacular for $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura abandoned its fireworks-at-daybreak experiment several 
years ago after canceling the twilight beach show. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard fireworks show organizers said it does not matter which of the events 
people go to -- so long as they attend one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they will all be good shows," said Bill Garlock, the special events 
coordinator for the city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is they go to any one of them, simply to recognize the 
independence and freedom they've got," Garlock said. "It's the one time of year 
we have to stop and pause and think about how lucky we are."

 Oxnard insurance broker Greg Anderson will be installed today as president of 
the American Heart Assn. Oxnard/Port Hueneme/Channel Islands Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, 46, has been on the board of directors for one year, and will take 
his position as board president at an awards dinner tonight. He will replace 
outgoing President Geri Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a fairly exciting year for the chapter," Anderson said. 
"We're looking for more participation from all sectors of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 As board president, Anderson said he intends to reach out to more educators, 
volunteer groups and social clubs for support. Traditionally the business 
community has been the strongest supporter of the nonprofit organization 
because businesses are often approached for donations, Anderson said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CASITAS SPRINGS; BOY, 4, STARTS BLAZE, BURNS FAMILY 
DUPLEX

 A 4-year-old Casitas Springs boy who was playing with fire started a blaze 
Tuesday afternoon that destroyed the rear end of his family's duplex, causing 
$60,000 in damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No residents were hurt in the fire, which occurred in the 8800 block of Nye 
Road about 2:20 p.m., but Firefighter Mark Fisher was treated for heat 
exhaustion at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze was started by Trevor Allen, who was playing with an undisclosed 
fire source under his bed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a thing with kids that age -- especially boys," Ventura County Fire 
Investigator Bill Hager said. "They're curious about fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor's baby-sitter, Helena Maria Ortiz, 21, told firefighters that she saw 
flames between the bed and the wall. She grabbed the boy and ran out of the 
duplex, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they did not hear any smoke alarms before the blaze broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Hager said fire officials will decide later whether to offer any counseling to 
Trevor. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY TO START TALKS ON WATER SYSTEMS LINK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ventura has become the first of five major water suppliers in 
Ventura County to endorse a plan to discuss linking the area's disparate water 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Stung by the drought a few years ago and alarmed by the earthquake in January, 
the major purveyors say they want to consider linking their water systems with 
neighbors in order to share in times of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura council voted 4 to 0 Monday to allow city officials to begin 
discussions with officials from the other agencies. Calleguas Municipal Water 
District has approved the discussions in concept, but has been waiting for at 
least one other agency to sign off on it before formally approving the talks, 
said Donald Kendall, the agency's general manager. Calleguas is a wholesaler 
that distributes water to Moorpark, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and 
Oxnard.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY ANNEXES TINY CABRILLO VILLAGE

<P>
 The estimated 1,000 people who live at Cabrillo Village officially became 
residents of the city of Ventura after the City Council annexed the tiny 
community just east of the city's existing boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council approved the neighborhood's annexation Monday night 
on a 4-0 vote, with council members Jack Tingstrom, Steve Bennett and Gregory 
L. Carson absent. 
</P>
<P>
 An unincorporated, 32-acre enclave, Cabrillo Village lies just southeast of 
Telephone Road, where Saticoy Avenue meets the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The village began in the 1930s as a farm labor camp, and now has 154 homes, a 
church, market, laundry room, community center, library and playground. 
</P>
<P>
 The city annexed Cabrillo Village at the request of the Local Agency Formation 
Commission, a state-sponsored county panel that regulates changes in boundaries 
for cities and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement, which had been provided by Ventura County sheriff's deputies, 
will now be turned over to the Ventura Police Department. The village already 
receives city fire protection and city water, sewage and trash services.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK VIEW; FIRE AT BLACK FAMILY'S HOME RULED ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department has closed its investigation into an 
Oak View fire that destroyed a black family's home earlier this month, 
concluding that the blaze was accidental and not sparked by a firebomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators said last week that the blaze was caused by a smoldering 
cigarette, but sheriff's detectives continued to interview witnesses because 
family members were adamant that a crime had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to be very thorough because the family initially believed it 
was a hate crime," said Lt. Craig Husband of the sheriff's Major Crimes 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Husband said authorities could find "absolutely nothing" to support the 
witnesses' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department became involved in the fire investigation immediately 
after the pre-dawn blaze occurred on June 7 because there was a suspicion that 
it could have been caused by arson. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PETITION SEEKS VOTE OVER RENT CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of an statewide initiative that would leave mobile home rent 
controls up to park owners instead of local and state government turned in 
nearly 600,000 signatures to place the item on the November ballot, organizers 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15,000 of the initiative's supporters are from Ventura County, local 
elections officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kradin) of Californians for Mobile Home Fairness said hundreds of 
petitions were turned in Monday to elections officials in each of the state's 
58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel confident that with the number of signatures collected, the 
initiative will qualify for the ballot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by voters, the mobile home initiative would invalidate all 
existing state rent-control laws and prohibit new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly for Ventura County mobile home residents, the initiative 
would limit local rent subsidies -- which would be administered by park owners 
-- to no more than 10% of residents and allow for annual rent increases equal 
to the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half of Ventura County's mobile home park residents receive some form 
of rent subsidy, according to park owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative itself and the campaign by its supporters have drawn criticism 
from mobile home park residents, who fear the park owners would eventually 
price them out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 105 mobile home parks scattered across Ventura County, and more than 
10,000 coaches, according to the state division of codes and standards, which 
regulates mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 About 385,000 valid signatures of registered voters are needed for the 
initiative to qualify for the fall ballot. It will take several weeks for 
elections officials around the state to certify the signatures. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BUDGET HEARINGS FOR AGENCIES DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still hoping criminal justice programs can be spared, Ventura County leaders 
delayed budget hearings on the sheriff's and district attorney's departments 
until they learn the full extent of state funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to make sure that we have all the numbers," Supervisor Vicky 
Howard said. "The other departments know they're going to get cut, that's just 
a given. So we can go ahead with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled for today, hearings for the two agencies will now be held July 13, 
well after the state Legislature's Friday deadline for submitting a final 
budget to the governor.  
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, the state plan could clip $10 million to $12 million from 
Ventura County's allocation. Officials are hoping a legislative maneuver will 
limit some of the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the County Board of Supervisors has asked each of its agencies to 
consider the impact of 8% and 18% cuts on their 1995 fiscal year budgets. The 
deeper reductions would be necessary if the cuts match estimated reductions and 
the board decided to leave public safety untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see criminal justice being hit," Supervisor John K. Flynn said. 
"We've already made a commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the board pledged $24 million in sales tax revenue to hire new 
sheriff's deputies and prosecutors. He said the county might be able to divert 
some excess revenue from Proposition 172 sales tax, but should not cut into the 
money already set aside for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Other county agencies, however, say they will be hard-pressed to cut into 
their budgets, especially after five years of cuts. Ventura County Medical 
Center, along with Public Health and Mental Health departments, will present 
their budget needs at a hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the county board also voted to disband its budget subcommittee, a 
panel that once yielded influence over spending policy but recently has become 
redundant as the same information must be presented to the full board. PHYLLIS

STATE CALLS RAIL CROSSING DANGEROUS; SAFETY: LOCAL OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, QUESTION 
WHETHER THE SITE WEST OF MOORPARK IS THAT PERILOUS. NO IMPROVEMENTS ARE 
EXPECTED BEFORE 1996. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A railroad crossing just west of Moorpark is one of the most dangerous 
crossings in California, a new state report says, but it may be years before 
improvements are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local officials, meanwhile, question whether the crossing is particularly 
perilous. 
</P>
<P>
 The crossing, on California 118 just west of Grimes Canyon Road, made the 
California Public Utilities Commission list because a high amount of rail and 
road traffic increases the likelihood of accidents, said Raymond Wong, an 
engineer for the agency. The Moorpark crossing is the only one in Ventura 
County on the state's priority list for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Pacific track runs parallel to the two-lane highway on both sides 
of the crossing, which resembles an extremely distended X. Crossing gates and 
flashing lights stop traffic on the highway, where the speed limit is 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The priority list will be used by the California Transportation Commission in 
its effort to eliminate hazardous crossings by building overpasses or 
underpasses, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the Moorpark site ranked 37th on the list of 62 crossings, no 
improvements are expected before 1996, when a new list will be drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a limited amount of money for this type of construction," said Wong, 
who helped draw up the list. "We don't decide who will get funding, but believe 
me, those that are ranked 10 or 11 would be lucky to, if they got the money. I 
doubt anything (at the Moorpark crossing) will happen in at least the next two 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 The state has set aside $15 million for each of the next two years to 
eliminate dangerous rail crossings, Wong said. The city, county or state agency 
responsible for the roadway must submit a proposal for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 No single agency is allowed to receive more than $5 million per year for a 
project, he said. And each agency is expected to contribute at least 10% of the 
construction cost, with the railroad adding an additional 10%, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because California 118 is a state highway, responsibility falls to Caltrans to 
submit a proposal to eliminate the crossing hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no plans for construction in that area," Russ Snyder, a Caltrans 
spokesman, said. "It's not on any of our lists as a significant hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the California Highway Patrol, which polices the roadway, 
also said the site was not especially hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked here six years and I don't remember a single accident there that 
was train-related," Officer Staci Morris, a CHP spokeswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from Metrolink, which shares the rail line with theSouthern 
Pacific Transportation Co. and Amtrak, also said they could not recall any 
accidents at the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not to say that there isn't a danger," Peter Hidalgo, a spokesman for 
Metrolink, said. "We'd like to eliminate any kind of grade-crossing hazard, but 
these projects can sometimes cost $5 (million) to $10 million and we have to 
weigh that with the number of incidents. I am not aware of any there." 
</P>
<P>
 The last major railroad accident that occurred near the site was about a half 
mile to the west on a private road that crosses the tracks. That road lacks a 
crossing gate or flashing lights. 
</P>
<P>
 A van stopped on the tracks for an unknown reason and was struck in December, 
1992. Three of the occupants were killed and another was seriously injured.

$1.15 MILLION IN QUAKE AID SET ASIDE FOR HOMEOWNERS; SIMI VALLEY: THE FEDERAL 
FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME RESIDENTS IN THE FORM OF 
GRANTS OR LOW-INTEREST LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying some earthquake victims still need help, the Simi Valley City Council 
has set aside $1.15 million in federal aid money to be doled out in $5,000 
grants to the poor and $20,000 loans to low- and moderate-income homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and mobile home owners would have to prove that they have exhausted 
all other sources of emergency aid before applying for the money, which the 
council appropriated Monday night from a $5.5-million pot of federal emergency 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans and grants could become available as early as August, Deputy City 
Manager Laura Herron said. But city officials are still waiting for the 
granting agency -- the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development -- to 
give full approval to the aid plan, including a review of its environmental 
impacts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5,000 grants will be available to owners of houses, condominiums and 
mobile homes who fit into the low-income category -- such as a family of four 
with an annual income of $39,954 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 These people also could be eligible for low-interest loans of up to $20,000, 
as could any homeowner of low- or moderate income, such as a family of four 
earning $69,000 a year or less. However, applicants must choose one option or 
the other, Herron said; no one will be given both a grant and a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, city staff recommended that the $5,000 grants be given only to 
mobile homeowners and the $20,000 loans to owners of houses or condos, but 
Councilman Bill Davis protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said many mobile home owners suffered far more than $5,000 damage, while 
some people who own houses or condos may be poor enough to qualify for the 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how we can separate this grant between a mobile home, a single 
family home or an apartment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the council agreed that the money will be made available to owners 
of all types of single-family homes -- with grants going to low-income families 
and loans available to qualified borrowers with low or moderate income. 
</P>
<P>
 Herron said Tuesday that the city has not decided whether it will administer 
the loans itself or hire an outside contractor to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is available only to people who can prove they have already finished 
the aid application process for money from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency and the Small Business Administration and still have at least $10,000 
worth of unrepaired damage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loans are deferred loans," Herron said. "They are required to be paid 
back at such time as the property is sold or transferred . . . If they've 
already gotten an SBA loan, they're not going to be in a situation where they 
can repay it readily. This is a way of taking a hurdle away from people in that 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council also agreed Monday night to spend $50,000 in HUD money on 
another soil analysis for the city's hard-hit east end. 
</P>
<P>
 A state geologist's report earlier this month concluded that the earth had 
stopped moving beneath homes south of Los Angeles Avenue near Yosemite Avenue 
after the Jan. 17 earthquake, but it conceded that soil near the surface could 
still be settling. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry homeowners pointed to ongoing damage in their houses, calling the report 
inadequate and demanding that the city pay for a more intensive survey. 
</P>
<P>
 This study, said Mayor Greg Stratton, will determine what they must do to 
stabilize their lots before they start repairing or rebuilding their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted Monday to spend up to $132,000 of the HUD money to 
repair earthquake damage to the sides of the Arroyo Simi flood channel.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; THE NEWEST COLOR INK-JET PRINTERS CATCH UP WITH COLOR COMPUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Color printing has finally caught up with color computing. You can print 
exciting-looking documents with colorful logos, graphs and photos on any of 
four modestly priced color ink-jet printers for Windows or Macintosh computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the bunch, Epson America Inc's. brand-new Stylus Color Printer, is 
not only capable of a stunning 720-dots-per-inch resolution on special paper, 
it can turn out a full-color, full-page photo in less time than its 
Hewlett-Packard competitor can print the same image at 300 dots per inch. And 
in its 360-dots-per-inch mode, the Epson is more than three times faster than 
the H-P printer. For a full-page color photo, that is the difference between 
five minutes and 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, excellent print quality -- and more robust construction -- is available 
from H-P's DeskJet 560C color ink-jet printer and Apple Computer's Color 
StyleWriter Pro. Canon Computer Systems' BJC-600 color ink-jet printer, which I 
haven't tested, is essentially the same as the Apple Color StyleWriter Pro and 
can be expected to deliver similar performance. (Although the only Macintosh 
color printer I tested was Apple's, that is not your only choice. The 
Hewlett-Packard DeskWriter 560C is configured for the Macintosh. A Macintosh 
version of Epson's printer is due out this fall.) 
</P>
<P>
 You won't find much difference in price among the H-P, Apple and Canon 
printers and, depending on where you shop, all can be bought for less than 
$650. Street prices of the new Epson should be similar. If you mainly print 
color graphics such as charts, graphs, logos and the like, rather than color 
photos, you'll probably not see much difference among any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some earlier color ink-jet printers, such as H-P's DeskJet 500C, all of 
these printers have four colors of ink: black and the three printing process 
colors of cyan (blue), magenta and yellow. That assures that you can print true 
black plus virtually any other color in the spectrum. (The DeskJet 500C, 
lacking black ink, simulates black by adding equal amounts of the three process 
colors, which creates a greenish black and uses three times as much ink.) 
</P>
<P>
 A significant advantage offered by the Apple and Canon printers is a separate 
ink cartridge for each color. You replace only the color that runs out. Both 
the HP and Epson printers have a separate black ink cartridge, but the three 
process colors share the second cartridge. When one color runs dry, you pay to 
replace all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people will find these printers adequate substitutes for laser printer 
when printing black-only documents. They are a little slower than most laser 
printers, but it is hard to see any difference in print quality. The 
Hewlett-Packard printers have an edge in black-only printing because they have 
a higher resolution in black of 600 by 300 dots per inch. Color resolution is 
limited to 300 dots per inch vertically and horizontally. 
</P>
<P>
 One characteristic that all of these new printers share is the much greater 
sophistication of software control they bring to the printing process, compared 
to earlier color ink-jet printers. Whether in Windows or on the Macintosh, the 
printer "driver" software that comes with these printers enables you to 
fine-tune the printer's behavior according to what kind of file is being 
printed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewlett-Packard's Windows printer driver has something called ColorSmart that 
can automatically alter the way various sections of a page are printed 
according to the kind of data being printed. A color photo gets one kind of 
setting to emphasize detail, while a simple color graph gets another treatment 
to make the colors rich and smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Epson Windows driver has a special "microweave" setting, which you must 
invoke manually. It intersperses the ink droplets with two passes of the print 
head to eliminate unwanted patterns of print head movement, called banding. But 
highest-resolution prints were marred slightly because the first quarter-inch 
of the image received only one pass of the print head and the color was 
noticeably lighter than the rest of the print. 
</P>
<P>
 The other weakness of Epson's printer is a flimsy paper tray. The upper tray, 
which holds paper after it is printed, looks especially fragile. I couldn't 
actually break it, however. It is so flexible that it deforms easily without 
breaking, then snaps back into shape when pressure is released. Maybe that's 
the idea. But there is nothing flimsy-looking about the Hewlett-Packard or 
Apple and Canon printers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all of these printers will produce good results on plain paper, it 
takes special paper to get the best out of them. And it takes different special 
paper for all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Epson has two different coated papers with flat finishes, one for 
360-dot-per-inch work and the other for 720 dots per inch. 
</P>
<P>
 H-P has a semi-glossy plasticized paper for its highest-quality work and it 
looks very good. But that same paper is too slick to feed properly in the Epson 
printer and produces washed-out images when it does go through. 
</P>
<P>
 The fanciest paper is Apple's backprint film, which produces a truly 
astounding glossy print that is hard to distinguish from a photograph. It does 
so by reversing the image (the printer driver does this automatically when you 
select backprint film in its dialogue box) and printing it on the dull, 
translucent backside of the film. You then view the image through the shiny 
front side and marvel at the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear in mind that getting the best out of any of these printers requires 
high-quality, 24-bit color image files, which in turn require large disk 
storage and high-performance photo manipulation software. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it is easy to get brilliant color into documents with 
ordinary spreadsheet graphs, scanned or clip-art logos and drawings, and by 
simply assigning colors to titles or headlines in word-processing files.

IN DEVELOPMENT: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; NEW 
CHIPS COULD USHER IN THE VIDEO CD ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Vinyl records long ago took a back seat to the compact disc. Now it looks as 
if videotapes may go the same route. Texas Instruments has introduced a set of 
chips that could make video compact discs as common as audio CDs. The company's 
three-chip set produces VHS-quality video and CD-quality sound for the emerging 
Video CD standard developed by JVC, Matsushita, Philips and Sony. 
</P>
<P>
 Video CD builds on the popularity of audio CDs and adds full-motion video and 
VCR-like features, such as fast forward, freeze frame and reverse. The Texas 
Instruments chip set uses compression technology that delivers video images 
comparable to videotape but with better sound quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-length movies or music videos can be played from one or two five-inch 
CDs, giving video enthusiasts the same digital quality, ease of use and greater 
durability provided by audio CDs. Because of the random-access nature of the 
digital technology, music video albums would seem a natural for the first Video 
CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 While Video CD does not provide as sharp an image as laser disc, the CDs will 
cost considerably less. That's because Video CD can take advantage of the major 
manufacturing cost reductions achieved for audio CDs. Movie companies, 
including MGM, Paramount and Columbia, as well as major record labels have 
announced plans to offer Video CD products. Texas Instruments says production 
quantities of its chip set will be available sometime late this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hardware, which could be in the stores by year's end, will be audio 
CD players with Video CD as a premium feature. Early reports suggest that the 
players could sell for less than $500. Conventional audio CDs will be playable 
on Video CD.

 Softening the Blow: Children think that games involving falling down are fun. 
But for anyone over age 65, falls are no laughing matter. The U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services estimates that a third of all people over 65 fall 
at least once a year, with the annual cost of medical care for hip fractures 
(the most common fall-related injury) estimated at $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, researchers at Pennsylvania State University are working on 
flooring that would be softer on older bones. The design involves two layers of 
urethane elastomer, a highly elastic material, separated by small columns of 
the same material. The floor can withstand someone walking or rolling a 
wheelchair on it. But when someone falls on it, the columns between layers 
buckle momentarily, cutting the impact by as much as 40%.

 Building Blood: One of the worst side effects of intensive chemotherapy is the 
sometimes fatal drop in blood platelets the treatment can cause. Since 
platelets are the blood cells responsible for clotting, low platelet counts can 
lead to excessive internal bleeding. This condition, known as thrombocytopenia, 
is currently treated through platelet transfusion or by lowering chemotherapy 
doses. But transfusion carries the risk of the immune system building up 
defenses against what it perceives to be foreign objects and rejecting the 
platelets. Lower chemotherapy doses might not be as effective.  
</P>
<P>
 But researchers at ZymoGenetics, a Seattle-based subsidiary of the Danish firm 
Novo Nordisk, in collaboration with the University of Washington, have cloned a 
hormone called thrombopoietin, or TPO. TPO belongs to a group of proteins known 
as cytokines, which stimulate the production of certain blood cells. While the 
TPO clone is a long way from commercialization, researchers report that it has 
stimulated the production of platelet levels in laboratory mice by more than 
400%.

 Eye Control: For most of us, the mouse was a big step forward when it came to 
controlling our computers. But if you think voice recognition will mean a great 
leap forward, guess again. Three Boston College faculty members think that 
maybe the eyes have it when it comes to making computers simpler to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers attach a series of electrodes around the user's eyes, where muscle 
movements generate electrical signals. The electrodes measure eye movements; 
the potential difference measured between the electrodes indicates the vertical 
and horizontal position of the retina. Focusing on the cursor causes it to move 
to wherever the eye moves. In one application, a person could sort through a 
large data bank by simply "looking" the cursor to the right entry. An auto in a 
simulated road race video game would move when you moved your eyes. People with 
limited use of arms, hands or fingers could benefit. But forget word processing 
for the moment: A single sentence requires moving the cursor around on an 
alphabet pad. It takes three minutes to write "It is working."

 Pressure-Cooking Toxic Chemicals: One of the techniques the U.S. military uses 
to render toxic materials and stockpiled chemical weapons harmless is to heat 
them in what amounts to a high-tech pressure cooker. This method, called the 
super-critical water technique, heats the chemicals and water in a reactor at 
temperatures of 400 degrees to 500 degrees Celsius and at a pressure of more 
than 5,000 pounds per square inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, chlorine and sulfur, common ingredients in several chemical 
warfare substances such as mustard gas, react strongly with the metal reactor 
walls and cause serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Houser, a Western Michigan University chemist, thinks a glass lining is 
the answer. Only the purest forms of glass can be used, because materials such 
as Pyrex react with super-critical water. The trick will be to balance the 
pressure inside and outside the glass container. While incineration is still 
the most common method to destroy toxic substances, including hazardous waste 
in landfills, super-critical water could clean up what's left even after 
incineration.

 Machines on a Chip: Silicon-based semiconductors have found their way into 
almost every kind of machine. But now machines are finding their way onto 
silicon chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The same etching process that is used to put transistors on a silicon wafer 
can be used to etch tiny diaphragms, beams and other structures measuring only 
a few thousandths of an inch or smaller. While much of the work on 
micro-machines is still being done in the laboratory, one area has shown 
commercial potential: sensors. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston-based Analog Devices, which recently received a $3.4-million grant 
under the federal Technology Reinvestment Project, has been providing 
micro-machined accelerometers for air bag deployment. But the company sees 
future automotive uses in sensors for anti-skid braking, yaw control and active 
suspension, among other things. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

SOCCER FANS CELEBRATING MEXICO'S ADVANCE CLASH AGAIN WITH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL and BOB ELSTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boisterous fans celebrating Mexico's advance in soccer's World Cup clashed 
Tuesday with police in Huntington Park, resulting in a near-riot in the city's 
central business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Several businesses were looted, police said, but there was no immediate 
estimate of damage. A 3-year-old girl was hit with a bottle and several 
officers suffered minor bruises, police said. There was no word on the girl's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, more than 100 revelers, mostly young men, ransacked a fireworks 
stand on Pacific Boulevard, quickly overpowering employees who tried to prevent 
the plunder. Ecstatic looters ran off with armfuls of Fourth of July fireworks, 
some of which were ignited and tossed back at police. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no way to celebrate," said a shaken Stella Garibay, who was working 
at the fireworks stand when the looters rushed it.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in the largely Latino city eight miles southeast of Downtown Los 
Angeles said arrests numbered no more than a dozen, as their priority was to 
disperse the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of riot-ready officers from half a dozen cities and the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department descended on the Pacific Boulevard shopping strip, 
where the melee broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities called Tuesday's disturbance worse than the outbreak of violence 
in the same area last Friday after Mexico's 2-1 World Cup victory over Ireland. 
Anticipating trouble, police had more than tripled their staffing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's incident began about 11:45 a.m., police said, shortly after Mexico 
tied its World Cup match with Italy, thus assuring its place in the second 
round. Throughout Los Angeles, Mexican supporters began to wave the green, 
white and red flag of Mexico and motorists honked their horns in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Park, police said, about 4,000 people gathered, and some began 
to pelt officers with rocks, bottles, fireworks and eggs. Huntington Park 
police called for reinforcements about 12:30 p.m., issuing a tactical alert 
seeking help from other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Many soccer fans drove to the Pacific Boulevard strip from elsewhere after 
news spread via word of mouth and reports that the area was the site of Mexican 
soccer celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 A phalanx of officers in riot gear soon pushed the rowdy crowd north up 
Pacific Boulevard, hurling several sting balls -- small non-lethal explosive 
devices filled with rubber pellets. Officers also used pepper spray and fired 
hard foam bullets, but Lt. Michael Gwaltney said no lethal force was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers soon dispersed the crowd from Pacific Boulevard, but many celebrants 
moved to nearby streets. Police were wary that violence could erupt anew, al 
though the situation was declared stable about 4 p.m. Officers closed off a 
10-block stretch of Pacific Boulevard during the afternoon and planned to keep 
it blocked off all evening. Scores of businesses were forced to shut their 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses maintained that aggressive police tactics aggravated matters. 
"I wasn't doing anything and the next thing I knew the officer sprayed me in 
the face," said Patricio Rojas of Huntington Park, who was recovering from the 
effects of what appeared to be pepper spray applied to his face. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lt. Gwaltney said officers only reacted after fans, some intoxicated, 
blocked traffic, began making hazardous turns and tossed items at police. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in Mexico City, there were reports of a death as fans crowded around 
the Independence Monument, traditional site of soccer celebrations.

LOBBYISTS' REPORTING LAW TIGHTENED; ETHICS: LAWYERS OR THEIR CLIENTS WILL HAVE 
TO PROVIDE DATA. MOVE IS AN ATTEMPT TO BYPASS A RULING THAT ATTORNEYS CITED IN 
REFUSING TO REVEAL ACTIONS. 
</P>

 After nearly four years of delays, the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday 
refined a lobbying law so that more lawyers will have to report their attempts 
to influence city government, but most neighborhood groups and nonprofit 
organizations will not. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously passed the first substantial revisions in the city's 
lobbying law since it was passed in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are designed to require the highest-paid advocates to report their 
activities and compensation to the city's Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The importance is that the public will know the forces that are attempting to 
affect the operation of city government," said Edwin Guthman, a member of the 
city's Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere around $10 million is spent a year, that we know about, to 
influence decisions at City Hall," Guthman added. "We think there is a lot more 
that we don't know about and this will help get to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics Commission officials said the most important change in the law will be 
one that requires lawyers to report all their lobbying activities, either 
directly or through their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many lawyers reported their lobbying and compensation under the old 
law, others refused to file reports with the Ethics Commission. They said that 
filing the reports would violate their confidential relationship with their 
clients. They cited a 1970 Supreme Court ruling on the city's law that said 
lawyers did not have to disclose their lobbying efforts in "quasi-judicial 
proceedings" -- which was interpreted by some lawyers to include most hearings 
involving land-use permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law seeks to circumvent that legal objection by requiring clients, 
rather than the lawyers, to report the lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Commission issues quarterly reports that show which clients paid 
lobbyists the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this will overcome any legal challenge," said Ben Bycel, executive 
director of the Ethics Commission. "Now everyone is on an even playing field 
and everyone will have to report. It moves the illumination of lobbying 
activities up from an 80-watt light bulb to a 200-watt light bulb." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who have objected to reporting requirements argued that disclosing how 
much they are paid does not serve the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin M. Reznik, a lawyer who frequently represents clients in planning 
cases, said the reporting of lawyers' fees can invade the privacy of clients. 
The public would know enough if lawyers simply reported whom they represented, 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows that I am there at City Hall as a paid representative for 
someone," Reznik said. "How much I am being paid is totally irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tighter requirements on lawyers, the revisions will lead to a net 
reduction in the number of reports filed with the Ethics Commission. That is 
because the council voted to only require lobbyists to file reports if they 
make more than $4,000 a quarter for lobbying at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 lobbyists are expected to file reports under the new system, compared 
to the more than 300 who file now. Many small groups and individuals who are 
paid little or nothing for their lobbying efforts will no longer file reports.

CONGREGANTS MOURN CHURCH'S LATEST FIRE; RELIGION: DAMAGE FROM THE SECOND BLAZE 
THIS MONTH IS PUT AT $1.2 MILLION. LEADERS WORRY ABOUT THE LESS TANGIBLE 
EFFECTS ON THEIR MULTICULTURAL WILSHIRE DISTRICT MEMBERSHIP. 
</P>

<P>
 The church where Shirley Temple was married, now home to a multicultural 
congregation that hears services in four languages, was hit with its second 
fire this month when its west wing burned Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 15 fire companies 59 minutes to extinguish the fire at Wilshire United 
Methodist Church, leaving portions of the wing gutted, prayer halls singed and 
the pipe organ destroyed, Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 6, the Wilshire district church was hit by a smaller, electrical fire 
that caused $120,000 in damage, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's fire, which is still under investigation, started at 11:03 p.m. and 
caused about $1.2 million in damage, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 Church members said they are worried about damage to less tangible things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have insurance," the Rev. Chang Soon Lee said Tuesday. "But what's 
important is the spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 That spirit is one of tolerance and unity, say those affiliated with the 
church. Wilshire United Methodist has eight services every Sunday in four 
languages -- English, Korean, Spanish and Tagalog, the Filipino language. 
Occasionally, the entire congregation joins for one large ceremony. The church 
provides rehearsal space to the Gay Men's Choir of Los Angeles and welcomes 
lesbians, gays and bisexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's outgoing pastor, the Rev. Alan Jones, says it is not uncommon to 
see Koreans or Filipinos attending English or Spanish services, and notes that 
the English-language ministry is about 70% black, with groups from the 
Caribbean and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a pioneering congregation. You don't find congregations like this 
often, when you find so many people sharing," Jones said. It is an example of 
cross-cultural unity, Jones said, and, after the fire, "people are anxious this 
is putting a block in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Church members were visibly upset when they came by Tuesday morning to survey 
the damage. One Filipino woman started sobbing as she entered the building. A 
group of Koreans stood in a circle in the church offices and uttered a brief 
prayer, then returned to dealing with the dozens of contractors, engineers and 
fire officials milling throughout the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of grieving, a lot," Jones said as he stood in a scorched 
prayer hall. "The people who really value this place . . . to see something 
like this is horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
 But many say the reaction to the latest fire is a testament to the 
congregation's unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone will stay together," the Rev. Mpyana Nyengle said, "because 
people have been calling and crying and talking about their sense of family." 
</P>
<P>
 That unity is based on sharing spiritually across cultures, say those 
associated with the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is a multicultural vision, so we want to be a good example of how 
different people live together," said Lee, who will take over as pastor July 1. 
"Even though we are different, the spiritual are able to be one family." 
</P>
<P>
 The church has changed considerably since it was founded in 1924. Back then it 
was a Congregational parish, Jones said, but it was sold in 1931 and became 
Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 For years the church served high society in the area and was the site of 
Shirley Temple's first wedding on Sept. 19, 1945. But "the population started 
to change," so the congregation changed with it, Jones said. Multilingual 
services have been phased in over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's services will be held in the Ebell Theater across the street. Church 
officials say they expect to be able to rebuild the church enough to have full 
services in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 And many are looking on the bright side. "It does show us we don't necessarily 
need a building to worship in," said Frances Keith, who has been going to 
Wilshire United Methodist for more than 40 years. "The building is not the 
church. We're the church."

COLISEUM REPAIR COSTS RISE 40%; EARTHQUAKE: TAB IS NOW EXPECTED TO REACH $50 
MILLION, BUT FEMA HAS PROMISED MORE HELP.

<P>
 Earthquake repair costs at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will reach $50 
million, Coliseum Commission President Yvonne Brathwaite Burke disclosed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be more than 40% above the original estimate of $35 million, but 
Burke, who is also a county supervisor, reported that she had received new 
assurances from James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, that federal funding already amounting to $34 million will increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said Witt assured her that "there will be no cash flow problem" as the 
repairs proceed. The target date for reopening the stadium is Sept. 3, when USC 
plays the University of Washington in its home opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt's press secretary, Morris Goodman, supported Burke's statements, saying: 
"FEMA will look at new damages and based on that inspection, we will pay all 
eligible costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said the steady increase in cost estimates for the repairs stem mainly 
from a need to use much more high-strength epoxy than expected to seal about 
10,000 cracks in the stadium caused by the Northridge earthquake. In addition, 
she said, it has cost more than expected to repair and seismically reinforce 
the historic peristyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Epoxy costs $100 a gallon and hundreds of gallons have been used, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The original $35-million repair estimate made in January by project director 
Don C. Webb was always tentative, and Webb had warned that it could rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The project director recently said he had assured FEMA representatives that 
the cost would not reach $80 million after they expressed concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman said Tuesday that Burke's new estimate might not be quite high enough 
and that costs would be "$50 million-plus." Another Coliseum official said 
costs could reach $60 million.

THOMPSON EXPECTED TO KEEP SCHOOL POST; EDUCATION: BOARD WILL RENEW 
SUPERINTENDENT'S CONTRACT BEYOND 1995 TO KEEP REFORM GOING, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Sid Thompson is close to winning an 
extension of his contract beyond its June, 1995, expiration, signaling a vote 
of confidence from the school board that he is steering district reform efforts 
in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thompson presiding over a major restructuring of the district, a majority 
of board members feel they cannot afford to upset the momentum of reform 
efforts by making Thompson a lame-duck superintendent in the next school term, 
according to district sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is definitely going to get an extension," board member Warren Furutani 
said Tuesday. "We feel we are on the right track and have the right 
superintendent to get this reform and restructuring done." 
</P>
<P>
 The main issue left undecided is the length of the contract extension, 
according to district sources. "He's going to get at least a year," one source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education has met behind closed doors five times in the last 
month to undertake a detailed evaluation of Thompson and his 20-month-old 
administration. His time at the helm has included a brush with insolvency, a 
10% salary cut for employees, the Jan. 17 earthquake -- the district's response 
to which got mixed reviews -- and a recent flap over a bungled $15-million 
grant from the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said, however, that a majority of the board favors keeping Thompson on 
the job and that the discussions have focused on whether to offer him a one- or 
two-year extension and how to ensure that he aggressively carries out the 
board's vision. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the evaluation of Thompson, the board has asked him for detailed 
management goals for his top deputies. On Monday the board approved 45-day 
contract extensions for 27 top administrators in the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Leticia Quezada declined to comment about the status of the 
discussions and said she expects to make an announcement July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the board's priorities for the Thompson administration include 
raising student achievement, increasing parent participation, decentralizing 
the district to give schools more power and improving race relations on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 After the board met privately for a fifth time Monday, Thompson said he had 
not been formally offered a new contract. But he said he was optimistic that he 
would remain at the helm beyond 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still smiling," Thompson said. "Don't worry. . . . I'm satisfied with 
what's going on in there." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times before the board discussions began, Thompson 
said he had asked the board to extend his contract, but he declined to say by 
how long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like an extension; I'm not finished yet," Thompson said a month ago, 
adding that if he were not allowed to continue beyond next year, "it would hurt 
me. It would hurt the system because then it becomes a matter of marking time 
until (I) get out and someone else comes in." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has worked to make significant changes in the district during his 
first year on the job, despite heavy quake damage at many schools. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Jeff Horton agreed Tuesday that Thompson has moved quickly 
to begin restructuring the district and that the board would "have to have damn 
good reasons" not to extend Thompson's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 While the board has been debating the superintendent's future, it has also 
been involved in its own round of politicking. As a result, five-year board 
veteran Mark Slavkin is likely to be elected July 11 to the board presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada, who has served a pair of one-year terms, said Tuesday that this is 
the appropriate time for her to step down. Typical board protocol calls for 
presidential terms of one to two years. The president runs meetings and serves 
as the chief spokesman on school board policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton had expressed an interest in the presidency, but he said Tuesday that 
he decided against seeking it after Slavkin gave assurances that issues 
important to Horton -- equity among all student groups and improving 
instruction -- would take a high profile.

WILLIAMS UPHOLDS FIRING OF WIND FOR HIS ROLE IN KING BEATING; POLICE: CHIEF 
OVERRULES RECOMMENDATION BY CAPTAIN THAT ROOKIE OFFICER SHOULD GET HIS JOB 
BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years after he was fired for his role in the Rodney G. King beating, 
Officer Timothy E. Wind's ties to the Los Angeles Police Department were 
officially severed Tuesday when Chief Willie L. Williams countermanded a 
recommendation that he get his job back. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling makes it impossible for Wind to become a Los Angeles police officer 
again unless a civil court judge overrules Williams. Wind's lawyer, Patrick J. 
Thistle, said he will take the case to court.  
</P>
<P>
 Wind, 34, was a rookie officer at the time of the King beating in March, 1991. 
Unlike other officers involved who were initially suspended without pay, Wind 
was not entitled to an internal administrative Board of Rights hearing before 
being fired because of his probationary status. But he was allowed to appeal 
the firing at a so-called liberty interest administrative hearing. In such 
hearings, it is up to the officer to show he is not guilty of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly four days of closed-door hearings that included testimony from 
several use-of-force experts, a police captain determined earlier this month 
that Wind deserved to get his job back. Patrol Capt. Robert Gale, according to 
sources, said the rookie officer was only following the orders of his 
superiors, but also recommended that Wind get a six-month suspension for 
improperly kicking King. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report to the chief, Gale said the department's internal charges -- 
that Wind unnecessarily struck King with his baton and failed to accurately 
depict the details of King's arrest in a report -- were unwarranted. Gale did 
agree with the accusation that Wind unnecessarily kicked King several times, 
but said, "I believe it was an act of desperation on his part" because of 
King's size and strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my belief that Officer Wind is the one person least culpable for the 
March 3, 1991, incident," Gale concluded. "Officer Wind did what we expect all 
probationary officers to do in similar situations -- back up your partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had the final say, however, and upheld Wind's May, 1991, firing, even 
though he was vindicated of criminal charges in two cases and cleared of 
wrongdoing in King's civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released late Tuesday, the LAPD said Williams reviewed Gale's 
recommendations June 28 and "directed that Timothy Wind be terminated from his 
employment with the Los Angeles Police Department effective May 8, 1991." An 
LAPD spokesman, Lt. John Dunkin, said the department and Williams would have no 
further comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Wind was unavailable for comment, but his lawyer said the news would be 
crushing to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind, Thistle said, "has suffered so much. He hasn't been able to work, he's 
had no income. Who is going to hire him?" 
</P>
<P>
 When told of Williams' decision, Thistle became angry and said the police 
chief's decision was politically motivated, and sends the wrong message to the 
rest of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a repudiation of the department's own system, which calls for a 
fair and unbiased hearing officer to make judgments after listening personally 
to evidence, and making a recommendation," said Thistle, who works with the 
police union, the Police Protective League. "Why in hell do we have these 
hearings if (Williams) just wants to throw it in the trash can and make up his 
own subjective reasons for firing someone? It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Wind was fired almost immediately after the March 3, 1991, King beating made 
national headlines. The LAPD conducted an informal investigation and fired Wind 
in May of that year, at the same time it suspended without pay fellow Officers 
Laurence M. Powell and Theodore J. Briseno and Sgt. Stacey C. Koon, the ranking 
officer at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind, who joined the force 10 months earlier, was alleged to have 
unnecessarily kicked King several times, struck him about 14 times with his 
baton and submitted a false arrest report on King after officers followed King 
on a high-speed chase and arrested him in a lot just off the Foothill Freeway.

STATE BEACHES KEEP COUNTY LIFEGUARDS FOR 6 MONTHS; SAFETY: A $1-MILLION PAYMENT 
WILL ENSURE SERVICES DURING THE SUMMER. TALKS WILL CONTINUE ON A LONG-TERM 
SOLUTION TO THE FUNDING DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles County lifeguards will continue to patrol state-owned beaches for 
at least another six months under an agreement approved Tuesday by the county 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The county had threatened to pull its lifeguards and maintenance crews from 
eight state-owned beaches, including Manhattan Beach, Malibu and Topanga, by 
July 1 if the state did not allocate more money to help cover the cost of 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Tuesday's agreement, the state promised to provide $1 million for beach 
services in exchange for a six-month extension of its contract with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement does not provide for a long-term funding solution. County and 
state officials said talks will continue over how much the state will 
contribute to the upkeep of its beaches. The county estimates that it costs 
about $4 million to provide lifeguard and cleanup services at the state-owned 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, state officials included wording to the effect that "this one-time 
appropriation should not be construed to be precedent-setting for future 
state/county negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, with the summer beach crush at hand, county officials were 
clearly relieved to have the issue resolved, if only temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the budget situation in Sacramento, we're very fortunate to have 
this agreement," said Supervisor Deane Dana. "I think they realize that this is 
saving lives, that they can't desert the beaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Megason, deputy director of the California Department of Parks and 
Recreation, said the state decided that it would be unwise to risk disrupting 
service at the height of the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is willing (to do) whatever is necessary to protect public safety," 
Megason said, "and we felt it would be better not to have a change during this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 An impasse over beach funding has been brewing for a number of years, with the 
cash-strapped county arguing that the state and beach cities must significantly 
increase their share of beach-related costs. Officials on the other side have 
been just as adamant in arguing that beaches are used and enjoyed by residents 
countywide and are a regional responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach supporters, meanwhile, say it would be disastrous to return to the days 
when city, county and state lifeguards patrolled the beaches within yards of 
each other in an uncoordinated system that confused authorities and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is also asking the cities of Hermosa Beach, Avalon, Redondo Beach, 
Manhattan Beach, Los Angeles and Santa Monica to pay more for beach costs and 
has threatened to pull its services from beaches owned or controlled by those 
cities by April 1 if no agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Reed, county chief administrative officer, said that there has been 
progress in those negotiations and that the two sides are scheduled to meet 
again July 21.

CERTIFICATION OF LONG BEACH RECOUNT BARRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge blocked the Long Beach City Council on Tuesday from 
certifying the results of a controversial recount that gave the apparent loser 
a one-vote victory in a City Council election. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert H. O'Brien also allowed Tonia Reyes Uranga to examine some 
questionable ballots that led to her one-vote loss to contractor Mike 
Donelon.Long Beach officials had refused to give her access to the ballots.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council was scheduled to consider Tuesday night whether to certify 
contractor Donelon's narrow victory over Uranga, one of the first two Latinos 
elected to the nine-member council earlier this month.  
</P>
<P>
 But O'Brien temporarily blocked any council action while Uranga is examining 
some ballots that were rejected for various reasons by City Clerk Shelba 
Powell. Long Beach officials had said that election codes prohibit the city 
from releasing election materials to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga, a community activist and former president of the Long Beach Children's 
Museum, was ahead by seven votes entering the recount June 22, but her margin 
was erased when the city clerk's office found several uncounted ballots. The 
recount put Donelon ahead, 2,932 to 2,931. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the city clerk's office acknowledged that a mistake had been 
made, but said the final tally is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga called O'Brien's ruling "one step on the road to the truth."  
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Robert E. Shannon said the city will comply with the 
decision. "We felt the documents Uranga was requesting weren't public records, 
so we wanted the court to order us to give them to her."

FIRST MAJOR DEAL MADE IN SMOG MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first major transaction in the Southland's fledgling "smog market," a 
major manufacturer in Huntington Park invested more than $1 million Tuesday 
buying pollution credits.  
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Glass Container Corp. bought the right to emit 3.446 million pounds of 
nitrogen oxide pollution from Union Carbide, based in Torrance, for $1.21 
million, or 37 cents per pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the smog market known as RECLAIM, the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District has granted about 300 Southland industries annual allocations guiding 
how much pollution they can emit. Each year, the allowed pollution drops about 
8%. Companies that cut emissions below their annual limit can sell their excess 
credits to other companies that may have more trouble meeting their limit. 
</P>
<P>
 The air pollution trading program began in January, and because there was only 
a smattering of early trading, many critics said the program was not as 
successful as hoped. Air quality officials and economists, however, said the 
businesses were simply cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been no substantive trade before this," said AQMD spokesman Bill 
Kelly. "It's taken companies a while to figure out where they stand. They don't 
want to rush into million-dollar decisions."

COUNTY MAY BOOST CHARGES AT BEACHES, PARKS; BUDGET: PARK ENTRY FEE OF $2 PER 
VEHICLE IS SAID TO BE AMONG THE STATE'S LOWEST. TO HELP OFFSET AN EXPECTED 
REVENUE SHORTFALL, OFFICIALS ARE ALSO STUDYING ENDING $248,000 IN ANNUAL CITY 
LIFEGUARD SUBSIDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when residents are flocking to Orange County's beaches and parks to 
escape the summer heat, county officials are considering plans to increase 
parking and entry fees to keep pace with rising maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget shortfalls, estimated this year at nearly $1 million, could also force 
the county to eliminate $248,000 in payments that the county makes yearly to 
cities to subsidize the cost of staffing beaches throughout the county with 
lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifeguard payments to Seal Beach, Laguna Beach, Newport Beach and San 
Clemente are guaranteed for at least the next two years, but any attempt to 
phase them out is not sitting well with some city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be hurt by that, definitely," said Tony Melum, deputy director of 
Newport Beach's Marine Department, which receives nearly $100,000 per year in 
lifeguard subsidies. "Our main concern is to get (lifeguards) on the beach and 
the city has been in a budget reduction mode in the past three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the county Environmental Management Agency's harbors, beaches and 
parks division expressed their budget concerns Tuesday as part of an annual 
financial review of the division presented to the Board of Supervisors. 
Officials provided no estimates of how much the entrance and parking fees could 
be raised, if at all, and it was not immediately known when the matter could be 
scheduled for consideration by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said the local entry charge to county parks -- $2 
per vehicle -- is among the lowest in California and could be helping to 
attract more visitors, resulting in more "wear and tear" on park properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Scofield, Environmental Management Agency deputy financial manager, said 
the county's $2 entry charge is at least $2 less than comparable fees charged 
by the state and the counties of Riverside, San Bernardino and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge is especially hard to ignore, officials said, when overall revenue 
has declined by $4.5 million since 1991-1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're reaching a point now where we're not able to continue the 
simple maintenance needed to keep the parks in shape," Vasquez said. "Because 
of our excellent facilities and low cost, people are choosing to come here. We 
need to get out there and see how we can maximize our revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said the county might consider fee increases during peak summer 
weekends and holidays to take advantage of the larger crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County operates three harbors, eight public beaches, 16 parks, two 
nature preserves, six historical sites and more than 100 miles of recreational 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get done paying expenses with the revenues available, there just 
isn't much left for new construction or other needs," Scofield said. "We have 
to adjust our priorities. To do that, we are going to do a fee study and it 
will be up to the (Board of Supervisors) after that." 
</P>
<P>
 On recent weekends, Scofield and Newport Beach's Melum said, parks and beaches 
have been packed with visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the down economy, and because it's already been a hot summer, I 
think we are seeing people who are looking for a cheaper way to recreate," 
Melum said. "The crowds have been unusually large."

DEPUTY'S KIN FILE WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS; COURTS: FAMILY OF DARRYN LEROY ROBINS, 
FATALLY SHOT IN A TRAINING EXERCISE, SEEKS MORE THAN $15 MILLION IN DAMAGES 
FROM THE COUNTY. SEPARATE CLAIM ALLEGES FELLOW LAWMAN VIOLATED SLAIN MAN'S 
CIVIL RIGHTS.

<P>
 Accusing the Orange County Sheriff's Department of misconduct, the family of a 
deputy who was shot in the face by a fellow deputy during a Christmas Day 
training drill has filed wrongful death claims seeking more than $15 million in 
damages from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Robins, the widow of deputy Darryn Leroy Robins, alleges that 
Sheriff's Department and county officials knew that deputies were holding 
training sessions with loaded weapons in violation of department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim, also filed on behalf of Robins' 2-year-old daughter, Melissa, seeks 
damages from the county, Sheriff's Department and the city of Lake Forest, 
where the shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate claim, the slain deputy's mother, Mildred Fisher, alleges that 
Deputy Brian P. Scanlan violated the civil rights of her son, who was black. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother further alleges that Scanlan, who is white, has a history of 
"reckless conduct" and racial discrimination and that sheriff's authorities, 
along with other state and county officials, were negligent in keeping Scanlan 
on the force.  
</P>
<P>
 The claims are the family's first public criticism of the department since the 
death of the 30-year-old deputy, known for his work in helping local 
schoolchildren stay free of drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan Martini declined to comment Tuesday on the claims, 
except to say the action should be not seen as pitting the Robins family 
against Sheriff Brad Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sheriff Brad Gates has a very close bond with Rosemary, Melissa and the 
family," Martini said. "I don't think there would be anything in his lifetime 
that would interfere with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Anne Yeager Higgins, who is representing Fisher, declined to discuss 
the mother's claim, which seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Rosemary Robins and Scanlan did not return calls seeking 
comments on the case. The widow's claim seeks $10 million for the loss of care, 
comfort and support from her husband, $5 million in estimated lost earnings and 
$10,000 for funeral and burial expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Bunker, the county's claims manager, said the claims, filed last week, 
are being reviewed. The county has 45 days from the filing of the claims to 
issue a response to the family. Such claims must be filed before a lawsuit can 
be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the two deputies were running through a mock car-stop behind 
a Lake Forest movie theater, with Robins playing the suspect and Scanlan the 
arresting officer, when the shooting occurred. Scanlan, a 32-year-old field 
training deputy, told investigators that he shot Robins accidentally after he 
was startled to see Robins pull a handgun from the visor of his patrol car. 
Robins, authorities said, was apparently imitating a technique used by gang 
members against police. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the Orange County Grand Jury rejected a prosecutor's request to 
indict Scanlan. The district attorney's office had recommended that Scanlan be 
charged with involuntary manslaughter, saying he was "grossly negligent" in 
training with a loaded weapon during the impromptu exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman in Washington has previously said the 
department is investigating whether grounds exist to indict Scanlan on criminal 
charges under federal civil rights law. Local black leaders and other community 
groups, critical of the way the volatile case was handled locally, had prodded 
the Justice Department to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

BOARD OKS FUNDS TO FINGERPRINT COUNTY RELIEF APPLICANTS; GOVERNMENT: THE NEARLY 
$1.3-MILLION SYSTEM WOULD LINK ORANGE AND LOS ANGELES COUNTIES TO ENSURE 
GENERAL AID RECIPIENTS AREN'T GETTING HELP FROM BOTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an effort to stop people from registering more than once for general 
relief, the Orange County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to spend nearly 
$1.3 million on a program to fingerprint aid applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The county expects to get back its investment and save an estimated $64,000 
over 54 months -- with possible expansion and greater savings down the road, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no choice," said Angelo Doti, director of financial assistance in the 
county Department of Social Services. "I think this is the forerunner of what 
will sweep the nation for public assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in mid-September or October, people applying for general relief in 
Orange County and those already on the rolls will be fingerprinted. Those 
prints will be run through a computer system shared with Los Angeles County to 
make certain they are not already receiving aid in either county. 
</P>
<P>
 The fingerprinting would apply only to the 3,600 adults on general relief in 
Orange County. But the concept is likely to be expanded to other aid 
recipients, including the nearly 40,000 parents of children on welfare, 
according to Doti and other social service officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County, which has been fingerprinting general aid recipients for 
three years, in April started including adult recipients in the Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children program as part of a state demonstration project. If 
that experiment also reduces abuses, the state Department of Human Services is 
expected to recommend fingerprinting statewide for AFDC. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti said he believes fingerprinting will be the answer to the easy 
availability of false identifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand for $30 you can buy a complete identification, including 
driver's license, social security card and a so-called green card," he said. 
Moreover, he said, courts have ruled that welfare agencies may not require poor 
people to have identification in order to receive aid.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board's decision to begin fingerprinting drew mixed reviews 
from the people most affected by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cool," said Henry Valejo, 37, an unemployed door maker who said he now 
receives $280 a month in general relief and $112 in food stamps. He was seated 
outside the county Social Services office on Walnut Avenue, surrounded by 
satchels filled with his belongings.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he wouldn't mind being fingerprinted if it would stop fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it should have been done a long time ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others waiting in the lobby agreed that fingerprinting was a practical 
solution to a very real problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Hartman, an unemployed psychology instructor from Santa Ana, said 
he worried about how the move would affect the self-esteem of people who are 
already feeling down and out. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the prospect of fingerprinting, coupled with the metal detector 
installed at the door of the welfare office last month, contributed to "the 
atmosphere of a jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the new program's success will be its link with the existing 
fingerprinting program in Los Angeles County, said Arnold Winkle, Orange 
County's administrative manager of information systems. He estimated that 60% 
of the savings will come from catching Los Angeles County residents who 
illegally apply for general assistance in Orange County using false 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County program, run by Electronic Data Systems Corp., has 
saved about $2 million since June, 1991, said Lisa Nunez, chief of the computer 
services division of the Los Angeles County Public Social Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti said it is hoped fingerprint matching also will detect people who have 
been temporarily suspended from general assistance in either county because 
they refuse to abide by the rules, such as participating in work programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Freed, executive assistant to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who has 
been the board's chief advocate for the fingerprinting, said the $64,000 is 
"just a tip of the iceberg" in potential local savings from the program. She 
said San Diego County already is considering joining the system, which would 
broaden the net for catching double dippers. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the program, Freed said, "is to have the resources available 
for the truly needy." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they have not received complaints from advocates for the 
poor about fingerprinting being an invasion of privacy or tool of 
discrimination. One reason, they said, is that the county has given assurance 
that the fingerprint information will not be given to law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't opposed to it," said John Palacio of the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Education Fund. "It will not only protect the taxpayer but the 
recipients. If their ID is misplaced or stolen, it will ensure that their 
benefits are not being used by someone else."

LAGUNA TO LET SOME MYSTIC HILLS RESIDENTS REBUILD; GEOLOGY: A NEW REPORT 
QUESTIONING THE BOUNDARIES OF AN ANCIENT LANDSLIDE PROMPTS OFFICIALS TO 
COMMISSION ANOTHER STUDY. FIRE VICTIMS MUST PROVE THEIR LOTS ARE ON STABLE 
GROUND BEFORE CONSTRUCTING HOMES. 
</P>

<P>
 Faced with differing opinions from geologists about the size of an ancient 
landslide in the Mystic Hills community, the Laguna Beach City Council agreed 
Tuesday to let fire victims there rebuild if they can prove their lots are 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to spend another $25,000 to pinpoint the southern 
boundary of the potentially unstable area, which includes several rows of homes 
above City Hall.  
</P>
<P>
 It was evident from applause that erupted regularly throughout the evening 
that most in the audience wanted the city to stand aside so they can begin 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 But with conflicting geological findings clouding the question of whether a 
large landslide exists under the lots, others urged the council to do further 
studies. Until they know whether their lots are on stable ground, some fear 
future property values will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been raised, and until its resolved one way or the other . . . it's 
a lose-lose deal," said Roger Stewart, who lost his Mystic Hills home in the 
October firestorm. "I don't see a light at the end of this tunnel. I see pay, 
pay, pay. Get in and maybe never get out." 
</P>
<P>
 The intense 3 1/2-hour session began with a report released by the city Monday 
questioning the size of previously defined landslide.  
</P>
<P>
 The report, by Perry Ehling, a South Pasadena engineering geologist, and Bing 
Yen, an Irvine geotechnical engineer, said the slide area appeared smaller than 
other geologists had concluded. Ehling and Yen recommended that at least some 
of the residents be allowed to stabilize their land as necessary and begin 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous 45-day ban expired on Tuesday, and city staff had recommended that 
the council consider extending the moratorium 10 1/2 months, depending on what 
transpired at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuilding effort screeched to a halt last month when Geofirm, a Laguna 
Beach consulting firm hired by the city, reported the ancient landslide was 
under about two dozen Mystic Hills properties, including 14 incinerated in the 
October blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Geofirm said 38 properties could be directly or indirectly affected and 
recommended an area-wide stabilization project, which property owners would 
have had to pay for. An Irvine geological firm, Leighton & Associates Inc., 
confirmed Geofirm's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 But many lot owners expressed doubt that an ancient landslide poses a present 
danger and some even questioned its existence, prompting the city to hire two 
resident-endorsed geologists to give a third opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 That report threw into question the existence, or at least the size, of the 
tear-shaped landslide described by Geofirm. Ehling said small, ancient 
landslides probably exist in the northern portion of the area outlined by 
Geofirm but that he doubted the larger slide exists. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommended further studies be done to determine the southern boundaries of 
the slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's doubtful that the large slide that has been shown there actually 
exists, but we still have a lot of additional work to be done to find out if my 
suspicion is correct or not . . . particularly in the southern half," Ehling 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystic Hills residents, who have been battered by bad news of late, welcomed 
what one called the "extremely positive aspects of the report." Polly Sloan, 
president of the Mystic Hills Ancient Landslide Committee, said property owners 
met Monday night to discuss the latest findings and plan their strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents also successfully persuaded the council Tuesday night to drop 
the idea of forming an assessment district to pay for the $1-million 
restabilization project recommended by Geofirm. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council voted 4 to 0 to allow private geotechnical consultants to 
devise solutions for individual lots. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be a bitter victory for residents in the most unstable areas, since 
city officials have said that without the support of an assessment district, 
some individual property owners may have to pay $100,000 to steady their land.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Lida Lenney had to leave before the vote.

DEBORAH EIDSON HAS GONE FROM ANGUISHED VICTIM OF DIABETIC BLINDNESS TO 
CONFIDENT PARENT AND WIFE. NOW SHE'LL COMFORT THOSE FACING TRAUMA.; GUIDING 
OTHERS IN CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deborah Eidson has been married for eight years but has never seen her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has she seen her two sandy-haired daughters, whose pictures fill the walls 
of her living room and who have known as long as they can remember that their 
mother is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom is blind," announced Danielle, 6. She and her sister Cayla, who is 2 
1/2, rely on touch and sound almost as much as their mother does, guiding her 
by hand and slapping the seat when they want her to sit. They know already not 
to hold something up and say, "Look, mommy, look!" 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Danielle summed up her mother's condition. "It's like electricity," 
she told Eidson. "You have lights in your eyes, but the lights are turned off." 
</P>
<P>
 The lights went out in Eidson's eyes in 1981, when she was 23. A diabetic 
since birth, she knew blindness was a distant threat, but she never thought it 
would happen to her. Then she started seeing black dots -- "floaters" according 
to her ophthalmologist -- and within eight months she went from having perfect 
vision to being totally blind. 
</P>
<P>
 She never thought she would marry or be a mother. After a childhood spent in 
and out of comas, the near-fatal labor of giving birth to her daughter, and 
kidney failure, she managed to adopt a second child. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Eidson, who has risen above great obstacles, will be a lifeline for 
others facing crisis when she finishes training to be a city of Orange 
coordinator for Red Cross disaster services. 
</P>
<P>
 She was drawn to the volunteer role because it's something she can share with 
her husband, Rick, who has been active with the Red Cross for years. It's 
natural for her to comfort others; she can understand the emotions of fire and 
accident victims who find their lives turned upside down, and suddenly having 
to trust strangers for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Eidson knows well how the vulnerability of disaster victims can scar them for 
life. She is still angry with the ophthalmologist who told her bluntly and 
without compassion one day in 1981 that she was going blind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sent me completely into a mental case," she recalled. "From there I just 
went downhill. That doctor, I wish he could know what that did to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Eidson wishes she had spent her last months of sight driving up 
and down the coast, savoring her freedom before turning her Volkswagen Bug over 
to her sister, soaking in the last sunsets she would be able to see. Instead, 
she largely stayed in her room, crying, drugged on Valium and Codeine. Her 
weight dropped to 72 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 That state carried over into her first weeks at Anaheim's Braille Institute, 
which would give her the skills to regain as much of her previous independence 
as she could. Just learning how to walk and orient herself in the dark, along 
with learning to read and write in Braille, would take months. Mastery would 
take years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrible for me," she said of those first weeks at the institute. "I 
would just sit there crying all day long. Then I took myself off all the 
medication by myself. . . . I started to enjoy it after a while. I saw other 
people had dealt with this and went on with life." 
</P>
<P>
 Going on with life meant relearning all the mundane chores that make up a day. 
One time she couldn't find her way out of a square-shaped shower and had to sit 
on the floor until the panic subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the little things," she said when asked what she feared losing. "I 
never thought, 'Boy, I'll never be a world-famous doctor now!' I was washing 
dishes one night and I wondered how I would be able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Eidson now washes dishes and maneuvers around the house with arms 
outstretched, trusting that her daughters have followed orders and kept their 
toys out of her step. That kind of trust is relatively easy for her. Trusting 
in strangers is harder. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her first dangerous experiences came when she was learning to navigate 
the streets and sidewalks with her Seeing Eye dog, Kashmir. The sidewalk led to 
a freeway on-ramp and, suddenly, she heard cars honking and felt the wind as 
they whizzed by. She stopped, paralyzed with fear. "I was shaking and I just 
stood there crying," she said. "A family in a station wagon stopped and I got 
in. Even with a family, I probably shouldn't have done that. That was a lot of 
trust for me." 
</P>
<P>
 There was also the time a man came to fix the plumbing and she felt such 
ominous feelings from him that she called a neighbor to come over. Even more 
unnerving is having to trust others to watch her kids. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, an alarm box lets her know when one of the children has opened the 
front door, the only door in the house that leads to a yard that is not gated. 
The same box also serves as a security alarm at night, a mixed blessing when 
her husband, a software engineer, is on one of his business trips that can last 
several weeks. She has called 911 more than once when she could not pinpoint a 
noise, and it is one of her worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I wonder if I really want to know if someone comes in," she said with a 
laugh. "If somebody did come in, what would I do? I just got to the point where 
I can say, 'It's in God's hands.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her fears now center on her children's future. "I worry about social things," 
she said. "I want them into Scouting and ballet and my husband has to work, so 
I know it will be up to me to get them places. I don't want them to have a 
restricted childhood because of my restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, she added, she keeps the worry to a minimum. She runs the household 
with the help of her Braille writer, which resembles an old-fashioned manual 
typewriter, and a Braille device that prints out plastic labels for cassettes, 
books and food jars. 
</P>
<P>
 Eidson said she has always been a strong, rebellious woman. She had a baby 
even though the doctors told her it might kill her and the baby would suffer 
abnormalities. She refused to write a letter -- to explain her fitness as a 
blind mother -- to the one adoption agency that would consider her. "I thought 
I should be able to do it like anyone else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she found, through open adoption, a birth mother who was acquainted with a 
blind woman who was raising a child, and thus felt confident of entrusting 
Eidson with Cayla when the girl was 3 days old. 
</P>
<P>
 Her "weak spells," as she calls them, overcome her about every six months. 
Then her husband helps her recount all the good things she has in her life. But 
what really does it, she said, was getting on the county bus service for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone limited to a wheelchair or facing other mobility limits will sit next 
to her and she thinks, "At least I can walk," she said. "That always pulls me 
right out of it."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: AUDITOR'S CANDIDATE DEFEATED -- BY 1 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite one candidate's demand for a recount, the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday formally certified the 113,866 ballots cast in the June 
7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Ventura accountant Scott Weiss one vote shy of making the runoff 
for the county auditor-controller.And it leaves him five days to decide whether 
to put up $10,000 of his own money for a recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said he could also choose to sue the county. "I'm not going to do 
anything but take the Independence Day weekend and think about it," Weiss said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final appeal to supervisors, Weiss' campaign treasurer argued that legal 
precedent bound the county to look at 274 "overvotes" -- ballots where voters 
punched more than one hole for the auditor-controller race. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases where the second hole is punched for a write-in candidate, but no 
name is written, these ballots have been considered valid in other elections, 
argued campaign treasurer Mark L. Goldenson. He cited a 1987 court decision and 
a 1984 case when Ventura County did a recount of the overvotes. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel James McBride said the law neither requires nor forbids the 
counting of overvotes. But the county voter registrar, as a policy, does not 
count the ballots and the county's computer program is not set up to handle 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, finding the 274 faulty cards would require culling through all the 
ballots cast in the county races, said Assistant Registrar Bruce Bradley. 
County officials would then have to proceed with a full recount, costing $6,700 
to $10,000. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY'S PIER TO REOPEN ON SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ramon Cedros has a routine he follows when the temperature rises: He drives to 
Seal Beach, plunges into the ocean for a swim and dries off with a long stroll 
along the city's boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 But for more than a month now, Cedros' routine has been altered in the 
aftermath of the Seal Beach Pier fire, which forced the closure of the historic 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The boardwalk is scheduled to reopen Saturday, to the relief of beach-goers 
like Cedros and Main Street merchants who rely on the pier to attract summer 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is real beach weather . . . but it's not the same with the pier like 
this," said Cedros, 29, of Long Beach, as he watched work crews replace burned 
wood planks with new lumber. "It will be nice to see the end (of the pier) 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Those sentiments are shared by merchants who hope the reopening will lure 
crowds down to the Main Street business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach business leaders said that many restaurants, bars and specialty 
shops on the street have reported steady business in recent weeks. They 
attributed the strong sales in part to the heat, which has drawn visitors to 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every business is affected by the weather," said Stan Anderson, president of 
the Seal Beach Business Assn. and owner of Coach's Sports Grill on Pacific 
Coast Highway. "The better the weather, the better the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Added John Baker, owner of the Nip n' Stuff Liquor Store on Main Street: 
"People have noticed a slight increase (in business) with the warm weather." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and merchants hope sales will pick up even more when the pier 
reopens in time for the Fourth of July holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is sure how many people have decided to stay away from Seal Beach 
because of the pier closure. Anderson and others speculated that some visitors 
might cut their trips to the city short if they cannot spend time on the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the perception that the pier is something that draws people to the 
city . . . and is helpful to the businesses," said City Manager Jerry L. 
Bankston. 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants hope to rebound from last year's flat summer season, which was 
blamed on unusually mild weather conditions. While some restaurants reported 
little change in sales last summer, other Main Street stores said business was 
off as much as 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to close the pier once again in the fall for a second and final 
phase of repairs. The May 21 fire, which temporarily trapped more than 100 
people at the end of the boardwalk, caused about $350,000 in damage. No one was 
injured. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STORM IS NAMED ASSISTANT SHERIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Capt. Doug Storm, a 21-year department veteran, has 
been promoted to assistant sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Storm is currently commander of the Regional Narcotics Suppression Program and 
will replace Assistant Sheriff Walter Fath, who is retiring, Sheriff Brad Gates 
announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Storm started with the Sheriff's Department in 1973 as a jail deputy and 
worked through the ranks in the investigative and operations divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently transferred from his post as the south Orange County operations 
commander, where he developed law enforcement contracts with Mission Viejo, 
Dana Point, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Hills and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Fath, who will be leaving the department at the end of the current county 
budget process, developed the sheriff's South County substation in Laguna 
Niguel. After he was promoted to captain in 1975, Fath commanded the patrol and 
records divisions. He was promoted to assistant sheriff in 1981.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COLLEGE WORKERS PROTEST STALEMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of Moorpark College secretaries and custodians took simultaneous breaks 
from their duties Tuesday morning to protest the yearlong stalemate in contract 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 of the college's 160 classified employees held a "unity break" 
outside the administration office for about 15 minutes Tuesday in an attempt to 
spur college officials to offer them more money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Community College District has about 360 classified 
employees at its three campuses who have been working without a contract since 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Union negotiators are asking for a 2% pay raise that would cost about 
$180,000, but college district officials say they cannot afford that much 
because state funding appropriations have not yet been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the district approved a 1% pay raise for the faculty, an 
amount that will cost the district about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But classified union representatives claim their members are losing money by 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inflation has been 3%, so over three years their real income has been cut 
about 10%," said Gregory Cross of the Service Employees International Union 
Local 535. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've actually had a pay cut and their work load is higher because there 
are fewer employees to do the same amount of work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin said the district is unable to discuss details 
about any pay raise until state funding levels are more firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't know whether or not we can afford anything until our budget is 
finalized, and that won't happen until we receive notification from Sacramento 
about the budget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is facing a budget shortfall of $3 million for the upcoming 
fiscal year, which begins Friday. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PLAN FOR GOLDEN OAK PARK TAKES ROOT

 Russ Goodenough has a vision. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to plant a towering oak tree sculpture, painted gold, atop a marble 
pedestal on Fireworks Hill, the distinctive, flat-topped ridge in the center of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to surround the sculpture with a bed of flowers spelling out the 
city's name in vibrant blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants to put a campfire pit on the hilltop, and a rustic amphitheater, 
small lake and picture boards pointing out the landmarks visible from each 
vista. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Goodenough has the city's backing to pursue his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 5-0 vote last week, council members granted Goodenough permission to 
create a citizens committee to draft plans for a Golden Oak Park on Fireworks 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the parcel earlier this year so that council members could 
better control development on the graded, three-acre top and on the steep 
slopes, which slant into the campus of the former city hall at 401 W. Hillcrest 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is a park created entirely by private donations and volunteerism," 
said Goodenough, who called for a monthly community work day to galvanize 
residents to clean up the property. 
</P>
<P>
 He also suggested establishing Golden Oak Park Foundation with an endowment to 
pay for ongoing maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be a delightful place for a park," resident Harry Evry said, 
offering to join the newly established committee. "I thank Russ for his poetic 
vision." STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 Simi Valley police Tuesday were searching for a man who held up a Vons 
supermarket clerk at gunpoint and then fled with several hundred dollars in 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The man entered the Vons market at 2204 Tapo St. about 11 p.m. Monday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He approached the cashier, brandished a gun and demanded money from the 
register, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cashier gave the man several hundred dollars, and he fled the store on 
foot. No shots were fired and no injuries were reported, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber was described as a white, 25- to 30 -year-old man with black hair, 
wearing a purple shirt and gray pants, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives on Tuesday were looking for more witnesses. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

<P>
 Nearly two months after the last candy apples and hot dogs were sold, proceeds 
from Conejo Valley Days have been divided among several local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Money from food sales went to the service clubs and school groups that staffed 
each concession booth.But Hospice of the Conejo, the Thousand Oaks Library and 
the Conejo Valley Unified School District each received money without ever 
selling any food. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days' two candidates for grand marshal raised more than $10,000 
apiece through dance-a-thons, golf tournaments and other events -- and then 
emptied their coffers to worthy causes. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning candidate, Maria Prescott, donated her war chest to Hospice of the 
Conejo. The second-place finisher, Denise Reed, divided her funds among the 
Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce, the school district and the library. "We 
need the library badly," Reed said, "and I know our tax dollars don't cover 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed will present the final installment of her donation, a $1,000 check, to 
the library's restoration committee during a brief ceremony at the Chamber of 
Commerce at 4:30 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 The library lost its ceiling, carpet and more than 10,000 books in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. Deputy Director Steve Brogden estimated that it would cost at least 
$300,000 to replace the damaged volumes, most of which came from the children's 
collection. STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Farmers' Market will move across the street starting July 7, 
with 60 produce and flower vendors setting up booths in the Village Square 
Center on Moorpark Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced from Janss Mall because of construction, the farmers' market will 
move permanently to the center between Hillcrest and Brazil streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The market will retain its regular hours: 4 to 8 p.m. Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the new location is more visible and offers more parking, farmers' 
market manager Karen Wetzel predicted that sales would pick up after the move. 
"It's really exciting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wetzel noted that when the Ventura Farmers' Market moved in 1991, vendors 
lost many faithful customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales dropped 15% after the move and stayed depressed for as long as six 
months. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; OFFICIALS PUSH DRIVE FOR 'SCENIC 
HIGHWAY' 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still pushing for official recognition of the Conejo Valley's roadside vistas, 
Thousand Oaks council members on Tuesday agreed to seek new allies in their 
campaign to get a stretch of the Ventura Freeway declared scenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Alex Fiore will ask state and county officials to join him in lobbying 
the California Department of Transportation for "state scenic highway" status 
late next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks can already count on support from local politicians in Agoura 
Hills, Westlake Village and Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 The four cities have filed a joint application urging Caltrans to designate a 
21-mile strip of the Ventura Freeway as scenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a designation would bring each city a few blue plaques and maybe some 
attention. But the biggest boon, officials say, would be in boosting Agoura 
Hills' efforts to get rid of the towering signs that now dot that city's 
segment of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has already twice rejected scenic highway applications from 
individual cities and coalitions in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans' Departmental Traffic Advisory Committee has set another hearing 
for July 29, and local officials hope they will finally prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to keep plugging along with it," Thousand Oaks Planning 
Director Phil Gatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 To enhance their application, Thousand Oaks council members on Tuesday agreed 
to request support from the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, state Sen. 
Cathie Wright and Assemblyman Nao Takasugi. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's field director, Bill Blankenship, said he believes the senator will 
back the four-city effort. STEPHANIE SIMON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY ACTS TO LURE MOVIE, TV CREWS

 Roll 'em!  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County supervisors gave final approval Tuesday to funding of a film 
office that would attempt to bring more television and motion picture 
productions to county locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's unanimous vote came as actress Melissa Gilbert was across the 
street in Santa Ana filming a television courtroom drama at the Old Orange 
County Courthouse. Gilbert, who is starring in "A Touch of Truth," said she was 
pleased to hear of the county's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, neat," Gilbert said Tuesday during a break in filming. "Any place has a 
chance of attracting business as long as there is cooperation. A lot of actors 
live south of Los Angeles in places like Newport Beach and they might find it 
easier to get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who initiated the drive to increase the area's 
profile in Hollywood, said Orange County has been "missing out" on big economic 
opportunities by failing to market its beaches, parks and cities as film 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimated that film crews spent $250,000 in Orange County last year, 
compared to $27 million in San Diego, $20 million in Tucson and $17 million in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's attempt at staking a stronger claim to film business will start 
with paying for office space at the Orange County Chamber of Commerce. The 
county will provide up to $242,502 over three years, with additional funding 
coming from the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristi Silverberg, who has been involved in the initial planning, will work as 
the first office director at an annual salary of about $61,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "You only need to look across the street to see what this can do," Vasquez 
said, nodding toward the old courthouse on Santa Ana Boulevard. "That film crew 
has been on location for seven days, staying in our hotels and eating in our 
restaurants. It's this kind of business that we need to attract on a more 
consistent basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the old courthouse parking lot was jammed with production trucks and 
dressing trailers while lighting equipment was spread across its grounds. The 
historic courthouse has been a popular location in past years for production 
crews, but officials said the county has never attempted to market itself as 
other communities have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not hustled for business, but we can change that trend today," 
Vasquez said. "Great days are ahead if we pursue this aggressively." On

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; HIKE IN COMMERCIAL TRASH FEES TO VARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trash collection fees for Briggeman Disposal's commercial customers will go up 
next month under a proposal unanimously approved by the City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 The increase, approved Monday, will vary by amount, depending on the size of 
the trash bins customers are using and how often the trash is picked up. Fees 
will range from $87.91 a month for two-cubic-yard trash bins picked up once a 
week to $406 for trash in four-cubic-yard bins collected six times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the company's 615 commercial customers use three-cubic-yard 
bins, which are picked up once a week. They will see a $5 increase in their 
monthly bills to $99.93. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rates, which will take effect July 1, are intended to pay for the cost 
of a recycling program for commercial customers, officials said. There is no 
increase in residential rates. 
</P>
<P>
 George Briggeman, the company's chief executive officer, said that the rate 
increase will help finance the estimated $150,000 his company will spend for 
using a material recovery facility.  
</P>
<P>
 The facility separates recyclable materials from those that go to landfills.  
</P>
<P>
 But he said the service is expensive. Consolidated Volume Transporters, which 
operates a recovery facility in Anaheim, charges $40 a ton for sorting the 
trash, twice the amount charged for disposing the trash in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the recovery facility would enable the city to comply with state law 
that requires cities to reduce the amount of trash dumped in landfills by 25% 
by 1995, according to Assistant City Manager Gerard Goedhart. By the year 2000, 
the state requires 50% diversion, Goedhart said.  
</P>
<P>
 Commercial users account for 75% of the trash the city generates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A voluntary commercial recycling program that began last year failed. 
Briggeman said just seven businesses took part in the program, accounting for 
only 6% of what the city recycles. He said residents recycle about 25% of their 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get the response we expected," said Briggeman. "People felt it was 
not worth their time." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; SCHOOL DISTRICT OKS $135-MILLION 
BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $135-million budget for the 1994-95 school year was unanimously approved 
this week by Capistrano Unified School District trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget for the 32,000-student district includes the opening of five new 
elementary schools in September and the expansion of Aliso Niguel High School 
to include seniors for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will greatly relieve the student population at many of our existing 
elementary schools," district spokeswoman Jacqueline Price said. "A school like 
Crown Valley Elementary, for instance, which has always been our biggest 
school, will see its enrollment drop from 1,259 students to a little more than 
600." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the new schools will open in Laguna Niguel, and one each in Mission 
Viejo, San Clemente and Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, for the first time, the Capistrano district will allow parents 
to send their children to the school of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, two schools -- the new Malcom Elementary School in the Beacon 
Hill area of Laguna Niguel and Aliso Niguel High School -- have waiting lists 
and students will have to attend the school of their second choice, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final school budget is contingent on the future state budget, however, 
which has not been passed by the Legislature, Price said.  
</P>
<P>
 "By state law we have to adopt our budget by June 30, but the funding is still 
uncertain," Price said. "That makes it difficult for us to plan. We'll have to 
go back in the fall and make some adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 The district receives about $120 million of its funding from the state so "you 
can see we rely on the state for the vast majority of our money," Price said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; 10 POLICE VOLUNTEERS TO BEGIN PATROL DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During this time of municipal budget crunches and heightened concern about 
public safety, volunteers with the new Community Action Patrol are taking to 
the streets as "extra eyes and ears" for the Brea Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten volunteers, ranging in age from 20 to 70, recently graduated from a 
10-week training program organized by Officer Kenneth J. Bradshaw, a background 
investigator for the Police Department. Although the program does not 
officially get underway until the Fourth of July weekend, volunteer Robert Rush 
has already been pressed into duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush performed traffic control for six hours during the Carbon Canyon brush 
fire that scorched more than 800 acres and threatened the Olinda Village 
community Saturday. The 66-year-old Hughes Aircraft Company retiree, who has a 
background in hazardous waste management, said he "came running" when he heard 
applications were being accepted for the patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt it was time for me to volunteer," said Rush, who served as a 
combat medic during the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 Another patrol member is Sal Gambina, 65, who served on the Brea City Council 
for eight years starting in 1974. Gambina said that with the city facing budget 
cuts, it's time for residents to come forward to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left the council, I told the Police Department I'd support them in 
anything they do," Gambina said. "So we all do our part. They have always done 
a good job. It's time the citizens did their part too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Action Patrol is similar to a volunteer program the department 
began last year in neighboring Yorba Linda, which contracts police services 
from Brea. Based on the success of this initial program, City Manager Frank 
Benest and then-Police Chief Donald L. Forkus asked Bradshaw to start a patrol 
in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Glenn G. Parker said it's exciting "to see so many willing to volunteer 
so much time." Action Patrol members must perform at least 16 hours of service 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many volunteers within Brea, and this is just one more extension 
of that," Parker said. "It will give us better (police) service, not eliminate 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worked real well in Yorba Linda for the last year," Parker added. "Our 
Police Department has just been very innovative." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw originally received 44 applications for Brea's Community Action 
Patrol. He then began a series of background checks -- which were "just a few 
clicks below what I would have done for a police officer," he said -- and began 
the monthly training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 volunteers who completed the program are now certified in first aid and 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, have gone on ride-alongs with city police 
officers and have completed "sit-alongs" in the police dispatch center. They 
have also learned about graffiti, gangs, traffic control, emergency 
preparedness and even bomb identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will assist the department by checking homes and businesses to 
assure they are locked, help with traffic and crowd control, and take on 
clerical and front-counter duties at the police station. Bradshaw, who also 
trained the 12 Yorba Linda patrol members, said volunteers' responsibilities 
will be expanded over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see in the future they will be a very formidable part of the department," 
said Bradshaw, who continues to train the volunteers on a monthly basis. The 
next session will focus on suspicious activity in fire-hazard areas, a timely 
topic given the "extremely high" fire danger in the brush-covered hills near 
Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be an excellent, excellent program," Bradshaw said.

$50,000 a year in new revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the plan on a 4-1 vote earlier this month, with 
Councilman Greg Smith opposing the measure. Smith claimed that shelters with 
ads do not fit the look of Irvine. He compared such shelters to billboards, 
which, he noted, are prohibited in most parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members said the shelter plan would benefit rather than 
blight the city. They pointed out that shelter advertising would only be 
allowed in commercial and industrial areas like the Irvine Business Complex and 
Spectrum. The ads would not be allowed in residential-area bus shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan approved by the council calls for the formation of a committee to 
decide on a uniform design for the shelters. The committee will be made up of 
city officials, residents and the manufacturer of the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shelters will include benches and trash containers. Some will also 
feature pay telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members suggested banning tobacco and alcohol advertising on the 
shelters. But the city attorney reported that such a ban would be difficult to 
enforce under current laws. Still, council members urged city officials to 
select advertisers judiciously. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CONSULTANT TO STUDY EUCLID STREET TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A consultant has been hired to suggest improvements for an already heavily 
traveled stretch of Euclid Street to accommodate increasing traffic on the 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman LaurannCook said traffic on Euclid Street is only expected to 
grow worse in coming years. "Fountain Valley seems to be a thoroughfare for a 
number of commuters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week agreed to spend nearly $300,000 in Measure M and 
city redevelopment money to hire the engineering firm of NBS/Lowry Inc. of 
Irvine. The company will study a 2 1/2-mile portion of Euclid Street from Ellis 
Avenue near the San Diego Freeway to just north of Edinger Avenue, the city's 
northern border. Residents expressed some opposition to hiring the consultant. 
One said the large expenditure is not justified. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wayne S. Osborne, director of public works, said that the consultant's 
services are necessary and will focus on specific improvements that could be 
made to accommodate existing traffic as well as future traffic increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the study will provide them with the information they 
need to make decisions about improvements to Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30,000 vehicles use Euclid Street each day, Osborne said. However, he 
said, the street is currently below capacity for a four-lane thoroughfare, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been past discussion of widening the street to six lanes to handle 
additional traffic expected in coming years. But some public opposition has 
accompanied the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Euclid Street's intersections with Talbert and Warner avenues are currently 
plagued by heavy traffic that delay motorists' progress, Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public meetings with residents who live along Euclid Street will be held 
during the study process, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of the study, which will include public comments and 
recommendations to the council, is expected to be completed in late December. 
An environmental impact report will be required if the council adopts any of 
the recommended improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Then remaining portion of the study by NBS/Lowry Inc., including plans for 
reconstruction of the street and right-of-way acquisition, would follow and be 
completed by July, 1995, Osborne said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; GRADE-MANIPULATION COMMITTEE CREATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brea Olinda Unified School District is creating a committee to draft 
policies in order to prevent student grade changing without teacher approval, 
and will hire an auditor to review past practices in which grades were changed 
by former guidance counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was rocked recently when it was revealed that more than 360 
grades of Brea Olinda High School students had been changed to simple "pass" 
notations instead of the traditional A, B, C, D or F. District officials said 
some students' transcripts also were altered so they could receive double 
credit for taking a course. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said former counselors were responsible for the grade changes in an 
effort to boost student grade-point averages to increase their chances to 
graduate and get accepted at competitive colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators said they knew of the grade switching last fall but did not 
tell the school board until May when the teachers union filed a grievance. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed committee, which will include three school board members, the 
Brea Olinda Teachers Assn. president, the high school's vice principal and a 
classified employee, is expected to come up with policy recommendations before 
school begins in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Lynn Doucher called the grade changing "so serious that the Board 
of Education should be actively involved in resolving the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, district administrators hired an auditor to investigate the 
grade changes. The auditor, identified only as a registrar from another Orange 
County school district, rejected the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Todd A. Spitzer said he was not told that an auditor had been 
hired. He convinced fellow board members that the board should hire the auditor 
and not the district's administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be in the know on who is hired," Spitzer said. "This is not going 
to be a closed-door process. It's got to be open. . . . We need to know what 
happened and how can we better it." 
</P>
<P>
 The board scheduled a meeting for Thursday to discuss who might be hired and 
what the auditor will investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurry Bishop, president of the teachers union, said he didn't understand the 
need for an auditor. He said anyone can check the computer in which all 
transcripts are stored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there were grades changed. Yes, class titles did change and, yes, 
duplicate credits were granted. But when this error was grieved by our 
contractual grievance process, those errors were addressed, and for the most 
part, correction began," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To uphold the reputation of this district, I think someone outside the 
district should do it (the audit) and no one in this district would be 
qualified," Trustee Frank Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to build in the safeguard that everybody will say that the district 
did everything it could to ensure an independent audit without being influenced 
by anyone in this district," Spitzer said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COUNCIL APPROVES YOUTH HOSTEL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overriding the Planning Commission, the City Council has approved the plans of 
two young Australian entrepreneurs to open an international youth hostel in the 
Cannery Village area. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 2 Monday night to allow Andrew Grace and Philip Boston 
to renovate an empty, two-story office building at 430 32nd St. They will turn 
it into a 40-bed, $15-per-night hostel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission had turned down the hostel proposal last month on 
grounds of inadequate parking and bathroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that denial, the hostel investors have arranged to lease a lot at 424 
32nd St. for additional parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that ought to be given a chance to work," said Councilman 
John C. Cox Jr., who mentioned that his daughter had stayed at youth hostels in 
Europe. "There never will be a perfect place for it. It's always, 'Not in my 
back yard.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The investors say the hostel will give the local economy a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dakota, a Newport Beach resident who is helping market the project to 
international travelers, said visitors spend less money on accommodations but 
spend more time enjoying the local attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of adjacent properties petitioned the council Monday not to approve the 
project. They said they don't want groups of rowdy young people hanging about 
and frequenting local bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is all kinds of destructive activity associated with those bars," said 
Roy Jackson, who owns several nearby office buildings. "We already can't get 
police down here to do enforcement and they're adding another item that will 
need enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Jean H. Watt and Phil Sansone voted against the proposal, and 
Councilman John W. Hedges was absent. Watt argued that the plan to house 40 
people with only three toilets and half a dozen showers was "too much for the 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace told the council that hostels usually attract college-educated people 
aged 22 to 35 who want to meet people of other cultures and are not partying 
people looking for a cheap hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Danish traveler Caren Jacobsen told the council Monday night, "I didn't come 
12,000 kilometers to go to a nightclub." 
</P>
<P>
 Dakota said he expects the hostel to be ready for visitors by late August. The 
nearest international youth hostel is in Huntington Beach. The Newport Beach 
hostel will be connected by shuttle to dozens of hostels along the California 
coast.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SCHOOL DISTRICT PICKS AGENCY TO RUN SEARCH

<TEXT>
<P>
 The governing board of the Santa Ana Unified School District has chosen 
Educational Search Services to recruit a superintendent to replace Rudy M. 
Castruita, who will leave the district near the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 4 to 1 last week to award the $14,500 contract to the 
group.Trustees Robert W. Balen, Audrey Yamagata-Noji, Rosemarie Avila and Sal 
Mendoza supported the move. Trustee Tom Chaffee opposed it, board secretary 
Georgia Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Educational Search Services, which is run by the California School Boards 
Assn., has helped more than 100 school districts recruit new superintendents 
over the past few years, said Don Champlin, assistant superintendent for 
personnel services for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The group and its chief consultant Richard Montgomery will be responsible for 
developing criteria to screen candidates, advertising for the job, performing 
reference checks and helping negotiate a contract with the winning candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent oversees about 3,600 full-time and 500 part-time employees. 
The job pays $124,000 a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The search may take take about four months to complete, Champlin said. JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; L.A. JUDGE REJECTS ORANGE UNIFIED SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge in Los Angeles has rejected a lawsuit filed by Orange 
Unified School District, which intended to wrest control of adult education 
classes from the Rancho Santiago College District. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Joseph Kalin on Monday rejected a suit that would have stripped the 
college district of its ability to provide adult-education classes on behalf of 
the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The college district has offered those classes on behalf of Orange Unified for 
22 years, but school district officials now want their district to provide the 
courses, in part because they feel Rancho Santiago doesn't offer a sufficient 
variety of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in May, was the culmination of a long-running battle over 
which district is best equipped to provide adult education. 
</P>
<P>
 College Chancellor Vivian Blevins praised the judge's decision as "a clear 
victory." She noted that it could be a short-lived one if Orange Unified 
officials decide to refile the suit, adding, "this is Stage 1 of what could be 
a 30-stage process." 
</P>
<P>
 Blevins said the suit was thrown out because the judge felt the dispute should 
be settled by state officials and not the courts. Gretchen Hanson, acting 
superintendent for Orange Unified, said she did not know whether the school 
district would file a new suit but that it remains a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said the school district wants to provide the classes and that the 
judge's decision is "a stumbling block we'll try to (overcome)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit demanded that Rancho Santiago officials rescind their decision to 
offer certain adult-education classes for the 1994-95 school year and transfer 
those programs to Orange Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials have alleged that the college district is offering 
those classes and recouping state dollars without a formal agreement required 
by the state Education Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Blevins said that college district attempts to discuss that mutual agreement 
have been repeatedly rebuffed by Orange Unified staff and its board of 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Orange County Community College District also was named as a 
defendant in the suit. That district was sued by the Placentia-Yorba Linda 
Unified School District. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY ADOPTS BUDGET WITH NO NEW TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has balanced its budget for the next fiscal year without creating new 
taxes, making drastic cuts in services or increasing fees significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week adopted a $23.6-million general-fund budget for 
1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was able to balance the budget by taking a number of measures, 
which included continuing a hiring freeze of 15 jobs. None of the jobs are in 
the area of public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council also approved creating a $15 fee to offset police 
costs in processing repossessed cars and increased fees by $10 to $160 a team 
for volleyball and basketball recreation programs. Mayor John J. Collins said 
that the fee increases will cover administrative costs for these services. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to use city reserves to pay nearly $500,000 in added 
payroll expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved the city's water budget, which is separate. Revenues 
are expected to be about $5.6 million with expenditures projected at about $6.1 
million. The shortfall will be offset with a surplus expected for the current 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Wayne S. Osborne, director of public works, said that steps have 
been taken to reduce the city's cost of buying imported water. Osborne said the 
city buys imported water in the winter instead of summer, which reduces the 
total cost by $150,000. DEBRA CANO

LA HABRA RESIDENTS APPLAUD PANEL REJECTION OF BIKINI BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 elated residents gave the Planning Commission a standing ovation 
this week when it unanimously voted not to allow a bikini bar in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Smith proposed operating a nonsmoking bar featuring bikini-clad dancers 
and servers for customers 18 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he filed an appeal Tuesday, hoping the City Council will overturn the 
Planning Commission's decision and allow him to open La Habra Polo Grounds in a 
local shopping center. The center, which houses a Pic 'N Save store, hair and 
nail salons and restaurants, is on the northeast corner of La Habra and Harbor 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Pamela Shurilla told the Planning Commission: "This is a community's 
outcry against a type of pornography. This is about virtues and about morals." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Davis, 70, said she cheered when the commission rejected the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for the good of the community," she said. "Our city is already 
crumbling. We don't need a bar like this to tear it down." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Gene LaBlond said the proposed bikini bar "did not 
belong in that particular area, which is more of a community- and 
family-oriented center not suited for a 'gentlemen's club.' " 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said hundreds of homes, two elementary schools, a middle school 
and a high school are within a mile of the proposed bar. Many residents said 
they did not want their children to walk by Smith's bar on their way to or from 
home.  
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Michael Collins said Smith refused to comply with a number of 
conditions, which included upgrading lighting in the parking lot, keeping the 
dance stage 11 feet from the bar and planting large trees along property lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith would not respond to residents' or the Planning Commission's concerns, 
citing his attorney's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider Smith's appeal at an upcoming meeting, 
officials said.

ATTORNEYS SAY TEENS WERE PAWNS IN SCHEME TO KILL TAY; COURTS: ROLES OF ABRAHAM 
ACOSTA AND KIRN KIM ARE DOWNPLAYED, BUT PROSECUTOR COUNTERS THEY WERE WELL 
AWARE OF THE PLOT. JURY IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN DELIBERATIONS TODAY. 
</P>

<P>
 One teen-ager who acted as a lookout and another who landed the first blow 
should be spared murder convictions in the 1992 New Year's Eve slaying of honor 
student Stuart A. Tay, their attorneys said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park and Kirn Kim, 18, of Fullerton were 
unwitting pawns caught up in a murder scheme hatched by another teen-ager, who 
has since been convicted of orchestrating Tay's death, defense attorneys told 
the Orange County Superior Court jury during closing arguments Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys downplayed their clients' roles in the murder by shifting 
the blame to Robert Chan, 19, of Fullerton, a onetime high school valedictorian 
who was convicted in May of organizing the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Denise Gragg told jurors that Acosta is a mentally 
disabled youth who was "easily led" into participating in what he believed was 
a prank to scare Tay but never believed a murder would take place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robert Chan used Abraham Acosta," Gragg told jurors. "Who better to use than 
someone far below you in maturity and intelligence?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gragg said jurors, who are expected to begin deliberating today, should 
convict Acosta of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Allan H. Stokke asked jurors to find his client guilty only 
of being an accessory to murder after the killing had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokke said Kim considered Chan a "big talker" who bragged about involvement 
in crimes but never actually committed them. Kim also dismissed Chan's talk 
about killing Tay as bragging, and had no idea Tay was being beaten to death 
while Kim waited outside Acosta's home, Stokke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfair, it's not reasonable and it's not just" to convict Kim of murder, 
Stokke said, adding that a murder conviction would be like "killing" the 
defendant. "Don't make Kirn Kim into another victim. . . . We've got enough 
victims of Robert Chan's twisted mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum blasted attempts to portray Kim and 
Acosta as victims, saying they were well aware of and played key roles in a 
sophisticated murder scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta helped dig a grave in his back yard the day before the slaying and 
participated in a rehearsal of the slaying, Rosenblum said. Kim acted as a 
lookout and dumped Tay's sports car in Compton to make it appear Tay had been 
the victim of a carjacking, Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Acosta and Kim truly did not know a murder was underway, Rosenblum told 
jurors, they had an obligation to call police or halt the scheme. Instead, 
Acosta was paid $100 and Kim received $20 -- money Chan took from Tay's wallet, 
Rosenblum told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There comes a point in time where people must be held accountable for the 
choices they make," Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan faces life in prison without parole when he is sentenced this summer. Mun 
Bong Kang, 19, also of Fullerton, pleaded guilty in May and faces the same 
sentence for his role in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The four teens have been prosecuted as adults. A fifth defendant, Charles 
Choe, 18, of Fullerton, was prosecuted as a juvenile after he agreed to testify 
against his former co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants attended Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton. Tay attended 
Foothill High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan and Tay became friends while planning to rob an Anaheim computer-parts 
dealer. Chan later turned on the victim when he feared Tay was a police 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay was beaten unconscious with baseball bats before he was forced to drink 
rubbing alcohol and had his nose and mouth taped shut. He was buried in a 
shallow grave in Acosta's back yard.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing the potential for future conflicts of interest, county Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder removed herself as a director of a local business, 
government and education coalition that she helped to create. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder announced her removal Tuesday before the county Board of Supervisors 
was asked to approve funding for a consultant that would work for the coalition 
known as Partnership 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, 
also coalition board members, abstained from Tuesday's vote, which resulted in 
the hiring of defense-conversion consultant PHH Phantus for the coalition and 
the county.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Habra businessman was convicted Tuesday of five counts of bribing an 
Internal Revenue Service agent in a bid to avoid paying taxes and financial 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury found David Chiang, 41, guilty of paying more than $3,000 in cash to 
agent Mary Kay Pittner. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittner, who notified her superiors as soon as the bribe was offered, accepted 
the money in several installments on instructions from IRS security officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiang offered Pittner $10,000 after learning that she planned to get a court 
order to close down his two fast-food restaurants and take other action for his 
failure to pay $124,000 in back taxes, penalties and interest, Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Nathan J. Hochman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiang actually paid Pittner $3,400 in several installments before his arrest 
on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiang faces a maximum sentence of 75 years in prison and $1.25 million in 
fines.

MAN ARRAIGNED ON 13 MOLESTATION, HARASSMENT COUNTS; HEARING: SHERIFF'S 
DETECTIVES ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE IF DANA POINT SUSPECT IS LINKED TO SIMILAR 
CRIMES LAST YEAR IN CULVER CITY. FREE ON $100,000 BAIL, HE PLEADS NOT GUILTY.

<P>
 Claiming his innocence, Thomas Cimino was arraigned Tuesday on 13 counts of 
child molestation and harassment while Orange County sheriff's detectives were 
trying to determine whether he is linked to similar incidents in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Juan Capistrano man, who is free on $100,000 bail, pleaded not guilty 
to the charges in South County Municipal Court and will face a preliminary 
hearing on July 21. He is accused of terrorizing a Dana Point neighborhood over 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators will meet with Culver City detectives later this week 
and jointly interview child victims in two cases of indecent exposure reported 
there in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City reports caught Orange County investigators' attention because 
of their similarity to the eight incidents in Dana Point allegedly involving 
Cimino. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Dana Point cases, children were lured by a man who asked them to help 
find a lost kitten, then exposed himself to them. One case involved physical 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Culver City reports, victims described a man that fit Cimino's general 
description with a rash on his face. Authorities also said Cimino was living in 
the South Bay area of Los Angeles when the 1993 crimes were committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ken Wheat of Culver City's sex crimes division confirmed Tuesday that 
Orange County officers are interested in the cases in his jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had thought we had someone else ID'd (for the Culver City indecent 
exposures)," Wheat said, "but it could be someone else who is responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by relatives and friends in court Tuesday, Cimino left the talking 
to Santa Ana attorney Paul Wallin. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney assailed a composite drawing used by authorities to identify 
Cimino, saying it bore no resemblance to his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this was a totally irrelevant composite," Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also asserted that the Orange County district attorney's office filed an 
excessive number of charges against Cimino, including for one incident in which 
a man allegedly asked for help finding a kitten, then ran away before the child 
could respond. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Claudia Silbar, said later, "We feel we 
have more than enough evidence to substantiate our charges." 
</P>
<P>
 She said more important than the composite drawing was the identification of 
Cimino by most of the 10 children in the Dana Point incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Another deputy district attorney who asked not to be named said Tuesday that a 
search of Cimino's home yielded "items of clothing with identifiable 
characteristics" described by some of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Included was a sweat shirt and aviator-style sunglasses mentioned by victims, 
all between ages 6 and 10, the deputy district attorney said.

POLICE SEEKING FULLERTON MAN IN GUN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police investigators are searching for a 28-year-old suspect in connection 
with an apparent homicide of a Fullerton man who was found shot in a parking 
lot Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne said Rudy Allen Gomez of Fullerton became a 
suspect in the shooting death after he was involved in an accident in the 
victim's car later that day in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez was taken to UC Irvine Hospital, where he was treated for cuts to his 
face and an injury to his knee. He left the hospital Sunday and has not been 
seen since then, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blood and evidence from the vehicle were not consistent with the minor 
injuries Gomez received from the traffic collision," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of the victim, Robert Andrew Williams, 34, was discovered at 10:46 
a.m. Sunday in the covered parking lot of an office building at 1700 W. Katella 
Ave. It was not known how long the man had been dead, and no witnesses were 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, who Browne said has ties to a Fullerton-area gang, has several tattoos, 
including "Speedy" on his left hand, "FTT" on his neck and "Brown Magic" on his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on Gomez or the shooting is asked to call the Orange 
Police Department hot line at (714) 744-7520. Ask for Detective Desouza.

NAVY YEOMAN COULD GET LIFE IN RAPES, ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Navy yeoman faces life in prison when sentenced Sept. 2 for a crime spree in 
which he committed a series of robberies and sexual assaults, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury on Monday convicted Amos Dwayne 
Stevenson, 22, of kidnaping, robbery, sexual assault and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson was assigned to the mobile mine assembly group at the Seal Beach 
Naval Station and was in the Navy brig in Long Beach for an unrelated assault 
when he was arrested in June, 1993. He is awaiting a Navy administrative 
review, said Navy spokesman Richard Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last attack on Dec. 13, Stevenson ordered two female victims at 
gunpoint to drive him to the Huntington Beach Mall parking lot, where he locked 
one woman in the trunk of the car and raped the other woman in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, Stevenson forced a couple to withdraw money from an 
automated bank teller machine, and in December he sexually assaulted another 
woman after forcing her to withdraw money from a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 A purse belonging to one victim was found at the Seal Beach naval station, and 
investigators used DNA testing to link him to the Huntington Beach rape.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A power failure left 3,351 residents without electricity Tuesday morning, and 
about 300 of them still had no power 14 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The blackout occurred when an underground cable broke at 9:43 a.m., a 
spokesman for San Diego Gas and Electric said. 
</P>
<P>
 Power was restored to homes throughout the day, but by 10:30 p.m., about 10% 
of the homes initially affected still had no electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents complained about having no air conditioning and food thawing in 
their refrigerators, the spokesperson said.

FUTURE OF SAN ONOFRE PLANT DEBATED AT PUBLIC HEARING; UTILITIES: SCE OFFICIALS 
AND WORKERS LINE UP AGAINST THE STATE AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS WHO WANT TO CLOSE 
THE NUCLEAR FACILITY BY 1998. A SECOND MEETING IS TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200 people descended on City Hall on Tuesday for a public hearing to 
determine the fate of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The early arrivals found standing room only, and those outside gleaned what 
they could from the public address system. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was the first of two before an administrative law judge on the 
state's proposal to close the plant by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,500 employees who would lose their jobs are pitted against 
environmentalists and state officials who want the plant shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to understand how one could so easily dismiss the devastation 
that such a loss of jobs would bring," said Scott Diehl, mayor of San Clemente, 
one of many neighboring cities that oppose the closure. Diehl warned against 
"the premature and untimely" closure of San Onofre.  
</P>
<P>
 The Utility Workers Union of America, which has been lobbying to keep the 
plant open, says it infuses more than $250 million into the surrounding 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents include environmentalists who fear a nuclear accident. Before 
the hearing, members of the Alliance for Survival, a Santa Ana-based 
environmental group, staged a demonstration pledging to mount a statewide 
campaign to close San Onofre.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nuclear power has failed on all counts. It's not safe, not cheap and not 
clean," said Marion Pack, executive director of the alliance. "It is time we 
stopped using one of the most dangerous elements known to humankind to do 
something as simple as boil water."  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also argue that the plant costs too much to operate and are urging 
Southern California Edison Co. officials to consider alternative forms of 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think nuclear power plants are uneconomical," said Ira Kalinsky, the 
attorney for the Public Utilities Council, an advocacy group for rate powers. 
"It's cheaper to just shut down the plant and buy energy at market value." 
</P>
<P>
 San Onofre provides 12% of all the electricity to Southern California Edison 
customers, and supporters of closing it say ratepayers would save $1 billion if 
it converted.  
</P>
<P>
 But Brian Katz, a spokesman for San Onofre, said opponents are miscalculating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California Edison's costs are competitive when the calculations are 
done correctly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison officials, which also opposes the closure, say 
converting to natural gas and other types of energy would contribute to 
pollution while nuclear power, they argue, is pollution free.  
</P>
<P>
 The second public hearing will be held at 7:30 tonight at Fullerton High 
School.  
</P>
<P>
 The administrative law judge will present his report to the Public Utilities 
Commission, which is expected to decide the question later this year.

MASSIVE NEWHALL RANCH PROPOSAL SPARKS CONCERNS; DEVELOPMENT: CRITICS FEAR 
TRAFFIC, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FROM PLANNED SANTA CLARITA VALLEY SUBDIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN and DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 30 years ago, they took onion fields and planted a suburb called 
Valencia, at the time the largest subdivision in Los Angeles County history. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Newhall Land & Farming Co. wants to transform a 19-square-mile Santa 
Clarita Valley tract peppered with oil wells and cattle into a community of 
70,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 25,000 homes, 10 schools, six shopping centers and a business 
park, the new development would surpass even the original Valencia project. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be about half the size of the city of Santa Clarita and about three 
times larger than either San Fernando or Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is only the latest of several housing projects around the state that 
are lining up like supertankers at a port, ready to capitalize on the end of 
the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, designed to be built in five phases over a 25-year period, has 
sparked worries about traffic and other environmental impacts. Concern is 
heightened because Southern California's largest remaining wild river, the 
Santa Clara, flows through the site west of Six Flags Magic Mountain and is 
home to two federally endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling Newhall Ranch project would straddle California 126 and fill in 
a five-mile gap of open space between the amusement park and the Ventura County 
line. Ventura County officials fear that the suburban sprawl would eventually 
spill across the line into the bucolic farmlands of the Santa Clara River 
Valley since the developer owns another 15,000 acres there. 
</P>
<P>
 But even environmentalists who oppose the project concede that the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors and at least five other state and federal agencies 
are likely to approve the stack of permits that the developer needs to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Formally announced last week by company officials, the long-anticipated 
project is just beginning to wend its way through a three-year approval process 
in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the development will undoubtedly go through in some form," said Ron 
Bottorff, chairman of Friends of the Santa Clara River. "The best we can do is 
to reduce the impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Working for Newhall Land is its reputation as developer of the carefully 
planned Valencia community, and its assertions that it will do all that it can 
to make Newhall Ranch a model of environmentally sensitive development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did nationwide surveys and we found that people want to live close to 
nature," said James M. Harter, a senior vice president of Newhall Land. "People 
are tired of concrete and urban sprawl." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Ranch would be made up of five villages linked by a network of roads 
the company plans to build, including extensions of Chiquita Canyon Road, Magic 
Mountain Parkway, Valencia Boulevard and San Martinez Grade. Plans also call 
for California 126, which the state Department of Transportation already 
intends to widen to four lanes, to be widened to six lanes along a four-mile 
stretch west of the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has offered to set aside 5,400 acres of open space -- or 45% of 
the property -- in the southern corner of the project. Mostly impractical for 
development, the hilly land is part of an area recognized as ecologically 
sensitive by Los Angeles County. It would be reserved for hiking trails and a 
few estate lots, Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials have also vowed not to pave over any part of the 
100-mile-long Santa Clara River, critical habitat for the least Bell's vireo, 
an endangered songbird, and the last refuge of the unarmored three-spined 
stickleback, a tiny fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan filed with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Newhall Land would 
preserve the Santa Clara River's natural soft bottom and add materials to 
riverbank sections where erosion occurs. That is considered preferable to 
putting in concrete channels, which reduce the chance of flooding but speed up 
water flow, scouring the riverbed farther downstream, disrupting river wildlife 
and prohibiting water from seeping into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would appear they're taking the sensitive way to go," said Dave Vannatta, 
a field deputy to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But some environmentalists plan to argue that no structures should be allowed 
in the river's flood plain, so there will be less pressure in the future to 
alter its natural state to protect buildings. They are pushing the Army Corps 
of Engineers to require a full environmental report of the company's plans 
instead of accepting a less thorough environmental assessment that has already 
found no significant impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic impact of the project also troubles Santa Clarita officials, who 
founded the city six years ago out of concern that unbridled building was 
outpacing the growth of public services in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many more people can this valley hold?" asked Councilwoman Jan Heidt, 
pointing out that the Santa Clarita Valley was the fastest-growing region in 
the county before the recession hit. "The impact is going to be just 
tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land officials said they could not estimate the amount of traffic the 
project would generate on California 126, the Golden State Freeway and already 
congested local roads. But they minimized the effects, saying many Newhall 
Ranch residents would work in local business parks now being built in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land's environmental studies will not be completed for months, but it 
is certain that the impact of the new project will be felt in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 As the closest Ventura County city to the new community, Fillmore will 
probably feel its effect most heavily. And some city residents say they are 
looking forward to the groundbreaking because it may help Fillmore emerge as a 
tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County officials said the development would eventually create 
enormous pressure on the county to alter its strict policies limiting 
construction in unincorporated areas separated from existing cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials note that Newhall Land is involved in a 10-year process to remove 
all of its unincorporated Ventura County acreage from a state farmland 
conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to be very concerned about this project's impact on Ventura 
County," said Maggie Kildee, county supervisor for the Santa Clara Valley 
communities of Piru, Fillmore and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land executives say they simply want to remove government restrictions 
from their land and have no development plans for their Ventura County 
holdings, which stretch westward past Piru seven miles into the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their fears are unfounded," Harter said. "The world changes. I don't 
know what the world will be like 25 years from now. But at the present time, we 
have no plans for development in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Ranch alone would not be completed until the year 2032, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the real estate market is still soft, Newhall Land is just one of 
several developers around the state attempting to obtain approval for huge 
projects in anticipation of the end of the recession, said Bill Fulton, 
publisher of the California Planning and Development Report. For instance, in 
San Diego County, a developer plans to build a huge housing project on the 
23,000-acre Otay Ranch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's interesting to me is that Newhall Land waited so long to do 
this," Fulton said. "It's evidence of how incredibly slow and late L. A. is in 
coming out of this recession compared to Northern California and San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the depressed housing market, Harter said more than half of the 
housing in Newhall Ranch would be attached owner-occupied and rental housing, 
such as condominiums, townhouses and apartments. Homes on the Horizon 
</P>
<P>

 CONEJO CLINIC: The first public health clinic in the Conejo Valley has opened 
(B4). . . . Until recently, much of Ventura County's effort to provide public 
health care was focused in the west county. But the Thousand Oaks clinic has 
brought low-cost care closer to home for some. "This is much more handy," 
resident Patti Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 BOTTOMS UP: Michael Fay, what hath thou wrought? . . . Spurred by the harsh 
punishment meted out to the Ohio teen-ager, who was caned four times for 
graffiti crimes in Singapore, a California Assembly committee has approved a 
bill that would allow authorities to smack taggers up to 10 times with a wooden 
paddle (A3). . . . The measure still faces major legislative hurdles. And it 
hasn't won much local support. "I cringe personally when I think about it," 
said Frank Woodson, Ventura County's corrections chief. "Crime is a serious 
problem, but is that what we want as a society?" 
</P>
<P>
 IT'S A MYSTERY: Salinas has Steinbeck. Hannibal, Mo., has Mark Twain. Even 
Tarzana has Edgar Rice Burroughs. . . . In Ventura, the scribe of renown is 
mystery writer Erle Stanley Gardner, who brought fictional lawyer Perry Mason 
to life. . . . Local author Richard Senate is planning a Masonesque 
murder-mystery tour downtown. And fans have set up a temporary shrine honoring 
Gardner at Ventura's Phantom Bookstore, near the office where he once toiled. 
But they're baffled by the lackluster response. "That's the big mystery to me," 
one lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 LAWYER POOL: Gasp! Just in time to beat the heat, a group of Oxnard attorneys 
has for the second year in a row come to the rescue of La Colonia's public 
swimming pool (B1). . . . Closed in 1991 because of budget cuts, the pool 
reopened last summer after a bailout by Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig and a few 
of his lawyer friends. . . . This year, they'd hoped for financial help from 
the city. But Oxnard officials said their coffers are still dry.

NEWHALL RANCH PLAN PUTS COUNTY OFFICIALS ON EDGE; DEVELOPMENT: THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF A PLANNED COMMUNITY EAST OF PIRU RAISES CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY and TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for a new 70,000-resident community on Ventura County's northeast flank 
have prompted a flurry of concerns about river degradation, traffic snarls and 
the eventual sprawl of suburbia across the farmlands of the Santa Clara Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all of the Newhall Ranch project announced last week would be in Los 
Angeles County, it would fill five miles of open space between Six Flags Magic 
Mountain and the Ventura County line along California 126. 
</P>
<P>
 And, say local officials, environmentalists and real estate analysts, it would 
eventually create enormous pressure on Ventura County to alter its strict 
growth policies to allow Newhall Land & Farming Co. to build on 15,000 acres it 
owns in this county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to be very concerned about this project's impact on Ventura 
County," said Maggie Kildee, county supervisor for the Santa Clara Valley 
communities of Piru, Fillmore and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about traffic and air quality and the Santa Clara River. And 
part of my concern is what happens on this side of the line," Kildee said. 
"We've already had a lot of pressure to lay out a development plan on this 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn said he is so troubled by the new Newhall Ranch 
proposal that he will check with county lawyers to see if there is anything 
that Ventura County can do to block it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Santa Clara Valley should remain as it is," he said. "If Newhall develops 
here, it will wipe out that valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials note that Newhall will have removed all its Ventura County acreage 
from a state farmland preservation program by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall executives say that they simply want to lift government restrictions 
from their land, but that they have no development plans for their Ventura 
County holdings, which stretch westward past Piru seven miles into the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the company is focused on its new Los Angeles County project, which 
alone will take perhaps 25 years to build, Newhall Vice President Jim Harter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their fears are unfounded," Harter said. "The world changes. I don't 
know what the world will be like 25 years from now. But at the present time, we 
have no plans for development in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from long-term concerns, Ventura County officials say the new Newhall 
Ranch proposal -- just beginning to wend its way through a three-year approval 
process in Los Angeles County -- must answer questions about its potential 
effects on Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 25,000 homes, 10 schools, six shopping centers and a business 
park, the new development would be the largest master-planned community in Los 
Angeles County history. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be six times the size of Fillmore, which is just 14 miles away, three 
times the size of Port Hueneme and larger than Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say they expect to challenge the project on a variety of fronts, but 
acknowledge that its passage by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
seems inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Ventura County, Los Angeles County has no policies restricting 
construction in unincorporated areas that provide greenbelts between existing 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Also working in Newhall's favor is its reputation as developer of the 
attractive, well-planned Valencia community, and its assertions that it will 
make Newhall Ranch a model of environmentally sensitive development along an 
endangered river. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials have vowed not to pave any of Newhall's part of the 
100-mile-long Santa Clara River, the largest remaining wild river in Southern 
California and a habitat for the endangered least Bell's vireo songbird and the 
unarmored three-spined stickleback fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall also plans to remove no river vegetation and will artificially support 
river banks only in the several areas prone to erosion during floods, Harter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we plan basically leaves the river in its natural state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cat Brown of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Newhall has made a good 
start. But she said she wants fewer artificial supports of river banks, which 
destroy the habitat of frogs, turtles and birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Bottorff, chairman of Friends of the Santa Clara River, said his group 
will argue that no structures be allowed in the river's flood plain, so there 
will be less pressure after future floods to change the natural flow to protect 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottorff said his group is pushing for a full environmental report on Newhall 
Ranch's potential damage to the river. A less thorough environmental assessment 
has already found no significant impact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the development will undoubtedly go through in some form," Bottorff 
said. "The best we can do is reduce the impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall's environmental studies will not be completed for months, but it is 
certain that the impact of the new project will reach into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * California 126, although widened to four lanes by the time Newhall Ranch 
construction begins in 1998, will certainly feel the project's effect. Most of 
the thousands of new commuters, however, are expected to drive eastward to 
large industrial parks in Santa Clarita or to the Los Angeles Basin. A 
Metrolink right of way from the Golden State Freeway to the Ventura County line 
has been set aside for a future commuter train. 
</P>
<P>
 * More traffic will mean more air pollution. But Ventura County's top planner 
says air quality will probably not be a major issue locally, since prevailing 
winds usually blow inland, away from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fillmore residents will be closer to large stores and entertainment, their 
commute cut from 25 miles to about 16. But the new shopping centers might 
undermine some local stores. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local officials fear that the new community could increase the potential for 
urban pollution to drain into the Santa Clara River, although developers say 
they will use the latest technology to make sure that that does not occur. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new sewer plant could overflow during storms and pollute the ground-water 
basins that supply Fillmore residents and Santa Clara Valley ranchers. But 
Newhall executives say the new plant, run by Los Angeles County, would include 
excess capacity to prevent overflow. 
</P>
<P>
 * The new city will need thousands of acre-feet of water a year, but none of 
it will come from the Santa Clara River subterranean basins on which the 
Fillmore area depends, Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the closest local city to the new community, Fillmore would probably feel 
its touch most heavily. And some city residents say they are looking forward to 
the groundbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Roger Campbell said the shops along Fillmore's classic 
small-town main street should not be undermined. "Our town's economy is more 
based on the agriculture in the area and on the commitment of our people to 
shop locally than on what shopping malls go where," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopkeeper Michelle Patterson said she thinks that her customers will keep on 
coming. "We have a personal relationship with our customers, and I think that's 
true of any business in Fillmore." 
</P>
<P>
 And City Manager Roy Payne said Newhall Ranch may help Fillmore emerge as a 
tourist destination. "To my mind, this just brings tourists five miles closer 
to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore is basing its future allure partly on rides aboard full-sized steam 
and diesel locomotives expected to eventually offer regular dinner excursions, 
not just special charter events. 
</P>
<P>
 And Campbell thinks that development of Newhall's Metrolink right of way could 
someday combine with 32 miles of track on the Fillmore line to help link Santa 
Clarita with Ventura -- and make life easier for Ventura County commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are already pretty much a bedroom community," Campbell said. "That would 
make it so people wouldn't have to use their cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Campbell and several other Santa Clara Valley residents said they do 
not see the Newhall Ranch project, or a potential low-density, high-quality 
Newhall development in Ventura County, as a large threat to their rural 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a very fine company," said Alan Teague, president of Teague-McKevett 
Co. of Santa Paula, which owns about 500 acres of farmland in the Santa Clara 
Valley. "I have no fear of what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Teague said he thinks that some development of the valley is inevitable and 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two industries that built this valley are agriculture and oil," Teague 
said. "One of them is about gone and the other is being threatened. . . . We 
are going to have to replace that. We need some increased economic base." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is the local long-range intentions of Newhall, as a major Ventura County 
landowner, that concern some Ventura County officials and environmentalists 
more than its Los Angeles County proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "As they move westward, this becomes their area of opportunity and ultimately 
that will affect some of our orchard and flatlands farming," said Neil Moyer, 
president of Environmental Coalition of Ventura County. "Certainly that's their 
intention." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall officials have never submitted a plan for development to Ventura 
County, and they insist that they do not have one to submit. But over the last 
few years, they have asked county planners about the potential for development 
locally, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I spoke with them, I would characterize it as a fishing 
expedition," county planning Director Keith Turner said. "They wanted to know 
were there any opportunities for some sort of urban development in the long 
term. Our answer was 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some landowners seem to think that county policies that force the clustering 
of development in and around cities are simply a holding plan until a good 
project comes along, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is our position that county plans for open space, and the river and 
mountain areas and the agricultural and citrus belts, will remain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's strict Guidelines for Orderly Development have been in place for 
more than two decades. But supervisors sometimes break them, as they did in 
approving the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch project in 1992 and the Sherwood 
Country Club development in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, supervisors said large and costly trade-offs from developers -- 
community improvements and parkland -- made the violation of policy worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that Newhall wants to develop," Kildee said. "If Newhall wants to 
build and will put X number of acres in an agricultural trust for perpetuity, I 
might talk to them. But I want them to be talking about 85% (in a trust), not 
2%." 
</P>
<P>
 The way some in Ventura County see it, Newhall will try to develop its Ventura 
County acreage as the final phase of a 37,000-acre, two-county building plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase was 10,000-acre Valencia, where development began in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase is the proposed 12,000-acre Newhall Ranch. And once the 
roads, sewers, water and rail lines are in place up to the Ventura County line, 
they will try to make a move here. 
</P>
<P>
 "That seems to be their plan," said veteran Westlake real estate analyst 
Ernest V. Siracusa Jr. "But it will take them 20 years before this area is 
sufficiently built out so they'll try to move into the next area. They know 
darned well they couldn't get anything approved now. 
</P>
<P>
 "A county line is just a political boundary," he added. "But on one side of 
that line is a vast difference in philosophy on development issues. In Ventura 
County, they will have a mountain of political policy to climb."

COPS ON THE RUN; SCHOOL POLICE HAVE LONG BEEN NOMADS -- BUT THAT MAY BE 
CHANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles school police officers assigned to the San Fernando Valley, West 
Los Angeles and Harbor areas are nomads. 
</P>
<P>
 They use their cars, local schools with understanding staffs, parking lots and 
even restaurants to conduct the normal business of campus policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some change into their uniforms in their cars, others drive an hour to pick up 
a patrol car to begin their shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that could change. Under a new effort to decentralize the Los Angeles 
Unified School District's police department, three new offices are scheduled to 
open to alleviate the officers' inconveniences and to bring services closer to 
the schools. The police finally could have a place to write reports and 
interview suspects and witnesses. And, they won't have to drive Downtown to 
school district headquarters to complete paperwork or training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had officers dressing in their cars, holding briefings in the parking 
lot," said Sgt. Randolph Glymph, who is assigned to the Valley. "We really need 
a place out here to conduct business. It would be a much more efficient way of 
dealing with the schools and taking care of business." 
</P>
<P>
 The school police department's efforts are twofold: first, to restructure 
operations from the Downtown district headquarters and second, to give officers 
and other police employees a more visible and more effective place to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes no sense for a West L. A. officer or detective to drive Downtown and 
then turn around and go to West L. A.," said school district Police Chief Wes 
Mitchell. "The officers also need a sense of connectedness. There is a real 
sense of loneliness out there -- their bosses are 30 or 40 minutes away." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he will submit a plan for the new offices to Supt. Sid Thompson 
and that the police department should have space by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, he said the school police need a more visible presence 
throughout the school district. He said, for example, he would like to find 
space in the district's Van Nuys regional office.  
</P>
<P>
 The police officers are constantly driving Downtown to the school district to 
submit reports and attend meetings. The sergeants and detectives are Downtown 
at least once a week, and usually more often, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, the officers park their patrol cars at the district's Sun 
Valley garage where the transportation department keeps school buses and a 
bungalow. The officers recently were granted permission to use the office for 
their morning roll call, but bus drivers and other transportation employees are 
sharing the same space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only allowed to share it for those few minutes," Glymph said. "Bus 
drivers are walking through, supervisors. There's no locker room. It's just not 
ours." 
</P>
<P>
 The police department's clerical staff who work for the Valley and other areas 
of the city all work out of the district's offices at 450 N. Grand Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Side, the story is worse, police say. There, the district has no 
place to park school police cars and no office space at all. The officers, 
sergeants and detectives meet at schools and Downtown, and the Los Angeles 
Police Department sometimes loans the department some space. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Harbor area, the department has a small office where some police 
officers meet, but most say it is inconveniently located in the southern part 
of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The police say they need central locations to meet suspects and witnesses and 
that they typically do not want to interview the students in LAPD stations. 
"That's not always the environment we want to be in with these kids," Mitchell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district is embarking on a massive restructuring effort, shifting 
from top-down decision-making. The school system will be reorganized into 
clusters and complexes of schools with reduced layers of district 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The police department's efforts are in keeping with the overall district 
philosophy, officials said. "It's definitely consistent with what we're trying 
to do," said Assistant Supt. Dan Isaacs, who oversees the district's school 
operations division. "We're all trying to bring services closer to the school 
sites." 
</P>
<P>
 But while their efforts are similar, the problem is space. With more district 
departments branching out to schools, more district employees need office space 
closer to the campuses. Support services, for example, such as counselors and 
others, will need space as well, Isaacs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a lot of space, so this has to be handled carefully so we're 
not stepping on each other's toes," Isaacs said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District's police department has two bureaus 
that cover most of the city. The plan to open three new offices would draw 
officers and other employees from those bureaus. The Valley bureau has one 
assistant chief, one lieutenant, nine sergeants, five detectives, 116 officers 
-- of whom 76 are assigned to schools and 40 are on patrol -- five plant 
security aides and two clerical workers. The Southeast bureau has one assistant 
chief, one lieutenant, nine sergeants, five detectives, 117 officers -- 
including 74 assigned to schools and 44 on patrol -- 13 plant security aides 
and two clerical workers.

EX-DEPUTY SENTENCED FOR SEX WITH INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who admitted having sex with a 
woman prisoner at the Van Nuys courthouse was sentenced Tuesday to community 
service, but not to jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered Larry Wayne Fraize, 43, to perform 
200 hours of community service and serve three years felony probation and also 
pay a $900 fine. A 180-day jail sentence will be imposed if Fraize violates his 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraize was found guilty of two counts of oral copulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson, who prosecuted the case, said he was 
satisfied with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an appropriate punishment . . . even severe punishment," Yochelson said. 
"We were not able to demonstrate that (Fraize used) force or coercion." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Judy Champagne made her decision based on transcripts of the preliminary 
hearing after Fraize waived his right to a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraize, assigned to duty as a court bailiff, was arrested in May, 1993, after 
he was caught on a surveillance videotape receiving oral sex from a female 
inmate in a holding tank at the Van Nuys court complex. A 10-minute portion of 
the six-hour tape also showed the inmate engaging in sex with another woman in 
custody while Fraize looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told investigators that she was not forced to have sex with the 
deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the video camera was set up after an inmate told authorities 
that Fraize was sexually involved with prisoners under his guard. 
</P>
<P>
 He was prosecuted under a statute that forbids acts of oral copulation "while 
confined . . . in any local detention facility." 
</P>
<P>
 During the proceedings, Fraize's attorney, Paul Kinion, unsuccessfully argued 
that the former deputy could not be prosecuted under a statute written to curb 
sex between inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Kinion -- who plans an appeal -- said that while Fraize crossed a 
line by having sex with an inmate, his client committed no crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is egregious. He was in a position of trust and he violated it," Kinion 
said. "But what he did is not against the law . . . the conviction will not 
stand."  
</P>
<P>
 Fraize, a deputy for 11 years, resigned from the department, and the incident 
caused Fraize's wife to divorce him, Yochelson said. With the conviction on his 
record, he can no longer serve as a peace officer, and is required by state law 
to register with authorities, wherever he lives, as a sex offender.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; SENTENCING SET IN TAX EVASION SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 33-year-old Westlake Village inventor who pleaded guilty in Ventura County 
Municipal Court to charges of state income tax evasion is scheduled to be 
sentenced Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake R. Schwartzman, the co-inventor of the raised plastic ring that protects 
Swatch watches from scratching, failed to file state tax returns on more than 
$1 million from 1987 to 1989.He now faces back taxes, penalties and interest of 
more than $200,000 and could be sentenced to up to three years in prison, Jim 
Reber of the California Franchise Tax Board said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Schwartzman created a company in Williamson County, Tex., called Best 
Timing. He also registered to vote, opened several bank accounts and obtained a 
driver's license in Texas, which has no state income tax, Reber said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can only suspect that he wanted to save $200,000 in taxes," Reber said.  
</P>
<P>
 California authorities learned from a confidential informant earlier this year 
that Schwartzman never actually moved to Texas and had been living in 
California all along. After checking Schwartzman's financial and utility 
records and other documents, authorities charged him with tax evasion in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unusual case because of the lengths he went through to deceive 
us," Reber said. "We believed there was criminal intent." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

<TEXT>
<P>
 The principal of Reseda High School has been chosen by his peers to receive an 
annual leadership award, the Los Angeles Unified School District has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Kladifko was awarded the prestigious Thelma Barnes award by the 
local chapter of the Assn. of California School Administrators (ACSA) at an 
awards banquet earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Kladifko's leadership, Reseda High School will add an 
environmental/physical science magnet school and a humanitas academy beginning 
Friday, when the new school term begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Kladifko, who has been at Reseda High School since 1987, serves as president 
of the school district's Senior High Principals' Organization. He was named 
1992 California High School Principal of the Year by the ACSA, which represents 
about 14,200 administrators statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 On campus, Kladifko is known for his outgoing personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very popular, said Diana Munatones, the school district's director of 
communications. "His staff, teachers, students and the parents really like 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 The award honors the memory of Thelma Barnes, a former Los Angeles principal 
who was nationally recognized for her contributions to students, parents and 
the education community. 
</P>
<P>
 Past recipients of the award include district Supt. Sidney Thompson, Deputy 
Supt. Ruben Zacarias, former High School Division administrator Harriette 
Williams and former Supt. Harry Handler. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 'DODGER DAY' TICKETS TO AID DEPOT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To raise money for restoring the old Santa Susana Railroad Depot in Simi 
Valley, members of the nonprofit Rancho Simi Foundation will hold the city's 
fourth annual "Dodger Day" on July 9. Tickets must be purchased by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the evening game between the Dodgers and the New York Mets are $8, 
with all proceeds going directly into a fund to restore the 1903 building, said 
Bill Funk, organizer of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Funk said members of the foundation recently completed restrooms for the 
facility and hope to next restore the station's freight room and community 
room. He said residents have donated many weekends to the restoration effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a labor of love," Funk said. "We're trying to bring the station back as 
close as we can to its original condition." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation recently received one prized donation: the original sign from 
the depot, which had been making the rounds of local swap meets before someone 
recognized it and turned it over to the foundation, Funk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Susana Railroad Depot was sold to the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park 
District in 1974 for $1 and moved to Santa Susana Pass Road from its original 
location on Los Angeles Avenue and Tapo Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The park district is using a $250,000 grant to restore the station's exterior. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Funk said the tickets were made available by an anonymous donor within the 
Dodger organization. For more information, contact Funk at 527-9339, Walt 
Griffin at (818) 889-2613 or Supervisor Vicky Howard's office, 582-8010. MARY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; FALCONS SHOW AT-RISK YOUTHS SKY'S THE LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The group that assembled for a lesson under an ash tree at William Tell 
Aggeler High School in Chatsworth was not made up of what you would call model 
students.  
</P>
<P>
 Some had committed crimes. Others had been expelled from other schools. But at 
least for one hour Tuesday, the students listened raptly to a wide-ranging 
lecture that covered topics as diverse as zoology, history and sports. 
</P>
<P>
 It helped, of course, that instructors used Cranky, a Gyr-Barbary hybrid 
falcon, and three other feathery friends in their talk on and demonstration of 
the ancient sport of falconry.  
</P>
<P>
 Science teacher Paul Schuster invited staff members of the Lancaster-based 
Falconry Academy to come and make a presentation for students to enhance their 
understanding of the animal sciences.  
</P>
<P>
 Taurus, a brown and white Harris hawk, flew from his perch on academy 
instructor Kristen Rossell's glove to a nearby tree as a crowd of crows, 
disturbed by the presence of the predatory falcons, cawed overhead. A few 
minutes later, attracted by some food that Rossell tossed in the air, Taurus 
swooped down and maneuvered a perfect landing on Rossell's forearm.  
</P>
<P>
 Students leaned forward to get a better look as Rossell's husband, academy 
director Stuart Rossell, put Cranky through his paces. The falcon's wings 
appeared to be barely moving as he glided toward a lure swung on a string by 
Rossell. The falconer then offered his glove for Cranky to mount, tucked the 
lure away in his pocket and rewarded the bird with a piece of chicken meat.  
</P>
<P>
 Because Cranky was considered a "flight risk" in the small schoolyard, the 
bird of prey was leashed throughout the exercise. Falcons such as Cranky can 
easily fly away to a wider, more open area because they can achieve speeds of 
up to 120 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to expose (students) to the fact that there is a lot out there in 
life to investigate and a lot of positive things to get involved with," 
Schuster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggeler is an "opportunity" high school for at-risk youth from grades seven 
through 12. Most of the students come from the nearby Rancho San Antonio Boys 
Home, a Catholic facility for juvenile offenders and youths from troubled 
homes. Others came to the school after being expelled from regular high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Students agreed that the demonstration appeared to stimulate more upbeat 
thinking patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives me an idea of something I can do when I get older, something like my 
career," said Travon Anderson, a 10th-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these kids have shot at birds," said fellow sophomore David Buerger. 
"Now that they are actually able to see birds up close, I think it's going to 
change these kids' views. Instead of shooting at them, maybe they'll throw them 
food." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; WATER AND SANITATION RATES TO RISE UP TO 9% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third time in three years, the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District 
raised water and sanitation rates by up to 9%, effective in November. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of next year's budget approved unanimously by the board of directors 
Monday night, the district raised rates for the average customer by about $3 to 
nearly $39 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase was kept below a 15% rate hike proposed to offset increased water 
prices and reduced fees from new development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased with the way we were able to stretch the budget to avoid an 
increase of that size," said board member Glen Peterson. "We scaled back 
several things heavily, but we will be able to meet all of our goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said the rate hike is partly a result of a similar price increase 
imposed by the massive Metropolitan Water District, which supplies water to Las 
Virgenes. 
</P>
<P>
 And with a steep drop in development between Topanga Canyon and the Ventura 
County line, the smaller agency is scrambling to find ways to pay its debt on 
ambitious projects undertaken during better times, such as a $50-million 
facility that will turn sewer sludge into compost. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the rate hikes of 7% for drinking water and 9% for reclaimed water are 
put in place in November, the board will hold at least two public hearings on 
how to structure the new rate schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rates for the 14,000 households that use Las Virgenes water are still 
lower than those in most other Southern California districts, residents of the 
arid, semirural Conejo Valley area use nearly twice as much water as the 
statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to minimize the rate increase, the board placed a hiring freeze 
on the district and cut major projects such as the installation of a pipeline 
along Agoura Road and construction of a new district headquarters. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE; COURT IS FINALLY ASSIGNED IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After being assigned to three different courtrooms in the past two weeks, a 
high-profile Westlake shooting case has finally found a home -- at least for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 William Huang, John Yi and Oubansack (Andy) Sonethanouphet have each been 
ordered tried as adults on criminal charges stemming from a Feb. 4 melee at 
North Ranch Park in Thousand Oaks that left two Westlake High School football 
players wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 But their preliminary hearing was stalled June 16 when defense complaints led 
to the case being bounced to three different courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney John E. Meyers first complained when the case was assigned to 
Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark, an elected judge on Ventura 
County's Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers, who represents Huang, said he did not want Clark or another acting 
Superior Court judge, Herbert Curtis III, hearing his client's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But court officials transferred the case from Clark to Curtis anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers then accused Curtis of bias, sending the case to the courtroom of 
Charles W. Campbell, the supervising felony judge. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Campbell put Clark back on the case, ruling that Meyers' original 
motion to disqualify Clark had not been filed in a timely manner. Now, the 
preliminary hearing is set for July 12 before Clark. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; CHURCHES HIT BY QUAKE GET HELP REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tucked away from the bustling North Hollywood traffic in between automotive 
service shops and industrial storage facilities, a warehouse devoted to 
supplying churches affected by the Northridge earthquake with building 
materials and children's clothing opened at 9 sharp Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A project of World Vision US, an international Christian relief and 
development agency, the warehouse was already stocked with more than $20,000 
worth of fiber board, $4,000 in paint and $120,000 in children's clothing and 
supplies -- all new. 
</P>
<P>
 Countless earthquake victims who were turned down for government grants and 
loans have sought help from churches, World Vision officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But churches, too, were hard hit by the quake and themselves could not qualify 
for federal Small Business Administration loans. 
</P>
<P>
 To help them out, World Vision has set up shop in North Hollywood to supply 
materials to rebuild damaged chapels and to replenish supplies to be given out 
to the area's needy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the quake was over, the churches became the points of light to people," 
said the Rev. Obadiah Smith, World Vision's program manager of domestic 
disaster response.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith said damage to churches in the quake was at least $200,000 and could be 
as high as $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he said, World Vision has given more than $500,000 to churches for 
families in need of assistance, and about $300,000 to churches to repair their 
own buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be here until February of next year," Smith said. "It's not just an 
in-and-out operation."  
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jose D. Carlo, pastor of St. Simon Episcopalian Church in San 
Fernando, took back with him between $60,000 and $80,000 worth of children's 
clothing to give to San Fernando residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Carlo said he was impressed that all items at the warehouse were donated 
directly from corporations.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that it's all new stuff really cheers people up because they know 
they're not getting someone's leftovers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista del Valle in Pacoima, a church-run facility that assists men who 
shave recently been released from prison, was destroyed by the quake, said the 
Rev. Ben Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up 60 sheets of fiber board to be used to repair the kitchen. MAKI

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; $5 MILLION APPROVED FOR 2 THEATER GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale Redevelopment Agency voted Tuesday to set aside $5 million of its 
$24-million 1994-95 fiscal year budget for two theater companies to pay for 
proposed renovation and construction activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, whose members are the same as those who sit on the City Council, 
agreed to set aside $2.5 million each for A Noise Within and The Colony Studio 
Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 Agency funds set aside to assist area theaters increased from $3 million to $5 
million as part of a push by city officials to create a citywide theater 
district, said JeanneArmstrong, redevelopment agency director. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the two theater groups must devise business plans and map 
out how they will raise matching funds before they can receive agency money, 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once plans are established and authorized by the city, agency members will be 
able to vote on how agency money set aside for both theater groups is 
distributed to them, said City Manager David Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of The Colony Studio Theatre originally requested funds from 
the city in November, 1992, so that the company could build a 299-seat 
playhouse in Glendale, along with a 99-seat second stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-member company is now reviewing several relocation options, including a 
spot in The Exchange building on Brand Boulevard and property adjacent to The 
Exchange, said Earl Katz, Colony Studio's development director. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based group hopes to open its 1996 season in a theater in 
Glendale. The company chose Glendale as its new location after a poll of season 
ticket holders showed they preferred Glendale to six other Los Angeles County 
locations, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old company is now over-subscribed and is unable to accommodate 
all those who wish to attend its four stage performances a year in a 99-seat 
theater at 1944 Riverside Drive near Silverlake, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 A Noise Within will use $100,000 of its portion of agency funds for a study 
that will determine if the classical theater group should move from the Masonic 
Temple at 234 S. Brand Blvd. in Glendale to a new theater complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Julia Rodriguez Elliott said her company would prefer to 
stay in the Masonic Temple and to move from the building's third floor to its 
first floor, which would be revamped to hold a 350- to 500-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Pending the outcome of the study, Rodriguez Elliott said, the 2 1/2-year-old 
theater group hopes to use a majority of its $2.5 million in set-aside funds to 
refurbish the Masonic Temple or to build a new theater.  
</P>
<P>
 This expansion is necessary because the theater company has been running at 
95% capacity at the 99-seat stage it now uses, Rodriguez Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Noise Within has also requested that about $400,000 in agency funds be used 
to install a fire sprinkler system in the Masonic Temple and to offset rent 
costs.  
</P>
<P>
 City staff members said the two playhouses would join the newly renovated Alex 
Theatre along the Brand Boulevard corridor in a theater district designed to 
attract patrons to the downtown central business district. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CITY READIES PLAN FOR QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of San Fernando has put together a tentative plan on how to spend an 
additional $900,000 in earthquake relief aid intended for businesses, 
homeowners and residents who have not received the federal help they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the money is earmarked for low-interest loans and grants, said Robert 
Kishita, associate city planner. However, details -- such as interest rates -- 
have not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the spending plan is scheduled for the next City Council meeting 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city got word early this month that it was eligible for the additional 
aid, but city officials had to scramble to meet a deadline last week to put 
together a tentative program to qualify for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is supplemental Community Development Block Grant funds available 
through the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Those funds can be used only for earthquake relief not available from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency or Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 About $250,000 of the additional money may be used to help the city put up its 
2.5% match for the federal earthquake relief aid it has already received, 
Kishita said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to help us," Kishita said, adding that it means being able to 
use funds that would have been used to match other grants. "It frees up our own 
internal resources." 
</P>
<P>
 But, more importantly, he said, the city will be funneling money into three 
new projects -- commercial rehabilitation, residential aid and new housing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the commercial rehabilitation program, city officials envision giving 25 
grants of about $3,000 to $4,000 to San Fernando businesses, as well as 
offering loans of about $20,000 to help those businesses that did not get 
enough earthquake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses were in no position to qualify for a Small Business 
Administration loan before the earthquake and could not get the earthquake 
relief, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's primarily a bricks-and-mortar type of program," said Kishita, explaining 
that the money is expected to be used to make repairs for earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents, the city is considering helping 35 to 40 properties, whose 
owners would receive either a $5,000 grant or a loan of up to $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to assist people where the resources ran dry," Kishita said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city also is considering four or five loans of about $20,000 each to help 
new construction projects to replace housing lost to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kishita pointed out that this extra funding will not meet all the needs in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some buildings have been damaged much more than the entire $900,000 package 
can meet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program can be altered by the City Council after next week's meeting and 
public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials do not have a schedule yet as to when they can expect to 
receive the funds, Kishita said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; WOMAN SOUGHT IN ROBBERY AT MOTEL 
</P>

<P>
 Police are searching for a 32-year-old Marina del Rey woman who lured an 
unwitting man to her Burbank motel room, where two male acquaintances waited to 
rob him. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a 22-year-old Hollywood man, was left naked and handcuffed on the 
floor after being robbed of $8,720 in belongings, including a $3,000 guitar, 
$2,430 in clothing, $2,000 worth of jewelry, a $500 gun and a $400 computerized 
organizer, Burbank police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar loss is great, but the type of occurrence where a young woman 
invites a guy to her motel room and male companions are waiting to rip him off 
is not that unusual," Police Sgt. Scott Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man told police he met Sally Ann Wiliamsen at a bar last week, exchanged 
phone numbers with her and finally got an invitation to spend the night with 
her at the Buena Vista Motel, 2255 Buena Vista St. 
</P>
<P>
 When he reached the motel room about 3 a.m. Monday, the man was surprised by 
two men with semi-automatic pistols -- one waiting in the bathroom and the 
other sitting in a chair -- police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen, apparently knowing their victim was armed, asked whether he was 
carrying any weapons, police said. He replied by turning over his own gun: a 
small caliber handgun kept in a shoulder holster. 
</P>
<P>
 He was ordered to take off his clothes and lie on the floor as the gunmen 
searched his backpack, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they left, he telephoned for help. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

 Several charitable organizations in Glendale have received grants totaling 
more than $8,000 from the Glendale Community Foundation's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale College Foundation received $541 for a paper shredder needed to 
destroy old health records of past students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health records are confidential and must be destroyed seven years from the 
student's last visit," said Ann Ransford, the foundation's executive director. 
"Each year this amounts to over 2,000 records that must be shredded. This grant 
will increase the efficiency of destroying those records." 
</P>
<P>
 In a matching grant, $1,500 was awarded to the R.D. White Elementary School 
for a classroom computer for students in the first through sixth grades. The 
foundation held a walk-a-thon to raise funds toward the purchase of the 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 A grant of $2,500 went to the Crescenta Valley Sheriff's Support Group toward 
the purchase of a mobile command post vehicle to handle community needs during 
major disasters and emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This grant will help us toward our goal of purchasing this vehicle to support 
a variety of field operations, including structure fires, wildfires, major 
floods, toxic spills and search and rescue efforts," said Richard Harris, the 
support group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Other grants totaling $3,081 were given to the Glenoaks School, Chandler 
School and La Canada Flintridge Educational Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Community Foundation has an endowment of $3 million that makes 
contributions to public charitable organizations every two months in Glendale, 
La Crescenta, Montrose and La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "By making grants every two months, we are able to deal with needs and issues 
as they arise," said Randall Melby, president of the 37-year-old foundation.

JUDGE WILL CONSIDER ACCEPTING PARTIAL VERDICTS IN SAMUELS TRIAL; COURTS: JURY 
ENDS 15 DAYS WITHOUT DECISION ON FATE OF WOMAN CHARGED WITH PLANNING MURDERS OF 
HUSBAND AND HIT MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the jury ending 15 days of deliberations without result Tuesday, a Van 
Nuys Superior Court judge said he would consider accepting partial verdicts in 
the trial of Mary Ellen Samuels for allegedly orchestrating the murders of her 
estranged husband and a hit man. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury of six men and six women have given no report of their progress. 
Since late last week, everyone involved in the case has been wondering what is 
going on behind the closed jury room doors. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been signs of discord among the jurors. On Monday, the jury 
replaced its foreman, a retired engineer, with a store manager who originally 
had been one of the six alternates. In the corridors of the Van Nuys 
courthouse, lawyers are wondering if the Samuels jury could be just the latest 
in a series of hung juries. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff said in court that 
he will consider taking partial verdicts today if the jury has reached any. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, 45, is accused of hiring hit man James Bernstein -- one of her 
daughter's two fiances -- to kill her estranged husband, a camera operator's 
assistant who worked on the films "Heaven Can Wait" and "Lethal Weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, 40, who'd known Mary Ellen since childhood, was shot to death 
on Dec. 8, 1988, in his home on Bahama Street in Northridge, apparently as he 
headed toward his tanning bed.  
</P>
<P>
 Eight months later, suspected hit man Bernstein, a 27-year-old drug dealer, 
was strangled and dumped in remote Lockwood Canyon in Ventura County. His two 
admitted killers, Paul Gaul and Darrell Ray Edwards, testified for the 
prosecution under plea bargains, pointing their fingers at Mary Ellen Samuels 
as the woman who hired them to commit the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels also testified, denying everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Since deliberations began June 9, the jury's questions have centered around 
the attempted murder, solicitation and conspiracy charges. Not a single 
question has been asked about the two murder counts, or the special 
circumstance allegations that could send Samuels to the death chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors must decide who is lying and who is telling the truth among the 
trial's steady stream of barflies, would-be hit men and other characters. 
Weighing their credibility is further complicated by the fact that some 
prosecution witnesses are alleged accomplices who testified under grants of 
immunity. The second pair of hit men were spared the death penalty in exchange 
for their testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 And the legal requirements to prove a charge of solicitation of murder aren't 
easy for non-lawyers to digest, attorneys said. For solicitation to be proved, 
the jurors must be convinced Samuels really intended for her husband -- and the 
hit man -- to die. There has to be corroborating testimony from at least two 
credible witnesses, or testimony from a single witness that is backed up by 
other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, deliberations hummed along. There wasn't a peep from the jury 
room. Week 1 went by, then Week 2. By Week 3, signs of strain could be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, one juror asked the court clerk what the other jurors should do 
if they were "having a problem" with the foreman. The clerk advised the juror 
to write a note to the judge. He didn't, but by Monday night a new foreman was 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiosity got the best of Judge Hoff on Friday, when he summoned lawyers to 
his courtroom, telling them, "I was contemplating asking the jury where they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Saying he'd hate to see jury members snagged on the lesser counts if they have 
already decided the murder charges, Hoff asked prosecutor Jan Maurizi and 
defense attorney Phil Nameth if they would be interested in a status report 
from the jury, or in accepting partial verdicts, if any have been reached. The 
verdicts could be read in court, and the jury sent back to deliberate further. 
Or, the verdicts could be sealed until the jury reached verdicts on the 
remaining counts or a mistrial was declared. 
</P>
<P>
 But both lawyers said they were afraid to ask anything of the jurors because 
the questions might imply they should have reached a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi had no comment Tuesday. But, in the past she has theorized that the 
story line of the case is so implausible, so stranger-than-fiction, that jurors 
might be having difficulty deciding whether to believe any of it.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither would Nameth comment on the deliberations, even though conventional 
courthouse wisdom dictates that the longer a jury deliberates, the better the 
news will be for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who has done this for a living would have to tell you they have no 
idea what the jury is doing," Nameth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions the jurors posed Tuesday indicate they are pondering the conspiracy 
charges, which may mean they are reaching the end of their deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier questions had focused on the solicitation charges, and an attempted 
murder charge based on an incident in which Samuels struck her husband over the 
head with a pink object. Witnesses differed over whether that object was a lead 
pipe, a broomstick or a rubber dog toy. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors also asked to have the testimony of two key prosecution witnesses 
-- David Navarro and Heidi Dougall -- read back to them. That testimony 
centered around Samuels' search for a hit man to kill her estranged husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a fair, conscientious, dutiful jury giving this case the time 
and deliberation it needs because of the seriousness and complexity of this 
case," Nameth said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deliberations have taken a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 As jurors filed out of the courtroom Friday and headed toward the elevators, 
one woman sighed, looked out the seventh-floor window and said "I want to 
jump." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't jump," said another juror. "I'll throw you." 
</P>
<P>
 He was smiling. Sort of.

PANEL AGREES TO $2 MILLION FOR PARKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a blow to Southern California conservationists, the Senate Appropriations 
Committee on Tuesday recommended only $2 million for the purchase of parkland 
for the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area next year -- the lowest figure 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Representatives had approved $5 million, only one-third the 
amount that advocates had requested. President Clinton also included $5 million 
in his proposed budget for the 1995 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping for $5 million, at least," said Melissa Kuckro, legislative 
director for Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), the recreation 
area's preeminent House advocate. "This is a sign of how squeezed they are with 
discretionary spending" under Clinton's deficit-reduction program. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuckro said Beilenson will urge a conference committee of Senate and House 
members to approve $5 million when it meets to reconcile the two chambers' 
spending bills. In the past, however, the conference has often split the 
difference between the two spending figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate panel's action marked the latest step in an apparent decline in 
support for funding for the Santa Monicas. After several years when it received 
more acquisition money than any other unit of the national park system, the 
Southern California recreation area ranked fourth on the committee's list, 
Senate aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Gate National Recreation Area topped the recommended recipients with 
$5.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, the Santa Monicas received $4 million last year, which 
was far less than it had been granted for any fiscal year since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the National Park Service is seeking funds to acquire 19 
properties, totaling 500 acres along the Backbone Trail, which are estimated to 
cost $10 million. The 43-mile trail winds along the spine of the Santa Monica 
Mountains from Will Rogers State Park to Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson maintained that Southern California's prolonged economic downturn 
has created temporary buying opportunities for normally expensive properties in 
the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that, given the vulnerability of the mountainous land to 
wildfires and mudslides, purchasing property for open space could save large 
sums in future disaster aid.

COUNCIL OKS PROPOSED 24-CHILD DAY-CARE CENTER IN NORTHRIDGE; CITY HALL: THE 
ACTION GIVES THE PROVIDER THE GREEN LIGHT TO DOUBLE THE SIZE OF HER CURRENT 
OPERATION. SHE HAD SOUGHT TO TRIPLE HER ENROLLMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved a proposal Tuesday to create 
a day-care center and preschool in a Northridge neighborhood, paving the way 
for the 24-child facility to open by September. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's vote signaled at least a partial victory for Sherri Segre in her 
bid to enlarge her current day-care center in the 18000 block of Devonshire 
Street. It also put into motion a larger plan by two councilwomen to rethink 
the way child-care centers are reviewed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Centers that serve 12 or fewer children now can open with just a state 
license, but larger facilities proposed in residential areas of Los Angeles 
require city public hearings, which often prompt neighborhood disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's vote, Councilwoman Laura Chick said in an interview that she 
plans to ask the council next week to urge city planners and child-care 
advisers to create a set of guidelines. These would be used by the council to 
determine, possibly without public hearings, whether a child-care center is a 
good use for a single-family residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick and Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg maintain that residential areas may be 
the ideal places for such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Segre, who now cares for 12 children, had sought to triple her enrollment but 
faced opposition by some of her neighbors who argued that the larger business 
would be inappropriate at its present site. The proposal approved Tuesday by 
the council will allow her to double her number of charges, to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy it was approved," Segre said. "Maybe somewhere along down the road 
it could be increased." 
</P>
<P>
 Under city zoning laws, a child-care facility with more than a dozen children 
in a residential area requires at least one public hearing and the approval of 
a city zoning administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Segre's proposal was approved by a zoning administrator last year, but 
neighbors appealed the decision, eventually sending it to a council committee. 
There, the neighbors' appeal was upheld and Segre's plan rejected, with the 
issue sent to the full council for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick had proposed the smaller, 24-child center, but her colleagues failed to 
give their support during a first vote last week. Then the council turned 
around and approved it unanimously Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A reluctant Councilman Hal Bernson was among those who voted Tuesday in favor 
of opening the center. Bernson had previously argued that the project would set 
a bad precedent and had asked his colleagues to reject it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after the vote, Bernson acknowledged that he had learned just before 
the vote that if neither his nor Chick's proposals had garnered at least 10 
votes, then the city would have to let stand the city zoning administrator's 
previous approval of the 36-child facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still agree with the community on this, that because of the location it 
sets a bad precedent," Bernson said. "Regardless of how altruistic and 
wonderful child care is, it is still a business." 
</P>
<P>
 James Geoffrey Beirne, an attorney representing Segre, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't represent commercialization down Devonshire," Beirne said. "It's 
about kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Beirne said Segre and her husband, Fernando, plan to work closely with Bernson 
and homeowners to make sure they are "good neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Chick and Goldberg, both of whom supported the project, had 
previously said the case demonstrates how difficult the city's process makes it 
for child-care providers to meet the growing demand for day care. 
</P>
<P>
 Segre, who charges about $100 a week for each child, said her services are 
indeed in demand. She has a waiting list of 20 names, she said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HEAT, DRY BRUSH SPARK FIREWORKS FEARS; 
PALMDALE: CONDITIONS AND RECENT BLAZES HAVE FIREFIGHTERS MORE ANXIOUS THAN 
USUAL AS STANDS OPEN CITYWIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sweltering temperatures and tinder-dry brush caused firefighters to be more 
alarmed than usual Tuesday by an annual Palmdale tradition: the opening of the 
city's fireworks stands. 
</P>
<P>
 They pointed to the Angeles National Forest, just south of the city, where 
fierce brush fires have blackened thousands of acres, sending up smoke clouds 
that were clearly visible in Palmdale last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 And they pointed to local temperatures, repeatedly topping 100 degrees, and 
the dim prospects for cooler conditions before the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes only a spark from any kind of fireworks to get something going," 
said county fire inspector Wade Little. 
</P>
<P>
 The fireworks sales also made the U. S. Forest Service nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resources are depleted," said Randi Jorgensen, a spokeswoman for the 
service, which oversees the Angeles National Forest. "Grass and bushes are 
really dry. The potential for wildfires is very great right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale is among 37 cities in Los Angeles County that allow the sale and use 
of state-approved "safe and sane" fireworks, but it's is the only city that 
allows fireworks in the north part of the county. They are prohibited in the 
San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, in neighboring Lancaster and nearby 
unincorporated areas such as Acton. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders in other communities, especially those where dry brush is prevalent, 
are worried that residents will buy the devices in Palmdale and set them off in 
prohibited areas, raising the risk of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Even county firefighters who are based in Palmdale say that fireworks sales, 
particularly this year, make their job tougher. "We're concerned that fire 
activity is going to be higher, and with the heat, it's going to be tougher on 
the crew," said Capt. Bill Glancy of Fire Station 24 in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Because of the heat and fire weather, there are some extra crews on 
duty." 
</P>
<P>
 The wisdom of selling Fourth of July fireworks has been debated on numerous 
occasions by Palmdale leaders. City officials have had to weigh the fire risks 
against the value of fireworks as a fund-raising tool for local nonprofit 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, city leaders put the issue on the ballot and local voters, by a 
2-to-1 margin, decided that fireworks sales should continue. During that 
campaign, fireworks supporters argued that the stands raise more than $200,000 
annually for Palmdale-based nonprofit organizations, including service clubs, 
the YMCA and school groups. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the city approved a record 36 stands, operated by 29 local groups. 
</P>
<P>
 At a stand run by Palmdale's American Indian Little League, customer Debbie 
Shout said she didn't mind shelling out $40 for fireworks because it helped the 
youth group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancaster resident said she plans to take the fireworks to a family 
gathering in Kern County. "I have nine nieces and nephews, and I buy them 
mostly for them," Shout explained. "We're very safe. We put a garden hose 
nearby, and only the adults can set them off." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Jiron, 18, also of Lancaster, bought $92 worth of fireworks at the 
stand. He plans to ignite them at a holiday party in Nevada. "The 'Piccolo 
Pete' is my favorite," he said. "It whistles really loud." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers who staffed these stands, which are made of sheet metal, were 
well aware of the extreme heat on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-afternoon, the temperature in Palmdale was 108. Pamm Volpone said she 
thought it felt twice that hot inside the Palmdale High School Band Boosters 
stand at Sierra Highway and Avenue S. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have sweated off 10 pounds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volpone said she was concerned that the heat increased the local fire hazards. 
But she added: "I hope the early fires won't hurt our sales. We need to do as 
well as we can."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA ADOPTS $69-MILLION BUDGET FOR 
1994-95; FINANCES: THE PLAN IS $19 MILLION LARGER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE. NO 
MAJOR PROGRAMS ARE CUT. 
</P>

<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday night adopted a $69-million budget for 1994-95, 
$19 million more than the previous budget, dominated by construction projects 
and with few new programs or services. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget was approved by a 4-1 vote, with Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy 
dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget does not mandate layoffs, and no major programs were cut. But city 
employees get no cost-of-living pay increases and three full-time jobs were 
left unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two assistant planner jobs were left open for the entire fiscal year, and an 
associate planner job will be vacant for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The budget reflects the third year of relatively flat revenue trends clashing 
with increasing costs to maintain the same level of services," said City 
Manager George Caravalho in his annual budget message. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita expects to bring in $54.4 million in the upcoming fiscal year, 
with sales and property tax revenues totaling only about $531,000 more than the 
prior year because of a poor real estate market and a sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Council action Tuesday included passage of a $24 annual fee on property owners 
that will generate $2 million per year to cover some of the costs of monitoring 
and cleaning storm drains for pollutants, as required by the federal Clean 
Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee was adopted reluctantly, with council members expressing frustration 
at having to adhere to the federal pollution program or face legal action. 
"This is just another example of the federal government stepping in with 
another unfunded mandate," said Mayor George Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a simple matter, and it's one the council has wrestled with for 
months," said Councilman Carl Boyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 budget provides for more than $24 million in construction work. 
Topping that list is $11.3 million to widen sections of San Fernando Road, $3.2 
million to repave city streets and $2.3 million for bicycling and walking 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city departments submitted budget requests with no increases from the 
prior year, but some new expenses were included: 
</P>
<P>
 * About $898,000 for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which 
provides Santa Clarita with police protection under contract. It includes a 5% 
cost-of-living increase for sheriff's deputies, a storefront station in Newhall 
and additional deputies -- one at the new La Mesa Junior High School and one 
for an anti-gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * About $835,000 to cover the cost of an expected legal fight against a 
proposed 190-million ton dump in Elsmere Canyon. The canyon is outside Santa 
Clarita's city limits, but elected officials fear it would harm the underground 
water supply, air quality and property values. 
</P>
<P>
 * About $620,000 for previously expanded bus routes, including a new route to 
Century City, for the entire fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 * A $500,000 reserve for expenses caused by the Northridge earthquake that the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency may not reimburse to Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussion of Santa Clarita's 30-year redevelopment plan, that was to be 
adopted along with the budget document, was delayed until a study session 
tonight.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ACCIDENTAL FIRE GUTS FAMILY OPERATED STORE; 
EMERGENCY: ELECTRICAL FIXTURES ARE BLAMED. AN INVESTIGATION CONTINUES. DAMAGES 
ARE ESTIMATED AT $500,000.

<P>
 A family run liquor and convenience store in one of the city's oldest 
neighborhoods was gutted by an accidental fire Tuesday morning, possibly caused 
by electrical circuits in the back of the store. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire occurred about 6:30 a.m. at Placerita Liquor Store at 24358 San 
Fernando Road, said Deputy Renee Dibb of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's 
Station. No one was in the closed store at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage was estimated at $100,000 to the 50-year-old building and $400,000 to 
merchandise, with the large amount of liquor inside accounting for much of the 
total, Dibb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say all of the contents are damaged due to smoke and other factors," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Asker said he arrived to open the store, owned for the past 13 years by 
his uncle, Ned, while firefighters were trying to control the flames. He said 
there was little to do afterward but sort through the wreckage and wait for his 
uncle to return from a vacation in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worse than getting fired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen firefighters forced their way into the front and back of the 
store to get to the fire and cut a hole in the roof to provide ventilation, 
Dibb said. Buildings surrounding the store were not threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 One firefighter suffering from heat exhaustion was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Valencia where he was treated and released, said Inspector 
Mark Savage of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire is officially considered an accident, although its cause remains 
under investigation, authorities said. However, officials and family members 
said electrical fixtures at the rear of the store were the most likely cause of 
the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The store was one of two convenience outlets available to residents of the 
east Newhall neighborhood, which has no grocery stores nearby, said Hector 
Gorellio, a resident there for the past 30 years. He described the business as 
an old-fashioned family operation that was a favorite hangout among those 
living nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asker family has eight brothers and a sister who own 32 independent 
convenience stores in Southern California. Sam Asker said he is certain his 
brother Ned will rebuild and reopen the damaged Newhall store. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community loves my brother, and I'm sure as soon as he opens his doors 
they'll be right back," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SUSPECT IN PIPE BOMBING RECONSIDERS HIS PLEA 
DEAL; LAW: THE MONROVIA MAN FACED A FOUR-YEAR TERM AFTER PLEADING NO CONTEST TO 
TWO CHARGES. HIS SENTENCING IS DELAYED. 
</P>

<P>
 Three weeks after agreeing to a plea bargain that would have landed him in 
state prison for four years, Charles Edwin Smith, accused of exploding a pipe 
bomb under his ex-wife's unoccupied pickup truck, is reconsidering the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a decision that could cost him 20 years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to think about withdrawing his plea, a lot of people do," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Smalstig. "It's called buyer's remorse, basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 70, was to be sentenced Tuesday, but that was delayed until July 22 at 
his request. In the meantime, Smith, who lives in Monrovia, remains in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 To withdraw the plea, Smalstig said, Smith would have to show legal cause, 
such as lacking adequate mental capacity at the time he entered into the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 7, Smith pleaded no contest to felony use of a destructive device with 
intent to cause injury or destruction and also one count of stalking in 
violation of a restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the plea, which called for Smith to be sentenced to four years 
in state prison, three other felony charges against him were to be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 If Smith is convicted of all five of the counts -- including explosion of a 
pipe bomb beneath his ex-wife's motor home, making terrorist threats and 
possessing the materials to make a destructive device -- he could face 20 years 
in prison, according to his attorney, Michael C. Eberhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of evidence against him," said Eberhardt earlier this month 
when Smith accepted the plea bargain. "At his age he didn't want to risk (a 
sentence of) 15 to 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Eberhardt did not return repeated telephone calls Tuesday to explain why his 
client may want to try to get out of the plea. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he sticks with the plea bargain, Smith could face additional prison 
time if he is charged and convicted of arson in a 1993 fire that broke out in a 
Chatsworth condominium owned by his ex-wife, Rini Duzanne. The investigation in 
that case is continuing.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEW SUPERINTENDENT NAMED FOR SAUGUS SCHOOL 
DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saugus Union School District trustees Tuesday chose a man with a decade of 
prior Santa Clarita Valley school experience to serve as their new 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Fazio was approved to take over the $95,000-a-year post that will be 
vacated in September by Supt.Troy Bramlett. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio, now superintendent for the tiny Cardiff Elementary School District near 
San Diego, worked in the Santa Clarita Valley from 1966 to 1976. He was 
principal of Rosedell School and later Highlands School, both in the Saugus 
district, and then superintendent of the Castaic Union School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio was chosen from about 30 applicants, seven of whom were interviewed by 
trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sensed a high energy level -- a desire for excellence -- in him," said 
board President Deme Larson, noting Fazio's prior work in the district as an 
asset. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio is scheduled to begin in mid-August on what will probably be a four-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Bramlett announced his retirement in late February, citing health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has had diabetes for four years and that his doctor recommended 
more exercise and less tension to help battle the symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saugus district has a $23-million budget and includes 10 elementary 
schools with about 6,500 students. A $10.2-million bond measure passed in 1993 
will be used to finance the building of two additional schools.

VALLEY BRIEFING: BURBANK PORTRAIT; A SMALL TOWN MOVES INTO PRIME TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank in the 1920s was a small city surrounded by vast farmland, and it 
seemed to have only one asset: plenty of space. The undeveloped land attracted 
companies that could put it to use, like Lockheed and First National Pictures, 
later known as Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Burbank is a prime media location and hosts three major studios: Warner 
Bros., the Walt Disney Co. and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the city bore the brunt of Johnny Carson's late-night jokes. Yet 
entertainment has always been a financial friend to Burbank. In 1992, the 
industry spent more than $1.5 billion on goods and services in Burbank, 
according to the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents take pride in a city that is close to Los Angeles yet insulated from 
big-city worries. In recent years, however, Burbank has begun to grapple with 
such issues as violent crime and growing ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Burbank enjoys the coziness of a small Midwestern town, where top 
officials are listed in the phone book and one can drive through the city's 
17.1 square miles in under 30 minutes. A BRIEF HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
 * In the beginning: Originally Spanish territory, much of Burbank was part of 
a huge cattle-raising domain known as Rancho San Rafael. The rancho was awarded 
to Commandante Josee Mariia Verdugo by the government of Spain in 1798, in 
thanks for his military service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ranches and farms: Dentist and farmer David Burbank bought the western 
portion of the rancho in 1867, as well as what is now the southern portion of 
Burbank, and turned it into a successful sheep ranch. Later, the surrounding 
countryside was divided into farms producing peaches, grapes, alfalfa, melons 
and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aircraft and film: Incorporated in 1911, Burbank thrived during World War 
II. Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Co. produced a steady stream of war films, 
and Lockheed churned out one of every 11 American planes flown in the war. 
COMMUNITY ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank's schools are deteriorating physically. Burbank High School, for 
example, is about 70 years old and needs to be completely rebuilt, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 A $100-million bond issue proposed to fund renovation and repair of school 
facilities failed on the April ballot. It garnered 53% of the vote, well short 
of the two-thirds majority needed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents blamed the school board for leaving unclear how the money would 
be spent and how much homeowners would have to shell out. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members have turned to the community in search of answers, and this 
summer the panel will select a new school superintendent to replace the 
resigning Arthur Pierce. THE ECONOMY 
</P>
<P>
 The California recession struck Burbank hard. Lockheed's facilities closed 
four years ago and 10,000 to 15,000 aerospace jobs were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city rebounded with the help of a growing entertainment industry and, 
more recently, the temporary relocation of businesses damaged in the Northridge 
earthquake. The vacancy rates in Burbank office buildings is currently 16.2%, 
according to Matt Hargrove, a broker for Cushman & Wakefield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're lucky in that we're not a one-industry town," said James O'Neil, 
special assistant to Burbank's community development director. Officials are 
counting on a revitalized downtown to draw consumers. Community Profile

BILL FOR PADDLING VANDALS CLEARS ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prodded by growing public dismay over graffiti, a key Assembly committee 
approved a landmark bill Tuesday allowing juvenile court judges to punish 
youthful vandals by ordering they be whacked up to 10 times with a wooden 
paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 If enacted, the measure would reinstitute court-ordered corporal punishment in 
the United States for the first time in more than four decades, legal scholars 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Public Safety Committee voted 4 to 1 for the bill by Assemblyman 
Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), who was inspired by the recent caning in Singapore of 
an American teen-ager for spray-painting cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's measure appeared to face long odds in the Public Safety Committee, 
which historically has been a graveyard for hard-nosed GOP anti-crime efforts. 
But two Democrats joined with a pair of Republicans to push the legislation 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 It still must survive another committee hearing and an Assembly floor vote, 
where Speaker Willie Brown has vowed to defeat the bill, before it can move to 
the Senate. Gov. Pete Wilson has indicated he supports the bill but has not 
said he would sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Safety Committee added a sunset clause requiring the Legislature to 
renew its approval after paddling is given a three-year trial run. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee endorsed the measure despite vocal opposition from the American 
Civil Liberties Union and other foes, who questioned the measure's 
constitutionality and effectiveness while calling Conroy's effort election-year 
posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beating of offenders as a form of punishment runs contrary to the 
fundamental notions of decency in our justice system," said Francisco Lobaco, 
ACLU legislative director. "It's really not the way to solve the issue. 
State-sponsored violence is not an answer or a solution. I think it's a 
horrible idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Dreyfuss, legislative advocate for California Attorneys for Criminal 
Justice, described the bill as "court-sanctioned child abuse." MaryAnn Memmer 
of the California PTA said Conroy's proposed punishment would prove profoundly 
ineffective: "Hard-core gang criminals will not be deterred by a swat from a 
paddle." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, however, portrayed his legislation as a firm way to steer errant 
youths away from destructive, gang-related activities such as violence and 
drugs. He also cited the high cost of graffiti cleanup and paraded half a dozen 
experts before the committee to provide vivid testimony about the violent 
intentions gang members sometimes express through graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "By spraying their gang markings and taggings all over their communities, 
these hoodlums commit the worst of all crimes possible -- they create an 
environment of fear and despair for the innocent, law-abiding citizens living 
in these afflicted neighborhoods and communities," Conroy said. "As many 
residents who live in such areas will tell you, once the graffiti moves into 
their communities, the crime and violence is quick to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 He said residents of California cities are "fed up with the coddling of 
juvenile graffiti vandals" and suggested his bill would provide "quick, 
effective and decisive punishment" to taggers who thumb their noses at existing 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy contends traditional forms of punishment, such as putting juvenile 
offenders in California Youth Authority facilities, are seen by hardened 
teen-agers as a "badge of honor" and do little to curb problems with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's bill would allow a judge to order a parent to deliver four to 10 
strokes with a wooden paddle in the courtroom. If the parent declined or the 
judge found the force of the spanking unsatisfactory, a bailiff would do the 
paddling. The paddle would be three-quarter-inch-thick hardwood, 18 inches long 
and six inches wide with a six-inch handle. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bill requires that the names of juvenile offenders who get 
the paddle be made public, a tactic designed to heighten the humiliation and 
deter other would-be vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy began pursuing the idea after being prodded by constituents and staff 
members caught up in the highly publicized debate over the Singapore case. 
Michael Fay, an 18-year-old high school senior from Dayton, Ohio, got four 
strokes of a rattan cane May 5 after being found guilty of vandalism in the 
island nation in the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics worry that Conroy's proposal and similar ideas circulating in 
Florida, Maryland and Texas could begin to tug the country back toward a style 
of court-ordered punishment abandoned decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Many critics cite research showing that corporal punishment can lead to 
embitterment, anger and post-traumatic stress while teaching impressionable 
youths the contradictory lesson that violence is the way to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The constitutionality of Conroy's bill remains in the eye of the beholder. The 
California legislative counsel, which provides legal opinions to state 
lawmakers, said that Conroy's bill is unconstitutional, but the staff counsel 
for the Public Safety Committee said the issue remains "an open question" and 
that there is "no bright line" setting the limit for what is unconstitutionally 
cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy also has been particularly optimistic because U.S. Supreme Court 
Justice Antonin Scalia -- the intellectual leader of the court's conservative 
wing -- predicted in a recent talk that caning, a far more brutal form of 
punishment than paddling, could pass the high court's muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Although paddling is outlawed in California schools, the practice remains 
legal in public schools in 23 states. Many legal scholars say the 
constitutionality of school paddlings is an issue distinct from corporal 
punishment for juvenile offenders, but Conroy argues that youngsters would be 
guaranteed more solid protections in a court of law than in a schoolroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Conroy pushed his proposal, opponents were confident that the bill 
would be defeated in committee -- until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it had no chance," said Dreyfuss of the California Attorneys for 
Criminal Justice. "Now people are going to have to wake up. There's a lot of 
opponents out there who thought this bill was so stupid they wouldn't have to 
make it an issue. I think they now understand that this is possibly going to 
get out. Now we really have to come to our senses and fight the bill."

O.C.'S COASTAL CITIES GIRD FOR JULY 4 THRONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Police officers throughout coastal Orange County will take to the streets on 
foot and bicycles, in squad cars and all-terrain vehicles and even in 
helicopters this weekend, determined to prevent the kinds of melees that have 
marred Fourth of July weekends in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 With hundreds of thousands of people expected at beaches and festivities along 
the coast, police patrols -- augmented by reserve officers, undercover agents, 
detectives and others -- will strictly enforce curfews, seeking to control 
parties before they escalate into confrontations like one that was broken up by 
riot police in Huntington Beach last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to discourage what happened last year," said Huntington Beach Police 
Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg, whose entire 230-member force will be on duty 
throughout the weekend. "We're prepared as we can be. We're going to be damned 
busy this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Police in Huntington Beach battled revelers last year after hundreds of people 
built a bonfire fueled by furniture, cardboard boxes and garbage cans. Two 
years ago, Newport Beach experienced near-riot conditions that resulted in the 
arrests of more than 200 people in two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until last year, the Fourth of July was near-riotous conditions," said 
Bill Schonlau, former president of the West Newport Beach Assn. "It was like 
Times Square on New Year's Eve -- wall to wall drunks, totally out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police are gaining . . . an upper hand in this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach will close its beaches two hours early on Independence Day. 
In Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Seal Beach and San Clemente, beach curfews will 
be strictly enforced. If there are problems, police warn, early curfews may be 
imposed on Friday, Saturday or Sunday as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach officials are expecting an estimated 325,000 people to visit 
the three beaches within city limits on July 4 alone. An additional 250,000 
spectators are expected at the city's annual parade. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 175 arrests were made and 300 bicycles were impounded during the 
holiday weekend in Huntington Beach last year. Lowenberg said many revelers 
used stolen bikes to get around the crowded area, then left them behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers will have riot gear readily available this year, Lowenberg said, 
adding, "I hope we don't have to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Police also will be given the option of using tear gas to break up crowds that 
get out of control. But Lowenberg said tear gas will be a last resort, because 
shifting winds at the beach could spread the gas into nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Tactical teams -- consisting of a lieutenant, two sergeants and 20 police 
officers -- will be ready to act quickly in any problem area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to try and keep it as safe as we can so everybody can enjoy 
themselves," Lowenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta Wolfe, co-chair of the Downtown Residents Assn., which was formed 
after last year's problems, said she is satisfied with the Police Department's 
preparations this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy that the message has gone out for people to be responsible if 
they come to Huntington Beach," Wolfe said. "But if they think they can come 
here and get out of control, light fires and irresponsibly shoot illegal 
fireworks and threaten the security of our homes, they have another think 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach police also have implemented a series of measures to curb 
violence and out-of-control celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 140 sworn police officers and 21 reserve officers, joined by 12 
Orange County sheriff's deputies and 38 California Highway Patrol officers, 
will be deployed in 12-hour shifts on Monday, Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniformed officers will be assigned to foot beats, special four-officer 
tactical teams will respond to loud party complaints, plainclothes officers 
will be deployed in an effort to identify trouble spots early, and a large 
contingent of officers will be assigned to traffic enforcement, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 10 p.m. beach curfew will be strictly enforced throughout the 
weekend and a city ordinance prohibiting loud noise will be in effect. Noise 
ordinance violators may be fined as much as $150. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will block off one end of Seashore Drive and Balboa Boulevard to 
restrict the overflow of pedestrians and bicyclists. All city-owned parking 
lots on Seashore Drive and Superior Avenue and in front of City Hall will be 
closed at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming traffic will be barred from noon July 4 to 1 a.m. July 5 in a section 
bordered by West Coast Highway, West Balboa Boulevard, Prospect Street, 32nd 
Street, and the beach. The area includes Seashore Drive, the eastbound lanes of 
West Balboa Boulevard and the 100 block of all streets between Prospect and 
32nd streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The westbound lanes of West Balboa Boulevard will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will conduct sobriety checks at an undisclosed location in the city 
during the holiday weekend. The checkpoint will be clearly marked, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect problems," Gonis said. "We expect crowds but not problems. We 
hope for less congestion than we had before, because of the steps we took last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, where there is no beach curfew for adults, police have 
"maximized . . . deployments," Sgt. Ray Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Fourth of July weekend was marred by what appeared to be a 
gang-related shooting at Heisler Park near Main Beach. Over the three-day 
holiday period last year, police arrested 41 people, mostly on suspicion of 
drunk driving and possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, officers will patrol the beach in an all-terrain vehicle "to make 
sure we don't have any gang gatherings" said Deputy Chief Jim Spreine. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seal Beach, Sgt. Dean Zanone said the department will increase its foot and 
bike patrols during the weekend. Two officers will be added to patrol the 
beach, Main Street and the pier, which is scheduled to reopen this weekend 
after repairs of damage caused by an earlier fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra officers will also be deployed Monday night, when crowds are expected to 
converge at Seal Beach to watch the fireworks at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente, which expects about 75,000 people to attend its annual fireworks 
show in the city's Pier Bowl area, experienced apparently gang-related drive-by 
gunfire last Fourth of July. Although no one was hurt, police say they are 
taking no chances this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this town, everyone will be on duty," said Sheriff's Department Lt. Tom 
Davis, chief of San Clemente police services. "We want to maintain a family 
atmosphere at all of our beaches."

GM RELOCATION BONUS FAILS TO ENTICE LAID-OFF WORKERS; LABOR: SOME EX-VAN NUYS 
PLANT EMPLOYEES PREFER A PAYCHECK FOR NOT WORKING TO $25,000 AND A JOB 
ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What does it take to get someone to leave Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
 For several hundred laid-off employees of General Motors' closed Van Nuys 
assembly plant, even offers of new GM jobs in other states -- along with 
$25,000 signing bonuses -- aren't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, there's a catch: The laid-off auto workers are receiving full pay 
plus health insurance and other benefits from GM for doing nothing but biding 
their time. 
</P>
<P>
 And under the current union contract, they can continue receiving most or all 
of that jobless compensation until September, 1996 -- more than four years 
after the last Camaros and Firebirds rolled out of the San Fernando Valley 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that may feel like winning the lottery to some workers, the 
arrangement has become an increasing annoyance to GM. So the auto maker is 
trying to exercise its option to wiggle out of the situation -- and relieve its 
staffing shortages elsewhere -- by coaxing ex-Van Nuys employees to get back to 
work and onto the company's production lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has whipped up conflicting emotions inside and outside the circle of 
former Van Nuys workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The enhanced relocation packages recently offered to those still on layoff 
have infuriated ex-Van Nuys workers who previously accepted far stingier moving 
allowances. The new packages -- including the $25,000 bonuses just for agreeing 
to take new jobs, along with moving expenses and other cash incentives paid 
over two years -- are worth up to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Back when the plant was shut in 1992, the maximum relocation package was 
$3,324. Frank Macomber, a Van Nuys veteran who took a GM job in Indiana after 
the San Fernando Valley plant closed, resents what he regards as the company 
rewarding people who have shirked work for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been all over the country, trying to stay with GM," said the 
42-year-old Macomber, referring to transfers to plants in Oklahoma and 
Louisiana when he encountered previous layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the people getting $60,000 relocation packages today, "we got a 
raw deal," Macomber said. "We were all Van Nuys employees. We all should have 
had the same option." 
</P>
<P>
 But GM officials believe that the $60,000 packages are what they need to spend 
to get the remaining laid-off workers to relocate and resume working. It 
broached the offer to the ex-Van Nuys workers two months ago and recently 
started making the package available to workers from four Midwestern plants. 
</P>
<P>
 GM wants to transfer these veteran employees to plants where more staff is 
needed because of the company's surging sales and the large number of workers 
who left to accept early retirements and buyouts in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've thought it out carefully, and talked to the union about ways of getting 
people back" to work, said Charles Licari, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Longridge, a spokeswoman for a GM components division that has hired 
some Van Nuys workers, added: "We obviously would much rather be paying these 
people to be working than not working." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 1,900 of the 2,600 workers who lost their jobs when the Van Nuys 
plant closed in 1992 had retired, taken buyouts or transferred to other GM 
facilities by this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two months, an unspecified number of the remaining 700 Van Nuys 
workers also have decided to retire or relocate. In fact, two of the six GM 
plants scattered across the country getting new workers through the $60,000 
relocation program already have all the recruits they want. For some workers, 
the relocation money is offsetting losses that they will suffer in selling 
their homes in the depressed Southern California real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 Other workers have stayed here in hopes that they can land one of the 200 jobs 
being created at a seat-cover sewing plant in Brea -- a facility that GM opened 
this spring specifically to put more of the former Van Nuys plant people to 
work. About half of the workers already have been chosen and are in training. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that leaves several hundred people who are holding out, content to 
collect GM unemployment checks of $740 a week or more, until the final days of 
the union contract in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these Van Nuys veterans are committed to staying in Southern 
California because their spouses have good jobs here or because they don't want 
to leave their families and friends. Others are in school, preparing for new 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet others simply "are milking it to the end," said Ray Knudson, a retiree 
from the GM plant and a trustee of Local 645 of the United Auto Workers, which 
represents the former Van Nuys workers. Knudson said some are earning money 
from other jobs while collecting their GM checks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Knudson and other former Van Nuys workers say they are justified in 
"milking" the company. They say that GM reneged on a promise to bring in a new 
car line to keep the plant open after union members agreed to new work rules 
sought by the company. "GM done us wrong," Knudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 GM spokesman Licari declined to say whether the company ever made such a 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the workers still angry about the plant closing is John Dominguez of 
Palmdale, who was an electrician at Van Nuys. He says GM has offered him at 
least 20 jobs at plants in other states over the past two years, but he has 
turned them all down. Instead, he is taking courses at Antelope Valley 
Community College, with the eventual aim of transferring to a four-year college 
and then perhaps going into teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he feel as though he is soaking GM by taking its money even after 
rejecting the company's offers? Not a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this and say, 'GM ought to pay for all of the people it is 
screwing,' " said Dominguez, 42, who worked at GM for nearly 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Dominguez said, his union -- the United Auto Workers -- has given up 
wage increases over the years in exchange for winning more generous benefits 
for laid-off workers. Now that strategy is paying off for him. "It was a good 
move by the UAW," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The big moment of decision for Dominguez will come in 1996, when the GM 
payments run out. Dominguez concedes that he might be tempted to return to the 
company then, if he still has a job offer, particularly if he isn't close to 
getting his four-year college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 With a GM job, "the money is there, no question about that," he said. "But 
after 22 years at GM, it's not necessarily the money anymore. I put a lot of 
myself in that plant. I'd like to try something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Van Nuys veteran, Terri Varela, is trying to avoid being relocated by 
GM from Southern California for both medical and sentimental reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born and raised in California," she said. "I'm 57 years old. Why would 
I want to start somewhere else? I'll work (at an out-of-town GM plant) to 
survive, but as soon as I can, I'll come home." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, though, Varela is fighting for a medical retirement from GM. She 
has undergone surgery for back and wrist injuries that, she believes, came from 
her job. For 18 years, she polished car hoods, roofs and other sections. 
</P>
<P>
 She bitterly recalls the treatment that she received from company doctors when 
she reported her back and wrist pains. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept telling me there was nothing wrong with me, that with a little heat 
treatment, I'd be all right," Varela said. "When you go to a doctor in the 
plant, or one of the doctors they send you to, they are all for GM." 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm sitting and waiting," Varela said, as she waits to see how her 
injuries heal and how GM responds to her request for a medical retirement. 
"It's mind-boggling trying to figure out what you're going to do with your 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few weeks, GM has put added pressure on some workers to come back 
by sending them additional out-of-town job offers. The catch is that if the 
workers reject the offers, the company could in a year reduce their 
unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even that is a fairly mild action: The workers' pay would fall to about 
70% of what they used to earn, versus the 100% they receive now. The workers 
also would lose their dental benefits, but still keep other health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the ex-Van Nuys workers' arrangement with GM bewilders outsiders. 
Knudson cited the time when some of the laid-off workers refinanced their home 
mortgages and he got a call at the union office from a mortgage loan processor 
who needed to check on their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Knudson said the mortgage specialist was dumbfounded when he explained the 
situation to her. As he recalls it, the caller replied, "What do you mean they 
get paid to stay home? When do I get a job like that?"

CHINA ASSISTED U.S. EFFORTS ON N. KOREA, OFFICIALS SAY; ASIA: BEIJING 
REPORTEDLY RECOMMENDED FREEZING OF NUCLEAR PROGRAM -- AFTER CLINTON RENEWED ITS 
TRADE STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 China played an important, behind-the-scenes role in persuading North Korea to 
freeze its nuclear program and has since informed the United States of its 
efforts, Clinton Administration officials and Washington-based diplomats say. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before former President Jimmy Carter visited Pyongyang, China's 
Foreign Ministry in Beijing called in North Korea's ambassador to warn that his 
government could not depend indefinitely on Chinese support in its 
confrontation with the United States over its nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 The message China delivered was that it would be in Pyongyang's self-interest, 
for economic development and for its desire to reunify Korea, to cooperate more 
with international efforts to inspect its nuclear facilities, U.S. officials 
said. This warning is said to have been reinforced by a similar Chinese message 
to North Korea's ambassador at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had Chinese officials tell me they did that, and we've had other signals 
too that the Chinese were growing more and more frustrated with the North 
Koreans," a senior U.S. official said in an account confirmed by others in the 
Clinton Administration. "These recent moves by China . . . were quite 
significant in terms of affecting North Korea's thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing's efforts to influence North Korea were timed in a way that seemed to 
be aimed at rewarding the Administration for changes in its China policy. They 
came within weeks of President Clinton's announcement, on May 29, that he would 
extend China's trading privileges in the United States without imposing any 
conditions for improvements in human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither China nor the United States has claimed there was any connection 
between Administration help for Beijing on most-favored-nation trade benefits, 
on the one hand, and Chinese support for America with North Korea, on the 
other. But there have been suggestions of an informal, unstated link between 
the two issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had really, painstakingly worked with the Chinese," another Administration 
official said this week. "And after the MFN decision, the trend was ever 
clearer that the Chinese were getting fed up (with North Korea)." 
</P>
<P>
 By informing the Administration of its message to North Korea, China 
apparently was seeking to demonstrate to the White House the benefits of 
avoiding further friction between Washington and Beijing. Over the last few 
weeks, Chinese officials have been trying to convince the Administration not to 
go too far in upgrading the level of U.S. contact with Taiwan, which China 
considers a renegade province. 
</P>
<P>
 Before China delivered its message to North Korean diplomats, the Pyongyang 
regime had been threatening to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency and to expel its inspectors. "That recent dust-up over the inspectors 
was the proverbial last straw for China," one Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of China's message to Pyongyang is unknown. But within a short 
time, North Korean President Kim Il Sung, during Carter's trip, offered to 
freeze the nuclear program and to let international inspectors remain in North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Those developments have paved the way for a summit between North and South 
Korea, announced Tuesday and set for July 25-27 in Pyonyang. The meeting 
between the Korean presidents would be the first since the peninsula was 
divided at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 China's willingness to weigh in with North Korea represents a significant 
change. Over the last year, Chinese officials have told the United States that 
they have little or no influence over North Korea. They also have contended 
that the United States and its allies are exaggerating the threat posed by the 
North Korean nuclear program and that there was no hard evidence that North 
Korea had developed nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, when the Administration tried to win approval for a U.N. resolution 
condemning North Korea, China opposed the effort and succeeded in having the 
proposed resolution watered down to a "statement" that carried less weight. 
</P>
<P>
 China continues to oppose sanctions against Pyongyang. But over the last few 
weeks, Western diplomats say, China has become more cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 In changing their approach, Chinese officials are believed to have concluded 
that it is not in China's interest for North Korea to use its nuclear program 
to intimidate other Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 China also does not want a war on its borders; the North Korean crisis was 
beginning to take on military overtones. The Administration had started moves 
to bolster U.S. forces in South Korea, and North Korea had warned that the 
imposition of U.N. sanctions, which the United States sought, would be 
considered an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said the first signs of a possible change in policy 
by China came in June, when a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong, Ta Kung Pao, 
suggested that the Chinese government might restrict shipments of oil or even 
food to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, a delegation of North Korean military officials visited 
Beijing for talks with leaders of China's People's Liberation Army and Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin. In public, Chinese officials reaffirmed their old, close 
relationship with North Korea. Using language dating to the Korean War era, 
they said ties between Beijing and Pyongyang were as close as "lips and teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. experts on Korea believe that -- although Chinese officials embraced 
the North Korean military delegation in public -- privately they may have 
registered unhappiness with Pyongyang's nuclear policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after Carter returned with a promise from Kim to freeze his nuclear 
program, the Administration obtained detailed assurances of that pledge from 
Pyongyang. Clinton then announced that the United States would enter into a new 
round of talks with North Korea in Geneva beginning July 8.

AUTOMATIC CUTS STUDIED AS BUDGET IMPASSE CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With international bankers in town to discuss lending the state government the 
money it will need to pay its bills, legislators tried on Tuesday to draft an 
extraordinary standby plan that would trigger automatic budget cuts and tax 
increases if the state's fiscal condition worsens. 
</P>
<P>
 But legislators and Gov. Pete Wilson remained deadlocked Tuesday over 
seemingly irreconcilable differences and faced the prospect of another round of 
IOUs if they fail to act by the start of the fiscal year Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and his Republican allies in the Legislature insist that the new state 
budget and the debt management plan that accompanies it must be free of tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders want to include taxes in the equation. On their list of 
options is an extension of a temporary income tax surcharge on the wealthy and 
a narrowly targeted tax increase for closely held corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of a breakthrough Tuesday, and the Assembly and the Senate 
scheduled votes for today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not terribly optimistic," Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said Tuesday 
after Assembly Democrats met with the Republican governor's top fiscal adviser, 
Finance Director Russell Gould. 
</P>
<P>
 Controller Gray Davis said he was discouraged by the lack of progress in the 
Legislature and that he would begin issuing IOUs -- officially known as 
registered warrants -- between July 5 and July 12 if the state is still without 
a budget by then. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over the budget bill is taking a back seat this week to the struggle 
over a companion measure that is needed to persuade investors that the state is 
a decent credit risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The state government is already deep in debt and needs to borrow at least $4 
billion more by late July to pay its bills. But investors will be hesitant 
until the state provides greater assurances than it has to date that the debt 
will be repaid on schedule in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has borrowed previously to finance its general fund operations. Even 
when it ran a budget deficit, the state was able to repay private banks by 
borrowing from independent internal funds, the way a family might tap into a 
retirement account or a child's college fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But now even those funds have run out of money, and the state, under Wilson's 
two-year budget plan, would be hard-pressed to pay back the banks without a big 
federal bailout the year after next. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has demanded $2.8 billion in new funds from Washington to reimburse the 
state for the cost of serving illegal immigrants. But Wall Street is skeptical 
about the prospects for such a huge, new infusion of federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 To reassure the investors who will buy the state's bonds, the government plans 
to acquire credit insurance from a syndicate of banks led by Bank of America. 
The banks -- for a price -- will pledge to repay the debt if the state cannot 
deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 But the banks need their own assurance that the state will repay them if they 
are required to step in. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Taddey, managing director of BankAmerica Securities, said the banks 
need to be convinced that the state's obligations are both legally and 
financially sound. But he said it is not the job of the banks to tell the state 
how best to produce a healthy bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't try to usurp what we believe is the province of public sector 
decision makers," Taddey said after bankers from Europe, Japan and North 
America met with Davis and two Democratic legislators. "We really think that 
public sector decision makers -- politicians, state constitutional officers and 
the like -- their reasoned judgments have to come into play here." 
</P>
<P>
 To satisfy the banks, legislators are studying several versions of legislation 
that would trigger an automatic fiscal fix if the state's bottom line 
deteriorates between the passage of the budget and the middle of 1996, when the 
debts are due. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and most Republican legislators support a version that would close any 
gap entirely with budget reductions. That version has yet to be put to a vote 
in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate late Monday rejected another measure put forward by Senate 
Democratic Leader Bill Lockyer. Under that version, a cash shortage would 
trigger a combination of across-the-board reductions in all programs not 
protected by the state's Constitution and an extension of the state's temporary 
top income tax rate on the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution protects kindergarten through community college funding and 
payments on general obligation bonds approved by voters. Everything else -- 
including higher education, prisons, and health and welfare programs -- would 
be subject to the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 To soften the blow, Lockyer wanted to extend the temporary top income tax 
rates of 10% and 11%, which are currently in effect and otherwise would drop to 
9.3% at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a tax increase," Lockyer said. "It is an extension of an existing 
tax.' 
</P>
<P>
 But the Senate leader faced united Republican opposition and was unable even 
to muster unanimous support from the Democrats under his leadership. The bill 
failed on a vote of 19 to 18, short of a majority and well short of the 27 
votes needed for the required two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Democrats are working on a similar bill. But their version deletes 
the income tax provision and replaces it with a proposal to deny a 
small-business tax break to certain corporations. The break exempts small 
businesses from the bank and corporation tax. Democrats want to narrow the 
exemption so that large businesses with few owners no longer qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's clearly a loophole," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans support repealing the renters tax credit but say that any other 
tax -- new, extended or otherwise -- would be unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The various levels of government already are taking 40 cents out of every 
dollar you earn," said Phil Perry, a spokesman for Assembly Republican Leader 
Jim Brulte. "The Democrats want to take even more."

SIMPSON HEARING FOCUS IS ON EVIDENCE TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Skirmishing on the eve of a highly charged preliminary hearing, defense 
attorneys and prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson murder case squared off Tuesday 
over scientific tests being performed to determine whether the superstar 
athlete was at the scene of the bloody double homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson did not speak during Tuesday's emergency hearing, the fourth court 
session since his arrest after an internationally televised pursuit June 17. 
Unshaven and seemingly detached, he glanced around the courtroom as his lawyer 
and representatives of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office agreed 
on parameters for sharing certain evidence and conducting tests on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, agreed Tuesday to provide prosecutors 
with a sample of his client's hair for comparison with hair discovered in a 
blue knit cap found at the scene of the murders. Prosecutors have said in court 
papers that the hairs are "of African American origin" but have not linked them 
to Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 While the hair samples are the latest disclosure of evidence in the case, much 
of the argument in Thursday's preliminary hearing will focus on another body of 
forensic evidence -- bloodstains. According to police sources, investigators 
have taken blood samples from the scene of the murders, from Simpson's 
driveway, from inside his Ford Bronco and from a pair of dark brown work 
gloves, one found at the scene, the other outside his Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police crime lab specialists already have run tests on some of those samples, 
and forensic evidence pointing to Simpson as the likely culprit is expected to 
be introduced by prosecutors at the preliminary hearing -- at the end of which 
a judge will decide whether there is enough evidence to force Simpson to stand 
trial for the slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as prosecutors prepared for Thursday's hearing, police continued to hunt 
for more clues. Armed with a new search warrant, a team of officers descended 
on Simpson's house late Tuesday, in part, sources said, to search for the 
missing murder weapon -- a large knife that investigators in Los Angeles and 
Chicago have been unable to find. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were accompanied by police dogs and were carrying metal detectors 
to aid in their search. Legal experts generally agree that while the 
prosecution's case is unlikely to hinge on recovering the murder weapon, 
finding it would fill a hole in the case against Simpson that his attorneys can 
otherwise be expected to exploit. 
</P>
<P>
 With physical evidence apparently underlying much of the prosecution's case, 
Shapiro on Tuesday asked Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell to direct 
prosecutors to split up blood samples so that Simpson's experts can conduct 
their own tests -- presumably to counter any results offered by prosecution 
witnesses. Shapiro said he was not satisfied by a prosecution offer to allow 
Simpson's experts to observe while prosecution analysts performed the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are entitled to conduct our own independent tests, not simply to sit and 
look over the shoulder of the district attorney and the LAPD crime lab," 
Shapiro said. "It does us no good simply to watch what somebody else does." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge agreed in part, and ordered prosecutors to share whatever samples 
they could. Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, the lead prosecutor in the case, 
said government lawyers had no objection as long as the samples were large 
enough to split without jeopardizing the testing process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing that we have to hide from the defense," said Clark, a theme 
she repeatedly emphasized during Tuesday's brief hearing. "This case is an open 
book." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to blood samples, police discovered strands of hair in the blue 
knit cap found near the bodies. Once prosecutors obtain the samples of 
Simpson's hair, they will be subjected to DNA analysis, like the bloodstains. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the DNA results will be part of the preliminary hearing. Instead, 
prosecutors expect to present results of a less rigorous blood testing process 
known as serology -- one that scientific experts say can narrow the odds 
against two matching samples coming from different people to about 1 in 100. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA testing is far more exact, and prosecutors expect to complete those tests 
in time for Simpson's trial, should there be one. But the standards are lower 
at a preliminary hearing, in which a judge must only decide whether there is 
enough evidence for a defendant to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 If even the less exacting tests point to Simpson as a likely suspect, legal 
experts said, they might satisfy the requirements of the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take much to bind someone over," said Harland W. Braun, a 
prominent Los Angeles defense attorney. "The preliminary hearing is so that a 
judge can quickly look at the evidence and make sure that there hasn't been a 
mistake, not so that they can decide whether he's guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 The hair testing procedures are similar and could depend on the quality of 
samples taken from the scene, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Microscopic examination of hair has extremely limited value in a criminal 
investigation, according to Dr. Paul R. Billings, a forensic expert at 
California Pacific Medical Center. DNA fingerprinting of hair samples can be 
much more effective, but only if there is enough DNA for accurate testing, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The hair shaft -- the part that protrudes above the skin -- contains virtually 
no DNA and is essentially useless, Billings said. DNA is contained only in the 
root of the hair, the follicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Tuesday that they have both hair shafts and follicles to 
examine. But analysis of a single hair, even if the root is present, is an 
"iffy" proposition, according Mark Stolorow, director of operations for 
Cellmark Ltd. in Germantown, Md., one of the leading laboratories in DNA 
fingerprinting. "Not all DNA tests on hair roots are going to give 
interpretable results because of the wide variations in DNA concentrations (in 
the roots). But there is at least an even chance that you can get an 
interpretable result." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the small amount of DNA present in the hair root, laboratories use 
a different analytical technique on hair. The method is slightly faster than 
conventional DNA fingerprinting -- taking about four weeks, compared to eight 
to 10 weeks for conventional testing -- but the results have so far been 
accepted in only a few courts, primarily in the East, Billings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood testing is generally more precise than the test performed on hair 
samples, and preliminary DNA tests on some of the blood samples already have 
been conducted. Although those results will not figure in the preliminary 
hearing, Kennedy-Powell ordered Clark to turn the results over to Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 In agreeing to do so, Clark noted that some tests have yet to be performed, in 
part because investigators have not had a chance to thoroughly examine all of 
the more than 60 pieces of evidence gathered. Clark said prosecutors expect to 
spend at least a week presenting their evidence at the preliminary hearing, and 
Shapiro has said that Simpson may offer a defense -- an unusual tactic for a 
preliminary hearing that could greatly extend its length. 
</P>
<P>
 Former federal prosecutor John Shepard Wiley Jr., a UCLA law professor and an 
expert in evidence, said the blood test results that will figure prominently at 
the preliminary hearing may be important at that stage, but will not be "the 
main event" at a trial for Simpson if he is bound over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DNA will definitely be the large prize the prosecution is seeking," he 
said, while adding that the results also could turn against prosecutors if they 
point to another suspect. "The defense could establish that there was some 
human being other than O.J. Simpson at the murder scene. That's not conclusive, 
but it is extremely powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the hair samples, Wiley said, they would provide powerful evidence only 
if the prosecution can show that the hat was left there during the crime and 
not during an earlier visit. 
</P>
<P>
 While the case heads to court for the first public unveiling of the evidence, 
much attention has focused on exactly when the murders occurred. Pinpointing 
the time is important to both sides because Simpson's lawyers have said that he 
was at home when the killings occurred and that he could not have had time to 
commit the crimes and still be home in time to meet a limousine that arrived to 
take him to the airport for an 11:45 p.m. flight. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's report suggested that Nicole Simpson was still alive and speaking 
to her mother on the telephone about 11 p.m. One of Simpson's attorneys, F. Lee 
Bailey, quickly jumped on that information to assert that his client could not 
have committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report was contradicted Monday by Nicole Simpson's father, Louis 
Brown, who said the conversation actually occurred closer to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who has commented at length about the case in recent days, was 
unavailable Tuesday to respond to the comments by Nicole Simpson's father. An 
assistant said he was halting all public statements for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department officials would not comment on whether they have obtained 
phone records that would reveal the exact time of the call. Phone company 
officials also declined to discuss the issue in detail, even to confirm or deny 
whether they have received a search warrant for the records. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Cox, state manager of public affairs for GTE California, said the 
company routinely complies with such court orders but that it usually takes at 
least five working days to produce the information. In very special 
circumstances, usually in cases involving criminal charges, the company also 
releases early billing information to the customer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise, we are specifically precluded from releasing that information," 
Cox said. "We take protecting our customers' phone records very seriously."

HAITI REFUGEE SURGE STRAINS U.S. FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Encouraged by reports of more lenient treatment by U.S. immigration officers, 
nearly 3,000 Haitian refugees have set sail in recent days for the United 
States, swamping the ship-borne processing arrangement that the Clinton 
Administration set up to handle a much smaller number. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, President Clinton ordered the reopening of a refugee center at 
the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba to cope with the unexpected surge 
of Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard said it picked up 1,486 Haitians on the high seas Monday, the 
highest one-day total yet recorded, and 786 over the weekend. Coast Guard crews 
intercepted at least 20 more refugee boats Tuesday and picked up at least 612 
more emigrants -- "but we're still counting," spokesman Jack O'Dell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day total of at least 2,884 was more than the number of Haitian 
refugees intercepted in all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in refugees took U.S. officials by surprise and prompted 
President Clinton to convene an emergency meeting to find ways to handle the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, as he has done on many previous occasions, appealed to Haitians 
to remain in their country while applying for asylum. "I would note that the 
safest and best thing . . . to do is to apply at the in-country processing 
center," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a significant increase in refugees, perhaps as a result of 
political repression in Haiti and perhaps (because of) anxiety over tougher 
sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials said a more immediate cause appeared to be reports 
sweeping Haiti that U.S. officials are under orders to grant political asylum 
to more refugees than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials confirmed that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has been 
granting formal refugee status to a much higher percentage of Haitians than 
before Clinton revised his policies last month. But they said the change was 
not deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, Clinton revamped his Haitian refugee policy -- changing its focus 
from returning Haitians forcibly to their homeland to setting up three 
shipboard processing centers in Jamaica. But if the new policy has the 
unintended result of encouraging an even larger exodus than before, Clinton 
will suffer yet another embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said that the proportion of Haitian 
applicants granted refugee status has soared as high as 40% in recent weeks, 
compared with 5% earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said part of the change probably is attributable to increased work by 
private human rights groups that help Haitians apply for refugee status, which 
requires that an applicant prove "a well-founded fear of persecution." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor, he said, is that the INS has focused on processing "those who 
have got the best case" for refugee status, a practice that may inflate the 
percentage admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard L. Kenney, an INS spokesman, said the agency also may be approving 
more Haitian applications because of "better training and better information 
about conditions on Haiti." Previously, human rights groups had accused the INS 
of turning down too many Haitians who had good cases for refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kenney insisted there has been no general order to the INS to approve more 
Haitian applications. "There has been no direction like that," he said. "There 
are a lot of variables that go into these numbers. . . . Asylum isn't a 
mathematical process. It's a one-on-one process. Those percentages don't have 
anything to do with anyone's chances of being approved." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all emigrants who are approved as refugees are admitted to the United 
States, he noted. The Administration has been seeking help from other countries 
in settling certified refugees. And the Coast Guard is still returning hundreds 
of Haitians to their homeland each week -- those who fail to convince INS 
officials that they are fleeing political persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, officials said, reports of the increased percentage approved for 
refugee status already have circulated around Haiti and appeared to be 
encouraging more people to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. reporters in Haiti say emigrants are increasingly heading to sea in boats 
as small as 30 feet -- suggesting that they are not aiming to make the 700-mile 
voyage to Florida but merely are trying to get far enough for the Coast Guard 
to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard has 15 cutters and patrol boats ferrying refugees to a U.S. 
Navy hospital ship and two leased Ukrainian passenger liners anchored off 
Kingston, Jamaica. There, the refugees are interviewed by INS and U.N. 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's exiled president, said he cannot ask his 
countrymen to stop fleeing while a military dictatorship rules. "Given the 
escalating violence and repression, it would be immoral to ask people whose 
very lives are at risk to stay in Haiti," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, who has given conflicting statements in recent weeks over whether he 
would support U.S. military intervention to topple the military regime, refused 
to give a clear answer to the question Tuesday in a session at the National 
Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democracy must be restored, not through military intervention, but through 
the implementation of the (1992) Governor's Island agreement," under which the 
military agreed to step down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about reports from Haiti that Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military 
strongman, may retire from his post in October, opening the way for a possible 
compromise solution to the impasse, Aristide rejected the idea as "a . . . 
maneuver to waste time." 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman McCurry also dismissed rumors of Cedras' retirement 
as "singularly unimpressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's special ambassador for the Haitian issue, former Rep. William H. 
Gray III, told a Senate subcommittee that the Administration believes 
stepped-up economic sanctions have had some effect in shaking the military 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing signs of progress in the last four weeks," Gray told a 
subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "There are clear signs 
of dissatisfaction in the military. There are clear signs among supporters of 
the coup; some have even called for the coup leadership to step down. That has 
never happened before until we started tightening the sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said the Administration would continue tightening sanctions and indicated 
that the next step would be to cancel all non-immigrant U.S. visas now held by 
Haitian citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the sanctions fail, he warned, the Administration might turn to 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the military option on the table? Yes, it is," he said. "Is there an 
imminent action about to be taken? No, it is not. But that option is there on 
the table and we will assess the effect of sanctions each day, each week, to 
see if there is a change in the Haitian situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the United Nations, U.S. diplomats introduced a resolution that 
called for an expansion of the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Haiti "after the 
departure of the senior Haitian military leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, discussed by the Security Council in closed-door 
consultations, would ask Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to propose 
plans by July 15 for a force large enough to help "assure order," provide 
security for democratic government officials and organize legislative 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, an ambassador said that some of his colleagues on the 
council were uneasy with the resolution because they did not know if the United 
States was, in effect, asking them to authorize a U.N. follow-up operation to a 
possible U.S. invasion of Haiti.

NEW UV INDEX TO GAUGE SUN'S DAMAGING RAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weather watchers, especially those with a tendency to sunburn, soon will have 
another index to consider when planning their outdoor activities: the solar 
ultraviolet radiation level. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, the National Weather Service forecast will tally the strength 
of the day's rays in 58 cities, including Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 With ultraviolet radiation from the sun now considered a culprit in a host of 
health problems, including skin cancer and cataracts, the new index will allow 
urbanites to take action to reduce their risks. The UV Index forecast will 
predict noontime UV exposures, when the sun's damaging rays are at their 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the sunny Los Angeles area today face an exposure index of 9 on a 
scale of 1 to 10, considered "high" but just short of "very high." An index of 
1 or 2 indicates minimal exposure risk, with low-level exposure risk at 3 and 
4, and moderate exposure risk at 5 and 6. Ratings of 7, 8 and 9 are considered 
high, with elevated risks of sunburn and other damage for those not protected. 
</P>
<P>
 The new forecasts will be available daily to meteorologists as part of the 
standard package of weather indicators that they receive from the Weather 
Service. The new program was announced Tuesday by the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- parent agency 
of the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is modeled on one started in Canada two years ago, with apparently 
dramatic success. Eight in 10 Canadians since have told pollsters that they are 
aware of the government's ultraviolet forecast and half of those surveyed said 
they have changed their behavior based on it by staying inside, covering up or 
using sunscreen. In fact, the program appeared to prompt a boost in sales of 
such protective lotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials predicted that by encouraging such precautions, the new forecasts 
might stem the dizzying rise of skin cancers and cataracts in the United 
States. Scientists believe that the rise in such illnesses may be attributed to 
a progressive thinning of a protective layer of ozone in the Earth's upper 
atmosphere. They have urged steps both to protect that layer from further 
erosion from man-made chemicals and to warn people that they may be more 
vulnerable to the sun's damaging rays. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, skin cancer has become the fastest-growing form of cancer, 
with more than 700,000 new cases each year. And 1.2 million cases of cataracts 
are diagnosed yearly in the United States, making the eye disease the most 
costly single item in Medicare spending. Excessive exposure to the sun also is 
believed to cause premature aging of the skin and to affect the body's ability 
to fight off diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "This forecast is a public education tool and it's generally to increase 
awareness of the risks of exposure to UV rays," said Stephen Seidel, of the 
EPA. "That's the real value of the program: It becomes part of your 
consciousness, hopefully." 
</P>
<P>
 But a warning to all who have been caught in the rain without an umbrella: The 
forecasts are still in the experimental stage because scientists don't know yet 
how to predict with precision the strength of ultraviolet radiation through 
such meteorological obstacles as clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Elbert W. Friday Jr., director of the National Weather Service, said that 
meteorologists in his agency will use satellites, ground-based weather 
observations and computer models to generate a picture of a city's UV exposure 
at ground level about 30 hours in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Seidel said that the index should be especially useful to parents of young 
children, who face particular dangers from exposure to ultraviolet rays. 
Because children spend more of their time outdoors than adults do, about 80% of 
their lifetime exposure to UV rays occurs before they turn 18. And it is 
cumulative lifetime exposure to UV rays that appears to increase one's risk of 
developing skin cancers or cataracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative may not be a hit with everyone, however. Los Angeles weatherman 
Dallas Raines said that he will not use the new index in his broadcasts, 
because he does not think it communicates useful information. 
</P>
<P>
 "My time is so short on the air. That's the last thing I need is to take 15 
more seconds out of my time just showing someone an index figure," said Raines, 
a meteorologist for KABC-TV. "I'm not one to try to scare people. I'd rather 
explain to them what this means and why UV rays are dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times begins publishing the index on its weather page today. Dangerous 
Rays 
</P>
<P>
 The ultraviolet radiation index is developed using satellite instruments to 
measure the amount of ozone in the upper atmosphere. The ozone layer blocks 
incoming UV radiation but thin seasonally. Here is Tuesday's index for selected 
cities: 
</P>
<P>
 EXPOSURE INDEX 
</P>
<P>
 Minimal: 0-2 
</P>
<P>
 Very fair people may burn in 30 minutes 
</P>
<P>
 Low: 3-4 
</P>
<P>
 Danger range 15-20 minutes for fair complexions 
</P>
<P>
 Moderate: 5-6 
</P>
<P>
 Fair complexions safe for 10-12 minutes 
</P>
<P>
 High: 7-9 
</P>
<P>
 Safe time only 7-8 minutes for fair complexions 
</P>
<P>
 Very High: 10+ 
</P>
<P>

HOUSE REWRITES PHONE, CABLE RULES; COMMUNICATIONS: BILL TO EASE 'BABY BELL' 
RESTRICTIONS AND LET TELEPHONE FIRMS DELIVER TV SHOWS PASSES ALMOST 
UNANIMOUSLY. MEASURE'S FATE IN THE SENATE IS UNCERTAIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Ending years of delay and deadlock, the House on Tuesday adopted landmark 
legislation that rewrites the rules governing the communications industry, 
paving the way for an era of reduced regulation and increased competition among 
telephone companies and cable television operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers from across the ideological spectrum joined in support of two 
companion bills that represent the most fundamental change in federal rules for 
communications firms since the depths of the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legislation faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where 
long-distance telephone companies are expected to mount a spirited attack. The 
House bills sweep away the rules that bar the big local telephone firms -- 
known as regional Bell operating companies -- from providing long-distance 
services and manufacturing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the future of a $300-billion industry that is in the midst of a 
technological upheaval, one that has made it possible for phone companies, 
cable operators, satellite manufacturers and even two-way radio operators to 
offer similar services. 
</P>
<P>
 "By removing barriers that protect industries from each other, the bill will 
force companies to be more aggressive about defending their markets and moving 
into others' markets," says Eli Noam, director of Columbia University's 
Institute for Tele-Information. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional phone companies have promised to spend billions of dollars on new 
fiber-optic cables and other equipment if they are allowed to compete openly 
with long-distance providers and offer cable television services. The Clinton 
Administration has made the development of an advanced telecommunications 
infrastructure -- which will potentially make a host of new information 
services available to every home -- a major political priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to build the information superhighway," said Rep. Michael G. 
Oxley (R-Ohio), and Rep. W. J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.) said: "The consumer is 
the big winner today." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the legislation sailed through the House with near-unanimous support, 
the expected battle in the Senate could prevent final passage of any 
legislation this year. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the Senate 
Commerce Committee, predicted quick approval of his own, different bill in the 
Senate after the 4th of July recess, setting the stage for Senate-House 
negotiations on a compromise version before Congress quits for the year in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Democrats and Republicans united in praising a breakthrough 
agreement between two powerful barons, Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee, and Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 They resolved their lengthy jurisdictional dispute and agreed on a bill that 
would rewrite the judicial consent decree that broke up the Bell telephone 
system 10 years ago, giving birth to the seven "Baby Bells" but barring them 
from long-distance service or manufacture of phone equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 This measure, approved 423 to 5, would allow the Baby Bells greater freedom to 
provide long-distance service and to produce equipment, subject to Justice 
Department supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few Bell companies are expected to become major manufacturers, all 
are eager to tap the $70-billion long-distance market. Bell company-backed 
studies say competition in that market could save consumers $30 billion over a 
10-year period as a result of lower phone rates -- but long-distance carriers 
say the Bell companies will have an unfair advantage by virtue of their control 
over local circuits. 
</P>
<P>
 A second bill, approved 423 to 4, would force local telephone companies to 
make their phone lines available to rival firms, thus setting the stage for 
competition in the local phone business. The bill will also allow phone 
companies to provide television programming by wire, competing with cable 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone companies say they need to have a stab at the $21-billion cable 
television business if they are to justify spending huge sums to extend 
high-capacity lines to every home. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the lack of opposition, the two bills were put on the fast-track 
"suspension calender," which required a two-thirds vote of the House for 
passage and barred any amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most comprehensive telecommunications legislation brought to the 
House floor in 60 years," said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.). He alluded to 
the Federal Communications Act of 1934, which established a regulatory system 
that existed for 50 years before a federal court ruling broke up the virtual 
monopoly enjoyed by the old American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and its 
subsidiary operating companies. 
</P>
<P>
 House Majority Whip David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) and his Republican counterpart, 
Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, showed rare agreement in praising the 
legislation as a job-creating bill that demonstrated the value of 
bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional Bell firms hailed the House action. Pacific Telesis Vice 
President Ronald F. Stowe said the legislation represents "a dramatic step 
toward ensuring that all Americans will benefit from the new age of advanced 
communications," by bringing significantly lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis has announced plans to spend about $5.3 billion to link 5.5 
million California homes with broad-band networks by the year 2000 but has 
warned that failure of the Legislature to act could result in scaled-back 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Brooks-Dingell bill, the Baby Bell companies would be allowed to 
engage in manufacturing activities and long-distance services within a year 
after the law is enacted, subject to approval by the FCC and the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Bell companies would be allowed to provide long-distance 
services within a state, subject to state approval, with the Justice Department 
retaining the ability to challenge these services if it finds they are 
anti-competitive. The California Public Utilities Commission has stated its 
intention to allow such competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional Bells could offer interstate long-distance only if the FCC and 
the Justice Department certified that they would not hinder competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance operators point out that it could be many years before real 
competition exists in the $90-billion local phone exchange business and insist 
that the Bells should be regulated to allow such competition to develop. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the Bell companies still have a monopoly in local 
telecommunications, they will have the power to abuse customers and competitors 
alike," MCI said. Officials at MCI and AT&T are looking for the Senate bill to 
set a far stricter standard on allowing the Bells to enter the long-distance 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill also would establish rules for Bell companies to provide 
electronic publishing services, such as the sale over telephone lines of news, 
financial reports and public records, with the rules scheduled to expire in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the Baby Bells could provide electronic publishing only if 
they did so through a separate affiliate or a joint venture, without any joint 
sales, advertising or marketing activities with the affiliated organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The other bill, sponsored by Markey and Rep. Jack Fields (R-Tex.), would 
require that local phone companies allow competitors -- such as cable companies 
-- access to their telephone lines. It also would override state and local laws 
or regulations that ban or restrict local telephone competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone companies would be allowed to operate cable television systems -- 
but not permitted to buy existing cable companies in their service areas. 
Similarly, cable firms would be allowed to enter the telephone business. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The House passed two measures that radically change the way telecommunications 
services are regulated. The bills alter the Communications Act of 1934 and 
eliminate restrictions on the regional Bell operating companies that were 
imposed by the consent decree governing the 1984 breakup of AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 BROOKS-DINGELL BILL 
</P>
<P>
 * Permits regional Bell operating companies to provide long-distance telephone 
services. Services needed to provide audio and video programming and wireless 
services would be permitted immediately. Intrastate long-distance services 
would be permitted if the state approves and the Justice Department does not 
object. Interstate services would require FCC and Justice Department approval. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permits Bell companies to manufacture telecommunications equipment, provided 
the Justice Department does not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permits Bell companies to provide electronic information services over their 
own networks but only through separate subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bars Bell companies from using telephone account information to market other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 MARKEY-FIELDS BILL 
</P>
<P>
 * Opens local telephone service to competition by requiring local phone 
companies to offer network connections to competitors, including cable 
television companies. Also overrides many state and local laws that forbid 
local phone competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permits telephone companies to provide cable television services through 
separate subsidiaries but bars phone companies from buying existing cable 
systems within their service areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishes a federal/state board to develop ways to assure low-cost phone 
service for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requires FCC to review current restrictions on the number of radio and 
television stations any one person may own.

PANETTA VOWS TO BRING DISCIPLINE TO WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leon E. Panetta, President Clinton's newly named chief of staff, vowed Tuesday 
to bring to the White House and to the President a tough new brand of 
discipline to help Clinton achieve health care reform this year and meet 
Republican challenges in the midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta stressed that, before agreeing to accept the new post, he requested 
and received a pledge of full trust and confidence from Clinton, as well as 
authority to make changes that he considers necessary in a White House staff 
plagued by loose management. 
</P>
<P>
 The former California congressman and director of the White House Office of 
Management and Budget said he got similar assurances from First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, both major players in White House 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers are hoping that the shake-up will bring 
a new White House strategy for what appears to have become a make-or-break 
issue for Clinton's presidency: health care reform. What they want is a shift 
away from the Administration's hands-off posture in congressional negotiations 
and clearer signals about what Clinton will and will not accept as lawmakers 
struggle to fashion compromises on the complex and politically sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has grown so critical that one senior Democratic House aide, 
asked what the White House should be doing to salvage its health reform effort, 
answered only half-jokingly: "You mean, apart from starting all over next 
year?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, it was at the urging of congressional leaders that the 
Administration stood back from the early skirmishing in the five committees -- 
three in the House and two in the Senate -- that claim jurisdiction over health 
care. Now, however, the process has led to a dangerous drift, with some 
committees producing bills that differ drastically from one another and at 
least one being unable to produce any legislation at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional leaders in the health care fight are hoping that Panetta will 
recognize the weaknesses of that strategy and assert control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to need a very active role for the White House in these crucial 
negotiations," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), a member of the House Democratic 
leadership: "The White House has been a little too disengaged on health care. 
It needs to dirty its hands a little more. You can't expect the Congress to go 
into uncharted waters with no direction. That's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvaging health care is clearly Panetta's top priority. If the White House 
fails to mount an effective campaign to achieve what Clinton has made his top 
domestic priority, then nothing Panetta might do to increase managerial 
efficiency is likely to matter much. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, soon after leaving his post as budget director in mid-July 
to succeed Thomas (Mack) McLarty as chief of staff, Panetta will evaluate the 
White House staff and recommend changes to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said he will thoroughly review all White House operations and evaluate 
the strengths and weaknesses of key personnel. He declined to say what 
personnel changes he has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 When interviewed jointly with McLarty on a television show, Panetta was asked 
whether he intended to bring in his own press secretary. "Obviously I'm going 
to bring in some of my own people to try to assist me in that effort, sure," he 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
 McLarty was then asked whether Dee Dee Myers might be replaced as White House 
press secretary. He said he would be working with Panetta on such decisions 
"but ultimately Leon has to get the team in place that he feels is the right 
team for the White House at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Panetta made no further comment, it was widely construed that he 
intends to replace the first woman to serve as White House press secretary. 
White House sources later said that Panetta has no plans to replace her. 
Panetta and McLarty, who will become counselor to the President, were greeted 
by applause at the White House Tuesday when they sat side by side for the first 
time at the regularly scheduled senior staff meeting. Some aides have expressed 
relief that their new chief, an experienced Washington hand, is likely to bring 
more efficiency to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt that Panetta will be a much tougher boss than McLarty, a 
Clinton boyhood friend from Arkansas who was considered too nice and 
accommodating, as well as too inexperienced, to be an effective chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In an hourlong luncheon session with reporters and in several television 
interviews, Panetta said he would bring the same tough discipline he 
demonstrated at the budget office to the White House staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be tough every day in dealing with the budget," he declared. 
"You've got to be able to say 'no' to various departments, various agencies, to 
the Congress. You've got to try to ride a tough road -- and I've been able to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Clinton always gave him full authority on budget issues and followed 
his recommendations, Panetta said, he is confident that he will have the same 
kind of relationship with the President as chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 McLarty had been reluctant to make personnel changes and some aides questioned 
whether Clinton had authorized him to do so. Panetta said that authority to 
make staff changes, whether incremental or more extensive, was an "absolutely 
essential condition" of his accepting the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta indicated that he would try to manage in the style of James A. Baker 
III, who served as one of President Ronald Reagan's chiefs of staff and briefly 
served as chief of staff for President George Bush. Baker, Panetta said, "had 
the trust and confidence of the President and basically ran a tight ship." As 
chairman of the House Budget Committee during the 1980s, Panetta worked with 
Baker on budget issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Clinton's fellow Democrats -- even some of his own aides -- have 
described the President as undisciplined and as the primary cause of loose 
management at the White House. Panetta told reporters at the luncheon session 
that part of his role in serving the President "will be to see that he gets 
that discipline" so that he will have more time to focus on major issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said his own focus will be "on putting the office of the presidency 
together and serving the Presient in the best way I can. And you can bet that 
whether I'm stubborn or whether I'm nice or whether I'm mean, whatever those 
qualities may ultimately be, that's the direction I'm going to be pointed at. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President does not want to waste his time having to deal with management 
issues in the White House," Panetta declared. "He really does want to focus on 
the issues that impact the country. He's got to face a lot of tough issues 
during the day and that's what he wants to focus on and that's what I hope to 
do is give him the room so that he in fact can be President and doesn't have to 
waste time being manager at the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's loose management style has existed since his 12 years as Arkansas 
governor, however. And a number of lawmakers said that Panetta's success or 
failure will depend on whether, after such entrenched habits, Clinton is 
willing to adjust to a more focused and disciplined management style. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the key things of that job (chief of staff) is being able to boss the 
President some and I don't know if anyone can do that," said Sen. John H. 
Chafee (R-R.I.), a moderate who shares Clinton's goal of producing a health 
care plan that guarantees coverage for every American. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Clinton unquestionably faces an uphill fight on health care, Panetta 
expressed confidence that Congress will pass it, along with two other major 
measures: a crime bill and legislation implementing the new World Trade 
Organization, which will succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Although political analysts generally believe the Republicans will make 
substantial gains in November's congressional elections, Panetta said that, if 
those three major pieces of legislation pass, "I think we can bring a helluva 
legislative report to the American people and that's what gives you momentum in 
an election."

AID FRAUD CRACKDOWN WIDENED; WELFARE: ORANGE COUNTY APPROVES $1.3 MILLION TO 
FINGERPRINT RECIPIENTS AND CHECK THEM IN COMPUTER SHARED WITH L.A. COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to stop people from registering more than once for General 
Relief, the Orange County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to spend $1.3 
million on a program to fingerprint aid applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is expected to save an estimated $64,000 over 4 1/2 years -- with 
possible expansion and greater savings down the road, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no choice," said Angelo Doti, director of financial assistance in the 
county Department of Social Services. "I think this is the forerunner of what 
will sweep the nation for public assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in mid-September or October, people applying for General Relief in 
Orange County and those already on the rolls will be fingerprinted. Their 
prints will be run through a computer system shared with Los Angeles County to 
check that they are not already receiving aid in either county. 
</P>
<P>
 The fingerprinting would apply only to the 3,600 single adults on General 
Relief in Orange County. But the concept probably will be expanded to other aid 
recipients, including the nearly 40,000 parents of children on welfare, Doti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Los Angeles County, which has been fingerprinting General Relief 
recipients for three years, started including adult recipients in the Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children program as part of a state demonstration 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the new program's success will be its link with the existing 
program in Los Angeles County, said Arnold Winkle, Orange County's 
administrative manager of information systems. He estimated that 60% of the 
savings will come from catching Los Angeles County residents who illegally 
apply for general assistance using false identification. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County program, run by Electronic Data Systems Corp, has saved 
about $2 million since June, 1991, said Lisa Nunez, chief of the computer 
services division of the county Public Social Services Department.

HEAT WAVE, 8 WILDFIRES STILL BURNING IN SOUTHLAND; WEATHER: FOUR BLAZES ARE 
LARGELY UNDER CONTROL, BUT TWO IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY POSE PROBLEMS. FORECASTERS 
SAY HOLIDAY WEEKEND COULD BE COOLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Firefighters sweltered in the furnace temperatures of a persistent heat wave 
Tuesday as at least eight wildfires burned through the rugged backcountry of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the fires -- near Wrightwood, Soledad Pass, Cabazon and the Gibbel 
Road area south of Hemet -- were largely controlled by Tuesday afternoon, but 
four more continued to rage across slopes and canyons covered with grass, brush 
and timber. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hot and terrible out there," said Jim Bouchard, a spokesman for the 
California Department of Forestry. "It's right around 100 degrees in most of 
the fire areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard said the fires causing the biggest problems were both in Riverside 
County -- a 3,500-acre blaze near Anza and a fire that had blackened about 
1,200 acres above Gilman Road on North Mountain, north of Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
 "That fire near Anza isn't playing by the rules," Bouchard said. "The brush 
there is 30 to 40 feet tall and hasn't burned in 50 years, the winds keep 
shifting, and there aren't any roads giving us access to where it's burning. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "The people we have out there have been fighting that fire for three days," he 
said. "They're getting tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard said a flare-up on the west flank of the blaze Tuesday morning 
threatened a number of homes "and threw quite a scare into some of the local 
residents," but firefighters beat back the flames and all the structures were 
saved, except for one small mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight firefighters were injured in the Anza blaze -- six of them succumbing to 
the heat, one suffering from smoke inhalation and one suffering minor burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Full control of the fire was not expected until Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchard said the mountainside fire above Gilman Road was still moving briskly 
Tuesday, and although officials were predicting full containment by early this 
morning, "that's being pretty optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem there is that the mountain is straight up and straight down, with 
no access roads between the top and the bottom," Bouchard said. "That fire is 
damned near impossible to get to." 
</P>
<P>
 Three other brush blazes were burning Tuesday in Riverside County -- the 
1,000-acre Fairview Road fire southeast of Hemet, the 300-acre Matthews Road 
fire on the Morongo Indian Reservation near Cabazon and the 3,500-acre Gibbel 
Road fire south of Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
 The troublesome Fairview blaze, which was working its way slowly through thick 
brush on rugged hillsides above Bautista Canyon, has been blamed on an 
arsonist, the Department of Forestry said. Officials said that because of the 
inaccessible terrain, the blaze was being fought primarily with helicopters and 
air tankers. Full containment was not expected until today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matthews fire, which was largely contained by Tuesday night, briefly 
threatened a number of structures on the reservation, but none were lost. 
Bouchard said the blaze started when a small fire set to incinerate debris 
suddenly burst out of control. Full control was expected by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Fairview blaze, the Gibbel fire was deliberately set, Bouchard said. 
Although the Gibbel fire spread rapidly, about 300 firefighters working the 
lines contained more than 90% of the blaze by Tuesday night, with full control 
predicted sometime today. 
</P>
<P>
 Two blazes in Los Angeles County -- the 3,000-acre Wrightwood fire and the 
3,500-acre Soledad Pass fire south of Palmdale -- were more than 95% contained 
by Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaquie Stiver, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service, said the destructive 
Wrightwood fire should be fully controlled by this afternoon, "but it's not 
over till it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still quite windy up there," she said, "so everybody there is sitting on 
edge." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wrightwood fire -- started last weekend by a campfire -- burned 10 homes, 
incinerated at least 50 cars and trucks and injured eight firefighters. 
</P>

 The Soledad fire, ignited during the weekend by a ricocheting tracer bullet, 
was fully contained Tuesday evening. "Right now, that one's looking pretty 
nice," Stiver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not looking quite as nice was another fire that started during the weekend -- 
a 4,500-acre blaze in the Cleveland National Forest near the San Diego County 
town of Ramona. While the 1,400 firefighters there were said to be making some 
progress, the blaze was only 40% contained by Tuesday night and full control 
was not expected until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said more hot weather over the next few days probably will not 
help firefighters much, but a cooling trend could set in by the long Fourth of 
July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dome of high pressure over the Southwest is beginning to weaken, and 
that's letting a little bit of cool air start moving in from the ocean," said 
WeatherData Inc. meteorologist Curtis Brack. "Wednesday and Thursday will be 
hot -- pretty much the same as Tuesday -- but it could cool off as much as 5 to 
10 degrees by Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 The high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Tuesday was 89 
degrees, 7 degrees cooler than forecast and 5 degrees below Monday's top 
reading of 94. Tuesday's overnight low was 71, which meant that for the second 
day in a row, the record for the warmest minimum was tied. The record of 71 
degrees for a June 28 was set in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Other high temperatures Tuesday included 103 in Newhall, 101 in Woodland 
Hills, 99 in Monrovia, 97 in Pasadena, 92 in Montebello, 85 in Santa Ana, 82 in 
Torrance and 71 at Santa Monica Pier. Feeding the Furnace

PANEL OKS PADDLING FOR GRAFFITI VANDALISM; LEGISLATION: ASSEMBLY BILL WOULD 
ALLOW FOUR TO 10 WHACKS IN COURT. SPEAKER BROWN VOWS TO KILL THE MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prodded by growing public dismay over graffiti, a key Assembly committee 
approved a landmark bill Tuesday allowing Juvenile Court judges to punish 
youthful taggers by ordering that they be whacked up to 10 times with a wooden 
paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 If enacted, the measure would reinstitute court-ordered corporal punishment in 
the United States for the first time in more than four decades, legal scholars 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Public Safety Committee voted 4 to 1 for the bill by Assemblyman 
Mickey Conroy, an Orange County Republican who was inspired by the caning in 
Singapore of an American teen-ager accused of spray-painting cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's measure appeared to face long odds in the Public Safety Committee, 
which historically has been a graveyard for Republican crime bills. But two 
Democrats joined with a pair of Republicans to push the legislation forward. 
</P>
<P>
 It still must survive another committee hearing and an Assembly floor vote, 
where Speaker Willie Brown has vowed to defeat the bill, before it can move to 
the Senate. Gov. Pete Wilson has indicated his support for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Safety Committee added a sunset clause requiring the Legislature to 
renew its approval after paddling is given a three-year trial run. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee endorsed the measure despite vocal opposition from the American 
Civil Liberties Union and other foes, who questioned the measure's 
constitutionality and effectiveness while calling Conroy's effort election-year 
posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beating of offenders as a form of punishment runs contrary to the 
fundamental notions of decency in our justice system," said Francisco Lobaco, 
ACLU legislative director. "It's really not the way to solve the issue. 
State-sponsored violence is not an answer or a solution. I think it's a 
horrible idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Dreyfuss, legislative advocate for California Attorneys for Criminal 
Justice, described the bill as "court-sanctioned child abuse." MaryAnn Memmer 
of the California PTA said Conroy's proposed punishment would prove profoundly 
ineffective: "Hard-core gang criminals will not be deterred by a swat from a 
paddle." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, however, portrayed his legislation as a firm way to steer errant 
youths away from destructive, gang-related activities such as violence and 
drugs. He also cited the high cost of graffiti cleanup and paraded half a dozen 
experts before the committee to provide vivid testimony about the violent 
intentions gang members sometimes express through graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "By spraying their gang markings and taggings all over their communities, 
these hoodlums commit the worst of all crimes possible -- they create an 
environment of fear and despair for the innocent, law-abiding citizens living 
in these afflicted neighborhoods and communities," Conroy said. "As many 
residents who live in such areas will tell you, once the graffiti moves into 
their communities, the crime and violence is quick to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy contends that traditional forms of punishment, such as putting juvenile 
offenders in California Youth Authority facilities, are seen by hardened 
teen-agers as a badge of honor and do little to curb graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's bill would allow a judge to order a parent to deliver four to 10 
strokes with a wooden paddle in the courtroom. If the parent declined or the 
judge found the spanking unsatisfactory, a bailiff would do the paddling. The 
paddle would be 3/4 of an inch thick, 18 inches long and 6 inches wide, with a 
6-inch handle. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bill requires that the names of juvenile offenders who get 
the paddle be made public, a tactic designed to heighten the humiliation and 
deter other would-be taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy began pursuing the idea after being prodded by constituents and staff 
members caught up in the highly publicized debate over the Singapore case. 
Michael Fay, an 18-year-old high school senior from Dayton, Ohio, got four 
strokes of a rattan cane May 5 after being found guilty of vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics worry that Conroy's proposal and similar ideas circulating in 
Florida, Maryland and Texas could begin to tug the country back toward a style 
of courtroom punishment abandoned decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Many critics cite research showing that corporal punishment can lead to 
embitterment, anger and post-traumatic stress while teaching impressionable 
youths the contradictory lesson that violence is the way to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The constitutionality of Conroy's bill remains in the eye of the beholder. The 
California legislative counsel's office, which provides legal opinions to state 
legislators, said Conroy's bill is unconstitutional, but the staff counsel for 
the Public Safety Committee said that the issue remains "an open question" and 
that there is "no bright line" setting the limit for what is cruel and unusual 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy also has been particularly optimistic because U.S. Supreme Court 
Justice Antonin Scalia predicted in a recent talk that caning, a far more 
brutal form of punishment than paddling, could pass the high court's muster.

ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS DISCUSS EXPANDING PLO'S AUTHORITY; AUTONOMY: GOVERNMENT 
PRAISES ARAB PROGRESS TOWARD SELF-RULE, LACK OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on Tuesday began what are 
expected to be complex, difficult negotiations on broadening the powers of the 
new Palestinian Authority and extending self-government throughout the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Yossi Sarid, Israel's environment minister, praised the start made by the 
authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho district in the West Bank and said 
Israel is eager to expand the area governed by the Palestinians and thus 
maintain the momentum for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of political violence since autonomy began six weeks ago has 
encouraged Israel to accelerate the turnover of authority to the Palestinians, 
Sarid said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The better the situation is on the ground -- and it has surprised us in a 
positive way -- I'm sure it will encourage the government to move up the 
negotiations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jericho, Israeli Tourism Minister Uzi Baram said he expects Palestinians 
will soon take charge of tourism in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, the 
birthplace of Jesus, which draws about 1 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning Sarid's warm embrace at the Israeli administrative headquarters 
here, PLO negotiator Nabil Shaath said, "We have been friends for a long time 
and the objective of this meeting is political -- to exchange our ideas and the 
ideas of our leaders, to improve relations and to move forward in the peace 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath, now the senior minister here in the Palestinian Authority, said that, 
initially, the talks will focus on problems in implementing the self-government 
agreement signed last month, particularly the fate of the 4,000 to 6,000 
Palestinians still held by Israel. "The prisoners have become the most 
important problem in the psyche of the Palestinian people, and I think it's 
justified that we should really take a step toward solution," Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has prompted hunger strikes by prisoners, and PLO critics have 
accused the organization of not working to free opponents of the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel said it has freed 4,200 prisoners in the past two months but that 
hundreds stayed in prison or detention camps rather than renounce violence and 
accept the peace agreement. The PLO puts the number freed at 3,500. In all, 
5,000 prisoners were supposed to be released by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 The main issues of the talks, however, will be the Palestinian Authority's 
assumption of responsibility for education, health care, welfare, tourism and 
direct taxation across the whole West Bank and elections throughout the 
Palestinian territories. 
</P>
<P>
 These issues, difficult in themselves, require agreement on even tougher 
questions, including where the West Bank ends and Jerusalem begins, when the 
Palestinian police will start their deployment outside Jericho into the West 
Bank and when Israeli forces will withdraw from Palestinian towns and villages 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 While committed to transferring broad operating powers to the Palestinian 
Authority prior to elections, Israel is expected to encourage early balloting, 
now tentatively set for mid-October. That is because, once the elections are 
scheduled, there already is an agreed timetable for Israel's pulling back its 
forces and extending Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the PLO is still weighing the politics of seeking more interim powers or 
proceeding directly to the Palestinians' first national elections, accepting 
the uncertainty that such a process would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat will 
probably give the negotiators basic instructions when they meet in Paris on 
July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters in Jerusalem, Rabin said he would consider the Paris 
talks a success if he and Arafat make progress on widening the scope of 
Palestinian self-rule -- "in principle, to agree about the timetable and 
guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Rabin will also likely set the date for Arafat's arrival in Jericho 
and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is timing," Shaath said of Arafat's delayed arrival. "I hope we 
solve all the problems that have made it difficult for him to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat had been expected to arrive this month. He has given various reasons 
for his delayed arrival, including the failure of foreign donors to provide 
promised assistance. The Palestinians were promised an immediate $42 million of 
$600 million pledged by international donors to underwrite the first year of 
self-rule. But Shaath said they have not received it. Palestinian 
representatives are in Washington this week seeking a further $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, an Arab stabbed and seriously wounded a Jew on Tuesday, the 27th 
anniversary of Israel's annexation of the Arab eastern part of the city. The 
injured man was repairing his car in the Jewish neighborhood of Neve Yaacov on 
the east side. The attacker fled toward a nearby Arab village, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Bank town of Tulkarm, a Palestinian gunman broke into a home of an 
Arab suspected of collaborating with the Israeli occupation and opened fire, 
killing one man and wounding three others.

PRINCE CHARLES RAISES HACKLES WITH TV DOCUMENTARY; BRITAIN: IN PROGRAM AIRING 
TONIGHT, HE REPORTEDLY ADMITS TO ADULTERY AND SAYS, AS KING, HE WOULD DROP THE 
TITLE 'DEFENDER OF THE FAITH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, has created a whirlwind of 
controversy by his outspoken participation in a television documentary that is 
scheduled to air tonight but excerpts of which have already been leaked. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2 1/2-hour program, with broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, is frank to an 
unprecedented degree, with the prince reportedly admitting for the first time 
to committing adultery during his marriage to Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
 He also says in the documentary, marking the 25th anniversary of his 
investiture as Prince of Wales, that he wants to end the sovereign's role as 
head of the Church of England. He suggests this by noting that, if he became 
king, he would drop his traditional royal description as "defender of the 
faith," meaning the Church of England. He sees himself, instead, as a defender 
of all faiths in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Several religious commentators have criticized this view and said that it puts 
him at odds with the Establishment as well as his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcript of the documentary has been closely held, but one version was 
leaked to Independent Television News. Buckingham Palace and ITN say the final 
version is still subject to last-minute editing. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the program, Dimbleby reportedly asks Charles, 45, whether he was 
faithful to the princess. He answers "Yes," pauses and adds, "until it became 
clear that the marriage had irretrievably broken down." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no direct mention of Camilla Parker-Bowles, the woman with whom the 
prince is said to have conducted a long affair; an intimate telephone 
conversation between the two, with embarrassing sexual exchanges, was 
intercepted in 1989. Neither the prince nor Parker-Bowles has denied conducting 
that conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 The prince, in the documentary, reportedly does refer to Parker-Bowles and her 
husband, Brig. Andrew Parker-Bowles, as "dear friends." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is unclear when he thinks his marriage broke down. A raft of books and 
articles suggest that Charles maintained a close relationship with 
Parker-Bowles from the earliest days of his marriage. Popular speculation long 
has held that their relationship was a central reason for the breakup of his 
marriage, officially announced 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Princess Diana has reportedly told friends that her marriage was over, almost 
from the start, when she found that Charles was still in contact with 
Parker-Bowles, whom he had escorted before their engagement. The princess has 
also indicated to friends that they had not shared a bed since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the program, the prince, asked about the breakdown of his marriage, 
is said to have grown irritated and snapped: "Look, come on. It happens to half 
the country and it happened to me. It is not something I wanted to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Anglican churchmen, including George Austin, Archdeacon of York, have 
insisted that an heir to the throne who admitted infidelity could not take the 
coronation oath. But on Tuesday, Austin seemed to change his mind, declaring 
that if the affair was over, "I don't think there is a problem for the future. 
All Christians make mistakes and do things which are contrary to God's will." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rev. Tony Highton, a leading member of the General Synod, disagreed, 
arguing Tuesday: "From what I understand, there does not appear to be any hint 
of penitence. And that is going to cause him very serious problems. I, 
therefore, do not think he is fit to become defender of the faith and supreme 
governor of the Church of England." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Greenway, a Conservative member of Parliament, said bluntly, "You cannot 
hold several faiths at the same time, so the idea of becoming defender of all 
of them is absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many have applauded Charles for acknowledging the multiplicity of 
religious beliefs in modern British society, they have suggested he was asking 
for trouble in bringing up the issue today. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles also has been criticized for his decision to submit to the 
documentary, the filming of which lasted more than a year and was designed to 
improve his image with the British people. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Royal Family, critics and supporters have agreed, has been in dire 
need of a public relations boost as, in recent years, all the queen's married 
children have been divorced or separated. And the monarch herself has been 
forced to pay for the repair of fire-damaged Windsor Castle and to submit to 
income taxes on part of her holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the documentary, palace observers said Charles may have made a major 
misjudgment in speaking so openly in an exercise designed to win him support -- 
and that it could end up having the opposite effect.

POLITICS; CONGRESSIONAL DEAL-MAKER PROUDLY NAVIGATES MIDDLE GROUND; JOHN BREAUX 
IS AMONG VANISHING BREED OF LAWMAKERS WHO CAN SORT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE DIN 
TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you want to see what floats, says Sen. John B. Breaux, you just have to 
keep throwing things on the water. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few weeks, the Louisiana Democrat has tossed out four entirely 
different approaches to health care reform: First, he supported a plan that 
bets almost entirely on the free market. He switched to a scheme that would 
have the government require most employers to provide health insurance. Then he 
embraced a proposal that might have the government impose the so-called 
employer mandates. Now he favors a plan that does none of those things. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it politely, Breaux is flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also, at this stage of the game, indispensable. To President Clinton. To 
his fellow Democrats. To everyone who wants action this year on health care 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening rounds of any major debate over national policy belong to the big 
thinkers, to the leaders with broad vision, to the politicians who can sound 
trumpet calls and stir popular sentiment. The experts and policy architects 
come next, drafting blueprints for new systems and institutions. Others also 
play their roles -- from critiquing the plans to mobilizing the interest groups 
for and against. 
</P>
<P>
 But late in the game, often with disaster at hand, the likes of John Breaux 
take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In business, Breaux would be a "closer;" in chess, a master of the end game. 
In Congress, he represents a vanishing breed of legislator: those with the 
knack for threading their way through the purists, the ideologues, the 
unbending partisans, the special interests and political rivals to make things 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see myself not as a philosopher, but somebody who is interested in making 
government work," he said. "More and more people in Congress . . . have an 
all-or-nothing attitude. All-or-nothing attitudes generally wind up getting 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 With both the Congress and the presidency in the hands of Democrats, the era 
of gridlock was supposed to have ended. But this calculation did not take into 
account the array of special interests that can still bring the legislative 
machinery grinding to a halt on a question as complex as health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the 50-year-old Breaux, who -- more than anything -- is in it for the 
deal. And he is extraordinarily good at putting himself into the middle of one. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a rule of thumb, if you want to know where things are going to end up, 
just check where John Breaux is standing," said Lawrence O'Donnell Jr., the 
Senate Finance Committee's top Democratic staffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux rarely involves himself in the minutiae of legislation. He often turns 
unabashedly to staff members for answers to even the most basic questions about 
a proposal he is pushing. 
</P>
<P>
 He happily admits to being a dabbler and concedes that he knew almost nothing 
about health care -- until recently. "But I like the process. I like being 
involved in trying to legislate and reach agreements," he said. "I'm going to 
do some other issues. I'm going to do welfare next." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Breaux and his latest set of allies -- a small band of conservative 
Democrats and moderate Republicans on the Finance Committee -- stumbled through 
a series of complicated and unwieldy alternatives before coming up with a 
health care plan that falls short of meeting Clinton's bottom line of 
guaranteed health coverage for every American. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, they somehow achieved their goal: They got the process going 
again. Even the President's staunchest supporters on the Finance Committee say 
they may vote for the proposal, if only to avoid the embarrassment of having no 
bill at all to take to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it reaches the full Senate, yet another round of dealing will begin -- 
and Breaux is likely to be in the thick of it once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux and Clinton are friends and political soul mates from their days 
together in the moderate-to-conservative Democratic Leadership Council. Time 
after time, it has fallen to Breaux to tell the President that one or another 
of his policies would not succeed on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 When Breaux warned Clinton last year that his economic-stimulus package would 
die unless it were preceded by deficit reduction, Clinton brushed him aside, 
and suffered a devastating legislative defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Breaux sounded a similar alarm about Clinton's proposed BTU-based 
energy tax a few months later, the White House was more receptive. The 
Administration agreed instead to a gasoline tax, and it got one. 
</P>
<P>
 "On health care, I think (Clinton) is willing to compromise. I think he was 
willing to compromise on the jobs stimulus bill," Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he adds that some of those who advise the President "fall into the same 
trap as some Republicans do, that they have to have it all their way or not at 
all. If they don't get anything, then they have an issue, and let's run on the 
issue in the next election." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is not a middle ground on an issue, Breaux will make one. In May, he 
decided that Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Chairman Ernest F. 
Hollings (D-S.C.) was taking a far too regulatory approach to 
telecommunications legislation, so he introduced a bill that would allow the 
Baby Bells to enter the long-distance market without restriction. "That was an 
extreme position . . . but I did that in order to create the middle. If you 
don't have a left and a right, you don't have a middle." 
</P>
<P>
 In the modern Congress, the grand compromisers are growing increasingly 
scarce. That is why so many in Washington lamented the downfall of House Ways 
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), who had to give up his 
chairmanship when he was indicted on charges of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal-maker is becoming as extinct as the woolly mammoth in Congress," 
said Rutgers University political scientist Ross K. Baker. "It's reassuring 
that the species hasn't died out entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 In large part, Breaux says, it is growing more difficult to be flexible on 
issues because interest groups can mobilize their forces so quickly these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in the middle is more difficult than it used to be. . . . When I first 
got to Congress 22 years ago, we'd be dealing with controversial subjects and 
then maybe a week after, we'd start getting a letter or maybe a call," he said. 
"Today because of the instantaneous communications about what Congress is 
doing, the special interest groups immediately activate their constituents to 
start lobbying." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Breaux, whose political mentor is scandal-plagued Louisiana Gov. 
Edwin W. Edwards, holds anything against the special interests and their 
lobbyists. At least not those from his state. 
</P>
<P>
 This, after all, is the legislator who -- as he held out for natural gas and 
sugar subsidies during the 1981 budget battle -- issued a now-famous 
declaration that his vote could not be bought, but "it can be rented." Already 
he has begun pressuring Clinton to include tax breaks for the oil industry in 
the health care bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux also was a target of an expose by ABC-TV's "PrimeTime Live" into the 
junkets lawmakers and their staffers take at the expense of groups that lobby 
them. The program featured Breaux and other senators on a lavish trip to Boca 
Raton, Fla., that was paid for by such corporations as U.S. Tobacco Co., Texaco 
Inc. and Prudential Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 He defended it by saying he was playing in a charity tennis tournament. But 
such publicity was a driving force behind Congress' recent moves to narrow the 
kinds of gifts members may take from lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, argues political scientist Norman Ornstein, it is the coalition-builders 
such as Breaux who can best keep the special interests at bay on legislation. 
They, he says, manage to overcome "the inordinate power of groups to block 
things from happening."

 Final returns in Ukraine's presidential election showed a nation polarized 
between the pro-Russian east, which supported former Prime Minister Leonid 
Kuchma, and the more nationalist west, which supported President Leonid 
Kravchuk. The two will face a July runoff. Kravchuk had 38% of the vote in 
Sunday's balloting, while Kuchma finished second in the seven-man race with 
31%.

SOCIALISTS WILL TRY TO REJOIN JAPAN COALITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a renewed offer from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to name 
their leader as prime minister, Japan's Socialists agreed to try again today to 
rejoin the coalition of outgoing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met Hata and six other leaders of parties 
in the coalition Tuesday and said he will participate in an eleventh-hour 
attempt to patch together a new ruling alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations on policies for the coalition began this morning. If they are 
successful, a decision on whom to name as prime minister will follow, the eight 
leaders agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yohei Kono, the Liberal Democrats' president, has courted the 
Socialists fervently, Hata's coalition has adopted a studied coolness toward 
the left-leaning party whose April walkout deprived it of a majority. The 
Socialists hold a swing vote between the coalition and the Liberal Democrats, 
whose 38-year rule came to an end last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing an LDP no-confidence motion he could not defeat, Hata resigned Saturday 
after talks with the Socialists collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting with Murayama on Tuesday night, held after he agreed to make a 
final effort to reach an accord with the coalition, Kono reiterated an earlier 
offer of the premiership. The Socialist leader replied that he will contact 
Kono after negotiations with the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either way, we must make a decision by tomorrow," Murayama said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kono and Murayama agreed that the lower house should vote for a new prime 
minister today, the last day of its current session, to give Japan's new leader 
time to prepare to attend the Group of Seven economic summit and meet President 
Clinton in Naples, Italy, from July 8-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama also agreed with the seven coalition leaders to "make supreme 
efforts" to hold the vote today. Failure to reach agreement would force an 
extension of the session.

AID RUSHED TO RWANDA REFUGEES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations began feeding people in a newly discovered camp of 5,000 
refugees on the outskirts of Rwanda's capital Tuesday, and the Red Cross 
evacuated 39 seriously wounded people to its clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Jean-Guy Plante, military spokesman for the U.N. Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda, said aid workers rushed food to a camp at Ndera, on the rebel-held 
outskirts of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp was discovered Monday and "the people were in pretty bad shape, so we 
launched a quick operation to bring them food," Plante said. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of people are believed to have been displaced since Rwanda's civil 
war erupted following the death of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana in a 
suspicious plane crash April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 A French security consultant Tuesday blamed Habyarimana's death on Tutsi 
rebels. Paul Barril, former head of France's anti-terror squad, told France-2 
television that the downing of the plane was a signal for a general offensive 
by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 8,000 people remained trapped in the Sainte Famille church complex 
in the capital, denied food because of low U.N. supplies, Plante said. Many 
look as if they are starving to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Plante said the United Nations hopes to evacuate Tutsis from Sainte Famille 
today.

IN DJIBOUTI, INDEPENDENCE HAS BROUGHT LITTLE CHANGE; AFRICA: AFTER 17 YEARS, 
NATION STILL RELIES HEAVILY ON FRENCH AID. ITS ONLY EXPORTS ARE GOATS AND 
CAMELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a proud moment, one of the proudest this African outpost had known 
since being stillborn into nationhood 17 years ago. By 8 a.m., a veritable 
Who's Who of Djibouti was on hand for the ribbon-cutting ceremony that would 
open the new little airport with a single departure gate. 
</P>
<P>
 There were French military officers in their summer whites, ambassadors and 
government officials, and Siad Coubeche, who owns Djibouti's major commercial 
enterprise -- a Coca-Cola bottling plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, arriving 45 minutes late in his Cadillac limousine, flanked by 
outriders on motorcycles, was the Somali-born president himself, Hassan Gouled 
Aptidon, 78, Africa's oldest leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't forget our friends who made this possible," Gouled said last week in 
French, nodding toward three Arabs in the crowd of dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he headed into the air-conditioned, marbled-floor terminal to marvel at a 
baggage conveyor belt and a digital message board that flashed his name. Clerks 
in the duty-free shop snapped to attention as he approached. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that the one-jet national carrier, Air Djibouti, had gone belly up 
five years earlier or that only a dozen commercial flights a week -- half of 
them Air France jumbo jets from Paris -- would land here. This airport was a 
symbol of national identity and stood, along with a Sheraton Hotel, as one of 
the rare visible achievements of Djibouti's post-colonial era. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the former French Territory of Afars and Issas hasn't had much to 
cheer about since it became the last European colony in Africa to gain 
independence, on a steamy June night in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a single head of state showed up that night to watch the French tricolor 
lowered for the last night over Africa; of the Djibouti males in attendance, 
most sat quiet and glassy-eyed, chewing qat, a narcotic weed imported from 
Ethiopia to which almost all men here are addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks before independence, Gouled, a former camel herder with a 
sixth-grade education, was asked by a visiting journalist how a country that 
imported almost all of its food, produced nothing except Coca-Cola and ice and 
counted among its 320,000 citizens three university graduates and no doctors 
could hope to survive economically. 
</P>
<P>
 He replied, "We have many possibilities -- salt, tourism, atomic energy, maybe 
a duty-free port like Hong Kong." He took a puff on his French cigarette and 
paused for emphasis -- "And French aid." 
</P>
<P>
 No one would argue his last point. Probably no African nation today remains 
more dependent on its former colonial master. French aid and business account 
for 60% of Djibouti's gross national product, and were it not for the presence 
of 10,000 French nationals and soldiers, diplomats say, this empty, 
Vermont-sized wasteland might simply disintegrate as a country and be left for 
Somalia or Ethiopia to swallow up. 
</P>
<P>
 Djibouti (meaning "my casserole" in the Afar language) has but three national 
assets: an excellent Red Sea port, which served as a backup staging area during 
the Persian Gulf War; a broken-down railway to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, operating 
at 5% capacity, and now, the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Its only exports are goats and camels -- which are transported on the hoof to 
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Its imports include almost everything it 
needs, from drinking water to butter, meat and matchsticks. 
</P>
<P>
 As if Djibouti's journey into independence weren't perilous enough, civil war 
struck the country in 1991 when the minority Afars of the north took up arms 
against Gouled's Somali-speaking Issa tribe. The tiny Djibouti army fell apart 
and its commander in chief was suspended on corruption charges. Within weeks 
the Afar-based Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD) 
controlled two-thirds of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 France keeps 4,000 troops and legionnaires here -- its largest military 
presence in Africa -- but refused to intervene in the fighting. Left to his own 
devices, Gouled built up a 15,000-man army, largely made up of Issas recruited 
from Somalia and Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
 By September, the Afars had been driven into the volcanic mountains of the 
north and across the border into Ethiopia. The war for now, at least, has 
sputtered to an end with the Afars the apparent losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although FRUD boycotted the May, 1993, multi-party election that Gouled won 
handily, the government hopes to get peace talks under way with the rebels, 
perhaps this summer, and has announced plans to demobilize its army. In 
response to French urgings, Gouled has allowed an increasing degree of 
political debate. 
</P>
<P>
 France, which colonized Djibouti in 1862 as a fueling stop for its Saigon- and 
Madagascar-bound ships, has left an imprint on this run-down capital that is as 
evident today as it was a century ago; from an Air France cargo flight each 
Wednesday comes such an abundance of fine foods and luxury goods that a visitor 
might wonder if he were in Paris instead of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 In Place Menelik, Djibouti's dingy square, among cafes and bars nestled under 
urine-drenched arches, little stores, some with French shopkeepers, offer the 
latest fashions, finest jewelry and freshest vegetables from France. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cafe de Paris, the recent menu included sea trout in leek sauce, endive 
and walnut salad, and sea bream with cucumbers and pink peppers, complemented 
by a wide selection of wines and cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, on Rue de Paris and Rue de Marseille, children hawked postcards and 
chewing gum and handless beggars thrust their stumps in pedestrians' faces. 
</P>
<P>
 The stifling heat of day had diminished with the dusk when a group of French 
legionnaires headed into the Blue Note and ordered Stella Artois beers. It 
could have been 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Djibouti, though shabbier and dirtier, seemed largely unchanged by its journey 
into statehood.

HAITIAN PREMIER OPPOSES U.S. INVASION; CARIBBEAN: ROBERT MALVAL REJECTS ANY 
MILITARY ACTION, WHICH MANY BELIEVE IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Malval, the acting prime minister and a major supporter of U.S. policy 
in this Caribbean nation, said Tuesday that he opposes "as a matter of 
principle" any U.S. military intervention here. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with three reporters, Malval became the second leading Haitian 
figure in the past week to publicly reject U.S. military action, a step that 
many involved in Haitian affairs think is the only realistic solution to the 
country's ongoing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in an interview with National Public 
Radio on Saturday, said the Haitian constitution prohibits him from supporting 
direct, outside interference -- such as U.S. military action -- even if it 
meant his return to power. He said that he could be impeached if he accepted 
such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But asked the question again Tuesday at the National Press Club in Washington, 
Aristide -- who has made conflicting statements on the issue in recent weeks -- 
refused to give a clear answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Malval said that Aristide, who appointed him prime minister in September, was 
using an "opportunistic" legalism in Saturday comments to avoid taking a 
controversial position. "Aristide should stop this talk of impeachment," Malval 
said. "The fear of impeachment is silly. . . . You are either opposed on 
principle, and I am opposed on principle . . . or go with" the intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he spoke of his principled opposition, Malval said there were 
practical reasons to doubt the wisdom of a military invasion, noting, "It might 
solve things in the short run, but in the mid- and long terms, it would only 
create more problems." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he feared that U.S. military involvement would be so costly to 
the United States that it would endanger the billions of dollars in U.S. 
financial aid necessary to restore Haiti's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide was driven into exile by a bloody military revolt Sept. 30, 1991. 
Malval, who was one of the few members of the Haitian elite to back Aristide, 
was named prime minister as part of negotiations with the army to restore 
democracy. But the two men had a falling-out in December after an agreement 
with the army was negated by the armed forces and Aristide rejected Malval's 
effort to renegotiate a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Malval, at the strong urging of the United States, has agreed to stay on 
indefinitely as acting prime minister to preserve at least the appearance that 
Haiti has a legitimate government; its presence denies the military and its 
civilian puppet regime grounds for seeking recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 But Malval said Tuesday that if the crisis is not resolved by September, "I 
will walk out on this." 
</P>
<P>
 He showed clearly during the interview that he was bitter and frustrated by 
his largely symbolic role, which has led the military to brand him a virtual 
traitor and has essentially made him a prisoner in his own home. 
</P>
<P>
 Malval said that if the crisis is not resolved by September, the nation will 
not be able to survive economically no matter who is in power. 
</P>
<P>
 While saying the United States "has done more than was expected" to resolve 
the crisis and that the stringent sanctions have finally shown the military 
that the Americans are serious, Malval expressed doubts that the army will give 
in.

AMERICANS OF VOTING AGE TO HIT 193 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This fall's elections will see 7.8 million more U.S. residents of voting age 
than in the last midterm contests in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Census Bureau estimates that 193,650,000 U.S. residents will be 18 or 
older this November, 4.1 million more than in 1992 and 7.8 million more than in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone who is old enough to vote does so. Some are not eligible because 
they are not U.S. citizens or are convicted felons. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, 33.1% of those who were eligible voted. And in 1992, when a 
presidential contest heightened public interest, turnout was 50.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 While the number of Americans old enough to cast ballots is growing, the 
typical voter is changing. 
</P>
<P>
 The declining birth rates of the late 1960s and 1970s mean that fewer people 
are turning 18 than when the large baby boom groups were reaching voting age. 
That means older people will make up an ever larger share of the voting-age 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Women will comprise 52% of the voting-age population. They will outnumber men 
in every state except Alaska, Hawaii and Nevada.

KEY HOUSE PANEL ABANDONS EFFORT TO WRITE HEALTH BILL; CONGRESS: THE ENERGY AND 
COMMERCE COMMITTEE HAD BEEN SEEN AS A HOPE FOR COMPROMISE. OTHER PROPOSALS ARE 
LIKELY TO BE TOO LIBERAL TO PASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The committee that many had considered the most important health reform 
testing ground in the House gave up its months-long effort to produce a bill, 
saying Tuesday that its membership appeared hopelessly at odds. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other single development, this one captured how difficult it has 
become to find a middle ground among the left, right and myriad special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the Energy and Commerce Committee had been regarded as the most 
fertile ground in the House for a grand health compromise. Of the three House 
committees charged with producing sweeping legislation, its largely moderate 
membership most closely resembled the House's overall ideological bent. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's failure to produce legislation puts enormous pressure on House 
Democratic leaders to come up with a bill virtually from scratch, because the 
legislation being produced by the other two House panels is likely to be too 
liberal to win approval by the House as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), which conceded what 
has been obvious for some time, Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it would be counterproductive to convene the committee, call 
up legislation and consume an enormous amount of time and resources without any 
assurance of success. A prolonged debate in the Energy and Commerce Committee 
could undercut or delay the efforts of other committees to bring sound 
legislation to the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House sought to put the best face on the development, with 
spokeswoman Lorrie McHugh saying that Dingell's move demonstrated his 
commitment to "keeping the process moving forward by focusing on the process on 
the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dingell 
had come "very, very close" to getting the votes to report out a bill 
resembling the President's proposal. "He could have kept working on it but, 
because time was running out, he wanted to focus on action on the House floor," 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Steelman, a Republican analyst and health care lobbyist, agreed: "His 
role has not been diminished by virtue of what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dingell, whose legislative skills are renowned on Capitol Hill, it was 
also an enormously personal defeat, despite the fact that he and several 
members of his committee will continue to play a major role in the health 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell's father introduced the first national health insurance bill in 
Congress more than half a century ago, and the younger Dingell vividly recalls 
John D. Dingell Sr. being branded a communist and worse for his advocacy of a 
plan that would guarantee health coverage to every American. 
</P>
<P>
 Since succeeding his father in the House upon Dingell Sr.'s death in 1955, 
Dingell has introduced health legislation modeled on his father's bill on the 
first day of every Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted in his letter that he had tried a number of approaches to compromise: 
lightening President Clinton's proposed requirements that employers pay the 
lion's share of their workers' health costs; reducing the proposed benefits 
that would be guaranteed to every American; giving less regulatory power to the 
new government entities the Clinton plan envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "These and other proposals brought us very close to assembling the votes 
needed to report a bill," Dingell wrote. "Unfortunately, neither our proposals 
nor any other suggested legislation enjoys the support of a majority of 
committee members." 
</P>
<P>
 With no GOP support, Dingell needed 23 of the panel's 27 Democrats to pass a 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the panel's health 
subcommittee, said the effort underscored the difficulty that House Democratic 
leaders face in an intensely partisan environment where they can count on no 
Republican votes. In the House as a whole, that means they can afford to lose 
no more than 39 of the votes of the 256 Democrats and one independent. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've seen in our committee is the problem that the leadership is going 
to have when they get to the House floor," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dingell's concession was not unexpected, Bruce Fried, an independent 
health analyst, said that it, nevertheless, does not bode well for the Clinton 
Administration when a major bill reaches the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems that Dingell has experienced will re-emerge in the House," said 
Lynn Etheredge, a former health policy analyst in the Office of Management and 
Budget during the Jimmy Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sends a cautionary note," Etheredge said. "It indicates that it may not 
be clear sailing ahead just because two other committees (one in the Senate, 
one in the House) have produced bills." 
</P>
<P>
 The House Education and Labor Committee has produced a bill, but it is 
significantly more generous than Clinton's in the benefits that it would offer 
Americans. "That bill's a joke," one senior Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the House Ways and Means Committee is expected to wrap up its work 
this week. However, its bill is expected to include a requirement similar to 
Clinton's that firms pay 80% of their workers' health care costs. All sides 
believe that the so-called employer mandate will have to be modified 
significantly, if not scrapped, to survive a vote by the full House. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the Senate, the Finance Committee -- whose deliberations have 
been the most closely watched in Congress -- prepared to begin today its formal 
public effort to produce a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said he plans to offer a 
modified version of the mandate, which would take effect only if other measures 
to expand coverage on a voluntary basis did not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it appeared that the committee probably would not even agree to the 
mandate as a fall-back measure, leaving open the question of whether it can 
meet Clinton's bottom-line goal of assuring coverage for everyone. The 
President has threatened to veto any bill that does not include universal 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan wants to tax each pack of cigarettes $2 and impose a 1% payroll tax 
on large companies to help pay for health insurance for all Americans. The 
mandate in his plan would require all employers to buy insurance for their 
workers if voluntary measures fail within a few years to cover most of the 39 
million now uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also features a 1.75% tax on health insurance premiums to help pay 
for academic health centers. This assessment would be paid by the insurance 
company or health plan that issued the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, in a speech to the Economic Club of Washington, First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton predicted that, if Congress does not pass a health 
reform bill this year, public pressure will build for a single-payer system, 
where the government will pay for all health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a grass-roots movement that sweeps this country that will 
achieve a single-payer system," she said, possibly around the year 2000.

POSTAL OFFICIALS ADMIT DELIVERY IS GETTING WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mail delivery has worsened in virtually every section of the country instead 
of rebounding as expected after a dismal performance last winter, postal 
officials acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest quarterly mail service statistics, obtained by the trade 
publication Business Mailers Review, mean more trouble for Postmaster General 
Marvin T. Runyon Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon finishes his second year in office this week and had hoped for a 95% 
on-time mail delivery rate after reorganizing the Postal Service. But with new 
spring quarter figures -- confirmed by postal officials -- showing that just 
82% of letters addressed to overnight delivery zones arrive on time, Runyon's 
anniversary is marked by a growing number of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's deficit may hit $2.1 billion this year, agency officials said, 
more than 50% higher than the $1.3 billion deficit Runyon originally projected. 
And the Merit Systems Protection Board declared last week that Runyon's 1992 
restructuring of the Postal Service violated reduction-in-force rules, a 
decision that could force him to reinstate hundreds of displaced managers. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the Postal Service's own board of governors have said that all 
of those problems pale by comparison to mail service. As Board Chairman J. Sam 
Winters put it: Without good service, "our competitors will beat us up." 
</P>
<P>
 The new numbers, which postal officials plan to announce in mid-July, indicate 
that 82% of the letters that should have been delivered overnight were 
delivered on time, a drop from 84% in the same period of 1993. On-time 
deliveries of two-day letters -- those traveling up to 600 miles -- fell 
sharply, dropping to 71% from 78%, and punctual handling of three-day mail fell 
to 77% from 80%. "Service is not as good as we want, and we're determined to 
make improvements," said Sandra Harding, a postal spokeswoman. She pointed to 
Runyon's recent decision to eliminate an entire level of regional mail managers 
and replace them with 10 new area vice presidents. "This is the main reason we 
fine-tuned the management structure: to improve."

CONGRESS TO SEEK LEGISLATION FOR CIA-FBI COOPERATION; ESPIONAGE: INTELLIGENCE 
PANEL CONCLUDES A PRESIDENTIAL ORDER REQUIRING THE AGENCIES TO JOINTLY 
INVESTIGATE COUNTERSPIES ISN'T WORKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about continuing lapses of the kind that permitted the most damaging 
counterspy ever to operate at the CIA, congressional intelligence committees 
have decided to push for legislation requiring the agency to cooperate with the 
FBI in investigating counterspies, according to congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The committees have concluded that a May 3 presidential directive has not 
succeeded in closing the gaps in CIA-FBI cooperation that became apparent with 
the arrest this year and subsequent guilty plea of Aldrich H. Ames, the sources 
said. Ames, a 31-year CIA veteran, sold the former Soviet Union and later 
Russia some of his agency's most sensitive secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the CIA failed to advise the FBI for two years that Ames 
initially had given suspicious responses in a 1991 polygraph examination, even 
though the FBI had joined in hunting for a suspected mole, Senate Intelligence 
Committee Chairman Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) has noted. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the rising concern, the intelligence panel has passed 
legislation, in the form of an amendment to the 1995 budget authorization, that 
would make the FBI director responsible for counterintelligence and would 
mandate CIA cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 That language goes considerably beyond Clinton's directive, which strengthened 
the National Security Council's authority over counterintelligence, designated 
a senior FBI official to head a key counterespionage group at the CIA and 
directed CIA officials to work at the FBI. Clinton's order also created new 
policy and operations boards to coordinate and oversee the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's directive marked the 11th presidential attempt over the last two 
decades to achieve interagency cooperation on counterintelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one of them has worked," said a congressional source familiar with the 
issue. "Now we're on the 11th and still the FBI doesn't get full cooperation. 
So, instead of a healing process, there's more bad blood." 
</P>
<P>
 The source declined to provide examples of failures to cooperate but said the 
CIA has raised the issue by citing its need to protect its "sources and 
methods." 
</P>
<P>
 But another source familiar with the dispute said the concerns arise primarily 
because CIA Director R. James Woolsey has indicated at the agency that he does 
not have confidence in the arrangement spelled out by the directive. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Woolsey and FBI Director Louis J. Freeh testified before the 
Senate Intelligence Committee in support of the presidential directive. But 
sources said Freeh since has agreed with senior committee officials that only 
legislation can solve the problem permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Bucknam, Freeh's chief of staff, declined to comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey argued in his testimony that giving the FBI overall 
counterintelligence responsibility would bring back the rivalries that once 
existed between the FBI and CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the National Counterintelligence Center at the CIA, created by 
Clinton's directive, Woolsey said: "I can't conceive of a substantive issue 
being raised -- whether a polygraph (result), a foreign intelligence agent's 
report . . . that does not come to the Center." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 24, Freeh named Edward J. Curran to serve as chief of the 
counterespionage group at the CIA center. Curran was formerly assistant special 
agent in charge of counterintelligence at the FBI's Los Angeles field office. 
</P>
<P>
 The counterintelligence bill won committee approval by a vote of 16 to 1 after 
a last-ditch effort to alter it failed. The committee voted down an amendment, 
suggested by the White House, that would have given the CIA director the 
authority to circumvent the FBI by telling the President that CIA information 
could not be shared with the bureau. The committee concluded that there are no 
circumstances under which the FBI could not be told about counterspies and 
counterespionage. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources contended that the CIA has not undertaken the kind of 
internal reforms that might improve counterintelligence work. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior CIA official countered that some of the ideas put forward recently 
are in fact old ideas or "bad ideas whose time has come again." 
</P>
<P>
 But several sources said they were disappointed by the lack of reforms at the 
CIA since Woolsey took over last year. Former CIA Director Robert M. Gates had 
begun an overhaul of the U.S. intelligence community. Woolsey said during his 
confirmation hearings he would continue those changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey has focused primarily on streamlining the intelligence budget and 
personnel under pressure of budget cutbacks, while trying to ensure that the 
United States does not lose its competitive edge, a senior CIA official said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a congressional intelligence source said that "there's no game plan. 
People are holding on to their turf and jurisdictions and Woolsey has not come 
forth as a leader to say the Ames case is a perfect example of what's wrong 
with this community. He hasn't said this is how to restructure and alter 
mission. Some changes are going on, but not enough."

MOST FEDERAL CRIME DEBT UNCOLLECTED, GAO SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Uncollected debts of people convicted of federal crimes have risen more than 
tenfold during the past decade to $4 billion, with only pennies out of every 
dollar owed ever obtained, government investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Accounting Office said the swelling of uncollected debt resulted 
from the savings-and-loan financial scandals of the 1980s and from the 
government's poor record in monitoring and collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Fine Center, created by Congress in 1987 to oversee collection 
efforts, will not be operational until 1996 and in its first phase will not be 
automated, said the GAO, an investigative wing of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have an archaic, decentralized, non-system which allows many 
criminal offenders to escape paying what they owe their victims and the federal 
government," Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) said at a hearing of the Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said uncollected debts rose from $300 million in 1985 to the 
approximately $4-billion figure today. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the latter amount is in fines and restitution orders imposed in 
major financial institution fraud cases between 1988 and the present. Only $49 
million has been collected. Of the 50 largest criminal debts, totaling $609 
million, only $4 million has been paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Wray, GAO director for justice issues, testified that an "inevitable 
gap" separates amounts owed and collected because federal courts tend to base 
restitution orders in major financial fraud cases on victim losses rather than 
the offender's ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ames of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts told the panel 
that his office was committed to having the National Fine Center running in all 
94 jurisdictions nationwide by Sept. 1, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the program is more than a year behind schedule because 
"this project has been much larger, more complex and much more difficult to 
implement than originally expected."

 If Shannon Faulkner wants to be the first woman to march with The Citadel's 
all-male corps of cadets she should have to look like one, crew cut and all, 
the college told a judge. Her lawyers, however, said the requirement would be 
punitive and inconsistent with the way the military treats women. The 
state-supported military school in South Carolina originally accepted Faulkner 
but changed its mind when it discovered that she is a woman. U.S. District 
Judge C. Weston Houck will rule next month on her admittance.

TV EXECUTIVES SAY CHILDREN TUNE OUT SHOWS THAT TEACH; MEDIA: BROADCASTERS ARGUE 
AGAINST FCC RULES SEEKING MORE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING. THEY SAY LITTLE VIEWERS 
PREFER 'JETSONS' TO INSTRUCTIONAL SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Television broadcasters, decrying proposed Federal Communications Commission 
rules barring use of "The Jetsons" cartoons and similar shows as educational 
programming for children, defended their practices Tuesday by saying that young 
viewers are bored by most instructional programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying at a packed agency hearing, television executives said that 
educational shows such as PBS' "Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?" and 
"Ghostwriter," which win accolades from children's advocates, cost as much as 
$390,000 per 30-minute episode -- more than many non-educational programs -- 
and survive only because they are shown on public television networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators who favor the new rules, however, challenged the television industry 
to develop shows that teach and entertain, such as the two PBS shows. Those 
programs have low ratings compared to animated action shows, many of which have 
advertiser tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 The educators also said shows such as "The Jetsons" and "Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers," a widely popular martial arts show, should not be considered 
educational because they have no instructional content. While television 
broadcasters did not contest that point, they argued that the FCC should not 
react by issuing further restrictions on their independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Television programmers have come under increasing scrutiny as the FCC 
considers tightening the definition of educational programming. Broadcasters 
have to detail how they are complying with the Children's Television Act of 
1990, which encourages them to air more instructional fare, when they apply for 
license renewals every five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives and television programmers told the FCC that they are 
complying with the law and that stricter regulation of the industry would 
stifle creativity. FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, in an interview after the 
hearing, said that educators, the television industry and the FCC all agree 
that "broadcasters have a social contract with the public" to provide quality 
instructional programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Under existing FCC rules, any show that advances "the positive development of 
the child in any respect" qualifies as educational programming. The regulations 
neither instruct broadcasters when to schedule their educational shows nor set 
out how much air time such programming deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the FCC is considering refining the definition of "educational." Under a 
proposed new standard, a show could be listed as instructional only if its 
"primary purpose" is educational. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC is also examining plans to require stations to broadcast at least one 
hour of educational shows between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. and to hire independent 
education experts to evaluate shows that stations plan to broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 study by the Center for Media Education, a Washington watchdog group, 
found that some stations, when applying for license renewal, listed shows 
including "The Jetsons," a 1960s cartoon about a family of the future, and 
"Super Mario Brothers," a cartoon based on the Nintendo video game, as 
instructional. Other stations air educational programs before 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth D. Werner, senior vice president of business affairs for Walt Disney 
Television, urged the FCC to consider a looser definition of "educational," 
asserting that children will not watch programs "that are anything short of 
fully entertaining and engaging." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a program is lacking in entertainment value, not enough children will 
watch to attract the advertising revenue necessary for commercial survival," 
said Jeanette B. Trias, president of ABC/Capital Cities children's 
entertainment unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's advocates said broadcasters are capable of developing programs that 
both educate and entertain, but are unlikely to create such shows without more 
federal regulation.

To make more room for violent criminals in Florida's crowded prisons, 
nonviolent prisoners who entered the United States illegally will have their 
sentences commuted if they agree to be deported. Immigration officials said 113 
prisoners from 16 countries have agreed. Many were serving time for drug 
crimes.

DOMESTIC ABUSE SHELTERS WILL GET $6.1 MILLION; VIOLENCE: SPURRED BY SIMPSON 
CASE, L.A. AND COUNTY OFFICIALS ADDRESS LACK OF SPACE FOR THOSE SEEKING REFUGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurred to action by the intense publicity surrounding the O.J. Simpson case, 
Los Angeles city and county governments created panels Tuesday to grapple with 
the problem of domestic violence and agreed to spend $6.1 million on shelters 
for abuse victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging a significant shortage of shelters for domestic violence 
victims, the City Council agreed to spend $5 million a year to develop such 
havens and the County Board of Supervisors approved spending $1.1 million on 
the 18 shelters already scattered throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make clear to the community that we take the issue of domestic 
violence seriously," said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who proposed the city 
measures. "This household terrorism is wicked and horrifying -- and sadly all 
too common." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have been working in the field of domestic violence welcomed the 
official attention but said they hoped the commitment would not fade when the 
Simpson case disappeared from the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time," said Patti Giggins, executive director of the Los Angeles 
Commission on Assaults Against Women, which runs a 24-hour rape and battery hot 
line. "They've been cutting us back and now they're going to spend money. 
Sometimes it takes a big case like this to shake people up." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Bruce, president of the local chapter of the National Organization for 
Women, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost human nature to notice things when there is a crisis," she said. 
During the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, 
"There was a focus on sexual harassment that is still around. If this is what 
it takes, that's fine, but we need to look at issues seriously even if they're 
not on the news every night." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of domestic violence jumped to the top of the national agenda after 
Simpson was arrested in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend 
Ronald Lyle Goldman earlier this month. The investigation has spotlighted 
Simpson's stormy relationship with his ex-wife. He pleaded no contest in 1989 
to misdemeanor spousal battery. Also, officials last week released a tape of a 
911 telephone call that Nicole Simpson made in October. She could be heard 
pleading for help, saying that Simpson had broken into her house and was 
angrily shouting at her. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's new Domestic Violence Task Force, designed to coordinate the city's 
response to the problem, will include victim advocates, police officers and 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The county plans an additional group that will draw members from numerous 
agencies, including the district attorney's office, the Sheriff's Department, 
Children's Services and the Los Angeles city attorney's office. The panel will 
review arrest procedures, prosecution of offenders, support and protection of 
victims, public education and early intervention among adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragic events of the past 10 days surrounding O.J Simpson . . . have 
become an unfortunate catalyst for a heightened level of public awareness 
regarding domestic violence and spousal abuse in this country," said Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who proposed the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 During the City Council's discussion, members referred to "recent events" but 
avoided specific mention of the murder charges filed against the former Buffalo 
Bills running back. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also intends to use its cable television station to publicize 
domestic violence hot lines and to work with the Los Angeles Housing Authority 
to grant battered women priority status in applying for permanent subsidized 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city will seek to make domestic violence a part of its 
community-based policing strategy by including experts in the field of domestic 
violence on the Community Police Advisory Boards being set up by the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Simpson's arrest, the Los Angeles Police Department had attempted 
to deal more aggressively with the problem. In recent months, the department 
set up a special unit in each of its 18 police stations and it has specially 
trained more than 100 detectives in how to handle such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our big push in the city has been focused on the law enforcement end," said 
Councilwoman Laura Chick, a former social worker. "We have to do catch-up to 
look at the problem in its entirety and go after all of the pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledged that the additional expenditures on shelters were 
minuscule compared with the scope of the problem. Last year alone, there were 
67,732 domestic violence calls to law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles 
County, resulting in 16,663 arrests, according to state statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only three domestic violence shelters within the city and 18 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny percentage of battered spouses contact shelters, officials said, and 
most of those who do are turned away because of a lack of space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors, meanwhile, allocated $65,000 to the 18 shelters 
throughout the county. The grants come from a domestic violence trust fund 
financed through a surcharge on marriage license fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The county authorized use of the funds in April, before the Simpson case. The 
board asked shelters to apply for the funds, and on Tuesday approved the 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing studies that report an alarming increase in violence among teens, 
Commission for Women Vice President Olivia Rodriguez told the board that the 
county must also focus on stemming violent impulses among youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear story after story of boys slapping girls and the girls seem to think 
they asked for it," Rodriguez said. "There has to be more education done, 
getting them to know that violence is not the way to go. This is something that 
all of these agencies and the school system have got to get together to do." 
Domestic Violence 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council and the Los Angeles County supervisors have 
established special task forces to address the problem of domestic violence. 
Emergency calls to police agencies and arrests for spousal abuse have increased 
overall in the past five years, though the numbers decreased in Los Angeles 
County in 1993. The number of homicides has varied over the years in the county 
but decreased statewide.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GUN BILL GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate has passed, on 22-12 vote, and sent to the Assembly a bill that 
would require gun owners in certain domestic violence cases to relinquish their 
firearms, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) would extend the current 
prohibition against buying a gun for the duration of a domestic violence 
restraining order to firearms already in possession of the person named in the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said that under existing law people who are subject to protective orders 
issued in domestic violence cases cannot buy or receive firearms while the 
orders are in effect. However, the restriction does not apply to guns already 
in possession of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would empower a court to apply the restriction to firearms owned by 
the individual if the judge found that further violent acts involving guns were 
likely. The guns could be ordered to be relinquished for the duration of the 
restraining order.

GONE CAR CRAZY; FOR CHINA, THE DAWNING OF THE AUTOMOTIVE AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They came by bicycle and on foot, in rickety overcrowded buses and in boxy 
yellow taxi vans that Beijingers call miandi , or "bread loaves." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a privileged few came by private car to China's International Automotive 
Industry Exhibition that ends here today after breaking records for attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors said the event's popularity reflects China's new burning passion for 
the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 The love affair with the car is all the more remarkable because only a handful 
of Chinese own one. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 1% of the 500,000 passenger cars sold in China last year went to private 
buyers. In keeping with the Chinese socialist system, most were purchased by 
state-owned companies or work units -- although many cynics point out that 
government officials often regard the publicly purchased cars as their personal 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 But after several years of rapid economic growth, the once-impossible dream of 
owning a car has inched closer to reality for many Chinese, particularly in the 
major cities and affluent coastal area. The government optimistically predicts 
that China will produce more than 3 million vehicles by the turn of the century 
and that many will end up in private hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is different this year," said Hans-Jorg Geduhn, who is chief Beijing 
representative for the German automobile company BMW, "is that the Chinese 
customer is more and more recognizing that a car is not a dream anymore. It is 
no longer a goal that he will never reach. Everyone is making their own 
calculation about how long it will take before they have a car." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, such as 30-year-old Zheng Jianguo, the dream has been realized. 
</P>
<P>
 Since buying his first car, a tiny Chinese-made compact, in 1989, Zheng has 
purchased a succession of six cars, each one more expensive than the last. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Beijing auto show Tuesday, surrounded by three bulky assistants who 
huddled around him protectively as he spoke on a cellular phone, Zheng was 
sizing up the Porsche display. 
</P>
<P>
 Zheng, who said he makes about $120,000 a year in the imported-auto repair 
business he founded eight years ago, is thinking about buying his seventh car. 
But he was skeptical about any immediate development of a private car market on 
a mass scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who belong to government work units cannot afford to buy cars," he 
said. "Even if they had the money, the first thing they would do is buy an 
apartment. But who knows, more and more people are becoming businessmen like 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the distant possibility of someday owning a car has unleashed a car 
passion here that rivals mass political movements of the not-so-distant past. 
</P>
<P>
 Car posters are a favorite teen-age wall hanging. Driving lessons have become 
a rage even in carless families. Car fan magazines, including one whose title 
translates as Car Fan, have proliferated. Thousands of car aficionados, many of 
whom have never ridden in a private vehicle, poured into the exhibition center 
beginning last Friday to gawk at the best from the rest of the world, including 
all three major American companies and first-time exhibitors from the new 
automotive power, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 397 foreign automotive and parts firms and more than 500 Chinese 
companies exhibited at the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants ranged from the giant China First Automobile Group, maker of the 
famous Red Flag limousine favored by Chairman Mao, to Kingsmart Ltd., a Hong 
Kong firm that specializes in 24-karat gold-plated grills and hood ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 American and Japanese manufacturers staffed their exhibits with provocatively 
dressed professional models and, in the case of Nissan, even held fashion shows 
to attract visitors. Chinese exhibitors were more demure, preferring polyester 
pantsuits and models recruited from the ranks of factory workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign companies said they were there to establish a presence for the day 
when the China auto market takes off.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a show that is not going to result in any immediate sales," one 
American exhibitor said. "China's market is not yet at that point. But China is 
a huge potential market, and no one can afford not to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 When the six-day show ends today, sponsors expect more than 340,000 people 
will have attended. China has been holding annual auto shows since 1985, but 
attendance this year was more than double that of the 1993 show in Shanghai 
(153,000) and the 1992 show in Beijing (163,000). 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, confided Perry Tang, assistant manager of the Hong Kong 
marketing firm that staged the show, representatives of the Italian firm Fiat 
became worried that its large display might collapse under the surge of people 
on the supporting elevated platform. 
</P>
<P>
 At the General Motors exhibit, which featured a Cadillac stretch limousine and 
long-legged Chinese models wearing miniskirts tied at the waist with American 
flags, a woman narrowly avoided being pushed over a protective railing by a 
frenzied group seeking pamphlets on the GM line of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush to collect the leaflets, which are often simply lists of technical 
details, is part of a new hobby among young Chinese to memorize and recite 
facts about different vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Explained one high school student who spent his first day of summer vacation 
at the show with two classmates, each of whom carried plastic bags bulging with 
materials: 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to be able to recognize every car on the street, whether it is a 
Ford or an Audi or something else."

NME TO SETTLE FRAUD CASE BY PAYING RECORD $362-MILLION FINE; HEALTH CARE: THE 
ACCORD IS NOT EXPECTED TO PUT A SERIOUS FINANCIAL STRAIN ON THE SANTA 
MONICA-BASED HOSPITAL COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 National Medical Enterprises will plead guilty to government charges of 
Medicare fraud and conspiracy and pay a fine of $362.7 million to settle a 
sweeping federal investigation, company officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of the settlement, expected to be formally announced Thursday, 
surpasses any previous fine in a U.S. fraud case involving the health care or 
defense industries. The Justice and Health and Human Services departments have 
given high priority to the case, which the Clinton Administration is expected 
to cite as an example of its commitment to combatting health care fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement allows the Santa Monica-based hospital company to put behind it 
a major public relations problem and move forward in its strategy of focusing 
on its profitable business of operating general-purpose hospitals. The accord 
is not expected to pose serious financial problems for the company, which had 
already set aside a reserve fund of $375 million to cover expected settlement 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement will signify that NME is taking full responsibility for past 
conduct in certain of its businesses," said Jeffrey C. Barbakow, brought in 
last year as president and chief executive to clean up the company's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, NME'S psychiatric hospital subsidiary will plead guilty 
to six counts of paying illegal kickbacks to gain referrals of Medicare 
patients and one count of conspiracy to make such payments. The company said it 
also has agreed to pay an additional $16.3 million to resolve potential claims 
in 28 states, including California, in which it operated psychiatric hospitals. 
The company said it expects to reach a final agreement with state authorities 
within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the company said it will plead guilty to one count of illegal payments 
and pay a $1-million fine to settle a case involving a general acute-care 
hospital in New Orleans.  
</P>
<P>
 NME also said it has reached a preliminary agreement with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission to stave off a pending action involving how the company 
accounted for psychiatric hospital revenue derived from activities included in 
the federal settlement. The company said it will pay no additional fine, but 
would consent to a civil order requiring it to adhere to federal securities 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The government settlement allows the company to continue participating in 
Medicare and other federal health care programs. It was not expected that the 
government would punish NME by barring it from the Medicare program because 
such a step could have driven the company into insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, general hospitals rely on Medicare patients for a sizable portion 
of their revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 While the settlement does disclose illegal activities at the New Orleans 
general hospital, it supports NME's contention that the federal investigation 
largely focused on problems in its psychiatric business. As part of efforts to 
repair its image, the company is selling most of its psychiatric hospitals to 
Georgia-based Charter Medical Corp. The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday 
cleared Charter's purchase of 30 of the 47 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement comes after nine months of discussions that followed a raid last 
year by hundreds of federal agents of NME facilities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement -- still subject to approval by a federal judge -- would 
resolve all civil and criminal investigations of the Santa Monica-based 
hospital chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement leaves open the possibility of criminal prosecution of current 
and former NME employees and doctors affiliated with the hospital operator. 
</P>
<P>
 In an indication of the government's interest in pursuing actions against 
individuals, a former regional vice president of NME's psychiatric hospital 
business pleaded guilty Monday in a Dallas federal court of paying at least $20 
million in bribes to gain patient referrals to NME facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Alexis, former "administrator of the year" for NME's psychiatric 
division, has agreed to become a government witness. 
</P>
<P>
 NME stock rose 50 cents per share to close at $15.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

HOT UNDER THE COLLAR? TRY WALKING AROUND IN A MOUSE SUIT; AT SOME JOBS, MISERY 
RISES WITH THE MERCURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So you think it's hot? 
</P>
<P>
 Just be glad you don't have to stand on a hot tar roof, lifting heavy 
materials dozens of feet above the ground with absolutely no shade in sight.  
</P>
<P>
 In an informal survey of the "hottest" jobs in the sweltering summer heat, 
roofers topped the list, followed by other construction workers, dry-cleaning 
employees -- and Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roofers are closer to the sun," said Dennis Chan, an emergency room physician 
at County USC Medical Center who regularly treats patients for heatstroke. 
"They're usually working with dark materials that absorb a lot of heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it takes time and effort to get on and off the roof, "they tend to sit 
up there for a long time instead of taking frequent breaks," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no official list of jobs that are particularly brutal in the 
summer heat, there are identifiable risk factors, said Carol Peterson, a 
medical epidemiologist with the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. 
They include working in closed spaces with poor ventilation and no air 
conditioning and performing a fair amount of physical activity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local government employees -- including firefighters and highway 
workers -- reported the most instances of on-the-job heat-related injuries in 
1991, the latest year for which statistics are available, said John Duncan, a 
spokesman for the California Department of Industrial Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Government employees accounted for nearly a third of the reported injuries, 
followed by construction workers at 19%, farm workers at 13% and service 
industry workers at 13%, Duncan said. Service industry workers include people 
working at theme parks, fast-food restaurants and gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction workers such as roofers are prone to bouts of heat exhaustion and 
heatstroke, which cause high temperatures, nausea, dizziness, headaches, muscle 
cramps and seizures, said Christine Hayne, director of the emergency department 
at Queen of Angels Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually anyone who works outside can get it," said Catherine Montagna, a 
spokeswoman for California Medical Center in Los Angeles. "That includes road 
construction workers, linemen for the telephone or electric company, field 
laborers and police and firemen." 
</P>
<P>
 And Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who wears a costume -- like Disneyland characters -- classically loses 
five pounds of water or more in one shift," said Fred Dennis, a physician in 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's emergency room. "When you're in a closed costume, 
you lose your ability to sweat or lose heat by sweating, and that's when your 
temperature starts to go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey and his buddies take frequent breaks and greet visitors in the shade or 
in air-conditioned rooms, Disneyland spokesman Jim McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no escape from the heat at Bowers & Sons Cleaners in Los Angeles, 
where workers operate pressing machines for six hours a day in a back room 
without air conditioning, employee Nick Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be over 100 degrees in there," Carter said. "We've got three fans 
going and we keep the doors open. I don't think air conditioning would make any 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fate of the sun-prone roofers, don't worry about them. They get 
used to it, said roofer Ron Gregory, owner of Star Roofing Co. in Los Angeles. 
Roofers become acclimated to the heat and drink plenty of fluids, he said. It 
helps to work in the early morning and late evening and take the hot afternoons 
off, Gregory said.  
</P>
<P>
 But not always. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a couple of guys doing a coating job today. They could have gotten 
it over with in the morning, but they wanted to watch a World Cup soccer game 
on TV, so they went up in the afternoon," Gregory said. "Hottest" Jobs 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the industries accounting for the most heat-related injuries reported 
to the state of California in 1991: 
</P>
<P>
 State and local government (fire fighters, highway workers, etc.): 32% 
Construction: 19% Agriculture: 13% Service industries (theme parks, 
restaurants, gas stations): 13% Other (manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail, 
transportation): 24% 
</P>
<P>
 Note: figures may not add up to 100% because of rounding.

COPING WITH THE WEAK DOLLAR; BENTSEN VOICES STRONG SUPPORT FOR DOLLAR; 
CURRENCY: BUT TREASURY SECRETARY'S BID TO RALLY THE GREENBACK FAILS TO KEEP IT 
FROM HITTING NEW LOW AGAINST THE YEN.

<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen issued a strong defense of the dollar Tuesday 
and said the Clinton Administration has no interest in seeing its value fall, 
but his remarks were virtually ignored in early trading today in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it was the Clinton Adminstration's most forceful statement yet on 
the current turmoil in the currency markets, the dollar fell in Japan to touch 
a new global postwar low of 99.10 yen before closing the morning at 99.37 yen. 
The dollar closed the day Tuesday in New York at 99.95 yen.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't explain the details or how to raise the dollar rate against other 
currencies," said Shigeru Akiba, branch manager of UBS Securities Ltd. in 
Tokyo. "The market didn't think about Bentsen's comments as a positive factor 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's carefully worded remarks, delivered in New York, were intended to 
send an unequivocal message of support that could not be overlooked by the 
global money markets.  
</P>
<P>
 "We believe a stronger dollar is better for our economy and better for the 
world's economy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech came at the end of a day in which the dollar, particularly volatile 
in the past week, continued to flirt with record low values in relation to the 
Japanese yen.  
</P>
<P>
 In the sensitive world of currency trading, little more than a wink and a nod 
from an official such as Bentsen can send prices spiraling upward or downward. 
Thus, Bentsen has been particularly careful in the past year to say no more or 
less than he wants when talking about the value of the dollar relative to other 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In an address to the Foreign Policy Assn. of New York, Bentsen said the 
volatility in the currency markets, despite the United States' strong economic 
performance, had become "a major concern of mine." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are people who think we have some strategy in Washington of 
driving down dollars or using the dollar as some kind of bargaining chip," he 
said. "Let me say clearly -- and I speak for the entire Administration -- this 
is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 His statement came on the heels of suggestions that have circulated 
persistently in Washington that Bentsen and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor privately favor a weaker dollar as a means of dealing with the U.S. 
trade deficit with Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 A dollar that is worth less compared to the yen would theoretically make 
Japanese goods more expensive in the United States and U.S. goods more 
affordable in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar is not a tool of our trade policy," Bentsen said. "We do care 
about exporting more. But we want to achieve more exports by helping American 
producers, by opening markets and by encouraging growth in foreign economies, 
not by devaluing our currency." 
</P>
<P>
 In the carefully choreographed world of international currency activities, 
Bentsen's speech was timed to take place after trading had ended in the United 
States but at the start of the trading day in Asia.  
</P>
<P>
 But there is a large degree of skepticism among experts that the 
Administration can have a significant impact on the currency traders with words 
alone. Rather, the belief is that it will take noticeable increases in interest 
rates to attract support for the dollar. Higher rates would give investments in 
dollars greater lasting value. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dollar began its most recent fall, the Administration had been largely 
silent, although it engineered a one-day effort by the central banks of 17 
major economies to purchase greenbacks in an effort to shore up the value of 
the dollar. The fall continued anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 In generally mild language, Bentsen had been offering signals of support, 
without stepping forcefully into the issue. But even his acknowledgment Monday 
that the subject of the dollar's value would be on the table next week when 
President Clinton and his counterparts from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, 
Italy and Japan meet in Naples, Italy, was enough to shake up stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's been waiting for something," a Treasury official said, adding, 
"This is something." 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Bentsen lauded the fundamental strength of the U.S. economy and 
said it has performed better than the economies in any of the six other major 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "No country can be indifferent to a fall in its currency, and the recent 
movements in the dollar could hurt recovery abroad," he said, referring to an 
important issue to the United States because of its heavy reliance on foreign 
purchases of U.S. goods in a global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nothing that has happened in the financial markets shakes my confidence 
in America's economic recovery and underlying soundness," he said.

JAMES FLANIGAN: COPING WITH THE WEAK DOLLAR; FOREIGNERS FED UP WITH THE U.S. 
DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The real reason the dollar has been sinking like a stone is not emotional 
questions about Clinton Administration foreign policy or pending trade wars. 
It's simply that foreign governments and private investors have been dumping 
U.S. stocks, bonds and Treasury securities for most of this year -- $38 billion 
in the first quarter, possibly as much again in April, May and June, for which 
statistics are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreigners have been selling stocks and bonds for the same reason American 
investors have: They saw rising interest rates hurting the U.S. economy, says 
Edward M. Bernstein, one of America's true currency experts, a veteran of the 
1944 conference at Bretton Woods, N.H., that set up the post-World War II 
international monetary system. 
</P>
<P>
 But that conflicts with conventional thinking, which says the Federal Reserve 
must raise interest rates to forestall inflation and defend the dollar. In 
fact, all sorts of experts are shouting at the Fed to raise rates again next 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But that could be disastrous, says Bernstein, who is now 89 but comes in every 
morning at 7:45 to an office at Washington's Brookings Institution. "If the Fed 
raises interest rates again, it would lead to more selling of U.S. securities 
and further declines in the dollar," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The conventional thinking is flawed, he is saying, and could well end up 
sending the economy into recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The markets seem to agree. On Tuesday, fears of new Fed action weakened the 
dollar along with stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the falling dollar evidently does not reflect doubts about the underlying 
value of U.S. businesses. On the contrary, the dollar is seen as creating 
bargains for overseas companies wanting to acquire U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerber Products, the baby foods company, and drug company Syntex Ltd. are 
being acquired by two Swiss companies, Sandoz and Hoffman La Roche. The fact 
that the dollar has fallen 10% against the Swiss franc in the last year makes 
such deals attractive. Wall Street pros expect acquisitions by European firms 
to boom. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some action from Japan, but most of it will come from Europe," 
says one investment manager. 
</P>
<P>
 It's logical that the same cheap dollar that makes U.S exports attractive 
should make whole companies seem like bargains. But it's sometimes hard to 
gauge value in modern currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's decline in the dollar, Bernstein explains, has been the result of 
portfolio transactions -- foreign central banks reduced purchases of U.S. 
Treasury securities by $21.4 billion in the first quarter and private investors 
sold another $17.7 billion worth of U.S. stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 That started cascades of selling by the thousands of global participants who 
trade $880 billion worth of currencies every day. Often called "speculators," 
such traders are ordinary corporate treasurers, managers of pension funds and 
bankers -- white-collar workers of the world charged with earning a return on 
an ocean of investable cash. 
</P>
<P>
 But just like the ocean, the currency markets must be approached with caution, 
says Bernstein, an economist with degrees from the University of Chicago and 
Harvard. As a Treasury official in 1944, Bernstein assisted Undersecretary 
Harry Dexter White and the famed British economist John Maynard Keynes as they 
put together the Bretton Woods agreement that fixed the world's exchange rates 
against the U.S. dollar, which was then pegged to gold. 
</P>
<P>
 That system, and U.S. power, stabilized the world's money and allowed for an 
unprecedented surge of prosperity. But the system broke down in the late '60s 
when expenditures for the Vietnam War flooded the world with dollars. Foreign 
governments balked at holding those dollars at an artificially fixed rate. So 
the United States ended the connection to gold and allowed the dollar to float 
against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 That system continues to this day, although it is running into crises as 
violent fluctuations impose a burden on international business. 
</P>
<P>
 As a solution, Bernstein counsels the world's leading nations -- the United 
States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, which meet next week 
in Naples, Italy -- to bring their currencies back into a system of semi-fixed 
exchange rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might fluctuate 10% against each other," he says, indicating a range of 
1.60 to 1.75 marks to the dollar and 100 to 110 yen. To keep to such a regimen, 
nations would have to coordinate their monetary policies and give up some 
independence of action for the common good. 
</P>
<P>
 But independence of action is already an illusion; markets dictate policy. In 
the past week, for example, the Fed has "intervened" in the currency markets, 
buying up dollars in a vain attempt to support their value. By that very 
action, the Fed tightened the U.S. money supply and, in effect, raised interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 So if the Fed goes ahead and raises rates further next Tuesday, it's easy to 
see how that might provoke a downturn in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it's so easy, why don't people in Washington see it? Because most 
officials in Washington don't understand modern currency markets. For most of 
its history, the United States hasn't worried about its currency, or thought it 
could be used for easy advantage in trade. Last year, Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen called for a weak dollar to aid U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday night in a major speech in New York, Bentsen changed his tune. It 
appears that all those foreign governments and private investors selling 
dollars have sent a message: The system needs changing again, they've said, and 
the United States better take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's fluctuations have become "a major concern of mine," Bentsen said. 
And he added: "We believe a stronger dollar is better for our economy and 
better for the world's economy." Watch the markets to see whether his words can 
bring that about.

 Former Lockheed Executive Labeled Fugitive: A federal magistrate issued an 
arrest warrant for Suleiman Nassar after he failed to appear for arraignment on 
corruption and fraud charges tied to a $79-million aircraft sale to Egypt. The 
warrant brands Nassar a fugitive from justice, and U.S. officials said 
Washington is expected to seek his extradition from Switzerland, where he is 
believed to be living.Nassar was regional vice president for Lockheed Corp. 
International in Geneva in 1989 when the California-based defense contractor 
secured a contract from the Egyptian government for the sale of three C-130 
transport planes. Meanwhile, attorneys for Lockheed entered a not-guilty plea 
to charges handed down last week in a federal grand jury indictment against the 
company. Allen Love, director of Middle East and North Africa sales for the 
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. in Marietta, Ga., pleaded not guilty late 
last week to the same charges, as well as one count of perjury.

 Justice Department Says Microsoft Antitrust Suit Near: Department officials 
said negotiations with Microsoft Corp. are in the final stages and that they 
are close to bringing a lawsuit against the company.They said Microsoft is 
trying to persuade the department not to bring a civil lawsuit stemming from a 
long-running federal antitrust investigation of the world's largest software 
company. But officials said an announcement could come soon, although it might 
be delayed at the last minute by the negotiations or by company appeals to 
senior Clinton Administration officials to review the case. The Redmond, 
Wash.-based company said action did not appear imminent because government 
lawyers are still asking for documents and information.

 Mobil to Take $315-Million Charge, Cut 2,300 Jobs: The Fairfax, Va.-based oil 
company said it will take the after-tax charge in the second quarter and cut 
20% of its chemical workers as part of an overhaul aimed at boosting profit. 
Mobil Corp.'s chemical profit has fallen sharply due to excess capacity in a 
depressed market. The company said it will set aside about $95 million in 
mostly non-cash charges for its chemical unit in the second quarter, partly to 
close some U.S. plastics fabrication operations. That charge is in addition to 
the $20 million Mobil reserved for restructuring in the fourth quarter of 1993.

 Japan Announces Plan to Deregulate Nation's Economy: A government reform panel 
released a set of wide-ranging proposals as a response to U.S. demands that 
Japan ease market access for foreign goods. The plan requires formal approval 
from the Cabinet, more work on details by individual ministries and, in some 
cases, passage by Parliament of new laws. Nevertheless, announcement of the 
proposals may be the strongest step Japan manages to take toward mollifying its 
trading partners before the July 8-10 Naples summit of leading industrialized 
nations.

 General Motors Promotes CFO: The auto maker elevated G. Richard Wagoner to 
president of its all-important North American automotive operations, GM's 
biggest and most troubled business unit.Chief Executive John Smith said the 
move, part of a slew of senior management changes approved by GM's board, will 
allow him to focus on long-term strategies. The changes, which have been the 
source of intense speculation for several months, mark the biggest executive 
realignment at GM since the company's board replaced Robert Stempel with Smith 
in November, 1992. GM also said it will separate its massive Automotive 
Components Group Worldwide from the North American operations unit.

UNOCAL MAY SELL ITS CALIFORNIA OIL FIELDS; ENERGY: THE LOS ANGELES-BASED 
COMPANY SAYS IT WANTS TO FOCUS ON OTHER ASSETS OVERSEAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unocal Corp. said Tuesday that it is negotiating to sell its California oil 
and natural gas assets, a divestment that would sever 103-year-old ties to oil 
fields that helped make it one of the world's largest oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Unocal said three outside companies have made offers for the 
California exploration and production assets, which include 69 oil and gas 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal said it is considering selling the assets in order to concentrate on 
larger overseas opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a company of Unocal's size to continue growing, it must pursue large, 
long-life projects," said Roger C. Beach, Unocal's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal said it received the unsolicited offers from Torch Energy Advisers, a 
Houston-based pension fund adviser and unit of Birmingham, Ala.-based Torchmark 
Corp.; Tulsa, Okla.-based Vintage Petroleum Inc., operating in partnership with 
Venoco Inc. of Santa Barbara, and Contour Production Co., a closely held 
Houston company. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal spokesman Barry Lane declined to estimate the market value of the 
properties, which generate about 33,000 barrels of oil and 80 million cubic 
feet of natural gas a day. Last week, Unocal sold 12 smaller oil and gas fields 
for about $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sale would be much bigger," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assets Unocal is putting on the block include 10 producing platforms off 
the California coast in state and federal waters. Unocal will keep other major 
operations in California, Lane said, including its Los Angeles headquarters, 
three refineries and a chain of 1,200 service stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe California does have some opportunities for growth" in oil and gas 
production, he said. "But incremental growth for Unocal? It's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Beach said Unocal will invest any sale proceeds in "significant growth 
opportunities in Unocal's strategic areas of interest, such as the Gulf of 
Mexico and Southeast Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also wants to accelerate development of other North American 
assets, primarily natural gas reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. It also hopes to 
speed development of the Salak and Sarulla geothermal projects in Indonesia, 
expand natural gas fields and develop new fields in Thailand and Indonesia, and 
develop the Yadana gas field off the coast of Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're entering a dynamic new chapter in Unocal's history, with a strong focus 
on natural gas development in the expanding markets of Asia," Beach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal now produces about 257,000 barrels of oil a day, a little more than 
half of which comes from U.S. wells, along with 1.8 billion cubic feet of 
natural gas, 1.1 billion of which is domestic. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst Donald F. Textor said the fields are yielding 
little profit for Unocal but have proven reserves that could be sold for $400 
million to $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal has sold nearly $2 billion in assets since 1988, including truck stop 
and shale oil businesses, and has turned from a national to a regional retailer 
of motor fuels, centering on California. Last week it sold 12 oil and gas 
fields in Texas, North Dakota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Wyoming 
for $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal said the discussions do not include the Point Pedernales offshore rig 
and several onshore fields near Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara 
County. It is already negotiating to sell those to Torch Energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal closed unchanged at $28.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

CONSUMERS FACE HIKE IN COFFEE PRICES; COMMODITIES: FOLGERS IS FIRST TO 
IMPLEMENT THE MARKUPS. OTHERS SAY THEY'LL FOLLOW SUIT IN WAKE OF BRAZILIAN CROP 
DAMAGE.

<P>
 The damaging frost in Brazil's coffee-growing regions is sending shivers 
thousands of miles away, as consumers face immediate increases in the price of 
packaged coffee and beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee prices on commodity exchanges rose to 7 1/2-year highs Monday and 
Tuesday following reports of crop-damaging frost in Brazil, the world's largest 
coffee producer. 
</P>
<P>
 While the beans affected won't reach breakfast tables for a year or more, food 
companies were quick to raise prices on coffee that has already been ordered 
and packaged and, in many cases, is sitting on grocers' shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble Co. was the first to raise prices, saying late Monday that it 
was increasing the price of its popular Folgers brand by 17%. It could pass 
along further hikes if the price of green, unroasted coffee continues to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are responding to the sharp increase by raising the price of Folgers by 40 
cents per 13 ounces," Procter & Gamble spokeswoman Wendy Jacques said. Folgers 
is sold in 13-, 26- and 39-ounce cans. The increase takes effect immediately, 
Jacques said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, along with everyone, we'll be watching the market closely to see 
if any further adjustments are needed," she said. 
</P>

 Nestle Beverage Co., which markets Hills Bros., Taster's Choice and Nescafe 
brands, and the A&P Coffee division of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., which 
markets the 8 O'Clock Coffee brand, said Tuesday that they will both raise 
their prices within days. 
</P>
<P>
 Nan Redmond, spokesperson for Kraft General Foods' Maxwell House Coffee, said 
the company is "studying the situation. We are discussing it right now, but we 
have no announcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Nestle, Maxwell House and Procter & Gamble hold about 70% of the retail coffee 
market, according to trade and industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffee companies' moves follow an astronomical rise in coffee futures to 
more than $1.73 a pound, compared to 86 cents a pound in late April. 
</P>
<P>
 A deep frost Sunday and Monday settled over vast sections of coffee-growing 
regions in Brazil, jeopardizing between 15% and 30% of next year's crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil produces 25% to 30% of the world's coffee, so even a 15% loss in 
Brazilian output would translate into a 5% loss in global output, said 
Accu-Weather, the international weather forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, spot July coffee contracts closed up 10.55 cents to $1.70 a pound 
on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. On Monday, July coffee 
futures jumped 33.8 cents to $1.59 a pound after peaking earlier at $1.80, the 
highest since November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's spike was just the latest in a series of market factors that have 
combined to produce the highest prices for unroasted coffee since the fall of 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Depressed prices in the mid-1980s turned coffee growers away from their crops 
in search of higher profits, and the scarcity of beans is now surfacing. In an 
effort to prop up prices, member nations of the Assn. of Coffee Producing 
Countries in October introduced a plan to retain a percentage of exports and 
thereby drain reserves in consumer countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan worked, and prices have climbed steadily since the end of 
1993.COMMODITIES

U.S. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AT 4-YEAR HIGH; ECONOMY: THE SALE OF NEW HOMES ROSE 
4.2% DURING MAY AS INTEREST RATE WORRIES WERE TEMPERED. 
</P>

<P>
 Americans' confidence in the economy is at its highest level in nearly four 
years, according to a business group survey released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the government reported that sales of new homes increased 
sharply in May despite the effects of higher mortgage interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped to 92 in June, 
compared to a revised 88.9 in May. May's reading was originally reported at 
87.6. The confidence index hasn't been as high since its 101.7 level in July, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest survey, the Conference Board said consumers' assessment of 
prevailing economic conditions registered a "good gain," but expectations for 
the months ahead were only marginally more positive than in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists had expected a June reading of 89.2. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer confidence survey, compiled monthly by the private business group 
in New York, is based on a representative sample of 5,000 U.S. households. It 
is based on an index of 100 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, slightly more respondents in June than in May described 
business conditions as "good."  
</P>
<P>
 Regarding jobs, however, less than 30% of the respondents said they are "hard 
to get," although the number reporting jobs are "plentiful" continued to be 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 Job creation continues to be the focal point for consumers, the survey noted, 
but Michelle Colley Laughlin, an economist at Sanwa Securities, said 
individuals' job concerns appear to have relaxed somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Conference Board survey is the consumer sentiment gauge most closely 
correlated with employment, and it supports our forecast for strong jobs growth 
in June," Laughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development reported that 
new home sales rose 4.2% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 738,000 
units and were a strong 16% higher than levels a year earlier, when they were 
at a 635,000-unit rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the effects of higher mortgage rates, which sent new homes sales 
lower in April, were tempered by growing consumer confidence in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many analysts said sales may have reached their 1994 peak and will 
taper off while remaining at the highest level in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist David Lereah of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. said he suspects the 
housing market gave its best shot in May, when sales rose 4.2% despite the most 
expensive mortgages in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales totaled 738,000 at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate, up from a 
revised 708,000 in April, the departments reported. Consumer Confidence

TELECOMMUTER POLL SHOWS LESS THAN 1% PARTICIPATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Telecommuting remains slow to catch on with the American work force, a survey 
shows, with less than 1% of the employees whose organizations allow them to 
work from home taking advantage of the option. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide study, based on a poll of 155 employers, found that skeptical 
middle managers are the main obstacle preventing the more widespread practice 
of telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Managers won't give up control. They still can't trust that employees are 
working when they aren't present" in the conventional workplace, said Dana 
Zackin, co-author of the study commissioned by the Conference Board, a business 
research group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 While other studies have also found that only a tiny percentage of office 
workers do their jobs from home, what Zackin found most surprising was that the 
number remained low even at organizations that, at least on paper, endorse 
telecommuting. More than two-thirds of these employers also contributed to the 
cost of telecommuting, doing such things as paying for computers, telephone 
services and office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with losing control over employees, the survey suggests, middle managers 
resist telecommuting because they are concerned about their ability to meet 
customer needs and to treat telecommuting and non-telecommuting workers 
equitably. 
</P>
<P>
 The study comes amid the recent disappointment among many telecommuting 
proponents over the slow growth of the practice in Southern California after 
January's Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Many hoped that traffic problems stemming from quake-damaged freeways would 
prompt more people to work from home, using computers and fax machines, but 
rapid road repairs, resistance from middle managers and other factors limited 
the gains.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The health care industry took another step toward consolidation Tuesday as 
Foundation Health Corp. said it will buy CareFlorida Health Systems Inc. for 
$250 million in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation Health, a Rancho Cordova-based health maintenance organization with 
527,000 members, said it will use the acquisition of privately held CareFlorida 
to jump-start its planned expansion into Florida, one of the fastest-growing 
U.S. markets for managed care. Miami-based CareFlorida, also an HMO, provides 
managed care to about 146,000 members in south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction will dilute Foundation Health's earnings by about 5% this 
year, the company said.

ST. JUDE MEDICAL TO BUY SIEMENS PACESETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Siemens Pacesetter Inc., the Sylmar-based producer of cardiac pacemakers and 
other medical equipment, will be purchased for about $500 million by St. Jude 
Medical Inc., the world's leading maker of heart valves, the companies 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal will place St. Jude, based in St. Paul, Minn., in the top tier of 
pacing-device makers and will put both companies in a better position to 
compete in the rapidly changing health care industry, St. Jude Chief Executive 
Ronald A. Matricaria said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to be a market leader, have low-cost manufacturing and 
manufacture the highest-quality products that deliver clinical value," 
Matricaria said. "If you're a company that has that kind of profile, you're 
going to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is also a significant diversification for St. Jude, which last year 
took in 95% of its revenue from one product. The company, with about 700 
employees, earned $110 million on sales of $253 million in 1993. Siemens has 
about 1,300 employees worldwide and reported sales of $350 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase would also include the pacemaker operations of Siemens' cardiac 
systems division in Solna, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really brought in to get the company to diversify," said Matricaria, 
who joined St. Jude last year from Eli Lilly & Co., where he was head of the 
cardiac pacemaker unit. "We want to be a world leader in cardiac rhythm 
management in the broadest sense." 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Siemens' German parent said it opted to sell its 
cardiac stimulation business "to focus in core markets where our research and 
technological strengths are greatest." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, Siemens Pacesetter was beaten to the domestic market for 
defibrillator devices, which calm heartbeats, by its chief rival, Medtronic.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES; 
ATTORNEY INVENTS HELP FOR PROCESSING A PATENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL KARON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are just two absolute requirements for becoming a successful inventor: a 
certain amount of creativity and enough money to pay the legal fees and other 
expenses for obtaining a patent. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventors still have to supply the creativity, but a new personal computer 
program may help with the financial end. Called "Patent It Yourself," the 
software guides users through the entire patent application process, right up 
to mailing the paperwork to the patent office. 
</P>
<P>
 It also purports to free inventors from the need to hire a high-priced patent 
lawyer. Between filing and legal fees, a U.S. patent usually runs a minimum of 
$5,000. Some cost thousands more, and most of the money goes to legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The software is the brainchild of David Pressman, a San Francisco patent 
attorney with more than 30 years' experience. He is also the author of the book 
"Patent It Yourself," first published in 1979 and then updated and reissued in 
1985. It was the basis for the software, and its entire contents are available 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main purpose of the software is to lead people through the patent and 
demystify what is a mysterious process," Pressman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the "Patent It Yourself" program is designed to help inventors with 
the all-important task of properly describing their creations. That's the best 
way to ensure the maximum legal protection for the creation, Pressman said. The 
software contains all the official forms needed to apply for a patent and is 
filled with examples and explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially it helps the inventor evaluate the invention and write a 
preliminary written record so you can prove you invented it," Pressman said. 
"It also helps you evaluate the invention in terms of patentability and 
commercial value." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pressman wrote the software package with programmers from EDS Corp., the 
computer firm founded by Ross Perot, and Berkeley-based Nolo Press, publishers 
of both the book and the software. 
</P>
<P>
 Some patent attorneys warn against the do-it-yourself approach.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's dangerous," said Stephen Strauss, a partner at Fulwider, Patton, Lee & 
Utecht, a Westwood intellectual properties law firm. "Lay persons often won't 
understand the complexities involved, and sometimes with these how-to books you 
can make a mistake early on that can really hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
 Patent examiners will reject improperly worded applications and will sometimes 
even advise an applicant to hire a lawyer to clean up the mess, Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For inventors who plow ahead on their own despite such warnings, "Patent It 
Yourself" still won't remove all the pain. Between the basic application and 
licensing fees, a patent will set you back at least $900, and "Patent It 
Yourself" sells for $230. It runs on personal computers equipped with Microsoft 
Windows 3.1 or higher.

 Ameritech Information Access will offer on-line access to publicly available 
municipal information about Indianapolis and Marion County, Ind., beginning in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees for the service, called CivicLink, will be set by the city, and Ameritech 
will receive a share. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hatfield of the Indianapolis mayor's office said pricing information will 
be available shortly before the system goes on line. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessible by CivicLink will be information on civil lawsuits, marriage 
records, tax warrants, liens, land titles, permits, and criminal case 
summaries, events, histories, costs, fines and sentencing. Marion County 
officials say these areas account for up to 70% of all requests for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Ameritech Information Access, formed in March as a venture between Ameritech 
Corp. and BC Systems of British Columbia, hopes to sign similar contracts with 
other medium-sized cities and municipalities nationwide, said John Maloney, a 
company spokesman. CivicLink is AIA's "first and primary product," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with Indianapolis and Marion County is AIA's first. 
</P>
<P>
 Nynex Corp. operates a similar computer system, geared more toward individuals 
than businesses, in Vermont. VermontNet is less than a year old and has about 
600 users. Its basic charges range from $3 to $15 a month. Information services 
cost extra. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Brandow, a Nynex spokesman, said New Hampshire has shown interest in 
implementing a similar system.

IRVINE CO. EXEC TO JOIN WILSON'S REELECTION TEAM; POLITICS: LARRY THOMAS, AN 
OLD FRIEND, WILL BE THE SENIOR COUNSELOR AND 'HELP REFINE' THE CAMPAIGN 
MESSAGE. TWO OTHER KEY AIDES ADDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson shored up his campaign team Tuesday by appointing an old 
friend, Irvine Co. Senior Vice President Larry Thomas, as senior counselor to 
his reelection committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' appointment was part of a campaign restructuring announced by Wilson 
campaign manager George Gorton that includes two other past and present Wilson 
staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Others named as senior staffers to the governor's reelection effort were 
Kathleen Shanahan, the deputy secretary for economic development of the 
California Trade and Commerce Agency; and Marty Wilson, a senior vice president 
and managing director of the Sacramento office of Burson-Marsteller public 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan will become the deputy campaign manager overseeing day-to-day 
operations, and Wilson will serve as a senior counselor focusing on campaign 
fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who first worked for Gov. Wilson as his press secretary when Wilson 
was elected San Diego mayor in 1971, said he would be leaving the county's 
largest land owner and development firm to "help refine the message and the 
message delivery" for the Wilson campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "In doing so, I will be offering a hand to an old friend who I admire 
greatly," Thomas said in a letter announcing his decision to rejoin Wilson. He 
said in an interview that he had no plans to return to the Irvine Co. after the 
Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorton said in a prepared statement, "As we prepare for the general election 
campaign, I am extremely pleased that we have been able to augment our team 
with three such outstanding individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Republicans saw Thomas' move as being driven more by his personal 
relationship with Wilson and less by the governor's need to symbolically reach 
out to Orange County, which is counted on by statewide Republican candidates to 
give them 2-to-1 vote ratios needed to offset Democratic strongholds in Los 
Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has had a topsy-turvy relationship with Orange County's conservative 
Republicans, who registered a protest vote against the governor in the June 7 
primary by giving his virtually unknown opponent, businessman Ron Unz, almost 
43% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 While Republicans said they expect Wilson to win back the disaffected voters 
in November, Thomas' addition to the campaign team "doesn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Thomas) has been here, he's active in the county," said William Buck Johns, 
a Newport Beach developer and Wilson backer, who added that Thomas can provide 
overall support to the campaign. "Wilson needs all the good guys. You cannot 
have too many good guys, and I think Larry is one of the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Political research consultant Gary C. Lawrence said Thomas knows Wilson well 
enough to help explain the governor's "vision" to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once Wilson explains to the electorate what makes him tick, I think the 
conservatives are going to find a lot that they like," Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving as Wilson's press secretary in San Diego, Thomas worked for 
Wilson's ill-fated 1978 gubernatorial campaign, and then left politics after 
that election to join the Bechtel Corp. in San Francisco. In 1982, then-Gov. 
George Deukmejian appointed him as his press secretary. He ran Deukmejian's 
successful reelection campaign in 1986. Thomas later became press secretary for 
Vice President George Bush, a job he held for three months before joining the 
Irvine Co. in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The development firm itself has close ties to Wilson. In addition to past ties 
between corporate officers and Wilson, company owner Donald L. Bren is a 
longtime Wilson backer. The Irvine Co. and Bren together have donated $100,000 
this year to Wilson's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary H. Hunt, a senior vice president for the Irvine Co., said Thomas' 
decision was personal and had nothing to do with Bren's support for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry has been a tremendous resource for the company in the community and 
he's going to be sorely missed," Hunt said.

NATIONAL EDUCATION WILL SELL TRAINING CENTERS, LAY OFF 40; DIVESTITURE: COMPANY 
WILL TAKE $40-MILLION LOSS ON TROUBLED DIVISION, CONTINUE OPERATING THREE 
OTHERS.

<P>
 National Education Corp. said Tuesday it is selling its troubled National 
Educational Centers division to an unidentified buyer, laying off about 40 
headquarters employees and recording a $40-million loss on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Irvine, said it will stop admitting new students at six 
nationwide locations, which eventually will be closed. It plans to sell 27 
remaining post-secondary school training centers to a buyer it did not identify 
in a deal that it said could be completed by late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will continue to operate its three other divisions, which provide 
computer training, independent study programs and educational materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had losses in our (computer training division) but our other two 
divisions are having record years," said Jerome W. Cwiertnia, the company's 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 National Education laid off about 25% of the troubled division's corporate 
staff employees in Irvine. About 80 more employees will be laid off when the 
six centers close. There were no layoffs at the company's three remaining 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Students enrolled at all of National Education's schools, which offer courses 
such as medical and dental assistantship, electronics, computer technology and 
automotive repair, will be allowed to complete their course work, company 
executives said.

 "We are not going to leave any students stranded," Cwiertnia said. "We have 
proposed keeping the schools open so that, under any circumstance, they can 
complete their educations." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of May, National Education had 10,500 students enrolled at 33 
schools nationwide. About 1,850 students are attending classes at the six 
locations to be closed, including 225 at a Long Beach site. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in Anaheim, Los Angeles, Rosemead, Sacramento, San Francisco, San 
Jose, San Bernardino and Winnetka, Ill., will remain open and will continue to 
accept new students. 
</P>
<P>
 National Education has struggled for several years to right the troubled 
division. But Cwiertnia said Tuesday that an "increasingly restrictive 
regulatory environment" made it difficult for the company to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business doesn't look as promising as it did four or five years ago," 
Cwiertnia said. "The outlook has been impacted enough by regulations that we no 
longer want to be in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The schools have been hurt by federal regulations adopted three years ago to 
curtail skyrocketing student loan default rates, Cwiertnia said. The 
regulations prohibit an institution's current students from participating in 
some federal loan programs if a relatively high percentage of graduates have 
failed to pay back their loan obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, National Education attempted to lower its alumni default rate by 
closing 14 education centers where a relatively high percentages of graduates 
had failed to pay back loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently adopted federal regulations have also made it difficult to attract 
students in a cost-effective manner, Cwiertnia said. "Our business is a lot 
like the airlines," Cwiertnia said. "We've got a lot of available seats and the 
fixed costs are there, regardless of whether we're at 10% capacity or 98% 
capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 NEC's stock lost 37.5 cents a share to close at $5.50 in Tuesday's New York 
Stock Exchange trading. The stock traded as high as $30.875 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 National Education reported a $2.9-million net loss for the quarter ended 
March 31, compared to a $4.3-million loss for the same period a year earlier. 
First-quarter revenue fell to $77 million from $83 million.

RUSH IS ON FOR O.J. MEMENTOS; HOBBIES: THE DEMAND FOR TRADING CARDS AND OTHER 
COLLECTIBLES HAS JUMPED SINCE HIS ARREST. THE PRICES, TOO, ARE CLIMBING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Some people are doing more than just watching as the O.J. Simpson saga 
unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Autograph and sports memorabilia buffs are paying top dollar for trading 
cards, signed footballs and other collectibles linked to Simpson, now in jail 
in connection with the stabbing death of his ex-wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, people with stuff to sell are driving up prices by selling to 
people who don't usually collect things," said Pat Boyer, owner of Five Points 
Sports Cards in north Tustin. "It's always like this. Something terrible 
happens, and these people come out of the woodwork." 
</P>
<P>
 With his collegiate and professional football heroics and his subsequent roles 
as Hollywood actor and TV broadcaster, Simpson clearly was a fan favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have been one of the players we would have been interested in," said 
Camron Bussard, a spokesman for Carlsbad-based Upper Deck Authenticated, which 
markets high-end sports memorabilia autographed by some of the sporting world's 
best-known figures. "Players from his generation still have lots of fan 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
 A Fleetville, Pa., trading card company said Tuesday it is moving ahead with a 
plan to have Simpson sign 1,000 cards that will be sold later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Signature Rookies spokesman Paul Golden said Simpson will be able to sign the 
cards even if he remains in jail. Neither Simpson's personal attorney, Leroy 
Taft, nor his defense attorney, Robert Shapiro, returned calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden said Simpson, who signed a contract June 3 to provide the autographs, 
is to be paid between $20,000 and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Simpson story has generated interest among fans nationwide, 
Southern Californians are paying the highest prices for autographs and 
mementos, said Tucker Smith, editor of Collector's Sportslook, a Congers, N.Y., 
publication that tracks collectible prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting reports of autographed balls going in the $250 to $300 range, 
and signed photos going for $30, both of which are double what they used to 
be," Smith said. "But it's a regional thing, driven mostly by L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Simpson's June 17 arrest, mint condition rookie cards featuring the 
former Buffalo Bills star running back were retailing nationwide for about 
$125. Since the arrest, some customers are paying $250 and more for top-quality 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans also are inquiring about football trading cards featuring Al Cowlings, a 
journeyman player who gained national fame when TV cameras captured him and 
Simpson as they drove through Orange and Los Angeles counties in a white Ford 
Bronco with a fleet of police cars in pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports memorabilia dealers caution inexperienced collectors to proceed with 
caution when it comes to Simpson items. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, when something like this happens -- the celebrity thing -- there are 
people out there who try to get whatever they can," said Joe Lester, manager of 
Baseball Card Dugout in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Fan interest in Simpson memorabilia, however, has not yet hit the level of 
demand generated by Magic Johnson's dramatic 1991 announcement that he had 
tested positive for HIV and was retiring from basketball, said John Brewart, 
owner of Brewart's Coins, Stamps and Baseball Cards in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simpson was never as close to the fans' hearts as Magic was," Brewart said. 
"And he was an active player, while O.J. has been out of the game for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy sold me his entire O.J. collection because he was disappointed in 
O.J.," Brewart said. "But for most others, the cards bring back memories of USC 
and the Bills and a guy people loved." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that, collectible experts say, the emotion that is pushing 
collectors to buy Simpson mementos will likely mean disgruntled customers when 
prices return to pre-arrest levels.  
</P>
<P>
 "My advice is that you're not going to make lots of money unless you sell 20 
minutes after you bought it," editor Smith said of Simpson memorabilia. "Prices 
will return to their pre-incident levels. It's yet another one of those cycles 
that this industry is famous for." 
</P>
<P>
 In a macabre twist, collectors acknowledged that Simpson memorabilia could 
again escalate in value, though, if the football-star-turned-broadcaster is 
found guilty of murder and is sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so unusual," Smith said. "Collectibles are usually tied to things 
like, 'Can a guy hit the ball long?' or 'Is he an offensive threat?' But this 
whole incident is like watching the Iran-Contra hearings on television, just to 
see what's going to happen next."

BRIEFCASE: AUTOS; IT'S A CRUDE JOKE: GAS PRICES PUMP UP JUST IN TIME FOR A 
FOURTH OF JULY TRIP 
</P>

<P>
 Don't look for gasoline prices to fall any time soon -- the Fourth of July 
weekend typically brings the highest costs of the summer travel period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Automobile Club of Southern California says the average price of a gallon 
of unleaded regular gasoline has jumped 7.1% since March -- to $1.20 a gallon 
from $1.12. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the average is a little lower than last year. The bad 
news is that crude oil hit a 14-month high 12 days ago, and that is likely to 
cause prices at the pump to rise another penny or so a gallon by early July.

FIRST PENSION ACCOUNTS MAY GO TO CAL-TRUST; RETIREMENT FUNDS: CLIENTS OF FAILED 
INVESTMENT FIRM ARE GIVEN HOPE OF ACCESS TO MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 More than 200 angry clients of failed First Pension Corp. packed a hearing 
room in U.S. Bankruptcy Court Tuesday for an update on the failed Irvine 
pension management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee James Joseph said a deal is underway to turn over client accounts to 
California Central Trust Bank, a Costa Mesa trust company with about $155.7 
million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the bankruptcy judge, the company, better known as Cal-Trust, 
would begin to manage accounts for First Pension's nearly 8,000 clients -- 
giving them access to their retirement funds for the first time since all 
company assets were frozen in late April. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that First Pension's 
owners operated an elaborate pyramid scheme, leading clients to invest in 
mortgages that did not exist. As much as $124 million of investors' money may 
have been lost to fraud and outright theft, investigators say.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph said Tuesday that $350,000 in investor funds has been recovered from an 
account in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Singapore money has been returned to the receiver, and we are expecting 
to recover other funds as part of the plea agreement," Joseph said. "It's a 
serious situation, we're all frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 The three principals, William E. Cooper, Robert E. Lindley and Valerie Jensen, 
did not attend the hearing. Earlier this month, all three agreed to plead 
guilty to unspecified future criminal charges stemming from an investigation 
into the workings of First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a separate trustee for Summit Trust Services, a Denver-based firm 
established by Cooper to handle his clients' money, who did not attend 
Tuesday's hearing.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: MERGER WILL CREATE MORTGAGE LENDER WITH $5.1-BILLION 
PORTFOLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victoria Mortgage Corp., a mortgage lending company, said Tuesday that it 
plans to merge with First Town Mortgage Corp. by the end of the summer. The two 
companies, which have signed a letter of intent to merge, would combine to 
create a mortgage lender with offices on both coasts and a portfolio of $5.1 
billion in servicing rights -- the fees that mortgage bankers collect to 
process monthly mortgage checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this very time when mortgage companies are increasingly ceding control to 
large banks, we are signaling a strong and clear intent to stay independent," 
said First Town's president, Peter R. Norden, who will be chairman and chief 
executive of the combined corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 First Town, based in Secaucus, N.J., and Victoria made a total of $2.3 billion 
of home mortgage loans last year as interest rates dropped to 25-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the two companies will retain their identities as separate 
operating units. The First Town unit will be headed by Norden. The Victoria 
unit will be managed by Larry Koppelman, president and chief operating officer 
of Victoria.

 Dealing Down: New-car dealers in Southern California say they are starting to 
see some improvement after four years of recession -- but Auto Age Dealer 
Business magazine's annual listing of the nation's top 500 dealerships shows 
that the economic slump has taken its toll here. 
</P>
<P>
 California used to dominate the list -- in 1990 there were 104 dealerships 
from the Golden State among the top 500 dealers by gross sales.In the latest 
rankings, for 1993, there are just 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Car buyers put 13 Orange County dealers on the list, down from 17 in 1990. 
That decline tracks the industry's overall fortunes: There were 150 new-car 
dealers in Orange County in 1990, but the county Motor Car Dealers Assn. only 
counts 117 this year.

 Foreign Report: Also reported by Auto Age: 
</P>
<P>
 * There was one less dealer from Orange County on the latest list than in 
1992, when there were 14, but total sales volume rose by 1% to $883.6 million. 
The increase came largely from increasing Japanese car prices. At David 
Wilson's Toyota of Orange, for example, the average new car went for $15,977 in 
1993 -- up 6.7% from $14,979 the previous year. Despite the higher average 
prices, Wilson's crew sold 290 more new cars last year than in 1992, keeping 
the franchise as the county's new-car volume leader, with 4,162 sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local dealerships that made the most recent Auto Age list were led by House 
of Imports in Buena Park. The Mercedes-Benz dealership sold 1,257 new cars for 
revenue of $65.4 million -- an average of $52,028 per car. Used cars, parts and 
other services brought the dealership's 1993 revenue to $120.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though House of Imports was the largest Mercedes-Benz dealership in the 
nation by sales, its total was down almost 5% from $126.8 million. And its 15th 
place overall ranking in the Auto Age list was down from 5th place for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three of the top five local dealers -- House of Imports, Toyota of Orange 
and Fletcher Jones Motor Cars -- sell foreign makes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ford dealers led the nation in total sales, and that held true in Orange 
County, which put four Ford dealers on the Auto Age 500. Together, Villa Ford 
in Orange, Ted Jones Ford, Buena Park, Tuttle-Click Ford, Irvine, and Campbell 
Ford, Garden Grove, sold 11,138 new cars, or almost half the 24,005 total for 
all 14 local dealers on the Auto Age list. 
</P>
<P>
 * The only other domestic franchise on the list was Connell Chevrolet-Geo in 
Costa Mesa, with 1,883 new-car sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crevier BMW in Santa Ana is a perennial fixture on the Auto Age list, and 
this year it also is the only BMW dealership in the nation to make the grade 
with revenue of $46.3 million.
