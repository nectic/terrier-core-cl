KILLER BEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My boyhood African friends would be amused at American panic over Africanized 
"killer bees" (March 13). 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a teen-ager in Northern Togoland, my brother, an African boy and I 
were trying to climb a baobab tree.I had just climbed up to the first branch 
when my brother used a slingshot to plunk a stone into a hive of bees in the 
adjacent tree. We were immediately attacked. When I got to the ground my 
brother and I started running through the 10-foot-tall grass, hoping that would 
allow us to escape. We swatted bees on our bodies and in our hair while running 
for about one-half mile, finally returning back to the house. Only then did we 
notice that our African friend hadn't come with us. 
</P>
<P>
 He was standing in the yard laughing at the stupid Americans. We noticed he 
was dust-covered, and asked him about it. He had just sat down and thrown up 
handfuls of dust until the attack quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we could learn something from people who have lived with these bees.

A BIG PUSH -- OR A BIG FLOP; NAFTA-CALIBER EFFORT IS NEEDED FOR HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though national health care reform is beginning to receive a full hearing in 
Congress, just what it all means remains vague in the minds of many Americans. 
That's why the battle for reform must be waged in the nation's heartlands as 
well as on Capitol Hill. So far the opponents of reform have managed to define 
it as something to be feared, as if all the affable Dr. Marcus Welbys of 
America stand to be rounded up, thrown in a gulag and replaced by automaton 
clock-punchers in white coats. The new television ads for President Clinton's 
reform plan are a start, but by no means are they enough. The President will 
need to do more. Before long the Administration may need to parallel the 
impressive, successful effort that it carried out on behalf of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT EASY TO SELL SO MUCH COMPLEXITY: And before the Capitol Hill lobbying 
effort goes full throttle, voter-constituents must be persuaded that the status 
quo in the health care system is not acceptable; that it's only a matter of 
time before they or someone they love will free-fall into one of the system's 
many holes. If there is fear and dread about the health care issue, Americans 
should be persuaded to also fear and dread the thought that they might be left 
out of the existing system; they must not be led by the enemies of reform to 
draw back from the complexities and difficulties of achieving reform. For 
without major reform, health insurance will continue to be unattainable for 
millions, people who thus will be denied everything but emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't help that health care reform is stuck with bureaucratic jargon like 
providers (that means hospitals, doctors and others that provide care) and 
health alliances (the purchasing groups that would provide leverage for 
insurance buyers). But health care reform need not be intimidating or 
hopelessly complicated. Californians already know that, because they are far 
ahead in one key aspect of reform: managed care. An astonishing 75% of insured 
Californians, or about 18 million, belong to some form of managed care. The 
success of Kaiser Permanente and other forms of managed medical care in 
California has not caused this state to sink into the Pacific (at least not 
yet). Nor will thoughtful national health care reform lead to the end of 
Everything Good in medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 BUT SELL THEY MUST IF IT IS TO FLY: It's the job of President Clinton, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton and health care reform advocates in Congress to come up with a 
plan that does not "fix" what is not broken. Thus the Clintons' often-expressed 
willingness to be flexible is crucial; some major elements of the Clinton 
health care proposal are in trouble because they seem unnecessarily intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all its troubles with Whitewater, the Clinton Administration had 
better find ways to end the fear of reform, and soon, or there will be no 
reform. As President Richard Nixon discovered when he tried to push for 
national health care changes in the early 1970s, the political moment, once 
passed, can be forever lost.

GIVE THEM A CHANCE, AND A SITE; BURKE'S LAW IS A MUCH BETTER IDEA FOR DAY 
LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subject of day laborers inspires angry feelings and loud debate. That has 
been the case recently in Ladera Heights, north of Inglewood, where residents 
sought to ban gatherings of the job seekers. Now, fortunately, County 
Supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke and her colleagues have withdrawn a plan 
that would have banned curbside job solicitation in some commercial parking 
lots and near homes, schools, playgrounds and churches in unincorporated parts 
of Los Angeles County, Ladera Heights among them. She has come up with a much 
better idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke's alternative -- supported by all except Supervisor Gloria Molina -- 
allows laborers to seek work on the sidewalks where they usually congregate; 
however, in commercial parking lots, where merchants sometimes object to the 
laborers' presence, they could be barred from most of the space if owners put 
aside a spot where people could look for work and post signs against the 
activity elsewhere. Laborers caught violating the restrictions would get up to 
six months in jail and be fined as such as $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This ordinance is not the final word on day labor, but it is preferable to the 
earlier measure. However, we think that local government is best engaged in 
this issue when it goes even further and helps to choose central hiring 
locations. That's better than having contractors cruising streets looking for 
workers, and preferable to job seekers scattered hither and yon, in potentially 
disruptive fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. City Councilman Joel Wachs has been considering the centralized approach 
at a site in Van Nuys. Council member Laura Chick has entertained the same idea 
for her district. Laguna Beach has operated an outdoor hiring site in an 
industrial area on Laguna Canyon Road for several years. A more comprehensive 
approach can be found in Orange, Brea and Costa Mesa, where hiring halls also 
offer English classes and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Such approaches minimize the potentially negative impact of crowds forming in 
scattered locations, and they also acknowledge that the laborers often are 
performing brutally menial -- although vitally needed -- tasks at the lowest of 
wages, jobs that not many people want.

L.A. WATCH; OLIVARES' LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Father Luis Olivares was controversial during his lifetime. The Roman Catholic 
priest was known widely for his work as pastor of Our Lady Queen of Angels 
Church, across from Olvera Street, in the 1980s.He declared that parish a 
sanctuary for refugees and illegal immigrants, clashing not just with 
government authorities but with church superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 While one could disagree with Olivares' outspoken politics, as this newspaper 
did on occasion, there was no doubting the sincerity of his convictions. He was 
arrested for them, and they appear even to have contributed to his death: He 
contracted AIDS after being injected with an unsterilized needle on a visit to 
Central American refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday Olivares' friends and supporters will mark the first anniversary of 
his death by celebrating a mariachi Mass in his memory and starting 
fund-raising for a $1-million endowment, the Luis Olivares Legacy. The fund, 
administered by the California Community Foundation, will support local efforts 
to help immigrants and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever else one thinks of the many immigrants who have made Los Angeles a 
modern-day Ellis Island, there is no denying their humanity and very real 
needs. It was within such a context that Father Olivares pursued his 
extraordinary ministry; any effort to carry on his work will help the 
community. This is a good cause inspired by the memory of a good man.

HIV TESTING FOR PREGNANT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The dramatic success of Zidovudine (AZT) in reducing the rate of HIV 
transmission from infected pregnant women to their infants provides 
encouragement and hope to the entire international AIDS community. It is the 
first study performed which shows that drug therapy can prevent HIV infection 
in exposed individuals. More important, each protected infant will be spared a 
long, costly and painful disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important implication of this study is the necessity for routine 
screening of all pregnant women for HIV infection. Never before has there been 
a therapeutic intervention to protect infants from the fatal consequences of 
maternally transmitted HIV. Because of these dramatic improvements in life 
expectancy, the Pediatric AIDS Foundation strongly recommends routine prenatal 
screening and counseling of pregnant women as the standard of care. Lifesaving 
preventive treatment cannot be ethically denied because of ineffective HIV 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
 There could be no more satisfying result than the prevention of HIV infection. 
Indeed, the cost of research in pediatric HIV/AIDS is justified by the result 
of this single study, which has the potential of preventing HIV infection in 
thousands of infants throughout the world.  
</P>
<P>
 The success of the reported clinical trial has not resolved all issues 
concerning the prevention of HIV transmission. The trial enrolled asymptomatic 
HIV-infected pregnant women. Will AZT work in women who are sicker or who 
receive less vigorous treatments? Can preventive treatment be made in 
developing countries where the cost of AZT is prohibitive? Can similar 
treatment with AZT prevent HIV transmission in health care workers after 
accidental inoculation (needle sticks)? Ongoing trials and continued research 
must address these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, there will be future issues concerning treatment failures. But 
failures must not be attributed to lack of public-health diligence in detecting 
HIV-infected pregnant women and offering to them early treatment and counseling 
regarding future pregnancies. It is now time to support strong public-health 
recommendations aimed at reducing the number of children who die with AIDS.

MENENDEZ TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having served on two juries for $5 a day, 15 cents a mile (one way) and the 
thanks of the judge, I find it amusing that Leslie Abramson, who has already 
earned a national reputation and been paid $740,000 to defend Erik Menendez, 
now asks the court to approve taxpayer funding for the second trial or remove 
her from the case because she "cannot afford to go bankrupt."

 * Judge Mills was wrong. He should have allowed the use of public funds to pay 
Abramson so she can continue to act as Erik Menendez's defense counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office bungled the first trial. The Menendez brothers 
should have been set free because of the verdicts. The court declined to do 
this and vowed the boys would have to undergo a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the county should pay for it if they wish to continue the circus. If 
they truly want to save the taxpayers' money, the case should be retired 
immediately.

STUDENT STATE TEST SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Students Fall Short in New State Tests," March 9: 
</P>
<P>
 Why is everyone so surprised that California schools are failing? You get what 
you pay for; and here in California that's not much. Let's get our priorities 
straight. The future of our country is education. Plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 KATHLEEN GALLAHER 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Is it really any surprise that our test scores are so low? As a teacher that 
has seen state bureaucrats, district administrators, education experts, and 
politicians use every gimmick in the world to cajole, manipulate, disguise and 
obfuscate testing scores, this comes as no surprise to my colleagues and 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
 What is interesting is that ignored realities do not evaporate after pompous 
declarations have been made by any of the previously mentioned interests. The 
realities are the following. Students are not challenged by their reading. They 
are not reading enough, let alone understanding what they read. Students and 
parents spend too much time watching television. Students live up or down to 
the expectations of their parents. Two-parent families have children who 
outperform those of single-parent families. Students need to do numerous pages 
of homework most nights of the week and do them well! They also need to be in 
school as much as possible. Lastly, you can tell students they need to learn, 
but they must also believe they "need" to learn.  
</P>
<P>
 It is time to focus on students working hard to meet academic challenges. 
Learning is hard work and when done properly very rewarding. R. TIMBERLAKE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * It's not surprising the overall results for mathematical tests were 
abysmally low. I have a bachelor's degree in math and a master's degree from 
MIT. It took me 15 minutes to figure out how to evaluate my son's school 
compared to some kind of averages or ordering. It was a multi-step process 
which most readers wouldn't bother with! 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the "guide to tables" says the numbers don't necessarily add to 
100%. If you look at the LAUSD Broadous Elementary School reading results for 
fourth grade the numbers add up to 94%. Even if each number was truncated down 
to a lower integer, the scores could never add to 94%. 
</P>
<P>
 If the administrators and teachers think those charts are useful and 
meaningful information (as opposed to data), it's no wonder the students do so 
poorly in practical math questions! Were the results so poor that the 
information had to be intentionally obfuscated to avoid public outcry? What 
happened to learned educators? 
</P>
<P>
 KENNETH W. GORMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * I know how hard teachers work, as I am a teacher. Do I dare admit I am a 
math teacher? I also know how hard most of my students work, and those that do 
work and study and practice are knowledgeable. I was appalled when I first saw 
the type of questions that would be asked of students on the CLAS test -- not 
because they were so hard, but because they were so vague, and because they 
could only be scored subjectively, based on someone else's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one question asked students to assume the role of a bowling team 
coach and determine which of two students, based on given bowling scores, 
should make the team. Highest points for the problem were not awarded for 
correctly averaging the scores and determining who had scored more pins, 
although that determination did earn some points. Highest scores were awarded 
to students who determined that the highest scorer shouldn't make the team 
because his scores were erratic. The team spot should go to the lower scorer 
because he was a more consistent bowler. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has surely been great time, effort, and money spent preparing 
and administering these tests, the bottom line is that they are scored based on 
someone's opinion, even though several people apparently read each test. Papers 
are lost, opinions differ, people get tired of reading through literally 
millions of documents. These tests represent an enormous drain on taxpayer 
dollars, and I believe they are so seriously flawed in presentation and 
evaluation that they will never be a valuable assessment tool for California 
schools.

 * I kept reading about whether or not the teachers were prepared for the tests 
-- familiar with the tests. How about some emphasis on the important factor, 
that is the students' preparations and familiarity with the subject matter, to 
the extent that they could pass any test given!

PYONGYANG DEEPENS SUSPICION; HARD TO AVOID CONCLUSION IT'S GOING NUCLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea's promise to cooperate with inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency has proven to be a sham. Frustrated IAEA inspectors have 
reported to their headquarters in Vienna that they were prevented from carrying 
out tests at a key nuclear laboratory north of Pyongyang. Those tests could 
have helped determine whether Kim Il Sung's Stalinist regime is diverting 
plutonium from power plants to weapons production, as U.S. intelligence 
agencies think. 
</P>
<P>
 This latest instance of duplicity inevitably deepens the suspicion that the 
north secretly is engaged in acquiring a nuclear arsenal. On Monday the board 
of governors of the 120-member IAEA will meet to decide what to do next. The 
United States, meanwhile, has rightly chosen to cancel a planned high-level 
meeting with a North Korean official next week to talk about improving 
relations. With the north failing to demonstrate any good faith at all, it 
would be absurd for Washington to do otherwise. The IAEA is responsible for 
policing compliance with the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. If it believes 
North Korea is cheating -- and it is becoming virtually impossible to reach any 
other conclusion -- it could refer the issue to the U.N. Security Council for 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 The sooner this is done, the better. The challenge raised by Pyongyang is not 
only to the United States and its allies in South Korea and Japan but to the 
integrity of the international treaty system, specifically the agreement to 
control the spread of nuclear weapons. In seeking to subvert that effort, North 
Korea -- the only state that is a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty 
that has so far refused to allow full inspections -- poses not just a regional 
but a global threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the Security Council to respond to it as such won't be easy. Most 
states, unless they perceive an immediate threat to their own interests, are 
more comfortable endorsing equivocation than supporting bold action. But a 
namby-pamby response that allows North Korea's cheating to go unpunished seems 
sure to invite further assaults on the treaty. So a lot more than North Korea's 
recalcitrance may be at stake here. Also to be considered is the larger threat 
that defiance implies for world stability.

CHANGING THE WAY L.A. IS GOVERNED; CHARTER REFORM: WE NEED TO RETHINK THE 
QUESTIONS OF POWER, ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE CITY'S RESPONSIVENESS TO ITS 
CITIZENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By XANDRA KAYDEN, Xandra Kayden, a visiting scholar at the Center for Politics 
and Policy at the Claremont Graduate School, is the author of Surviving Power 
(Free Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a lot of talk now about reinventing Los Angeles. While much can be 
done to change the way we do business, the big questions -- distribution of 
power, accountability and government responsiveness to its citizens -- would 
require a major revision of the city's charter. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues of who, how and when to rewrite the city's constitution are still 
in the debating stage. The current charter was written in the 1920s, and though 
it has been amended hundreds of times, there has not been a successful major 
reform; the last attempt was in 1970. All of the reform proposals have called 
for more power for the mayor and less for the council, but that is only one 
reason for resistance. The last failure was generally attributed to opposition 
by the city's employee unions, and to the absence of a sense of crisis. If 
there is one thing charter reform has going for it now, it is a sense of 
crisis. We own the image. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mayor Richard Riordan has looked favorably on revising the charter, the 
earthquake gave him a taste of what it is like to actually be able to say "do 
this" to someone and have it happen. The emergency powers -- and the shared 
goals of everyone in the city -- made it work for him and for us. In the long 
run, it won't be like that, and Riordan knows that as much as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 We are a city of laws, and while we may be strangling on them, we know the 
regulations came into being because someone, at some time, responded to a need. 
But needs change. Since the earthquake, the mayor has been saying it is easier 
to ask forgiveness than ask permission. Sooner or later, it is going to be 
clear that permission is a necessary part of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the question is how to go about changing the charter. We could continue to 
do it piecemeal (like the ethics and Police Department reforms); or we could 
mount a full-scale charter commission. The question of who would name a 
commission came up when Proposition 5 (which gave the City Council more 
authority over commissions) passed in the midst of the King/Gates controversy. 
There was a mini-movement among civic-minded citizens to create a charter 
commission and put it on the ballot by petition if the council declined to do 
so. But then the mayoral election came round and everyone decided to give the 
new mayor a chance to do it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The second issue is how the commission would function. One view is to get a 
small group of experts together to write a draft charter, and then present it 
to the council, or to the people by petition. Another view is to create a 
commission, and neighborhood charter committees to which issues such as 
accountability and the distribution of power would be brought for consensus. 
The committees would be supported by people trained in getting consensus, and 
they would provide something sorely lacking in the city today -- a mediating 
institution between our smaller communities and the government. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many permutations possible in the process of charter reform, 
including the examples in 1991 of the city's ethics and Christopher (police 
reform) commissions, entities named by government that raised funds from the 
private sector, held hearings and passed their reports to the council, with the 
threat of going the petition route if the council failed to act. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, the end result is the only critical issue. To others, the process is 
almost as important because it would give us an opportunity to experiment with 
ways of creating a government that works. We need a way to recognize the 
inevitable tension between the need for a citywide voice and the need for 
control over one's own life. We need to explore the real difference between a 
city that is homogeneous and expects little of government (the Los Angeles of 
the 1920s) and a city that is ethnically diverse, with competing notions of the 
role of government and real battles over the distribution of scarce resources. 
</P>
<P>
 How the charter is written will have an impact on its chances for passage. If 
it takes power from the Council, odds are the Council will oppose it. If it 
threatens the unions, so will they. If it is too complex and distant for the 
voters, they will certainly turn it down. On the other hand, if the process 
reaches out to those affected, educates the separate communities and builds a 
neighborhood constituency for charter reform, it might stand a reasonable 
chance of success. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to begin the process. It will take time to complete. It could be Mayor 
Riordan's best chance for turning Los Angeles around.

 Northwest Airlines Cuts Stock Offering Price: Lukewarm interest in the 
upcoming offering forced the company to slash the expected price for the stock 
by about 35%, sources close to the deal said. The offering, which had been 
expected as early as this week, has been pushed back until at least next week, 
the sources said.Northwest had initially planned to raise at least $380 million 
from the stock deal at a price of $19 to $21 per share. The new price of $13 to 
$14 per share means the airline would raise about $260 million to $280 million 
before paying underwriter fees. Northwest plans to use the money, as well as 
cash to be raised from a $400-million debt offering, to pay down debt borrowed 
to finance a 1989 leveraged buyout.

BOND YIELDS RETREAT ON ROSY INFLATION REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Another good inflation report sent yields for long-term Treasury bonds 
tumbling for a second straight day Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although profit taking carried the blue chip Dow average slightly lower in 
late trading, the broader market ended mostly higher. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 Before this week's reports on wholesale and consumer inflation, released 
Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, many bond market participants fretted that 
inflation was headed higher in 1994 after low levels the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the government reports this week allayed those concerns, pushing the 
30-year bond yield down to 6.79% from 6.87% at Tuesday's close. Its price, 
which moves in the opposite direction, jumped 15/16 point, or $9.38 per $1,000 
in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose 0.3% in 
the so-called core rate after having reported Tuesday that inflation at the 
wholesale level rose only 0.1% last month, excluding volatile energy and food 
prices. The combination of figures allayed concerns about inflation that had 
been aroused by the Federal Reserve Board on Feb. 4, when it raised short-term 
interest rates with the stated purpose of checking inflation pressures.Other 
Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials were in positive territory for most of the afternoon in 
sympathy with bonds, but gave up a substantial lead in the last few minutes of 
trading and closed marginally lower. The blue chip average closed at 3,848.15, 
down 1.44 points, after gaining more than 16 points earlier in the session. 
Volume was a hefty 306.82 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders attributed the Dow's volatility to Friday's scheduled triple 
expiration of options and contracts, and noted that the broader market 
performed much better. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 5 to 3 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes also finished higher, boosted by merger activity in 
technology companies. The NYSE's composite index rose 1.35 to 260.34. The 
Nasdaq index, heavy with smaller technology issues, rose 5.41 to 798.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the robustness in some smaller stocks, the market remains nervous 
about inflation. "There's still considerable anxiety in the background," said 
Oppenheimer & Co. Strategist Michael Metz. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Surgical rose 2 1/4 to 18 3/8 after it reported an improved earnings 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 * Citicorp rose 1 1/8 to 41 1/8 at interest rates fell in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kemper Corp. fell 2 at 59 3/4 as investors took profits in this brokerage 
stock after it soared more than 20 points following a takeover offer from GE 
Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nike Inc. Class B shares jumped 4 1/2 to 57 1/2. The company reported lower 
fiscal third quarter earnings late Tuesday but said its profit growth would 
likely resume in fiscal 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software companies Adobe Systems and Aldus Corp. said late Tuesday that they 
would merge through an exchange of stock valued at $525 million. The 
announcement pushed Adobe stock down 3 Wednesday to close at 29 1/2. Aldus 
surged 6 to 32 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telefonos de Mexico's American depositary shares led the NYSE activity and 
rose 7/8 to 61 3/4. The stock recovered from sharp losses along with Mexico's 
Bolsa, index which rose 20.20 points to 2,382.23 following an easing of 
political tensions in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Top Source Technologies was up 3/8 at 7 3/4 in heavy trading after 
forecasting a profitable second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * California Micro Devices soared 7 1/4 to 21 1/4. The company said Hitachi 
Metals will purchase 880,000 of its shares, or about 10%, for $24 per share, 
and to license its thin-film technology to Hitachi Metals in return for future 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas trading. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed 
up 168.92 points at 20,677.77. In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average ended at 
2,172.73, up 7.14 points, while London's Financial Times 100-share average fell 
24.5 points to 3,242.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold prices declined $2 to $384.90 on the New York Comex. Silver also fell, 
losing 8.5 cents to close at $5.377 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar closed lower in light trading.

 Brown sugar is ordinary refined sugar granules coated with a film of molasses. 
Florida Crystals Unbleached Cafe Sugar, on the other hand, is a "minimally 
processed" refined sugar -- 99.5% sucrose, rather than 99.9% -- so technically 
it's a pale tan, rather than brown. But it does retain, along with some trace 
elements, a faint molasses-like flavor. The granules are superfine size, so it 
dissolves more readily than white sugar, and the molasses content also makes it 
caramelize faster. In health and gourmet stores; call (800) SUGAR-A1 for a 
store in your vicinity. Green's Back

NOURUZ; AT LAST, CELEBRATING NEW YEAR'S THE OLD WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 March 20 is the ancient Persian New Year's Day, Nouruz. But Nouruz (rhymes 
with "no-lose") is not the heritage of Iran alone. Many neighboring countries 
also celebrate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the former Soviet regime, public celebration of Nouruz was outlawed in 
Central Asian republics such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. The 
holiday is of pre-Islamic origin, so it should have presented no threat to the 
Soviet Union's official atheism, but the Communist authorities may have feared 
that any popular traditional holiday threatened their cultural hegemony and 
might serve as a rallying point for resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 They had good reason for their apprehension. Stalin didn't manage to eliminate 
the last freedom fighters ( basmachis ) from Uzbekistan until the middle 1930s. 
By an irony of history, a number of basmachis took refuge in Afghanistan, where 
their sons and grandsons avenged them 50 years later in the Afghan War. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the new republics of Central Asia have 
been falling all over themselves to liberalize their cultural and religious 
policies. Mosques have been reopened; pilgrimage to Mecca, though limited by 
quota, is now permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And the New Year's festival (the Central Asian pronunciation is Nauroz, 
rhyming with "now rose") has been ostentatiously legalized. Huge banners 
reading "Have a Blessed Nauroz" were still hanging on public buildings in 
Tashkent last September, a good six months after the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, at the same time that the Central Asian countries are finally able 
to celebrate this ancient Iranian holiday, Shiite authorities in Iran have been 
trying to suppress it because of its pagan origins. As a result, Iranians 
living in our country often celebrate Nouruz with special fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Uzbekistan, sidewalk booksellers now sell a pamphlet explaining how to make 
the traditional Nauroz dish called sumalak (in Iran it's called samanu ). Only 
a few years ago it would have been a crime to publish the recipe. In the '70s, 
the Uzbek food writer Karim Makhmudov secretly made a videotape of the process 
of making sumalak because of the possibility that the tradition might be 
entirely lost one day; his family still shows the place where they hid the 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Nauroz/Nouruz traditions, sumalak is pregnant with symbolism of 
springtime and new life. To make it, you start sprouting a kilogram of wheat 
grains in a dark place a week or 10 days before Nauroz. The day before the 
holiday, you grind up the wheat grass and squeeze out the juices. Then you boil 
the juices in a huge pot with four kilograms of flour, a little oil, water as 
needed and a handful of pebbles (they bounce around in the pot and keep a burnt 
layer from building up on the bottom). If you start cooking it about 8 p.m., it 
should be done around mid-morning, 13 or 14 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result is thick, brown and sweet. "It is said," reads the sumalak 
pamphlet, "that the more people taste your sumalak , the greater a good deed it 
is. That is to say, sumalak isn't just a Nauroz dish but a friendship event, 
and a friendship food blessing as well." 
</P>
<P>
 With Nauroz/Nouruz coming this Saturday, it's a little late to start making 
sumalak / samanu now. Other traditional dishes for the holiday don't take so 
much planning. They are based on either the first vegetables of spring or the 
last staples of the winter pantry: meat stewed with butter and whole wheat ( 
halim ), carrot and cauliflower soup, a radish and cucumber salad garnished 
with dill and cilantro, mushrooms grilled on a skewer and little dumplings or 
ravioli filled with wild greens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spring herbs -- which can include wild greens such as shepherd's purse and 
clover -- give a fresh and unusual flavor to these ravioli. The original recipe 
calls for frying the filling in the tail fat of the local breed of sheep -- 
it's a soft fat, not hard and tallowy like ordinary lamb fat. In any case, it's 
obviously unavailable here, so this recipe substitutes butter. Sticklers for 
authenticity could mince a small piece of fat from a lamb chop and fry it to 
cracklings in the butter. NAUROZ RAVIOLI (Kok Chuchwara) 1/2 cup butter 1/2 
pound onions, finely diced 1 bunch green onions, finely chopped 2 pounds mixed 
spring greens, such as mint, cilantro, cress, sorrel, clover, shepherd's purse 
and wild spinach, all finely chopped 2 teaspoons salt Ground red pepper Noodle 
Paste squares, or won ton skins, cut in tiny squares 2 tablespoons melted 
butter 
</P>
<P>
 Melt 1/2 cup butter in wide pan over low heat. Fry diced onions until tender. 
Add green onions, mixed greens, salt and 2 teaspoons red pepper. Cook until 
greens are tender and reduced in size. Remove greens and reduce pan liquid by 
at least half. Mix reduced liquid into cooked greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Set out Noodle Paste squares. Place filling in center of 1 square. Lightly 
moisten square's edges. Fold square diagonally over filling to make triangle, 
pinch edges to seal, then fold opposite corners of triangle over each other and 
pinch together. Continue with remaining squares until filling is used up. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook ravioli in boiling water until done, 3 to 4 minutes. Using slotted spoon 
or colander, remove and drain ravioli. Place in warmed serving bowl. Toss with 
2 tablespoons melted butter. Season to taste with red pepper. Makes about 24 
ravioli, or 4 to 6 servings.

IN THE KITCHEN WITH ITALY'S GREAT SANTINIS; CUCINA: AFTER 42 YEARS ATOP THE 
RESTAURANT BUSINESS IN ITALY, BRUNA SANTINI COMES TO AMERICA AND FINDS THAT 
PASTA IS DIFFICULT TO TRANSLATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruna Santini is famous for her pasta. Not just among the residents of Runate 
-- her small hometown just north of Parma and roughly midway between Venice and 
Milan -- but all over Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dal Pescatore, the 30-seat family restaurant started by her father, is 
considered by many to be the best restaurant in the entire country. This year's 
"Guida Gambero Rosso," one of the two top restaurant guidebooks in Italy, 
raves: "The excellence of this restaurant can't be measured just by the high 
level of every single category." 
</P>
<P>
 The book's main competitor, "Le Guide de l'Espresso," isn't arguing. It 
awarded the restaurant 19 out of 20 possible points, noting: "This happy island 
of hospitality and eating is among the most welcoming that exists today. The 
Santinis are safeguarding the secrets of a cuisine that is genuine and 
exalted." 
</P>
<P>
 But right now Bruna, who is on a visit to the United States, is genuinely 
puzzled. This is the first time she has made pasta with American ingredients, 
and things are not going according to plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She started in the usual way: shaping a volcano of flour, beating eggs (four 
whole eggs and two extra yolks) in a well in the center, gradually pulling the 
walls of the volcano down into the beaten eggs. But at the point where a shiny, 
smooth ball of dough should have formed, she has a dry, cracking lump. It's the 
difference in the flour. She grabs another egg and beats it into the dough. 
That's somewhat better, but still not what she wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be bella e lucida , beautiful and shining," she says. But to her 
mind it is neither. "The flour in Italy is much softer and the pasta is much 
lighter. The egg yolks are a different color too. When we make pasta, we use 
our own eggs and it's almost the same color as this." She points to a 
deep-orange winter squash puree that will go into the filling. To understand 
how profoundly disturbing this might be, you have to remember that fresh pasta 
is one of the cornerstones of Bruna Santini's existence. She figures she has 
rolled out an average of 10 pounds of it almost every day for the last 42 years 
-- her tortelli di zucca are legendary. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, you don't get the feeling that Bruna is one to go crying over spoiled 
pasta. She has the mien of a dogged terrier. Once a job is finished, she moves 
on to the next, rarely talking. 
</P>
<P>
 The talking she leaves to her son Antonio, with whom she shares kitchen duties 
in his friends Marvin and Judy Zeidler's sunny Santa Monica kitchen. The 
Zeidlers, owners of several prominent Los Angeles restaurants, met the Santinis 
during a trip to Italy 15 years ago and struck up a friendship that continues 
to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Italy, Bruna runs the restaurant with Antonio and his wife, Nadia. 
Antonio takes care of the front; the women cook: Nadia makes appetizers, main 
courses and desserts; Bruna does the pasta. Antonio's father, Giovanni, is 
semi-retired, but he still makes the bread, takes care of the fish and tends 
the vegetable and herb gardens. Much more than a greeter at Dal Pescatore, 
Antonio acts almost as the curator -- a combination of maitre d', sommelier, 
manager and culinary conscience. "L'Espresso" describes him as "the charismatic 
leader" of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing's for sure: Antonio's a good shopper. At the Santa Monica Growers 
Market earlier in the day he wades through the crowds, inspecting every stall, 
picking up what looks best and bringing it close to his nose for a good, deep 
sniff. He does all this despite the fact that there are probably more people 
waiting in line for grapefruit than live in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes one quick charge through the market, determining exactly what is 
there and which produce he likes best, then he goes back to mop up, buying what 
he wants. Everything gets the smell test -- even spinach. And when he buys a 
bag of mixed lettuces, he picks through the bin, selecting them leaf by leaf. 
He's most impressed by the fruit -- the strawberries and dates in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 In the kitchen, he acts almost as a master of ceremonies: determining the type 
and order of dishes, explaining details of preparation and waxing eloquent in 
Italian on the finer points of culinary history or theory, while his mother 
demonstrates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio decides we should start with a simple early-spring frittata. Bruna 
quickly chops green onions fine and sets them to melt in a saute pan with 
butter. She adds chopped asparagus and spinach, then a touch of bouillon 
powder. To serve six, she beats seven eggs together with salt and pepper and 
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Over medium heat, she works the 
mixture as if for scrambled eggs, pushing in the sides and letting the liquid 
egg run onto the pan. When the whole thing is just about set, she turns the 
frittata out onto a pan lid and then slides it back into the pan on the other 
side. While it cooks a little longer, she keeps flipping the frittata back out 
to check for doneness. It's finished in not much more time than it took to read 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, when I make this at the restaurant, I do it with 50 eggs," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Antonio thinks, perhaps a risotto. Runate lies on the Oglio River (the 
nearest town of any size is Canneto sul'Oglio, population 4,561) and when his 
grandparents started the restaurant, the sign out front simply said "Fish and 
Wine." 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather fished; my grandmother fried," he says. Today, one of Dal 
Pescatore's specialties is a risotto made with wild onions and catfish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner does he mention it than Bruna sets to work. She cooks onion and 
butter together, then adds the rice (Vialone Nano, not Carnaroli or arborio) 
and stirs it until it makes a dry singing sound. This tostare is the key to 
developing the flavor of the dish. She adds boiling broth a bit at a time, 
keeping the mixture fairly loose. The rice never becomes completely dry. When 
the rice is cooked, some flaked cooked fish is added along with a big helping 
of chopped chives. The risotto is moderately soupy, with a distinguishable, 
slightly chalky bite to each grain of rice. 
</P>
<P>
 This, Antonio explains, is the way it is preferred in Mantua, the province in 
which Runate is located. "In Venice, they like their risotto soupy and their 
rice well cooked," he says. "In Milan, they like it thick and the rice al 
dente. We're right in the middle, so we get people from Venice saying it's 
underdone and people from Milan saying its overdone." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his obvious love of food, Antonio was never supposed to go into the 
restaurant business. His father sent him to the university in Milan, where he 
studied political science and in 1974 married Nadia, a fellow student. And, as 
he told an Italian newspaper, that's when his father told him: "To have a son 
graduate from college is a dream, and now I can sell the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sell the restaurant?" Antonio asked him. "My life, my world are here." He 
talked to Nadia. "What do you think about taking over the restaurant?," he 
asked her. "I will need your help. It will be hard but it will be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "She never said 'no' to me," Antonio adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So the couple took their honeymoon in France, visiting restaurants and 
learning what they could. Then they returned to Runate and began to redefine 
the restaurant, not as the rustic osteria it had been, nor as a Gualtiero 
Marchesi-style palace of nuova cucina. Rather their focus was on refining and 
revitalizing the traditional cuisine of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch, Antonio talks on and on about regional specialties and fine 
points of gastronomy (" E una cosa interessante (This is something 
interesting)," he says time and again). At almost every other sentence, Bruna 
jumps up to demonstrate one thing or another. He extols agrodolce , a 
sweet-and-sour pepper mixture that is served as a kind of salad along some 
frittatas. She slices a bunch of red and yellow peppers and puts them in a 
glass bowl, brings most of a bottle of vinegar to a boil with a little sugar 
and some salt, pours it over the peppers and tightly seals the bowl with 
plastic wrap. A while later we taste it with some olive oil and 
Parmigiano-Reggiano. "You can also do this with scallions," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When her son talks about gras pista , a lard-and-parsley spread that is served 
as a kind of cold cut, she asks whether there is any lard in the house. The 
Zeidlers, who keep a kosher kitchen, look horrified. Bruna merely looks 
disappointed that she can't demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's time to finish the tortelli. The filling is a roughly textured 
mixture of mostarda di cremona (a spicy mixture of fruits candied in a mustard 
syrup), crushed amaretti , bread crumbs, cheese and winter squash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which squash? Antonio says they use zucca Americana , but it doesn't sound 
familiar -- kind of like a yellow pumpkin. In an effort to clarify, Antonio 
points it out in the design of one of the restaurant's plates. But that squash, 
it's pointed out, is green. " Artisti ," he shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the market, we've picked up butternut and kabocha squash, but Bruna rejects 
both out of hand as being too soft -- though she is enthusiastic about the 
possibilities of frying thin slices of butternut as a part of a fritto misto.  
</P>
<P>
 After similar problems with bread crumbs (Bruna sniffs, then refuses packaged, 
grates some from sourdough, then throws up her hands), it's decided we'll use 
some filling they happen to have brought with them from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The tortelli , Antonio explains, is a widely celebrated dish. "It is food that 
is very happy and very social," he says. "In my family we serve it -- and only 
it -- on Christmas Eve, but we use a tomato sauce, which is the old way. In the 
old days, it was only served with tomato sauce, which showed off the pasta 
better. Now the point of view of fine gastronomy is that it's better served 
with Parmigiano and butter, which accent the filling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, there are regional differences as well. "In Cremona, it's made 
with only amaretti and Parmigiano," Antonio says. "In Ferrara, it's made with 
only squash and Parmigiano. In Mantua, it's made with squash, amaretti , 
mostarda , a little nutmeg and Parmigiano." 
</P>
<P>
 But all that is theory. Bruna is ready for a practical demonstration. She 
kneads and rolls out the pasta with an electric-powered machine, then cuts the 
thin sheet into squares. She puts a knob of stuffing slightly smaller than a 
walnut in the center of each square, using both hands to fill two squares at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she goes back down the line, sealing the pasta in the distinctive shape 
of the area. One corner is pressed against its diagonal opposite, making a 
triangle, then the base of the triangle is folded over and pressed again, 
making a shape like a paper hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruna gently places the tortelli in boiling water, then lines an oven-proof 
plate with Parmigiano. After the drained, cooked tortelli are slipped out onto 
the plate, a bit more cheese goes over the top, melted butter is poured over 
all and the whole thing is popped into a warm oven for five minutes or so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When it's done, the flavors are explosive and almost medieval, combining sweet 
squash with mustard-y hot mostarda and rich cheese and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruna rests for a moment, eating her portion and sipping a glass of wine. She 
smiles briefly and again apologizes because the pasta is not the way it is back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Antonio mentions pipasener , a homey type of ricotta cake specific to 
their region, and she jumps up to start putting together the batter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Santini is adamant about using Vialone Nano rice for this dish, but 
arborio will work almost as well. If you can find those little onions that look 
like scallions but have very rounded bulbs (cipollotti), use those for a more 
assertive onion flavor and cut the final amount of chives in half.  
</P>
<P>
 RISOTTO WITH CATFISH AND CHIVES (Risotto Con Pesce Gatto e Erba Cipollina) 
Juice 1/2 lemon 1 celery stalk, chopped 1/2 carrot, chopped 1/2 head fennel, 
chopped 1 3/4 pounds catfish fillets Fish or vegetable stock 5 tablespoons 
unsalted butter 1/2 onion, finely chopped Salt, pepper 1 cipollotto (wild onion 
or green onion), finely chopped 9 ounces Vialone Nano rice 2 tablespoons white 
wine 2 tablespoons chopped chives 
</P>
<P>
 In pot bring 4 cups water to boil with lemon, celery, carrot and fennel. 
Reduce to simmer and add catfish. Cook at bare simmer until just flaking, about 
6 to 10 minutes. Remove fish from poaching liquid. Reserve poaching liquid, 
adding enough fish stock or water to make 5 cups. Keep at boil for cooking 
risotto. 
</P>
<P>
 While fish is poaching, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat in skillet. 
Add onion and cook slowly, stirring, until onion is very tender. When onion is 
tender, add fish and cook several minutes more. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Let cool. When fish is cool, chop coarsely. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate saute pan, cook wild onion in 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat 
with dash salt and 2 tablespoons water. When water evaporates, add rice and 
cook several minutes, until rice makes dry "singing" sound when stirred. Add 1 
cup boiling stock and cook, stirring until almost all stock is absorbed by 
rice. Repeat, 1 cup at time, until rice is creamy and still bit chalky to bite, 
about 15 minutes. Add fish, wine and chives and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. 
When rice is cooked al dente, add remaining butter and stir vigorously so 
mixture becomes creamier. Makes 4 servings.

<P>
 This filling takes some adjusting to resemble the stuff the Santinis brought 
from home. Their Mostarda, which they make themselves every year, had a 
mustard-y bite that nearly brought tears to our eyes. The stuff we bought here, 
in an Italian specialty store, was much sweeter, so we added a bit of dried 
mustard to crank up the heat. Also, since we could find neither yellow pumpkin 
nor Hubbard squash on the day we shopped for testing materials, we used acorn 
squash. It worked fairly well but required some additional bread crumbs to 
become firm enough to hold together properly.  
</P>
<P>
 PUMPKIN TORTELLI (Tortelli di Zucca) 1 3/4 pounds yellow pumpkin or Hubbard 
squash 1/4 pound Mostarda di Cremona (fruit pickled in mustard), finely chopped 
2 ounces amaretti cookies, finely ground Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Nutmeg 
Salt, pepper 1/2 to 1 teaspoon dried mustard, optional 2 tablespoons bread 
crumbs, optional 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 3 eggs, beaten well 1/4 cup 
unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare filling up to 2 days in advance, but definitely before pasta is rolled 
out. Cut pumpkin or squash in sections, remove seeds. In pan bake at 350 
degrees until tender. Pass through food mill into large bowl. Add Mostarda, 
amaretti, 2 tablespoons cheese and dash ground nutmeg. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper. Mix well and taste. Filling should have definite mustard-heat. 
If not, add up to 1 teaspoon dried mustard. Filling should also be fairly firm 
and loosely hold together when formed in ball. If not, add up to 2 tablespoons 
bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl mix flour and eggs. Knead into smooth ball and wrap in plastic wrap. 
Set aside at least 1/2 hour. Divide in quarters and work with 1 portion at 
time, keeping rest tightly wrapped in plastic wrap. Knead and roll out on pasta 
machine to next-to-thinnest setting. Cut into long strip and cut strip at 
2-inch intervals into squares. 
</P>
<P>
 Place ball of stuffing slightly smaller than walnut in center of each 
rectangle. Diagonally fold over 1 corner of rectangle to meet opposite corner. 
Press to seal. Fold base of triangle over to form "paper hat" shape and press 
sides to seal. Set aside on floured kitchen towel and repeat until all dough is 
used up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle heated serving dish with 1 1/2 tablespoons cheese. Melt butter in 
saucepan. Cook tortelli in abundant boiling, salted water 4 to 5 minutes, until 
pasta is cooked. Remove with slotted spoon, working carefully to avoid breaking 
pasta. Place tortelli over cheese in serving dish. Sprinkle with another 1 1/2 
tablespoons cheese. Pour melted butter over. Toss gently. Makes 8 servings.

 This simple, homey cake is a breeze to put together. It's even easier if you 
can find lievito -- a special packaged leavening mix -- at a good Italian 
market. We couldn't, so we substituted baking powder, baking soda and vanilla 
extract -- and it worked just fine. The zabaione is very rich and wine-y and 
some people preferred the cake simply dusted with powdered sugar.  
</P>
<P>
 RICOTTA CAKE WITH ZABAIONE (Pipasener e Zabaione) 1 pound ricotta cheese, 
pressed through strainer 2 1/4 cups sugar 5 eggs 3 3/4 cups flour 3/4 cup dried 
currants 2 tablespoons rum 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 
teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 cup milk Zabaione 
</P>
<P>
 In large bowl, beat ricotta and sugar until creamy. Add eggs, beating after 
each addition, then flour. 
</P>
<P>
 If raisins are too dry, in bowl plump in warm water until soft, then drain. 
Blend into flour mixture with rum and oil. Add vanilla, baking powder, baking 
soda and milk to soften batter and blend. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon batter into buttered, floured bundt pan. Bake at 350 degrees 1 hour, 
until wood pick inserted in center comes out clean and sides begin to pull away 
from pan. Remove and cool. When ready to serve, slice and serve with Zabaione 
on side. Makes 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving, with Zabaione, contains about: 511 calories; 102 mg sodium; 222 
mg cholesterol; 12 grams fat; 85 grams carbohydrates; 13 grams protein; 0.39 
gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Zabaione 5 egg yolks 5 tablespoons sugar 5 tablespoons Marsala 
</P>
<P>
 Beat yolks and sugar until thick, creamy and light in color. Add Marsala and 
whisk well to combine. Cook over simmering water 10 minutes, whisking 
constantly. Makes 1 cup.

AN AMERICAN HOME COOK IN PARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone who has visited Paris is familiar with its restaurants, bistros, 
brasseries and cafes, and for devotees of French cooking it's a visit to the 
source, a culinary pilgrimage. But what Parisians cook and eat at home differs 
markedly from the cuisine served in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I spent time in the Buttes-Chaumont section of Paris, a traditional 
neighborhood, a former village that around the middle of the last century found 
itself enveloped by the city down the hill. My host, who had finished a major 
renovation of his apartment the day of my arrival, was very happy to have a 
cook in residence for a month. Needless to say, we threw lots of dinner parties 
to show off the new apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, I found myself in the neighborhood shopping street, much like any 
Parisian, traipsing around with the ubiquitous baguette under my arm, trying to 
balance my overladen basket of food. Between the Metro station and the 
apartment were two produce stands, three butchers, two poultry shops, two 
fishmongers, three bakeries plus two bread shops, a couple of convenience 
stores, some wine shops and the general store, or epicerie.  
</P>
<P>
 As if this were not sufficient, at the bottom of the shopping street was the 
Marche Carmes, a covered market dating from 1868 that sheltered, I found out 
shortly, an additional two dozen or so purveyors, including two kosher butchers 
and a Moroccan specialty shop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For most Parisians, shopping for food and cooking at home is a daily activity. 
It's also very social. Neighbors gossip and exchange news while shopping for 
the day's meals, and there's the feeling of a local fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The marchand des quatre saisons (greengrocer) hawks tomatoes from Sicily and 
Anjou pears from Morocco before the French crops come in. He'll tell you to 
bathe summer endive in a little sugar water for use in salads because when the 
weather turns warm the endive turns bitter. He advises you to simply shell the 
fava beans -- but not to bother peeling them -- when they're young, because the 
skins on the beans inside the pod are not at all a nuisance to eat. Beets are 
sold cooked in their jackets, ready to peel and eat. There's a special price 
for buying two types of lettuce rather than two heads of the same variety. (Is 
he concerned that we may serve a boring salad and perhaps blame him for selling 
us boring lettuce?) 
</P>
<P>
 There's new garlic, wild asparagus shoots, green beans, yellow wax beans, 
cauliflower, broccoli, cabbages, onions, garlic, zucchini, eggplant, peppers, 
celeriac, turnips, several varieties of potatoes, fresh herbs and fruits 
unimaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 One spring day, after a week of rain throughout northern France, the grocer 
alerted me to an anticipated arrival of cepes , the king of mushrooms, just in 
time for the weekend. On weekends, he told me, people spend more time cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as a woman explained to me one morning in the Marche Carmes, "On 
Wednesdays, I go alone to the market and look for bargains. I take my time. On 
Saturdays, I go with my husband. He doesn't want a bargain. He wants something 
fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 The dairyman sells milk (cow's, goat's and sheep's), cheese, yogurt and 
several kinds of butter. He asked if I were planning to serve the cheese that 
same evening, or should he sell me one that would be ripe the following day? 
</P>
<P>
 The triperie vends specialty meats; the charcutier makes pates and mousses and 
sells dry country sausages, salted pork, hams and prosciutto. The traiteur 
sells composed salads, coquilles St. Jacques ready to go under the broiler, 
marinated fish and seafood pates and mousses. 
</P>
<P>
 The butcher sells all cuts of beef, lamb, veal and pork. He prepares rolled 
and stuffed veal roasts, or pork loins garnished with prunes, ready to take 
home and pop in the oven. He asked for what dish I was intending the beef 
shoulder I'd pointed to, and then insisted I buy instead a more gelatinous cut 
from the shank to prepare my daube , a rich winey stew. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no less than a dozen kinds of fish on any given day at the 
neighborhood fishmonger, la poissonerie. She also sells cooked langoustines, 
shrimp, even lobsters and crabs, ready to take home and eat, and cooked bulots 
and bigorneaux , types of sea snails that you dip in a garlicky aioli 
mayonnaise. When I told her that I loved brandade -- a puree of salt cod, oil, 
garlic and cream -- she offered to soak a nice piece of salt cod for me to cook 
two days hence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever I returned to the market, there would be inquiries about the dinner 
in question, and the merchants took more than a little pride in having helped 
make the meal a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Parisians don't spend hours preparing the main meal of the day 
anymore, they still want to eat meals at home, together with family or friends. 
In Paris, eating at home is a refuge from the hassles of life in a densely 
crowded city. Cooking is perceived as a productive use of time, an activity 
that enhances the day. Good food is a symbol of well-being. You may be anxious 
and exhausted, but when you sit down at the table, all of life's bad things 
disappear for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin the meal by serving vegetables as a first course rather than as a side 
dish. This is typical. More common than dessert is a cheese plate served after 
the main dish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This recipe of my friend Eve Piacentini may be served hot, at room temperature 
or cold. If serving the cauliflower chilled, place in the refrigerator until 
cold. Do not refrigerate the dressing, though, or it will thicken up.  
</P>
<P>
 CAULIFLOWER WITH WATERCRESS VINAIGRETTE 4 baby cauliflowers or 1 large 
cauliflower, about 1 1/2 pounds total 1/3 cup trimmed watercress 1 teaspoon 
Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar 1 tablespoon sour cream 1/4 cup 
olive oil Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 If using large cauliflower, quarter it. Bring pan of salted water to boil and 
cook cauliflower until barely tender, about 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, combine watercress, mustard, vinegar and sour cream in blender and 
process until leaves are well pureed. Run blender on low speed and slowly add 
oil until incorporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Drain cauliflower 
well and arrange on plates. Drizzle some dressing over. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>

 An acquaintance, Philippe Lapeyre, teaches special education to disabled 
children. Since he's home by 4 o'clock every day, he is the cook in his family. 
His method for cooking fillets of delicate fish is to place them in simmering 
liquid, turn off the heat and let the fish cook by itself in the hot liquid 
until done. Since the water maintains a steady low temperature, the flesh 
maintains a creamy texture.  
</P>
<P>
 I tried this method with John Dory, sole, halibut and even frozen fish. They 
all come out more succulent than by normal cooking methods. Another advantage 
is that you can serve the first course without having to constantly monitor the 
fish as it's cooking on the stove. I also tried this recipe with different 
sauces. In one variation, Philippe substitutes finely chopped capers and 
anchovies for the watercress, which gives a briny flavor to the dish. He cooks 
fish about four times a week. He saves the poaching liquid and uses it about 
three times by adding some water to it as necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 POACHED STRIPED BASS IN CHIVE SAUCE 3 cups cold water 1 cup dry white wine 1 
small onion, sliced 1 small carrot, sliced 1 celery stalk, sliced 2 bay leaves 
1 1/2 pounds striped bass fillets Chive Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Combine water, wine, onion, carrot, celery and bay leaves in large saucepan. 
Cover and bring to boil over high heat. Cook 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce heat to low and add fish. If there's not enough liquid to cover, add 
enough hot water to cover. Cover and cook 1 minute. Remove from heat. Let 
fillets stand, covered, in hot liquid 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour Chive Sauce onto serving platter and sprinkle with chives. Remove fish 
from poaching liquid, arrange on sauce and serve. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chive Sauce 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 tablespoon butter 2 tablespoons 
lemon juice 1/2 cup poaching liquid 1 bunch chives, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Place onion in saucepan and add butter, lemon juice and poaching liquid. Bring 
to boil over high heat and boil until lightly emulsified, about 1 minute.  
</P>

 I insensitively asked a butcher in the March St. Quentin if he made sausages 
out of miscellaneous scraps of meat. "They are not dechets (scraps of meat). 
No, not at all." He was nearly speechless. "This is the same meat that I sell 
as steaks or for stews. It's first quality. It's just, how do you say, it isn't 
pretty enough to sell as steak or for stew." Scraps, I thought to myself. But 
to him they were not scraps because he respected them as much as the larger 
pieces that he could sell in handsomely portioned pieces. And he did not, he 
insisted, put much fat in his sausages, barely 4% to 5% -- "just enough to give 
du moelleux, moist texture. Anything more is filler and the sausages, when 
cooked, would shrink" -- as would his reputation as a butcher.  
</P>
<P>
 One woman at the Marche d'Aligre gave me this recipe for cooking pork 
sausages. She heats the skillet over high heat and sears the meat for about one 
minute on each side. Then she lowers the heat, adds potatoes and shallots and 
continues in the usual way.  
</P>
<P>
 SAUSAGES WITH POTATOES IN WHITE WINE 4 Italian-style sausages 1 pound small 
new potatoes, unpeeled 4 shallots, finely chopped 1/2 cup white wine 1 teaspoon 
chopped fresh or dried sage Salt Freshly ground pepper 1 tablespoon unsalted 
butter 
</P>
<P>
 Heat skillet over high heat. Place sausages in skillet and brown on 1 side, 
about 1 minute. Turn sausages and brown on other side. Reduce heat to medium 
and place potatoes and shallots in skillet. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover and cook over medium heat 5 minutes. Add wine, sage and salt and pepper 
to taste. Continue to cook until potatoes are tender, about 10 minutes. Add 
butter and mix to incorporate. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings.

 Leafy, green spinach is often used in salad along with mushrooms, hard-cooked 
eggs and bacon. But it also works well with steak and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some guidelines for its preparation. Since fresh spinach is sandy, it 
must be carefully cleaned before cooking. Remove the stems by pulling them off 
the leaves, then discard. Wash the leaves thoroughly by placing them in a sink 
full of cold water, lifting them out into a bowl and changing the water. Repeat 
rinsing two or three times or until no sand remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Frozen spinach can be substituted for fresh in recipes calling for cooked 
pureed spinach, although the flavor and texture will not be quite as good 
because frozen spinach also contains stems. Because frozen spinach is already 
blanched, it does not require cooking in water, but simply thawing; to save 
time, however, it can be cooked in boiling water until it thaws, then drained 
and squeezed according to the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh and frozen spinach vary in the amounts of actual cooked spinach 
obtainable from a certain weight. From 1 1/2 pounds of fresh spinach (weight 
including stems), I have most often obtained 3/4 cup puree, but occasionally 
only 1/2 cup. In comparing 10-ounce packages of frozen spinach of different 
brands, I have also found that they give between 1/2 cup and 3/4 cup puree. 
Keep this in mind if the exact quantity of puree is crucial to the recipe. 
</P>

 In the Provencal-style dish of grilled steak with garlic and spinach, sauteed 
garlic slices add a pleasant crunch and aroma to the steak. Instead of sirloin, 
Porterhouse, T-bone or club steak can be used. 
</P>
<P>
 A creamy spinach sauce is used in bow ties with spinach sauce and Gruyere 
cheese. This you make by simmering lightly cooked spinach in cream and 
seasoning it with its best partners -- nutmeg and cheese -- making a 
bright-green complement to the butterfly-shaped pasta. GRILLED STEAK WITH 
GARLIC AND SPINACH 9 garlic cloves Freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons Cognac 
or brandy 7 tablespoons olive oil 1 (1 1/2 pound) top sirloin steak, about 1 
inch thick 3 pounds fresh spinach, stems removed, leaves rinsed well, or 2 
(10-ounce) packages frozen leaf spinach 1 tablespoon butter Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Finely chop 4 garlic cloves. Combine chopped garlic with pepper to taste in 
small shallow dish. Stir in Cognac and 3 tablespoons olive oil. Trim off excess 
fat from steak. Add steak to dish and coat on all sides with Cognac mixture. 
Cover and marinate 2 hours at room temperature or overnight in refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Place fresh spinach in large saucepan of enough boiling salted water to cover. 
Return to boil and boil, uncovered, until just tender and wilted, about 2 
minutes. If using frozen spinach, cook according to package instructions until 
just separated. Drain spinach. Rinse with cold running water until cool and 
drain thoroughly. Squeeze spinach by handfuls to remove as much water as 
possible. Coarsely chop spinach with knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut remaining 5 garlic cloves into very thin lengthwise slices. Cover and set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare charcoal grill or heat ridged stop-top grill over high heat, or 
preheat broiler with rack about 3 inches from heat source. Remove steak from 
marinade and pat dry. Grill or broil until browned on both sides and done to 
taste, about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. (Rare meat does not resist 
when pressed, medium-rare meat resists slightly, medium-done meat resists 
slightly more, and meat that is well done is springy to touch.) Transfer to 
carving board and keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in medium skillet over low heat. Add garlic 
slices and cook until tender and lightly browned, turning occasionally, about 5 
minutes. Remove with slotted spoon. Add spinach to oil from cooking garlic and 
heat, stirring. Add butter and stir until absorbed. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, cut steak into thin slices. Place spinach on hot plates. Arrange 
steak slices on top. Season to taste with salt. Garnish with garlic slices. 
Makes 3 to 4 servings. BOW TIES WITH SPINACH SAUCE AND GRUYERE CHEESE 1 pound 
fresh spinach, stems removed, leaves rinsed well 3 tablespoons butter 2 medium 
shallots, minced 1 cup whipping cream Freshly grated nutmeg to taste Salt 
Freshly ground black pepper 8 ounces pasta bow ties or farfalle, or spirals 1 
cup finely shredded Gruyere cheese, preferably imported, plus extra for serving 
</P>
<P>
 Add spinach to large saucepan of enough boiling salted water to cover 
generously. Cook uncovered over high heat until wilted, about 2 minutes. Drain. 
Rinse with cold water and drain well. Squeeze out as much liquid as possible. 
Chop spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 Melt 1 tablespoon butter in medium saucepan over low heat. Add shallots and 
cook, stirring often, until tender but not brown. Add spinach and cook 1 
minute. Stir in 3/4 cup cream, nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste. Cook and 
stir over low heat until just heated through. Adjust seasonings to taste. 
(Sauce can be kept, covered, up to 1 day in refrigerator.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bring large pan of salted water to boil. Add pasta. Cook uncovered over high 
heat, stirring occasionally until tender but firm to bite, 6 to 8 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, heat sauce to simmer over low heat. Add remaining 1/4 cup cream and 
bring to simmer. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter and heat until blended. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain pasta well. Transfer to heated serving dish. Add sauce and toss to 
blend. Add 1 cup Gruyere cheese and toss again. Adjust seasonings to taste. 
Serve immediately with more cheese on side. Makes 4 first-course servings.

LOW FAT: LASAGNA LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Cakes (Chapters Publishing: 1993; $9.95).

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people imagine lasagna as a high-fat dish with loads of calories. This 
need not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 This low-fat version layers a nonfat ricotta cheese mixture with dry-sauteed 
mushrooms, fresh tomato sauce and lasagna noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 You can saute the mushrooms without oil by placing a non-stick skillet over 
high heat; once the pan is hot, add the mushrooms. The heat brings out the 
juices quickly and eliminates the need for butter or oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonfat ricotta cheese is now available in several brands at the market. With 
nonfat egg substitute, a little Parmesan cheese and some seasoning, it makes a 
rich-tasting cheese layer. 
</P>
<P>
 The fresh tomato sauce is easy to prepare, full of flavor and almost without 
fat. Of course, the flavor depends on the tomatoes you use. If you can't find 
flavorful tomatoes at the market, substitute canned, which are better than 
fresh when tomatoes are out of season. FRESH TOMATO LASAGNA 1/2 cup nonfat 
ricotta cheese 2 tablespoons nonfat egg substitute (equivalent to 1/2 egg) 1/4 
cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon chopped parsley Salt, pepper 1/4 pound 
shiitake mushrooms, sliced 1/4 pound button mushrooms, sliced Salt, pepper 3 
tablespoons shredded basil Herbed Tomato Sauce 4 cooked lasagna noodles, cut in 
half 
</P>
<P>
 Combine ricotta cheese, nonfat egg substitute and parsley in bowl. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook shiitake and button mushrooms in heated non-stick skillet, shaking pan 
and stirring just until mushrooms are tender. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Stir in 1 tablespoon shredded basil. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon 2 tablespoons Herbed Tomato Sauce into bottom of each of 2 individual 1 
1/2-cup baking dishes. Spread sauce evenly to cover bottom of dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange 2 pieces of lasagna noodles, cut to fit dish, on top of sauce in 1 
baking dish. Repeat with second baking dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon ricotta filling into baking dishes, then spoon over mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread 2 tablespoons Herbed Tomato Sauce over mushrooms in each dish. Then 
sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Top with remaining noodles, then spread remaining tomato sauce over noodles. 
Sprinkle top of each dish with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Bake at 375 
degrees 20 to 30 minutes or until hot through and browned on top. Sprinkle 1 
tablespoon shredded basil over top of each dish just before serving. Makes 2 
main-course servings or 4 side-dish servings.

 Each main-dish serving contains about: 338 calories; 763 mg sodium; 14 mg 
cholesterol; 8 grams fat; 54 grams carbohydrates; 20 grams protein; 4.49 grams

</P>
<P>
 Herbed Tomato Sauce 1 small onion, minced 1 large clove garlic, minced 1 
teaspoon olive oil 1 pound ripe tomatoes 6 fresh basil leaves, finely chopped 
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Saute onion and garlic in skillet with olive oil until tender. Stir in 
tomatoes and basil. Bring to simmer. Cook about 15 minutes, until sauce-like 
and thickened. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Makes 1 3/4 cups sauce.

AMERICA'S BEST: STOLLEN MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stollen has been the traditional Christmas bread of Germany for 600 years. 
Rich in butter, almonds and rum-soaked fruit, the loaf is dusted with powdered 
sugar and shaped into an oval that symbolizes the manger in Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, stollen is only available at Christmas. In Shepherdstown, W. Va., Ye 
Olde Sweet Shoppe Bakery sells 4,000 stollen at Christmastime, about one loaf 
per resident. But a few years ago, the bakery started making egg-shaped stollen 
for Easter.  
</P>
<P>
 Stollen came to the small college town 10 years ago, after Ye Shoppe's 
original owner was trained by a master baker in Germany. The bakery also 
specializes in strudels and heavy, hearty breads made from grains imported from 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The stollen is not expensive. A one-pound loaf costs $5, plus shipping. Kept 
tightly wrapped, a loaf will stay edible for six weeks, or up to six months 
frozen, so it's best to save on postage and order several at once.

GARDEN FRESH; THE DANDELION: A WEED IN ITS PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even the most city-bred among us at some time in childhood bent down and 
plucked a puff of dandelion, blew on it and watched, transfixed, as a zillion 
seeds on silken wings sailed away on the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Then some of us grew up to be gardeners and installed lawns. Rather than being 
transfixed by the blowballs, the adult in us now gets agitated. Out the plants 
come by their roots, usually with a curse. 
</P>
<P>
 Never was the definition of a weed more apt than for the dandelion: a plant 
out of place. Certainly dandelions don't belong in a manicured lawn. But with 
their raggedy leaves in ebullient rosettes, dandelions are a joy in the border. 
Set their sprays of green beside bright primroses and dahlias. Lend their 
sauciness to sedate sages and kales. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to childhood. If any of us knew the leaves beneath the puffs were good 
for us, there'd have been fewer seeds on the wind. No self-respecting child has 
anything to do with something healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So next time you pull up a dandelion when it's out of place (assuming it has 
never been sprayed), bring it into the kitchen. The thinnish, slightly 
succulent leaves are lightly bitter -- refreshing in the manner of curly 
endive. With its forgiving nature, dandelion will nourish you mightily. The raw 
leaves have twice the beta carotene of beet greens, as much iron as spinach and 
as much calcium as turnip greens.  
</P>
<P>
 In its season, every part of the dandelion can be enjoyed. As is the case with 
most plants, the leaves are tenderest and most delicately flavored before the 
plants flower. Of course, raw dandelion leaves are an enchanting addition to 
tossed salads. Pick them as small as you can so you'll have the pleasure of 
seeing a whole indented leaf -- don't waste the effect by tearing it into 
pieces.  
</P>
<P>
 If you nip off buds as they come along, you'll keep the leaves virginal. The 
trick is to have enough plants dappled through the garden so you can let some 
flowers bloom. Summer's small golden daisy-like flowers are also charming in 
salads. Were you to have bucketfuls, you could make a delicate and flowery 
golden wine (ask your local library for a book on homemade wines). And if you 
let a few flowers turn into fairy puffs, your supply of fresh plants for next 
season will be assured. Then in autumn, the large roots may be cooked as 
parsnips. Or slowly roast the roots until dry and dark brown, finely grind 
them, then brew them into a lusty sort of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Now dandelion leaves are classed as a potherb -- one of the greens that rise 
so easily in spring they're disprized. Potherbs are traditionally dropped into 
a simmering pot along with savory vegetables such as carrots and onions to make 
an invigorating soup.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also read about potherbs being cooked like spinach. For my part, I 
don't fancy a mess of boiled dandelion greens. Whether raw or barely cooked, I 
like to use them as an accent. I'm partial to slicing slender greens into 
ribbons. When a recipe calls for leaves of chicory, arugula, escarole, curly 
endive or Italian parsley, for example, I play with dandelion leaves in their 
place.  
</P>
<P>
 Bear in mind that, as with other greens that are wild at heart, lemon buffs 
the rough edges and makes dandelion's flavor shine. 
</P>
<P>
 Italians have a gift for lifting what others consider lowly to the inspired. 
Especially in compositions of pasta. Mix al dente rigatoni with chopped, 
softened sun-dried tomatoes, ribbons of dandelion leaves, thinly sliced celery, 
minced garlic (all these vegetables raw), olive oil and lemon juice. Toss 
piping-hot cheese tortellini with ribbons of dandelion leaves and fine shreds 
of lemon zest, dress with olive oil and wisps of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese 
(ready-to-cook tortellini are available in many deli cases). Chop dandelion 
leaves and mix with toasted pine nuts -- melted butter this time with the lemon 
juice -- into translucent egg noodles.  
</P>
<P>
 Another Italian way is to thread ribbons of raw dandelion leaves through rich 
broth, then top with grated cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The confusing thing is that when you see greens labeled Italian dandelions in 
the market or a catalogue, they're not dandelion but chicory. There are several 
dandelion-like chicories, and their leaves can grow a foot long. True dandelion 
leaves are rarely longer than the span of a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in these sensuous days when even water comes in designer flavors, there 
are designer dandelions. Naturally, they're French. They are refined forms of 
our childhood dandelion, the leaves a bit larger and the flavor a bit milder. 
With names such as Amelior and Verte de Montmagny, they are beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Dandelions are hardy perennials, that is, they'll be evergreen in a balmy 
garden and return after frost in a frosty garden for years. Although some say 
the plants lose quality after the first year and recommend pulling them up, I 
don't. I find that it depends on the plant's quality of life. Although they'll 
grow generously almost anywhere, what makes dandelions happy is well-drained 
soil in full sun, and they'll beam if their soil is fertile. 
</P>
<P>
 The refined sorts of dandelions do best when started indoors. For autumn 
eating, sow from the month before through the month of your last expected frost 
of spring -- or if you have no frost, any time in spring. Where it's very hot 
in summer and also where it's temperate, you can sow seeds in late summer for 
fresh dandelions over winter. Keep at about 60 degrees and don't let them dry 
out. When the plants have five or six leaves, set them in the garden, first 
hardening them off (for a week before transplanting, put them outside every 
day, then bring them in at night). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To plant, snip back the roots and tips of leaves by about one-quarter. This 
light pruning makes the plant throw its energy into vigorous roots and new 
leaves. Keep moist the plants you don't want to flower (dry soil causes them to 
start making seeds). Regularly pick leaves for salad from the center, those for 
cooking from the outside, to keep leaves coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Should dandelion leaves prove too bitter in late summer, blanch them. Although 
blanching cuts down on nutrients -- the deeper the green, the richer the 
Vitamin A -- pale dandelion leaves are as elegant as Belgian endive. And unlike 
Belgian endive, you can't buy them.  
</P>
<P>
 Wait until the plant is mature and the days are relatively cool (usually 
autumn or spring). Expect the plant to deteriorate once blanched, so either eat 
fast or do a few plants at a time. Make sure the leaves are bone-dry, or 
they'll mildew (if the plant is in the path of necessary watering, cover it 
with a bucket for a few days). Remove all dead or dying leaves. Gather up the 
leaves fairly tightly and tie with something soft about one-third down from the 
top. The outside leaves won't blanch, of course, but in 10 to 14 days, inside 
leaves will be creamy-white tinged with butter-yellow and will taste worlds 
sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still not mainstream, when you're looking for dandelions in seed catalogs, if 
they're not listed, look under Greens or Salad Greens or, as a last resort, 
under Herbs.  
</P>
<P>
 And when you pass dandelions in the grass, remember your childhood and return 
their smiles. Sources

 Greens and potatoes are a tasty pair, so I thought to make a salad of them. It 
turned out to be wonderfully versatile. According to your mood and menu, this 
may also be prepared with walnut oil and embellished with toasted walnuts or 
pine nuts . . . or with chopped, hard-cooked eggs . . . crumbled bacon . . . 
diced pimientos . . . matchsticks of softened sun- dried tomatoes . . . or 
cooked celery root . . . or make it a main dish with small shrimp or diced ham 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 When dandelions are scarce, I substitute part or all curly endive or another 
chicory -- any slightly bitter leaf that still has a vestige of crunch when 
wilted.  
</P>
<P>
 LEMONY SALAD OF NEW POTATOES AND DANDELIONS Cold water 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 
pounds unpeeled 2-inch red new potatoes 1 pound dandelion greens, including 
slender stalks, well rinsed (some part or all may be curly endive or other 
chicory) 1/2 cup chopped green onions, stalks included (green garlic, chives or 
Chinese chives may be substituted) 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 cup fresh 
lemon juice Salt Cayenne or freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 In 11-inch skillet add 1/2 inch cold water. Add salt to water and bring to 
boil. Quickly (so they don't discolor) slice potatoes crosswise scant 1/2-inch 
thick. Stack and slice crosswise same thickness into French frylike pieces. 
Drop into boiling water, stir, cover and return to boil over high heat. Adjust 
heat to maintain simmer and cook until barely tender, 12 to 15 minutes, 
stirring once or twice.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, stack greens and slice crosswise scant 1/2-inch wide. When potatoes 
are ready, heap greens on top, cover and simmer 1 minute. Holding lid, drain 
(save broth for soup). Turn into mixing bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 Add green onions, oil and lemon juice. Mix gently. Season to taste with salt. 
Salad is most flavorful warm but may be served at room temperature. If prepared 
in advance, bring to room temperature.  
</P>
<P>
 Season to taste with cayenne pepper. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>

 Each serving contains about: 156 calories; 380 mg sodium; trace cholesterol; 7

GOOD COOKING: A BANANA A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I know people who consider bananas the way others do apples: A banana a day 
keeps the doctor away. High in carbohydrates, low in protein and fats, bananas 
are rich in potassium and Vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
 Bananas are also one fruit that develops better flavor when ripened off the 
tree. Even though it can be maddening to find mostly green bananas at the 
market, they do ripen quickly at room temperature, especially when they are 
enclosed in a brown paper bag.  
</P>
<P>
 Once fully ripe and fragrant, bananas boost the flavor of the recipes they are 
used in. Besides enhancing flavor, the richness and thickness of ripe banana 
puree help reduce the fat in many recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider these recipes. The chocolate-banana cake and banana French toast work 
without the benefit of many egg yolks or much fat. Warm banana-maple syrup 
completes the pleasure of the French toast. The banana s'mores are delicious 
without chocolate chips. But if you can't resist, just a few -- instead of a 
whole chocolate slab -- will suffice. Try it -- I know you'll like it -- it's a 
quick, low-fat dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Banana boosts the moisture in this cake despite the relatively low amount of 
fat used. Because the batter is heavy, the cake bakes more quickly around the 
edges and is slightly lower in the center. That's not a problem as far as taste 
or presentation.  
</P>
<P>
 CHOCOLATE-BANANA CAKE 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 1 1/2 cups 
granulated sugar, divided 1 egg yolk 2 teaspoons vanilla 1/2 cup low-fat 
buttermilk 1 3/4 cups pureed ripe banana 1 3/4 cups cake flour 1/2 cup cocoa 
(preferably Dutch-process) 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 
teaspoon salt 3 egg whites 2 tablespoons powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Mix butter, 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar, egg yolk and vanilla together in bowl 
with electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add buttermilk and banana. Mix 
well.  
</P>
<P>
 Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Gradually add 
flour mixture to batter. Mix until very smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat egg whites in clean, grease-free mixing bowl until foamy. Gradually add 
remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar and continue beating until whites are soft 
and moist, yet hold their peaks. Gently fold whites into batter.  
</P>
<P>
 Transfer batter to greased and lightly floured 9-inch-square cake pan. Smooth 
surface with spatula. Bake on center oven rack at 350 degrees until wood pick 
inserted in center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool on rack at least 30 
minutes. Shake powdered sugar through fine sieve over cake before serving (it 
tastes best when served day it's baked). Makes 1 (9-inch) square cake, about 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 391 calories; 240 mg sodium; 58 mg cholesterol; 
11 grams fat; 73 grams carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 0.59 gram fiber.

</P>
<P>
 Use a blender or processor fitted with metal blade to completely mix the 
ingredients for the French toast. The warm maple syrup with slightly cooked 
bananas is a great enhancement.  
</P>
<P>
 BANANA FRENCH TOAST WITH WARM BANANA-MAPLE SYRUP 1 large ripe banana, pureed 
(about 2/3 cup) 2 egg whites 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1/3 cup 1% milk 6 slices 
day-old challah or brioche slices, about 3/4-inch thick Banana-Maple Syrup 
</P>
<P>
 Mix pureed banana, egg whites, cinnamon and milk in blender or processor 
fitted with metal blade. Transfer mixture to shallow pie plate.  
</P>
<P>
 Grease non-stick griddle and heat. Use tongs to soak bread slices on both 
sides until just saturated but not falling apart. When griddle is hot, cook 
toast over medium heat until browned on both sides. Keep warm in 200-degree 
oven while cooking rest. Serve warm with warm Banana-Maple Syrup. Makes 3 to 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 3 servings contains about: 574 calories; 462 mg sodium; 3 mg 
cholesterol; 3 grams fat; 130 grams carbohydrates; 11 grams protein; 0.96 gram 
fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Banana-Maple Syrup 3/4 cup maple syrup 3 medium bananas, cut into 1/4-inch 
slices 
</P>
<P>
 Simmer syrup and bananas in small saucepan until heated through and bananas 
just begin to turn translucent. Serve immediately. 
</P>

 S'Mores are time-honored campfire fare, but they also make a quick, satisfying 
dessert at home. Usually, chocolate is sandwiched between the graham crackers, 
but it's possible to omit the chocolate and still enjoy the oozing marshmallow 
and warm banana slices. On the other hand, if you can't resist, sprinkle just a 
few semisweet chocolate bits on the marshmallows.  
</P>
<P>
 BANANA S'MORES 8 whole graham crackers 2 medium bananas, thinly sliced 16 
marshmallows, snipped in half horizontally with kitchen shears 1/4 cup 
semisweet chocolate chips, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Place 4 graham crackers in single layer on baking sheet. Cover crackers with 
1/2 banana slices. Space 8 marshmallow halves evenly over each cracker. 
Sprinkle chocolate chips over top (if using). Arrange remaining banana slices 
over marshmallows, dividing evenly. Cover each with graham cracker to make 
sandwich. Cover S'Mores with tent of foil. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake on center oven rack at 400 degrees until marshmallows just start to ooze, 
about 10 minutes. Serve warm. Makes 4 S'Mores. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving, without chocolate chips, contains about: 253 calories; 202 mg 
sodium; trace cholesterol; 3 grams fat; 57 grams carbohydrates; 3 grams 
protein; 0.6 gram fiber.

CAN USDA BIRD BATH CLEAN UP POULTRY PROBLEMS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All visible fecal contamination must be removed from chicken carcasses before 
the birds can be released from processing plants and sold to consumers, 
according to a preliminary proposal announced last week by the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, poultry plants are allowed to either cut away any visible fecal 
matter on birds or send them to a large tank for rinsing in a 
5-parts-per-million solution of chlorine in water. In the industry this tank is 
known as the chiller tank. But critics have dubbed the tank "fecal soup" 
because contaminated birds are mingled with those without visible 
contamination, potentially spreading bacteria throughout the whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Fecal matter on chicken skin or flesh is an indicator of contamination. It can 
occur after mechanical evisceration, or when the chicken's intestines are 
removed, a step that may rupture organs or viscera. But it's not the only 
microbiological threat present in processing plants. Some harmful bacteria 
known to infect chickens -- such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Listeria -- 
are not necessarily transmitted by fecal material and cannot be detected by 
touch, smell or vision. For this reason, USDA is also requiring that all 
chicken plants conduct microbiological testing of their products to determine 
the extent, if any, of bacterial contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed fecal clean-up regulation, known as "zero tolerance," was on the 
books and enforced until the mid-'70s, when most evisceration was still done by 
hand. In 1978, processors were given the option of trimming, washing or 
vacuuming fecal matter from birds as long as the procedure was USDA-approved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until last year -- after the food poisoning outbreak linked to 
undercooked, contaminated hamburger -- that Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy 
directed federal inspectors in beef processing plants to enforce a previously 
unenforced "zero tolerance" rule for fecal matter on meat. Chicken processors 
lived with the more beneficial 1978 regulation until last week's developments. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA officials have been quick to point out that meat and poultry are being 
treated differently only because a "zero tolerance" regulation was already in 
place for beef but not for chicken. To apply the concept equally, USDA must go 
through the lengthy process of changing federal regulations that apply to 
chicken and overturning the more lenient 1978 regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 With beef, it was just a matter of sending out a directive to inspectors to 
tightly enforce the zero-tolerance rule that was already within USDA's 
authority.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, Secretary Espy said that federal inspectors will have the 
authority to send birds with visible fecal contamination back for a separate 
washing, or "reprocessing," prior to the chiller tank. Each carcass that is 
rewashed will also be reinspected by USDA to determine whether the extra rinse 
was effective in removing the fecal matter. If not, the bird is condemned and 
removed from the production line. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics claim that rewashing birds that contain visible fecal matter is not 
"zero tolerance" but a technique that gives chicken processors a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Numerous studies conclude that bacteria, once on the surface, are impossible 
to remove," said Rod Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition 
Institute, a Washington-based advocacy group. "USDA inspectors will now be 
checking for how the washing is working rather than inspecting for whether the 
birds are wholesome. I guess USDA will send all the inspectors to washing 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard's group, which is a member of the Safe Food Coalition, is saying that 
a zero-tolerance standard should be applied to the chicken industry and that 
any bird with visible fecal contamination should be condemned, not rewashed a 
second time in the hopes of removing the matter. He estimates that between 4% 
and 5% of all carcasses coming off high-speed poultry processing lines have 
visible evidence of feces because of evisceration problems. Losing so many 
birds to condemnation would obviously be costly for the industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone with a brain knows that consumers don't want food that has been 
exposed to fecal matter," Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mary Dixon, USDA spokeswoman in Washington, argues that the proposal does not 
give chicken processors a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only if the USDA inspector feels that washing can be effective in removing 
fecal matter will he or she then allow the rewashing," she said. "That also 
means that every bird will be rechecked after the rewashing. . . . We are 
making the poultry inspection system more stringent and adding a new inspector 
on the line. We are proposing to reinspect every bird that is spotted with 
contamination and reprocessed. We are not doing that now and it is clearly an 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 This second rinsing, while a major change for the poultry industry, was not 
made an option for the beef industry when zero tolerance was enforced last 
year. Unlike chicken plants, beef processors must trim any visible fecal matter 
and are not given the option of rewashing a problematic beef carcass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beef does not get rerinsing and that's unfair," said Rosemary Mucklow, 
executive director of the Western States Meat Assn., an Oakland-based trade 
group that includes poultry processors among its members. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another inequity, she points out, is that the poultry industry will have a 
long lead time to implement the current proposal, which must first go through a 
90-day comment period and then another 60 to 90 days before the final 
regulation takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zero tolerance is something that we lived with very specifically and 
immediately in the last year," Mucklow said. "The zero tolerance on the poultry 
side is sure going to tighten things up but still will be some time (up to six 
months) before it takes effect."

WINE: HAILING A CAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've toyed with the idea of starting a wine cellar, you might want to 
start soon. The current vintages of California Cabernet Sauvignons are among 
the best I have tasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you get a taste of some of the best recent Cabernet Sauvignons from 
California's north coast regions, it's difficult to avoid buying a few bottles 
and stashing them away for a few years.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the moderate heat and lack of rain at harvest time, 1990 and 1991 
produced some terrific wines. Some believe that 1985 and 1987 were better, but 
the voluptuous 1990s and the deep, classic 1991s are my favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, carefully selected 1989s (an improperly maligned vintage) can be 
great values. 
</P>
<P>
 The most remarkable thing about the 1990 and 1991 wines is the amount of fruit 
they contain; this means that if you age the wines five to 10 years, there 
still will be fruit left when you drink them. By then, much of the astringency 
will have gone, making the wine smoother and less gritty on the palate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the texture of these wines already is so appealing there is a 
temptation to drink them now. 
</P>
<P>
 I have tasted a wide range of 1990 and 1991 Cabernets in the past two months 
and find the 1990s drinkable now, with plenty of room for improvement in the 
bottle. The '91s are deeper and loaded with concentrated fruit, but almost all 
need more time in the bottle to smooth out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting thing occurred after my blind tastings. Normally, I leave most 
of the bottles on a counter for another day or so to see if the aeration helps 
or hurts the wines. Usually, about half the wines of any group begin to oxidize 
after a day, a few are about the same, and a couple are actually improved. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the 1991 Cabernets, almost all the wines were better after 
being open a day on the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't proof, but a strong indication that the wines are built to age. 
This has occurred, I think, because in most regions, the grapes in 1991 were 
harvested more than a month later than usual, meaning they had marvelous 
vine-ripened flavors and could be bottled without any of the manipulations that 
winemakers occasionally use to extract flavor from less-mature fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The following wines, which are listed in no particular order, are all 
exceptional. 1989 CABERNETS 
</P>
<P>
 Shafer Vineyards "Hillside Select" ($35) -- Rich, dark fruit, concentrated 
blackberry/cassis and mint aromas and a dense, tart finish. Anyone who thinks 
1989 produced wimpy wines should try this one. Seen discounted as low as 
$23.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Iron Horse Vineyards and Winery ($14) -- Marvelously aromatic wine with hints 
of tarragon and cherry mixed with a black-cherry note. The winery recently 
reduced the price of this wine because of negative comments by some people 
about the 1989 vintage. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Pepi Winery "Vine Hill" ($18) -- Herbal, green pepper hints add 
complexity to a black-cherry and anise aroma. Though the flavor lacked a bit of 
fruit, the next day the wine showed well. 1990 CABERNETS 
</P>
<P>
 Spottswoode Winery ($36) -- Deep black-cherry fruit with nuances of cedar and 
a great, powerful finish that is so tasty you'll want to drink it now. An 
excellent wine that's nearly sold out. Even better is the amazingly complex and 
complete 1991 version, which will be released about Sept. 1. Place your orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Liparita Winery ($28) -- Deep fruit and dense, chewy flavors, fairly tannic, 
but with the stuffing to age well. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Phelps Vineyards "Backus" ($30) -- Very concentrated black cherry and 
mint, dense color and almost overwhelming extract, yet with enough grace that 
it's nice to drink now. Another powerful Backus Cabernet. 
</P>
<P>
 Beringer Vineyards "Private Reserve" ($35) -- Another powerhouse wine from Ed 
Sbragia. Deep, dense cassis aromas, spiced-mint and chocolate tastes. A massive 
wine with a long track record of aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Domaine Michel ($12) -- Herbal-cherry notes, plenty of oak, lots of fruit, but 
a little one-dimensional. Needs two more years to smooth out, but a good value. 
</P>
<P>
 Mount Veeder Winery ($16) -- Herbal notes dominate the initial aroma, but 
there's good fruit and structure here. It tasted best the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Husch Winery "North Field Select" ($18) -- Minty/cherry aroma and a deep fruit 
taste. A wine for the short term, but with great flavors. 1991 CABERNETS 
</P>
<P>
 Staglin Family Vineyard ($26) -- Slightly more herbal than the marvelously 
currant-like 1990 Staglin, this wine offers more complex flavors and more 
depth. Stunning wine for the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Frog's Leap Vineyards ($17) -- Intense dark fruit aromas and flavors, nuances 
of herbs, and a luscious, very complex finish. As great a wine as Frog's Leap's 
amazing 1987, and a bargain. (Approximately 7,000 cases were produced and it 
was just released.) 
</P>
<P>
 Silverado Vineyards ($17) -- Racy cherry and herb elements are closed in when 
the cork is first pulled, but a bit of air opens the wine to reveal wonderful 
depth and a graceful texture. Nearly sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 Clos du Bois ($12.75) -- Fairly smoky/oaky aroma still offers a load of fine 
fruit and ample depth for a wine so reasonably priced. Probably not very 
long-lived, but marvelous flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockwood Winery, Monterey ($14) -- Earthy, faintly green-leafy aroma with good 
cherry-like fruit and enough richness to drink now; excellent aging potential.

THE STYLE FILES: THE PRICES; THE 10 ESSENTIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smart women stock their closets and beauty arsenals with certain basics. Those 
with a fairy godmother and a bottomless bank account can go into any luxury 
store in town and find indispensables that last a lifetime. But those with bank 
accounts teetering on tilt need durable basics that are dirt-cheap, but don't 
look it. Here are the cheapest basics we'd be caught dead in -- and their 
upscale counterparts. Take your pick. A classic is a classic, after all. The 
final tally, not including taxes or manicurist tips: $10,340 for the high end, 
$193.70 for the low. CLASSIC BLACK PUMPS 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Jourdan is world-famous for high-heeled pumps. Each pump is made by 30 
craftsmen at the French workshop in which Jourdan started his business in 1921. 
The supple Nappa leather from Mediterranean lambs is finished with bees wax to 
preserve the shine. The cost: $195 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 When you need a plain little black pump, Standard Shoes does very nicely. Its 
$29.90 pump has a leather upper and the shape is retro classic. The downfall of 
cheap shoes (and some expensive ones) is the plastic heel tip. Replace it with 
a rubber one. A BASIC MANICURE 
</P>
<P>
 A West Hollywood manicure joint with a New York public relations consultant? 
Jessica's Nail Salon is more like the ultimate beauty salon for the hands. Just 
ask customers Nancy Reagan, Jamie Lee Curtis and Delta Burke. For $22 you get 
an individualized hour of mitts, balms, soaking, pampering and polishing. 
Founder Jessica Vartoughian pioneered the concept of a nails-only salon in 1969 
and has personally trained all of her manicurists, or "cultivists" as they are 
called here. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy's Nails on Melrose in West Hollywood is a 12-year-old family business 
headed by Kathy Bui, her four daughters and assorted cousins who came from 
Vietnam in 1975. This basic, friendly salon charges $7 for a half-hour 
manicure, and has a loyal following of models, women sent over by the couturier 
next door, and celebs -- including Anita Baker, Lisa Bonet, Winona Ryder and 
Katie Wagner. Years ago, Demi Moore even gave a manicures-for-everyone 
bachelorette party here. LEATHER HANDBAG 
</P>
<P>
 Hermes christened its Kelly bag when Grace Kelly bought these classic saddle 
bags in every color for her trousseau. She loved the black, shown here in a 
medium size for $3,295. Each bag is entirely handmade by just one well-paid 
Parisian craftsman from the finest calf leather and non-tarnishing, gold-plated 
fittings. Ask to see one, and salespeople put on white gloves to avoid 
(horrors!) a fingerprint on the leather. 
</P>
<P>
 Discount handbags are the true leftovers of the fashion world, featuring awful 
colors, scary patchwork designs and strange shapes you wouldn't carry in a dark 
alley. It makes sense to go to a department store during a sale and get some of 
the regular stock marked down. The Robinson's-May monthly "15-hour" sale is 
worth the wait because the purse department is not shy about slashing prices. 
This buy, a black leather clutch with shoulder strap, on sale for $22.50, was 
typical. PEARL EARRINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Golightly would tell you the ultimate classic pearl earrings come in a 
little turquoise box. Tiffany's 9.5-millimeter pearl stud earrings are a hefty 
$3,700 largely because it takes as long as seven years to culture pearls this 
big and they're in enormous demand. (Natural pearls? Forget it. The price jumps 
10 times higher.) Pearls are judged by six points: color, luster, nacre 
thickness, match, shape and surface smoothness. This pair is perfect on all 
counts, and the color is the most sought after -- cream with pink overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 From a distance, who can tell? Well, maybe from quite a distance. For $2.99, 
the price of a Big Mac and fries, you can get simulated pearl stud earrings at 
Marshall's. They're made out of God only knows what -- plastic? -- but they 
have a nice warm, pearly beige color with a bit of a sheen that makes them 
appear a lot more like real pearls than something found in a 5-year-old's 
dress-up box. TRENCH COAT 
</P>
<P>
 Burberry's trench coat is the only trench you'll need this lifetime. Its 
styling is timeless, yet new fabric technology makes it more comfortable than a 
conventional wool twill coat. This one's made of an advanced polyester and 
nylon blend that looks traditional, but is incredibly light and with suede-like 
softness to the touch. Zip out the warm liner to reveal that signature plaid 
fabric lining. At $700, it should be perfection. I. Magnin stocks them. 
</P>
<P>
 Luck and a swing through a discounter can net you a name brand trench. This 
one, $69.99 at Marshall's, has a department store label, and is an ivory cotton 
and polyester blend that will hold up respectably. It has a few pretty details, 
like ivory and brass-look buttons, a partial lining, capelet detail and a 
fold-down lapel in khaki-colored fabric. NAVY BLAZER 
</P>
<P>
 For the classic navy blazer of a lifetime, there's no place to go but Giorgio 
Armani. The master Milanese tailor has made jackets his signature and you'd 
probably have this black-label blazer forever. Its sleek, one-button styling is 
not extreme in any area: shoulder pads are medium, the body is neither too boxy 
nor too tight. The fine wool crepe wears incredibly well and shows wrinkles so 
minimally that it's ideal for travel. The jacket is $1,170.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not unusual these days to find used clothes in new-clothes stores. Some 
department and discount stores now offer recycled vintage men's blazers for 
their junior, funky, cash-strapped or more adventurous women customers. 
Generally, these are basic dark-colored jackets that have been cleaned and 
restored. The quality of the fabric is often surprisingly good. Shown here: one 
navy wool jacket from Clothestime's vintage rack for $22.99. BLACK LEGGINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to a swimwear designer to make the ultimate black leggings. Liza 
Bruce stitched these up from her thickest matte black nylon-and-spandex maillot 
fabric. Just like a swimsuit, a pair of Bruce's leggings smoothes out the 
jiggles, stays a nice true black through any amount of washing and gives 
terrific support. A big plus: the leggings don't bag at the knees. They're made 
in England and sold at Barneys New York, Shauna Stein and Theodore for around 
$165. 
</P>
<P>
 You might find specials in discount stores where leggings of varying quality 
are priced less, but it can be a bit of a gamble. Contempo Casual's house brand 
leggings have consistently decent quality and are a good buy at two for $24, or 
$14 if purchased singly. They're made in the U.S. of a good, dense black cotton 
and spandex. And they're long enough to reach the ankles and not ride up the 
calves. RED LIPSTICK 
</P>
<P>
 Aficionados all have their own candidate for the ultimate red lipstick. YSL's 
No. 6 and M.A.C.'s Russian Red (Madonna's favorite) are matte, pigment-rich 
lipsticks that have such incredible staying power they're more of a commitment 
than the average marriage. Those who like creamier lipsticks choose Mon Rouge 
by Paloma Picasso, or the ultimate classic, Chanel's Red Red, which is an 
exquisite, 1940s red that makes strong men weak. New technology gives the 
Chanel lipstick the advantage -- it has all-natural pigments, good staying 
power and moisturizing elements to keep lips from drying. The price: $19 a 
tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Revlon's reds are the Coca-Cola of red lipsticks. Its Fire & Ice, Love That 
Red and Cherries in the Snow have been in women's vanities since the early 
1950s, and deservedly so because they're solid reds and wear well. At $6.50, 
they're at the top end of drug store brands. Revlon uses a better quality wax, 
which is then blended with pigment three times, instead of just once, to give 
better consistency and smoothness. BLACK TURTLENECK 
</P>
<P>
 Valentino's $1,065 cashmere rib turtlenecks (or $1,095 in flat knit), made in 
Portofino on Italy's scenic Amalfi coast, might be the most shockingly 
expensive sweaters ever made, but they're staples in many affluent women's 
closets. One wardrobe guru describes this turtleneck as "the one everyone has" 
and "a forever sweater." Another points out that it's the perfect low-key 
luxury item for a woman who doesn't want to show off. The fitted body, high 
armhole, light two-ply weight and not-too-voluminous neck make it perfect under 
jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you won't have this one forever, but the Gap's black cotton turtleneck 
will look good several seasons. For $16.50, it's a respectable cotton with a 
nice soft hand and a good opaque color. If you follow the salesperson's advice, 
the color will stay dense and the top will keep its shape: wash in cold water, 
don't machine dry and try not to pull on the neck. WHITE CREW SOCKS 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Klein's crew socks ($9 a pair at Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bullock's) 
are made of luxurious Sea Island cotton, which, by virtue of its long staple 
fiber, is strong and as soft as cashmere. The anklets are treated so fungus 
never grows on them. Reactive dye guarantees they won't yellow. The best part 
is that these socks get softer as you wash them and hold up for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Saving money is a virtue too, and buying socks in bulk is very virtuous. At 
Woolworth, Hanes Her Way packaged crew socks are six pairs for $8, or $1.33 per 
pair. Ross Dress for Less also has good bulk prices on name-brand socks, such 
as the recent six pairs of Danskin anklets for $6.99, or $1.17 a pair. The 
Venice boardwalk outdoor stands, open on weekends, offer the ultimate deal: 
five pair of cotton/nylon athletic crew socks for $5, just $1 a pair.

THE STYLE FILES: THE PRICES; 'I'M NOT COUTURE'; THE PRICE MAY BE HAUTE, BUT 
DESIGNER JAMES GALANOS IS QUICK TO REMIND THAT HIS COLLECTIONS ARE 
READY-TO-WEAR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
</P>

<P>
 If there's any American designer who can be called a couturier, it's James 
Galanos. 
</P>
<P>
 From the early '50s, he has been turning out intricately designed and 
meticulously made day and evening wear to acclaim from the fashion press and 
from a select clientele who appreciates his unique vision and can afford his 
uncommonly high prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't call his collections couture within his earshot, because this 
modest-seeming but exacting man will set you straight. "I'm not couture, but I 
work like couture -- my training is that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always said we are ready-to-wear, but in the highest luxury level. Our 
clothes are made in the same manner that they're made in Paris." Couture should 
refer only to custom-fitted clothing, and, as Galanos points out, "I sell to 
the stores. Whatever alterations may have to be, have to be done by the 
alterations departments in the stores." 
</P>
<P>
 If his name is not as familiar to the general public as Yves Saint Laurent's 
nor as licensed as Bill Blass', that's the way he wants it. There is a perfume, 
and for about 10 years, a fur license, but that's all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't commercialize myself," he says. "I wasn't interested in mass 
production." 
</P>
<P>
 What he is interested in, now and as he was from the beginning, is making "the 
most elegant clothes for the most affluent women." He's obviously proud of his 
reputation, and of the fact that, at 69, he's outlasted many a contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanos knew what he wanted to do from an early age. He began sketching 
clothes at age 7, and three years later won first prize for a cheerleader's 
uniform in a New Jersey state competition. He apprenticed for a short time at 
the House of Piguet in Paris before returning to the United States in the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief stint at a New York ready-to-wear house, he came to Los Angeles 
and set up his own company, Galanos Originals, in 1951, with backing from Jean 
Louis, the head designer of Columbia studios. By 1953, at age 29, Galanos had 
established his reputation for complex, imaginative designs and fine 
workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year brought a Coty Award, the first of what would be a string of 
such honors. Then in 1985, the Council of Fashion Designers of America gave him 
its lifetime achievement award. His work has also been the subject of 
retrospectives at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (in 1974) and the 
Fashion Institute of Technology in New York (1976). 
</P>
<P>
 Galanos is known best for fanciful beaded work -- such as the floral design on 
the one-shoulder, white satin gown he created for Nancy Reagan to wear to the 
1981 inaugural -- and a fearless way with chiffon. He also likes juxtaposing 
unusual materials -- wool and satin, say, or corduroy and chiffon. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Galanos dress or gown is produced in the designer's West L.A. workrooms, 
where he employs a staff of 65 cutters, tailors and pressers, many of whom have 
been with him since the '50s. There are no design assistants -- he does all 
that himself, sketching or draping each model. 
</P>
<P>
 And as one might expect with such materials and finishing, his clothes are 
extremely expensive -- prices start around $4,000 and go up, sometimes way up, 
from there.  
</P>
<P>
 Galanos produces two collections a year, each consisting of 120 to 200 models, 
that are shown to buyers and clients in New York, Palm Beach, Chicago, Dallas, 
Houston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. He rarely does custom work now, and he 
gave up fashion shows in the mid-'80s, preferring more intimate methods of 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Galanos has adapted. "I've kept up with the times," he says. 
"I've paid attention to what's happening in the fashion world, with the 
contemporary feeling of that moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, some dresses in his spring '94 collection are as short as 
anything you'll see in Paris or on Seventh Avenue. But that's as far as he'll 
bend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never downgraded what I've done as far as quality and workmanship and 
what I stand for," he declares. Nor, goes the unspoken implication, would he 
ever.

THE STYLE FILES: THE PRICES; ON THE DISCOUNT TRAIL; A TRIP TO THE HUSH-HUSH 
WORLD OF HUGE MARKDOWNS

 How does a $235 Ralph Lauren anorak end up selling for $49.99 at Ross Dress 
for Less? 
</P>
<P>
 When a savvy girlfriend nabbed this candied-violet bargain in the men's 
department at the Westwood store, I thought I'd try to locate one of my own. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided to do some detective work to uncover its roots. In so doing, I hoped 
to uncover the secrets of discount shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shoppers know that a portion of the merchandise in most off-price stores 
is from previous seasons. This was clearly the case here: The sleeve on this 
Lauren jacket read Polo 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 I stopped into my area Ross store but didn't see any of the jacket's siblings. 
Perhaps if I called the Ross Stores New Jersey headquarters, I could locate a 
similar jacket. Where does Ross get its supply of Lauren jackets? I ask a 
headquarters spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly she demurs. Like a magician's tricks, the store's sources are 
never revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 I begin to suspect that a 007-spy-style London Fog trench would be better 
suited for my investigative pursuits. But, no way. I've come too far with the 
cotton anorak to settle for anything less. 
</P>
<P>
 Next I phone Ralph Lauren's Polo store in South Coast Plaza. A polite salesman 
answers the phone in the men's department. I ask him if he has any of the 
jackets with 1992 left on them. He laughs hysterically. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his salesman personality kicks in. "Are you looking for a lightweight 
jacket?" he asks. "We have several in stock right now." 
</P>
<P>
 I visit the store and check them out. They're all well over $100 -- not quite 
the bargain I demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Time to go to the top. I call Ralph Lauren (not personally, of course). A 
spokeswoman listens politely to my queries: Where did these particular anoraks 
go? What off-price stores such as Ross Dress For Less might have them? Would 
any of the Ralph Lauren outlet stores have them?  
</P>
<P>
 Someone will get back to me, she says assuringly. I'm still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Elyse Lazar, New York-based publisher of the S&B Report -- the bible 
for designer showroom sales and bargains -- might have the skinny on journeys 
the jacket and other such items take from designer to discount stores.  
</P>
<P>
 "Designers do not like to talk about it," says Lazar, "and stores do not want 
to reveal their sources." 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 "But usually, a designer like Ralph will be left with, say, 10,000 jackets. A 
store like Ross may take all or half or 10% of them. Usually this is done no 
earlier than the end of a season, so as not to irritate the designer's 
department and specialty store accounts."  
</P>
<P>
 And in recent years, Lauren and other designers have opened their own outlet 
stores, the better to profit from leftover stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Aha! Maybe Lauren's outlet store in Barstow still has the jacket of my dreams. 
I phone the shop, where the receptionist transfers me to the men's department. 
The polite salesman searches in vain for the coveted anorak. "Sorry," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so I wasn't going to find another jacket like my friend's. Nor would I 
uncover the jacket's trek from Lauren's New York design studios to the crowded 
racks at Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps it was just as well. During a recent tactile encounter with the 
item, some of the dye came off in my hand, rendering it far less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, I realized, it didn't matter. Just as there are many fish in the 
sea, there are many bargains in the ocean of off-price shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The candied-violet anorak was gone, but over at Ross I found an Asics nylon 
jacket with lavendar insets for $19.99, down from $90. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery, it seems, is more than half the joy of bargain hunting.

 Dueling Quakes: It could happen, if the students at Cal State Northridge vote 
to change the school's nickname to commemorate the 6.8 shaker. The Rancho 
Cucamonga Quakes baseball team says the region ain't big enough for them and 
the Northridge Quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're 70 miles away (from Northridge)," said Greg Scharlach, a spokesman for 
the San Bernardino County minor league team. "Our lawyers tell us that because 
of the close proximity there is legal ground for us to take action. We have 
trademarked the names Quake and Epicenter (their stadium)." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute could be academic, so to speak, if Northridge's Student Senate 
votes not to place the name-change issue on the ballot. The school's teams are 
now called the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's Paul Bubb, an associate athletic director, questioned Rancho 
Cucamonga's exclusive rights to a name. "Fresno State is the Bulldogs; Drake 
(University) is the Bulldogs," he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rancho Cucamonga's Scharlach noted, with some irritation: "We hear 
they (Northridge) have already put up a banner that says Epicenter inside their 
gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the banner has been removed from the gym. It's now being used by the 
school's softball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubb says there are no current plans to paint a fault-line on the gym floor, 
as one athlete suggested. "But it could be an interesting intimidation factor 
against opponents," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The grammar wasn't worth a plugged nickel: Bill DeBussey bought a toy at one 
of those everything-under-$1 stores and found the directions even more 
confusing than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The winner, truly: Showing that bad writing is not limited to one sex, Bernice 
Richmond became the first woman to win the annual International Imitation 
Hemingway Competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short and sweet and wonderfully clever," one judge, Ray Bradbury, said of 
"Here's to You," the title of Richmond's submission. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps her most moving passage reads: "Then she smiled. She did not have to 
smile. She did not have to lick her lips with that tongue, the kind that would 
not quit. What was she trying to do? Was this her way of being coy at 1 a.m., 
or was there a poppy seed caught in her teeth?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Big Too-Hardened Liver": That's the title of our all-time favorite piece of 
ersatz Hemingway, which was penned by Ken Bash a couple of years ago -- and set 
in romantic Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was early morning," Bash rhapsodized, "and the sun was bright and painful 
and rising on the tall glass towers when the rocket exploded to announce the 
release of the bulls and we all rushed out to see the big, brave, mature and 
viciously horny bulls toss the TV executives as they came up the escalators." 
</P>
<P>
 It just doesn't get any worse than that. LAny: 
</P>
<P>
 We noticed in a press release from USC spokeswoman Zsa Zsa Gershick that the 
school's College of Letters, Arts and Sciences now has a Streisand 
Professorship in Intimacy and Sexuality. Yes, that Streisand.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: GROUP SHOULDN'T SNICKER AT PERSON'S PAIN; WHEN DISASTERS 
OCCUR, GOOD SAMARITANS STEP FORTH. BUT INDIVIDUALS IN DISTRESS NEED HELP TOO.

 One morning, I waited in a group at Kinko's when someone shouted, "She's not 
wearing a stitch." We looked out and saw a naked woman with tangled, blond hair 
hanging past her shoulders walking north on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The group snickered, and I twice yelled, "Call 911." The man behind the 
counter ignored my directions, saying, "Someone will." An elderly female 
customer making copies snorted contemptuously at the woman drifting down the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Good Samaritans abounded as L.A. dealt with its crisis. The 
earthquake challenged the whole population because many were affected. When 
conditions threatened survivors, everyday saints came out of corners to save 
lives and offer shelter, water, food, clothing and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 In those rumbling 20 seconds, a new community formed in which norms were reset 
and social boundaries expanded and adjusted. There were shared risks and new 
heroes who met our needs, as life's price anted up during this emergency. The 
need for community action and service was widespread. Perhaps, many discovered 
goodness they hadn't realized before.  
</P>
<P>
 A group can behave differently, though, when the crisis belongs to an 
individual. 
</P>
<P>
 When one suffers, we stare amazed, and consider personal safety or liability 
when involvement comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 We may feel compassion while wondering what the individual did to deserve 
misfortune. "How terrible," we think, or "Better you than me." The other guy's 
problem is still the other guy's, or maybe it's a trick. These days, who can be 
blamed for such caution? We hesitate, paralysis results, then shame may follow 
-- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, I stood with the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 They reacted callously to the naked lady, and feeling numb, I apparently 
feared separating from them. She was in trouble; yet instead of showing 
sensitivity, a few were disgusted, most were amused, and one felt numb. 
</P>
<P>
 On a daily basis, is our culture, finally, too Beavis-and-Butt-Head-ized? Is 
helping only the purview of public disasters? Some say laughter is a nervous 
reaction, but laughter at suffering should never be accepted without question. 
</P>
<P>
 A group can be evil's vehicle. Unfortunately, I experienced bystander 
passivity, and it may be evil's way into the human spirit. If the individual 
perceives evil, fear of the group's response prevents the individual from 
taking right action. Underneath "bystanderism" lies the dread -- what if they 
laugh at me, too, or worse? More awful are degrees of bystanderism, and 
believing passive participation in another's humiliation is natural -- like the 
child shouting "Goodby, Jews" in "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 As a group member, the individual displays group principles, regardless of 
personal beliefs. In "A Boy's Life," Tobias Wolff writes, " . . . any image of 
myself, no matter how grotesque, had power over me." Many individuals are 
subject to powerful personal images as group members. Isn't that ironic?  
</P>
<P>
 True, the tendency to group helps some manifest good; shared disaster and most 
religious groups can strengthen people for good, and 12-step, self-help groups 
(surely an oxymoron) can provide valuable blueprints for living. Yet the 
question remains, why do groups formed around evil get such a hold over 
individuals? 
</P>
<P>
 Many times, I've relived that morning at Kinko's, fantasized rushing out, 
pulling the blanket from my car and wrapping the naked woman in it. Truth is, I 
stood with this snickering, instantly formed group of clothed adults and let 
the naked woman drift past. I drove off to teach an English class at a local 
college. I told them what happened, and one student asked why I didn't help. I 
had no answer, just shame. 
</P>
<P>
 I no longer believe a Good Samaritan will pop up if something bad happens, 
because most bystanders laugh, tsk their tongues, freeze, or look the other 
way. We're losing to our fears. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman walked another block before a dry cleaner's employee rescued her and 
called the police. Turns out, she'd been beaten by her boyfriend who then threw 
her naked into the street. Thankfully someone eventually helped her, but God 
help the ones who stood by -- and stand by when evil acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgive me, Naked Stranger. That morning you passed by earth-shaken, beaten, 
and disguised in nakedness, while I froze between knowledge and fear. Next 
time, I won't. I can't.

VALLEY PERSPECTIVE; GIVE THEM A CHANCE, AND A SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subject of day laborers inspires angry feelings and loud debate. That has 
been the case recently in Ladera Heights, north of Inglewood, where residents 
sought to ban gatherings of the job seekers. Now, fortunately, County 
Supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke and her colleagues have withdrawn a plan 
that would have banned curbside job solicitation in some commercial parking 
lots and near homes, schools, playgrounds and churches in unincorporated parts 
of Los Angeles County, Ladera Heights among them. She has come up with a much 
better idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke's alternative -- supported by all except Supervisor Gloria Molina -- 
allows laborers to seek work on the sidewalks where they usually congregate; 
however, in commercial parking lots, where merchants sometimes object to the 
laborers' presence, they could be barred from most of the space if owners put 
aside a spot where people could look for work and post signs against the 
activity elsewhere. Laborers caught violating the restrictions would get up to 
six months in jail and be fined as such as $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This ordinance is not the final word on day labor, but it is preferable to the 
earlier measure. However, we think that local government is best engaged in 
this issue when it goes even further and helps to choose central hiring 
locations. That's better than having contractors cruising streets looking for 
workers, and preferable to job seekers scattered hither and yon, in potentially 
disruptive fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. City Councilman Joel Wachs has been considering the centralized approach 
at a site in Van Nuys. Council member Laura Chick has entertained the same idea 
for her district. Laguna Beach has operated an outdoor hiring site in an 
industrial area on Laguna Canyon Road for several years. A more comprehensive 
approach can be found in Orange, Brea and Costa Mesa, where hiring halls also 
offer English classes and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Such approaches minimize the potentially negative impact of crowds forming in 
scattered locations, and they also acknowledge that the laborers often are 
performing brutally menial -- although vitally needed -- tasks at the lowest of 
wages, jobs that not many people want.

 Of all the 64 teams in the NCAA tournament, one of the most surprised to be 
there is the College of Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who jumped from NAIA to Division I only three years ago, were 
such longshots that coach John Kresse suggested to his players they not show up 
at the restaurant where he was watching the NCAA selection show with fans 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'We need not have you at a gathering where if you don't see your 
name pop up, it would be a major bummer,' " Kresse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kresse had solicited the help of Lou Carnesecca, his former boss at 
St. John's, in trying to secure a place for Charleston in the National 
Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had never looked at the little guy for an at-large bid" in the NCAA, 
Kresse said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Cougars were selected as an at-large NCAA entry, Kresse said, "I was 
flabbergasted," and the players began celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, the Cougars (24-3), who were seeded 12th in the Southeast 
Regional, began practicing for their first-round game against No. 5 seed Wake 
Forest (20-11) at Lexington, Ky., today. 
</P>
<P>
 That game will be the opener of a quadrupleheader at Rupp Arena. It will be 
followed by Kansas (25-7), the No. 4 seed, against 13th-seeded 
Tennessee-Chattanooga (23-6); Purdue (26-4), the No. 1 seed, against Central 
Florida (21-8), seeded 16th, and eighth-seeded Providence (20-9) against 
Alabama (19-9), the No. 9 seed. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Regional begins Thursday at Uniondale, N.Y., with Connecticut (27-4), 
the No. 2 seed, against 15th-seeded Rider (21-8); Alabama-Birmingham (22-7), 
seeded seventh, against No. 10 seed George Washington (17-11); Nebraska (20-9), 
seeded sixth, against Penn (24-2), the No. 11 seed, and Florida (25-7), seeded 
third, against James Madison (20-9), seeded 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 First-round games in the Midwest Regional will be played at Wichita, Kan., 
Thursday, with Saint Louis (23-5), the No. 7 seed, against Maryland (16-11), 
the No. 10 seed; Massachusetts (27-6), seeded second, vs. Southwest Texas State 
(25-6), seeded 15th; Michigan (21-7), seeded third, against Pepperdine (19-10), 
the No. 14 seed, and Texas (25-7), seeded sixth, vs. Western Kentucky (20-10), 
seeded 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 And the West Regional starts Thursday at Ogden, Utah, with Syracuse (21-6) 
against Hawaii (18-14), seeded 13th; California (22-7), seeded fifth, vs. 
Wisconsin-Green Bay (26-6), seeded 12th; Missouri (25-3), the No. 1 seed, 
against Navy (17-12), seeded 16th, and Cincinnati (22-9), seeded eighth, vs. 
Wisconsin (17-10), seeded ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 16 opening-round games will be played Friday, with the East 
Regional at Landover, Md., the Southeast at St. Petersburg, Fla., the Midwest 
at Oklahoma City, and the West at Sacramento, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Charleston, the 1983 NAIA champion, was able to overcome its small-time 
reputation this season with victories over Penn State, Alabama and 
UNC-Charlotte. The Cougars also own the nation's longest winning streak at 16 
and have a 364-98 record in Kresse's 15 years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 They are one of the nation's best defensive teams, holding opponents to a 
field goal percentage of 38.9. 
</P>
<P>
 While Charleston is making its first appearance in the NCAA tournament, its 
first-round opponent, Wake Forest, is making its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Randolph Childress, the Demon Deacons' leader, said, "This is probably the 
least talented team we've had since I've been here." But he added, "In my 
opinion, this is the best team we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 The closely-knit Demon Deacons beat Duke twice and North Carolina once late in 
the season and finished third in the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's getting more and more like I am," Childress said. "We just expect 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other tournament longshots are Southwest Texas State and Wisconsin-Green 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Texas State, which never had won a game in the Southland Conference 
tournament in four previous tries, won the championship this season, beating 
North Texas 69-60. Only two years ago, the Bobcats had finished with a 7-20 
record. Last year, they were 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are used to not playing in front of a big crowd," Bobcats point guard 
Russell Ponds said. "It will be a shocker to see a lot of people at the UMass 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Respect is one thing we lack. We lead our conference in a number of 
categories, and no one still has any respect for us." 
</P>
<P>
 An exception is Massachusetts coach John Calipari. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've won 10 in a row and 19 of their last 20," Calipari said of the 
Bobcats. "This is the type of team that scares me. There has got to be another 
15 seed in the country we could play." 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin-Green Bay coach Dick Bennett doesn't think his team gets enough 
respect, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we strike fear in anybody's heart, nor should we," he said. 
"This is NCAA basketball. I would be very surprised if they overlook us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenix, making its fifth straight postseason appearance and second in 
three years in the NCAA tournament, beat Marquette, North Carolina State and 
Oregon this season, while losing to Wake Forest by three points in overtime and 
to Purdue by five.

TIM BROWN STILL A RAIDER; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER SHOPPING AROUND, TEAM DECIDES TO 
MATCH OFFER FROM DENVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders ensured that they will keep Tim Brown by matching the four-year, 
$11 million the Pro Bowl wide receiver received from the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders announced their decision Wednesday, two days before their deadline 
to match the offer or lose Brown, who won the 1987 Heisman Trophy as college 
football's top player after his senior year at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a tough decision," said Steve Ortmayer, the Raiders' director of 
football operations. "The problem for a club is when you have a decision like 
this, and you have outstanding young players at the same position on your team. 
You have to look to see who else is out there that can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "While there's some outstanding value out there in the unrestricted free-agent 
market, there was no one we felt who had the value of a Tim Brown for this 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon hearing the Raiders' decision, Brown didn't sound upset at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard not to be happy, let's be honest here," he said. "I was trying to 
get the best deal I could get for myself. The bottom line is this is the 
business part of football. Now, it's time to go play football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that this team, with me, of course, will be challenging for the 
Super Bowl next season. It's a good situation. I'm a little stunned that it 
happened so quickly, I wasn't expecting to hear until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been home for me for six years, that's not going to be anything 
different now. It's a matter of going out and playing football." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver Coach Wade Phillips seemed unperturbed by the Raiders' action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a loss. It was kind of a hopeful thing on our part. We extended 
ourselves as much as we could, and they (the Raiders) extended themselves and 
signed him," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy for Tim Brown that he basically gets his money. I'm not happy for 
the Raiders that they got him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown caught 80 passes, a franchise record for the wide receiver, gained an 
AFC-leading 1,180 yards receiving and scored seven touchdowns in 1993. He also 
averaged 11.6 yards in punt returns, including one return for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said when he signed the Broncos' offer sheet that he wanted to play 
there. As part of the contract, there is a no-trade clause that Brown and the 
Broncos both believed would make it more difficult for the Raiders to match. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a hard salary cap system in this age," Ortmayer said. "Whether we 
signed Tim Brown or not, there are certain players on our team who will have to 
take drastic salary cuts or be released." 
</P>
<P>
 Ortmayer would not say who those players might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders, more than anyone, believe strongly in continuity, history and 
tradition," Ortmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a first-round draft choice, sixth overall in 1988, was an immediate 
star with the Raiders as a rookie, leading the team with 43 receptions although 
he was not a starter -- and making the Pro Bowl as a kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown missed all but the first game of the 1989 season due to a knee injury. 
His yardage in pass receptions and punt returns increased each year since then.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PIAZZA SHIES FROM ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Piazza put in a full day's work in only five innings Wednesday against 
the Atlanta Braves, hitting a home run and sacrifice fly and throwing out a 
runner attempting to steal, before turning the catching gear over to Carlos 
Hernandez. But the game was far from over, lasting 3 hours and 48 minutes 
before Mike Sharperson's single in the 12th inning gave the Dodgers an 8-7 
victory at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Piazza was gone, having first signed autographs for about an hour 
outside the Dodgertown clubhouse. Four weeks into spring training, Piazza is 
still doing his best to accommodate the fans, but he says sometimes the 
attention makes him edgy, and he thinks he understands why. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to watch all sports -- I just don't get into the stats and all," he 
said. "And that's what is difficult for me sometimes now, with all the 
attention that I'm getting.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid, I just used to watch players and see how they carried 
themselves. I was embarrassed to ask them for a broken bat, or for their 
autograph. I used to go to the Phillies' games and watch everything Mike 
Schmidt used to do, how he fixed his hair, his hat, how he adjusted his 
sunglasses. I aspired to be how he was. He wasn't flashy, he just did his job 
and was one of the greatest third baseman ever. Then, when I played third base 
in Little League, I tried to be just like him." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza said he got to meet Schmidt once when he was a batboy for the Dodgers. 
"I shook his hand and didn't say a word because I didn't want him to fluff me 
off," Piazza said. "That's the reason that, for me, it's kind of tough with 
everybody always wanting something from me all the time. I read a story the 
other day that said I just wanted to be left alone, but that's not true. I 
enjoy the people, but sometimes there are just a few bad eggs that ruin it for 
everybody. They don't understand I have to get my work done first. That is what 
brought me to this position anyway. But I'm doing my best." MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; TRADE TALK SURPRISES SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First baseman J.T. Snow said he was surprised when he heard that he might be 
involved in a trade for New York Met pitcher Anthony Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely a bit of a shock," he said, "but it's one of those things 
that you have no control over, so I'm trying not to dwell on it, especially 
until something actually happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow said he would like to be an Angel long enough to show the team he's 
capable of becoming a consistent force at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to keep playing here -- I grew up in the area -- but I'd prefer 
to reserve my true feelings until something happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers, perhaps laying the groundwork for the reasoning 
behind a trade, said the jury is still out on Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone agrees that he's still one hell of a prospect, but he's 
still in the prospect range," Rodgers said. "This is an endurance contest and 
you have to have a strong will to make it through." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Harrison, special assistant to the general manager, said the deal was "not 
cut and dried," but seemed to indicate it was a strong possibility. The Angels 
believe Young is much better than his 1-16 record of last season. JOHN WEYLER

<P>
 The makers of Roadkill Helper have agreed to pull the joke item and other 
Hamburger Helper parodies, settling a lawsuit brought by General Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado-based Gag Foods, which also makes Spotted Owl Helper, agreed to stop 
selling the items by the end of the year, said Kevin Callaghan of Callaghan 
Promotions in Birmingham. Callaghan distributes the products. 
</P>
<P>
 General Mills spokeswoman Pam Becker said the company tried to negotiate with 
Gag Foods and Callaghan Promotions for two years before filing the suit in

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: FOR THE NEWLY INTRODUCED POWER MACS, IT'S NO 
CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They look like Macs, they feel like Macs and they run Macintosh software. But 
they're not ordinary Macs. 
</P>
<P>
 The three new Power Macintosh machines that went on sale Monday represent 
Apple's most significant advance since the introduction of the original Mac 10 
years ago. On the surface, they don't seem that much different. The hardware 
looks just like Apple's existing Quadra line, and the operating system and 
application programs look and behave just as they do on other Macs. But lurking 
inside these rather ordinary-looking machines is a very powerful new chip. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Macs are the first personal computers to use the PowerPC 
microprocessors, developed jointly by Apple, IBM and Motorola. IBM has released 
a $10,000 Unix workstation with a PowerPC chip, but it is not designed to 
compete with today's desktop PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Macs, with a starting price of about $2,100, including keyboard and 
monitor, are aimed directly at the desktops of current Macintosh and 
IBM-compatible PC users. 
</P>
<P>
 The PowerPC chip, which uses RISC (reduced instruction set computing) 
technology, doesn't require nearly as many internal instructions or codes as 
equally powerful central processing units, such as the Intel chips used in 
IBM-compatible PCs. Because they require fewer internal instructions, they are 
smaller, more energy-efficient and less expensive than the current generation 
of Intel Pentium processors used in today's fastest IBM-compatible PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new machines can run programs from two to five times faster than previous 
Macintosh CPUs, but to get that extra speed, the programs have to be written or 
modified to support the new chip. Existing Macintosh software will run on the 
Power Macs, but at about the same speed as on Mac Quadra. Some programs, in 
fact, will run slower on a Power Mac, according to Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects more than 50 Power Mac-ready applications within a month, 
and more than 150 software developers have announced plans to create Power Mac 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For some users -- including those of us who use our computers mostly for 
writing, telecommunications and basic number crunching -- this extra speed will 
have little significance. Today's high-end Macs and PCs are already fast. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who do design work, manipulate complex graphics, engage in 
scientific modeling or publishing of large documents, the extra performance can 
have a big impact on how long it takes to get through a day's work. Over time, 
new generations of computers often serve as catalysts for new types of software 
as programmers learn to exploit the power of the new machines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Power Macs are also capable of running DOS and Windows programs, but that 
requires a copy of SoftWindows, a program that lets a Mac emulate an 
IBM-compatible PC. With SoftWindows, most Windows programs on a Power Mac will 
operate at about the same speed as on a 386 PC, although some will approach the 
performance of a low-end 486. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, that's mediocre performance by today's standards, so it would be 
foolish to buy a Power Mac just to run DOS or Windows. You can buy a 
high-performance 486 PC or even an ultra-fast Pentium PC for less than the cost 
of a Power Mac. All Power Macs can read and write IBM-compatible diskettes, and 
many Mac programs can use the same data files as comparable Windows programs. 
Apple includes a copy of SoftWindows only on machines with at least 16 
megabytes of RAM -- the minimum needed for the machine to properly run Windows 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple hopes its Power Macs will lure would-be buyers of IBM-compatible 
machines. They're definitely worth considering, but if you buy a Mac, do it 
because you want to run Macintosh programs, not because it can emulate a PC. 
</P>
<P>
 All three new models come with 8 megabytes of RAM, built-in networking, stereo 
sound and connectors for a monitor, printer, modem, CD-ROM and other devices. 
The 6100/60 ($1,819) comes with a 160-megabyte hard disk and one expansion 
slot. The 7100/66 ($2,899) comes with a 250-megabyte hard disk and three 
expansion slots, and the 8100/80 ($4,249) has a mini-tower case, three 
expansion slots, a 250-megabyte hard disk and support for up to 16.7 million 
colors. For each model, the number after the slash represents the speed of the 
CPU in megahertz. Apple is also offering a $700 upgrade option for some 
existing machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get too excited by what may seem like low initial prices. While they are 
quite reasonable by Macintosh standards, the basic prices do not include a 
monitor or keyboard, and most users of this class of machine will want larger 
hard drives and more memory. I suspect that a lot of buyers will spend between 
$500 and $1,000 more than the base price.  
</P>
<P>
 Because they require new versions of software to strut their stuff, these new 
machines represent an investment in the future. If I were already in the market 
for a high-end Mac, I'd certainly consider a Power Mac, but I wouldn't upgrade 
from an existing machine until I could get Power Mac versions of my favorite 
programs -- unless, of course, I were a software developer or just couldn't 
wait to get my hands on the latest computer toy.

AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: IT'S THE BIG FISH TO KEEP IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE 
POND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When fish fanciers recently gathered in Gardena, it was to separate the koi 
from the koi-polloi. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the biggest splash was a six-year-old kohaku (red and white) female, a 
2 1/2-footer that bested about 500 others to swim away with the championship 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 20th anniversary show of the Southern California Chapter, Zen 
Nippon Airinkai. (That, in Japanese, means "friendship through scales.") 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants, arriving in plastic bags, were released into big vinyl tanks that 
look for all the world like back yard kiddie pools. Judges moved from tank to 
tank, peering down at the fish and assessing them from tail to whiskers. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you tell a cool koi from a so-so koi? For that matter, a boy koi from a 
goil koi? It's all about body shape and color patterns. Clean, well-defined 
splotches of color are good. Spattery -- as in Jackson Pollock -- is bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Rorschach's patients saw wondrous things in ink blots, the Japanese -- 
who popularized the koi -- see on the backs of the fish not blobs of color, but 
fanciful shapes such as Napoleon's hat, cherry blossoms and Mount Fuji. They've 
gone so far as to name them accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The cream of the crop still come from Japan where, through years of 
inbreeding, the fish has mutated from a dreary but delicious dinner delicacy 
into a vividly colored and pricey pond pet. 
</P>
<P>
 As exhibitor Ben Plonski of Laguna Koi Ponds put it, "They all started out as 
mud carp, kind of grayish-green. Then, about 100 years ago, one guy popped up 
with a little red on him and, wow!" 
</P>
<P>
 Like Zen Nippon Airinkai chapter president Bob Estrella of Cerritos, people 
typically get hooked on koi the day they decide to pretty up their garden. So 
they dig a pond and buy a few goldfish -- the koi's less regal kissing cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, they find themselves forking over $200-$1,000 for a serious show 
circuit koi. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges put a $30,000 price tag on Gardena's grand champion, bred in Japan and 
owned by Katsuji Nerio of Chino. But, unlike the master of a best-of-show dog, 
Nerio doesn't stand to cash in with future generations. It seems that koi are 
genetically unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrella explains, "You breed two brown cocker spaniels, you get a brown 
cocker spaniel." But two red and white koi might produce black or white or red 
koi. 
</P>
<P>
 Koi have other disconcerting habits, such as eating their young. But those 
that survive commonly live to 70 years old or so. A Japanese specimen is 
reported to have made it to 226. In that country, observed judge Jack Stone of 
Tucson, "they can depreciate them" on their tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Koi don't mind cold water and are versatile eaters (fish pellets, veggies, 
Cheerios, whatever). What's more, koi lovers will tell you, they are 
affectionate -- they like to be petted and will swim over to nuzzle the hand 
that feeds them. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartment dwellers might note that koi can be kept in indoor aquariums. But, 
Plonski points out, those pretty patterns are meant to be admired from above. 
"They may look weird from the side." Because What Are Husbands for Anyway?

 Monica Ballard of West L.A.-based Parallax Education, which gives seminars on 
sexual harassment in the workplace, passes along this nugget from a Fortune 100 
client. It's verbatim from the company's 1930s employee manual: 
</P>
<P>
 "Married women are not to be employed, except 
</P>
<P>
 1. where their husbands are incapable of supporting them by reason of physical 
disability or mental incompetency, and 
</P>
<P>
 2. for temporary employment (a period not exceeding 6 months). 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the manual instructs, "Single women are to be notified at the time of 
their employment that their service will terminate within 60 days after their 
marriage."

HERE OR BUST."

 Yukiyasu (his calling cards say "Call me Yuki") Togo and his wife, Misako, who 
have been instrumental in forging Japanese-American relationships, took the 
spotlight at the Regent Beverly Wilshire last week as the Japan America 
Symphony Assn. honored the couple for a decade of contributions to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Princess Yasuko Konoe, first cousin of the emperor of Japan, flew in from 
Tokyo to be honorary imperial chairwoman. With her was her husband, Tadateru 
Konoe, brother of the prime minister. And Eiji Toyoda, chairman emeritus of 
Toyota Motor Corp. Japan, arrived with his wife, Kazuko, to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Togo is the former president and CEO of Toyota Motor Sales USA, and he and his 
wife have been instrumental players in charitable causes including the Los 
Angeles Music Center, the Los Angeles Urban League and the National Multiple 
Sclerosis Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The invitation from chairman Kenneth Tokita, an oncologist at St. Johns 
Hospital in Santa Monica, and his wife, Sandie (in a stunning Badgley Mischka 
gown) said "formal" and numerous ladies among the 640 guests at the affair 
opted for colorful silk kimonos and obis. Etsuko Price, attending with her 
husband, Joe (they're donors to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art), was 
stately in a kimono. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those at head tables were Barbara and Marvin Davis; Walter and Speedy 
Beran; Lodwrick and Carole Cooke; Bill and Keith Kieschnick; Consul Gen. of 
Japan Seiichiro Noboru and his wife, Yoko; and Maria Hodgson, wife of former 
U.S. Ambassador to Japan James D. Hodgson. 
</P>
<P>
 When Togo received an honorary baton at the podium, he first seemed to reject 
it. He stepped to center stage and indulged in a few humorous calisthenics. 
Then he returned for his baton and led orchestra members in Mozart's "Eine 
kleine Nachtmusik." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those applauding was a crowd including Japanese actor Sonna Chiva, Henry 
and Val Noguchi, Paul and Hisako Terasaki, David and Tina Nishida, Michael and 
Mimi Mullen, Gary Omura and Masahiko and Mitsuko Oe. The affair raised 
$250,000.

 'S Wonderful: Gordon Davidson led the kickoff party for Center Theatre Group's 
Salon Evening III in a specially written serenade of " 'S Wonderful" the other 
evening at Bottega Veneta in Beverly Hills. The evening was a salute to Salon 
star Michael Feinstein, who will entertain on stage at the Mark Taper Forum on 
April 25 in a special musical tribute to Alan Jay Lerner, giant of American 
musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Olsen Livingston, Lerner's wife when he wrote "My Fair Lady," is 
co-chairing the evening with Phyllis Hennigan, Joan Burns and Patti Skouras. 
Invitations go out next week. All funds go to CTG, the Mark Taper Forum and the 
Ahmanson and Doolittle theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Over luncheon at Le Dome, the chairwomen envisioned the evening and Livingston 
recounted, with tune and lyrics and animation, the night Lerner and Lowe wrote 
"The Rain in Spain." 
</P>
<P>
 "They woke me up in the middle of the night, bundled me up and pushed me in 
the snow across the road to where they'd been working all night. Then they 
played both parts -- running around like children. Fritz was at the piano . . . 
Alan takes over . . . Fritz runs over and plays Eliza Doolittle -- 'The rain in 
Spain falls mainly on the plain.' Then they ended up laughing hysterically and 
falling on the sofa. Then they looked at me. 'What do you think?' " Nancy told 
them it would stop the show. Of course she was right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salon Evening Series is dedicated to the memory of the late producer Nick 
Vanoff, an ardent CTG supporter.

 Real World: At the Beverly Hilton last weekend, the parking situation was 
unbelievable. The Junior League of Los Angeles hosted a spirited salute to 
Nancy Reagan in the Grand Ballroom. And in the International Ballroom, the 
Merchants Club for City of Hope Regal Ball raised $1 million-plus for gene 
therapy research while honoring Diane Trauth Randall. 
</P>
<P>
 Said hotel owner Merv Griffin, who sat at Reagan's right, "If you think it was 
bad earlier, wait till you leave." But, the parties broke up at different 
times, and getting out was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the league's "Affair to Remember," people cheered as if they were at a 
political rally as benefit chairwoman Linda Small announced a surprise guest 
and Nancy Reagan's "roommate," the former President, walked in.  
</P>
<P>
 Emily Hsu and Melina Montoya, vice chairwomen of the party, bustled all 
evening, tending details of the silent auction andlive auction conducted by Jim 
Hill. League President Ann Zimmerman saluted Nancy Reagan for her "love of a 
child" campaign and work with "Just Say No."  
</P>
<P>
 In the crowd: Carrie and Peter Tilton, Mollie Shea, John Dietsch, Maureen and 
Matthew Cline, Dawne Ward, Jodi and Scott Adair, Ellen and Doug Weitman, Kim 
and Richard Iselin, Lisa Nesbit, Janet and David O'Neil, Marian Miller, Nancy 
Hindle-Katel and Bettina and Glenn Duval. At one of the two tables of Reagan 
friends was Jean Smith, wife of the late U.S. Attorney General William French 
Smith. She is former president of the National Assn. of Junior Leagues and a 
former L.A. president, too. She was with Ross Barrett, husband of the late Rita 
Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Regal Ball, veteran comedian Norm Crosby presented the fourth annual 
Norm Crosby Goodwill Ambassador Award to Randall, owner of Rabbit Rabbit De s 
igns.  
</P>
<P>
 The Merchants Club is the medical center's apparel industry support group. 
Joining in the applause were president Donald Ladinsky and his wife, Shirley, 
who was dinner chairwoman, Barry Sacks and City of Hope president/CEO Dr. 
Sanford M. Shapero, who escorted Giorgio Beverly Hills president/CEO Linda 
LoRe.

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: J. P. DONLEAVY REVISITS WORLD OF 'GINGER MAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, Paul D. Colford is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, to have been in Dublin when the second war was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tremendous from the point of view that Ireland was the only place in 
Europe that wasn't damaged and blown up," says writer J. P. Donleavy, an 
ex-Navy man who was attending Trinity College on the GI Bill of Rights during 
that euphoric time.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were eggs and butter. This sounds crazy now, but to have a piece of 
butter or a steak was a miraculous thing," he recalls. "Almost every evening, 
when the pub would get jammed, it was a kind of celebration. I think it was a 
romanticized time in a way. There could have been an unconscious feeling that 
this was the beginning of world peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Donleavy, author of "The Ginger Man," the comic classic and perennial seller 
set in that colorful time and place, takes us back again in "The History of The 
Ginger Man" (Houghton Mifflin). The fitting publication date is today, St. 
Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The new book is an autobiographical howler that traces the Brooklyn-born 
transplant's Irish romps with the mischievous writer Brendan Behan, Gainor 
Stephen Crist and Maurice Girodias, whose Paris-based Olympia Press first 
published "The Ginger Man" in 1955, after it was turned down by American 
publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Behan was the first to read the book and encourage Donleavy as a novelist, 
Crist the model for Sebastian Dangerfield, the Ginger Man himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Crist was a slothful Midwestern charmer who believed in "vegetative nirvana" 
-- that is, "the possibility of energy emanating from the inertia of absolute 
indolence." One day he had to run for his bus from a restaurant, but did so 
while holding his plate and beer bottle. He then took a seat and continued 
eating. As Behan described the episode, Donleavy writes: "Now, I'll you one 
thing . . . whatever else we may say or think about him, one thing is a 
certainty that he has as a human being demonstrated his great practicality." 
</P>
<P>
 Donleavy, 67, an Irish citizen since 1967, lives like a reclusive squire in an 
18th-Century mansion on 200 acres in the Westmeath countryside. Resplendent 
this day in a corduroy suit, his tweed cap on the table, the white-haired Irish 
countryman and Bernard Shaw look-alike sits by a fire during a visit to New 
York and appears ages removed from the brawling Yank who lived his book's saucy 
tales. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he reads hardly any literary fiction -- he prefers newspapers -- and 
he looks with mournful disdain at the commercial imperative that he considers 
the curse of the writing life in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I failed to get 'The Ginger Man' published here, I realized that this 
wasn't any place I was ever going to survive," he says. "I became very 
conscious of the writer's role. You know, it's like a baseball game. You get 
up, it's three strikes, you're out, or you hit a home run, whereas in Europe I 
was conscious of the fact that you're a writer and you stay that way. You begin 
that way, you end that way." 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent years, Donleavy says, a feminist backlash in American 
publishing circles has come to impede him. Although he offers no specifics to 
support his suspicion, he says he cannot find a publisher for a third volume of 
his "Schultz" series of novels, in which his main character is arranging to 
have a hit man kill his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Donleavy has always been his own literary agent and is known as a tenacious 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an unbelievable fan of his," says Carl Navarre, who in the mid-1980s 
obtained the lucrative paperback rights to "The Ginger Man" for Atlantic 
Monthly Press after cutting the deal with Donleavy himself. "He is an 
incredible negotiator."  
</P>
<P>
 "An agent knows when you're washed up and you're finished, and is likely to 
circulate that, when all writers are always on the verge of being washed up and 
finished," Donleavy explains. "I mean, they need that to live. You have to be 
washed up and finished, mentally, just to go on to do the next thing, to keep 
the battle going." 
</P>

 B Matter: A sobering tidbit reported by Media Industry Newsletter: Time and 
Newsweek did mid-May cover stories on Bosnia that ended up being their 
worst-selling covers of 1993. For Newsweek, the biggest newsstand hit of the 
year was a June 21 cover on lesbians; for Time, it was the January profile of 
Bill Clinton, the 1992 Man of the Year . . . "Obsession: The Lives and Times of 
Calvin Klein," a hot potato of an unauthorized biography that was dropped last 
year by G. P. Putnam's Sons, is nearing publication under the Carol Publishing 
Group's flag. No galley copies are being circulated before the late-April 
release of the book, written by Steven Gaines and Sharon Churcher.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; CAPTIVATING, COMPLICATED CORA SHARPE; DELUSIONS OF GRANDMA 
BY CARRIE FISHER ; SIMON & SCHUSTER, $22, 255 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DORRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first 185 pages of her new novel, "Delusions of Grandma," Carrie 
Fisher manages an amazing achievement: a snappy, wise-cracking novel that 
imperceptibly and without any loss of bite turns wrenching, poignant and wise. 
</P>
<P>
 As narrated by Cora Sharpe, script doctor extraordinaire -- we want to say to 
her, using Fisher's distinctive brand of quip, "Physician, rewrite thyself" -- 
this is a reluctant love story of a relationship backed into. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora, "a captive of her own captivating quality," is a character you want to 
hang around just to see what observation she'll toss off next. Smart doesn't 
begin to do her justice. She decides, for instance, that the phenomenon of 
talk-show hosts interviewing other talk-show hosts is "one of the twelve signs 
that the world is ending." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Are you seeing anyone?' was a phrase she enjoyed -- it implied that there 
are people you see and people you hear. And those you saw, you dated. The rest 
you experienced by phone." 
</P>
<P>
 When she meets Ray, Cora represses her initial aversion to his career (he's a 
lawyer), and becomes smitten: 
</P>
<P>
 "She stared at Ray's long, ringless fingers, his pale, careful hands, his 
straight, dark eyelashes. He made a minor vocabulary error and she inwardly, 
magnanimously forgave him." 
</P>
<P>
 Try as she might, she can't go slow. "Some parliament in her pheromones had 
just named him king, and she was doing all she could to keep her cardinals from 
sending up the puff of white smoke from her hair." 
</P>
<P>
 And what do you know? Cora's feelings are reciprocated. More than 
reciprocated: Ray wants to get married, but Cora, burned by past experience, 
hesitates. "She seemed innately proficient in the overlooked skill of letting 
people down. A world-class disappointer, she had made her way though the world 
letting men down without even trying. She took it from knack to virtuosity." 
</P>
<P>
 She was right to worry. "In a sense, as soon as she had Ray, and he her, he 
was a little lost to her forever. She didn't do things quite as right -- he 
didn't love her the way he had out of the box. She never wore as well as that 
first protracted fit. He had closed the deal, and despite the fact that it was 
a dazzling, hungry negotiation, closed was closed. And the next phase was the 
next phase. But just in case, she touched up her makeup before she got in bed 
with him at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Cora has hopes about Ray. "She'd catch commitment from him like a cold," 
and maintain the relationship, even if she wasn't ultimately interested in 
marriage. "Vows seemed ridiculous -- it was hard enough to keep appointments." 
</P>
<P>
 What we don't realize as we happily negotiate our way through her blitz of 
wit, is that Cora is getting to us. That beneath that hard-as-lacquered-nails 
exterior, this is one vulnerable woman who wants -- what do you know? -- what 
most everybody else wants: to be loved, valued, cared about in a lifetime kind 
of way. And just as this revelation dawns on us, three events take place in 
Carrie Fisher's novel: 1) Ray starts to pull away; 2) Cora's old friend 
William, dying of AIDS, moves in; and 3) Ray and Cora rally together, focused 
on helping William -- in the process, comforting each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly we have segued into a different kind of novel -- stripped of their 
mutual artifice, Ray and Cora emerge as brave, kind, decent people, and she, 
without quite admitting it, finds herself in love. 
</P>
<P>
 At which point, of course, William dies and Ray, true to Cora's experience of 
male form, leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakup scene is painful, dignified -- just right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cora had stopped listening somewhere in the middle of what he said, 
concentrating more on the rhythm and the tone until his voice stopped and she 
could pluck herself from this place of hurt. Eventually she realized that Ray 
had stopped talking and was staring at her." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cora is a survivor, and when she discovers that she's pregnant, she 
decides to keep the baby and re-insulates herself with humor. "The trouble with 
getting introspective when you're pregnant," she says to her writing partner, 
Bud, "is that you never know who you might run into." 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding that all the baby (she's sure it will be a girl) will inherit from 
the father is "his ability to sleep during the day," Cora sets about getting 
her life in order. 
</P>
<P>
 And where in all this, you may ask, is the eponymous "Grandma"? Don't ask. 
When Viv, Cora's retired costume-designer-of-a-mother enters the picture in the 
last brief section, the novel seems to get out of control. Ray, a character 
Fisher has beautifully developed, virtually disappears, replaced by several 
one-dimensional caricatures: the loyal chum, the zaftig mom, the 
dotty-but-more-with-it-than-you-think grandpa. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame, but hey, who says you have to read a book all the way to the 
end? For most of its length, "Delusions of Grandma" is a wildly funny, 
heartbreaking story about the complicated business of love, and Cora is a 
person you wish you could pick up the nearest phone and call. Whatever she had 
to say, you'd want to hear it.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; COUNTING CROWS: A WORK IN PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 S mells like Dylan/Morrison/Springsteen spirit.  
</P>
<P>
 Counting Crows, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the alienation and rage of a gifted new generation of bands, 
led by Nirvana and Pearl Jam, dominate rock commercially and creatively, the 
Counting Crows have become the year's most surprising -- though far from 
unexplainable -- success story. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the feel of something happening here again on the Sunset Strip on 
Tuesday as the Bay Area band -- whose debut Geffen album has soared into the 
national Top 10 -- opened a four-night stand: two shows at the Whisky, then two 
more at the Roxy. All sold out instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the excitement: The music of Adam Duritz and his sidekicks 
offers something largely missing from the diet of the key '90s bands -- the 
poetic, introspective singer-songwriter values of the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, " 'Round Here," which was performed early in Tuesday's set, offers the 
ricochet imagery and youthful wonder of Springsteen's early work, while "Mr. 
Jones" not only takes its title from a character in Dylan's "Ballad of a Thin 
Man," but also mentions rock's most influential writer in the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be Bob Dylan," Duritz sings in "Mr. Jones," a wonderfully appealing 
summation of a young musician's rock-star dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from that playfulness, the Crows' music focuses on the lonely search for 
something or someone to believe in amid the confusions and contradictions of 
life -- and the band sometimes captures that search with captivating warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 While most young '90s bands -- including Nirvana, whose "Smells Like Teen 
Spirit" is the anthem of the angry new sound -- explore similar themes, their 
music is often so abrasive and so relentlessly youth-oriented that it seems 
alien to a large segment of the rock audience, including most people over 25. 
</P>
<P>
 For an audience starved for the more traditional and accessible approach (and 
that surely includes some under 25), the Crows are in some ways the only game 
in town -- and that fact has helped the band's rise. 
</P>
<P>
 What the fans found at the Whisky was an artist who is still struggling to 
find his own voice. The Crows' material is wildly uneven, but that is to be 
expected of most new bands. The question now is whether all this sudden acclaim 
and sales will help or hurt Duritz's development as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 One encouraging sign Tuesday was that the dreadlocked singer seemed aware of 
the challenge ahead. Despite the sudden attention, Duritz was refreshingly down 
to earth on stage. Dressed in a T-shirt and sweat pants, he opened the evening 
on a nice note by personally introducing the opening act -- New York 
singer-songwriter Peter Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 When Duritz, who is in his late 20s, returned later with the Crows, he still 
seemed like someone trying to establish a rapport with the audience rather than 
assuming he already has their allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of coasting on the material from the album, he previewed several new 
songs, which are in the mode of the album's music. The band supported his 
vocals ably with a personalized punctuation that recalls some of the 
roots-accented soulfulness of the band. Still, the evening seemed very much a 
work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crows' next album should go a long way toward telling us whether their 
1994 success was simply a matter of being in the right place at the right time, 
or whether they are indeed capable of extending the legacy that they celebrate. 
</P>

 Leaving the CBS Road: Charles Kuralt announced that he is retiring from CBS 
News after a career that began 37 years ago when he joined the network as a 
radio writer. Although his retirement won't be official until May 1, his last 
"Sunday Morning" broadcast will be Easter morning, April 3. In a statement, 
Kuralt, who has contributed his "On the Road" features to the "CBS Evening 
News" for 25 years, said, "CBS News has been the best place on Earth to have a 
career as a reporter and each of my 37 years has been better than the year 
before. I have done every satisfying thing under the sun in television news and 
would like to explore some side roads of life while I am still in good health 
and good spirits. The first of these will be a book about America, which I will 
embark on now." CBS News President Eric Ober told The Times that a replacement 
for Kuralt would be named shortly. "With the Olympics behind him, his 60th 
birthday coming up and a significant book deal, he told me he just felt the 
timing was right," Ober said. "He's one of the giants of the industry, a great 
writer, great reporter, and obviously it leaves us with . . . a big hole."

 KCET Tackles 'Great War': KCET has received more than $2 million in funding 
for its production of "The Great War: And the Shaping of Our Century," an 
eight-hour series that looks at World War I as "the defining event of the 
modern age." Produced by Blaine Baggett, KCET's director of public affairs and 
feature documentaries, the series is expected to premiere in January of 1996. 
Says Baggett: "One need look no further than Sarajevo to see the war's tragic 
legacy. To understand what is happening now, we must go back to 1914." Funding 
raised includes $1.2 million from the National Endowment for the Humanities and 
an unspecified CPB/PBS Program Challenge Fund Grant.

 'Kids Killing Kids' Special: CBS and Fox will join a nationwide effort 
spotlighting the growing epidemic of youth violence. Both networks will 
broadcast the CBS special "Kids Killing Kids," a drama about the consequences 
of teen-agers using guns to solve their problems and how teen gun violence can 
be stopped, at 8 p.m. on April 26. The hourlong program, which also includes a 
short follow-up documentary, "Kids Saving Kids," will be hosted by actor 
Malcolm-Jamal Warner. The commercial-free special is being billed as the 
television industry's contribution to "Let's Stop Kids Killing Kids," a 
weeklong campaign spearheaded by a broad-based coalition of 70 nationwide 
organizations. MOVIES

 New Label for Rapper's Body Count?: Virgin Records is believed to be close to 
signing a U.S. record contract with rapper Ice-T's metal band Body Count, whose 
1992 Warner Bros. recording of "Cop Killer" came under fire from police groups 
around the country. The criticism continued even after the rapper agreed to 
drop the song from Body Count's album, and he severed ties early last year with 
the Time Warner-owned label. At the time, there was widespread industry 
speculation that no other major label would sign the band, fearing more 
controversy. Neither Virgin nor Ice-T's manager would comment on the proposed 
deal.

 Ozzy Judgment: An Orange County Superior Court jury on Wednesday found rocker 
Ozzy Osborne negligent for inviting the audience to join him on stage at a 1992 
concert at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. But the jury ordered Osbourne's 
insurance company to pay only $60,000 to Kenneth Winkler, a Burbank electrician 
who sued for damages, saying he was trampled in the ensuing melee. Winkler's 
attorney, who had asked for about $250,000, called the judgment "really 
disheartening." QUICK TAKES

CLUB REVIEW; CRAMPED BLUE SALOON TAKES ITS MUSIC SERIOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the first things a newcomer might notice upon entering the Blue Saloon 
is that the patrons appear to be having an inordinate amount of fun. Absent 
from this North Hollywood night spot are the posing and snubbing one typically 
endures at some of the tonier Westside venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing, because there really isn't any room for it. The 6-year-old club 
adds a new dimension to the word cramped : The 100-capacity room holds two pool 
tables, a long bar, a dance floor, a raised platform, a makeshift stage and an 
alarming amount of beer paraphernalia. The Blue Saloon should be subsidized by 
American breweries for displaying more hops and barley signage than possibly 
any other bar in town.  
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere underneath the beer flags, stuffed Spuds McKenzies and 
product-placement pool-table lights is a nightclub that takes its music 
seriously. The Blue Saloon offers a comfortable -- if somewhat confined -- 
haven for live rock, country, rockabilly and blues, and a recent set by the 
Cherry Poppin' Daddies added camp to the list. The eight-member group 
skillfully switches between post-punk songs celebrating body parts to the 
"Rocky Horror"-like show tune "I Was a Teen-Age Brain Surgeon."  
</P>
<P>
 If you're not out to hear live bands, however, find a different watering hole, 
because from the front-door entrance to the behind-stage bathrooms, there's no 
escaping the music.

DANCE REVIEW; HUNGARIAN FOLK ENSEMBLE RIVETING IN 'DANCE WORDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although it was necessary to see the earlier dances to process the movement 
vocabulary that would surface later, nothing -- absolutely nothing -- prepared 
for the searing intensity of "Dance Words," which opened the second part of the 
program by the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble on Tuesday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration for the work dates back to the early '70s, when an underground 
political movement surfaced in Hungary in which young people danced traditional 
folk steps while shouting protest poems by Laszlo Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompaniment was pared down to basic rhythms provided by the poet's text and 
percussive strikes on a cello-like instrument called the gardon , which was 
slung across a musician's chest. Costuming was likewise simplified to everyday 
street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The repressive authorities must have been terrified by the raw power and 
focused anger and invincible spirit evident in the movement and this particular 
work. They banned the piece, created by company artistic director and 
choreographer Sandor Timar, after only four performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every traditional element in the choreography took on a different 
meaning and tone because the verbal accompaniment and the everyday costuming 
raised it to a new level of abstraction, concentration and universality. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's contained arm gestures looked both suppressed and explosive. The 
men's arm-arching turns seemed to be bounding flights of freedom. The fluid 
formations and dissolves among lines of dancers and simple couples suggested 
new social solidarity and relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the artwork created by the youth of his country, Timar has shown 
how 19th-Century traditions can be preserved and made relevant to the late 20th 
Century and even become a laser-like influence into the future. A brilliant 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, for a non-Hungarian, much of the rest of the program, which was 
sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society, looked like a museum 
collection -- perhaps a necessary and authentic and attractive museum 
collection, but one that did not relate to this time and the future as did this 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
 This judgment may be unfair because texts for all the songs were not 
available, which meant an incomplete understanding of their contexts. (Press 
members did receive a copy of Nagy's poem, but only after the piece was 
danced). Still, the relentless up-beat quality of the other works mitigated 
against such contemporaneity.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; RICHARD THOMPSON SHOWS TWO EQUALLY SATISFYING SIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an electric guitarist, Richard Thompson is a string-bender extraordinaire, 
never bending to convention with his definably weird, siren-like, jazz-baiting 
solos that insanely intensify and bite, sting and buzz around the key. On 
acoustic, though, he's something else altogether: a correct English gentleman, 
doing the most muss-less, careful, dead-on picking a craftsman could 
cultivate.He's the Jekyll and Hyde of guitar heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's show on Tuesday at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre was a pleasing 
trade-off between those two equally satisfying sides, compromising the 
intensity of his full-band "rock" shows with the dry wit and unassuming 
nimbleness of his "folk" sets. Backed by three veterans equally adept at hard 
rock and traditional Irish folk, Thompson afforded fans a rare configuration 
that had him alternately cutting loudly loose and staying quietly, properly 
tight. If it lacked momentum, it gave good breadth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the 24 songs came from his latest album, "Mirror Blue," by no means 
one of his more memorable. This didn't matter much, as such new songs as "The 
Way That It Shows" sometimes picked up a fury rivaling the chaos of his standby 
"Shoot Out the Lights." With former Fairport Convention cohort Dave Mattacks 
drumming and Pentangle "rival" Danny Thompson on bass, and Pete Zorn weighing 
in with whistle, soprano sax, et al., Thompson also fed the faithful choice, 
somber obscurities such as "The Sun Never Shines on the Poor." 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Thompson also plays Friday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano , (714) 496-8930. $18.50. 9 p.m. CHRIS WILLMAN

TV REVIEW; 'IRISH' AN ENJOYABLE ROCK, FOLK TRAVELOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For St. Patrick's Day viewing, if you can't dig up that old tape of John 
Belushi waxing convulsive about "the luck of the Irish," the next best bet is 
the Disney Channel special "Irish Music and America . . . A Musical Migration," 
a travelogue with contemporary rock and folk singers tracing their musical 
lineage back to the Blarney Stone, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
 U2's Bono talks about arriving in Memphis and realizing just how inherently 
Irish the original American roots-rock that had its sway on him was.Elvis 
Costello, an Englishman with a home in Ireland, speaks of discovering one's 
musical heritage not necessarily "in a scholarly way" but as "to pick it apart 
like a child with a toy"; upon tinkering, he finds the direct line from 
Scottish murder ballads to the Louvens to the Everly Brothers to the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances here constitute the biggest draw for music buffs: With 
assistance from the Edge, Bono sings "A Wild Irish Rose," an ironic ballad 
inspired by seeing downtown L.A.'s Skid Row denizens drinking the titular 
booze. A bit of a new murder ballad of Costello's own, "Mischievous Ghost," 
pops up. Richard Thompson, the Everlys, Luka Bloom, the Clancy Brothers and 
others put in passing vocal appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrator Emmylou Harris -- no stranger to trios -- joins up with Irishwomen 
Mary Black and Dolores Keane for the traditional "Sonny," as lovely as you'd 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffs may lament, though, that the songs are all cut up or briefly excerpted 
-- a particular liability when dealing with curiosities like unreleased U2 and 
Costello stuff -- so that Harris can go back to narrating the historical sorry 
lot of the Irish, making the special slightly too sober as well as frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Irish Music and America . . . A Musical Migration" premieres on the Disney 
Channel at 10:05 tonight.

WESTSIDE WATCH; OLD QUOTES NEVER DIE, THEY JUST KEEP FLOODING IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As they are wont to do, Mar Vista architects Ron Radziner and Lee Marmol are 
using the lighted sign outside their studio to make a statement -- this time 
political. 
</P>
<P>
 In big, black letters, the sign reads: "When the President does it that means 
it's not illegal -- Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Nixon did make that remark -- on May 20, 1977, during an interview with 
David Frost. Radziner and Marmol say that given the Whitewater flap plaguing 
the Clinton Administration, now seems a good time to resurrect the quote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not trying to make any judgments on (Whitewater)," Ron Radziner said. 
"(But) we thought the quote was humorous and provided some additional comment 
(on the matter)." 
</P>
<P>
 The architects inherited the storefront sign two years ago, when they moved 
into their offices on Centinela Avenue just south of Palms Boulevard. Quoting 
everyone from Martin Luther King Jr. to J. Paul Getty, they showcase words of 
wisdom about the environment, architecture, social issues and more. Initially, 
the quotes were intended as a takeoff on the price listing posted across the 
street, outside the Mrs. Gooch's market.

 Sure beats reading that salmon steak costs $6.95 a pound.

 SEX IN THE SURF: Forget Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr's famous roll in the 
sand. Grunion are once again flinging themselves on California beaches to 
reproduce -- to the delight of voyeurs on shore. 
</P>
<P>
 This week marked the first run of the grunion season, which lasts roughly from 
March through July, says Dan Zambrano, a biologist with the Cabrillo Marine 
Aquarium in San Pedro. For a few days at roughly two-week intervals, the small 
silvery fish surf onto beaches, mate in the sand and then return to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The grunion come ashore on virtually any sandy beach. But in San Pedro they 
seem to be attracting particularly close attention. About 1,000 people turned 
out Sunday night for a grunion-watching session organized by the Cabrillo 
Marine Museum, Zambrano says. 
</P>
<P>
 Has grunion mating become L.A.'s newest spectator sport? Says Zambrano: "One 
guy said that this might be sex in the '90s -- watching other creatures do it."

 VOTES ON THE LINE: Beverly Hills Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum, seeking 
reelection to a third term, announced Tuesday that he has set up a 24-hour 
phone line to reach voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he touts the line -- called "Feedback!" -- as "our own on-ramp for the 
information superhighway," Tanenbaum does a lot of the driving. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, residents who call (310) 335-1294 will have the opportunity to 
leave their comments and questions. But they will first hear a prerecorded 
campaign message from Tanenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first commentary, the former New York City prosecutor addresses crime 
control and the need for more on-street policing. Although several candidates 
recommend hiring more officers for the 130-member force, Tanenbaum insists that 
what the city needs is not more officers, but different deployment.

CRASH RAISES AIRPORT NEIGHBORS' FEARS; AVIATION: SECOND INCIDENT IN LESS THAN 
FOUR MONTHS RENEWS CONCERNS ABOUT LARGER AIRCRAFT. OFFICIALS SAY THE SANTA 
MONICA FACILITY IS ONE OF THE SAFEST OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION. 
</P>

<P>
 The second plane crash involving Santa Monica Airport in less than four months 
has renewed neighborhood criticism of the busy facility, with some residents 
insisting it is only a matter of time before a much larger aircraft goes down 
-- with catastrophic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is the big, old jets," said Virginia Ernst, a longtime critic of 
the airport who lives on Sardis Avenue near the east end of the runway. "I'm 
scared to death one of those things is going to come down and wipe out an 
entire neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents suggested that last Friday's crash of a four-seat, 
propeller-driven Piper 28 into a vacant South Barrington Avenue house could 
provide the impetus for a grass-roots coalition that would work to address 
issues from jet fumes to helicopter traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 One of two people aboard the aircraft was killed in Friday's crash, which 
occurred after the plane developed engine trouble as it attempted to land at 
the airport about half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was Greg Leslie, a 35-year-old rock musician and airplane mechanic 
who was seen before the crash working on the plane with his friend, David 
Thompson, 22, of Culver City, who was the pilot of the aircraft. Thompson was 
released earlier this week from UCLA Medical Center after treatment for a 
broken leg and second-degree burns on his hands and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 While federal investigators continued this week to search for a cause of the 
crash, airport officials maintained that the airport, one of the busiest 
single-runway facilities in the nation, is exceptionally safe. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has ever been killed on the ground as the result of an incident 
involving the 75-year-old airport -- a record that Manager Tim Walsh said 
"speaks for itself." But that record has been tested of late. Aside from 
Friday's crash, which set a house ablaze, a small plane struck an apartment 
house in Santa Monica in November, killing the two men aboard the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the airport and even some of its critics cautioned this week 
against reading too much into the latest incidents, with some neighbors 
expressing resignation that the risks associated with living near an airport 
will never be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always going to be some chance in hell that something is going to go 
wrong with an airplane," said Stan Dounn, a tenants' activist at Lincoln Place 
Apartments, a 795-unit complex in Venice just west of the airfield. "You live 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Dounn said he hopes the crash spurs scattered Westside 
neighborhoods to address airport issues such as noise and fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may galvanize us into some sort of coalition," he said. In the past, 
neighborhoods have pressured the airport "at different times in different 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Century City resident Karin Machleder also hinted at a grass-roots campaign, 
which may involve the distribution of leaflets to protest the dangers posed by 
the seemingly endless procession of aircraft flying into and out of the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to be getting louder, lower and bigger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate jet traffic, which has grown dramatically in recent years, has 
fueled fears of a major accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a little plane that got in trouble, and that happens," Ernst said. 
"I'm concerned about the big ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh countered that corporate jets are safer than single-engine planes; they 
require significantly more pilot training to operate and have better safety 
records than commercial airliners. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance of a jet crashing into a Westside neighborhood, he asserted, is 
highly unlikely.

MAN WHO DIED IN PLANE CRASH LOVED FLYING, ROCK 'N' ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As investigators searched for the cause of last Friday's plane crash, 
grief-stricken friends of Greg Leslie, the passenger who died, remembered a 
sweet-tempered man who loved flying and playing rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never had a bad thing to say about anybody and, being musicians, we all 
travel in pretty cynical circles," recalled Kelly Pattrik, Leslie's friend, 
roommate and fellow band member. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, guitarist for the Hollywood-based rock band Grind, was killed Friday 
evening when the Piper 28 he was riding in struck a house near the intersection 
of Barrington and National boulevards and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old Cleveland native, who was divorced and had no children, was a 
part-time free-lance airplane mechanic. He worked primarily on planes belonging 
to Stuart Niemi, owner of Silver Wing Aviation Inc., an aircraft dealer based 
at Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hours before his death, he was helping David Thompson, a friend and the 
pilot of the plane that crashed, work on the Piper. Once it was running to 
their satisfaction, Thompson, an experienced pilot and an aviation mechanic for 
Continental Airlines, apparently asked Leslie if he wanted to take a quick spin 
around the airport to try it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those things," Niemi speculated. "The guy said, 'Hey, Greg, I'm 
going to fly this thing around the pattern,' and he said, 'Sure, I could use 
the relaxation. I've been working all day.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, Leslie, a pilot himself, was dead. Passersby who rushed to 
the scene of the crash were unable to free the injured and sobbing man from the 
burning airplane, leaving friends and acquaintances to ponder his final 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sit here and listen to the accounts of how he died . . . ," said Judi 
Barker, her voice trailing off. Barker owns the hangar where Thompson stored 
his plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was released earlier this week from UCLA Medical Center after 
treatment for a broken leg and second-degree burns on his hands and arms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sad bit of irony, she noted, Leslie's band was going to play in an 
airport benefit for the families of two men killed in the crash of a small 
plane in Santa Monica in November.

TOPICS / POLITICS; DEVELOPMENT ISSUES DOMINATE MALIBU CITY COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The six candidates running for two seats on the Malibu City Council agree 
development must be closely controlled. But several of them are split on how to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 No issue draws the interest and ire of Malibu residents as development and how 
to restrain it. It was dissatisfaction with Los Angeles County's land-use 
decisions and bureaucracy that fueled the city's incorporation drive in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the third election since incorporation, the candidates have focused on 
the latest development concern: how to protect the town's rural beauty without 
infringing on the rights of single-family homeowners to improve their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Running in the April 12 election are incumbents Walt Keller and John Harlow; 
Tom Hasse, 33, a city of Los Angeles management analyst; Jeff Jennings, 50, an 
attorney; Louis Ragsdale, 72, a semi-retired real estate agent, and Robert 
Stratman, 71, a retired educator. 
</P>
<P>
 Harlow, Jennings and Ragsdale said a draft of the General Plan, which will 
guide Malibu's growth, places too many restrictions on homeowners who want to 
develop their land. Hasse and Keller, meanwhile, said such controls are needed 
to preserve the town's rustic flavor. Stratman declined to speak in detail on 
the subject, preferring to focus on improving the city's tax base and what he 
believes is a dearth of leadership on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Harlow, a retired division manager of Hughes Aircraft Co., was appointed in 
1992 to fill the unexpired term of then-mayor Larry Wan, who resigned. Often 
the dissenting voice on the five-member council, he has called the draft 
General Plan "the silent killer of the homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why we need all these regulations for every facet of what a 
homeowner wants to do to their property," he said. "Are all these rules really 
enhancing the value of their property?" 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Harlow objects to the plan's proposal to create seven 
environmental and conservation review departments, any of which could oversee 
proposals for single-family construction and remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became a city to get away from county bureaucracy, and the council is 
replacing it with their own," said Harlow, 63. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, Harlow said, will be more restrictive than the interim zoning 
ordinance, a stopgap law the city passed last March that will be in effect 
until it adopts a General Plan, due by November under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the ordinance restricts the height of houses to 18 feet 
and limits their size to 5,000 square feet on a half-acre lot and 7,000 square 
feet on an acre lot. To exceed those standards, a homeowner must obtain council 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Harlow said he would seek to ensure such tight provisions not be incorporated 
into the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings called the draft General Plan "undemocratic" and "a broad scatter gun 
that hits everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Ragsdale, a real estate agent, said the only thing left out of the draft 
General Plan was the "birthing process of a human being." He said the plan will 
choke the community with regulations "that are devaluing property and 
businesses, many of which have failed in Malibu." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the draft see it as a key step toward open space 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasse, 33, disputes that the plan is too restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasse, endorsed by Mayor Carolyn Van Horn and Mayor Pro Tem Jeff Kramer, also 
has suggested a bond issue to raise money to purchase private property that 
would be maintained as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, who is seeking another four-year term, finds nothing burdensome about 
the zoning ordinance or the draft General Plan. A retired aerospace engineer 
who has been on the council since cityhood, Keller has epitomized the 
community's spirit of protectionism. He has been an architect of the city's 
slow-growth dictum that is expected to be formalized in the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not doing anything that general plans in Carmel, Saratoga and Lafayette 
haven't done," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think private property rights go both ways," Keller said. "We're looking 
for a win-win situation. I take my orders from the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratman, 72, said he has not read all of the General Plan draft and declined 
to discuss the interim zoning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would improve leadership on the council and shore up the city's tax 
base, which he contends could benefit from development of a controversial 
parcel in the heart of the city. He suggested luring a think tank to the 
property, where developers unsuccessfully sought to build an 815-unit mixed-use 
project.

TOPICS / BRIEFLY; ART: GETTY MODEL AIDS MUMMY PRESERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Getty Conservation Institute's innovative design of a case for maintaining 
mummies and other fragile organic materials was used as a model recently by an 
Egyptian museum to restore the Royal Mummies to public view. 
</P>
<P>
 The case sustains an environment that stems the erosion of mummies by 
preventing microbiological activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Getty prototype, the Egyptian Antiquities Organization in Cairo 
built nine cases for the Egyptian Museum that employ a nitrogen atmosphere and 
a system for monitoring temperature, humidity and oxygen levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian cases were based on the Getty's 1987 prototype, for which 
scientists used an anonymous mummy dubbed "Lady X" to develop a way to display 
and store mummies and other fragile organic materials. 
</P>
<P>
 After much experimentation, the scientists developed a case in which a 
nitrogen atmosphere capable of halting microbiological activity could be 
sustained without mechanical or electrical systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Mummies exhibit opened March 1 at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the Getty Conservation Institute was not involved in the actual 
construction or testing of the Egyptian Museum's cases, I am delighted that our 
research has been instrumental in helping the museum achieve its goal of 
safeguarding the Royal Mummies," said Miguel Angel Corzo, Getty Conservation 
Institute director.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTCHESTER; COUNTRY FAIR CANCELED AFTER IMPASSE OVER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was supposed to be a weekend of fun, with thousands of dollars from the 
proceeds of food stands, arts and crafts booths and carnival rides going to 
local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Westchester Country Fair has been canceled -- the victim, depending on 
whom you talk to, of Los Angeles City Hall, the Jan. 17 earthquake or a simple 
communication lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fund-raiser was for our schools, not the city recreation and parks 
general fund," said principal organizer Sandy Luboviski, chairwoman of the 
education committee of the Westchester/LAX Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a sad day when the city can destroy the momentum of positive energy 
generated toward helping our children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they were told months ago that permit fees for the April 22 
event at Westchester Park would total no more $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 But they learned about two weeks ago that the parks department wanted $10,000 
and 5% of the gross revenues. Earlier meetings where the fees might have been 
clarified were put off because of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty much the whole profit right there," said Donald W. Savoie, 
executive director of the chamber, which has sponsored the event since 1991. 
"We only gave $10,400 to the schools last year as it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and Mayor Richard Riordan were 
called in and frantic negotiations won some concessions from department 
officials, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 David R. Gonzalez, assistant general manager of the Recreation and Parks 
Department, said he cut fees as much as he could when he learned of the 
chamber's difficulties last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he could not do away with charges for staging the carnival and for 
the use of individual booths, he said he managed to cancel the fees for using 
the site, maintenance and rangers' services, among others. (Luboviski said the 
new fees totaled $3,600.) 
</P>
<P>
 The last he heard, Gonzalez said Wednesday, was that that solution would be 
acceptable to the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Prang, a spokesman for Galanter, said the misunderstanding was due to 
"a chain of unfortunate things," including the parks department's erroneous 
estimate of $600 a day in city fees and the earthquake, which preoccupied 
department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Prang said chamber officials apparently did not understand the complexity of 
organizing such a large-scale event on city property. The fair had been held at 
Loyola Marymount University, but it was unavailable this year because of 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 After a last-minute flurry of futile telephone calls and faxes, the chamber's 
executive committee, fearing possible losses, voted on Friday to call the whole 
thing off. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's fair netted at least $800 for each of 13 public and private 
schools in the Westchester area, all of which contributed dozens of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools also kept the revenue from T-shirt and advance ticket sales, 
yielding as much as $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say we're severely disappointed," said Tony Cooper, principal of 
the private Westchester Neighborhood School. The school used the money from 
previous fairs for computer software, basketball equipment and class furniture, 
Cooper said. MATHIS CHAZANOV

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED TO FIGHT DUMPING IN STORM DRAINS 
</P>

<P>
 Heal the Bay, a Santa Monica-based environmental group known for its 
grass-roots efforts at cleaning up local waters, will help launch a program 
next week to educate people about the dangers of dumping hazardous waste in 
storm drains, which empty into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the so-called Gutter Patrol program, conducted in conjunction with the 
Los Angeles city and county public works departments, volunteers will place 
65,000 stenciled signs reading "No Dumping, This Drains to Ocean" on storm 
drains across Los Angeles County.Volunteers will also hand out tip sheets on 
how to recognize hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to be completed in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 volunteers, environmentalists, politicians and celebrities will 
kick off the program March 24 at 11 a.m. at DeLongpre Park in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban storm water runoff contributes the largest amount of pollution to area 
beaches, Heal the Bay Executive Director Adi Liberman said. Rainwater washes 
fertilizers, motor oil, pet droppings and other pollutants into storm drains, 
which flush into the sea. DAMITA J. QUASHIE

AVIATION: CONCERN ABOUT CITIZEN RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another pilot out of Santa Monica Airport loses control of his aircraft, 
another person dead, another Westside home heavily damaged (Metro, March 12). 
</P>
<P>
 Private aviation at Santa Monica Airport may be likened to smoking -- it is 
legal, it is supported by the government and it is enjoyable to those who 
participate in it.It is also dangerous to those who live nearby and must suffer 
the consequences of the noise, the pollution, and the increasingly frequent 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Please don't trot out that tired refrain, "the airport was there before the 
homes." (Westside, Feb. 17) When I bought my home in 1972, jets were not 
allowed. Now jets and the fuel for them are welcome at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Touch-and-go exercises, student pilots, home-built aircraft and private 
aviation exacerbate the environment and obviously need tighter regulation if 
they are to continue to operate with no place to make emergency landings but in 
Westside neighborhoods.

ENVIRONMENT: FISH POND ON CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water (from the natural springs at University High School) can be used for a 
fish pond where students could go fishing (Plugging the Leak, Westside, March 
13, 1994).If the water is cold enough, it could be stocked with trout. More 
likely, it would be necessary to use warm-water species such as bluegill. 
</P>
<P>
 I would volunteer to teach students something about insect life, fish habits, 
fly-tying and fishing courtesy. A schedule could be set up in case of 
overwhelming response, students could be scheduled, or fishing privileges 
awarded for good school performance or behavior.

 Make school fun!

COVER STORY; A HOUSE DIVIDED IN SANTA MONICA; CITY'S REBUILDING EFFORT SEEKS 
DELICATE BALANCE, BUT RENTERS AND LANDLORDS FEEL LIKE LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a cacophony of construction sounds emanating from every corner of 
town, neither landlords nor their dispossessed tenants have anything to 
celebrate on this two-month anniversary of the quake that shook up Santa Monica 
in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 The gloom is understandable: Anxious Santa Monica apartment owners wonder if 
money will be available for rebuilding as thousands of tenants scattered to the 
winds wonder if they will have a home to return to -- at any price. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, the Rent Board and City Council have enacted, or 
are about to enact, elements of a rebuilding program meant to encourage 
property owners to repair or replace the nearly 2,000 apartments lost in the 
temblor, while retaining affordable housing. The rules have relaxed zoning and, 
to the dismay of renters, may lead to significant rent increases because the 
city has allowed landlords to pass repair costs on to tenants as a permanent 
rent increase. 
</P>
<P>
 For places beyond repair, the City Council agreed to throw its slow-growth 
zoning standards to the wind by allowing new apartment buildings to be the same 
size as before. They don't even have to provide on-site parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is really giving up a lot in order to encourage rebuilding," said 
Planning Director Suzanne Frick. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policies may seem a relaxation of the Rent Board's ironfisted rules 
that helped gain the city the sobriquet Soviet Monica. But landlords do not 
feel they have reaped a bonanza. They question the math of the city's proposals 
and predict rebuilding won't pencil out, even for many of those fortunate 
enough to have that as an option. An unknown number of apartment owners expect 
to lose their buildings to foreclosure because they won't qualify for loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city's dominant rent-control political group is showing signs 
of structural stress, too, its future measured in part by how many of the 
uninhabitable apartment units will be restored -- and when. The units represent 
a small portion of rent-controlled apartments, although in a city in which a 
few hundred votes often decide who is elected to the City Council, each is 
valuable to tenants and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Further clouding the issue is a renewed threat to rent control from 
Sacramento. A bill concerning other rent control issues was amended last week 
in the state Assembly to include a provision that would gut Santa Monica's 
tough tenant regulations by allowing rents to be raised to market levels upon 
vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the future of what is arguably the nation's toughest rent-control 
law, which has remained in place for 15 years despite numerous attempts to 
weaken it. 
</P>
<P>
 The rent control law was adopted following a battle over wildly escalating 
rents in the beach community. The law became the foundation of a political 
dynasty that now holds five of the seven seats on the City Council, controls 
the school board and is essential to the success of state legislators who 
represent the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus it was no easy feat for the Rent Board and the City Council to do what 
does not come naturally for them -- allowing rents to rise in the quake's 
aftermath and wooing landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 The city officials "have a horrible, horrible dilemma," said Steve Little, 
vice president of First Federal Bank, a locally based lender. "They want to put 
as many people back in those buildings as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Scared, angry, aghast at the prospect of higher rents and sad to be away from 
home, the displaced tenants are mostly absent from the dialogue, too 
preoccupied with finding new shelter and getting their belongings from unsafe 
buildings to show up in force at the endless public meetings since the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Their outcry is expected to peak when individual rent increases and the 
permanent loss of units sink in. "Nobody understands the implications of the 
decisions," said renter John Bodin, who ran his political consulting business 
from the now red-tagged Sea Castle, where tenants had an ocean view for as 
little as $500 a month. "The Rent Board may not understand the financial 
ramifications, let alone a displaced tenant." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who did attend a public meeting, longtime renter Sylvia Schniad, 
said she understood only too well that the new regulations were the death knell 
of rent control and "would change for all time the face and the character of 
Santa Monica." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the face of the city was changed on Jan. 17 at 4:31 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has conceded that affordable housing will be lost because of the 
earthquake. The question is how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought 500 affordable units was a fair estimate of what would be 
gone forever, Rent Board attorney Anthony Trendacosta said, "If ultimately, at 
the end of rebuilding, 500 units is all that's lost . . . we've done wonders." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding in Santa Monica is particularly tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of the city the day before the earthquake would have shown a pastiche 
of apartment building styles ranging from the elegant Art Deco of the '20s to 
the slapdash stucco of the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unfettered market, apartment houses wear out and are replaced. But Santa 
Monica's regulations work against that because they invariably favor the status 
quo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Rent Board could keep rents low and be hard-nosed when owners 
wanted to upgrade in exchange for higher rents, it could not force owners to 
maintain their buildings beyond adhering to basic safety codes. And some 
landlords, saying they could hardly make a nickel as it was, did as little as 
possible to keep their places patched together -- and crossed their fingers for 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 For some of these owners and their tenants, the luck ran out when with the 
earthquake, which damaged scores of buildings that were held together by little 
more than spit and glue and rent control. 
</P>
<P>
 All the units put out of commission by the quake were affordable to low- and 
moderate-income people -- the very folks who lost out in the aftermath of the 
Loma Prieta quake in the San Francisco area in 1989. A recent UC Berkeley study 
found that half the apartments lost in that earthquake were not replaced four 
years later. Affordable units were especially vulnerable because, the study 
concluded, government recovery programs favored an ideal victim whose dwelling 
is "adequate, conventional and replicable." Middle-class homeowners fall into 
this category. Poor renters do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Many victims of the Loma Prieta quake, like those in Santa Monica, lived in 
"old, poorly maintained, overcrowded, structurally unsound buildings." When 
study co-author Mary Comerio talks about the marginal economics of older, 
low-rent buildings in the Bay Area, her description could just as easily apply 
to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The study recommends offering more loan money and other incentives to quickly 
restore affordable housing. That is exactly what Santa Monica landlords say is 
missing in the city's plan, although they admit they got many more concessions 
than they might have anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff has made a sincere effort to be fair," said landlord leader Robert 
Sullivan, a property manager. "If the Rent Board had adopted all the staff 
regulations, things would be going a lot smoother." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rent Board met after the quake to set policies, its members knew what 
they had to do, but they would agree to go only so far. 
</P>
<P>
 They realized that a property owner who had to borrow a lot of money to fix up 
a damaged building needed the means to repay the loan. So, over objections of 
tenants who complained that they were being made responsible for the landlord's 
property woes, the board voted to allow provable earthquake repair costs to be 
passed on to tenants through permanent rent increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policies, the landlord's cost of repairs would be amortized over 10 
years, meaning rents in most cases would increase from a few dollars to a few 
hundred dollars. For example, if a landlord spent $100,000 to restore a 10-unit 
building, renters could expect to pay about $83 more per month. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting rents still would be significantly below the rest of the 
Westside rental market. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords would benefit because their property becomes more valuable upon 
resale if rents are high, but they would not make more profit for 10 years 
because of higher mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the urging of the rent control staff, however, the board voted 3 to 2 
not to include replacement of plumbing and electrical systems in the definition 
of earthquake repair -- unless each and every pipe or wire had been damaged by 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners expect this ruling to interfere with their ability to fully 
finance repairs. Banks require the rents of a building to be enough to cover 
the expenses and would insist on the owner replacing worn-out plumbing before 
lending money in the first place. Lenders want the structure to be in as 
tip-top shape as possible, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although landlords bemoan this decision, it is not the biggest obstacle some 
of them face. For those whose buildings cannot be salvaged, the city's 
requirement that all new residential construction include affordable housing 
looms as the biggest stumbling block to rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards require builders of a new apartment structure to set aside 15% 
of the units as affordable housing -- in this case accessible to a family 
earning 80% of the region's median annual income (which for a family of two is 
$30,900). For new condos, 30% of the units must be classified as affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners said such requirements make it difficult to turn a profit or 
even obtain financing for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to do major renovations, they would need loans beyond what banks and 
the Small Business Administration will allow to bridge the funding gap. Some 
have called upon the city to put a bond issue on the ballot to raise loan 
money, but city officials said that will not happen in June. And November, they 
said, might be too late because property owners have to arrange their financing 
in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owner and manager Carl Lambert asked for relief from city officials: 
"The free market built these units and it is going to require the free market 
to rebuild them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, as elsewhere, there is no archetypical landlord. Some people 
have one building bought years ago as a retirement investment. They live there 
and have small mortgage payments, if any. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the folks most likely to rebuild -- if they have the wherewithal for 
a major construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 Others bought their apartment buildings in recent years and have big loans to 
repay and little or no equity because of declining real estate values. They 
might not qualify to borrow enough money to keep afloat and could lose their 
buildings to the bank. Banks would then have the structures repaired or, more 
likely, sell them at a discount to speculators. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fall somewhere in between, their financial situation as unique as a 
snowflake. However, walking away from their buildings or selling them for the 
land value alone (the buildings are worthless in their damaged conditions) 
would mean losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. In fewer cases, borrowing 
repair money may be a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why it is so hard to predict what will happen overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who can get a loan, who I know, is going to rebuild," said landlord 
attorney Rosario Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Property manager Sullivan concurred, saying most owners can't afford to do 
otherwise and are scrambling to obtain financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials fret that owners may wait to see if the rebuilding rules 
are further relaxed months from now, but landlords consider such fears 
unrealistic. Sitting on a property is an option only for those who can make 
their mortgage payments without rent coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably absent from the Rent Board's and City Council's policies has been a 
financial analysis of their impact, which makes it difficult to determine 
whether the guidelines will be effective. Officials said such an analysis would 
be difficult because each owner's financial situation is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a financial analysis, City Councilman Paul Rosenstein said, "We're 
flying in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Asha Greenberg agreed. "We can sit here and make policies until 
the cows come home. That's not going to build us housing." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, city officials can only hope their strategy is the right one.

MARY LAINE YARBER: SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE: WHAT'S A TEACHER TO DO?; MARY LAINE 
YARBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My friend and I recently watched a television news report on a fatal case of 
child abuse. Needless to say, such reports are not uncommon -- and neither is 
the comment that my friend made: "Why aren't teachers involved in spotting and 
reporting child abuse, so that it can't go this far?" 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot explain how a child's suffering can be allowed to continue to the 
point of death. But I can address the responsibility of teachers to report such 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers are often the first (and sometimes the only) people to make law 
enforcement or social service agencies aware of possible child abuse cases, 
whether it be physical, sexual or emotional abuse, or physical neglect. In 
fact, the policies on how teachers should report suspected abuse are strict and 
specific. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers are "mandated reporters." That is, we are required by law to report 
all suspected incidents of child abuse. Teachers have specific guidelines for 
correct reporting, set out in Section 11167 of the Penal Code. For example, we 
must make an immediate telephone report to a child protective service or law 
enforcement agency. Immediate obviously means as soon as possible. But when a 
teacher has no classroom access to a phone, he or she must make the call at 
least by the end of the school day. If a child is being abused at home, it may 
be necessary to prevent him or her from returning there after school. 
</P>
<P>
 The report must include the reporter's name, the name and location of the 
child, the type and extent of the suspected injury, and any other pertinent 
details. There is some degree of confidentiality: The reporter's name may be 
known to the agencies involved in the case and the attorneys who investigate or 
prosecute it. 
</P>
<P>
 My biggest fear in reporting suspected abuse is, "What if I'm wrong?" Again, 
teachers are responsible only for reporting apparent abuse, not for proving it. 
We have no liability for a report that proves to be unfounded, and can't be 
fired for it. But here's the crux: The law allows an accused parent or other 
party to sue a teacher who reports abuse that is later proven to have been 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 While hefty lawyers' fees and gut-wrenching litigation make this a frightening 
prospect, the law does provide some help for a teacher headed for court: The 
state pays up to $50,000 of legal fees if the teacher wins the case. The bad 
news, of course, is that the teacher must pay the fees, then wait to be 
reimbursed.  
</P>
<P>
 If the whole process of reporting seems too bothersome or tenuous, consider 
the alternative. A teacher who suspects child abuse but does not report it is 
guilty of a misdemeanor, and could be sentenced to up to six months in county 
jail, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, however, the ultimate punishment for a negligent teacher is the 
possibility that, as a result of such negligence, a child may some day suffer 
the same fate as the youngster who was the subject of the news report I watched 
the other night.

OUT AND ABOUT / BABY DEJA-VU: RECYCLING WEARABLE WARES FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Newborns, sadly, arrive unclothed. But if Mom and Dad are lucky, a supply of 
hand-me-down baby duds soon pour in from relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 If the supply is still lacking, however, a Los Angeles store stands prepared 
to fill the void. Baby Deja-Vu specializes in cute, cuddly hand-me-downs at 
bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop's ever-changing selection of merchandise includes an assortment of 
used baby clothing, maternity wear, furniture, toys, books and accessories. 
Sizes are available in newborn to children's size 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any age is a good age to come in here," Nan Ellin, a mother and Park La Brea 
resident, said last week during a visit to the store. "You don't want to invest 
a lot because they grow so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Store owners Jon and Veronique Weisbart take items on consignment and sell 
them, giving the consignor -- often parents -- a percentage of the sale price. 
Consignment goods are accepted during business hours and must be in good 
condition, free of stains, freshly cleaned and ironed. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby Deja-Vu helps consignors because they feel that they are recycling 
something useful, not simply throwing it in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers of the consigned goods are not limited to parents. Grandparents, 
aunts and uncles buy car seats, cradles and other items to accommodate visiting 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 When Baby Deja-Vu opened six months ago, there were only 200 items. Today, 
there are more than 5,000. Though some of the merchandise is new, the vast 
majority is collected through consignments. Prices range from 50 cents to $70, 
depending on the item. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prices are better and there are more interesting clothes in terms of 
selection," said Jon Weisbart. 
</P>
<P>
 The store is also child-friendly, with a play area that has a table, chairs 
and crayons so parents can shop in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby Deja-Vu, 8311 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles. (213) 653-2181. Hours are 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. CHRISTINA V. GODBEY

REGIONAL REPORT; COMMUNITIES COMPETING FOR $100 MILLION IN FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A multimillion-dollar federal empowerment zone that would promote economic 
development in Los Angeles will likely be carved into several portions, and 
communities across the city are already jockeying for their piece. 
</P>
<P>
 With its combination of $100 million for social programs and tax incentives 
for businesses in poor areas, the empowerment zone will be the most significant 
federal community-development program in more than 20 years. Although the 
economic effects could be diluted, council members and other city officials 
have said the zone will likely be broken into three pieces, which is permitted 
under federal regulations so long as half the census tracts have poverty rates 
of 35% or more and the total population does not exceed 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how it is carved up, the 20-square-mile zone will still exclude an 
overwhelming majority of the eligible areas covering 80 square miles in Los 
Angeles. And as a May 15 deadline approaches for the City Council to prepare a 
draft report on which communities will benefit, the battles among competing 
interests have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it won't get too ugly," said Reynold Blight, director of state 
enterprise zone programs for the city's Community Development Department.  
</P>
<P>
 A preview of the competition came during a March 3 council hearing, when 
groups from Watts to Boyle Heights and from Wilmington to Pacoima argued to be 
part of the zone. The hearing was held in advance of a Community Development 
Department report expected to be given this week to the council. That report 
will recommend the areas to be included in the city's application to the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, which must be turned in by June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all fighting for this piece of pie, and I don't know if there is enough 
money to satisfy us all," said Richard Marshall, a member of the Community 
Advisory Council to the 9th Council District in South-Central. He was among 
about 120 people at the hearing of the council's Community and Economic 
Development Committee and the Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee, 
which will recommend zone locations to the full council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been neglected worse than any of these other poverty areas in the 
city," Marshall told council members, arguing for a zone along Central Avenue 
from 5th Street to Slauson Avenue. "I feel we deserve special consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 But the same argument is being made by advocates of a zone on the Eastside, 
who say the only infrastructure development in their area has been the 
construction of freeways that have broken up the neighborhoods of Boyle 
Heights, El Sereno and Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're lobbying for our future," said Frank Villalobos, president of Barrio 
Planners Inc., one of 19 community groups representing the Eastside at the 
March 3 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 groups presented an economic study identifying a five-square-mile area 
with 33,000 residents for consideration as part of the zone. Villalobos said 
the area includes the industrial section of Boyle Heights and runs along the 
Los Angeles River near several freeways and railroad lines, which makes it well 
suited for economic development. The area is also part of a state enterprise 
zone, which provides state tax breaks to businesses within its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same argument is being made by the Los Angeles Community Empowerment 
Collaborative, a coalition of more than 40 community and business organizations 
near USC that formed in November to push for inclusion in the federal program. 
The group wants a portion of the empowerment zone to overlap the city's 
four-square-mile Central City state enterprise zone near USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report submitted to the council, Central City advocates say their area's 
per capita income of $5,407 is the lowest of the city's five state enterprise 
zones and cite the area's proximity to the university and its existing 
industrial and transportation infrastructure as major advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our area has strong economic development potential and many community-based 
organizations," said Ezekiel Mobley, executive director of the Central City 
South Assn. of Commerce and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal empowerment zone program, the city would be allowed to spend 
the $100 million for programs ranging from child care to job training. Also, 
businesses in the zone will be eligible to receive a host of tax incentives. 
They include payroll tax breaks of up to 20% of the wages of workers who live 
in the zone and accelerated depreciation of equipment, allowing owners to write 
off equipment as a tax loss as soon as it is purchased instead of the normal 
five- to seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, hoping to use Los Angeles as a model for its urban 
agenda, has said the city is virtually assured of receiving one of the zones. 
Los Angeles officials have said they also plan to apply for several of the 65 
HUD-designated urban "enterprise communities" that will receive $3 million each 
in assistance. ROBERT J. LOPEZ

REGION; HAWTHORNE; TAGGERS BECOME FOCUS OF ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Law enforcement: Community activists plan to use special hidden cameras to 
catch graffiti vandals red-handed. The evidence will be turned over to police 
for action. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti taggers in Hawthorne may earn some unwanted notoriety next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists plan to use hidden cameras to catch the vandals 
red-handed. Volunteers armed with low-light, high-resolution cameras from the 
city's cable operation will begin staking out some of Hawthorne's most heavily 
vandalized areas in early April. Participants in the program, patterned after a 
similar effort in Lomita, will not accost the taggers but report them to the 
police by cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to nab a few graffiti taggers and help them change their ways, 
whether they want to or not," said Albert Wise, a chief organizer of the plan 
and a member of the city's Graffiti and Gang Abatement Commission. "But more 
than anything, we want them to not tag in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Taggers who are caught will have to pay for removal of the graffiti, city 
officials said. If the offender is under 18 and caught between 10 p.m. and 
sunrise, his or her parents could be fined $2,500 under the city's curfew law. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, young taggers could be placed in a counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to see this be more of a redemptive program than a punitive 
one," said Wise, who often deals with troubled children in his work as pastor 
of the Del Aire Assembly of God Church in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne spends about $150,000 a year cleaning up graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can take the graffiti off the walls all day long, but if we don't give 
these kids a reason to stop, they won't," said Steve Hanna, who supervises the 
city's six full-time graffiti removal workers. 
</P>
<P>
 City crews respond to about 500 calls each week, often returning twice in the 
same day to hot spots along Hawthorne Boulevard and Prairie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when we go out to clean up a wall, the kids will sit there and tell 
us that they're just going to put the graffiti back up when we leave," Hanna 
said. "They're very bold about it. Maybe the cameras will make them a little 
less bold." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the undercover program hope to emulate the success of their 
counterparts in Lomita, who have used hidden surveillance cameras since early 
1993 to reduce graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hawthorne and many South Bay cities, Lomita has grappled with a rise in 
vandalism over the past five years, said Don Turman, chairman of the Lomita 
Gangs and Graffiti Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of last year, most South Bay cities had passed ordinances 
prohibiting the sale of spray-paint cans to minors and many had set up 
graffiti-reporting hot lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Lomita's attempt to photograph and identify taggers has been an especially 
effective deterrent, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Christine Villarreal, Lomita's building and safety officer, said the amount of 
graffiti citywide has declined dramatically. In 1991, she would spend half of 
her time issuing notices to homeowners and businesses to clean up graffiti. 
Today, she spends only about a fifth of her time doing so, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said it has arrested at least two 
taggers as a direct result of the surveillance program.  
</P>
<P>
 "The cameras have stopped a lot of the problems, but not all of them," Turman 
said. "Nothing's going to stop graffiti completely." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Hawthorne and Lomita emphasize that the hidden cameras are not a 
cure-all and don't address what they consider to be the root of the graffiti 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to give kids something better to do with their lives," said Tom 
Quintana, secretary for the Hawthorne Gang and Graffiti Abatement Commission. 
"Some of these kids have some real artistic talent, but they need to find a 
more productive way to express themselves." SCOTT SANDELL

 FINAL PEP TALK 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Hills basketball Coach John Bobich has run out of pep talks to give 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobich has told his players that "this is the biggest game of the year" for 
the past eight games. And the pep talk has worked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (24-9), who barely qualified for the Southern Section playoffs as 
the fourth-place team in the Delphic League, will play Ripon Christian (34-1) 
Saturday in the State Division V championship game at the Oakland Coliseum. 
They qualified for their second state final appearance, beating Immanuel of 
Reedley, 74-51, in the Southern California Regional final Saturday at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened all so quickly," Bobich said. "We struggled to make the playoffs 
and I told the players we need this game and they continue to step up. The 
whole team is in a zone." 
</P>
<P>
 So now that the Bruins are in the state final, what is Bobich going to tell 
his players? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the state finals are self-motivating," he said. "I don't think I have 
to say too much." 
</P>
<P>
 One player who really has improved his game is 6-foot-4 forward Danny Brummel. 
</P>
<P>
 Brummel made an off-balance 10-foot bank shot at the buzzer to beat North 
Hollywood Campbell Hall, 44-42, in the Southern California Regional semifinals 
Thursday at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 Brummel, who is averaging 21 points in the playoffs, scored a game-high 27 
points against Reedley. He made 12 of 14 shots, including two three-point 
baskets, as the Bruins shot 77% from the field. FRIAR ON THE RISE 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Smith is the top player for Providence, but his successor may be a 
6-foot-9 forward from Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin Croshere, The Times' 1992 Westside player of the year, has made 
important contributions as a reserve for Providence. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep an eye out for Croshere when the Friars (20-9) play Alabama (19-9) 
tonight in the NCAA Southeast Regional at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Croshere had 10 points and six rebounds in nine minutes to help the 
Friars beat Villanova in the Big East tournament quarterfinals at Madison 
Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was the Friars' hero with 25 points and 12 rebounds, but Croshere played 
a key role off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 In his college debut, Croshere had 23 points against Brown. JUSTICE SERVED 
</P>
<P>
 File this under "It pays to complain." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Feb. 3 article, The Times Westside Section reported that Westchester 
quarterback Seka Edwards had not received a scholarship offer despite his 
impressive high school credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, a two-time Times' Westside offensive back of the year, passed for 
2,053 yards and 28 touchdowns last season to help the Comets advance to the 
City Section 4-A Division semifinals. He passed for 3,599 yards and 52 
touchdowns in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In the article, it was reported that recruiters considered the 6-1, 170-pound 
Edwards too small to play college football. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Comet Coach Larry Wein, a Lehigh graduate saw the article and 
called the football coaches at his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their quarterback had graduated and he knew his school was still looking for 
a replacement," Wein said. "He called to tell the coaches that Edwards was 
available. That story started the whole process." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Edwards accepted a scholarship to play football for Lehigh. 
FAMILIAR LOOK 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Bernard girls' basketball team will try to win its second consecutive 
State Division IV-A title Friday at the Oakland Coliseum. The Vikings will play 
Grass Valley Bear River in a rematch of last season's title game, which they 
won, 59-48. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympia Scott had 25 points and 19 rebounds as the Vikings (28-5) beat Santa 
Ynez, 54-41, to win the Southern California Regional on Saturday at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. The Vikings also beat Santa Ynez, 52-39, to win the Southern 
Section Division IV-AA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're playing the same teams, each game gets tougher and 
tougher," St. Bernard Coach Lori Pawinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, a 6-foot-2 senior who will attend Stanford in the fall, was one of two 
players from California selected to play in the third annual Kodak Girls' High 
School All-America game, April 18, in Jackson, Tenn. The game features the top 
20 high school players in the nation and will be televised by Prime Network and 
its affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, The Times' 1993 Westside player of the year, has averaged 17.7 points 
and 14.8 rebounds for the Vikings. In last season's state final against Bear 
River, Scott had 24 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's one of the best players in the nation and she deserves this 
recognition," Pawinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Erickson of Brea-Olinda was the other California player selected to 
play in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Timicha Kirby of Lynwood and Mimi McKinney of Peninsula were selected to the 
Kodak honorable mention team. HALL OF FAMER 
</P>
<P>
 Charley Sands, West Los Angeles College's first and only basketball coach, 
received a special 60th birthday present when he was inducted into the 
Community College Basketball Hall of Fame on March 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Sands was honored with San Diego Mesa Coach Jau Mulvehal and former players 
John Block (Glendale College, USC), Mack Calvin (Long Beach College, USC), Swen 
Nater (Cypress College, UCLA), and John Vallely (Orange Coast College, UCLA) 
during the first day of the state tournament at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sands, the Oiler coach since the school opened in 1968, has a record of 
289-373. The Oilers, who had only one sophomore on the roster, were 6-21 and 
0-10 in the Western State Conference this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers have played their home games off-campus for 25 years at locations

 "I wanted to coach at West Los Angeles College because of its location," said 
Sands, who coached at Fairfax High before taking the Oiler job. "It struck me 
as a great opportunity. I certainly have no regrets. We have a built a program 
and had some fine players. I am particularly happy for helping to develop some 
kids who did not play in high school. Many of our guys went on to four-year 
colleges." COMMUNITY COLLEGES

 GREEN & WHITE: Today is St. Patrick's Day (OC Live!), and one of the county's 
more distinguished sons of Ireland will spend it supping at the White House. 
The occasion is a state dinner for Ireland's prime minister, but Thomas 
Keneally will probably spend some time chatting with the Clintons about 
"Schindler's List," the hit movie based on his Holocaust book. . . . Keneally 
is Australian, you say? Yes, but friends at UC Irvine, where he's on the 
writing faculty, say he's proud of his Irish heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 GREAT REFUND: Maybe you'd like to have the same tax person that handles the 
Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District. For five years it's been trying 
to give to the Internal Revenue Service $117,543 it says it owes in taxes. But 
the IRS doesn't want it. "We kept telling them we owed the money and the IRS 
insisted we didn't," says Assistant Supt. Kim Stallings. The district has 
decided to give up trying. . . . Strangely, nobody seems to remember now what 
the amount was for. "It was before my time," Stallings says. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE BETS: If discussions get too heated at Santa Ana Unified School Board 
meetings, president Sal Mendoza has a tension breaker: He somehow works the 
conversation around to his days on the Santa Ana High School track team, and 
how his record for running the mile -- 4 minutes, 15 seconds -- still holds. 
It's the 30th anniversary of Mendoza's school record, and he says "I never 
dreamed" it would hold up this long. . . . Mendoza's betting it won't last 
another 30 years. He's wrong: High schools no longer run the mile; they run 
1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR RUSSIA WITH LOVE: Another step toward better relations between the United 
States and Russia: Maybe you haven't heard of 20-year-old Tapiana Lebedeva, who 
stars on the Russian ski team. She missed the Winter Olympics with a bad right 
knee. But, while practicing in California, the Russian team brought her to the 
sports medicine division of Anaheim Memorial Hospital. Surgery, provided free 
as goodwill, is scheduled for this morning.

 VALLEY IRISH: A lot of eyes must be smiling in Burbank today. It's St. Paddy's 
Day, of course, and Burbank carries the largest contingent -- 3.6% -- of Valley 
folks with heavy Irish ancestry (above). . . . In all, according to the 1990 U. 
S. Census, 49,124 residents (2.6%) identified Irish as their main lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 SHUTTLE CHECK: Certainly, if you're going to fly into space, it's probably a 
good idea to check out your vehicle ahead of time. Which is exactly what 
happened Wednesday when the six-member crew that will fly on the modified 
Atlantis shuttle visited Palmdale. . . . The timing was perfect. NASA said 
Tuesday that major shuttle adjustments will continue to be done by Rockwell 
International in Palmdale. (B18) 
</P>
<P>
 VERSATILE TEEN: Sure, maybe he's no Bo Jackson or Deion Sanders, but 
Harvard-Westlake High senior Matt Sebree is a pretty impressive player in two 
sports -- football and volleyball. . . . Already, Notre Dame, Penn State and 
USC have shown interest in his kicking skills while the top volleyball schools 
want him too. (C12) 
</P>
<P>
 EARLY AMBITION: Speaking of talented teens, check out UCLA freshman Josh Arce, 
18. Arce, a Democrat, hopes this fall to dethrone Republican Paula Boland in 
the 38th Assembly District, covering the northwestern Valley. . . . So what if 
his campaign budget is only $150? So what if his own grandmother, a staunch 
Republican, wouldn't lend him money? "You can't win the game if you don't step 
out on the field," he said. (B5) 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL HEROES: March Madness gets under way this week, and you can bet the 
Valley will have a say in the outcome of the college basketball tournaments. . 
. . For the men, the Valley alumni include UCLA's Marquis Burns, New Mexico 
State's D. J. Jackson and Pepperdine's Dana Jones. The women come from Hart 
High in Newhall -- Oregon State's Anjanette Dionne and Oregon's Sara Wilson. 
Where the Irish Are 
</P>
<P>
 Only 2.6% of Valley residents claim Irish as their main ancestry. Communities 
with the largest percentage of Irish residents: Burbank: 3.6% Sherman 
Oaks-Studio City*: 3.4% Sunland-Tujunga: 3.0% Chatsworth-Porter Ranch: 2.8% 
Reseda-West Van Nuys: 2.8% * Includes Toluca Lake

SAUDIS, IRANIANS AT ODDS OVER OIL PRICES, PILGRIMAGE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran took a turn for the worse Wednesday 
when Saudi Arabia reacted sharply to criticism by Iran's spiritual leader, 
suggesting new tension between the two Persian Gulf oil giants. 
</P>
<P>
 In an official statement, Saudi Arabia accused Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei 
of irresponsibility for charging that Saudi Arabia was hindering Iranians' 
pilgrimage to Muslim holy sites in the kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the new war of words could mark the end of a period of cool but 
correct relations between the two neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 They attributed the current tension to the failure of the two nations to agree 
on how to maintain stability in the region and how to shore up weak world oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest dispute, over how many Iranians should be allowed to attend this 
year's pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, came amid signs that Riyadh is losing 
patience with Tehran's apparent inability to deliver on promises of political 
moderation. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia believes radicals are undermining the pragmatism promised by 
President Hashemi Rafsanjani. Riyadh also believes Iran is meddling in its 
neighbors' affairs and supporting Muslim fundamentalists in Arab countries such 
as Algeria, Egypt and Sudan.

STATE PROBE FINDS 370,000-GALLON TOXIC SPILL; ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS SAY OIL 
BYPRODUCT LEAKED FROM A RUPTURED TEXACO PIPELINE NEAR SCHOOL CANYON ROAD NORTH 
OF VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS and SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A yearlong investigation by state officials has uncovered a 370,000-gallon 
leak of a toxic oil byproduct, a spill believed to be among the largest 
oil-related accidents in Ventura County history, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the state Department of Fish and Game said they believe that 
gas condensate -- a byproduct that occurs when oil is converted into gasoline 
-- leaked from a ruptured Texaco pipeline near School Canyon Road near the 
company's Ventura County headquarters. The spill was first reported as a minor 
accident in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the state and the Ventura County district attorney's office 
obtained a search warrant this week in an effort to find out how quickly Texaco 
reported the leak and what was done to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the spill north of Ventura is believed to be far larger than 
the Jan. 17 spill of 215,000 gallons of crude into the Santa Clara River and a 
spill of 84,000 gallons of oil into a lake near McGrath State Beach that was 
discovered at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators said they do not yet know how much of the 370,000 gallons 
has leaked into School Canyon Creek, a seasonally dry stream that feeds into 
the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe that much of the gas condensate may still be contained within a 
small area of soil in the canyon. No dead or injured wildlife has been found, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guess is that (the spill) lay dormant for some time," said Reed Smith, a 
pollution response coordinator for Fish and Game. "Then, with the high rains 
last year, it was carried to the surface of School Canyon Creek and into the 
Ventura River." 
</P>
<P>
 After Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark issued the search warrant Monday, nearly 
30 investigators spent Tuesday and Wednesday sifting through records at Texaco 
U.S.A.'s exploration and production area headquarters at 2692 N. Ventura Ave., 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their search of a dozen buildings was scheduled to resume this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Brose said investigators are looking for evidence 
of two possible felony violations relating to the discharge of hazardous 
substances into waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fish and Game worked on this for about a year and finally came to the 
conclusion that there was evidence indicating a potential for a felony 
violation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could be individual liability on the part of individual employees," 
Brose said. "There could be liability on the part of Texaco. Or there could be 
no liability." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Texaco said the company reported the spill promptly to state 
authorities and has "cooperated fully" in trying to clean up the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dismayed by the D. A.'s and Fish and Game's action, but are 
cooperating fully with the investigation," Texaco spokeswoman Faye Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said company officials are not convinced that Texaco was the source of the 
spill, but a state investigator said an analysis of the toxic substance showed 
that it did come from the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that the spill occurred when a pipeline on the company's 
property ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
 After analyzing the spill, state investigators and a private consulting firm 
concluded that about 8,800 barrels of gas condensate seeped into a hillside 
before oozing into the creek, Fish and Game Capt. Roger Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the investigation began, he said, Texaco officials have "repeatedly 
denied previous knowledge of any spill in School Canyon" or of possessing any 
records related to pipelines in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the department found a repaired pipeline, which we believe is the 
probable source of the spill, Texaco denied knowledge of any repair or records 
of repairs to that pipeline," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said information on the leak was not released earlier because 
investigations by Fish and Game are kept confidential until the district 
attorney's office is contacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game officials said the spill is still being cleaned up and crews are 
pumping contaminated ground water from wells at the site.

CASHING IN ON A HOBBY; UNEMPLOYED COLLECTOR IS FORCED TO SELL OLD CITRUS LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fantastic images in vibrant colors covered the Santa Paula kitchen table. 
Pictures of elephants named Jumbo, of clusters of just-picked pansies, of 
mountainscapes and riverscapes and scowling Native Americans with long black 
braids hanging over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 And on each 12-by-12-inch piece of paper, in the lower left corner, was 
painted a small orange or lemon stamped "Sunkist." 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at these; aren't they beautiful?" marveled Joe Morales, owner of the 
citrus packing labels, waving his arms over the display. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, until just after World War II, citrus packinghouses used to paste 
such cheery paper art pieces on their wooden fruit crates, hoping to entice 
customers back east with tantalizing snatches of sunny, exotic California. 
Today, with the packinghouses stamping their corporate logos on cardboard 
boxes, the labels have become valuable collector's pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales, an out-of-work packinghouse foreman, began his love affair with 
labels in the late '50s, when he spotted some extras in a packinghouse back 
room. Over the years, his collection -- all of which he picked up for free or 
traded for -- grew to more than 3,000. He says their fanciful images take him 
to other worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's a pitcher got to do with lemons?" Morales asked, picking up a label 
depicting a serving pitcher and holding it up for inspection. "What's a silver 
cord got to do with oranges? Nothing -- they used beauty to attract business." 
</P>
<P>
 When Morales started his collection some 30-odd years ago, he figured that 
someday it would be worth something. He never stopped to figure how much 
because, in his heart, he never really planned to sell them. A few weeks ago, 
however, he realized that it was time to put some on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he lost his job in the Central Valley town of Ivanhoe in early 1991, 
laid off with nearly every other employee at the packinghouse following a 
devastating December freeze, Morales, 57, can't find a job anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, Morales, who grew up around Santa Paula, came home to live 
with his mother and look for a job in Ventura County. Although he still 
receives partial retirement from Sunkist, part of his $250 monthly pension goes 
to his two children, Joe Jr., 6, and Sonya, 4, who live with his ex-wife in 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 With his finances getting extremely pinched, Morales sat down at the kitchen 
table this month and penned an ad to run in the local paper, announcing a 
citrus label collection up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to sell them; I really hate to sell them," he said. "It hurts me." 
</P>
<P>
 But the extra money helps. The $60 a collector shelled out the other day for 
one of Morales' favorite sets of three covered his life insurance payment and 
gave him money left over to pay for gas, so he can drive around and look for 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this label," Morales told a visitor, gesturing to one covered in a 
bright Scotch plaid and adorned with the image of a pink-cheeked girl named 
"Annie Laurie" reclining on white flowers. "I don't know why, exactly. I just 
like to sit down and admire it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagerly, he reached over to grasp another colored piece depicting a folded 
pink fabric swatch. "Look at this -- 'Satin.' Now watch this." Morales pulled 
out the other labels in the set from the plastic envelopes where he stores 
them. "You've got 'Satin,' 'Velvet,' 'Linen.' "  
</P>
<P>
 He smiled. "I get all excited when I play around with these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Each label represents a different brand of oranges sold by the packinghouses 
and, as with any collector's item, the labels are priced both for their 
scarcity and their trendiness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Taafe, a Manhattan Beach resident and second vice president of the 
200-member Citrus Label Society, can rattle off label values like baseball fans 
tick off their favorite players' batting statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one called 'I Grow These Myself,' showing Uncle Sam wearing a top hat 
and tails and holding a bunch of oranges," Taafe said. "It's from 1898 and 
there's only 12 known to exist. The last one that sold went for approximately 
$1,500." 
</P>
<P>
 Taafe is familiar with Santa Paula packinghouse labels. Some, like one 
depicting Santa Claus, are fairly common. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the blond senorita, the Santa, of course, and others were 
'Endurance,' with a picture of a camel, and another one, 'Strength,' " he said. 
"Right now, a label like 'Endurance' or 'Strength,' it'll go for anywhere from 
$20 to $25." 
</P>
<P>
 The fanciful pictures were supposed to equate oranges in grocers' minds with 
freshness and the legendary paradise that others in colder climes assumed was 
California, said Nicholas Couley, Claremont-based owner of an advertising 
agency that markets citrus label reproductions.

 "People would have visions of palm trees and sun and skies and blue," he said. 
"They would say, 'Oh, I wish I was there.' And it was like, 'Well, you can't be 
there, but look at these labels.' And the labels would also make people think, 
'Oh, these oranges must be really good for us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Couley said the crates went out of use near the end of World War II, when wood 
was scarce and expensive. Packinghouses looking for a cheaper option switched 
to corrugated cardboard with the label stamped on the side, and have stayed 
with that method ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the labels were free for the taking, lying pell-mell in 
packinghouse storerooms and, in the minds of many packinghouse managers, taking 
up precious space. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Creason, president and general manager of the Fillmore-Piru Citrus 
Assn., and himself an avid collector with more than 4,000 labels, said local 
packinghouses found them so cumbersome that they buried piles of them along the 
bank of the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were too bulky to burn," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Creason went out to the riverbed recently to dig the labels up, but they had 
molded beyond restoration, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, collectors say, packinghouses keep their collections in vaults. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors often buy special, photo-album-type volumes in which to store the 
thin, fragile labels. But Morales can't afford the albums, so he substitutes 
with clear plastic envelopes that he tapes up until they are the right size. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of Morales' thousands of labels, dating back as far as 1918, are in 
excellent condition. The colors are bright and hardly a corner is creased. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day I just said, 'You know, mom, I need the money,' " he said. "I need a 
car to look for jobs. I've just got to get rid of some of these things."

PANEL PICKS OFFICE PROJECT FOR PARCEL IN VENTURA; DEVELOPMENT: OFFICIALS REJECT 
HOUSING PLAN FOR DOWNTOWN SITE, RECOMMEND NEGOTIATIONS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL 
CONSULTING FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A committee of Ventura city officials Wednesday rejected a plan to build a 
housing project on city-owned property downtown, recommending instead that a 
Victorian-style office development be constructed on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Economic Opportunity and Revitalization Committee decided that the 
City Council should begin negotiations with Holguin, Fahan & Associates, a 
Ventura environmental consulting company that wants to build a 
10,000-square-foot office building and warehouse at the northwest corner of 
Figueroa Street and Thompson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff recommended the office project to the committee. "We felt that in 
terms of design and scale, the office project would fit better with the office 
buildings on the west side," Associate City Planner Pat Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-member committee is made up of City Council members Gregory L. 
Carson, Gary Tuttle and Rosa Lee Measures. The committee, which oversees many 
of the city's business interests, reviewed the development proposals because 
they involve property the city owns. 
</P>
<P>
 The project must now be reviewed by the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee rejected a proposal by Oxnard developer Ted Price, who wants to 
build 26 townhouses and shops on the site. Council members said they liked 
Price's project and directed city staff to help him find another location 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, who chairs the committee, noted that for years, few developers had 
been interested in the 25,900-square-foot vacant lot. A water moratorium 
restricted building for a few years, and the recession has also discouraged 
some entrepreneurs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have two proposals to choose from," Carson said after the meeting. 
"I'm thrilled that people are willing to invest dollars in downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Holguin, an owner of the environmental consulting company, estimated 
that the project would cost as much as $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 If the committee had not recommended his project, Holguin said, "we would have 
been forced to move outside the city to find a desirable location." 
</P>
<P>
 His company, which specializes in evaluating contaminated sites and hazardous 
wastes, has an office in east Ventura and one on Figueroa Street, down the 
block from the city-owned parcel. The two offices would be consolidated in this 
project, which calls for about 6,000 square feet of office space, 2,000 square 
feet for a laboratory and 1,000 square feet for a warehouse. A small parking 
lot with about 30 spaces would also be built to the rear of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin also plans to add some commercial space in the complex to lease to a 
small cafe. The design of the building is reminiscent of a Victorian hotel, 
with porches and planters. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will now begin negotiating with Holguin on the price of the 
land and other concessions that Holguin is seeking, such as waiving traffic 
mitigation fees and low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin said he thinks that the city's appraised value of $310,000 is a little 
high. The city purchased the vacant lot for $312,000 in 1989, at the height of 
the real estate boom, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now its value has only gone down to $310,000," he said. "I wish my house had 
kept its value like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said city officials have no asking price for the land yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of surprised when it came in at $310,000," he said. "We just 
want to sell it at fair market value. We understand the price of land has gone 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Planning Commission approves the project, Holguin said construction 
could start within three months, and his company could move into its new 
quarters in mid-1995.

BILL WOULD BENEFIT FAMILIES OF SLAIN STATE EMPLOYEES; LEGISLATION: MEASURE 
WOULD GIVE LIFETIME FINANCIAL AID TO VICTIMS' LOVED ONES. BUT PROPOSAL IS 
CRITICIZED AS TOO COSTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The families of two state workers killed during a shooting rampage at an 
unemployment office in Oxnard in December would receive lifetime benefits under 
legislation proposed by state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, however, is already drawing criticism from local taxpayer 
advocates, who say they appreciate the sentiment but believe that it would be 
too costly for a state already mired in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful idea," said Lindsay Nielson, president of the Ventura County 
Taxpayers Assn. "But I don't think we can afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 The families of Phillip Villegas, 43, of Oxnard and Anna Velasco, 42, of 
Fillmore would be among the first recipients of the lifetime benefits if Hart's 
bill is passed. Villegas and Velasco were killed Dec. 2 when a gunman entered 
the Oxnard office of the state Employment Development Department and began 
shooting at employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said his bill would give families of all state employees killed by acts 
of violence in the workplace benefits comparable to those received by families 
of state law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed legislation calls for the surviving spouse to receive 75% of the 
victim's salary for life -- rather than six months -- even if that person 
remarries. If the only survivor is a child, the benefit would continue until 
the child reaches age 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Clemence, executive director of the Ventura County Alliance of Taxpayers, 
said Hart's bill is flawed because it doesn't even consider whether a victim's 
spouse is financially needy. He also questioned the rationale of providing 
lifetime benefits to a surviving spouse, particularly one young in age, who 
chooses to remarry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a grab bag of goodies that we're offering government employees at a 
time when we can't provide enough police officers on the street," Clemence 
said. "I have the utmost sympathy for people in this situation, but reason must 
reign." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Clemence and Nielson, however, said they support special death benefits 
for public safety officers because of the dangerous nature of their job. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart defended his bill, saying, "I don't see why state employees should be 
treated any different than public safety officers. . . . I think it's a false 
distinction. With the way things are, many of the jobs of state employees are 
becoming more hazardous." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that death benefits provided to the families of public safety 
officers are also not based on the marital or financial status of the surviving 
spouse. "I don't think we want (the government) to get into making those kinds 
of decisions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator said the cost of the death benefits would be minimal. "We're 
looking at maybe $100,000 a year (paid out in benefits) in a state with an 
$80-billion budget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's aide, Jose Sigala, added that in eight years, only five families, 
including those of the two state employees killed in Oxnard, would have 
qualified to receive the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based upon recent history, this is not a significant expenditure," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is scheduled to be reviewed by the Legislature's Public Employees 
Retirement System Committee on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart is asking that the bill be made retroactive to July, 1993, to compensate 
the families of Villegas and Velasco. Villegas is survived by his wife, Karen, 
43, and their two children, Lisa and Phillip Jr. Velasco is survived by her 
husband, Salvador, 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Villegas and Salvador Velasco could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Velasco's brother, Carlos Vargas, said he has not had time to consider 
Hart's bill or how it might benefit his brother-in-law Salvador, who is 
employed as a forklift operator at a Fillmore packinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is always a help," Vargas said. "But it doesn't matter what amount of 
money they give you, it won't bring that person back." 
</P>
<P>
 Also killed during the shooting spree at the Oxnard unemployment office were 
jobs counselor Richard Bateman of Ventura and Oxnard Police Detective James E. 
O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunman Alan Winterbourne was shot to death by police after a chase that led to 
the unemployment office in Ventura.

WEST VALLEY COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fillmore man who told authorities he is infected with the virus believed to 
cause AIDS pleaded not guilty Wednesday to an assault charge stemming from an 
incident in which he allegedly scratched, punched and attempted to bite an 
emergency room physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Bail was set at $25,000 in Newhall Municipal Court for David Detoth, 45, 
charged with assaulting a doctor Saturday night during a visit to the emergency 
room at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital.A preliminary hearing is scheduled 
for March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Detoth declined a request by the district attorney to submit to an HIV test, 
though he allegedly bragged that "I've been HIV since 1983" after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said if Detoth continues to refuse, a judge could order him to be 
tested if there is sufficient evidence that bodily fluids were exchanged during 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 If he tests positive for the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, he could face an additional charge of assault with the intent to do 
great bodily injury, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Damon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney John Ponist told Judge H. Keith Byram that Detoth says he has 
cancer over much of his body and suffers from bleeding in his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponist said outside the courtroom that the weekend attack may have been 
related to medication the defendant was taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the attack occurred about 9:50 p.m. after Detoth was brought 
to the hospital in pain by a friend. He became enraged when hospital staff 
members refused to give him pain killers and allegedly attacked a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon said there is concern for the well-being of the doctor, whose identity 
was not released. SCOTT GLOVER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HUD TO RECONSIDER WAITING-LIST EDICT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the request of local politicians, federal housing officials will reconsider 
an edict that merged individual cities' public housing waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo and Ojai had protested the 
federal decision to combine lengthy waiting lists for subsidized housing.The 
merger bumped some people from the top of an individual city's list to near the 
bottom of the combined countywide list. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous letters, federal officials had insisted on carrying out the 
merger, a move that infuriated local politicians and public housing advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday, swayed by an intense lobbying effort, the federal government's 
assistant secretary of housing and urban development said she would reconsider 
the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of federal officials will visit Ventura County in the next month to 
review the issue and will consider reinstating geographically based waiting 
lists, Thousand Oaks City Manager Grant Brimhall said from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good news," said Olav Hassel, housing services manager for Thousand 
Oaks. "This is a totally different approach (for federal officials) -- it's 
constructive, cooperative and creative. It gives us a tremendous amount of 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
 If the government follows through with separating the waiting lists, Hassel 
said, "that means the new public housing project we're building on Hillcrest 
Drive (near Hodencamp Road) will be specifically for our own residents." 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for the federal officials' visit, city staff will draw up a map 
showing the geographic barriers -- including mountains, rivers and narrow roads 
-- that might make it difficult for residents working in one city to move into 
public housing in another. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Henry Johansson had never seen anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant, mechanical arm reached out and snatched the green garbage can, 
easily lifting it in the air and shaking its contents into the rear of an 
Oxnard trash truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard of such a thing in my country," said Johansson, a Swedish 
environmentalist watching the state-of-the-art trash trucks in action 
Wednesday. "It appears much more efficient than the way we do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish environmental officials were in Oxnard to learn about the city's trash 
collection and recycling programs. The daylong tour was part of a weeklong 
review of environmental programs statewide by the nine-member delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweden is a small country," said Pontus Gronvall, spokesman for the group of 
professors, environmental advocates and government officials. "That's why it 
was important for us to come to a smaller city to see what you do and see what 
we can relate to." 
</P>
<P>
 They saw worms feeding on rotting trash and turning it into compost. They 
inspected Oxnard's automated garbage trucks, which allow one trash collector to 
do the work of two. 
</P>
<P>
 And they learned about the city's plan to build a waste transfer station, a 
giant warehouse where recyclables will be sorted and trash will be shipped to 
dumps outside Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our landfill is about to close, so the city is preparing for the long run," 
Oxnard City Planner Cynthia Daniels told the Swedes as they munched on pastry 
adorned with American flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Gronvall said Sweden has made many trash collection advancements. Recycling 
and composting are popular in his country. And, in a limited pilot project, 
government officials have inserted computer chips into garbage cans to weigh 
trash so that customers only have to pay for what they throw away. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Sweden, we have a philosophy that if you use something, instead of 
throwing it away, you should put it right back into the system," Gronvall said. 
"Hopefully in the future, we won't need any more landfills." FRED ALVAREZ

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FILING DEADLINE FOR QUAKE AID IS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With thousands of victims of the Northridge earthquake continuing to register 
for disaster assistance, the deadline for filing applications has been extended 
for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 People seeking financial aid have until May 17 to register at one of nine 
earthquake service centers or three remaining disaster application centers, or 
by calling (800) 462-9029. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be sure that everyone affected by the disaster has ample time to 
apply," said Frank Kishton, coordinating officer for the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program to 
individuals and businesses has also been extended to May 17. The deadline to 
apply for SBA's economic injury loans -- which provide working capital for 
firms hurt financially by the quake -- remains Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 As of March 15, 454,650 individuals have applied for assistance. FEMA has 
disbursed nearly $473 million for disaster housing assistance, SBA has approved 
more than $456 million in individual and business loans, and the state's 
Individual and Family Grant Program has approved nearly $6.4 million in aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley on Wednesday, state and federal disaster officials briefed 
officials from quake-damaged school districts, municipalities and nonprofit 
organizations on how to obtain government aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Curry, spokeswoman for the governor's Office of Emergency Services, told 
the group that to qualify for FEMA aid to repair damaged buildings, applicants 
must buy earthquake insurance or send quotes from at least three insurers 
showing that the policy was too expensive or difficult to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 And OES spokesman Chris Adams said federal and state aid will pay for most of 
the cost of earthquake-preparedness plans, including work to make buildings 
safer for occupants during any subsequent disaster. JULIO MORAN

WEST VALLEY COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CHAMBER IS FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Evie Bystrom-Herrera has been 
fired from her post after three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was caught absolutely without warning," Bystrom-Herrera said Tuesday, a day 
after her dismissal."I'd had a staff meeting, went out and sold a membership, 
came back and was told to clean out my office." 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber Communications Manager Joan Kryshak will manage the chamber office 
until the board finds another executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Although board President Douglas J. Rosecrans declined to discuss the reasons 
for the board's decision, he said that since Bystrom-Herrera was hired in June, 
1991, membership in the chamber has fallen by nearly 30% from 696 to 498. 
</P>
<P>
 The membership decline may partly reflect the recession's impact on some 
businesses, Rosecrans said. But he said the chamber has not been as aggressive 
as it could be in recruiting new members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camarillo has many businesses (that) would like to become chamber members and 
just need to be asked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystrom-Herrera said the chamber actually had far fewer members in 1991 than 
the reported 696. "That's a bogus number to begin with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies had been listed twice because they had more than one mailing 
address, she said, and other businesses that had been on the list were far 
behind in their dues. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MAN SUSPECTED OF IMPERSONATION HELD

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Northridge man was arrested Wednesday morning in Thousand Oaks when he used 
flashing red lights mounted on his pickup truck in an attempt to zip around 
rush-hour traffic, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he forced other motorists aside on the Moorpark Freeway at Olsen Road, 
Roger Prince was spotted by two sheriff's deputies returning to the East Valley 
sheriff's station at the end of their shift.When the deputies tried to pull 
Prince over, he briefly led them on a chase before stopping in a residential 
area near Calle Tulipan, Sgt. Keith Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, 21, was taken into custody on suspicion of impersonating a peace 
officer and evading arrest and booked into jail at the East Valley station. He 
was released later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks said Prince was apparently using the lights to bypass morning traffic by 
appearing to be an emergency vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Two passengers in Prince's pickup truck were not cited. JULIE FIELDS

 A Simi Valley woman has been convicted of federal bank robbery charges in 
connection with the theft of more than $43,000 from the Westlake Village bank 
where she worked as a teller, FBI officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Deleon Cesar, 34, pleaded guilty Monday in U. S. District Court to 
charges that she stole $10,800 from customers' accounts, $24,500 from a 
certificate of deposit and $8,000 in checks intended for deposit in customers' 
accounts between 1990 and 1992, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar worked at the HomeFed Bank branch at 3825 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 She is scheduled to be sentenced May 10 by U. S. District Judge Ronald Lew in 
Los Angeles. Cesar faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1-million fine. JULIE

<P>
 Seeking to inspire tolerance and encourage peace, Holocaust survivor George 
Donnenberg will present two free lectures at California Lutheran University 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnenberg, a Hungarian-born Jew, endured 17 concentration camps during the 
Holocaust, shuttling from Hungary to Austria to Czechoslovakia to Poland under 
Nazi command. 
</P>
<P>
 He will discuss his experiences and answer questions from the public during 
the two presentations, scheduled at 10 a.m. March 21 and 8 p.m. March 24. Both 
will be held in the Preus-Brandt Forum on Cal Lutheran's Thousand Oaks campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people will learn that everybody's human and we should not be fighting 
one another," said Donnenberg, 72, who owns a photo shop in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between Vietnam, Bosnia and Somalia -- all that's going on the world -- I 
hope people will come to their senses," he added. "That's what I hope. . . . 
But that's all we have is hope." 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the presentations, which are scheduled to last about 90 
minutes each, contact the university at 493-3151. STEPHANIE SIMON

SCOTT HARRIS: TAFT OFFERS LESSONS FOR L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, Taft High School is in its glory. Once again, its prize students 
are being featured on the 11 o'clock news and in the newspapers, and gaudy 
trophies are on display in the main office. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, for the fourth time in eight years, the Woodland Hills school 
named for America's portliest president claimed first place in the California 
State Academic Decathlon. By Wednesday, the old school marquee had lost some 
letters. But you could still get the meaning. "THE AMPIONS," it declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Four titles in eight years. This is the stuff of legend, like the Lakers of 
Magic and Kareem. A big difference: Bright kids don't sign long-term contracts 
to stay in high school and ace tests. Pat Riley might be a good basketball 
coach, but his efforts pale beside the feat of English teacher Arthur Berchin, 
who has coached Taft to three of its four state titles. Next month, he'll try 
for a second national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Berchin, who exudes the infectious enthusiasm common among good teachers, 
enjoys the success. Kudos pour in from administrators, colleagues, parents and 
editorial writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was," Berchin says, "just the perfect time to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's funny how the good work of nine bright kids can boost the morale of a 
school district that serves more than 650,000. The timing is ideal because a 
few days earlier standardized tests again showed the Los Angeles Unified School 
District to be suffering. This was no great surprise in a district that 
educates increasing numbers of low-income minority students, including many 
immigrants with limited English skills. On the same day The Times reported 
Taft's triumph, it also featured an article describing how the low test scores 
had piqued parents' interest in private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft's triumph was good PR for a district that badly needs some. It was 
heralded as proof that Los Angeles public schools, for all their troubles, can 
still provide a quality education. As Berchin puts it: "Why spend $11,000 at 
Harvard-Westlake when you can get the same quality education at Taft?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Berchin doesn't want too much to be read into Taft's success in the 
academic decathlon. Those districtwide test scores, from the merely tepid to 
terrible, haven't been erased. 
</P>
<P>
 Berchin, who has proved his ability to motivate top students, is a man who 
would love to see his ideas tested among the masses. His career in education is 
long and varied. Before joining the Taft faculty 10 years ago, Berchin earned a 
doctorate in education administration at UCLA and served as assistant dean in 
UCLA's graduate school of education for seven years. In returning to Taft, he 
resumed the teaching career that began with a stint at Los Angeles High School 
from 1967-70. 
</P>
<P>
 Berchin is convinced that schools need radical reform to tailor education to 
students' needs. Consider, for example, the "self-contained classroom" dinosaur 
-- the teacher standing and imparting knowledge to 35 students all lined up in 
their desks. It isn't unusual, Berchin says, for a 10th-grade class to have 
students whose reading abilities range from above grade level to 3rd-grade 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Berchin's suggestion: Create large lecture classes for grade-level students, 
much like those they would encounter as college freshmen. This would allow the 
school to place below-grade-level students in smaller class settings. These 
students would benefit more from such an environment, just as the whiz kids in 
Taft's academic decathlon program have flourished while competing among 
themselves under the close guidance of their teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one very simple lesson from Taft's success, Berchin says: Hard work 
pays off. The Taft team put in extraordinary hours over the summer and after 
school. Berchin, resorting to the jargon of the educator, emphasizes that "time 
at task" is "the most important variable" in learning. 
</P>
<P>
 So if America really wants to get serious about education, if it wants its 
elementary schools to rival Japan's or the best of Europe, Berchin suggests 
that the answer is obvious: Make the school day and the school year longer, 
just like theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that would mean spending money on public education. Over the past 
15 years, the amount California has spent per student has plummeted right along 
with test scores. Now we're paying for that on the back end, committing 
billions to build more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's a downside to glory. "It's nothing tangible," Berchin says, but he can 
sense "a lot of resentment." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a matter of envy, Berchin says. It's a matter of teachers trying to 
do a good job and getting scant recognition for their efforts. And it's a 
matter of teachers who've turned young lives around, who have steered kids away 
from gangs and drugs, who have talked them out of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see this program get all this attention," Berchin says, "and their 
efforts go unrewarded."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LAS CASITAS FLOOD CHANNEL TO BE 
FENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Thousand Oaks' Las Casitas neighborhood will soon see a 
long-awaited fence blocking off a flood control channel that had been used as a 
campsite for revelers and transients. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday authorized a contract with the Ventura County 
Flood Control District to build a wrought-iron fence around the concrete 
channel, which residents described as dangerous and unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
 In pressing for the wall, residents had argued that installing a wrought-iron 
fence atop an existing block wall would prevent teen-agers and homeless people 
from clambering into the flood control channel. The fence, they said, would 
help the neighborhood by cutting down on noise and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will prove very effective in the long run," Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Las Casitas homeowners association and the city will each kick in $97,200, 
and the flood control district will add $8,000 to build the fence along the 
South Branch Arroyo Conejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement basically signs, seals and delivers this very important 
project for the neighborhood," Assistant City Manager MaryJane Lazz said.

COUNCIL ALLOCATES $255,542 IN GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Port Hueneme will use a majority of its federal Community Block Grant funds 
this year to help design handicap-accessible buildings, refurbish Bard Park and 
stimulate economic development, the City Council decided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless federal officials reimburse the city for previously committing this 
year's grants for earthquake relief, the city would not receive the $255,542 
and would be unable to fulfill its spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't have the money otherwise," City Manager Dick Velthoen said before 
the council's 3-0 vote. Mayor Orvene Carpenter and Councilman Dorill B. Wright 
were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to set aside $20,000 of the money to help fund four 
nonprofit agencies that provide services to the homeless and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly $70,000 would be spent on projects that would usually be paid out of 
the city's general fund, including graffiti control, crossing guards, code 
enforcement, a senior nutrition program and improvements at Bard Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remainder, the council decided to target $46,000 for the design of 
facilities to meet new access standards required by the federal Americans with 
Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 And the council voted to use $50,000 for a trial program to spur economic 
activity in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant hired by the city, San Jose-based ProVision Business Services, 
said the city can subsidize certain types of projects proposed by the Port 
Hueneme Chamber of Commerce and still meet the stringent guidelines for 
spending the federal money on low- and middle-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber has proposed several programs to improve business in the city, 
including a plan to link local businesses with the Naval Construction Battalion 
Center's supply purchasing system. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote, Velthoen called the aid to the city's economy crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's money well spent when you consider the city's own revenue base depends 
on a healthy economy," Velthoen said. PATRICK McCARTNEY

5 ARRESTED IN NEWBURY PARK COCAINE SEIZURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A three-week undercover investigation by narcotics detectives from the Ventura 
County Sheriff's Department has led to the arrest of five Newbury Park 
residents suspected of dealing rock cocaine in the area, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives seized 400 pieces of rock cocaine valued at $10,000, the largest 
amount of rock cocaine the department has seized in Thousand Oaks, said Sgt. 
Gary Pentis of the East Valley narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests were made late Tuesday after undercover detectives witnessed the 
delivery and sale of the drugs from one suspect's home, the deputies' report 
said. Detectives witnessed suspected buyers go from the residence to a nearby 
alley to smoke the rock or crack cocaine, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover agents then made drug purchases from one of the suspects and used 
information from the drug buy and the surveillance to obtain search warrants 
for two homes where the 400 pieces of rock cocaine were found, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Alejandro Rodriguez, 24; Alice Garcia, 26; Jorge Arjon, 25; Alma 
Martinez, 23, and Jose Hernandez, 22. All were booked into the East Valley 
Jail, deputies said.

BACK TO SCHOOL; AFTER REPAIRS, SIMI HIGH HAS A HOMECOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The early start time couldn't dampen sophomore Rosie Paynter's enthusiasm 
Wednesday as she returned to newly reopened Simi Valley High School after 
attending afternoon sessions at rival Royal High for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting up in the mornings will take getting used to again, said Rosie, who 
has been reporting to school four hours later than usual because the joined 
schools have been on split morning and afternoon schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, it was good to be back on familiar turf for the first time 
since the Jan. 17 temblor forced Simi High's closure for nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our home," said Rosie, 15. "It's where we belong." 
</P>
<P>
 Students were welcomed back for Wednesday's half-day session with painted 
paper signs with such enthusiastic slogans as "Whoopee!Simi is so cool." 
Teachers unpacked the white boxes that served as traveling desks since the 
cross-town rivals began sharing the Royal High campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm going to keep the box for old time's sake," English teacher Mary 
Poppen said as she emptied her container of everything from graded papers to 
lesson plans, pencils, facial tissues and paper clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddie Hellman, a campus supervisor and president of the Simi High 
Parent-Teacher-Student Assn., said the first day back was like the first day of 
school -- for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our first day at the beginning of the year, then when we went to Royal 
and here again today," Hellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Principal Kathryn Scroggin said the day had more meaning than a normal 
first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's coming home and having family together again," she said. "It's like a 
reunion." 
</P>
<P>
 English teacher Virginia Stout agreed that the feelings were stronger than 
when returning from summer vacation because everyone was locked out during 
repairs to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you weren't allowed in, and now you are allowed in and it's a 
privilege to come back," Stout said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gymnasium and multipurpose room remained off-limits because of structural 
damage from the 6.8-magnitude quake. No estimates have been completed, but 
officials believe that the cost to repair the two buildings could be $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi High sustained about $3 million in damage overall, said Ralph Wilson, 
assistant superintendent for the Simi Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallen plaster from walkway overhangs has been removed in several areas, but 
has yet to be replaced. That kind of touch-up work will be done over the next 
several months, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the classrooms, most walls were stripped of posters and mementos and 
covered with a fresh coat of paint. Many have new ceiling tiles and light 
fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you could have seen this place two weeks ago, it looked like a war zone," 
Wilson said proudly after the first hour of school went off without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbestos discovered in fallen ceiling tiles delayed the school's opening in 
January while state certified contractors were brought in to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough evidence of the quake remained behind Wednesday -- including the 
unfinished overhangs and huge metal dumpsters set out to collect cleanup debris 
-- to make senior Larry Moore uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of hard coming to this," Larry said. "It reminds you of everything 
that happened." 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the transition, today will again be a half day, running from 8 a.m. to 
12:50 p.m. Students throughout the district have Friday off for a staff 
training day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a challenge," science teacher Wally Boggess said. "Next year by 
this time, we'll probably be looking back on it and saying, 'That was quite an 
experience.' " 
</P>
<P>
 English teacher H. R. Mazzare said that feeling could last a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've taught at Simi High for 25 years," Mazzare said. "I've seen a lot of 
things come and go, but this year has been one heck of an experience."

OFFICIALS DENY LATINOS PURPOSELY EXCLUDED FROM GRAND JURY; GOVERNMENT: DEFENSE 
ATTORNEYS IN A THOUSAND OAKS DEATH-PENALTY CASE FILE A MOTION SEEKING RECORDS 
ON THE PANEL'S ETHNIC MAKEUP OVER THE PAST DECADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a legal challenge in a death-penalty case, local officials 
denied Wednesday that Latinos are systematically excluded from the Ventura 
County grand jury and said many of them are either too young to serve on the 
panel or are noS. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the judge presiding over the Thousand Oaks death-penalty case in 
which the issue has been raised removed himself from hearing the matter 
regarding the makeup of the grand jury because of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath said he disqualified himself from 
hearing the motion because he and his colleagues on the bench select the grand 
jury. A visiting judge from Santa Barbara County will decide the issue, McGrath 
said in court. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will preside over the remainder of the case, including the trial 
set for Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeup of the grand jury became an issue in the case last month, when 
attorneys for defendant Mark Scott Thornton filed a motion asking that the 
county turn over records relating to the ethnic and racial composition of the 
grand jury from the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton, 19, is accused of kidnaping and fatally shooting Westlake nurse 
Kellie O'Sullivan on Sept. 19. The case captured widespread attention at the 
time, especially during a 12-day search for O'Sullivan. Her body was found amid 
brush in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Although O'Sullivan was white and Thornton is white, defense attorneys have 
questioned whether the grand jury that indicted Thornton in December had the 
proper number of Latinos on it to be cross-representational of the county's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton's attorneys also want to examine the makeup of the grand jury over 
the past 10 years to determine whether there has been a pattern of 
systematically excluding Latinos from the panel. The grand jury investigates 
political corruption and considers felony criminal matters for indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto R. Orellana, assistant county counsel, said a preliminary review in 
response to the defense motion shows that no discrimination against Latinos or 
other minorities who have been eligible to sit on the grand jury has been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 He said 10.8% of the 300 people serving on the grand jury in the past 10 years 
have been Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Orellana said during that same time span, only 14.9% of the Latinos in the 
county have been eligible for service. He based eligibility to serve on whether 
the person is at least 18 years of age and a citizen of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the percentage of Latinos eligible for grand jury service could 
decrease even further when such factors as proficiency in English are taken 
into account. 
</P>
<P>
 For the defense to successfully argue that Latinos have been systematically 
excluded from the county grand jury, the disparity between those eligible to 
serve and those picked for the panel would have to be at least 5%, Orellana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the difference is 4.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to show that there had been no active discrimination and the 
courts have done all they could do," Orellana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson said defense attorneys would still like 
to research the issue to see what results they come up with regarding the grand 
jury's ethnic composition. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said defense attorneys believe that Latinos have indeed been excluded 
from grand jury service, although, she said, they don't feel that the 
exclusions have been purposeful. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the defense would like to have Thornton's grand jury indictment 
thrown out. Grand jury proceedings are closed to defense attorneys and the 
public. Olson suggested that grand juries are too easily manipulated by 
prosecutors.

MOORPARK CRIME RATE FELL IN 1993; STATISTICS: CITY HAD 19.15 SERIOUS INCIDENTS 
FOR EVERY 1,000 RESIDENTS. BUT OFFICIALS WARN RESIDENTS AGAINST COMPLACENCY. 
</P>

 Moorpark, the safest city in Ventura County in 1992, got even safer last year, 
according to a report issued Wednesday by the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show that only 19.15 serious crimes -- ranging from arson to auto 
theft to murder -- occurred for each 1,000 Moorpark residents in 1993, down 
from 20.93 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to show that Moorpark is a fairly safe place to live," said 
Sheriff's Lt. Geoff Dean, who heads up Moorpark enforcement. "But we need to 
encourage people not to become complacent and help us help them in maintaining 
a safe environment." 
</P>
<P>
 And while most categories of crime were down in Moorpark in 1993, there were 
some areas of concern, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residential burglaries jumped from 97 in 1992 to 111 last year, and the number 
of aggravated assaults increased from 42 to 50, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean said five of the assaults were cases of spousal battery, 11 involved 
battery on a child and 10 were directed at sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these, while very unfortunate, are not necessarily preventable 
crimes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean also estimated that 40% of the residential burglaries involved unsecured 
homes in which garage doors were left open or other doors and windows left 
unlocked. "We surely don't want people to get complacent," he said. "One of the 
battles we face is people getting complacent." 
</P>
<P>
 Largely because of the jump in assaults, violent crime was up 11.3% in 
Moorpark in 1993, while property crimes fell 10.8% and crime overall dropped 
8.5% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the relatively few crimes overall in the city, Dean said the 
value of such percentages is dubious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The percentages are difficult because we're dealing with such small numbers," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An illustration, Dean said, is in the case of rape, which the report shows 
declining by 25% from 1992 because the total number of reported rapes fell from 
4 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason said he was encouraged by the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks like a continuation of the results of excellent police coverage 
and work on the part of the Police Department," Lawrason said. "I'm very 
pleased with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has made law enforcement overall a priority by allocating more than 
half of its general fund dollars to its contract with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the city spent $2.4 million on law enforcement, 62% of all general 
fund allocations, said Richard Hare, deputy city manager. The city spent $2.2 
million on law enforcement in 1992, a 61% allocation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bright spot contained in the report, officials said, was the declining 
criminal activity of the city's 48 residents identified as hard-core gang 
members, largely due to increased enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 While deputies listed 836 "contacts" with gang members in 1993 -- up from 509 
the previous year -- gang-related incidents dropped from 193 in 1992 to just 80 
last year. Also, the number of times that gang members violated conditions of 
their parole fell from 205 in 1992 to 115 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aggressively looking to reduce that problem," Lawrason said. "Maybe 
we've benefited by the experiences of other cities and decided we were going to 
emphasize the control of gang activity. . . . We've made that a priority and, 
consequently, it seems to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies have also been more vigilant in inspecting big-rig trucks winding 
their way through the city, issuing fewer citations than in 1992 but taking 
many more vehicles out of service. Citations are issued when minor mechanical 
problems are discovered, but when trucks pose more serious hazards, they are 
immediately taken out of service until repairs are made. 
</P>
<P>
 While 112 spot inspections were conducted in 1993 -- up from 93 the previous 
year -- the number of citations issued fell from 489 to 438, while the number 
of trucks taken out of service jumped from 38 in 1992 to 67 last year. So, Dean 
said, deputies were finding fewer problems overall, but more serious problems 
individually. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason expressed alarm at the increasing number of unsafe trucks driving on 
city streets and stressed the need for continued enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's frightening," he said, referring to the number of trucks taken out of 
service. "When you stop to think about it, the causes for taking a truck out of 
service a lot of times involve bad brakes and other safety items." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, deputies responded to 7,878 calls for service in 1993, a 4% increase 
over the previous year. Arrests jumped slightly from 1,218 in 1992 to 1,275 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean said the fact that deputies were busier last year gave them less time for 
routine traffic enforcement. Perhaps as a result, there were slight increases 
in the number of traffic accidents and injury accidents in the city. In all, 
there were 220 accidents last year compared with 210 in 1992, and 90 accidents 
involved injuries, as opposed to 70 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of people injured in all accidents fell from 111 in 1992 to 
100 last year. Crime in Moorpark 03,12,05,05 '92 '93 Homicide 1 1 Rape 4 3

2 MEN SOUGHT IN EL RIO SHOOTING

 Sheriff's deputies were searching for two men who waited for an El Rio man to 
return home, then fired several shots at him, striking him in the shoulder, 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred between 9:30 and 10 p.m. Tuesday at the home of Raul 
Gomez in the 2500 block of Wright Road. Gomez was treated for a gunshot wound 
at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez told deputies that the two men had arrived at his house Tuesday evening 
and persuaded his wife, Irma, to let them wait inside. They did not harm the 
wife, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Kelly Fadler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Gomez told deputies that he did not know the men.

PERMIT WAIVED FOR ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sexually oriented businesses in Oxnard will not have to obtain an 
entertainment permit but must still adhere to the city's adult business 
ordinance, the Oxnard City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 With the decision, the city will waive a $500 initial entertainment fee 
charged to businesses such as billiard halls, bingo parlors, massage parlors 
and arcades.The city assesses the initial fee and subsequent $106 annual fees 
to recover higher police and service costs associated with such businesses, 
City Atty. Gary Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for an applicant seeking to open an adult cabaret in Oxnard 
challenged the requirement, saying the city's entertainment permit does not 
conform to court rulings that extend First Amendment protection to adult 
businesses, Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig assured residents who protested the measure that the city was not 
dropping its recently adopted regulations for sexually oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "That does not mean an adult business does not need a business license, 
special use permit or is exempt from the adult business ordinance," Gillig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the emergency measure on a 4-1 vote Tuesday, with 
Councilman Michael Plisky dissenting. Plisky said he did not see the need to 
require any Oxnard business to obtain an entertainment permit.

FEMA OFFICIALS AGAIN SHRINK SIMI'S DESIGNATED FLOOD ZONE; PROPERTY: NEW 
REVISION CUTS OUT LARGE PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AREA. MORE THAN 1,400 
HOMEOWNERS WILL BE ABLE TO DROP SPECIAL INSURANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For the second time in less than a year, federal officials are shrinking Simi 
Valley's flood zone, enabling more than 1,400 homeowners to drop costly flood 
insurance and get refunds for last year's coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have cut out sizable 
portions of the designated flood zone in central Simi Valley in the second 
phase of a five-part revision of the city's flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest area being removed from the plain is bounded by Cochran Street, 
Sequoia Avenue, Sycamore Drive and the Arroyo Simi. But not all homes in the 
area are being cut out of the flood zone, so residents are encouraged to call 
City Hall to verify their status. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents financing or refinancing property in flood zones are required by 
federal law to purchase flood insurance, which can cost as much as $600 a year 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
 While many homeowners will no longer need flood coverage, federal officials 
have decided to add three small areas in the city's midsection to the flood 
zone. About 240 homeowners in those areas may be required to buy flood 
insurance if they need a loan to finance or refinance their house. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the three areas is bordered roughly by Los Angeles Avenue, 
Sycamore Drive, Ysrella Avenue and the Arroyo Simi. The second falls between 
Sequoia Avenue, Alamo Street, Tapo Canyon Road and the Simi Valley Freeway. The 
third is bounded by Tapo Street, Alpine Street, Las Llamas Canyon and the 
Arroyo Simi. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, about 84 commercial and industrial buildings are being removed 
from the flood zone and 80 are being added. Most businesses are not required to 
carry flood insurance, even if they are within a flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,400 homeowners who have been removed from the flood zone are eligible 
for refunds on their 1993 and 1994 policies, Mayor Greg Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over a couple of years, the numbers can really add up," he said. "It should 
be a nice refund for some people." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners interested in dropping flood coverage should pick up a letter from 
the city verifying their removal from the flood zone to present to their 
insurance agent, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the first phase of the study, completed in May, 800 homes on the city's 
east end were taken out of the flood zone. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,000 homes and businesses remain in the flood zone. City officials 
finalized the second-phase changes Monday, during a meeting with FEMA 
representatives while in Washington, for a National League of Cities 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good for us to be out there to meet with them face to face," 
Councilman Bill Davis said. "I think it really put the screws on and got this 
thing moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials have been pushing for a revision of the flood zone since 
1991, when a new federal flood map hiked the number of flood-prone homes from 
500 to 6,000. It was an increase that city leaders said greatly overstated the 
city's risk of flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he hoped to get the number of homes in the flood zone reduced to 
about 2,000. City leaders are urging FEMA to complete the revision by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has already dragged out long enough, and we'd like to get it done as 
soon as possible,' Stratton said. "Unfortunately, government isn't always as 
fast as we'd like it to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Mary Ann Miler said she was delighted that she may no 
longer have to pay flood insurance on her Blackstock Avenue home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great news," she said. "We've lived in the same house for 22 years 
without any trouble, so I couldn't believe it when we refinanced a couple of 
years ago and they told us we had to get flood insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Miler said she and her husband, Richard, would immediately drop their flood 
insurance, which costs more than $600 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make any sense to keep it," she said. "There's no way we would 
ever get flooded where we are." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 To find out if your home or business has been added to, or removed from, the 
flood zone, call Simi Valley City Hall at 583-6769.

 Volunteers are needed Saturday to lay sod for a second soccer field at Oxnard 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 The field will be used this summer by international teams training for the 
World Cup championships, to be held for the first time in the United 
States.Oxnard College is an official World Cup training site, but because it 
did not have regulation-size soccer fields, the college has had to build two 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers, many of them college staff members and students, laid sod for the 
first field March 5. The volunteers worked so quickly that they spread about 
100,000 square feet of sod in less than seven hours, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort will start Saturday at 6:30 a.m. For information, call the 
college's public information office at 986-5809.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TWO-SIDED THOMPSON; THE ROCK/FOLK GUITARIST CUTS LOUDLY LOOSE 
AND STAYS QUIETLY TIGHT AT THE WILSHIRE EBELL. HE'LL PLAY THE COACH HOUSE ON 
FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As an electric guitarist, Richard Thompson is a string-bender extraordinaire 
who defies convention with definably weird, siren-like, jazz-baiting solos that 
insanely intensify and bite, sting and buzz around the key. 
</P>
<P>
 On acoustic, though, he's something else altogether: a correct English 
gentleman, doing the most muss-free, careful, elegant, dead-on picking a 
craftsman could cultivate. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the Jekyll and Hyde of guitar heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's show Tuesday at the Wilshire Ebell was a pleasing trade-off between 
those two equally satisfying sides, as the veteran singer-songwriter 
efficiently compromised the intensity of his full-band "rock" shows with the 
dry wit and unassuming nimbleness of his "folk" sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by three veterans who come equally adept at hard rock and traditional 
Irish folk -- and whom he occasionally shunted offstage during his solo spots 
-- Thompson afforded fans a rare tour configuration that had him alternately 
cutting loudly loose and staying quietly, properly tight. 
</P>
<P>
 If, subsequently, the wandering two-hour-plus show lacked for momentum -- with 
Thompson sometimes curiously juxtaposing his more emotionally wrenching songs 
with his wackier ones -- it gave good breadth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the set's 24 songs were from his latest album, "Mirror Blue," which is 
by no means one of his most memorable. The 1993 recording's tunes tend toward 
the novel but, despite their cleverness, more often than not lack the emotional 
firepower that Thompson has brought to his best work (and that Elvis Costello 
seems able to invest in similarly impersonal, third-person storytelling these 
days).  
</P>
<P>
 The dominance of the new stuff might have been a liability, then, hadn't 
Thompson the gift for bringing even his relative throwaways to vivid life in 
concert. The recent album's "The Way That It Shows," especially, picked up an 
instrumental fury in this setting that rivaled the expected chaos of his 
signature standby, "Shoot Out the Lights." 
</P>
<P>
 The players all go back a ways with Thompson, and while their ability to 
handle the harder stuff might not have seemed so predestined, their agility on 
the folkier material certainly was a given. 
</P>
<P>
 With former Fairport Convention cohort Dave Mattacks drumming, Danny Thompson 
(who, Thompson wryly recalled, was a member of a fellow '60s "beat combo," the 
"rival outfit" Pentangle) on bass, and another frequent collaborator, Pete 
Zorn, weighing in with penny whistle, soprano sax, mandolin, et al., Thompson 
occasionally broke the contemporary tone of the set. 
</P>
<P>
 He fed the faithful a few choice somber obscurities -- including "The Sun 
Never Shines on the Poor," "Hokey Pokey" and the old Fairport B-side "Now Be 
Thankful" -- with the band, or at a couple of points without, as they departed 
the stage to his quips about "a quick union dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson brings this tour Friday night to the Coach House, where good sound is 
as much a given as his own excellence. L.A. fans can't count on the same, as 
lately Thompson's shows up north have usually been at the classy but 
acoustically nightmarish Wiltern. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The change of venue this time did a world of good, and the singer, who was at 
his off-the-cuff bantering best here, duly noted same, sincerely pointing out, 
"It's a nice place, better than that other W-word -- it sounds better." 
</P>
<P>
 Right he is; it'd be nice to see the Wilshire Ebell (an old hall situated in 
one of L.A. proper's wealthiest neighborhoods that usually plays host to 
nothing more rowdy than a string quartet) used for a lot more grown-up pop 
shows now that the ice has been broken. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Thompson plays Friday at 9 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $18.50. (714) 496-8930.

DANCE REVIEW; ENSEMBLE GIVES LESSON IN THE POWER OF 'WORDS'

 Although it was necessary to see the earlier dances to process the movement 
vocabulary that would surface later, nothing -- absolutely nothing -- prepared 
for the searing intensity of "Dance Words," which opened the second part of the 
program by the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble on Tuesday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration for the work dates back to the early '70s, when an underground 
political movement surfaced in Hungary in which young people danced traditional 
folk steps while shouting protest poems by Laszlo Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompaniment was pared down to basic rhythms provided by the poet's text and 
percussive strikes on a cello-like instrument called the gardon , which was 
slung across a musician's chest. Costuming was likewise simplified to everyday 
street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The repressive authorities must have been terrified by the raw power and 
focused anger and invincible spirit evident in the movement and this particular 
work. They banned the piece, created by company artistic director and 
choreographer Sandor Timar, after only four performances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every traditional element in the choreography took on a different 
meaning and tone because the verbal accompaniment and the everyday costuming 
raised it to a new level of abstraction, concentration and universality. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's contained arm gestures looked both suppressed and explosive. The 
men's arm-arching turns seemed to be bounding flights of freedom. The fluid 
formations and dissolves among lines of dancers and simple couples suggested 
new social solidarity and relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the artwork created by the youth of his country, Timar has shown 
how 19th-Century traditions can be preserved and made relevant to the late 20th 
Century and even become a laser-like influence into the future. A brilliant 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, for a non-Hungarian, much of the rest of the program, which was 
sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society, looked like a museum 
collection -- perhaps a necessary and authentic and attractive museum 
collection, but one that did not relate to this time and the future as did this 
piece. This judgment may be unfair because texts for all the songs were not 
available, which meant an incomplete understanding of their contexts. (Press 
members did receive a copy of Nagy's poem, but only after the piece was 
danced). Still, the relentless upbeat quality of the other works mitigated 
against such contemporaneity.

THEATER REVIEW; VERY NICE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, 'HELEN'; IN THIS CAL STATE 
FULLERTON PRODUCTION, DIRECTOR MEREDITH WRIGHT INTRODUCES THE AUDIENCE TO ONE 
OF THE FIRST ROMANTIC COMEDIES. WHAT A REFRESHING CHOICE!

 Since professional theater has long demonstrated not-so-benign neglect of 
Greek drama, and non-pros wouldn't have a clue with it, about the only place in 
this country you're likely to hear any kind of Greek theater is on campus, 
where it's supposedly studied. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news out of Cal State Fullerton's drama department, where Euripides' 
"Helen" is being staged in the school's Arena Theatre, is that there's 
something for the audience to study. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean that "Helen" is a tough, grim or even profound lesson. To 
the contrary: Judging by director Meredith Wright's handling of a translation 
by James Michie and Colin Leach, it seems amazing that "Helen" isn't better 
known than it is, since it really is one of the very first examples of romantic 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not Shakespeare knew of the play, we can't help but make the 
connections between this tale of Helen (Christine Sheppard) -- she who launched 
a thousand ships against Troy and was rescued from Egypt by her warrior 
husband, Menelaos (Brad Hoffner) -- and Shakespeare's "The Winter's Tale" or 
even "The Tempest."  
</P>
<P>
 This is neither wailing Greek tragedy, nor high comedy a la Aristophanes. 
"Helen" is different. 
</P>
<P>
 Euripides' own Helen is different, too. His portrait goes head-on against 
Homer's depiction of Helen as the beautiful woman held by Troy in a plot by the 
jealous gods. This Helen was never in Troy (instead, the gods planted an 
illusory one, a "false Helen"). 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, to serve Euripides' anti-war sentiment, the bloody and tragic Trojan War 
was based on an illusion. Even though she is from Sparta, the Athenian 
Euripides truly likes this woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a Yankee playwright making a heroine of the wife of Robert E. Lee in a 
drama written during the height of the Civil War, and you get an idea of the 
nerve behind "Helen." 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than the anger -- and flabbiness -- of Euripides' much better-known 
"The Trojan Women," "Helen" is a spry, light entertainment focused on a woman's 
desire for freedom and the peace of marriage, celebrating a world where "the 
best magic is a balanced mind and a little common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Schaumburg as the leading voice of the chorus does this and many another 
line with a nod and a wink, and Wright has generally gotten it across to her 
cast that this is light-years from "Oedipus Rex." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sheppard and Hoffner are too young to suggest this couple as a 
paragon of middle-aged love, they do seem to have the hots for each other. 
While Michael Miranda is ineffectually wooden as young Pharoah Theoklymenos 
planning to wed Helen himself, he is nicely thunderstruck and peeved when he 
learns the elaborate tricks played on him to whisk Helen away. Here, "Helen" 
becomes a close cousin to the fairy-tales of the hero stumping the king. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a lot of American college Shakespeare, Wright's Greek experiment 
painfully lacks trained voices. The Greeks wrote sung texts, full of 
aria/monologues and broad declarative and expository passages. They are the 
sections today's dramaturges would ask to be rewritten -- though, to be fair, 
they do sound foreign to us. Unfortunately, they also sound foreign to today's 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheppard has some of the voice and expression for Helen's laments, and 
Schaumburg leads by example, while Katie Zerga displays the most impressive 
vocal cords of all as the mischievous Portress and Hera. 
</P>
<P>
 But the poetry otherwise goes flat here, and no amount of Peter Gabriel music 
(on tape) or sonic overlay by percussionist (Nick Hoffman) makes it any easier 
on the ear. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bit easier for the eye, especially designer Mark Chotiner's tilted disc 
set, which encourages the sense that we're watching an amphitheater staging. 
Karen Wight's costumes take too much after Chotiner's willowy curtains, and the 
prancing about with the chorus, Aphrodite et al. waving their chiffon comes 
perilously close to someone's bad lampoon of arch Greek drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is what "Helen" precisely isn't. 
</P>

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: TAKING WORRY OUT OF KIDS' BIRTHDAY PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If you have been there once, you never forget it. The smells. The screams. The 
anguish. The carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking about a homicide scene; we're talking about a children's 
birthday party at home. Those two hours that seem like a week. A week in 
Bedlam. 
</P>
<P>
 And afterward, you are happy if a post-party inventory of devastation uncovers 
only three broken heirlooms, half a dozen grape juice stains on the carpet and 
two sets of chocolate hand prints on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, I'm happy if we only have to repaint the place and don't have to get 
involved with drywalling! 
</P>
<P>
 Free-lance writer Barbara Weldon Tone was the perfect candidate to do this 
week's centerpiece on out-of-home birthday parties. She has the experience and 
the battle scars of a kid birthday veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my last home birthday party for my daughter when she was about 5," 
Weldon Tone said. "It was a disaster. First of all, the children didn't want to 
play any of the games I had. It was just pandemonium. They were running in the 
house, out of the house." 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, she said, she took 24 kids to a place specializing in kids' 
birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a ball. We've been doing it this way ever since," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon Tone, who offers a list of party options around the county, was 
surprised that a happy time could be had by all -- including the adults -- for 
a reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found that it was not any more expensive than having it at home, and in 
some ways it was cheaper. At home, you can spend a fortune on party favors 
alone. But at these places, the children are kept more entertained, so parents 
don't have to spend as much on games and prizes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And some of the places provide crafts that can be taken home. They are 
lovely, and the kids make or at least decorate the items themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 And the paint job is someone else's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 One place parents probably wouldn't throw a birthday party would be at a 
sewage treatment complex. But after reading Jane Hulse's Jaunts column this 
week, they might. The sanitation operation in Ventura doubles as a wildlife 
refuge, and it has been attracting intrepid bird watchers from around the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 More feathered creatures -- and other animals -- visited 250 of our children 
gathered in Foster Park last week for an "Earth Summit." According to 
Earthwatch columnist Richard Kahlenberg, relations between the young humans and 
representatives of other species, which included pythons, birds of prey and sea 
cucumbers, were -- despite occasional exclamations of Oh, creepy" -- quite 
cordial.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: DANCE VIDEOS LET YOU SET OWN PACE TO LEARN BASICS; LOCALLY 
PRODUCED INSTRUCTIONAL TAPES AID THOSE WHO ARE DAUNTED BY THE IDEA OF MASTERING 
THE MOVES IN PUBLIC.

 Whenever a fella first asks a certain gal pal of mine to dance, she gets into 
dance position facing him. She looks him in the eye and says disarmingly, 
"Don't dip me, spin me or drop me." And off they go. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Transactional Analysis approach to couples dancing erases all subtlety 
from lead-and-follow skills cultivated by Two-Step fans. But video dance 
instructors Wiley Hicks and his partner, Tresa Young, totally relate to her 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are terrified on the dance floor if they can't trust their partner to 
lead," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using 25 years of professional ballroom experience, the three-time national 
country dance champion shares his expertise in a new series of instructional 
videotapes for country line and partner dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250,000 of the videos have sold nationally, and the sixth and newest 
one just hit the store shelves. They are produced locally by Brentwood 
Communications, a 6-year-old Westlake Village company run by David Catlin, who 
also brought disco dance lessons to video 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood plans to release one more line dancing and one more partner dancing 
tape. Then, Hicks said he will begin filming similar videos for swing dancing, 
which is enjoying great popularity on the country scene. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently joined Hicks and Young for a demonstration at the Academy of Dance 
in Thousand Oaks, where Young teaches. The two met dancing and have been 
partners on and off the dance floor for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had couples come up to us when we're out dancing socially and ask what 
steps we were doing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I tell 'em, 'same as you. But it's not what we were doing but how and why 
we were doing it,' " added Hicks. "It's the presentation, and that comes from 
ballroom training." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said it took him a long time to accept line dancing because it seemed a 
violation of country dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Line dancing is not country in origin; it's rock 'n' roll. Electric slide 15 
years ago was called The Freeze," said Hicks. "But I have finally learned to 
enjoy line dances because I think they're a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he added, it is a way to have a good time without the responsibility of a 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "But couples dancing should also be enjoyable, lovely to see and have style," 
he said. "Some people may not agree, but dance in good taste should be a 
vertical expression of a horizontal desire."

IN TIMES OF NEED, POLICE CHAPLAINS ARE ON THE SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When two police officers were shot in a Torrance hotel recently, one of the 
first calls the officer in charge of the case made was to the Torrance Police 
Department's chaplain corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, Dean Mayeda and three other volunteer chaplains were on their 
way to the Holiday Inn. "I got down there and it was sort of chaos in the 
lobby," said Mayeda, a minister at Hope Chapel Gateway, a Christian church on 
Maple Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates Police Capt. Michael Tracy and Sgt. Vernon Thomas 
Vanderpool had been shot when a gunman burst into a room where police were 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayeda and another chaplain accompanied Torrance Police Chief Joseph C. 
DeLadurantey as he informed the other officers that the two had died. 
</P>
<P>
 To help them deal with the tragedy, Mayeda and Richard Olsen, deacon at Little 
Company of Mary Hospital, led the officers in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I learned is that just the fact that we were there made a big 
difference," Mayeda said. "People said, 'You guys took an unholy situation and 
made it holy again.' . . . It was good to be there for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Husband-and-wife chaplains George and Nancy Johnson of the Cathedral of Life 
Foursquare Church on Prairie Avenue, meanwhile, went to the hospital to comfort 
the dead officers' families. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaplains are among eight volunteer ministers who are on call 24 hours a 
day to help Torrance police with everything from notifying people that a family 
member has died to calming down couples at domestic-violence calls. While much 
of their time is spent helping officers deal with the public, the main purpose 
of the chaplain program is to lend an understanding ear to overwhelmed 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have found them to be as valuable a component in running a police 
department as any other element," DeLadurantey said. "To me they have become as 
important as a car or a gun or anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance created the Chaplain Corps in December, 1992. Of the first six 
trained in the city, three remain. In January, the city swore in five more 
clergymen. The Police Department advertised openings in the program, then 
tested and trained volunteers. All religious denominations were welcome to 
apply, but all the current chaplains are Christians, said Sgt. David Smith, who 
coordinates the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The department doesn't require that volunteers serve a fixed amount of time, 
just that the chaplains trade off carrying a beeper so one is available at all 
times. Mayeda said in his first year he was called out about 10 times. In 
addition, each chaplain decides how much time to spend at the station getting 
to know the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to demand too much of them because of those times we call at 3 
o'clock in the morning. But we have yet to have anyone say, 'No I can't make 
it, I'm too tired.' It's always, 'What more can I do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new chaplains is Wayne Holbrook, an assistant pastor at Believer's 
Family Fellowship on 237th Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Two of Holbrook's brothers work in law enforcement, one for the Los Angeles 
Police Department and another for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought I would be a cop," Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school student, he worked in the LAPD's Explorer program. After he 
earned a two-year degree in police science, Holbrook began working with young 
people and later went to divinity school. Now, he said, he can use his 
knowledge of police officers and his skills as a minister. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with background, Holbrook said, he realizes it will take time to 
develop relationships in the station house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't come in and expect to be buddy-buddy right away," Holbrook said. 
"That's something that will take time. We've got to let them know we're not 
here to be Bible-thumping." 
</P>
<P>
 The chaplains' work with officers de-emphasizes the differences between 
religious groups, Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They drop that at the door," Smith said. "Officers talk to them as a 
chaplain, not as a Baptist minister or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Ron Ruby, who helped organize the chaplain program in Torrance, said 
its members fill a void. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police officers are basically caring people, even though sometimes they 
appear to be very hard," Ruby said. "When these tragedies happen, the officers 
feel that they have to deal with the facts and get the situation resolved . . . 
but it does take an emotional toll on the officers."  
</P>
<P>
 The officers who have been counseled by the chaplains have had nothing but 
positive things to say about them, Ruby said.  
</P>
<P>
 People in law enforcement need a place to talk about their experiences, said 
David W. DeRevere, director of the International Conference of Police Chaplains 
and a chaplain for the FBI.  
</P>
<P>
 "We teach our police officers that they are in charge. The cop is supposed to 
be able to handle it. What do they do when they have a problem?" he asked. "If 
a chaplain can be available who has earned their respect and trust, then a cop 
has someone to turn to." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the department also contracts with professional counselors in 
particularly difficult situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance gives its chaplains 20 hours of training as reserve police officers. 
They study radio procedures, report-writing and techniques for restraining 
suspects. Experts give them some points on relating to police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really understand what the officer goes through," Mayeda said. "I see it 
as empathy training." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they do not carry guns, the chaplains spend time on the firing range 
learning how to handle a weapon in case an officer drops one in a scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could use the gun to protect their own lives if they had to," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaplain's equipment is limited. On ride-alongs they wear a bulletproof 
vest, but most of the time their uniform is a blue wind breaker similar to what 
police officers wear during a raid. Big yellow letters across the back read: 
"CHAPLAIN." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope that people that see (the jacket) don't misread it for 'CAPTAIN,' 
" Holbrook said.

ELECTIONS; GOP EFFORTS TO UNSEAT REP. HARMAN MOVE INTO HIGH GEAR; RANCHO PALOS 
VERDES COUNCILWOMAN SUSAN BROOKS AND FORMER PALOS VERDES ESTATES COUNCILMAN RON 
FLORANCE SEEK REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For months, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks has canvassed South 
Bay's supermarkets and landmarks in her bid to unseat Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Marina del Rey). 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' opponent in the Republican primary, former Palos Verdes Estates 
Councilman Ron Florance, already has hung 1,000 signs throughout the 36th 
District, which stretches from Marina del Rey to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates, the only two Republicans to enter the race by last week's 
filing deadline, are quickly spreading their names and messages outside the 
peninsula. But political analysts agree that the winner of the GOP's June 7 
primary must not only emerge from that race relatively unscathed, but will 
likely face another hurdle in seeking to unseat Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can establish name recognition," said H. Eric Schockman, a USC 
political science professor who has been following the race. "But you can't 
just let the voters know who you are. You've got to convince voters that there 
is a good reason to vote against an incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be a tough task, he said. When Harman announced her reelection bid 
two weeks ago, she already had a war chest of almost $500,000 and the 
endorsements of the South Bay's top aerospace executives. Even former Torrance 
Mayor Katy Geissert, a Republican, has crossed party lines and plans to back 
the first-term congresswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a betting man, I would say that Jane Harman is sitting very pretty 
right now," Schockman said. "But I know that you can't get too cocky this early 
in the race." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is split almost evenly between the parties, with 40% registered 
as Republicans and 39% registered as Democrats. In the 1992 election, Harman 
benefited when Republicans divided over the issue of abortion. Both Brooks and 
Florance are abortion rights supporters, as is Harman, which could make the 
issue moot. But this year's GOP challengers are not 100% harmonious. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, a former special education teacher, said Florance is the 
"old-fashioned Republican" who is depending on money and political handlers to 
carry him to victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Florance, an investment banker and financier, chipped in $150,000 of his own 
money for the race and estimates that he will have a war chest of $250,000 by 
the end of the month. Brooks has put $13,000 of her own money into the race, 
bringing her total raised to $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heart of our campaign is people, the heart of Ron Florance's campaign is 
money," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Florance defends spending his own money, saying it is proof to potential 
contributors that he is committed to the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Brooks) can beat Harman," he said. "I don't think she has the 
broad-based financial support to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, who reported spending $1.6 million to win the seat in 1992, declined 
to say how much she planned to spend on this election, but said it would be an 
expensive race.  
</P>
<P>
 By June, Florance said he hopes to raise $500,000, a sum he said will be 
necessary to mount a serious challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do that by knocking on doors," he said. "You have got to go to the 
media to get the message across." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, either Republican could have a tough time if the California economy 
shows substantial signs of improvement by November. Harman, who voted for 
President Clinton's budget plan, says that such an economic turnaround will 
prove she made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "My budget vote, which is controversial, will prove to be a wise vote," Harman 
said. "(The) $500 million in deficit reduction, some of which has already 
occurred, I think is spurring the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brooks and Florance point to Harman's budget vote as one of her 
shortcomings. Both cite a Heritage Foundation study showing that the South Bay 
district will be hit with $1.1 billion in new taxes over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery "is the (Bush) Administration reflecting on the economy right 
now," Brooks said. "Over the long run, the tax plan will have a negative 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Florance agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have a tax package," Florance said, "the (economic) cycle would 
be even more robust." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Republican candidates, in fact, are casting Harman as an 
inside-the-Beltway, Washington insider who sides with Clinton on almost all 
major votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jane Harman talks conservative Republican and then votes Clinton, tax and 
spend liberal," he said. "Jane Harman votes 90% of the time with the Clinton 
Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brooks: "She speaks just like a Republican. But she has a very different 
agenda than she espouses to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, however, denies that she gives blind support to the White House. She 
points to her efforts to seek greater cuts in the budget, which Clinton has 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subliminal theme (of her opponents) is: I am a Democrat and this is a 
district for Republicans," she said. "I am a representative, and I have fought 
for people who happen to be Democrats, Republicans and independents, with good 
results." 
</P>
<P>
 Also running in the 36th district are Libertarian Jack Tyler, Green Party 
candidate Robert (Bob) Long, and American Independent Joseph (Joe) Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 35th District, which includes Hawthorne, Inglewood and Gardena, 
Congresswoman Maxine Waters will run unopposed in the Democratic primary. Nate 
Truman is the sole Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th District, which includes Wilmington, Carson and Harbor City, 
freshman Democrat Walter R. Tucker III is being challenged by Democrat Lew 
Prulitsky, a real estate broker. Libertarian Guy Wilson also is running. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 38th District, which includes part of San Pedro and Wilmington, 
Republican incumbent Steve Horn will face John B. Duke, a Caltrans consultant, 
in the primary. Cypress College professor Peter Mathews will run uncontested in 
the Democratic primary. Also in the race are Libertarian Lester W. Mueller and 
Peace and Freedom candidate Richard K. Green.

SIGHTS; VENTURA ARTIST DRAWS ON VIDEO TECHNOLOGY; STEVE KNAUFF'S LABYRINTH 
FILLS THE ART CITY II GALLERY SPACE WITH SPRAWLING PLYWOOD CONSTRUCTIONS 
HOUSING CHEAP TV SETS. 
</P>

<P>
 Info. It comes at us from all sides, whether we want it or not. Info is spit 
in our faces with such regularity and vehemence that it tends to cancel out its 
own best intentions, becoming a blur instead of a focused, pressing concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost by necessity, artists with any modicum of social awareness have to face 
the question of how to deal with info age stimuli. They must decide whether to 
make their art an arcane refuge from data, to lash out against it or to embrace 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura multimedia artist sTeVe Knauff responds to these questions with a firm 
all-of-the-above. 
</P>
<P>
 As seen in his installation at the Art City II Gallery, Knauff draws directly 
on television/video technology in his work, even as he attempts to dismantle 
the mythology and preconceptions built up around TV culture. 
</P>
<P>
 This calculatedly cacophonous exhibition, entitled "RETRO-gradations: 
Regurgitated Relics from Fading Memories. . .," is what the artist calls a 
"sub-retrospective." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, an elaborate labyrinth, consumes and alters the gallery space with 
its sprawling, funky constructions housing cheap TV sets galore. Architectural 
elements, mostly the utilitarian plywood, provide a physical, real space 
counterpoint to the ephemeral TV-based material. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the work in this show dates back to a 1979 photograph called 
"Mutant in Search of the Answer," depicting a precariously perched TV set. 
Later, Knauff evolved from two to three dimensions as he literally found set-up 
TV sets in precarious positions in galleries, while shuffling video info on 
those TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Knauff's own search for an answer took him to UCLA, where he earned his MFA 
last year. One of the primary elements of Knauff's thesis exhibit at UCLA, and 
a centerpiece -- or command post -- of this exhibition, is "Countdown 2,000: 
Listen/Believe-Gotheamericanway." 
</P>
<P>
 The large eye-shaped booth is lined with shelves of videotapes of taped news 
broadcasts from every day since Knauff's 30th birthday. The artist's intention 
is to mark time, as in a countdown, to his 40th birthday, coinciding with the 
change of the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, we find works consisting of performance props -- such as from a 
version of Beckett's "Breathe" done at Art City -- and other 
installation-minded pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Knauff's videographic materials run a gamut from "objective" input -- TV news, 
a bikini contest, Angie Dickinson -- to the documentation of his own art 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 And in "Familiar Illusions" we meet the subject, and it is us. In this 
interactive setting, an overhead camera captures the viewer, but only when he 
or she stands in a position where pitchforks and strapped-on TV sets dangle 
overhead, seeming to pose a threat to safety. The camera apparatus itself has 
an imposing, artillery-like quality, referring to an underlying issue for 
Knauff -- the invasive nature of media. 
</P>
<P>
 If info arrives in carefully designed, self-contained chunks, Knauff's art is 
nothing if not unfinished and lined with funk. 
</P>
<P>
 Knauff is an artist for whom ellipsis dots are highly useful. Observe the 
title of his show or this statement describing the nature of its contents: " . 
. . a roaming band of fragmented relics, like 'marauding nomads' of 'set-like' 
ruins . . . but, big, archaic things that take up a lot of space . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Conceptually oriented and process-minded, he is scarcely concerned with 
conclusive, declarative, polished statements. He doesn't even seem concerned 
that technical difficulties disrupt the functionality of his pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the notion of machinery -- and systems -- being prone to breaking 
down are key to Knauff's aesthetic. For him, the slick and seemingly pragmatic 
parade of electronic culture is leading society on a crash course -- a course 
that can then be fed back into the info machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than being didactic or alarmist about his message, Knauff maintains a 
sense of humorous cool about his work. He devises clever contraptions that 
incorporate info bits and technology, while keeping his guerrilla wits about 
him. ON A LIGHTER NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, at the generally more mild-mannered Buenaventura Gallery, Mona 
Neuhaus shows watercolors that may be the diametric opposite of sTeVe Knauff's 
work. Each to their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Neuhaus traffics in perfectly pleasant, horizontally formatted images of rural 
splendor and wide open spaces in such places as Santa Ynez, Wyoming and 
Yosemite. They brush across the viewer's senses like a pollen-less breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Also notable in the outer gallery are the vivid, neo-Fauvist images from Gayel 
Childress' "Ojai Landscape" series, and Jane McKinney's dream-fed outdoors 
image, "Walking to Grant Park." CENTER-ING ART 
</P>
<P>
 Gerd Koch, who has taught at Ventura College for some four decades now, 
remains one of the bright lights in the ranks of Ventura's painting community. 
And works such as the generous selection currently showing at the Ventura 
County Government Center, are very much about the pure power and wonder of 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 In these large, energetic abstract canvases, hints of landscape settings and 
natural forms are enveloped in vigorous ambiguity. On the surface, he taps into 
an abstract Expressionist syntax of robust brush strokes and drips, but these 
paintings also manage to allude to the lyricism of Impressionism -- such as 
with the Monet-esque "Spring -- A Walk By." 
</P>
<P>
 Less like Monet, ironically, is "Monet's Pond," which looks like a detail of 
an Impressionist painting greatly blown up and pumped up with bravura color. 
Somewhere in the tension of what these images are and how they're generated 
lies the secret to their allure. Details

PLAN FOR HOMELESS ANGERS RESIDENTS; HOUSING: A COALITION VOWS TO FIGHT A 
PROPOSAL TO CONVERT EMPTY NAVY BARRACKS TO A SHELTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the one week since San Pedro residents discovered that a homeless shelter 
is proposed for surplus Navy housing in the middle of a residential area, they 
have turned their anger into a united front, vowing to halt the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and real estate agents formed a group, Concerned Citizens, just 
days after they found out that Turner's Technical Institute, a homeless 
advocacy organization based in South Central Los Angeles, planned to run the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical plans to run a housing program for up to 600 homeless 
people in 144 units of Navy property at 2300 Taper Ave. The plan already has 
been approved by the federal Health and Human Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned Citizens countered by distributing 4,000 flyers by early this week, 
rallying 1,000 people to protest the plan Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Community opposition is not a case of just saying "not in my back yard," 
residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is 'San Pedro Cares,' but we've done more than our share," resident 
Bonnie Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The community was not told about the plan before approval was given, and it 
already has a number of homeless shelters, subsidized housing programs and 
churches that feed the hungry, residents said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city of Rancho Palos Verdes has rallied behind the movement to stop the 
housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 At its own meeting Tuesday night, the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council 
unanimously agreed to begin lobbying Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, 
the League of California Cities and the secretary of the Navy. It is also 
looking at possible litigation, Mayor Steven Kuykendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The community meeting, at Dodson Junior High auditorium in Rancho Palos 
Verdes, was so crowded that dozens of people had to listen to the four-hour 
meeting from outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders and individuals heatedly voiced concerns about interfering 
federal bureaucrats, secretive local politicians, crowded public schools and 
collapsing real estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know someone personally who was going to write up an offer (to buy a house) 
until this hit the paper and she decided not to put an offer on the property," 
said Ann DiBernardo, of the San Pedro-Wilmington Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't willing to move her family into San Pedro until she was sure what 
was going to happen with that area." 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy is closing down the Long Beach Naval Station and will move out 
enlisted personnel and their families from 44 buildings on the 27-acre site, 
which is surrounded by single-family homes in San Pedro and Rancho Palos 
Verdes.  
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, homeless advocacy groups such as Turner's Technical 
Institute are given priority on federal land that has been declared surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health and Human Services Department decides which organization gets the 
property and has already approved the Turner's application to use the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical is not required to get permission from the community, and 
the Navy "can't arbitrarily overturn the decision by HHS," said Long Beach Navy 
spokesman Lt. Carl Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy prefers that all parties come to an agreement or compromise before 
we give our stamp of approval. Obviously, we recognize that that might not be 
possible in all cases, and we can't delay these matters indefinitely because 
that wouldn't be in keeping with the spirit of the legislation," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical Institute made an impassioned plea for community support. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives say the housing will be used for an atypical group of homeless 
families and individuals, those displaced by natural disasters or the recession 
who are too proud to seek welfare help. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the site would be gated, and no foot traffic to or from the premises 
would be allowed. A committee with community representatives would rigorously 
screen applicants, and no substance abusers would be taken into the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical Institute will hold its own meeting to address public 
concerns at Dodson Junior High on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Concerned Citizens group said it will continue its opposition with 
petitions and more gatherings.

SOUTH BAY BEACHES IN DANGER OF LOSING LIFEGUARD SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors drew a line in the sand this week over funding 
for lifeguards on South Bay beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 4 to 1 to pull lifeguards off seven state beaches, including 
Manhattan and Redondo, this summer if local agencies do not pay more money for 
the county services. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is facing a $900-million budget deficit. Officials will give the 
state formal notice that it can no longer afford to provide any lifeguard 
services to state beaches after July 1. Funds spent for cleaning beaches also 
would be pulled. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguard services on six city-owned beaches, including Hermosa Beach, Avalon 
and Torrance, could be pulled on April 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Beaches and Harbors Department, which hires lifeguards for the 
beaches owned by the state, cities or county, is facing a $1.3-million budget 
shortfall and has requested an increase in funding from South Bay beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
 City councils in Manhattan and Redondo have balked at those requests, saying 
only a fraction of area beach users reside in their cities, and citing concern 
over the future of county demands for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 The county hopes city and state officials will attend a public hearing to 
discuss possible resolutions to the matter, said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for 
the Beaches and Harbors Department. A hearing has not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Deane Dana, who represents the South Bay beach cities, voted 
against cutting off lifeguard services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's truly a matter of public safety," said Don Knabe, a spokesman for Dana. 
"You can't just leave the beaches blank." 
</P>
<P>
 The county pays $1.8 million a year to operate Manhattan Beach, one of 
Southern California's busiest beaches. The city contributes about $220,000 a 
year, which it collects from parking meters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real unfortunate that it's gotten to this," said Manhattan Beach Mayor 
Steve Napolitano. "We want to cooperate but I haven't seen any long-term plan 
that guarantees what services our money would provide us." 
</P>
<P>
 Napolitano said he is confident that the state will protect Manhattan and 
other state-owned beaches if the county pulls out. State officials could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The county pays $603,000 annually for services in the state-owned portion of 
Redondo Beach. The council voted against boosting the city's annual 
contribution from $140,000 to $200,000 in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring an agreement with the county, Redondo Beach officials will consider a 
variety of options, including city operation of lifeguard services, said City 
Manager Bill Kirchhoff.

WORDS & IMAGES: SCREENWRITER-PRODUCER PENS MYSTERY; DAVID DEBIN, WHOSE CREDITS 
INCLUDE GAME SHOWS, SITCOMS AND FILMS, WILL BE AT MYSTERIES TO DIE FOR.

<P>
 In the early days of Hollywood, the studio moguls lured respected novelists to 
the West Coast to write screenplays. They came for the money, and they were 
accused by New York literati of selling out. They even accused themselves of 
selling out. 
</P>
<P>
 So when successful screenwriter-producer David Debin (a new Santa Barbara 
resident) starts writing novels, he need not fear the money-grubbing label. His 
credits include game shows, made-for-television movies, sitcoms and films. He 
also co-wrote the first draft of the movie "Dick Tracy," which was sold to 
Universal. 
</P>
<P>
 Debin's first mystery thriller, "Nice Guys Finish Dead," introduced the 
irreverent journalist-crime fighter Albie Marx. His second Albie Marx mystery, 
"The Big O," published by Carroll & Graf, is a wild romp about Hollywood deal 
makers and their world. You get to guess who the book's characters are in real 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Debin will be at Mysteries to Die For, 2940 Thousand Oaks Blvd., Thousand 
Oaks, at 1 p.m. Saturday.

GROUP RALLIES TO CLEAN UP ALLEY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of residents on Gardena's northernmost border say they are tired of 
being neglected by City Hall and the Police Department and have formed a 
community organization to try to rid their neighborhood of crime, trash and 
transients. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of apartments along El Segundo Boulevard say city response has 
been dismal to their calls about speeding cars, vehicle burglaries and a recent 
influx of transients who residents say have set up camp in an alley in the 2100 
block of the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Hardgraves, a 19-year resident of the area, said she got the runaround 
at City Hall when she called initially last fall to ask for help with half a 
dozen transients living in apartment complex carports opening onto the alley. 
She eventually was told to report the transients to police, who would 
occasionally come to shoo the transients away. But the alley-dwellers always 
return, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Roderick Ewell, a 10-month resident of the area, said that he never 
sees police patrolling there and that officers are slow to respond to calls. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of residents were upset recently when it took officers more than an 
hour to arrive after four cars were burglarized, Ewell said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The lighting is terrible here, and we have guys drag-racing down the middle 
of the alley," he said. Ewell, a Baptist minister who works for a regional 
anti-gang program and is the father of a 1-year-old boy, continued: "The city 
has shown they don't care at all." 
</P>
<P>
 When residents complained at a recent City Council meeting, officials reacted 
with surprise, saying this was the first they had heard of problems in the 
area. Police Chief Richard Propster said he would look into the complaints, and 
council members vowed to help the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members also questioned why they hadn't heard from the residents. 
"We can't respond unless people let us know," Councilman James Cragin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, residents are trying to do something on their own, Hardgraves said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 neighbors gathered Saturday to pick up trash, trim bushes, sweep 
carports and ask transients to leave. Hardgraves said residents referred the 
transients to shelters and social service agencies, but the police were 
eventually called when a couple of them refused to budge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hated that we had to do this, but they can't be living there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The resident turnout was so impressive that Hardgraves said she hopes to 
organize neighborhood cleanups every month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caught on like wildfire," she said.

NIGHT LIFE: WHAT'S IN A NAME? NASTY JACK MEANS SOLID ROCK; THE BAND SOUNDS OFF 
WITH STRONG '70S-STYLE ROCK 'N' ROLL THAT'S REMINISCENT OF THE BEST GROUPS OF 
THE ERA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the rock band Nasty Jack, there's a Dave, a James, a Jon, a Bryan and an 
Armando, but no Jack. As to the adjective, well, this is a family newspaper, 
and we don't mean the Borgia or the Manson family, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Name confusion should come as no surprise. After all, there were considerably 
fewer Maniacs than 10,000 and all the Ramones have the same last name. It's 
just rock 'n' roll, not truth, or even math. In any case, Nasty Jack will be 
playing at the Midnight Hour in Ventura on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasty Jack has been around since late 1990. Founding members Bryan Peiffer 
(guitar) and Dave Greene (voice) were in the military and played at a 
retirement party on the base at Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first gig, a few members have come and gone, including the last bass 
player, who is going to become a police officer, and may some day be pounding 
on the door to rehearse his turn-it-down-or-else speech. In addition to Greene 
and Peiffer, Nasty Jack these days is James Hairabucci on drums, Jon Raffetto 
on bass and Armando Moreno on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they play tight '70s-style rock, which Hairabucci finds altogether 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the attraction of '70s style rock is the fact that is has never 
really gone away," he said. "You can always hear Aerosmith, Bad Company and 
Zeppelin, always. Dave and I pretty much grew up with that stuff. It's more 
early '80s stuff for Bryan and later '80s stuff for Jon and Armando. I think we 
sound like all the '70s super groups." 
</P>
<P>
 If you need proof as to the year you are living in, just ask those radio 
programmers who play "Stairway to Heaven" every hour whether anyone needs it or 
not. Since '70s-style music won't die, there must be a lot of people out there 
embarrassing their pets in the privacy of their own homes by playing air guitar 
even as they wear out both Boston albums.

 "I think Ventura is a closet rock 'n' roll town," said Hairabucci. "Sometimes 
people dance when we play, but basically, I think people are too shy to dance 
to rock 'n' roll, except for those upbeat dance bands. We don't do Chuck Berry 
or Jerry Lee Lewis rock 'n' roll; we're a heavy, guitar crunch, big downbeat 
kind of band, which is kinda hard to dance to. But I can see a lot of people 
nodding their heads when we play." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that Nasty Jack doesn't have fans. They do. The band has a 
mailing list and a monthly newsletter, a hot line number (659-6652), and plenty 
of short-haired followers who work for Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got about 200 people on our list right now," said the drummer, "even 
though it's sort of a hit or miss thing. I think some people just want to get 
something in the mail, but it works really well for the Navy people." 
</P>
<P>
 Nasty Jack is working on a CD that they hope to issue later next year. 
Meantime, they have a couple of tapes, with the latest, "Naked," nearly a year 
old. They're considering doubling that one by adding four more songs and 
reissuing it. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no shortage of Nasty Jack songs to choose from; they have some 45 
originals. Live, one of their few covers is a reverential rendition of "I'd 
Love To Save The World" by Alvin Lee and Ten Years After. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the bill at the Midnight Hour is Aerial, formerly Ariel, then Blender. 
In any case, it's Eric LeMaire doing some serious alternative guitar rock that 
really rocks. Details

EDUCATION; PENINSULA HIGH: LATIN FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, the ancient language of Latin is 
anything but dead. 
</P>
<P>
 About 165 students study the language, and the school has one of the largest 
Latin clubs in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasm for the language and Latin history, music and art will be shared by 
about 1,200 people Friday and Saturday when students from throughout the state 
gather at the school for the 39th Annual California Junior Classical League 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time the high school has held the event since its 
inauguration in 1955. Organization has taken a year, but the work has been 
worth it, said teachers McNir Maxwell, Denali Poliakoff and Rosalind Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell said the convention is a mixture of academic and sport competition 
with recreational activities. Events include certamen (a quiz game similar to 
"Jeopardy") and chariot racing.

<P>
 Supt. Michael W. Caston of Palos Verdes school district will soon leave the 
area that gave him his first teaching position in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Caston will leave his post April 6 and step in as superintendent of the Santa 
Barbara School District on April 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Caston said his resignation had probably surprised colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great opportunity to take on a bigger district and it's a beautiful 
area . . . (but) it's been a positive time here and it's with mixed emotions 
that I'm leaving," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caston grew up in Torrance and later attended El Camino College. He started 
his teaching career at the peninsula's Miraleste High School and then served as 
assistant principal and principal in the Capistrano School District in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1980 to 1990, he held both assistant superintendent and superintendent 
positions in the Covina School District before his appointment to Palos Verdes.

NOT THE TYPICAL WEDDING VIDEO: TWO WOMEN EXCHANGE VOWS; 'CHICKS IN WHITE SATIN' 
COULD RECEIVE AN OSCAR FOR BEST SHORT DOCUMENTARY AT MONDAY'S ACADEMY AWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GILDEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts and a few grandparents 
wereassembled in a half circle around a television and videocassette recorder 
in a large meeting room at the Ventura Church of the Foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 This eclectic group of about 40 ran the gamut from freshly scrubbed 
twentysomethings to at least one octogenarian. In the center of the proceedings 
were Harold and Suzanne Stern of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the video of their daughter Debra's wedding that was first on the 
evening's playlist. Shot by Elaine Holliman, a student filmmaker from USC, the 
film is more than just a standard wedding video. 
</P>
<P>
 Holliman's documentary skillfully guides the viewer through the evolution of 
the relationship. The young couple speak to the camera about their decision to 
wed and about breaking the news to family members, who are also interviewed. 
The camera captures the couple as they prepare for the wedding: registering at 
The Broadway, writing invitations, going through premarital counseling with the 
rabbi. The denouement is, of course, the ceremony and reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold and Suzanne play featured roles in the film as the parents of one of 
the brides. They beam proudly at the end when the audience breaks into 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicks in White Satin" is the title of Holliman's film. It has screened at 
the recent Sundance Film Festival and the Berlin Film Festival, and could 
receive an Oscar for best short documentary at the Academy Awards on Monday. 
Disney's Hollywood Pictures is even negotiating to turn it into a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an atypical wedding video certainly because of the professional quality 
and because of the critical attention it is attracting. But it is also atypical 
in that it is about two women -- Debra Stern-Ellis, a Camarillo High School 
graduate, and her partner, Heidi Stern-Ellis -- who decide to formalize their 
eight-year relationship by getting married. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold and Suzanne Stern are sharing the film this night with fellow members 
of the Ventura County Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG), a 
support group of parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, children, friends and anyone 
struggling with the often difficult discovery that someone they love is gay or 
lesbian. Their meetings are held the first Tuesday evening of the month at the 
Church of the Foothills and are strictly confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriage between two people of the same sex is not legally recognized in 
California. There are, however, eight municipalities in the state, including 
Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Laguna Beach, that offer some degree of 
recognition for same-sex unions. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no such municipalities in Ventura County, according to Neil 
Demers-Grey, president of the Unity Pride Coalition, a human rights group in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put this issue before the cities of Ventura County, proposing a 
redefinition of the term family to include domestic partnership rights for city 
employees" in January, 1993, said Demers-Grey. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no response from nine of the cities, he said. And from Ventura, the 
10th, he received a letter signed by Ventura City Manager John Baker stating 
that monetary concerns prevented the city from changing benefits for any 
employee group. 
</P>
<P>
 For many gay and lesbian couples, the lack of support they receive from their 
communities is just a larger echo of what they have grown to expect from their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my daughter unconditionally," said Suzanne Stern during a seminar 
recently in Thousand Oaks. "But that doesn't mean I said, 'Oh great!' when she 
told me she was gay." 
</P>
<P>
 The path traveled by Suzanne Stern, who is now eager to accept her daughter's 
sexuality, was not without pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne was almost 40 years old and Harold was nearly 50 when Debra was born. 
She is their only child, although each has children from previous marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know how I and everyone else in the family was going to handle 
this," said Suzanne. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra was attending UC Santa Barbara at the time she disclosed her sexuality 
to her mother. She scheduled an appointment with a psychologist in Santa 
Barbara to help her mother deal with some of the inevitable feelings and 
emotions such a pronouncement can create. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne came around soon after, but father Harold, a deeply religious man and 
a practicing Jew, had still not been told. And he was not to know for another 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time she told me I said, 'Oh, well, it's your life, if that's the 
way you want to live,' " said Harold. "Then I went home and really stewed about 
it for a few weeks. (The next time I saw her) boy, I let her have it!" 
</P>
<P>
 "With both barrels," said Suzanne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even remember all the things I said," said Harold. "But then I 
started reading about sexual orientation and learning about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "And we talked . . . and we talked . . . and talked, and I said, 'Harold, I'm 
not going to lose her,' " said Suzanne. 
</P>
<P>
 And the two found their way to the Ventura County chapter of PFLAG, in search 
of other parents of gays and lesbians who understood what the Sterns were going 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are parents who have accepted who our children are and have gone beyond 
that (to helping others)," said Sandy Yost, president of Ventura County PFLAG 
at a recent seminar in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children agonize before telling their parents," said Yost, whose son is gay. 
"It hurts me when parents don't realize their children are hurting. Don't worry 
about what the person you play bridge with says." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just give up your child because they don't live the lifestyle you 
think they should live," said Suzanne. "Parents don't need to approve. They 
just need to accept." 
</P>
<P>
 When Debra got down on one knee and proposed marriage to Heidi in 1986 while 
they were living together in Santa Barbara, neither had a clear vision of what 
that would entail. They had been a couple two years, since Heidi was 19 and 
Debra 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her I took that very seriously, but I couldn't conceptualize in my 
mind how we would do that," said Heidi, who now lives with Debra in San Diego, 
where the two are social workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Debra, whose mother had seven years to adjust to the idea of her 
daughter marrying another woman, Heidi's mom, Parris Treen of Tulare, learned 
of her daughter's sexuality only about a year before the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The year before I told her was a really hard year for us," said Heidi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so angry. She was a wreck. It's so hard when you don't tell your 
family," said Debra. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjustment for Treen was not an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I couldn't even think about it without crying," said Treen. "I was 
very negative about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The commitment ceremony and the making of the film were helpful in her 
eventual acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the real thing that helped was the shower," said Treen. "I knew 
there was this massive family (of Debra's) out there." 
</P>
<P>
 At the shower held by a cousin of Debra's, Treen got the chance to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 Treen's transformation from a mother who wants to understand to one who is 
accepting of her daughter's sexuality is perhaps one of the most poignant 
moments in "Chicks in White Satin." Her growth is documented almost step by 
step in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can go through what I went through, anyone can," said Treen. "It's 
nothing but good if you can just accept your children."

Q&A; CITY PROSECUTOR IN SAN PEDRO GETS TOUGH ON JAIL TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ted Eden, 48, recently took over the San Pedro branch of the city attorney's 
office. As supervising deputy in the harbor area, he decides which cases will 
be prosecuted. Most often his caseload is filled with vandalism, theft and 
domestic violence cases, which are among the more common crimes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you see your job? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, the city attorney's office in San Pedro is responsible for 
prosecuting misdemeanor crimes that occur in Harbor Gateway, Harbor City, 
Wilmington and San Pedro. Felonies are prosecuted by the district attorney's 
office in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 My job is to convict people and to protect the public. I don't develop grudges 
or hatreds against people, but I'm unforgiving in the prosecution of people I 
think are guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And how would you describe yourself? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Myself? Well, I'm relaxed and easygoing. I like to believe people will do 
what's right because they're supposed to. You cannot presume that they're going 
to fail -- you have to give people a chance. Also, I'm truthful and 
intelligent. I'm kind to children and I like dogs.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you from this area? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I grew up in San Diego, one of eight children raised by a mother who 
worked at a laundry. To make ends meet I would work at a tuna cannery. That's 
probably why I like San Pedro. This waterfront and the fishing boats remind me 
of my childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 We were poor, but we've all turned out well, I think. I just bought a house in 
Woodland Hills, but I like it here. I'll probably move to San Pedro later on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of crime is most prevalent in the harbor area? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The way crime affects citizens directly -- and this is really everywhere, 
not just in the harbor area -- is that most often it comes from people they 
know. If you look at situations where innocent bystanders are hurt, the really 
violent types of crime, such as gang crime or drive-bys, usually affects 
innocent bystanders when they happen to be around violent gang members they 
know. But drive-bys in the harbor area are down 86% because the gang truce has 
been holding so well. And a woman, for example, (is statistically) in more 
danger in her own home than she is outside -- it's more likely that someone she 
loves is going to beat her up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about graffiti? There is a major concern in the harbor communities 
about cracking down on taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Graffiti, of course, is a problem. But it's not the worst problem. It's 
something we don't like to see. The office does have a history of prosecuting 
people who (deface) other people's property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think that putting people in jail is a deterrent to crime? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, I really think it is. For most people, just having the run-in with an 
officer and going to jail makes them ashamed enough that they don't want it to 
happen again. Remember, the great majority of people who commit crimes do not 
become repeat offenders. Only 25% of all criminals are repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 I think jail time works because it's so unpleasant. You lose any say over your 
own life: You get up when someone else tells you to, you get dressed when 
someone tells you to, you do everything when someone else tells you to. It 
smells, it's overcrowded, it's dangerous and the food is bad. Also, you don't 
get control of the remote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is jail appropriate for all offenses? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I tell you, I used to believe that for a first-time offender you could go 
easy on them. But now I think that if someone is convicted of a crime they 
should spend some time, even a little time, even if it's only a few days, in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you always pretty much of a hard-liner? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I'll give somebody a chance sometimes. If a public defender comes to me 
and convinces me that the suspect is really going straight, I'll sometimes go 
along with probation. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'll suspend the full sentence so that if they're not serious about it and 
they violate their probation or they're arrested again in six months, well 
they're going to max out on jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does rehabilitation play a role in the penal system? Can you punish and 
rehabilitate someone at the same time?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Punishment has its purposes, but I don't think you should punish a person 
thinking they'll be rehabilitated. That's not going to happen. I would much 
prefer to see the system deal with rehabilitation rather than punishment, but 
that's not plausible right now. There simply isn't money in the system for 
those kinds of programs.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many cases does the Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division 
send to the city attorney's office for prosecution each month? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If the rate remains the same, (as it has been in recent months), I'd say 
Harbor Division sends about 300 cases to the San Pedro city attorney's office 
and about 230 of them are brought to court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you keep track of how many cases you win? Your conviction rate? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If an attorney can tell you how many cases they've won or lost it means 
they're dumping cases to make their rate higher. I think attorneys who can tell 
you their conviction rate are despicable. Ted Eden Background: Ted Eden, the 
new supervising deputy city attorney in the harbor area, has a bachelor's 
degree in business administration from San Diego State, a master's degree from 
Indiana University at Bloomington and a law degree from UCLA. He rose to the 
position in San Pedro by trying cases in virtually every branch of the city 
attorney's office throughout his 13 years with the department. City Atty. James 
Hahn said he chose Eden for the position because in addition to his lengthy 
experience as a trial attorney, Eden's unflappable manner and poise make him 
ideal to supervise the office.

THEATER NOTES; ACTOR BOLDLY GOES INTO 'THE TIME MACHINE'; WALTER KOENIG, WHO 
PLAYED CHEKOV IN 'STAR TREK,' WILL APPEAR IN A STAGED READING OF H. G. WELLS' 
CLASSIC NOVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems as though Walter Koenig can't get too far from science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor, who broke through with his portrayal of Ensign Pavel Chekov in the 
"Star Trek" television series, keeps returning to the future -- in the highly 
popular series of "Star Trek" feature films, writing science fiction-oriented 
comic books and novels, and writing and/or appearing in television shows with a 
science-fiction bent. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, he'll be appearing at the Westlake High School auditorium 
in a staged reading of H. G. Wells' classic novel "The Time Machine." The 
performance will benefit the Santa Susana Repertory Company, members of which 
will co-star with Koenig under the direction of Lane Davies. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig grew up in New York City and attended Grinnell College in Iowa as a 
pre-med major. After "discovering that I could never match the textbook 
examples with my organic chemistry experiments," he transferred to Los Angeles, 
graduating from UCLA with a degree in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he'd been cultivating an interest in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd played leads in two plays in high school and performed in 'Morning 
Becomes Elektra' at Grinnell after discovering that I had a feel for acting, 
and that I was getting some social reinforcement -- I was something of a 
wallflower," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Koenig's UCLA professors wrote a letter of introduction to the 
Neighborhood Playhouse back in New York City. Koenig's classmates during the 
two years he spent there included stars-to-be James Caan, Christopher Lloyd, 
Dabney Coleman, Brenda Vaccaro and Jessica Walter. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving back to Los Angeles, Koenig began to land television roles including, 
prophetically, a defecting Russian student on the high school-set "Mr. Novak." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an interesting variety of roles," he said of those days. "If there was 
one common aspect to the parts I got, it was that many of them were ethnic -- I 
was an Arabian rock 'n' roll singer in 'I Spy.' And I was always playing parts 
younger that I really was. Chekov was supposed to be 22 when I started playing 
him; I was 32 at the time." (He's now 57). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, Chekov joined the crew of the USS Enterprise as assistant navigator 
just in time for the show's second season and remained on board for the 
remainder of the show's brief run; it was canceled by NBC, due to poor ratings, 
two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 When the show left the air, Koenig said, he was despondent. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 'Star Trek,' I found myself totally at sea," he said. "I had no reason 
to get up in the morning. . . . By that time, though I could no longer play 
juveniles, I was not seen as physically mature enough to play doctors and 
lawyers." Too, he said, "typecasting may have played a part." 
</P>
<P>
 He began writing, contributing scripts to various '70s series, including 
"Family," "Land of the Lost" and "The Incredible Hulk." 
</P>
<P>
 He also began work on a novel, "Buck Alice and the Actor-Robot," which he 
described as "a strange, satiric fantasy about the world being invaded by 
aliens and the only people left were losers. Writing it was great therapy, and 
I got it published 18 years later." 
</P>
<P>
 He also returned to the local stage, directing shows around Los Angeles, and 
teaching acting and directing at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig must have been at least as surprised as anybody else when, in 1975, he 
heard that Paramount Pictures, which owned the failed TV series, was about to 
make a "Star Trek" movie -- prompted, he assumed, by the success of George 
Lucas' "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig signed on, and the film became a franchise -- "Star Trek -- the Motion 
Picture" spawned five sequels (the last in 1991) and led to the TV series "Star 
Trek -- the Next Generation." While the Enterprise crew seems to have retired 
at last, there has been talk that several of them might appear in the first 
"Next Generation" feature film. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'Next Generation' film originally included all of us in the forward," 
Koenig said. "More recently, it was down to Bill (Shatner), Leonard (Nimoy) and 
DeForest (Kelley). Leonard has made it clear that he won't do it; Bill, who has 
the biggest part, probably will." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without "Next Generation," Koenig's connection to "Star Trek" and science 
fiction continue. He and Mark Lenard (who played Mr. Spock's father in "Trek") 
occasionally tour in the play "The Boys in Autumn." Koenig has also written 
several issues of the comic book series "Raver," which he created, and he has a 
recurring role in the "Star Trek"-influenced TV series "Babylon 5." 
</P>
<P>
 But his Trekkie days may finally be over. Now, he said, he is "very 
comfortable about moving on. For years, I felt that I was on one end of a very 
elastic umbilical cord that would stretch but not break. But now I feel 
comfortable away from the series and would prefer to spend what time I have 
left in other areas." Details

 Officials plan to make $75,000 in repairs to the popular swimming area, where 
a mechanical water system was damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
Concrete in the lagoon, which is near King Harbor, also crumbled in the quake.

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members rejected a proposal to move supervision of the city's 
crime prevention program from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to 
City Hall after citizens blasted the idea at Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff report recommended cutting city costs by about $52,000 by eliminating 
one of two sheriff's deputies who run the Community Watch program and hiring a 
civilian, who would work out of the city's Public Safety Department, at a 
salary of $34,160. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident James W. Gaines spoke against the change. He said the extra training 
sheriff's deputies receive and their knowledge of criminal behavior could not 
be replaced by a civilian worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't throw away a wheel that's already invented," Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Council voted 4 to 0 to maintain the deputy's position. Councilwoman 
Sylvia L. Muise-Perez was absent. MARY GUTHRIE

 The growing problem of illegal cabdrivers operating in Los Angeles was 
highlighted last week with the conviction of a Santa Monica company that 
dispatched a taxi into Los Angeles without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Service Co. and its president and chief financial officer, Mehdi 
Charmchi, 27, had been charged with three counts of operating without a Los 
Angeles franchise and proper permits, said Ted Goldstein, a spokesman for the 
Los Angeles city attorney's office.A municipal judge ordered Charmchi to pay a 
$13,510 fine after he pleaded no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles requires taxi permits to ensure that drivers have insurance and 
their cabs meet safety standards. Some illegal cabdrivers have been found to 
take advantage of patrons, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are ruses for taking patrons on rides where they find themselves robbed 
and stranded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Department of Transportation estimates that illegal cab operations 
have more than doubled in the last five years, from 400 to about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation department began investigating Best Service, also known as 
Best Yellow Cab, in 1992 after receiving complaints from licensed cabdrivers.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators posing as patrons conducted stings from Nov. 4, 1992, to Oct. 
29, 1993. DAMITA J. QUASHIE

 West High School won second place in the 15th Annual California Academic 
Decathlon state finals in Stockton. Archrival Taft High School of Woodland 
Hills came in first, and Laguna Hills High School took third place. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth year that West has made it to the state championship, and 
decathlon coach George Floratos said he was a little disappointed his team 
didn't win the competition last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really expected them to win this year," said Floratos, who teaches science 
classes in addition to coaching the team. 
</P>
<P>
 West scored 46,278 points out of a possible 60,000. Taft earned 48,974 points 
in the two-day testing, often called "The Battle of the Brains." Nine-member 
teams from each school include three A students, three B students and three C 
students in grades 10 to 12. Students with the highest point totals are 
eligible for scholarships at the University of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Floratos said the rivalry between the first- and second-place teams was 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think universally if you asked the (West) kids, they would say we're glad 
it was them since it wasn't us," Floratos said. The Taft and West students 
spent much of their free time together, and even mingled on the winners stand, 
hugging each other and trading high-fives. MARY GUTHRIE

<P>
 City Atty. Michael Adamson has been fired by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 After a public hearing followed by a closed-door meeting Monday night, the 
council voted 4 to 1 to dismiss Adamson effective March 25.Councilman Steven 
Andersen cast the dissenting vote, maintaining that Adamson had performed well 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Glen Shishido will continue as acting city attorney until 
a permanent replacement is found. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members remained tight-lipped at Monday's meeting about precisely why 
they fired Adamson, a 17-year veteran of the city attorney's office, saying the 
action was a personnel matter.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Councilwoman Ginny M. Lambert said last month that the council's plan 
to fire Adamson was linked to allegations by some council members that he had 
acted improperly to restructure his employment contract. The contract allowed 
Adamson to receive cash for a percentage of unused sick leave and vacation 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 In a public hearing Monday night, Adamson disputed those allegations and said 
he is the target of a political vendetta by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a termination clause in his contract, Adamson will continue to 
receive his monthly salary of almost $9,000 for six months. SCOTT SANDELL

ANIMALS: SOME STEPS TO PREVENT CRUELTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do the Easter bunny a favor this year. Fill the kids' baskets with chocolate 
eggs and marshmallow chicks. Pile on the jelly beans.But leave out the live 
rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the message Camilla Ribeiro-Kulin wants to send to those planning to 
make gifts of bunnies to children who may be ill prepared to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago Ribeiro-Kulin and her husband, Michael Kulin, founded the South 
Bay Rabbit Society, a group dedicated to rescuing mistreated and abandoned 
lagomorphs from Marina Del Rey to Long Beach. The results of pet neglect are an 
all-too-familiar consequence of the holiday as far as she is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very small percentage of rabbits sold at pet stores actually end up having 
a good life. A lot of them die," she said. Many are dumped at shelters. Still 
others are set free in vacant lots to face starvation and predators like cats. 
</P>
<P>
 The 150-member South Bay group, working with the national nonprofit House 
Rabbit Society, rescued 93 bunnies last year alone. "That's just scratching the 
surface of the problem," Ribeiro-Kulin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Properly trained rabbits make great housemates according to the Kulins. Their 
Manhattan Beach house serves as burrow for 35 rescued rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 In its foster care system, the South Bay Rabbit Society currently shelters 
about 70 animals in need of permanent homes and holds monthly adoption days for 
potential owners. But Ribeiro-Kulin warned those intent on having a rabbit for 
Easter that they are not buying a toy. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people are shocked when we tell them a bunny can live to be 15 years 
old," she said. "When people know what they're getting into, they decide not to 
or become more committed."

MEDIA: COVERAGE OF POLICE KILLINGS IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fear. I'm not afraid of going to the mall, to work, conducting my day-to-day 
activities -- whether it be during the day or the evening.I am not afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I am afraid of what I am reading in the media: the questions and 
innuendoes by the press and public regarding the circumstances surrounding the 
death of David Fukuto, who murdered two police officers at the Holiday Inn on 
Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 What would you do if an armed person entered your home or place of business? 
Would you not, at the first opportunity, try to disarm and subdue the 
assailant? I would and so would you. You and I would use any means necessary to 
protect ourself and others. 
</P>
<P>
 How can our police continue to protect us from increasing violence in our 
society if we cast suspicion on every move? The press and the public yell 
"civil-rights violation," but David Fukuto voluntarily surrendered his civil 
rights the moment he opened that hotel meeting room door. What about the police 
officers' right of peaceful assembly? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of casting suspicion on those who lay down their lives daily to 
protect us, we need to look at ourselves. How many officers have we lost in the 
past year? Nine. Don't kid yourselves. It's a war out there. Any one of us 
could be the next victim. The troops need our support!

COVER STORY; REAL ESTATE'S REALITY CHECK; AS THE INFLATED HOME PRICES OF THE 
'80S BOTTOM OUT, BUYERS AND SELLERS TAKE STOCK OF THE SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Software engineer Chris Farrar put his three-bedroom Hawthorne home up for 
sale three weeks ago, but even at $84,000 less than he bought it for five years 
ago, he's not sure he'll find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel administrator Penny Polston closed escrow on her Torrance home last 
Friday, but it sold for less than what she owed on her mortgage. She got 
relief, however: She worked out a deal with her lender to forgive part of her 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Business manager Kathleen McNamara once thought the $600,000-plus luxury homes 
in Torrance's Pacific Colony were well out of her reach. But at an auction in 
January, she bought one of the gated community's homes at almost half off, and 
moved in last month. 
</P>
<P>
 How's the local housing market? It depends on if you are a buyer or a seller. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the South Bay, dreams have been fulfilled or fortunes have been 
busted. For buyers, there are bargains to be had, as many experts predict that 
prices are at or near rock-bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the unfortunate seller, success is just staying afloat. And many of 
these sellers, especially those forced to move because they lost their job or 
are being relocated, often leave the South Bay with maxed-out credit cards, a 
hefty tax bill and a feeling of disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the younger, first-time buyers (from the late 1980s) are kind of beat 
up emotionally," said Torrance tax attorney Tim Moore, who gives seminars to 
those who face selling their home at a loss. "They saved up for years to buy 
their home, then lost (the equity)." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, home prices continued to fall. According to Dataquick, the 
average median price of a previously owned home in the South Bay dropped 7.3% 
to $237,400 in the fourth quarter of 1993 from $256,200 in the same period a 
year earlier. Values have fallen almost 20% since the fourth quarter of 1990, 
according to Dataquick Information Systems, which analyzes government records 
of completed transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many properties upside down right now," said Donna Shultze, a 
broker at Century 21 Union Realty in Torrance. The bright side is that families 
who before couldn't own a home are "now realizing the American dream. But some 
of those dreams are at the expense of the seller." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers who stand to lose the most are those who bought when home prices were 
at their peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, or those who added to their 
mortgages by taking out home equity loans, said Torrance real estate broker 
Robbie Mills.  
</P>
<P>
 Farrar, the Hawthorne homeowner, bought his home to gain equity after years of 
renting. He liked the quiet location on 140th Street and the layout of the 
house. It was built in the post-World-War-II-boom era of the late 1940s and 
featured hardwood floors. Paint and stucco work have masked similarities to the 
other tract houses on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told that it was the type of house to own to see an appreciation of 
property values," said the 38-year-old Farrar, who is single. 
</P>
<P>
 As his employer, NCR Corp. El Segundo, began cutting back its staff a year 
ago, he considered selling. But he was in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew property values had gone down," he said. "I just hadn't realized they 
had sunk that much." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when his firm offered him a separation package in December, he grabbed 
the chance, fearing that his options would only worsen as the company further 
cut staff. And recently, he found a job at Tandem Computer Corp. in Cupertino, 
which led to him putting his house on the market. He bought it for $273,000. It 
is listed for sale at $189,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy at the peak, sell at the trough," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cupertino, he plans to rent for a while until he can save enough for 
another down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take me a while to recover, but I don't think it's diminished my 
interest in owning a plot of land, owning a piece of America, as they say." 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeowners are not as optimistic. Their houses, from ocean-view mansions 
on the peninsula to modest tract homes in Torrance, are worth thousands of 
dollars less than their mortgage debt.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have extremes of income in the South Bay, but it doesn't matter," Mills 
said. "I have seen people devastated by this. Their business went under, they 
got a divorce, their overtime got cut or they lost their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Mills helped a homeowner sell his property, which was worth 
less than he owed. The homeowner, who happened to be a banker, suggested that 
they negotiate with the lender to forgive the difference between the selling 
price of a home and the debt due on a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He walked me through it," Mills said. "I had no idea that you could negotiate 
with home loans." 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. Banks and other lenders have become more willing to forgo part of a 
homeowner's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice, called a "short pay," not only preserves a homeowner's credit, 
but saves the lender from paying legal fees for a foreclosure and then having 
to find another buyer for the house. Brokers estimate that 20% to 30% of the 
transactions in the South Bay last year involved a short pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for some homeowners is that they can face a hefty tax bill: The 
amount of debt waived is counted as income. And some lenders are more willing 
to forgive debt than others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, lenders said, 'Heck, we'll take the property back,' " said 
Moore, the tax attorney. "That was until they had more properties than they 
could deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Polston, the personnel administrator at Allied Signal Inc., owed $190,000 on 
her Torrance home, but closed escrow for $179,000 earlier this month after the 
bank forgave a portion of her debt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a big relief. Her ex-husband helped with the mortgage on her 
three-bedroom Reynosa Drive house while their two children were in school, but 
when the younger one graduated last spring, that aid stopped.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if I stayed there I could not afford it," said Polston, 40. "I can't 
make . . . payments on the mortgage on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 She tried to sell the house for $220,000 on her own last June, but had no luck 
finding a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then right down the street a home sold for $190,000, and that's when the fear 
started," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 In December she went to Mills, who helped negotiate a short-pay agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 Broker David Keller of Shorewood Realtors in Hermosa Beach has plenty of 
short-pay stories, which he dubs "Tales From the Crypt." One couple bought a 
condo in 1989 for $360,000. They sold it late last year for $257,000. The bank 
was unwilling to forgive part of the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is too happy when they lose $100,000," Keller said. "But they don't 
blame the agent for the price. They understand it's the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone qualifies for a short pay. Lenders tend to forgive the debt only 
for those who can prove financial hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Bill Van De Water, whose income and assets disqualified him for a short 
pay. He moved his family to Georgia in September to open a factory for his 
Compton-based aerospace plant. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he and his wife had put $515,000 into their Palos Verdes Estates 
home. They bought it in 1984 for $290,000, and spent another $225,000 to 
refurbish it.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were only going to do the bathroom and spend $35,000," he said. "But we 
found it was one gyration after another. Someone must have looked the other way 
when it was built. Even the chimney wasn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, however, he had no choice but to move, he said. It was too costly 
to expand his company in Los Angeles. They put the house on the market for 
$600,000, but got no offers. Brokers said that the price would probably have to 
be about $450,000. Van De Water said that would not be enough to cover his 
loan.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can't sell it, and you can't keep it," he said. "And you can't turn it in 
to the bank without hurting your credit. It's a Catch-22." 
</P>
<P>
 Van De Water is making mortgage payments on the home and his Georgia 
residence, which he bought last fall. It's expensive, he said, but he doesn't 
want to sell at desperation prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Many middle-class families in the South Bay see the price erosion on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula as a godsend: Now they can afford to live there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exciting thing is that we're getting new, younger families moving on the 
hill," said Carolyn Malmquist, an agent at RE/MAX Palos Verdes Realty in Palos 
Verdes Estates. "We need that for our schools, businesses, and for the whole 
energy of the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Sala was packing up her Redondo Beach home last week to move to a 
house in Rancho Palos Verdes with her husband, Kevin, and their two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we could never afford it," she said. "We're taking advantage of a 
down market." She declined to say how much they paid for the new home. 
</P>
<P>
 They are moving to a smaller house, but it is near a canyon and has more 
privacy, plus better schools, Sala said. Their Robinson Avenue home, in an area 
dubbed the "TRW Tract" because of its proximity to the defense giant, was sold 
in four days earlier this month. Sala declined to reveal the price. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not losing money," Sala said. "We're making money because we bought 
before the market peaked." 
</P>

<P>
 Buyers are looking at other parts of the South Bay as well. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dataquick, the sales of previously owned single-family homes in 
the South Bay edged up 4.6% to 1,497 in the last three months of 1993, compared 
to 1,431 the same period a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 In February, real estate firms reported record numbers of transactions, 
perhaps because a small increase in interest rates prompted buyers to act. It 
was the eighth straight month that sales were up in Southern California, 
according to Dataquick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had one case where a home got four offers above the price where it was 
listed," said Larry Moore of Moore and Associates in Torrance. "That's not a 
normal thing. You have to go back to 1989 to find that." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Jacoby, 30, a Manhattan Beach computer consultant, made six offers in 
the past few weeks on homes in Rancho Palos Verdes, Redondo Beach and Torrance. 
He and his fiancee have been edged out on five, and are waiting to hear on one 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just totally amazed," said Jacoby, who has been renting an apartment. "I 
can't believe that there are so many people back in the market. You hear so 
much about aerospace downsizing. And you don't see many companies hiring a lot 
of employees." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other buyers who currently own homes are willing to sell to move up to better 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara, the business manager, just put her Brookside Village condo up for 
sale in Redondo Beach. She's asking $195,000 for the three-bedroom unit. 
Although she bought the place for about $172,000 seven years ago, she spent 
$18,000 to fix it up, and at one point in the late 1980s, similar condos 
fetched $265,000.  
</P>
<P>
 McNamara has a pressing reason to sell: At an auction in January, she bought a 
brand-new four-bedroom home in the Pacific Colony, a gated community off 
Torrance Boulevard in Torrance. Her price: $345,000, about half of the asking 
price in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the homes two years ago, and thought, 'What a joke! $600,000,' " 
said McNamara, a business manager who lives in her new home with her son. "I 
told my girlfriend that they would be auctioning these off two years from now. 
And they did." 
</P>
<P>
 The house has three bathrooms, a spiral staircase, a Jacuzzi and two 
fireplaces. The developer put it on the block to avoid foreclosure, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She may have to make payments on two places for the time being, but so far 
it's worth it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't sleep for a week after I realized what I did," she added. "I was at 
the auction, and all of the sudden I was writing a check for $20,000. But you 
have to take a chance. You have to know how to play the Monopoly game. That's 
what it is, a game. And this is my Park Place."

REWIND; LAUGHING AND CRINGING WITH CLEESE'S 'FAWLTY TOWERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Monty Python to "A Fish Called Wanda," John Cleese has specialized in 
portraying the repressed Englishman -- a part of him that he has struggled to 
overcome in his own life, he's said in interviews and in books. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all the emotionally straitjacketed characters he has created, none has 
come so tightly wound, or unraveled as spectacularly, as Basil Fawlty, 
proprietor of a small hotel in the English seaside town of Torquay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fawlty Towers," a BBC series of the '70s that still crops up occasionally on 
public television, is something like the TV equivalent of a train wreck: It's 
hard to tear your eyes away from Basil's self-destruction. To watch "Fawlty 
Towers" is to cringe and laugh at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleese made only 12 episodes of the show, six in 1975 and six in 1979. He has 
said it was simply too much work, with he and then-wife (and co-star) Connie 
Booth taking six weeks to write each episode. That attention to craft is 
evident in the work, a tight blend of broad physical comedy and acerbic verbal 
wit. 
</P>
<P>
 All 12 episodes are available on video in a boxed set, or on individual tapes 
of three episodes each. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the action, always, stands Cleese, a supernaturally lithe 
physical comedian who also has an unrivaled way with insults. He is by turns 
fawning, with guests he thinks that he should impress, and mockingly superior, 
with just about everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 His best asides are muttered under his breath to domineering wife Sybil, 
played wonderfully by Prunella Scales. Booth is Polly, the hired help who 
offers a bit of near-normalcy amid the lunacy; Andrew Sachs is Manuel, the 
inept but endearing Spanish waiter ("We're awfully sorry. He's from Barcelona," 
is Basil's ever-ready apology for Manuel's gaffes). 
</P>
<P>
 "Fawlty Towers" episodes "Communications Problems," "The Anniversary" and 
"Basil the Rat"; "Gourmet Night," "Waldorf Salad" and "The Kipper and the 
Corpse"; "The Builders," "The Wedding Party" and "The Psychiatrist"; "Hotel 
Inspectors," "The Germans" and "A Touch of Class." Each episode is 30 minutes.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; NEW SATELLITE SERVICE HEADED TO THE COUNTY; 
DIRECTV'S HIGH-POWERED EQUIPMENT WILL BEAM 150 SUBSCRIPTION CHANNELS TO SMALL 
ANTENNAS. THE FIRM HOPES TO HAVE 40% OF THE RURAL MARKET IN SIX YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Without the option of cable television, rural residents have been spared the 
endless reruns and infotainment kibble that would have lured them away from 
their bucolic splendor. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer. 
</P>
<P>
 A company called DirecTV will enter the cable television market in April with 
two high-powered satellites that will beam 150 subscription channels directly 
to small, low-cost antennas. Before DirecTV, only wealthy ex-urbanites could 
afford the $3,000 sticker on an eight-foot antenna, while the rural middle 
class was spared the temptation of frittering away its time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Satellites broadcasting to large antennas are generally 10 watts and analog," 
said Tom Bracken, director of communications for the El Segundo company. "We're 
going to be using a new frequency and broadcasting at 120 watts per channel. 
That allows us to deliver a digital signal to an 18-inch dish." 
</P>
<P>
 Bracken said his company hopes to have 40% of the rural market in six years. 
According to cable providers and census figures, 100,000 homes in Ventura 
County do not have cable access. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of back country innocence is the price of defense conversion. DirecTV 
is a subsidiary of Hughes Electronics, which has spent $600 million in its bid 
to enter the entertainment market. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seem to be offering a good product at a competitive price," said Steve 
Weingard, general manager of Century Cable in Ventura. "They're a real and 
viable competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 Weingard and other cable providers need not worry for the time being. DirecTV 
hopes for only 8% penetration in cable areas. The receiver and antenna will be 
sold by satellite dealers and at Sears and Circuit City stores, but at $600, 
city dwellers would really have to hate their cable company to switch. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If you're a fan of overlooked movies, there's a sleeper screening at the Ojai 
Playhouse this Sunday. "King of the Hill" is the picaresque story of a 
12-year-old boy growing up in a Depression-era transient hotel in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said that Jesse Bradford in the lead role delivers a thoughtful 
performance as a character scheming to stay one step ahead of events that are 
pulling his family apart. His mixture of vulnerability and resilience invites 
comparisons to the young hero in Truffaut's "The 400 Blows." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Steven Soderbergh ("sex lies and videotape") adapted the 1993 film 
from A.E. Hotchner's memoirs. It stars Jeroen Krabbe, Lisa Eichhorn, Elizabeth 
McGovern and Spalding Gray. 
</P>
<P>
 The screening is set for 4:30 p.m. at the Ojai Playhouse, 145 E. Ojai Ave. 
Admission is $6.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: A NEW SPAGHETTI FACTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the middle of a row of stores in Gardena's Pacific Square, surrounded by 
businesses with such names as Tokyo-Do Shoten, Hakugosha Cleaners, Murata Pearl 
and Heisei-Do Stationery, is a marquee that may strike some as strange as a 
sushi bar on the Via Veneto in Rome. The sign reads "spaghetti" and it heralds 
the restaurant Akane Chaya, which features more than 50 spaghetti combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, in Japan this would not be an unusual sight at all, because 
spaghetti is extremely popular there. Tadashi Kimura owned a spaghetti house in 
Osaka where he prospered for 12 years in fierce competition with dozens of 
rival spaghetti joints. Two years ago he moved to California and opened Akane 
Chaya, a modern, spare space with black chairs, Japanese prints, an open 
kitchen and jagged, dark wallpaper on roughly painted beige walls. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin your meal consider the steamed clams with sake ($5.80) or the baked 
mushrooms with ponzu ($5.30), a tasty dish featuring shiitake and oyster 
mushrooms in a refreshingly light sauce made of lime juice, soy sauce and rice 
vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, for a main dish the way to go here is the fresh spaghetti, which 
comes in 56 versions. The seafood spaghetti ($10) is topped with plenty of 
shrimp, clams, squid and octopus with a tomato sauce. Lucy, a frequent 
customer, whom I snagged to translate an interview with chef Kimura, said her 
favorite dish was the tarako - piripiri spaghetti, ($8.10), which features cod 
roe and red pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other popular selections feature the pasta mixed with bacon and mushrooms 
($6.80) and with cod roe, mushrooms and squid in a light cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also several rice dishes including mushroom and chicken curry rice, 
($7.30), seafood risotto ($7.50) with clams and shrimp, and an interesting rice 
pilaf with squid and cod roe ($6.80). 
</P>
<P>
 There is a short list of hamburgers and steaks, but that would be like living 
in Tokyo and ordering teriyaki. 
</P>
<P>
 Akane Chaya is at 1610 W. Redondo Beach Blvd., Gardena. 768-3939. Open Tuesday 
through Friday 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., Saturday 11 
a.m. to 10:30 p.m., and Sunday 12 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Closed Monday.

 PROTEST AVERTED 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers upset with playing conditions at Victoria Park in Carson have called 
off a planned protest at the course after the lease to operate the county-owned 
facility changed hands this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident pro Eugene Hardy said a group associated with Arnold Palmer assumed 
control of the course Monday, staving off a protest that was planned for 
Saturday by members of the Victoria men's golf club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've put (the protest) on hold," club president Benny Nickleberry said. "We 
need to give the new group a chance to come in and assess everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know that Victoria Park has the potential to be the best county golf 
course. It's just a matter of getting it in A-1 condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Nickleberry, a regular player at Victoria Park since 1968, said conditions at 
the course have deteriorated in recent years, prompting the golf club to 
complain to previous leaseholder Jim Duffin and write letters to county 
supervisors. Among other things, Nickleberry said the grounds have not been 
properly maintained and the pro shop offers little in the way of merchandise 
and services to golfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before learning that Palmer's group had purchased the lease, Nickleberry said 
the 150-member golf club was prepared to walk a picket line Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely going to close it down," Nickleberry said Monday. "We want 
to make a point. If the county continues to increase the rates and doesn't 
provide any additional services to the customer and make improvements on the 
golf course, we feel we need to hit them in the pocketbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Nickleberry estimated that the course would have lost between $8,000 and 
$9,000 if the protest was successful in keeping golfers away. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy, the resident pro since 1988, said he is optimistic that the new 
leaseholders will meet the golfers' demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "They plan on doing a lot of improvements and working with the county and the 
community," Hardy said. "I'm enthusiastic about it." GEARING FOR FINAL 
</P>
<P>
 Jesuit High of Sacramento, which will meet Crenshaw on Saturday in a rematch 
of last season's State Division I basketball final, has been getting 
outstanding play from forward Ben Ammerman, a Loyola Marymount recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7 senior had 14 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists Saturday in 
Jesuit's 79-72 victory over Oakland Fremont in the Northern Regional final, and 
he had 15 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and three steals Friday in an 80-58 
semifinal victory over top-seeded San Francisco Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 "His presence has been unbelievable," Jesuit Coach Hank Meyer said of 
Ammerman, who signed with Loyola in November. "He does so many little things." 
</P>
<P>
 Ammerman's duties include guarding the opponent's top front-court player, 
meaning he will probably match up against Crenshaw's Tremaine Fowlkes, a 6-7 
forward bound for California. Ammerman averages 15 points and eight rebounds on 
a balanced team. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesuit (31-6) and Crenshaw (28-2) will meet at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Oakland 
Coliseum. Crenshaw won last season's title game, 73-66. THE NEW ENGLANDER 
</P>
<P>
 Former Peninsula High basketball standout Matt Acres returned home last week 
for semester break after helping New Hampton prep school of New Hampshire win 
the New England Class A championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Acres, a 6-7 forward, was the third-leading scorer for New Hampton (23-2) with 
a 15-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Matt had a great year," said New Hampton Coach Mark Tilton, whose 
team was mostly made up of post-graduates. "He was one of the most improved 
kids we've ever had. He really stepped up his game." 
</P>
<P>
 Acres' family chose to send Matt to a prep school, and pay most of the $18,000 
tuition, in hopes of attracting college recruiters. He had virtually no 
scholarship offers after his senior season at Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 After a fifth year of prep competition, Acres has received offers from several 
lower- to mid-level Division I programs on the East Coast, including New 
Hampshire, Vermont, Rider, Monmouth and Siena. Rider will compete in the NCAA 
tournament for the second season in a row, and Siena was selected to the 
National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But Acres said he would prefer to attend college on the West Coast after 
experiencing a brutally cold New England winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to wait until after the signing period," he said. "Something might 
open up after that." ALL-STAR ACTION 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the area's top senior basketball players have been selected to play in 
the South Bay Athletic Club's fourth annual all-star boys' classic and 
inaugural girls' classic March 25 at South Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>

followed by the girls' game at 5:30, a boys' three-point contest and dunking 
exhibition at 7, and the boys' game at 7:30. Tickets will be sold at the door.

</P>
<P>
 At the request of Harbor District Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., the Banning 
High boys' and girls' basketball teams and their coaches will be honored Friday

</P>
<P>
 "I am very proud of these young athletes," Svorinich said. "Their victories 
have made all of Wilmington very proud." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive 3-A title for the Banning boys' team, coached by 
Marc Paez. The girls' team is coached by David DeLaby. HALL OF FAME

</P>
<P>
 The future appears bright for the Carson High basketball program after the 
junior varsity team won the Southern League title.

<P>
 The Colts (12-4) were 7-2 in conference play in their first season under Coach 
Wesley Green, including a victory over perennial power Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Standouts for Carson included sophomore forward Eric Burris and junior forward 
Motoa Towers. Both are expected to play next season for the varsity team, which 
was disqualified from the City 4-A playoffs after reaching the semifinals 
because of an ineligible player. THIS AND THAT

THEATER REVIEW; 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY' RETURNS WITH FRESH SONGS AND SKEWERS; 
'VOLUME 2' PRODUCTION TAKES DEAD AIM AT THE GREAT WHITE WAY'S PERSONALITIES AND 
PRETENSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dressed in her tattered rags, the forlorn beggar woman looks suitably earnest 
as the piano breaks into the opening bars of "I Dreamed a Dream" from "Les 
Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet instead of the expected tugs at our social conscience, what we get is a 
yearning ode to Broadway in its prime: 
</P>
<P>
 I dreamed a show in days gone by,  
</P>
<P>
 Where all the scenery looked so pretty,  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't sing one song then die,  
</P>
<P>
 And all my costumes weren't so gritty . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It can only mean one thing. "Forbidden Broadway" is back, hurling its dead-on 
satirical barbs at the bigger-than-life personalities and pretensions of the 
Great White Way. 
</P>
<P>
 As the song continues, the singer turns to the hypocritical hype that attended 
"Les Miz": 
</P>
<P>
 Come watch us grovel in the dirt,  
</P>
<P>
 Then buy a souvenir -- and darn it!  
</P>
<P>
 Rich folks pay twenty bucks a shirt  
</P>
<P>
 That has a starving pauper on it . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The wickedly funny parody lyrics bear the signature wit of creator Gerard 
Alessandrini, who updates his New York-based revue each year to stay current 
with the latest crop of Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The touring production of "Forbidden Broadway, Volume II," which arrives at 
Santa Barbara's Lobero Theatre for a single performance Friday, features some 
of the most popular numbers culled from the show's 12-year history, and is in 
many ways a retrospective of the Broadway musical itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Included will be parodies of classics -- "Evita," "Man of La Mancha," "The 
Phantom of the Opera," "Cats" and "The Sound of Music" -- as well as more 
contemporary pieces like "Will Rogers' Follies," "Aspects of Love" and "Miss 
Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like watching your favorite stars who've just been given a shot of truth 
serum," explained director John Freedson, who started out as a "Forbidden 
Broadway" cast member in 1984 and has been directing the authorized touring 
productions since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, he said, is an affectionate homage to the celebrities it spoofs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally, the lyrics step over the line, but that's usually because they 
make a good rhyme rather than because Gerard was feeling really vicious," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he added, being skewered in a "Forbidden Broadway" number has become 
something of a status symbol over the years. Rather than taking offense, 
celebrities are often the show's biggest supporters. Carol Channing, for 
example, appears on the company's latest "Volume III" soundtrack, in a number 
parodying herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephen Sondheim routinely sent us his music when it was finished," Freedson 
went on, "and he'd attach a note saying 'I know that you will want to parody 
this. Be as mean as possible.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The few objections to the show's use of songs have typically come from the 
estates of deceased composers, he said, but a notable exception is Andrew Lloyd 
Webber, who declared his Broadway scores officially forbidden after hearing 
Alessandrini's "Evita" satire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think that was fair since he stole so many of his own pieces from 
other people," Freedson said. "We got around the restriction by writing 
pastiche versions of 'Phantom' and 'Aspects of Love,' which aren't quite the 
Lloyd Webber tune but sound enough like it so they're recognizable." 
</P>
<P>
 But last week's Supreme Court ruling upholding 2 Live Crew's use of "Pretty 
Woman" should finally allow unrestricted use of even Webber songs as long as 
royalties are paid, said Freedson. "Now we can just say 'Here, we're using your 
tunes -- here's your check.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it takes more than clever lyrics to make a show like this work. Freedson 
stressed that the critical ingredient in "Forbidden Broadway" is the 
versatility of the cast. The four performers have to be good actors -- they 
must look and sound like the people they're imitating, with minimal costume and 
makeup changes. And they have to be superb singers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can't sing as well as the people they are parodying," he said, "the 
whole thing comes off sort of sour grape-sy." 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences, this week, can choose from two Southland productions -- Freedson's 
touring show appearing at the Lobero, and a version running April 6 through May 
22 at the Tiffany Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tiffany production, directed by Alessandrini, features the New York cast 
(currently on hiatus until enough new shows provide material for the next 
version). Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Forbidden Broadway, Volume II" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday at 8. 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC; HOLMES BROTHERS HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN BLUES; THE EASYGOING TRIO STARTED 
THEIR CAREER IN THE '60S, BUT DIDN'T RECORD UNTIL '89. THEIR LATEST, "SOUL 
STREET," CAME OUT LAST YEAR.

 Type A people dream of a James Bond-style cannon that would miraculously 
materialize from the hood of their Hyundai and blast that slow moving tourist 
ahead of them into the next time zone. "Slow" and "late" are not in their 
vocabulary, and their patience level can be measured by a decimal point 
followed by so many zeros. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holmes Brothers, definitely not a Type A trio, have the collective stress 
level of a stone. They'll be bringing their rootsy bluesy show to SOhO in Santa 
Barbara on Tuesday night, doubtlessly getting there by driving 55 m.p.h. or 
slower. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendell Holmes plays guitar; his brother, Sherman is the bass player; Popsy 
Dixon is the drummer. Everyone sings, and how. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holmes Brothers, based in New York City, are just your basic overnight 
sensations with 30 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have changed for us a lot because we used to do a lot of current 
covers, sort of keeping up with the Hit Parade," said Sherman Holmes during a 
recent phoner from Boise. "Now we play what we want to, but we still reach back 
sometimes. Going on the road is the only way we can work. We've been on the 
road about 200 days a year for the last five or six years." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the '60s, Wendell and Sherman backed up various R&B singers such as 
Inez Foxx and Jimmy Jones, then gravitated to New York City from their native 
Virginia. Eventually they played every venue and every dive bar in town. The 
current lineup has been together since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to do a lot of driving from place to place and we didn't ever fly," 
said Sherman. "Now we fly a lot. We're going to Australia soon. We've been to 
Europe, to Turkey, to Africa; we've been all over. We go to Europe four times a 
year now. They seem to appreciate us in Europe more than they do here because 
in America, we've got so much of everything. In America, we've got a lot of 
choices." 
</P>
<P>
 The Holmes Brothers had a choice, too. They opted for the kick-back, chill-out 
scenario -- they didn't record an album until 1989. Their latest, "Soul 
Street," came out last year on Rounder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we were busy playing and raising families, plus we saw a lot of bands 
make records that weren't successful," said the bass player. "So we finally 
made some records in our evening years. One night some record company guy saw 
Popsy and asked him who he played with, and the guy came to see us and gave us 
a contract. Right now, we're hoping for a second contract because our contract 
with Rounder has been fulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 The Holmes Brothers are masters of a variety of styles that are generally 
labeled roots music, encompassing all forms of indigenous American music not 
usually associated with Nirvana or Madonna. Most of their stuff has a blues 
base, but they do everything from straight rock to a cappella gospel music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play a mixture of a lot of different stuff," said Sherman. "If we played 
any kind of blues, it would probably be Piedmont Blues because we're from 
Virginia. We represent a good cross-section of roots music because we do 
country and Western, blues, soul and gospel music. Wendell and I grew up in the 
church; we were in the church chorus. At different times, we both were church 
organists. When I'm not playing, I listen to a lot of jazz, Sly & the Family 
Stone, and I listen to a lot of classical music, too. Then other times I don't 
wanna hear nothin." 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably because he lives in New York, a city not exactly known for the 
blues, though it probably ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know if there's such a thing as New York blues," said Sherman. 
"All I know is that you really should love what you're doing, and try to enjoy 
yourself wherever you are. You better choose your career very carefully. You 
must persevere and believe in yourself and develop your skills." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Holmes Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: SOhO, 1221 State St., Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Tuesday at 8 p.m.

FASHION; OVEREXPOSED SPRING STYLES SEND SOME RUNNING FOR COVER; THIGHS, NAVELS 
AND MIDRIFFS ARE ON VIEW IN SUCH WOULD-BE STAPLES AS THE MICRODRESS. BUT WOMEN 
MAY REFUSE TO BARE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As fashion analysts, it is our duty to warn you about spring. There's a new 
lookout -- and unless you're Barbie, our guess is you're not ready for it. 
</P>
<P>
 If last fall's wardrobe brought out the monastic mood, you could call this one 
the reformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers are baring more flesh than Vons. If you had to pick something out of 
Vogue magazine to wear to the office, we suggest stapling the pages together -- 
you'd get more coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 You will suppose we are exaggerating, but you will be wrong. Skirts have risen 
faster than the Missouri in flood stage -- to high-thigh levels. Necklines 
plunge. Midriffs, if they are covered at all, peek from behind misty gauze, 
brandishing navels like badges of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers seem to have missed a curve on the back-to-basics highway of the 
'90s and careened off into strange territory. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they've brought out the slip dress. Aptly named, it's a dead ringer for 
underwear. You could duplicate it in the lingerie department at a third of the 
cost. Better yet, check your grandmother's wardrobe -- some of these look like 
cotton relics from the '30s. Don't tell her why you want it, though. 
Grandmothers can be underwear reactionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 If you find that you are also one -- how about going for the microdress 
instead, which offers fancier fabrics but even less coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 There is obviously no way to sit down in this dress unless you are willing to 
tote along a briefcase to cover your lap. Or, perhaps, a parasol, for 
after-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Other offerings include the baby doll -- an official category -- and something 
we have termed the doily. They are not, shall we say, conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're here, anyway. We found some of these styles at Judy's in Ventura, 
where manager Melaina Hammonds said the slip dress is showing early signs of 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already sold three, and we are pretty tame," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hammonds, the clingy, short knit dress is also popular. She held 
up one that was not quite micro, but closing in on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a T-shirt until I pulled it out of the box," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A longer version of the dress is known as the tube -- and in a sheer weight it 
reveals as much as the micro, but under wraps, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Also featured are what seem to be exercise wear -- crop tops and short shorts 
-- but these are intended for the clubs, not the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with sample photos of the new clothing shown in Vogue and Allure, we 
approached some Ventura County women and asked their opinion of the look. The 
reception was cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be wearing my old clothes," Debby Maron, an aerobics dance 
instructor from Thousand Oaks, said after a quick glance at the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would wear it to bed," said Rachel Hawthorne, a student at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 Others had stronger views. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Andrews of Ojai, who works for the Ventura Unified School District, 
said: "These are from Vogue? They should be in Playboy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any need for it and I didn't when I was 20," said Marci Wagner, a 
masseuse who lives in Ventura. "Our society should be past this point." 
</P>
<P>
 She seemed so upset, we thought of offering her the parasol idea, but we could 
tell that she wasn't in the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes us wonder, though, whether the fashion world really has its finger on 
the pulse of America. How many women want to show this much skin? If they're 
into equality with men, shouldn't that translate to equal coverage?  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe fashion designers should do more marketing research before they hit the 
drawing boards: Check out the exposure quotient before the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 We think, given the responses from Ventura County, that they just possibly 
have . . . slipped up.

SHOP TALK; IN BASEBALL, MORE THINGS ARE COSTLY THAN PLAYERS' SALARIES;

 If we could hum the theme to "The Twilight Zone" we would. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because we just went shopping for baseball and softball equipment at 
several Ventura County retailers, and we felt as if we had entered a universe 
entirely different from the one in which we shopped during our younger days. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when bats were all wooden, and the most important factor in buying 
one was the star's signature burned into the barrel? Remember when you didn't 
have to choose between purchasing a bat and making a car payment? 
</P>
<P>
 Prices have changed considerably over the years. But so has the quantity and 
quality of baseball and softball goods. What hasn't changed is the desire many 
kids and adults have this time of year to purchase these products. 
</P>
<P>
 Brace yourself. Some of the prices may scare you, but now does seem to be a 
good time to start looking for deals. Last week, we found a considerable number 
of items on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start with T-shirts and sweat shirts, and some potentially good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rawlings sporting goods manufacturer was outbid a couple of years ago by 
Russell Athletics for the contract to make Major League Baseball uniforms. Now, 
Russell makes uniforms for all the pro teams. Russell also makes all officially 
licensed Little League uniforms -- jerseys, shorts, socks and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? Well, if you're lucky, you may find remaining Rawlings items out 
there for discount prices. Lewis Sporting Goods in Simi Valley, for one, is 
having a clearance on Rawlings shirts. Youth sizes are going at very low 
prices: cotton at $8, knit at $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, we found Nutmeg brand baseball sweat shirts on clearance at 
Sportmart in Oxnard. Attractive Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins hooded 
sweat shirts were down from $49.96 to $39.93. 
</P>
<P>
 As for caps, if you've ever shopped for one, you know that there is 
considerable variance in quality and appearance. Some are wool; some are 
cotton. Some look like those worn by the pros, some look cheap and many are 
somewhere in the middle and quite attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sportmart, we found cotton-polyester caps by Starter (a big name in the 
business) for $14.96, wool caps by New Era (another biggie) for $18.96, and an 
adorable kid-size twill cap of the Colorado Rockies for $12.96 (perhaps a tad 
high for someone whose head may soon outgrow it). 
</P>
<P>
 Dan's Sports in Simi Valley was having a hat clearance sale last week. An 
adjustable wool Oakland Athletics cap was marked down from $11.96 to $6.99 and 
a Florida Marlins cap had gone from $12.96 to $6.99. Dan's other caps, from a 
variety of companies, ranged from about $9 to $16. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two great deals we found: At Champs sporting goods store in the 
Oxnard Esplanade, a $9.99 Chicago White Sox cap was going for $3. At Lewis', a 
$4.95 Seattle Mariners cap was marked down to $1.99 -- worth the price even if 
you hate the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, here's what we discovered about aluminum bats: Cost is determined not 
only by make and model but, more importantly, by the quality of the aluminum 
alloy. The softer the alloy, the better the ball jumps off the bat and the 
higher the price soars with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bats would put a serious dent in your pocketbook, but we did find some 
good deals. At Champs, a nice Easton aluminum softball bat was marked down from 
$99.99 to $41.90 last week. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sportmart, the full-size aluminum bats go for anywhere from $39 to $150, 
quite an investment for older ballplayers. But even the lighter weight 
youth-size bats can be pricey. We found Easton Little League bats ranging from 
about $20 to $85. 
</P>
<P>
 On the lower end of aluminum bats, the store had a Wilson Little League bat 
for $15.97, a Spalding Little League bat for $14.94 and a Spalding T-ball bat 
(yes, aluminum even for T-ball) was going for $11.94. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if you still think its safe to let your kids play with good, 
old-fashioned wood, a Louisville Slugger T-ball bat was going for $8.97.

FOR THE KIDS; 'VELVETEEN RABBIT' WILL COME TO LIFE; CAL LUTHERAN'S CHILDREN'S 
THEATRE WILL PRESENT THE PLAY BASED ON THE CLASSIC STORY ABOUT FRIENDSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "The Velveteen Rabbit," that classic story about the stuffed bunny who comes 
to life, is back again -- this time on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 California Lutheran University's Children's Theatre is doing a stage version 
of the story, written in 1922 by Margery Wilson. The production opens this 
weekend and runs Saturdays and Sundays through March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you missed the original story, it's about a 4-year-old boy who gets a 
stuffed rabbit for Christmas. The bunny becomes his favorite toy -- so 
cherished that the animal becomes real to him. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boy contracts scarlet fever, his doctor orders the bunny destroyed 
because it is full of germs. How the rabbit escapes gives the story a poignant 
ending. 
</P>
<P>
 The play doesn't follow the story exactly. In this version, the boy is 
actually a girl named Stephanie, who, as an adult, is looking back 20 years on 
her childhood to the time she received the velveteen rabbit as a birthday gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same story line," said Ken Gardner, assistant drama professor at the 
university and the play's director. It still delivers a message about 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, written by James Still, has more dialogue, though, and a more 
contemporary feel. Gone is the nanny of the original story, replaced by parents 
who are heard but not seen. And the play includes a dance performed by the wild 
rabbits in the story. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast of 10 are CLU students, half of them drama majors. The older 
Stephanie, played by Ann Catalano of Fillmore, serves as the production's 
narrator. The younger Stephanie is Michelle Murray of Newbury Park. Holly 
Forsell of Santa Barbara plays the Velveteen Rabbit. Denise Santoyo of Oxnard 
is a doll in the child's bedroom. The set and the costumes were designed by 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The play runs 50 to 60 minutes and will be presented in the Preus-Brandt Forum 
on the Thousand Oaks campus. It's the second of two productions a year that the 
Children's Theatre puts on. This season marks the 27th year that the Thousand 
Oaks chapter of the American Assn. of University Women has backed the 
productions. 
</P>

 In Santa Barbara County, kids can tune into what's happening locally on the 
cultural arts scene through a program called Kids' Passport to the Arts. After 
nearly two years in operation, the program is now expanding into Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works. Kids join free and receive a monthly newsletter called 
"The Passport Express" that tells them about upcoming events they might be 
interested in, like a symphony concert or a museum exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-page newsletter is written mostly by kids 9 to 15 years old. It also 
includes reviews written by the young reporters, upcoming audition 
opportunities and a craft idea headlined "Just Do It." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, more than 2,000 kids in the Santa Barbara area get the newsletter in 
the mail. When they sign up, they also get a passport they can get stamped at 
cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 24 participating cultural organizations help fund the program. They also 
give ticket discounts to young members who attend their events. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricki Mazzullo, who runs the program, said it is just beginning to expand into 
Ventura County. Ojai Festivals Ltd. and Ventura Children's Festival have signed 
on, and she expects that more will follow. She is looking for young reporters 
in Ventura County to help with the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids' Passport to the Arts is funded in part by the Arts Partnership Grants 
Program, an offering of the Santa Barbara County Arts Commission. The idea 
behind the program is to make the arts more accessible to kids, and less 
costly.

A MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR WITH ETTA JAMES; MUSIC: THE RENOWNED VOCALIST'S RECENT 
COLLECTION REVEALS MUCH ABOUT THE INFLUENCES IN HER LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the notes to her new album, "Mystery Lady," subtitled "Songs of Billie 
Holiday," Etta James explains how, as a child, she would watch her mother, 
Dorothy, only 14 years her elder, prepare to go out for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Billie Holiday would be singing 'Fine and Mellow' on the scratchy phonograph 
as Dorothy painted her full lips with fire-red lipstick, powdered her face, 
snapped on huge hoop earrings, slipped into an elegant black dress and splashed 
on her midnight cologne. I can still smell it, still see her." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by these memories, James has crafted a collection of Holiday's music 
that reveals much about the three women. As she says elsewhere in the notes, 
"The mystery lady is my mother. The mystery lady is also Billie Holiday, who in 
so many ways reminds me of my mother. And I suppose the mystery lady is me." 
</P>
<P>
 James, who will sing songs from the album on her current tour, which stops at 
the Strand in Redondo Beach on Friday, is best known for her decidedly risque R 
& B presentations since her 1955 hit "The Wallflower" (given that title when 
the record company decided that the song's original name, "Roll With Me Henry," 
was just too suggestive). But her latest album shows her off as a serious 
ballad singer while providing a glimpse of the influences that guided her 
course as a vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone from her home in Riverside, James explains the effect Holiday's 
music had on that preteen girl growing up in Los Angeles, and what it means to 
her today. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, we could only listen to what she was talking about and say, 
'Yeah, right.' It was like somebody saying, 'Yeah, I hear you, but I don't know 
what you're saying.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about that song 'Don't Explain,' when she talks about lipstick on his 
collar" -- here she breaks into song -- " 'People will talk and you'll cheat, 
but that don't matter dear when you're with me.' When I was young, I thought, 
'Are you kidding? Don't explain? Boy, she's open-minded.' But now I understand. 
I've walked in her moccasins." 
</P>
<P>
 The path that James has followed to this point hasn't always been straight and 
narrow. But her perseverance, from her teen-singer days in a trio known as the 
Peaches ("we were black, we were women, we were winning all the talent contests 
in town, but that wasn't making us any money") and her discovery by Johnny Otis 
to some two dozen crossover hits in the '60s and her battles with poverty and 
drug addiction, has finally had its rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Her popularity soared again in the mid-'80s with the release of "The Early 
Show" and "The Late Show." 
</P>
<P>
 The last couple years have been particularly rewarding ones for James. She was 
inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame last year. MCA has released "The 
Essential Etta James," a collection of her Chess-label recordings of the '60s 
and '70s, joining "R&B Dynamite" (Ace), a compilation that chronicles her 
earlier work, including "Wallflower." 
</P>
<P>
 The new album, minus the rollicking, bawdy numbers on which she's staked her 
career, is a bit of a gamble.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be some controversy with this album," she said, "because 
it's more jazz. But I don't care what anybody else says." 
</P>
<P>
 James prefers that whatever else her life holds in store remain a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been the type to say 'Where am I going next?' or 'Will I win this 
Grammy or that?' Even when we were first starting out, I never thought what I'd 
be doing 50 years from now.  
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me what was it like in the fabulous '50s. Did you realize all the 
great things that were happening then? We didn't think anything about it at the 
time. It was just like fixing a plain old pot of greens and some corn bread. We 
didn't blow it out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 Etta James and the Roots Band appear tonight at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano, (714) 496-8930, 8 p.m., $25 (Coco Montoya 
opens); and Friday at The Strand, 1700 S. Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach, 
(310) 316-1700, 8:30 p.m., $25.

JAUNTS; SANITATION PONDS A BIRDS' PARADISE; A NATURALIST WILL LEAD A WALK 
THROUGH THE LARGE ODOR-FREE VENTURA COMPLEX, WHICH IS HOME TO HERONS, EGRETS, 
DUCKS, CORMORANTS AND OTHERS. 
</P>

 Bird-watching on the grounds of Ventura's sewage treatment complex sounds like 
an outing for only the most unflappable of bird buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vast sanitation operation near the Ventura Harbor includes a wildlife 
refuge with three ponds that draw a big bird population. And, happily, it's 
virtually odor-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Williams, a naturalist with the city's recreation department, is leading 
a bird walk around the ponds Sunday from 3 to 4:30 p.m. It's a chance to see 
herons, egrets, ducks, cormorants, maybe a turtle basking on a rock or a family 
of muskrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never know what we'll find," Williams said. Like the time one of her 
groups came across a turkey vulture feasting on a dead sea gull. It made a more 
lasting impression on the kids in the group than, say, the hundreds of coots, 
ducks and other birds that calmly cruise the ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk starts at the Surfers' Knoll parking lot, on the beach side of 
Spinnaker Drive where Williams leads the group through a locked fence. Inside, 
the three ponds cover a total of 34 acres. A dirt road, about one mile long, 
encircles them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not exactly a wilderness area with the harbor, sewage treatment plant and 
beach nearby. But it still has a secluded feel. Trees and bushes surround the 
ponds, animals skitter about and birds chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has an uncanny ability to spot birds that would go unnoticed by most 
people. She provides binoculars and spotting scopes for walkers to get a closer 
look. (The scopes work better for children who can't handle binoculars.) 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, she tosses out little informational nuggets: "The cormorants 
don't have oil glands to waterproof their wings, so after a dive they 
drip-dry." The coots: "They do this kind of Egyptian number with their necks." 
And the herons: They're one of the shyer birds, preferring the most remote 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The water in the ponds, built in 1973, has already been treated by the city so 
it is odor-free, except for a whiff of chlorine at one spot. The ponds are 
really reservoirs, supplying irrigation water for golf courses, parks and other 
properties. Whatever is left over flows into the nearby Santa Clara River 
estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, the city allows the public to walk out by the ponds. But 
visitors must first sign in at the administration building off Spinnaker Drive. 
Bird groups visit frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 The spot is also a cushy retreat for migratory birds that use the ponds as a 
stopping off place where they can rest and feed before resuming their journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "In January and February it's wall-to-wall ducks," Williams said. "It's 
incredible." As April approaches, some of the migratory birds are still laying 
over. Other birds stay year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams isn't just a bird buff. She has degrees in marine biology and 
environmental science; she has been a research scientist and a consultant for 
an oil company; she teaches at Oxnard College; and for the last four years she 
has led nature programs for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On the walk, she might talk about the disappearing wetlands in California. Or, 
the Chumash Indians -- how they used the nearby willow trees to build their 
homes. She might point to the blisters on the leaves of a willow where the 
sawfly has deposited its eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The walks attract families, as well as adults. Williams doesn't enforce a 
no-talking rule to enhance bird sightings; in fact, she gets a little exuberant 
when she spots a rare find. But she does have noise limits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discourage screaming." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Bird walk, approximately one mile. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Around three ponds on the grounds of Ventura's sanitation treatment 
complex near the Ventura Harbor. Group meets at Surfers' Knoll parking lot, off 
Spinnaker Drive, across from Ventura Harbor Village. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Sunday, 3 to 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $3 per person. Preregistration is required. Children under 5 are free, 
but must be in a child carrier because strollers are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC: Call 658-4726 for information. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: The wildlife ponds at the sewage treatment complex are open to the 
public during the week. Visitors must check in at the sanitation administration 
building, 1400 Spinnaker Drive. For information, call 562-4544.

PIECE OF CAKE; MORE PARENTS ARE OPTING FOR A NO-MUSS, NO-FUSS APPROACH TO

 Today, and every day, in Ventura County, there are 500 kids having a birthday. 
That means, of course, that at least 500 parents each day are searching for 
ways to celebrate the momentous event. 
</P>
<P>
 Having six, eight, 10 or more sugar-charged children in the house for several 
hours strikes terror in the hearts of many parents, especially those who have 
done it before. Besides the noise, chaos and general over-stimulation of the 
celebrant, there's the cleanup after they finally leave. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a way to do this so that you and the kids have fun, the guests never 
have to set foot on your new carpet again, and, best of all, there's no 
cleanup! 
</P>
<P>
 The out-of-home birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of local facilities providing birthday party services has grown 
significantly during the last few years, easing birthday woes for hundreds of 
weary parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Falat of Simi Valley, mother of Marykay, just turned 6, sees real 
advantages to celebrating birthdays outside her home. "They do everything for 
you," said Falat, who recently threw a party for Marykay at Paint Pals 
Clubhouse in Simi Valley. "They show the children how to use the paints, they 
serve everything, they clean up. It's a do-nothing party for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen-year-old Jennifer Curran of Westlake Village decided to have a 
bowling birthday party this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun, and gives everybody something to do," she said. Jennifer's mother, 
Janet Curran agrees. "They can entertain themselves, keep score on their own 
and it's a more adult-type activity." 
</P>

 The two-hour party at Paint Pals Clubhouse (Camarillo and Simi Valley) begins 
with each child's selection of a ceramic to paint. After donning smocks, 
birthday guests are shown to a table equipped with paint, brushes and a 
turntable and paint plate for each child. 
</P>
<P>
 When painting is complete, children may free play in the black-light or 
shadow-box rooms; encase themselves in a bubble in the giant bubble room; face 
paint; play with puppets, costumes or the giant kaleidoscope. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests then gather for karaoke singing and games before the birthday cake is 
served. 
</P>
<P>
 The guest-of-honor leaves a personalized hand print on the wall and guests get 
their ceramic as a party favor. Invitations are included. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: $6 per child up to 25 children, plus $30 service fee; for 25 or more 
children, the service fee is $50. Refreshments, paper goods provided by

AT THE MARKET: MARCH A GOOD TIME TO PURCHASE HEARTY NEW ZEALAND TEA TREE; THE 
EASY-TO-MAINTAIN EVERGREEN SHRUB IS DROUGHT-TOLERANT AND BLOOMS ALMOST 
YEAR-ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODNEY BOSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Covered most of the year by dainty, fruit blossom-sized flowers, the New 
Zealand tea tree is one of the best choices for gardeners in search of an 
easy-to-maintain shrub, according to local nursery staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 And right now is the best time to pick one up. 
</P>
<P>
 During March, nurseries and gardening departments stock up on the many 
varieties of this evergreen shrub -- botanically, Leptospermum -- while the 
plant is at its blooming peak. 
</P>
<P>
 For Southern Californians, there may not be a better shrub, said Hitoshi 
Fujii, a nurseryman at Ventura's Green Thumb International. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a native of New Zealand, the tree thrives in Southern California's 
moderate climate, Fujii said. "They do very well in dry weather," he said, "and 
you can expect them to bloom nearly year-round, except in midwinter." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Zealand tea tree -- so named because its leaves were once brewed as a 
tea to prevent sailors from getting scurvy -- are most commonly sold in one- 
and five-gallon containers, although the 15-gallon size is available at larger 
nurseries. Their blooms range in color from snowy white to variations of pinks 
and reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Because tea trees are in full bloom, now is a particularly good time to see 
exactly what you are getting, Fujii said. Sometimes the container label doesn't 
paint an exact picture: The "pinks" can actually be deeper in color and more 
rosy, while the "red" varieties can actually be more ruby and burgundy-hued. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the plant also varies depending on the variety. The tea tree can 
range in height from a dwarf size of about two feet, all the way to a small 
tree of 25 feet or more. Many are as big around as they are tall. All varieties 
feature tiny, densely set, needle-like leaves that also differ in color -- from 
dullish gray, green to reddish. 
</P>
<P>
 The tea tree is valued beyond its showy appeal for its usefulness in a 
landscape, said Kyle Puerner of Green Meadow Nursery in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are real suitable for hedges or screens," Puerner said. "Maybe there's a 
spot in your yard you want to screen out -- like between your yard and your 
neighbor's. Some of these are tight, tall growing shrubs that would work well." 
Other types with a more stunted growth are best suited for ground cover, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing a tree, you need to think about the location where it will be 
planted. For example, if you've chosen a spot alongside the house, near a 
window, beware of these fast-growing plants -- they could eventually obstruct 
your view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't put it anywhere that it needs to be pruned," said Nancy Downs of 
American Wholesale Nursery in Simi Valley. Heavy pruning will only serve to 
lessen the plant's attractiveness, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the plant to hack away at with a hedge shear, though selective 
pruning can help slow the plant's growth. But Downs said it's best to leave it 
be. "You just want to give it all the room it needs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following are descriptions of just some of the scoparium varieties -- most of 
which produce double blooms -- grown at Green Meadow Nursery and available at 
other nurseries and stores throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruby Glow": compact, upright six to eight feet tall, dark reddish foliage, 
profuse with deep red flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pink Pearl": six to 10 feet tall, blush pink to white flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snow White": compact, two to four feet tall, white flowers with green 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helene Strybing": six to 10 feet tall, this type features single, pinkish 
flowers that are larger than most others. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the New Zealand tea tree's best trait is its gardener-friendly 
reputation. It just doesn't take a whole lot to get these plants going, Fujii 
said. Beyond providing it a sunny spot where it will have good soil drainage, 
they can be pretty much left to fend for themselves, he said. In fact, too much 
water or over-feeding can actually harm the plant. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CAFE'S EXQUISITE EMPANADAS SERVED WITH SIDE OF FRUSTRATION; 
THE SERVICE IS SO-SO, AND HALF THE MENU ITEMS AREN'T AVAILABLE ON SEVERAL 
VISITS. WILL HE GO BACK? YOU BET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID B. GOLDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just what do you say about a tiny restaurant where the food is delicious but 
the service haphazard, and -- most frustrating of all -- half the items on an 
already limited menu are often not available? 
</P>
<P>
 What I say is that it's horribly aggravating, but I'd go back. The Argentine 
empanadas, which are meat or vegetable turnovers, and the vegetable and chicken 
pies at Ventura's Cafe Bariloche are good enough to keep drawing me there. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tiny, modest, 20-seat restaurant across the street from Ventura's 
downtown post office, owner Angelique Lopez is serving (in a sometimes 
scattered manner) some of the best, most traditional empanadas and savory pies 
this side of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuisine, it turns out, is a meeting of the minds -- and the recipes -- of 
Lopez and Italian chef Francisco Perry. This confluence probably accounts for 
traces of Italian touches in the vegetables, says Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He usually does what he likes," she noted. "It's the way he cooks, plus my 
own recipes." 
</P>
<P>
 None of this lessens my frustration. I went to the cafe several days in a row, 
looking for some variety. But was I able to eat tuna empanadas, or potato 
empanadas, or those made with broccoli, all of which are on the menu? No. Every 
day, the available empanadas were the same: vegetable, chicken, corn-pumpkin. 
</P>
<P>
 But what you get is so good. 
</P>
<P>
 When you order more than one empanada, the way to discern which is which is to 
consult the menus on the counter. On the back are diagrams showing that the 
vegetable model, for instance, is coated with poppy seeds, and that the crust 
on the chicken one is trimmed with a certain scallop design. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch one day, we sat scrunched into our seats, surrounded by surrealistic 
wall murals and with "happy rocks" on each table; the theme here is "the garden 
of earthly delights." Then the empanadas arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The empanada comes in an excellent homemade crust and is crammed with filling. 
The chicken version ($2) bulges with juicy, boned dark meat from the thigh, 
plus green bell peppers, onions, olive oil, herbs and spices. 
</P>
<P>
 It is moderately spicy and, although my tongue is still trying to figure out 
just what the spice is, Lopez claims that it's simply lots of pepper. The hot 
Argentine delicacy is filled with flavors that merge beautifully inside your 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The corn-pumpkin empanada ($2) is slightly sweet, with crunchy kernels of corn 
and the contrasting flavors of green and black olives, raisins, herbs and 
spices. Perhaps this one is best eaten first, since it is probably the mildest 
of the empanadas. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Bariloche also serves the best potato dish around -- surely the best in 
downtown Ventura. They call it bionic potatoes, and what you get is a large 
plate of big potato cubes, unpeeled, served hot and covered with the Cafe's own 
"Argentine sauce," a mildly spicy mixture of vinegar, olive oil and certain 
herbs and spices -- none of which Lopez will divulge, but from which sage and 
thyme seem to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to be able to say that the sandwiches on the menu are good -- or 
different, or distinctive -- and I bet they are. The cafe just has never had 
the Milanesa sandwich ($4.50), a thin piece of steak that is breaded and 
deep-fried, when I was there. Nor did it have the eggplant sandwich with the 
garden salad ($6.25). 
</P>
<P>
 I did get a couple of cracks at the veggie empanada ($2.50), which is simply 
outstanding. It's filled with fresh spinach and green and black olives, and 
also the usual herbs and spices, plus brown rice and, perhaps the most 
distinctive flavor -- fresh cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening, we showed up at Cafe Bariloche for dinner. I'd been looking 
forward to trying the beef and olive pie ($7.89). It was, the menu said, served 
with salad and bread and was full of all sorts of good things. No such luck. 
How about the turkey pie ($7.89)? The turkey had apparently flown south for the 
evening. More frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 So we ordered a few empanadas, the usual selection -- chicken, vegetable and 
corn-pumpkin -- and the only two pies available. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the pies arrived, and we were willing to forgive the fact that it took 15 
minutes to get something to drink, that one pair of empanadas may have arrived 
15 minutes after the first, and that the beef and olives pie was just not going 
to be here this evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The chicken pie ($7.89), a substantial dish in a hot, oblong casserole, is 
made with the thigh meat, with peppers, herbs, spices and onions, and covered 
with a crust of seasoned mashed potatoes. It's a hearty, very satisfying dish. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was its companion, the vegetable pie ($7.89), that is the single dish 
that would draw me back to Cafe Bariloche. And you're talking here to a 
red-meat guy. The pie has the same vegetable empanada filling -- the fresh 
spinach, olives, brown rice, zucchini and herbs. But the dish is served with a 
substantial layer of crisp mozzarella cheese -- I suspect this is the Italian 
influence of chef Perry. The spicing is just superb. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no liquor at all here. The drinks are things like mate green tea, 
espresso Bariloche or lemon tonic. Details

THE EMERALD STYLE; SOME PUBS HAVE THE LUCK TO BE GREEN-SPIRITED ALL YEAR-ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Back in the old country, St. Patrick's Day is still what it's always been: a 
religious holiday. On these shores, of course, the day has taken a different 
tack, becoming a raucous celebration of all things Irish and many things 
pseudo-Irish (green beer, anyone?), with sprawling parades in the Celtic 
strongholds of the East Coast and, more locally, copious drinking by folks who 
wouldn't know a shamrock from a shillelagh. 
</P>
<P>
 On St. Paddy's Day, virtually every bar, tavern and cocktail lounge fancies 
itself Irish for a day, blowing the dust off the old Dennis Day tapes and 
pulling the green streamers out of the storeroom. For some local public houses, 
however, being Irish is not a part-time occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those pub owners who go beyond the ubiquitous Irish name above the door 
and shamrock cocktail napkins find that there's more to creating atmosphere 
than decorative detail. The danger is creating a sterile shell that 
approximates a pub in Ireland about as well as Disneyland's New Orleans Square 
approaches the grimy bustle of the real Bourbon Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ireland, pubs run the gamut, from the standing-room-only watering holes of 
downtown Dublin (some with names immortalized in James Joyce's "Ulysses") to 
the more relaxed country spots, darkened enclaves warmed by turf fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are being dragged, reluctantly, into the modern age with the 
controversial addition of such items as jukeboxes, TVs and (gasp!) video games, 
but even these blasphemies cannot detract from the essential draw of the Irish 
pub everywhere: conversation, known there as "crack," a word that obviously has 
a different connotation here. 
</P>
<P>
 Pubs are the neighborhood's social meeting ground, and denizens of American 
bars might be surprised by the wide range of ages interacting in an Irish 
public house. The conversation is lubricated by some of the best beers 
anywhere, Guinness stout being among the best-known. Also, most pubs serve 
lunch, hearty meals that won't be mistaken for gourmet cuisine but can be tasty 
and filling -- and relatively inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging local pubs by the standards of their Irish models can be tricky 
business -- most try primarily to capture some of the spirit without worrying 
too much about slavish detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County does not have a large, concentrated Irish population, as some 
cities (such as Boston and San Francisco) do, but it does have a scattering of 
Irish immigrants, some recent and some long-established. One way to compare 
bars is to find out where the Irish drink, and the long-running leader on that 
account has been the Harp Inn in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harp, home-away-from-home for many local Irish and a regular venue for 
traditional music, has been featured often in the pages of this newspaper, so 
we'll concentrate on other places in the county -- including one up-and-comer 
that is challenging the Harp as the most "Irish" of the Irish pubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spotting the Shamrock Bar and Grill along busy West Coast Highway in Newport 
Beach can be a bit of a trick, tucked away as it is among a row of restaurants 
and other businesses with only a modest sign to mark it. Inside, it can look at 
first glance like any number of neighborhood taverns, cozy but unremarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 That impression soon gives way, however. First, there's the Irish lilt coming 
from both sides of the bar. Owners Christina and Frank Duggan are from 
Tipperary, and the crowd they draw is heavily Irish. Says Christina, "Sometimes 
people who come in here for the first time ask me, 'Did they make you talk like 
that to work here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The fare distinguishes the Shamrock as well. Bartender Mike Cathal knows how 
to pull a pint of Guinness, one with a dark, rich body and a dense foam head to 
rival any in the area. It's an art that takes years to perfect and several 
minutes to execute, so be patient -- it's worth the wait. It should be noted 
that the Shamrock uses the imperial pint (20 ounces) rather than the U.S. 
version (16 ounces). 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a full pub menu, starting with a traditional breakfast: imported 
Irish bacon and sausage, black and white pudding, eggs and brown bread. For 
lunch, traditional Irish fare is offered alongside burgers and sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shamrock opened in August, 1992. The goal, said Christina Duggan, is to 
promote Irish culture (they sponsor a soccer team in the Hibernian league) and 
to provide a gathering place. "We get quite a mixture, actually," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lovely atmosphere, and I meet a lot of other people from Ireland," 
said Harry Jones, a Shamrock regular who emigrated from Dublin to Newport Beach 
a few years ago. "I just like Irish bars." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of customers -- who asked not to be named -- admitted they had 
switched their allegiance from the Harp, mostly because that bar had become too 
popular, particularly on weekends. But Duggan downplayed any competition 
between the two pubs, saying she thought that more Irish pubs was better for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock music plays over the speakers here, but softly enough to keep from 
overwhelming the conversation. Live Irish music is featured Sunday evenings and 
will be expanded to five nights a week in summer. There's a television as well, 
but it plays tapes of Irish soccer matches and other sporting and cultural 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in June, the Shamrock should be a hotbed of Irish soccer fans. The 
national team qualified for the World Cup, to be played in the United States 
this year, and all of Ireland's matches will be broadcast in the pub. 
</P>
<P>
 Last St. Patrick's Day, the Shamrock didn't even have its full liquor license 
yet (it opened with a beer and wine license), but still boasted a crowd that 
spilled out onto the street. Be ready to wait a bit longer for your pint if you 
go today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shamrock Bar and Grill, 2633 W. Coast Highway, Newport Beach. Open Monday 
through Friday 9 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday and Sunday 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 
631-5633.  
</P>

<P>
 From the Shamrock, the new kid on the block, it's just a mile or two to what 
may be the county's most-established Irish pub and restaurant. Muldoon's is a 
sedate Newport Center landmark, one that serves Irish beers and food in an 
atmosphere more upscale than the Shamrock or the Harp. 
</P>
<P>
 The cozy dining room may be among the most attractive in the county, in an Old 
World way. Dark woods predominate, with an open kitchen, high-backed booths and 
several tables clustered around a large fireplace. The room is particularly 
popular on overcast days, says manager Sharon Barklay. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who prefer can eat on a secluded patio, which is heated to allow for 
year-round dining. The menu includes such Irish favorites as stew, corned beef 
and cabbage and lamb with mint sauce, as well as steaks and other selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the dining room, the pub is woodsy and intimate, although brighter and 
cheerier. Unlike the dining room, however, the music tends to be pop (Sting the 
day I was there) rather than Irish traditional. Sporting events play silently 
on the TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Food can be ordered in the pub, with an option of smaller portions on several 
menu items. The crowd here is heavy with local business people, particularly 
during lunch and just after work. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's events include live traditional music from 10:30 a.m. until closing. 
Muldoon's is another favorite spot for St. Patrick's. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldoon's Irish Pub, 202 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. Opens Monday 
through Saturday at 11:30 a.m., Sunday at 10 a.m.; pub closes at 1:30 a.m. 
daily, dining room closes earlier. (714) 640-4110.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Silky Sullivan's is another combined pub and restaurant with an Irish theme. 
Although the physical detail is nearly as impressive as that found at 
Muldoon's, the general atmosphere is more boisterous, particularly in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent weeknight, the pub was packed; the music, played a little too 
loudly for easy conversation, was country and rock. Essentially, this is a 
sports bar with an Irish theme (and Guinness and Harp on tap). 
</P>
<P>
 The dining room menu ranges widely; the two specials one recent evening were 
corned beef and cabbage and Jamaican jerk chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Patrick's Day is so popular here they set up a tent in the parking lot to 
handle the overflow. An expanded Irish menu will be offered; live Irish music 
and rock will be featured, and there will be hats and T-shirts for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration continues through the weekend, with live rock in the evenings. 
The pub and restaurant will open at 10 a.m. today and Friday, one hour earlier 
than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Silky Sullivan's, 10201 Slater Ave., Fountain Valley. Open Monday through 
Friday 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 2 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Fountain Valley is the Blarney Stone, a friendly neighborhood tavern 
with lots of Irish overtones -- from the proverbs painted on the walls to the 
portrait of John F. Kennedy hung reverentially in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock and country dominate the live offerings Thursday through Sunday evenings, 
but the Irish Beggermen, a local traditional group, plays the first Saturday of 
each month, and will also be featured today from 2:30 p.m. to closing. The bar 
does not usually serve food but will offer corned beef today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blarney Stone, 11761 Edinger Ave., Fountain Valley. Open daily, 6 a.m. to 
2 a.m. (714) 775-9987.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighborhood joint with an Irish touch is O'Hara's Pub, just north of 
the traffic circle in the historic district of Orange. On one recent weeknight, 
the crowd was college-age and pool-playing, with blues songs and '60s rock 
getting a heavy workout on the jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara's offers a full kitchen, with burgers and other diner-type fare. 
</P>
<P>
 A bagpiper will be stopping by today, but that's it for the live music -- the 
bar is just too packed to accommodate a band, they say. Also offered for St. 
Paddy's Day: green hamburgers and "Irish nachos." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hara's Pub, 150 N. Glassell St., Orange. Open Monday through Saturday 11 
a.m. to 2 a.m. Closed Sunday. (714) 532-9264.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last, but certainly not least, there's the Harp, where the bartenders pull an 
expert pint of Guinness, and Irishness is celebrated daily. The live music 
schedule includes rock as well as traditional Irish music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harp Inn, 130 E. 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 646-8855. Open Monday through 
Thursday 4 p.m. to 2 a.m., Friday 2 p.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday and Sunday noon to 
2 a.m.

THE PLUNGE, WITHOUT THE GRUNGE; RICHARD THOMPSON COULD TEACH '90S BANDS A THING 
OR TWO ABOUT OBSESSION AND DREAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Mike Boehm covers pop music for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like just about every performer who comes out of a folk tradition, Richard 
Thompson knows the value of mixing it up on stage with varied shadings of light 
and dark, comic and tragic, silly and somber. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the critically lauded British folk rocker, who made his recording 
debut in 1968 with Fairport Convention, started doing things the '90s way, 
following the lead of bands such as Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails and Soundgarden, 
whose palette of moods spans the spectrum from wretchedness to misery?  
</P>
<P>
 As a far more vivid spinner of narrative than any of the above (actually, a 
7-year-old at show-and-tell is probably a more vivid spinner of narrative than 
most '90s bands), and a far more poetic plumber of bleakness, Thompson could 
wreak some serious depression on a concert crowd if he chose to hold back his 
comic Muse and unleash only his Furies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never done it," Thompson said over the phone recently from Boulder, 
Colo., where he was laying promotional groundwork for his new album, "Mirror 
Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the terrible feeling that the audience would really like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who will have a band with him when he plays at the Coach House on 
Friday, bases that assessment on experimentation at a few solo-acoustic shows 
last year, when he invited fans to write down song titles and picked them out 
at random. There were long stretches of the bleak stuff, Thompson said -- 
longer than he would have inflicted left to his own devices. "It's very 
worrying," he said with typical wry detachment. "I think there's a whole kind 
of Leonard Cohen drear beckoning." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's new album, a middling effort by his own lofty standards, offers an 
array of obsessive characters ranging from the comically addled misfits and 
cranks of the lighter numbers to the poignant or nearly unhinged protagonists 
of his dark dramas. There's the misanthropic burger flipper of "Fast Food," who 
spits such lines as "I'd rather feed pigs than humanity." Thompson says he drew 
on firsthand experience for that one: a long-ago job waiting tables in a cafe 
at the London Zoo. "I was struck by how nicely the animals used to eat their 
food and how disgusting the human beings were," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the album's most beautiful song, "Beeswing," a free-spirited daughter of 
the hippie era clings to an unsparing ideal of freedom and independence but 
pays a ruinous cost for it. 
</P>
<P>
 If Thompson keeps telling tales of the romantically obsessed or the criminally 
crazed, it's because those are the characters whose stories he finds most 
vivid. He says the attraction began when he was a youth raiding the bookshelves 
of his dad, a Scotland Yard detective. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a real crime buff, and he had shelves and shelves of books. Being home 
and being bored, I'd read whatever was on the bookshelf. I read a lot of 
criminology, a lot of Robert Burns and Walter Scott. There's a reason songs 
glorify criminals: They're a challenge to the repressive elements in society. 
They often are folk heroes, representing the working class standing up for 
themselves and overthrowing the establishment and making fun of it. Also, 
people on the edge (make good subjects) because they're a little insane and 
under extreme circumstances. It's a situation where people are more likely to 
reveal what's underneath." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his first-rank skills as a lyrical portrait painter and mood 
setter, Thompson is a passionate, idiosyncratic singer and an accomplished, 
even more idiosyncratic guitarist. His music is grounded in the troika of key 
influences he heard as a youngster: American roots rockers, traditional British 
folk music and jazz sources such as Duke Ellington and Django Reinhardt. Middle 
Eastern sources also began to enter the picture in the 1970s, when Thompson 
converted to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 His first band, Fairport Convention, based its first efforts on early American 
rock 'n' roll before moving on to its signature melding of rock with British 
folk (Thompson's current touring band includes former Fairport drummer Dave 
Mattacks, as well as bassist Danny Thompson -- no relation -- and 
multi-instrumentalist Pete Zorn). 
</P>
<P>
 "British music was something we'd listened to for a few years. We hung out in 
folk clubs where we'd hear a lot of bad music and sometimes some really 
inspired music. We used to play a wide range in early Fairport. At a certain 
point we realized we were never going to be classic imitators of American 
music. . . . If we were going to excel at anything, we decided we should 
concentrate on British music and give it some sort of contemporary value.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Liege and Lief' (1969) was the album where it went full-out. We were going 
to revert to a broader style palette (after that folk-rooted album), but we 
decided it was more heartfelt. As far as I was concerned, there was something 
that stirred when you sang the songs in that style." 
</P>
<P>
 For years now, it has been a truism of rock criticism that Thompson is one of 
pop's most underexposed figures given the magnitude of his talent. But he has 
begun to acquire trappings of recognition usually accorded only to rock 
legends.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the 25th anniversary of his recording debut with Fairport 
Convention, he was the subject of a three-CD retrospective, "Watching the 
Dark," and of a tribute album, "The World Is a Wonderful Place." The latter, on 
the small, folk-oriented Green Linnet label, featured low-profile performers 
such as Victoria Williams, Clive Gregson and Christine Collister.  
</P>
<P>
 The star power will be upped considerably this summer, when Thompson's label, 
Capitol Records, plans to release another tribute compilation of his songs, 
this one featuring such heavy-hitting fans as Bonnie Raitt, R.E.M. and David 
Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really pay that much attention to that kind of stuff," Thompson said. 
The boxed set "was a nice package and a good thing, I suppose, for whatever 
one's profile is. But I try and look forward musically, so anything like that 
is just like a distraction."

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: ETTA JAMES "MYSTERY LADY" PRIVATE MUSIC  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Etta James to record a straight-ahead jazz album saluting Billie Holiday 
may seem at first like Roseanne Arnold expressing herself through Shakespeare's 
sonnets. 
</P>
<P>
 James, after all, is the Rock And Roll Hall of Famer who built a career 
belting bawdy R & B rave-ups and powerhouse ballads. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday, on the other hand, excelled at turning exquisitely crafted pop gems 
by the likes of Irving Berlin and the Gershwins into romantic mini-mysteries 
whose real power often came from what was left unsaid.  
</P>
<P>
 James doesn't try to emulate Holiday's inimitable style. "You've Changed," for 
instance, is more resigned in James' hands than in Holiday's original, in which 
the singer sounded almost perplexed at a love that's waned. But when the mood 
is right, James taps her blues-soul roots, providing an emotional immediacy 
that's absent from too many technique-happy jazz singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Any doubts about whether she has a right to be called a jazz singer can be 
laid to rest by her masterful phrasing on Holiday's signature "Lover Man (Oh 
Where Can You Be)," and in a confident, behind-the-beat delivery that's perfect 
for the late-night blues of "Don't Explain." 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Cedar Walton's arrangements range from the simple -- solo guitar 
backing on "Lover Man" -- to more intricate charts utilizing the full 
seven-member combo, as in "(I'm Afraid) The Masquerade is Over." 
</P>
<P>
 Tackling the Billie Holiday songbook is a bold step for anyone, at any time. 
By waiting 40 years into her recording career to take this headlong plunge, 
James wisely made certain she was fully up to the challenge.  
</P>
<P>
 * Etta James performs tonight at 8 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $25. (714) 496-8930. RANDY LEWIS

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: SONIC YOUTH "DAYDREAM NATION" (1988) DGC  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sonic Youth's master opus is an ambitious, 70-minute album that thrusts the 
listener into a dream world as accessible as it is corrosive and haunting. This 
quartet from New York City hadn't always exhibited such a gift for bitingly 
original rock 'n' roll soundscapes.When it first kicked up its heels in the 
early '80s, it was known primarily as a bunch of noise disciples with a handful 
of limited ideas. But by the time this album hit the streets in '88, these 
rapidly maturing indy rockers had developed top-shelf songwriting skills to go 
with their predilection for instrumental dissonance. "Daydream's" opening song, 
"Teenage Riot," best exemplifies the yin-yang spirit of the album, beginning 
with a few spellbinding guitar figures and bassist Kim Gordon's hushed vocal, 
and suddenly exploding in a flurry of gloriously distorted instrumental racket 
and Thurston Moore's passionate, hook-laden singing. Subsequent songs move 
convincingly between punkish assault and an artier, more experimental approach 
("Total Trash" spirals into some darkly mesmerizing avant-rock grooves, and 
"Providence" is a non-song of sorts defined by a distant piano and some 
intriguing piped-in telephone chatter). Sonic Youth's most daring disc, this 
helped place the band among the alternative rock gods. JON MATSUMOTO

 On stage, George Lopez couches his message in good-natured wordplay and spices 
it with a bit of physical clowning, but in interviews he prefers to get right 
to the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "My style is attacking ignorance," Lopez said by phone from a hotel in Walnut 
Creek, near San Francisco. The kind of ignorance that particularly gets his 
attention concerns popular images of Latinos and Latino culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, now playing the Brea Improv, says he doesn't have to look far for 
inspiration. For instance, there's the fact that the TV show "Beverly Hills, 
90210" finally added a Latino character this season -- and promptly got someone 
pregnant. Then there's advertising. "The Keebler elves are now in the tortilla 
chip business, and they're wearing sombreros," Lopez noted, sounding 
exasperated. "We don't sleep under cactuses any more." 
</P>
<P>
 The dearth of Latinos in TV and movies is particularly troubling to Lopez, as 
is the kind of roles Latinos do get. The 31-year-old comic hopes to break into 
acting himself, but he isn't about to take the kind of jobs that typically come 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to kill anybody; I'm not going to sell drugs, I'm not going to 
wear a headband," Lopez said. And, he added, he has little patience for Latino 
actors who do take that kind of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any actor in 1994 that continues to take roles that reinforce negative 
stereotypes should get out of the business," he said. "The blacks had their 
Stepin Fetchits in the '50s, and we have that now. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad state of affairs when the Menendez brothers are the two most 
popular Latinos in the history of television." 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the recent shows showcasing Latino comedians, Lopez says they only 
serve to ghettoize the comics and keep them from reaching a mainstream 
audience. "They call it 'Comedy Compadres,' " Lopez said, referring to one 
show. "They may as well call it, 'Caution, Do Not Watch.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, Lopez now lives in Universal City 
with his wife of six months. When his schedule allows, he enjoys talking to 
schoolchildren about opportunities and self-esteem.  
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I do it, and I enjoy doing it, is because nobody did it for me," 
Lopez said.  
</P>
<P>
 The work is especially important now because the Latino community lacks 
"visible leadership" and role models, Lopez says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's political awakening came at age 26, he says, the product of an 
accumulation of incidents rather than a single event. Even now, with frequent 
television appearances (including a recent Showtime special) and a flourishing 
club career (his stand at the Brea Improv is a whopping three weeks), Lopez 
must face the daily humiliations of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I walk by a car, and I get too close to it, they close the door locks," 
Lopez said. In restaurants, he has been mistaken for a valet; when he flies 
first class, he says he is invariably asked for his ticket when he sits down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin Luther King had a dream," Lopez said. "My dream is to be able to go 
out in a red jacket without someone handing me the keys to their Chevy Blazer." 
</P>
<P>
 Who: George Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Tuesdays through Sundays, to April 3. Show times are Tuesday through 
Thursday at 8:30 p.m.; Friday at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; Saturday at 8 and 10:30

 "Will it be the place on this moonlit morn  
</P>
<P>
 Where a pilot will solo, an aviator is born  
</P>
<P>
 Sensing the delight of the first solo flight  
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the thrills, the untellable delight?"  
</P>
<P>
 -- From "Fullerton Airport," by Bill W. Griggs Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From crop-dusters to private commuter planes to surplus B-18s, the 80-acre 
Fullerton Municipal Airport has hosted a dizzying array of aircraft since 
barnstormers first used the site as a makeshift landing strip in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 But controversy has also been flying over the city-owned site, which 
officially opened in 1928 and is now hemmed in by residential and commercial 
development. Supporters such as aviator/poet Bill Griggs, a longtime owner of a 
flight training and rental facility there, say the airport is a vital economic 
asset to the county. Others, including city officials of neighboring Buena 
Park, have called it a safety risk, pointing to the more than 20 crashes at or 
near the facility since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere between lie the rest of us: residents who, if we even knew it 
existed in the first place, regard the airport as something of a local 
curiosity, a point of interest that, gosh darn it, we really ought to take the 
kids out to see.  
</P>
<P>
 Mark this Saturday on your calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the facility hosts Airport Day '94, a free, 
family-oriented tribute to aviation and its place in Orange County history. The 
event will include displays of vintage and modern aircraft, a parachute jump, 
an air show of radio-controlled aircraft, food and music; County Supervisor 
Gaddi H. Vasquez will unveil a plaque designating the field as an Orange County 
historical site. For a fee, visitors can take wing aboard private planes and 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Day events, held every other year since the mid-1970s, typically 
attract 10,000 to 12,000 visitors, most of them from the immediate area and 
almost all of them non-fliers, said airport director Roland Elder. With no 
screaming fighter planes or spectacular stunts, the event isn't nearly as 
flashy as the annual El Toro Air Show, admits Elder, but it's homier, and he'd 
like to see more families take advantage of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is that this is one day on which any citizen in the area can come 
out and see us up close, (and) just be a part of our experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Former military pilot George Normington got his first taste of flying at age 
11, piloting model airplanes near his home in San Diego. On Saturday, he and 
other members of the California Air Show Team will stage a half-hour show with 
radio-controlled aircraft that include vintage biplanes, jets, gliders and 
World War II fighters, most of them with wingspans of nine feet or more. 
Members will also host demonstrations throughout the day and answer questions 
about the hobby, which Normington said is more challenging than it looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Models are "harder to fly than a full-sized airplane because you're not 
physically up there in the plane to make decisions," he explained. "You have to 
learn to (mentally) put yourself up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who prefer larger aircraft won't be left out. According to volunteer Al 
Pregler, an open invitation has been issued to plane owners and collectors from 
all over the Southland, including members of the Experimental Aircraft Assn. 
and the War Bird Society. Although Pregler can't predict the turnout, he 
expects visitors may see anything from World War II reconnaissance planes to 
pre-1940 antiques. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more unique modern aircraft at the event will be a Polish-built 
Wilga, a large utility plane that Elder compares to a "flying grasshopper." At 
about 11:15 a.m., the red, white and blue Wilga will climb 7,500 feet to drop 
three members of the Freedom Parachute Team. The jumpers will hang around after 
to answer questions and give kids a close-up view of their chutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, visitors can also come within shouting distance of the 
Goodyear blimp, which will descend to 50 feet during a 3 p.m. flyby, said 
Elder. And those willing to plunk down $10 or $15 can take 20-minute rides in 
private planes piloted by members of the Fullerton Airport Pilots Assn. and the 
Fullerton chapter of The 99s, a women's pilot organization founded by Amelia 
Earhart. Helicopter rides will be available for a similar charge. Tickets go on 
sale at 10 a.m. for the flights, which will take place between 2 and 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he says he isn't expecting a rush of new flying students there, 
Griggs says he hopes Airport Day will at least spark an interest in flying 
among families, an interest that he says can be passed on from generation to 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flying is just a really unique experience," said Griggs, who has seen eight 
of his children and grandchildren take their first solo flight out of 
Fullerton. "It changes the whole aspect of what you do. . . . Those who fly 
just have a different view of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Airport Day '94. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, March 19, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Fullerton Municipal Airport, 4011 W. Commonwealth Ave., Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Exit the Santa Ana (5) Freeway at Magnolia Avenue. Go north on 
Magnolia, then left onto Commonwealth Avenue. Lot parking is available on 
Commonwealth, east of Dale Avenue and along Artesia Avenue, which runs behind 
the airport. Free shuttle service is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: Admission is free. Plane and helicopter rides are $10 for 
children, $15 for adults.

FESTIVALS & EVENTS; FULFILLING THEIR MISSION IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every March 19, or St. Joseph's Day, for 61 years, San Juan Capistrano 
patriarch Paul Arbisco has rung the mission bells upon spotting the first cliff 
swallow on its migration north from Goya, Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least the first swallow he sees in the mission that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that more of the birds return to other locations in the Capistrano 
Valley, or that just when they arrive is pretty hit-and-miss. When Arbisco, 
born in 1895, rings the bells, it signals the start of Swallows Day 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is what everybody except the ornithologists is waiting for anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swallows always return to the mission on Swallows Day," pointed out event 
organizer Brian McInerney. "So we rejoice. We rejoice especially this year 
because it falls on a Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration at the mission features continuous entertainment on three 
stages, including Aztec and Juaneno dancers and flamenco guitarist Michael 
Olson. Mission School children will perform Mexican dances; docents will lead 
free half-hour tours, and the local Indian Council will teach bread baking, 
basket making and beadwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can converse with "Living History" characters and have photos taken 
with the six-foot-tall costumed character known as Big Swallow. Migrating south 
from Hollywood for the day are Tony Dow and Jerry Mathers of "Leave It to 
Beaver" fame, and Ruth Buzzi of "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."  
</P>
<P>
 Raphael Rene will sing his father Leon's famous song, "When the Swallows Come 
Back to Capistrano."  
</P>
<P>
 "The song that made the swallows' return famous was written in 1939," 
McInerney noted. "Before the '40s, the mission was the largest structure in the 
downtown area, so that's where the birds primarily came. As the town grew, they 
found other places to nest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scouts have already been spotted as we wait for the official arrival," he 
added, thereby perpetuating another myth: a scout is any bird that arrives 
before March 19. 
</P>
<P>
 What: St. Joseph's Day/Swallows Day Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, March 19, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Mission San Juan Capistrano, Ortega Highway and Camino Capistrano, San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (5) Freeway to the Ortega Highway exit and 
head west. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: Adults, $4. Seniors, children 12 and under, $3. Children 3 and 
under, free. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 661-7117 or (714) 248-2049.

SURFING: SLATER SHAPING RUN AT WORLD TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelly Slater, surfing's Wunderkind who saw his 1993 chances for consecutive 
world tour championships slip from his fingers, is back in the hunt for a '94 
world crown with a March 6 victory at San Diego County's Seaside Reef in 
Cardiff, says Rockin' Fig. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater looked loose, strong, fast and unstoppable, said Fig, who, as an 
announcer for the U.S. Bud Tour, scopes out pro talent on a regular basis. Last 
year, a knee injury and Slater's busy schedule, which included his acting job 
on "Baywatch," were a lot to contend with, Fig said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were people who criticized the popular champion that he was cruising 
last year.  
</P>
<P>
 At Seaside Reef, Figgy said, Slater pulled a backside 360. He got a long ride 
when an outside wave continued to the inside section, and he scored some big 
maneuvers before blasting the shore break with an incredible backside 360. 
</P>
<P>
 This is good news for Slater watchers. Slater has now warmed up at two U.S. 
Bud Tour contests, in Santa Cruz (ninth place) and Seaside, and, with the tour 
scheduled for Huntington Beach from May 11 through 15, there's a chance we may 
see Slater in local waters to protect his current No. 1 Bud Tour rating. The 
Bud Tour is part of the World Qualifying Series.  
</P>
<P>
 I was talking to Slater on the stage after he won at Seaside , and he said 
that this year he's really amped and wants to sharpen his tour performances. He 
quit "Baywatch" this year , and he's really making a strong move with two early 
season performances right off the bat, before the world tour starts.  
</P>
<P>
 Second place at Seaside went to Rob Machado, the Bud Tour's defending 
champion, who lives in Cardiff. Third was Richie Collins of Newport Beach, 
Figgy noted. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes Richie No. 2 in the ratings, behind Slater. This could be Richie's 
year for the Bud Tour. He is still coming off a back injury, and hopefully it 
won't give him problems.  
</P>
<P>
 Ted Robinson of Manhattan Beach won Seaside's long-boarding contest. Figgy 
said that's two victories in a row for Robinson. But two Orange County long 
boarders, Josh Baxter and Jeff Krammer, both of San Clemente, were right 
behind, placing second and third, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen socializing at Seaside were top shapers Al Merrick, Rusty Preisendorfer 
and Gary Linden. 
</P>
<P>
 They were checking out their boys, guys like Machado who surf for Merrick, and 
Pat O'Connell and Jeff Deffenbaugh, who surf for Rusty.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig also said that the Assn. of Surfing Professionals' head judge, Renato 
Hinkel, had a stint on the judge's panel for the Seaside event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors: The Australian national team was in town during February and was 
hosted by Orange County surfing families, said Janice Aragon, executive 
director for the Huntington Beach-based National Scholastic Surfing Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 Benefit: Les Perry's surf-music radio program on KWIZ-FM (96.7) is sponsoring 
a Surf Jam '94 at 4 p.m. March 27 at the Lakewood Hop to benefit the show. 
Featured artists include the Chantays, who had the hit "Pipeline." Hal Jepsen 
surf films will also be shown. Admission $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Signings: Surfing pioneer Mike Doyle, who is out with a new book, "Morning 
Glass," will visit Hobie Sports in Dana Point on Saturday for a book signing 
from 9 to 11 a.m.

KIDS ON FILM: DESPITE WEIRD STUFF, 'GILBERT GRAPE' MAKES A CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" a young man whose strongest desire is "to be 
a good person" sees no escape from the small town where he is trapped caring 
for his obese mother and mentally impaired brother, until an equally gentle but 
eccentric young woman passes through. (Rated PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It takes some maturity to understand, or even be interested in, the deadening 
effects of long-term sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 It also takes a little media savvy to get all this film's nuances and symbols, 
such as cars that won't start and heights that are climbed.  
</P>
<P>
 So it's not surprising that kids' appreciation for this mostly adult, 
lump-in-the-throat drama increased in direct proportion to age. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just was weird. It's not the type of movie I usually see," said 9-year-old 
Heather Peirce, who much preferred "My Girl 2." Heather, who didn't understand 
the title, gave the movie three out of five stars. 
</P>
<P>
 But 16-year-old Ian Davies gave the movie a perfect five out of five stars and 
thought the title fitting. "They have concepts in the film that make you think 
what's eating at him. I think his whole life was bothering him. He was ashamed 
about his family. The girl helped him to see who his mom was and get more 
open."  
</P>
<P>
 Ian went with his two brothers, Carlos, 10, and Jimmy, 13. The brothers 
regularly see a variety of movies, and this one looked interesting to them -- 
although it's still playing in only a few theaters.  
</P>
<P>
 The offbeat family members alone were enough to intrigue some young viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, played unsmilingly by Johnny Depp, is one of five children of a 
father who committed suicide and a mother who consequently gained 350 pounds or 
so. He works in a mom-and-pop grocery store and is the main protector of his 
18-year-old, mentally impaired brother, Arnie. Arnie is a trial, a happy boy 
who can't stop climbing the town's water tower ("Some days you want him to 
live," Gilbert says, "some days you don't.") The mother is a town joke -- kids 
dare one another to peek in the window just to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy was particularly impressed by the scene in which Gilbert's mother leaves 
her house for the first time in seven years to rescue Arnie from jail, where he 
has been placed after the latest tower-climbing incident. "The people started 
looking at her like she was really strange and stuff. I thought the person in 
the movie was really brave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing this unusual family from the inside out had a simple message for 
Carlos: "You shouldn't judge people by the way they look." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy added: "They were just living their life. They were doing what everybody 
does with their life -- working, helping around the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather was also intrigued in the beginning, before it got too weird. "I just 
wanted to watch and see what happened to the family because I knew Gilbert had 
problems."

out of the theater before the end.

 "I thoroughly enjoyed the movie," said her mother, Bonnie, a third-grade 
teacher. "But I was uncomfortable with her in there toward the end." Rather 
than language or the few suggested scenes of adultery, Bonnie was concerned 
about the treatment of death. "I was thinking of what was going to happen and 
thought it might be a memory that wouldn't be good."

 The youngsters agreed the actors were universally splendid. But they singled 
out Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Arnie convincingly. Jimmy applauded 
DiCaprio's Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.

SPECIAL SCREENING: ALMODOVAR BINDS 'TIE ME UP!' TO QUIRKY LOVE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" was threatened with an X rating when it came out in 
1990, just another example of how misguidedly impulsive the coding system can 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Almodovar's movie (closing out UC Irvine's "Tragedy and Comedy" series 
Friday night) isn't nearly as cheeky and insinuating as his earlier films such 
as "Law of Desire" (1987) and "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" 
(1988), which look at human relationships (especially where sex is involved) in 
farcically adult ways. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Tie Me Up!" was the first to have the X hanging over it like the Sword of 
Damocles. Or, at least, the Sword of Censors. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, that badge of dishonor was pulled, and the movie opened in the 
States unrated. Even so, you have to wonder what the worry was about -- the 
ratings board must have taken the title seriously. There's kidnaping and 
bondage, but it's all fluff, a comedy of manners involving a few yards of good 
rope. 
</P>
<P>
 Almodovar turned to one of his veteran ensemble actors, Antonio Banderas (who 
also starred in "Law of Desire" and "Women on the Verge of a Nervous 
Breakdown"), for the guy who does the tying up and the tying down. He plays 
Ricky, a just-released mental patient obsessed with Marina (Victoria Abril), a 
soft-porn actress and former drug addict. 
</P>
<P>
 We can see that Ricky doesn't solve science equations on the side (his bulbs 
are low wattage), but women love his dreamy-crazy ways and brown velveteen 
eyes. His female doctor gives him a wad of cash just before he leaves, thanking 
him for "the moments of mad pleasure you gave me." 
</P>
<P>
 Banderas, a true softie of a leading man, responds to her with the sensitivity 
of an adolescent boy yearning for approval. That non-dangerous style is a 
constant throughout "Tie Me Up!," which helps to keep the picture's edges 
rather blunted. Still, after he abducts Marina, slaps her a few times, then 
keeps her a prisoner, a wave of nervousness sets in. If Almodovar wasn't so 
intent on eventually turning his story into a cuddly love opus, these early 
scenes could rate as misogynistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina may be a fool for falling for Ricky and his twisted devotion to her, 
but the Spanish director isn't equating desire with sadism or masochism. 
Neither is this a testament to male domination as a cultural power tool; 
Marina, despite her predicament, seems much more in control than the 
near-idiotic Ricky. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, probing those elements could have made "Tie Me Up!" more interesting 
and not just a glancingly fanciful picture about the ties that bind (literally 
and figuratively) when romance is involved. It's not a bad film, but mildly 
disappointing when you consider what Almodovar, who's been called the successor 
to Luis Bunuel (high praise), has done before. 
</P>
<P>
 But Almodovar's fans (which, I've found, tend more often to be female) will 
probably enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 An old girlfriend who lived in Spain for several years and was active in the 
women's movement once told me that Almodovar understands the feminine mind more 
than any other male director. She loved this movie.

 Three days after slipping into bankruptcy in December, the Rib Trader's lease 
in Dana Point was purchased and the site is being remodeled as the Sunset 
Grille & Bar. It is scheduled to open April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 New owner Steve Rosen has worked in restaurant management for 23 years, he 
said, most recently at the Almansor Court in Alhambra, a golf and banquet 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen is planning a splashy decor for the Sunset Grille: an aquarium of 
painted wood fish in the entry and a 5 1/2-foot wooden car in the dining room 
with alligator surfers as passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu is a mixed bag, held together loosely by a tropical theme. Appetizers 
include Cajun-style barbecue shrimp and New Zealand mussels. On the dinner menu 
are a fried chicken salad with jalapeno dressing, and grilled swordfish with 
papaya and mango salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch ($4.95 to $8.95) will be served Monday through Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 
2:30 p.m. Dinner entrees will be $9.95 to $14.95, served Monday through 
Saturday, 5 to 10 p.m. Sundays will offer brunch only, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

 Nostrum Mare Bistro and Bar is offering a history lesson with its St. 
Patrick's Day menu. The restaurant, in the Doubletree Hotel in Orange, reminds 
diners that Caesar once occupied Ireland, and has added a Mediterranean twist 
to its Irish feast. 
</P>
<P>
 The meal includes a Caesar salad and choice of entrees: corned beef and 
vegetables steamed in beer and served on fried potato cabbage, or a 
Moroccan-style Irish stew of lamb braised with prunes, garlic, honey, peppers 
and almonds, poured over fried couscous cake.  
</P>
<P>
 The menu is available for lunch or dinner today, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 10 
p.m. It's $14.95 per person, excluding tax and tip.

 The St. Patrick's Day celebration at Raffaello Ristorante will not see the 
restaurant breaking with its Italian fare. However, its five-course dinner will 
include many green items, restaurant representatives said, in honor of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 On the special menu is fettuccine verdi , pollo farcito (chicken breast 
stuffed with spinach, asparagus and goat cheese) and tiramisu St. Patrick 
(green cheese mousse with white chocolate and pistachio nuts). To finish, a 
glass of champagne.

A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a pity that most of Orange County's Chinese restaurants still emphasize a 
"Chinese American" cuisine clotted with vegetable oil, corn starch and 
sticky-sweet sauces. Even a place as resolutely Chinese as Golden Phoenix feels 
it has to give us sweet-and-sour pork and egg foo yung. Happily, there are also 
more authentic Chinese options at Golden Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 The urbane Taiwan-born owner, Stanley Wang, has followed the rules here, 
rounding up the usual strip-mall Chinoiserie for decor: Mandarin lanterns, a 
lacquer screen, a couple of brush paintings and those narrow, lollipop-red 
vinyl booths that groan when you sit at them. But for anyone inclined to look 
past a pu-pu platter, Wang's menu is like a breath of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress, which this unassuming Mandarin and Sichuan restaurant has called home 
for 14 years, is well away from Westminster's Little Saigon, the area we 
usually visit to experience authentic Asian cooking in Orange County. Even so, 
Wang keeps his menu filled with cold dishes, Mandarin-style dim sum, 
preparations made with preserved vegetables, steamed fish -- in short, the 
things many Chinese people go to a restaurant for. 
</P>
<P>
 Try one of the finely crafted cold dishes to start. Shredded tripe in hot 
sauce is the best tripe dish I've run across in some time: soft, firm and 
redolent of the perfumes exuded by ginger, garlic and chili. Even if you don't 
like the idea of tripe, give this a try. Wang's duck roasted in five-spice 
flavor is tender to the bone, with only the lightest hint of anise and aromatic 
spices. This cold platter is wonderful with an ice-cold Tsing Tao, the Chinese 
beer that Wang is likely to suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, you can wander off the beaten path with fried rice cakes, glutinous 
triangles of rice fried with shredded meat and vegetables. There are boiled 
dumplings with a thin, chewy skin, a soft pork filling and a spicy red sauce 
that can be too oily. Golden Phoenix's version of the fried dumplings, known as 
kuo-te , which you eat splashed with vinegar, isn't the juiciest in the world, 
but it does have plenty of flavor. And the outsides are crisp, the filling 
properly dense. 
</P>
<P>
 Pork dishes are all good bets. Those who like it hot can try the traditional 
Hunan-style twice-cooked pork, where the meat is boiled and then stir-fried 
with Napa cabbage, black mushroom and red pepper. A milder and heartier choice 
would be stewed pork meatball with Chinese cabbage, better known as "lion's 
head" on menus that translate literally from the Chinese. These are huge, 
super-dense meatballs, braised to a deep brown on the outside and less fatty 
than you'd get in an actual Shainghai restaurant, where a heavy marbling of fat 
is practically a religion, meatball-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 The spare ribs with spiced salt are basically pork chops dry-fried in a 
crunchy batter flavored with curry and five-spice. The chunks of pork are 
nearly boneless (be careful when you bite down, though -- they're not totally 
boneless). They come with spiced salt, though the dish is plenty salty without 
the addition.  
</P>
<P>
 And that's my one complaint with the cooking here. Many of the dishes show a 
senselessly heavy hand with salt -- and this in a restaurant where the menu 
brags about omitting MSG.  
</P>
<P>
 You'll find a good number of favorite Chinese dishes on this large menu in 
some form or another. There are dozens of shrimp and fish dishes, including moo 
shu shrimp, kung pao shrimp (very fiery), sea cucumber braised in brown sauce 
and whole steamed catfish.  
</P>
<P>
 On the poultry side of the menu, there's a tea-smoked duck, though Wang shrugs 
and concedes that his chef deep-fries it ("a little"). You can get a whole 
roast Peking duck (if you advance order) for $25. If you don't budget for 
anything that ambitious, try crispy chicken at $6.75 and ask them to sell you a 
couple of pancakes on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of vegetable dishes are quite good. The dry-braised string beans are 
crisp, mildly spicy and mingled with little blackened garlic cloves, tiny dried 
shrimp and nuggets of minced pork. Mix them with steaming white rice: an 
epiphany.  
</P>
<P>
 Salty sauteed spinach leaves come suspended in a pool of green nectar, missing 
greatness by an ounce or so (too much salt again). Eggplant in brown sauce is 
delicious, too, in spite of another oily sauce. But I'd steer clear of 
vegetarian combinations. The mixed vegetables, for instance, are blandness 
personified.  
</P>
<P>
 All of this is not to say that you can't order almond chicken, beef chop suey 
or chicken chow mein , because you can. I didn't and, after a visit or two to 
Golden Phoenix, you may not want to either. Once a fellow like Wang teaches you 
how to eat real Chinese food, chances are you'll never look back. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Phoenix is inexpensive to moderate. Luncheon specials, served from 
11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m, Monday through Friday, are $3.75 to $5.05. Cold dishes are 
$6.25. Main dishes are $4.25 to $25.

T. JEFFERSON PARKER: HANDS OF MEMORY WEAVE DAYS SPENT WITH HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives in Orange County. His 
column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who has lost someone near to them to death knows how difficult memory 
can become. Is it best to remember, or best to forget? Should I dwell in the 
past or march with blinders into the future? And what about her things, his 
things, our things? Should they be left, stored, given up, thrown out? Does 
that picture on the wall gladden my heart with memory or weight it down with 
remembrance? 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, if you're lucky, you'll have to ask these questions. 
</P>
<P>
 I was asking them directly, a few days ago, when I visited the grave of my 
wife, Cat, with her brother, Tom. It was her birthday, and we brought red and 
white gladioli, then made ourselves comfortable graveside, reminisced and gazed 
out over the gray Pacific. Towering dark clouds had mounted in the west, and 
the breeze coming off the water was cold. 
</P>
<P>
 We talked for a while about whether this day -- roughly two years since her 
passing -- was a blessing for all the years we had with her (34 for Tom; five 
for me) or a curse for all the years we will have without her. We agreed that 
it was a blessing because everyone dies, and because Cat -- an eternal optimist 
-- would have slapped us both silly for thinking otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Convincing ourselves that we should be in a good mood because this was, after 
all, a birthday, we told favorite stories about his sister and my wife, stories 
that ranged from Tom's and Cat's childhood days in Tanzania to Cat's and my 
less exotic but equally enjoyable days in Orange County, Colorado, Key West, 
New Orleans, Cayman, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The liquor of these memories warmed our insides. We laughed hard at times, as 
people under duress tend to do (visit your local tavern and hear the expulsion 
of stress in the barfly's roar). Between the funny stories there were serious 
ones, revealing ones, touching ones. Tom's arms were covered with goose pimples 
from the wind. My stomach muscles shivered. We wished Cat a happy birthday, ran 
our hands over her grass and gravestone, then got back in Tom's car and turned 
up the heater full blast. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back to Laguna, we talked instead about home stereo speakers. We 
could only take so much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 That night Tom's band, the Bytes, played a gig at the Sandpiper in Laguna, the 
nightclub in which I'd first admired the band and especially the band's lead 
singer (Cat) a decade and a half ago. On a scorching September day in 1988, we 
had our wedding reception there, and Cat, wearing a pale blue dress and backed 
by excellent musicians, sang for me a special song -- "Since I Found You." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandpiper has changed little since then, little in fact for the last 
40-odd years. It was like walking into a picture from my wedding photo album, 
except the girl singing on stage was named Donna, not Cat, and an endless river 
of memories visible only to Tom and me raged directly through the dance floor, 
out onto Coast Highway, across the continent and into the night beyond. I 
caught him looking at that river when he sang "Tupelo Honey." 
</P>
<P>
 As I sat there in the 'Piper, looking at the strenuous comedy of white guys 
with no rhythm trying to dance, it was easy to see myself there with Cat, and 
numerous family and friends, on that sweltering afternoon half a decade ago. It 
was too easy, in fact. I headed home. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, in the quaint Baja village of Puerto Nuevo, three friends 
and I were walking around shopping for curios, choosing a restaurant for lunch, 
enjoying the passage of time. We walked past one of the older restaurants 
there, a two-story affair called Josefina Y el Negro, where, of course, Cat and 
I had dined some years back. For just a moment, as I studied the menu board 
outside, we were back in that upstairs room on a spring night, the only 
customers, toasting with complimentary shots of tequila gold and settling into 
what was to become one of the finest evenings of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't an evening you'd read about in a book or see in a movie, just two 
lovers alone in a small restaurant on a rocky coast, watching the slow 
nocturnal motions of a village, later driving through the pitted street with 
Clapton's "Holy Mother" playing on the deck. Behind every great evening is a 
song. That was it. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy to remember, all of it, standing there looking at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, a bizarre image burst from the front door of the restaurant. He 
was tall and slender, dressed like a foppish cowboy, with his tight jeans 
tucked into his boots, a rakish bandanna around his neck and beneath his thick 
mustaches a smile made for the art of the hustle. He looked like Zorro on a 
Methedrine jag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can get you in here!" he screamed to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a better place down the street," said a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for that fond memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, we set off a big skyrocket that spiraled out over the sea, zipped 
beneath the surface and exploded in a muted, subaqueous flash. I could not 
remember having seen such a thing happen before and I enjoyed it immensely. It 
had nothing to do with memory. It was fresh and alive and new. 
</P>
<P>
 Still later that night, we decided to go to the store and buy another one to 
see if we could make it happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Explosion or no explosion?" asked the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Explosion," we agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't happen again. This one tailed up and rose high into the sky 
before its boom rocked the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 I figured we were meant for the submarine treat just that once, and that once 
was going to have to be good enough. I warned my friends about the possessive 
fingers of the past, but we were all drunk by then, and I think they believed I 
was talking about getting our fingers blown off. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as well. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes; you look at the things he or she left behind, you rearrange 
them, you give some away, throw some away, move others to places of greater 
prominence, change your mind and move them back, wanting only to achieve that 
delicate and unknowable balance between the living and the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The world is full of places that were special to them, and they remain special 
to you. 
</P>
<P>
 "The souls of the dead are only free when someone alive recalls them to memory 
and thinks of them," my mother once wrote, in a short story for my father. 
</P>
<P>
 Then go forth, my dear ones. Or come back, if you will. You are not forgotten. 
You are free.

NIT ROUNDUP; NOT IN TOP 64? GEORGIA TECH NOT EVEN NO. 65

<P>
 Spurned by the NCAA, Georgia Tech was shocked in the National Invitation 
Tournament on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellow Jackets of the Atlantic Coast Conference were overwhelmed down the 
stretch by Siena, losing, 76-68, in the first round of the NIT at Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of comments by (Georgia Tech) Coach (Bobby) Cremins," Siena 
Coach Mike Deane said. "He was worried about getting his team ready because of 
the disappointment of the NCAAs." 
</P>

FRESNO STATE ENDS USC'S SEASON, 79-76; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CARL RAY HARRIS 
SCORES 30 POINTS TO LEAD BULLDOGS IN FIRST ROUND OF NIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing in front of a Selland Arena crowd of 9,219 and a national ESPN 
audience, USC's four-game winning streak came to an end Wednesday night with a 
79-76 defeat to Fresno State in the first round of the National Invitation 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In a battle of two guards named Harris down the stretch, Fresno State's Carl 
Ray Harris proved to have more firepower with a game-high 30 points as the 
Bulldogs overcame two late three-point baskets by USC's Burt Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which had won five of its last six games, ends the season at 16-12. 
Fresno State (20-10) will play the winner of Brigham Young and Arizona State in 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans led, 73-71, with three minutes remaining but were unable to keep 
pace as Mark Boyd and Stais Boseman missed key attempts, while Carl Ray Harris 
made the plays for Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it was an unbelievable basketball game," USC Coach George Raveling 
said. "The key to the game was Fresno State was able to make the plays at the 
end of the game a lot better than we did." 
</P>
<P>
 The difference was Carl Ray Harris, who scored six points and added a 
clinching assist in the final 2:33. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris tied the score, 73-73, with jump shot, then gave the Bulldogs the lead 
with 1:33 to play when he made two free throws, before making a difficult 
jumper over Boseman to give Fresno State a 77-73 lead with 16.3 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 USC responded with a three-point basket by Burt Harris with 11.2 seconds left, 
but Carl Ray Harris answered by passing to a wide-open Lee Mayberry for a dunk 
seven seconds later. Burt Harris' desperation shot was short just before the 
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl Ray Harris is obviously a big-time player," Raveling said. "You could 
tell by his performance tonight. You can always tell a big-time player by the 
way they take the shots at the end of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the season, home attendance has been a problem for Fresno State, 
but that was not an issue Wednesday. Especially with USC, the dreaded Pacific 
10 Conference school Bulldog fans love to hate, in town. 
</P>
<P>
 With every chance they had, Fresno State fans reminded anyone wearing USC's 
cardinal and gold of the Bulldogs' football victory over the Trojans in the 
Freedom Bowl two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the crowd, USC got off to a fast start with freshman Boseman in the 
starting lineup in place of Brandon Martin, who did not play because of a 
stress fracture in his right foot. Boseman's defense helped USC to a 41-40 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt Harris led USC with 20 points, three assists and three steals. Boyd added 
17 points and seven rebounds. Tremayne Anchrum had a career high nine assists 
and added seven rebounds.

WESTMONT RALLIES TO SURPRISE SALEM-TEIKYO, 75-71 
</P>

<P>
 Westmont College defeated third-seeded Salem-Teikyo of West Virginia, 75-71, 
on Wednesday in the first round of the NAIA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Warriors did not consider the victory a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was not an upset," said guard Zak DeMatteo, who made three three-point 
shots in the last 5:14 to help Westmont rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont (19-12) trailed by nine points with a little more than eight minutes 
to play when Coach John Moore called a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave them my Vince Lombardi speech," Moore joked. "No, really, I told them 
that if (Salem-Teikyo) won, it would be because we lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's an upset because we've been playing great basketball the 
past few games, and I think we proved it by beating the No. 5- (Azusa Pacific) 
and No. 4-ranked teams (Salem-Teikyo)." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Spears led all scorers with 18 points, including Westmont's first eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to establish the inside game first, so I was getting the ball more 
in the first half," Spears said. "That really opened things up for the threes 
later on. Those were clutch." 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont did not lead in the second half until DeMatteo's three-pointer gave 
the Warriors a 62-61 advantage with 3:33 left. His three-point basket with 5:14 
left had tied the score, 57-57. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMatteo had 12 points -- on four three-point baskets -- and Eric Simoni and 
Matt Gazaway each had 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont will play Life College of Georgia today in a second-round game. Life 
(24-9) was also unseeded. IAN

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pepperdine continued its recent domination of Cal State Fullerton, beating the 
Titans, 2-1, in a nonconference baseball game Wednesday at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eighth consecutive time that Pepperdine has beaten Fullerton. It 
was also the second time this season that the unranked Waves (12-10) have 
beaten the top-ranked Titans (18-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton leads the all-time series, 30-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine scored single runs in the first and third and Fullerton scored its 
only run in the second.

 The Titans had a chance in the ninth but failed to score. 
</P>
<P>

Giambi. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine then went to reliever Mauricio Estavil, who struck out pinch-hitter 
D.C. Olsen and Tony Miranda to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine had a chance to open a big lead in the first when the Waves loaded 
the bases with no out on a single, a walk and a hit batter. Fullerton starter 
Chad Rolish then hit No. 4 hitter Keven Dell'Amico to force in a run.  
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Bret Hemphill helped Rolish out by picking off David Rosato at third 
for the first out. Rolish got the next two batters to end the inning.

 The Titans scored in the second when Millan doubled to open the inning. He 
came home on a two-out error by Pepperdine first baseman David Newhan. 
</P>

PREP TENNIS ROUNDUP; DANA HILLS CONTINUES EARLY RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dana Hills boys' tennis team hasn't won a Southern Section title in six 
years and hasn't reached the section finals in four years. But if the Dolphins' 
nonleague play is any indication, both streaks might be ending this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills improved its record to 7-0 with a 17 2/3-3 1/3 victory over Trabuco 
Hills Wednesday in Dana Point. The Dolphins won eight of nine doubles sets and 
seven of nine singles sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were going to be in a match," Trabuco Hills Coach Craig Orr said. 
"We saw who they had played and what they'd done against them. I told the kids 
that a boxer never prepares for a fight not expecting to get hit. I told them 
this is a 20-round bout." 
</P>
<P>
 The bout ended early for Trabuco Hills (2-4), which fell behind by 11 points 
before it could win a set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a little closer," Dana Hills Coach John Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens also thought his team would have at least one loss by now, 
considering the strength of the schedule. But the Dolphins have beaten such 
powers as Corona del Mar, University and Newport Harbor, traditionally strong 
Sea View League teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like the opportunity was there for us to start out this well," 
Stephens said, "but with our schedule, the likelihood was shaky." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins' nonleague schedule doesn't get any easier. Next week, Dana Hills 
plays Punahou, the No.1-ranked team in Hawaii, and undefeated Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could beat those teams, that would be a tremendous start," Stephens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything is possible, especially if Stephens continues to get consistent 
singles play from No. 1 Erik Lunblad, who won two of three sets Wednesday and 
No. 2 Brandon Fallon, a freshman who won three sets Wednesday, including a 
victory over Trabuco Hills' No. 1 player Nolan Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins' doubles teams also have been strong. Mike Baxi and Justin Rimel 
and David Bailey and Christian Spaulding did not lose a set against Trabuco 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're solid from top to bottom," Orr said. "All nine players are capable of 
beating you." DAVE McKIBBEN

SKIING / WORLD CUP FINALS; SEIZINGER WINS; STREET SETTLES FOR FOURTH 
</P>

<P>
 The days of Picabo Street fights are apparently over. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's downhill at the World Cup Finals, the former bad-girl of the 
U.S. ski team was denied a top-three finish when Canada's Kate Pace bounced 
Street into fourth place with the day's second-fastest run. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Picabo might have started an international snowball fight. The new 
Street -- Olympic silver medalist and role model -- finds herself surrounded by 
children, not controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Staying off the podium all year is actually good for me," said Street, 22, of 
Sun Valley, Ida. "I have to pay more dues to be up on that podium. Once I get 
there, I'll be there for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Katja Seizinger won the final women's downhill and ran off with the 
World Cup downhill title. 
</P>
<P>
 Seizinger, selecting the 14th start bib, won with a time of 1 minute 47.08 
seconds on a course softened by temperatures in the 60s. Pace finished second, 
0.18 behind, and Switzerland's Vreni Schneider finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, the gate-specialist who once feared the speed events, now takes on 
all challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, what figured to be an exciting weeklong battle between 
Schneider and Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg for the women's overall title apparently 
ended when Wiberg crashed 45 seconds into her run and injured her ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiberg was taken to Vail Valley Medical Center for observation and released. 
It is not clear whether she will race again this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiberg entered the competition trailing Schneider by 41 points in the overall 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish she could ski," Schneider said. "I don't want the World Cup (overall), 
which is very close, to be decided by an injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Street, a close friend of Wiberg's, tried to comfort the Swedish star before 
she was taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's just scared," Street said. "But she's a tough girl. I think she 
wanted it too much, tried too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 With Wiberg's spill came some controversy. She was allowed to leave the start 
gate although there had been a temporary stop in the action to attend to 
France's Melanie Suchet, who had crashed near the finish. Suchet was not 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiberg, skiing 17th, after Suchet, was flagged off the course and ordered to 
restart. She ended up the last skier down and crashed on the run's technical 
portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Street skied tentatively through the same section, probably costing her her 
first World Cup top-three finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Street was happy to finish standing. This is not a career to be tampered with. 
Street has become a huge fan favorite, particularly with children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because I'm nice to them," she said. "I respect them and give them the 
time of day. I was a kid once, not too long ago." 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo Street fell short of the 400 points needed to qualify for today's 
women's super-G. . . . Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt finished 11th in 
Wednesday's downhill to maintain a comfortable lead over Luxembourg's Marc 
Girardelli in the men's overall standings. "It looks good," Aamodt said. "With 
normal skiing, I think I can hold it." . . . Switzerland's Franz Heinzer, the 
four-time World Cup downhill champion, raced his final downhill and finished 
12th. Heinzer announced his retirement at the Lillehammer Olympics, one day 
after popping out of his right binding only a few yards out of the start gate. 
. . . American gold medalist Diann Roffe-Steinrotter makes her final World Cup 
appearance in today's super-G. . . . Tommy Moe, looking to become a four-event 
skier, said he will ski in both the slalom and giant slalom this week. Moe is 
one of the favorites in today's super-G and trails Girardelli by only 47 points 
in the race for the World Cup title in the discipline.

TOMMY MOE TIES FOR THIRD, VOWS 'I'M HERE TO STAY' 
</P>

<P>
 Tommy Moe continued a downhill fight against the temptations of success when 
he finished tied for third in Wednesday's downhill at the World Cup Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third consecutive top-three finish for Moe after he placed 55th and 
20th at Aspen in the first two races after his Olympic downhill victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-Lillehammer letdown prompted suggestions Moe had perhaps put his 
career on cruise control. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moe, 24, vowed Wednesday, "I'm here to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland's William Besse won the final World Cup downhill on the Vail 
course with a time of 1 minute 38.17 seconds, 0.17 seconds faster than 
runner-up Hannes Trinkl of Austria. Moe and Austria's Patrick Ortlieb shared 
third with identical times of 1.38.66. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli, with his seventh-place finish, held off a 
charging Trinkl to win the World Cup downhill title by 20 points. Moe, from 
Girdwood, Alaska, is so committed to not being considered a fluke that he has 
declined all endorsement offers since winning Olympic gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspen set him straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was almost kind of embarrassed the way I skied," Moe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Aspen, Moe has placed third in two downhills and won his first-ever 
World Cup, a super-G at Whistler, Canada. CHRIS DUFRESNE

TENNIS; 'AVERAGE' SAMPRAS BETTER THAN KORDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An average performance by Pete Sampras was too good for Petr Korda. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, the top-ranked defending champion, finished two sets with aces to 
defeat Korda, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, on Wednesday in the quarterfinals of the Lipton 
Championships at Key Biscayne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a measure of Sampras' smooth and steady style that he won with little 
trouble, but failed to impress Korda, who lost a five-set final against Sampras 
last week at Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't play very good or very bad," Korda said. "He played average." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sampras of Korda's appraisal: "What does that mean about the way he 
played?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Sampras acknowledged that his serve was off, and that he allowed Korda to 
dictate the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play him, you want to keep the ball nice and deep, and hopefully 
he'll go for some low-percentage shots," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras' opponent in Friday's semifinals will be longtime rival Jim Courier, 
who defeated Goran Ivanisevic, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras leads Courier, 9-2, and won their most recent meeting in the 
semifinals at this year's Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to play a little bit better than I did today to win," 
Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
 In quarterfinal matches today, Andre Agassi plays Stefan Edberg and Jim Grabb 
faces Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's semifinals today will match top-ranked Steffi Graf against 
17-year-old Lindsay Davenport, a senior at Murrieta Valley High, and Natalia 
Zvereva against Brenda Schultz.

ALEMANY RINGS UP AN EARLY SIX AND HOLDS OFF CRESPI LATE, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alemany High scored all of its runs in a lengthy second inning, but the 
Indians had to hold on for a 6-5 victory over Crespi in a Mission League 
baseball opener Wednesday at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by six runs after 1 1/2 innings, the defending league champion Celts 
chipped away until they twice had the potential tying run on base in the final 
inning before failing to come up with the clutch hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a much improved team and they're tough," Crespi Coach Scott Muckey 
said. "I'm proud that we held them right there. That was good for us. I'll be 
glad if we play this tough all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany (6-1) started innocently enough when Rob Glenn grounded a single to 
center field to open the second. The junior catcher scored Alemany's first run 
on a fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Robbie Rehfeld hit a two-run single, second baseman Doug Segraves 
doubled home the fourth run and Monie Jensen capped the inning with a two-out, 
two-run double to right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did enough to get a victory but I'm not going to say we played real well," 
Alemany Coach Jim Ozella said. "It was nice, though, to get ahead of them and 
control the game the way we want to control it." 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Brad Farlow singled and scored Crespi's first run on a fielder's 
choice in the bottom of the second. The Celts (4-1-1) closed the gap with two 
runs in the third and two more in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi posed a threat in the seventh when Aaron Sabo led off with a single to 
left, but he was caught stealing second. Pinch-hitter Brett Niles walked, but 
third baseman Gus Jordt and first baseman Brad Wright flied out to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Farlow went three for three and Gonzalez went two for three with an RBI triple 
and a double.

THESE DUCKS MANAGE TO SKATE OLYMPIC RINGS AROUND THE KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Man from Maine remains unsigned, unsealed and undelivered after Canada's 
run to the silver medal in Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing changed on the Paul Kariya front Wednesday. There's still one Olympian 
at-large. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Mighty Ducks leaned on their other Olympians in a 5-2 victory over the 
Kings at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four former U.S. Olympians in the Ducks' fold -- Sean Hill 
(Albertville, 1992), Joe Sacco ('92), Tim Sweeney ('92) and John Lilley ('94). 
Each had an effect Wednesday, though Sweeney and Lilley seemed to stand out 
most of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney scored twice in the third period, although the second had to be 
reviewed by the video replay judge before it was allowed. Lilley created mayhem 
in his NHL debut. Sacco had a goal and an assist. And Hill assisted on 
Sweeney's first goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly, Sweeney has moved among the Ducks' scoring leaders with 14 goals and 
36 points, fourth-best on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wayne Gretzky slowed by the flu and a swarming Duck defense, Sweeney 
wrested the offensive spotlight away from the Great One's quest of Gordie 
Howe's NHL record of 801 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Sweeney did his best to upstage Gretzky. He knew it was impossible, even 
on a night when Gretzky went pointless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Wayne has about 950 goals more than I do," Sweeney said. "I'm just 
glad to pot a couple for us tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Lilley, on the other hand, made his NHL debut Wednesday and didn't let the 
moment pass without leaving his mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, that consisted of bumps and bruises to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was excellent," Coach Ron Wilson said of Lilley, who was signed as a free 
agent last Wednesday. "He's our version of Tony Granato. He brings an element 
we've lacked at times. He's a small, fast, aggressive guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a future here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lilley seemed unfazed, fitting right in with the Ducks' feisty, 
rough-and-tumble play. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jack Ferreira got a look at Lilley during the Lillehammer 
Games, and although the U.S. finished a dismal eighth, liked Lilley's game. 
</P>
<P>
 So did Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he played great," Sweeney said. "He had some nice hits. He showed 
he's not afraid to get physical. He's a spunky player out there. He gave us a 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, he's from Massachusetts." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney played at Boston College; Lilley at Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys really welcomed me," Lilley said. "Bob Corkum, my linemate, was 
helpful, telling me where to be on the offense and the coaches ran through the 
system with me." 
</P>
<P>
 He had two games with the San Diego of the International Hockey League as warm 
up, then jumped right into the mix, looking as if he belonged. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to figure when you look at Wednesday's game, but Lilley had few takers 
during the Olympics. He spent the week after the Games at home, waiting for the 
phone to ring. 
</P>
<P>
 It did and Lilley quickly decided he liked the idea of joining the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to sign with any NHL team," he said. "I was just waiting (at 
home). Anaheim seemed like the best opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 He gave the Ducks just push they needed in order to beat the Kings for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the wait for Kariya continues, made easier by the Olympians already 
dressed in purple and teal.

 Montclair Prep made 12 errors, kicking its way to a 19-6 loss to Moorpark in a 
nonleague baseball game Wednesday at the Mission Hills Little League field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Musketeers (2-1) scored 12 unearned runs. Their offensive leaders were

scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade 11, Harvard-Westlake 3 -- Casey Cote hit two home runs and drove in

<P>
 Shorstop Al Miller led Quartz Hill with two doubles and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hesperia 6, Highland 5 -- Reliever Ruben Escobar retired Denver Martinez on a 
game-ending bases-loaded grounder to second in the nonleague game at Hesperia. 
Highland (1-3) had rallied for three runs in the inning. Martinez was two for 
four and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas 16, St. Bonaventure 8 -- The Coyotes won a mistake-plagued nonleague 
game that featured 14 errors and 22 walks at St. Bonaventure (3-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Each team committed seven errors and Seraph pitchers issued 18 walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Kaufman (2-0) earned the victory for Calabasas (5-0). First baseman

CITY HALL JOURNAL: CERRITOS; CITY PUZZLED BY HOTEL'S FAILURE TO TURN A PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 203-room Sheraton Cerritos, which opened in April, 1990, was conceived as 
a cornerstone of the upscale Towne Center redevelopment project at 183rd Street 
and Bloomfield Avenue. The hotel was considered so crucial to the 
office-commercial development that the city agreed to chip in $750,000 a year 
until the hotel turned a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hotel's continued losses and the developer's failure to pay property 
taxes have raised eyebrows at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they are concerned that the $25-million hotel continues to 
lose money even though its occupancy rate last year reportedly approached 80%, 
well above the regional average. Officials also say they're perplexed by the 
failure of the hotel developer, Transpacific Development Co. of Torrance, to 
pay $900,000 in property taxes on the site for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That seems absurd," Mayor John F. Crawley said last week. "I can't believe 
they're strapped for money." 
</P>
<P>
 The delinquent taxes have prompted city officials to withhold $1.5 million in 
subsidy payments to the hotel the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Irish, chief operating officer of Transpacific, acknowledged that the 
hotel has enjoyed a higher occupancy rate than most of its competitors, but 
said the hotel's overall performance "has not been such that it's allowed us to 
make our property tax payments." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheraton officials completed an audit of the hotel late last year, and last 
month hired a new general manager, Hans Altenhoff, a food service specialist 
who is expected to enhance the hotel's banquet and catering operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food services was an area they needed to work on," City Manager Art Gallucci 
said. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 After the management change, city officials last week agreed to use some of 
the frozen subsidy payments to cover the hotel's $900,000 tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Transpacific, which holds the right to develop 60 acres in Towne 
Center, agreed to relinquish control of six acres of vacant land the city can 
now add to an adjacent retail development already under construction. GREG

CITY HALL JOURNAL: ARTESIA; CITY HALL NUMBER ON CAMPAIGN FLYER ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two City Council candidates are complaining about a campaign flyer, 
distributed by the mayor and another incumbent, that lists the City Hall phone 
number to call for additional information. 
</P>
<P>
 Challengers Tim Kelemen and John Lyon said that by listing the City Hall phone 
number, Mayor James A. Van Horn Jr. and Councilwoman Mary Alyce Soares have 
essentially required city workers to handle campaign calls."I'm paying for (the 
mayor's) secretaries to answer his phones for his reelection," Kelemen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents say the charges are simply a campaign maneuver by desperate 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horn and Soares, whose seats are on the April 12 ballot, recently 
distributed flyers listing their political accomplishments over the past four 
years. The flyer invites residents to "call us with any questions," and lists 
the City Hall phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Soares said the phone number was offered so citizens could find out more about 
the programs described on the flyer. Van Horn said suggestions of impropriety 
"just show the other side is losing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Ray, a city secretary, said she had received two flyer-related 
telephone calls and had received one check made out to Van Horn's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelemen acknowledged the $10 check was delivered by one of his supporters. Van 
Horn said it was the first campaign contribution he has ever received at City 
Hall, and added that if the check is indeed from a Kelemen supporter, "It'll be 
in two pieces." GREG MILLER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: BELL GARDENS; EX-CITY CLERK FILES SUIT ALLEGING 
DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former City Clerk Martha Ochoa has filed a lawsuit against the city and Mayor 
Frank Duran alleging sex, race and age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa served as clerk from April, 1992, until she was dismissed from the 
$48,000-a-year position by the City Council in May.She received three months 
severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa was the second city clerk to be fired in 13 months, and one of several 
top administrators to lose their jobs during the tumultuous months after the 
historic 1991 recall of four City Council members and subsequent election of 
recall movement leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint filed March 3 in Superior Court states that Duran fostered 
"demoralizing and derogatory treatment of women and people of color" at City 
Hall and that he verbally abused and intimidated female and minority employees. 
The complaint further alleges that Ochoa was fired after refusing to perform an 
unspecified "task which was illegal and unethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa was dismissed because her work was "not up to par. The charges have no 
merit," Duran said. "I've never been anything other than respectful to the 
lady. . . . I never said anything to the lady that would cause her to do 
anything but a better job." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Michael Estrada would not comment on the pending litigation, but 
City Manager Charles Gomez called Ochoa's charges bizarre. He pointed out that 
Ochoa, a Mexican American, is charging Duran, who is also Latino, with racism.

SCHOOL STAFF DEFIES BOARD ON FINANCES; EDUCATION: DESPITE VOTE REJECTING 
REPORT, ADMINISTRATORS TELL THE COUNTY THE ABC DISTRICT MAY GO BROKE WITHOUT 
BUDGET CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL and HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ABC school district administrators have reported to the county that the school 
system may become insolvent within three years unless the school board approves 
a multimillion-dollar budget-cutting plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators submitted their report in apparent defiance of the school board 
majority, which argued that the ABC Unified School District is in good 
financial shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the district had until today to submit to the county 
education office a three-year projection of the school system's financial 
condition. The school board met for six hours Tuesday in an effort to agree on 
what the report would say. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the end of a sometimes contentious meeting, board members and 
administrators could reach no consensus on the financial health of the school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators argued repeatedly that the district must report to the 
county that the school system might become bankrupt within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board majority disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 4 to 3 not to approve the report. Board President Cecy Groom 
and other board members argued that the district's financial picture is not as 
gloomy as it was portrayed by the staff. The skepticism of Groom and other 
board members frustrated Assistant Supt. Patricia Reid Koch, who is in charge 
of business services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is distressing to me that we continue to hear that the numbers we present 
cannot be trusted," Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district needs to cut about $2.5 million from the budget within the next 
two months to correct the school system's long-term financial problems, Koch 
said. She added that the district's financial problems have been exacerbated by 
a tentative contract agreement with teachers that is up for board approval 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract restores some earlier concessions imposed on teachers by the 
previous school board majority. That imposed contract helped spark an 11-day 
teachers strike last fall. During the strike, voters ousted Board President 
Catherine Grant, resulting in a new board majority that supported teachers' 
demands for a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Groom faulted senior staff members for not taking into account 
$1 million in cuts that the board ordered administrators to draw up for board 
approval within the next few weeks. The board members said the cuts should come 
from the administrative level. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators said they have not identified potential cuts yet and therefore 
could not report them to the county. Senior staff members said they would 
submit the report, as they wrote it, to the county with the notation that they 
were doing so without the sanction of the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Sally Morales Havice, David Montgomery and Howard Kwon sided 
with Groom. Board members Robert Hughlett, Jim Weisenberger and Dixie Primosch 
said they were in favor of approving the report.

SUIT SEEKS FEES FROM COUNTRY CLUB DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months after La Habra Heights voters rejected the expansive Powder Canyon 
Country Club development, city officials say they may be stuck with $85,000 in 
unpaid developers fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has filed a lawsuit in Superior Court contending that the 
Torrance-based developer, Forum Country Clubs of California, has failed to pay 
the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Colantuono, assistant city attorney, said the city also is likely to 
seek an additional $15,000 for the cost of putting the development proposal on 
the ballot in November. Voters rejected the plan by a 2-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had sought to build a golf course and 150 luxury homes on 540 
acres in one of the city's most secluded canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 The $85,000 represents the unpaid portion of a $145,000 contract signed by the 
city and the developer in August, 1992, Colantuono said. The contract was drawn 
up midway through the application process after city officials realized that 
the $20,000 application fee initially assessed would cover just a fraction of 
their costs to hire engineers, planners and attorneys to evaluate the plan and 
various revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the expenses eventually reached $400,000, and the city 
absorbed the costs not covered in the contract with the developer, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they have been unable to locate Forum's chief executive, 
Donald Miller. City Manager Noelia F. Chapa said she has tried unsuccessfully 
to phone Miller at least 10 times at his Torrance office in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts by The Times to reach Miller were also unsuccessful. A woman who 
answered the telephone at Miller's former number Tuesday offered to take a 
message but declined to identify herself or answer questions about Miller's 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Newbre said he last spoke with Miller on the phone about a 
month ago, when the developer had just returned from a trip to Asia, where he 
apparently met with Japanese investors in the Powder Canyon project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called him to see what the status was, trying to lean on him to pay the 
$85,000 he owes the city," Newbre said. "He said that he had been to Asia and 
discussed the matter with his partners and advised them that they would owe the 
money. He did not have a response from them on what they were going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Costs mushroomed beyond the city's expectations when the plan was revised 
numerous times in response to criticism. Each revision had to be reviewed by 
city consultants, Colantuono said. Further, as the controversy surrounding the 
project grew, the city had to pay consultants to attend additional public 
meetings on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The developer kept changing the description of the project in response to 
community opposition," Colantuono said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argued that the development would undermine the rural charm of La 
Habra Heights, a six-square-mile city of 6,000 residents. Others contended that 
the development would destroy fragile plant and animal life in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the city adopted new rules designed to protect itself from fee 
disputes by requiring developers to cover anticipated processing costs with a 
deposit. The new rules were put in place while the Powder Canyon development 
was still being considered, Colantuono said, but couldn't be retroactively 
imposed on Forum Country Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Hathaway-Francis, who opposed the project, said the unpaid 
developer fees would be a significant blow to the city, which operates on a 
$3-million annual budget.

SOMETHING TO DANCE ABOUT; CHOREOGRAPHER GIVES HOPE TO KIDS WITH CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A dozen children with cancer or chronic illnesses -- some bald from 
treatments, one whose leg has been amputated -- were tap-dancing, drawing, 
singing and trying on costumes sparkling with glitter and sequins on a recent 
afternoon at Long Beach Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Music from "Mary Poppins" and "The Little Mermaid" blared so loudly from the 
stereo that it was nearly impossible for nurses to figure out whose IV alarm 
was sounding. 
</P>
<P>
 The children in the playroom of the hospital's pediatric oncology and 
hematology ward could forget for a while that their lives have been  
</P>
<P>
 taken over by medicines that make them sick and tubes that follow them like 
puppies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they put their costumes on, they're no longer sick children," said 
choreographer Marilyn Clements, who teaches the children to dance. "They're in 
a magical place." 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, children who feel well enough can come to the room and spend a 
couple of hours with volunteer artists and entertainers, thanks to The 
Discovery Arts Center Outreach Program. Clements started the program last fall 
at the hospital's Jonathan Jaques Children's Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are art-starved," Clements said. "They're not able to take 
lessons. Their schedules are built around their next treatment, their next 
doctor's appointment, whether or not they feel well that day." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few weeks, Clements plans to bring a children's songwriter and a 
vocalist to the playroom. Don Harper, music director of Sesame Street Live, has 
already spent a couple of afternoons giving the children music lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ramesh Patel, who works in the ward, said he has seen "dramatic changes" 
in the children who participate in the arts program. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they go to the playroom, put on the shoes and start tap-dancing, they're 
able to forget the hospital and the chemotherapy and its side effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Moffett, 7, who has kidney cancer, is one of the program's regulars. 
She zips over to the rack of costumes and chooses a glittery get-up. Jennifer's 
face is painted, her smile bright, her enthusiasm for tap-dancing obvious in 
the way she hops onto the pretend stage, a piece of board. Her IV stand becomes 
a dance partner as the Calypso beat of "Under the Sea" blares from the stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 JoAnn Young, who has lost one of her legs in a battle with bone cancer, sits 
before a separate board and joins in, her foot furiously tapping shuffle-step, 
shuffle-toe-heel. It is her 14th birthday, and she is radiant in a new dress 
and black patent leather shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jennifer, she is all smiles as she dances. "I like the song that comes 
from the shoes," JoAnn says. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements, a Laguna Nigel resident who has been a choreographer 20 years, said 
she decided to start the program after doing a show at the hospital about 18 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do more, but I wasn't sure what I could do," she said. "I went 
for a month and just learned. I talked with them, sang, played music and drew.  
</P>
<P>
 "During those visits I could see the need in those children. They wanted 
normalcy in their lives. They wanted to express creativity. When one little 
girl said she wanted to dance, I knew I could offer something." 
</P>
<P>
 The parents, many of whom spend day and night in the ward, are grateful for 
Clements' efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives the kids something to do rather than sit in a room all day and be 
chained to a pole," said Suzanne Moffett, Jennifer's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jennifer underwent major lung surgery recently, Clements came to her room 
decked out in a red sequin dress, gold lame hat and several boas. 
</P>
<P>
 The prognosis for Jennifer? "We're counting on a miracle," said Suzanne 
Moffett. The cancer, which first was diagnosed when Jennifer was 3, has spread 
to her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements said more children are participating now, and more people in the 
industry say they want to donate their time. "Musicians, artists, actors, 
puppeteers -- they don't want to just perform, they want to interact," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Discovery Arts, funded entirely through donations, seems to be growing in 
reputation also. Recent publicity brought donations of shoes and costumes from 
as far away as Las Vegas and San Jose. But the program could use more, Clements 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program needs a cabinet to store costumes and shoes, as well as a video 
camera to tape performances. Clements hopes one day to have enough money from 
donations to buy art supplies and small electronic pianos for bedridden 
patients who want to practice.

BONDS TO PAY FOR NEW L.B. WATER PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is preparing to issue $38 million in bonds to finance a new water 
treatment facility that will replace a 45-year-old plant that officials say 
does not meet stringent health and seismic safety codes adopted in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1949, the city's water treatment plant at Redondo Avenue and Spring 
Street has ensured that Long Beach's ground water -- about 42% of its total 
supply -- is safe to drink.The water is pumped from 25 wells, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1997, new federal water standards will require several additional 
chemical tests and treatments that the current plant is not equipped to 
perform, said Dave Ferguson, assistant general manager of the Long Beach Water 
Department. In addition, he said, the current facility would have questionable 
reliability in the event of a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted last week to hire a law firm to assist with the bond 
issue. The bonds are scheduled to be sold in June and construction on the 
two-year project is scheduled to begin in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach raised its water rates about 25% in July to pay for various system 
improvements, higher rates for water imported from the Metropolitan Water 
District, and to cover the new plant. The average residential water bill 
increased from $18.90 to $23.90 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plant will help cut costs by reducing reliance on the MWD, which 
provides 58% of the city's water. Although the water will be subject to 
additional treatment, residents are not likely to notice any difference, 
Ferguson said. JOHN POPE

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; COMMUNITY PROTESTS OFFICER'S REASSIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neighborhood groups are protesting the reassignment of a popular police 
officer who was involved in a federally funded campaign against drugs and gangs 
in in an area of North Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders described Long Beach Police Officer Booker T. Heads III as a 
role model who reached out to area youngsters who are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week Heads was assigned to Operation Revitalization, an anti-crime 
effort by the district attorney's office, Police Department, probation office 
and school district. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (reassignment) is surely a setback," said E. Thomas Jennings, president 
of College Square, a neighborhood association. Jennings said Heads organized 
graffiti cleanups and talked to schoolchildren about staying away from drugs. 
</P>

 Jennings, a member of an advisory panel to Police Chief William Ellis, has 
begun a petition drive with other community activists to demand that Heads be 
reinstated. Jennings brought his complaints before the City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Police Cmdr. Ray Jordan, who supervises the program, said Heads was 
reassigned because of personal conflicts among the program's staff. He would 
not elaborate, except to say the position should be filled within the month.

 Funded by a $518,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice, the project 
began in October to target a reported increase in shootings, gang activity,

STUDENTS CHECK OUT HOTEL CAREER DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dressed smartly in a maroon jacket with gold details, diminutive hotel doorman 
Ivan Felix gleefully demonstrated that he had already mastered the Hyatt touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun," the fifth-grader said of his half-hour stint as a doorman at the 
Hyatt Regency. "I open doors for taxis, cars . . . and you make lots of money!" 
With that, Ivan pulled a dollar bill from his pocket to show off his first tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan and 27 classmates from Woodlawn Elementary School in Bell took part last 
week in Hyatt's Career Day, during which youngsters learn what it is like to 
work at a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt Hotels and Resorts initiated Career Day a few years ago. The Hyatt 
Regency in Downtown Los Angeles has been an enthusiastic participant for the 
past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a learning day," said Chantal Mariotti, the hotel's director of human 
resources. "We want to get involved in education in the community. And the 
employees love it." 
</P>
<P>
 The program teaches about and encourages careers in the hotel industry, while 
stressing staying in school, Mariotti said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Woodlawn teacher Dolores Beltran, whose husband, Philip, works as a 
sous-chef at the hotel, the event provided a unique way to teach her students 
-- many of them immigrants who speak limited English -- how to contribute to 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon their arrival, Mariotti provided a brief orientation.  
</P>
<P>
 The students were then handed gold-bar name tags, which they could take home, 
and their pint-size uniforms -- replicas of the adult uniforms -- sewn by the 
hotel seamstress. Using a list of student names, Mariotti assigned each student 
in advance to an employee -- a cook, a desk clerk or even the general manager. 
Mariotti set a rule that tips collected by the junior employees must be pooled 
to pay for a pizza party later for all the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Student cooks Juan Ramon and Irayda Ileana learned another rule from executive 
sous-chef Sayed Moalemi: "In the kitchen, everyone has to have a uniform and a 
hat." Fitted with the tall chef hats, Juan and Irayda went to work dishing up 
food for a banquet. "Fifty-three plates!" said a smiling Juan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Martha Daysi and Raul Mercado helped room service waiter Rudy 
Borrayo collect trays left outside rooms by guests. Clad in short, light-green 
jackets, the three rode up the service elevator, stopping on each of the 20 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching Borrayo gather the first few trays, Raul was ready to give it a 
try. He sped out of the elevator and down the hall to a tray laden with plates, 
glasses and a carafe. But the tray's weight made him stop and beckon Martha. 
The two came down the hall holding the tray between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking for role models and what they see at home is such a limited 
vision," said hotel General Manager Jerry Simmons, a former professional 
football player who worked his way up the Hyatt hierarchy from his first job as 
a part-time steward. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons offered a generic career tip as he showed a student around his office: 
"We stress fun -- work should be fun -- and that you should love what you do."

SOUTH GATE; SELF-ESTEEM CATAPULTED BY ENGINEERING EXERCISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's amazing what you can do with Popsicle sticks and glue. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-graders at South Gate Junior High thought they were constructing model 
catapults for the second annual Catapult Design Competition, sponsored by the 
Associate Member Forum of the American Society of Civil Engineers. But they 
were building confidence and pride too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really great to design something of your own the way you want it," 
said Lorena Navar, 14, who said she was not sure what a civil engineer was when 
she entered the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before her all-girl team, the 5 Non-Blondes, surprised themselves by 
beating stereotypes -- and 17 other teams -- for first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're girls," Lorena said. "We thought the guys were going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The contest was developed as part of the forum's efforts to promote awareness 
of civil engineering as a career and to encourage students to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice as many students participated in the South Gate contest this year. The 
winners receive scientific calculators and all students will receive 
certificates, said Mark Serna, chairman of the community outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to provide role models for kids from economic backgrounds who may not 
have professionals around," Serna said. "We introduce (the students) to young 
engineers . . . so they can see that it's not as difficult as it may seem (to 
be an engineer). All you need is the education." 
</P>
<P>
 The 18 teams tinkered with their designs for a month before unveiling them for 
a contest of distance and accuracy. Models were held together with glue, twine 
and bungee cord. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 Non-Blondes was the first team to compete. A hushed crowd watched as the 
catapult's triangular basket spat a fluorescent-orange golf ball 22 1/2 feet 
across the campus quad. Next, the team members estimated their catapult's 
accuracy and placed a board where they hoped the ball would land. The catapult 
arm pulled back -- and thwack -- the ball solidly hit its mark. The crowd 
roared as if watching the home team slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers agreed that the outdoor competition helped students apply classroom 
lessons in a concrete way. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important lesson was about cooperation, students said. 
</P>
<P>
 Red-haired Erica Sanchez, 14, who said her hair color brought the 5 
Non-Blondes their luck, summed it up: "I love this team."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST AREA; CONSPIRACY TRIAL TO START FOR FATHER, SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former cable-TV host and his father will go to trial today in Norwalk 
Superior Court on charges they hired a hit man last year to kill a 14-year-old 
Pico Rivera girl whom the son was accused of raping. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito David Valdez Jr., 23, and his father, Tito David Valdez Sr., 56, both of 
Downey, are charged with conspiracy and solicitation to murder the girl.Tito 
Valdez Jr. was sentenced earlier this month to 14 years in prison after being 
convicted of rape and lewd conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his father are accused of hiring a contract killer in early December to 
stop the girl from testifying. They were arrested several hours later and no 
murder attempt was made. Both defendants are in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Tito Valdez Jr. hosted the "Hollywood Haze" program about the 
underground-party scene in the Southland. The show was aired last fall on 
Continental Cablevision, which serves several Southeast cities.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PARAMOUNT; FORMER SUPT. CALDWELL GRANTED NEW TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Paramount schools Supt. Richard Caldwell may get another chance in 
court to win back his job. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has granted Caldwell a new trial in his suit that 
contends Paramount Unified board members discriminated against him because of 
his age and race when they refused to renew his contract two years 
ago.Caldwell, 68, is white. 
</P>
<P>
 If the case goes to trial again, the only issue will be whether Caldwell lost 
his job because of his age, attorneys for both sides said. A jury ruled in 
January that the district did not discriminate against Caldwell because of his 
race, but deadlocked over the issue of age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Jerry K. Fields last week decided that he gave the jury erroneous 
instructions, according to Caldwell's attorney, Alex Molina. The judge has 
decided he erred in telling the jury that Caldwell had to prove he was 
performing satisfactorily to win the lawsuit, Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has appealed, according to its attorney, Conrad Kohrs. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell served as superintendent of the district for 13 years. In November, 
he won a seat on the board that had refused to renew his contract.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; GUIDED MISSILE DESTROYER TO BE COMMISSIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Navy's newest guided missile destroyer, the $800-million Curtis Wilbur, 
has arrived in Long Beach for commissioning ceremonies Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The warship will be the last vessel commissioned at the Long Beach Naval 
Station, which is scheduled to close Sept. 30 because of military cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship, which was built in Maine by Bath Iron Works, is equipped with the 
Aegis Combat System that allows its crew to track more than 200 sea and air 
targets while simultaneously engaging those targets with the ship's weapons. It 
is named after Curtis Wilbur, former Navy secretary and California Supreme 
Court justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy Secretary John H. Dalton will be the keynote speaker during commissioning 
ceremonies, which begin at 11 a.m. The ship's home port is San Diego.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; MYSTERIOUS CAT DEATHS RAISE POLICE CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four cats have been found dead in recent weeks in the canals in a two-block 
stretch of the Naples area, and other cats have been reported missing, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Police Cpl.Marcia Rhone, who has patrolled the Belmont Shore and 
Naples area for three years, said the deaths and disappearances seem to be more 
than coincidental. Many of the cats have disappeared on Friday nights, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A homeless man reported seeing a group of teen-agers put a cat into a bag and 
then throw it into the canal, Rhone said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Gonzales, senior animal control officer for the city, said his office was 
keeping an eye on the situation, but has no idea who might be responsible. He 
advises residents to keep their animals indoors, and all pets should have 
proper identification tags, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some strange people out there who do some strange things to animals," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willful cruelty to animals is a felony, Rhone said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; TWO FINALISTS FOR PRESIDENT OF CAL STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The field of candidates for president at Cal State Long Beach has been 
narrowed to two: Karl Anatol, interim president at the university since last 
March, and Robert Maxson, president of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be interviewed Wednesday by the California State University Board of 
Trustees, which is expected to name a new president next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatol has been at Cal State Long Beach since 1969, serving in many positions 
including university provost and vice president for academic affairs, dean of 
the School of Humanities, and acting dean of the School of Business 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson has been president of UNLV since 1984, guiding the university in 
unprecedented growth and overseeing an extensive expansion of the university's 
physical facilities. He revealed last month that he also was a candidate for 
president at the University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other semifinalists, Robert Detweiler and Manuel Ibanaz, withdrew from 
consideration before the two finalists were selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 80 people applied for the Cal State Long Beach position, which became 
vacant when Curtis McCray accepted the presidency of Millikin University in 
Illinois early last year.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST AREA; SCHOOL ACTIVISTS MAY SEEK SPLIT FROM LAUSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Education activists in the Southeast area, angered by a recommendation to 
create a "super cluster" of the three local high school complexes when the Los 
Angeles Unified School District reorganizes, say it may be time to secede. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those in the area that feel we should be our own school district," 
said Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell, Huntington Park and South Gate high school complexes, with a 
combined enrollment of about 55,000, would be the largest of 24 clusters under 
a plan recommended by a subcommittee of the Cluster Transition Task Force. The 
next-largest cluster, combining the Manual Arts and Jefferson high school 
complexes in Los Angeles, would have about 43,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The community clusters, which would regroup the district's 650 campuses into 
high schools and their feeder campuses, are the first step of a plan to 
restructure the district and decentralize decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it is unclear how the district's resources will be distributed to the 
clusters, some fear that the Southeast area, where at least 94% of high school 
students are Latino and 55% speak limited English, could be shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We better get more money than any other cluster," Escutia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Peyton, director of the district office of school utilization, said that 
if resources are distributed on a per-pupil basis, the resources would be the 
same as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
 Secession would not be easy, activists acknowledged. The Southeast area is the 
district's most overcrowded and would need to raise money for new buildings as 
well as compete with Los Angeles Unified for state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Escutia supports a plan proposed by the Latino Leadership Coalition for 
Education that would break Southeast schools into three clusters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huntington Park Principal Tony Garcia said many of his colleagues feel it 
is best to begin with a united Southeast cluster. "We stand a good chance of 
working together because we have worked together in the past," he said. If the 
"super cluster" failed, he said, the three high school complexes could become 
separate clusters later. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson is to send his recommendation on clusters to the school 
board in mid-April. The district hopes to implement the cluster proposal by 
July.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BELL; LIBRARY EXTENDS HOURS TO 3 DAYS PER WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bell Community Library will now be open Tuesdays, thanks to a deal between 
the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
 The library has been open just two days a week since state budget cuts forced 
the county government to cut library and other services last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The library in Bell is owned by the city but staffed by the county. Under the 
new agreement, the city will accept an extra day of county library services 
each week in exchange for rent, said City Administrator Robert A. Rizzo. 
</P>
<P>
 The county was paying $2,046 a month in rent and recently calculated the cost 
of operations at about $700 a day, Rizzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through June 21, the library hours are 1 to 8 p.m. Monday and Tuesday and 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursday.

COVER STORY; THE INVISIBLE FOE; URBAN ILLS COMBINE TO MAKE TUBERCULOSIS TOUGH 
TO BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judy was recovering from a car accident, but doctors couldn't figure out why 
she kept running a fever. Jennifer went to bed most nights feeling fine, then 
woke up with a hacking cough. Fernando was just weary all the time, and the 
rest of the family began feeling the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few years ago, many doctors might have prescribed lots of orange juice 
and rest, writing off this collection of symptoms as just another virus. 
</P>
<P>
 But after four years of drumbeating by the Long Beach Department of Health and 
Human Services, just about everybody -- from local physicians to the City 
Council; from social service agencies to homeless people camped out in city 
parks -- is finally becoming aware of an insidious, growing presence in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy, Jennifer and Fernando -- not their real names -- didn't have colds. Like 
hundreds of others in this city of 430,000, they had tuberculosis, the 
debilitating lung disease that has been afflicting humans since the Stone Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease, thought to have gone the way of polio and scarlet fever, is back 
in a big way in Long Beach and other urban areas. New TB cases in the city 
jumped more than 30% last year to 148, an eight-year peak, while the number of 
cases throughout Los Angeles County was dropping about 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the last year for which statewide records were available, Long Beach 
was fifth in new tuberculosis cases per capita among California cities, after 
San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles and Santa Ana. In that year, there were 
25.8 new cases for every 100,000 people in Long Beach, and last year the number 
jumped to 33.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Health authorities have watched with alarm the return of tuberculosis to Long 
Beach like a haunting specter from the past. In April, 1990, the City Council 
declared a local tuberculosis emergency, making the city eligible for special 
state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned that there might be a lot more cases unless we dealt with 
the disease aggressively," said Diana Bonta, director of the city's Department 
of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonta's department beefed up the city's tuberculosis clinic, sent city workers 
into the field to attack the disease at its sources and notified local 
physicians that they had to report new cases to the city. With help from the 
state and federal government grants, Long Beach is now pouring more than $1 
million a year into the prevention and cure of tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease came as a big shock to some of its victims. "I was absolutely 
dumbfounded when they told me," said one man, the son of a Midwest contractor. 
"I remember when there were TB sanatoriums. My father used to remodel them, 
turning them into college campuses." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as if tuberculosis were anything new. Scientists have found evidence 
of the disease in 4,000-year-old Egyptian mummies. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, tuberculosis patients were relegated to remote sanatoriums, 
often in mountain or desert locations, where afflicted lungs could presumably 
breathe cleaner air. The big medical breakthrough came with the discovery in 
1943 of streptomycin, the first drug to prove effective against the 
tuberculosis germ. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1960s, after even more effective drugs had been discovered, 
tuberculosis was in full retreat in America. In 1985, the United States 
recorded its lowest number of new tuberculosis cases, 22,201, since the Centers 
for Disease Control began to keep track in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
 But homelessness, immigration from foreign disease centers, grinding poverty 
and AIDS have primed urban America for the return of tuberculosis as a major 
public health problem, authorities say. The disease has been sweeping the 
country, increasing 20% from 1985 to 1992. The number of cases dropped about 5% 
last year, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers 
for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis follows a slow, unswerving course, traveling between drug users, 
AIDS patients, children and down-and-outers -- all with limited means to fight 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 It rarely affects perfectly healthy individuals who happen to come into 
contact with a carrier, doctors say. For instance, none of the city's 
tuberculosis clinic workers, who deal with infected patients every day, have 
tested positive for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an easy bug to catch," says Barbara Lindsay, a public health nurse 
who coordinates the tuberculosis program for the city. "It usually takes quite 
a lot of exposure to someone who's sick." 
</P>
<P>
 But if a patient fails to take his medicine, which can render him 
non-infectious within a couple of weeks, he can spread the germs to other 
vulnerable individuals. The disease travels on droplets of moisture from coughs 
or sneezes, or even from singing, in crowded, poorly ventilated rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis saps victims' energy and eats "holes" in their lungs, where 
protective cells called macrophages attack the germs, forming spongy clumps. In 
advanced cases, the germs move into blood vessels and attach themselves to 
bones, the brain or kidneys, causing blindness and skin lesions -- even sending 
victims into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the disease's victims were exposed years before the symptoms -- weight 
loss, night sweats, fever, fatigue and a stubborn cough -- ever appear, health 
authorities say. The rest are family members or others who live in close 
proximity to the infected. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the disease's physical effects, tuberculosis patients are often 
afflicted in other ways, Lindsay says. "There's a lot of fear now," she said, 
explaining why most patients ask that their names not be divulged. "There's all 
of this tuberculosis around, and people don't understand how you catch it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some patients who have been publicly identified have been evicted from 
apartments or fired because of the "stigma" of the disease, Lindsay said. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that, even in the worst of circumstances, tuberculosis is 
curable. An array of new drugs can knock out the germ, tubercle bacillus, even 
when the disease is advanced. As a result, Long Beach hasn't had a TB-related 
death in at least six years. 
</P>
<P>
 But curing the disease requires a fastidious dedication to the treatment, the 
kind of dedication that is rare among substance abusers or the economically 
deprived. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients must take the prescribed megadoses of pills, up to 22 of them at a 
time for periods of a year or more. Interrupt the treatment or stop taking the 
pills after a couple of months and the disease can come back with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patient starts feeling better, and he says, 'I don't need to do this for 
six months, I'm fine,' " said Bonta, the health and human services director.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite often dramatic improvements at the start of treatment, however, the 
bacterium still lurks in the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the tubercle bacillus get back on its feet and, like a boxer who has 
figured out how to elude his opponent's uppercut after getting nailed a few 
times, it can come back stronger than before, health workers say. And this time 
it will be resistant to the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 There's only one way to fight this disease, medical authorities say. 
Aggressively. Pound it into the ground. Attack it with three or four medicines 
-- isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide, sometimes all together -- 
and continue the therapy long after lungs heal and germs disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Matthew Locks of the city's tuberculosis clinic spreads three X-rays in a 
row on a table in his little examining room in the Health Department 
headquarters on Grand Avenue. They are successive pictures of the lungs of a 
75-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, there's a big hole here," says Locks, pointing at an X-ray taken 
last October. On the right lung there is a circular shadow the size of a 
50-cent piece. In the next X-ray, the shadow begins to be replaced with the 
milky white of healthy tissue, as the drugs begin to take effect. In the final 
one, taken less than four months after the disease had been identified, the 
shadow is almost gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The healthy tissue expands into the hole," said Locks, 75, the former county 
TB control director who has been treating the disease since the 1940s. "He's 
doing fine now. And so are his family members." 
</P>
<P>
 So the elderly patient is cured? Not by a long shot. "He still needs six or 
seven months of the drugs," Locks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach health workers take the same aggressive attitude in tracking down 
the infected and making sure they adhere to the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just a private health problem," Lindsay said. "It's a public 
health problem." 
</P>
<P>
 City health workers approach the health of the community as if it were a 
forest during a drought. Neglect all of the barbecue pits and campfires 
smoldering out there, let the wind spread their sparks, and the result can be a 
roaring conflagration consuming the trees, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Health and Human Services building on Grand Avenue is barely a year old, 
but already the first-floor tuberculosis clinic is outgrowing its space. Some 
days the waiting room overflows with patients, new and old, and the nurses pass 
out medicines like supermarket checkers dispensing groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 The place percolates with activity. A staff of five medical professionals, two 
community workers and a clerk examine patients, dig out information about 
others who could have been exposed and begin the challenging task of getting 
their commitment to cure the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 When a patient does not show up for an appointment, health workers such as 
Graciela Espinoza get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone doesn't come back, if they miss their appointments, the community 
worker gets on the phone to find out why," Lindsay said. "They're bulldogs." 
</P>
<P>
 If patients are persistently non-compliant, someone like Espinoza will go 
directly to their homes and watch them swallow their pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's where those smoldering fires all over town are kept under control. 
Espinoza travels through the city with a container of medicine, tracking down 
prostitutes and drug users in flophouse hotels, trying to reason with a 
schizophrenic here, offering advice to a transvestite AIDS patient there. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, 36, is a cheerful woman, but there is steel behind her wide smile 
and solicitous manner. Even the most resistant end up popping pills into their 
mouths under her steady gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 She finds Jimmy, an AIDS patient, asleep on the couch in a tiny house just 
west of Belmont Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza bends over the young man and searches his face. "You have some 
water?" she says, cupping his hand in her own and dropping pills into his palm. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of town, Brad sits in a wheelchair in a bare living room, 
watching a daytime talk show on television. His daughter, Brenda, talks 
bitterly about Brad's health and about his drinking buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a stroke because of all the pressure from his friends, and now he 
wants them to come and visit him," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had a drink in a month," he growls. "Not since I got out of the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza listens patiently and watches him take his medicine. Brad gives each 
pill a dubious examination, places it in his mouth and then, with excruciating 
slowness, chews it like a horse eating oats. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of reasons why patients fail to take their medicine, Espinoza 
said. Long Beach is increasingly a city of immigrants, and the city's 
tuberculosis patients reflect it. More than three-quarters of the city's 
tuberculosis victims are foreign born, many of them from Mexico, the 
Philippines and Cambodia, where TB rates are high. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception is, 'What's the big deal?' " Lindsay said. "They say that 
everyone they know has a positive reaction (to TB screening tests). Some even 
tell us they were born that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the foreign-born have more faith in folk remedies than in modern 
medicine, Espinoza said. "People from the ranchos (in Mexico) have their 
curanderos (healers)," she said. "Mostly they prescribe herbs. It's not enough 
to cure TB." 
</P>
<P>
 But some patients fail to take their medicine because they are on a course of 
self-destruction, inviting health problems. "We have a lot of alcoholics who, 
because of their drinking, don't pay too much attention to their health," 
Espinoza says. 
</P>
<P>
 When Espinoza loses a patient into the underground of Long Beach's rootless 
and impoverished, she brings in the health department's investigative services 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Kingsbury, one of the nine field investigators who tracks down patients 
with infectious diseases, steps in. An imposing Utah native with yard-wide 
shoulders, Kingsbury is a Health Department Joe Friday, following the lukewarm 
trails of the homeless and transients into shelters, cheap hotels and city 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pieces of paper," he calls the missing patients. For each, there is an order 
sheet with information on the most recent sightings and, if Kingsbury is lucky, 
a Polaroid picture. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Kingsbury is looking for a man named Bruce, an itinerate follower 
of the rock band the Grateful Dead, who showed up at the Long Beach health 
department in January, asking for medicine after he lost his bus ticket to San 
Francisco. Kingsbury also is looking for Jorge, a recently released jail 
inmate. If he finds either, he'll whisk them back to the clinic for testing and 
a dose of medication. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody remembers seeing the Dead Head in the tie-dyed shirt, and Jorge 
hasn't made an appearance at the city's shelters or assistance centers yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigator is luckier in North Long Beach, finding members of a 
tuberculosis-afflicted immigrant Filipino family at home. The parents and two 
sons have submitted to the treatment, but two grown daughters, both of whom 
work full-time jobs, have failed to meet appointments at the clinic to be 
diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for them," the mother says. "They don't get time off during the 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kingsbury gets an assurance from her that the daughters will call him the 
following day and make arrangements to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could get a legal order against them," he says afterward, "but it goes 
against my grain. I think you can get a lot further if you show concern rather 
than threatening them." 
</P>
<P>
 In rare cases, the adamantly non-compliant are arrested and placed in a closed 
clinic in the county jail, where they are forced to accept treatment. "There 
was one ornery old man who was consistently recalcitrant," Kingsbury said. 
"Finally we said, 'Either take your medication or go to jail.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The man was eventually confined in the jail clinic for five months. It was 
only the second such case in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's ton-of-bricks approach to the disease may begin to pay off in a 
year or two, said Bonta. "We'll probably keep on at the present rate in '94," 
she said. "Then we might start going down." Tuberculosis Cases In Long Beach

 The Lynwood High girls' basketball team will be aiming for back-to-back 
championships when it meets undefeated Atherton Sacred Heart for the State 
Division I title at 6 p.m. Saturday at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood (32-1) reached the title game with a 62-51 win Saturday over Clovis 
West in the Southern Regional final. The Knights defeated San Francisco Balboa, 
65-51, in the championship game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacred Heart (37-0) defeated Cupertino Monte Vista, 63-37, in the Northern 
Regional final last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the two key ingredients in Lynwood's success have been senior forward 
Timicha Kirby and senior guard-forward Tawana Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11 Kirby played one of her best games of the season against Clovis 
West, scoring 29 points and grabbing nine rebounds. Grimes was held to eight 
points in the game, but had nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood was the only Southeast-Long Beach team to advance to a state title 
game. The Dominguez, Long Beach Poly and St. Paul boys and the Valley Christian 
girls reached the Southern Regional semifinals in their respective divisions 
before being eliminated last week. COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach City College men's basketball team established a new standard 
for success with its 63-61 win over Ventura in the state community college 
championship game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the school's first title since 1976 and fifth in its history. That 
enabled Long Beach to pass South Coast Conference rival Cerritos for the most 
championships in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 For Long Beach Coach Gary Anderson, it was the third time he has had a hand in 
a championship at the school. He played for the Viking team that won a title in 
1971 under Lute Olson, now coach at the University of Arizona. Anderson was 
also an assistant under Coach Bill Fraser when Long Beach won in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings were led to their latest championship by forward Kevin Beal, who 
scored 19 points and had eight rebounds, and guard Marcus Rogers with 17 points 
and seven steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Sharif Metoyer, who finished with only four points, scored the 
winning basket with 1 minute 44 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning the title, the Vikings defeated a Ventura squad that had been 
ranked No. 1 in the state all season. It was the second year in a row that 
Ventura had been seeded No. 1, only to lose in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach City College football Coach Larry Reisbig, who guided the Vikings 
to their first postseason appearance in 29 years, has been named state coach of 
the year by Cal-Hi Sports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisbig guided Long Beach to a 9-2 record, its first winning season in nearly 
a decade. The Vikings lost to Fresno City College, 18-15, in the Dairy Bowl in 
December. It was their first bowl appearance since the 1965 Prune Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Reisbig is 14-6-1 in two seasons at Long Beach. COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State baseball team is already off to a flying start. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers, who won their second consecutive Big West Conference title last 
year en route to a third-place finish in the College World Series, are 16-3. 
They are ranked No. 4 by Collegiate Baseball magazine and fifth by Baseball 
Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach plays host to eighth-ranked Wichita State (7-3) for games Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday at Blair Field in Long Beach. The Shockers reached the 
World Series final last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wichita has been led by second baseman Joey Jackson with a .350 batting 
average and pitcher Jason Jordan, who is 3-0 with a 2.20 earned-run average in 
five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the key to Long Beach's success has been its pitching, which did not 
allow an earned run in a three-game sweep of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last 
week. Leading the way have been starters Scott Rivette at 5-0 with a 1.53 ERA 
and Mike Fontana at 3-0 with a 1.73 ERA. Gabe Gonzalez has also sparkled in 
relief with a 1.15 ERA and seven saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman designated hitter and first baseman Jeff Tagliaferri is batting .457 
and junior outfielder Nic Frank is at .375. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State men's basketball team, which was eliminated from 
postseason contention with an 87-74 loss to Pacific in the Big West Conference 
tournament last week, has had four of its players receive all-conference 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Rod Hannibal made the all-conference first team, junior forward 
Mike Atkinson made second team, and junior center Terrance O'Kelley received 
honorable mention. Swingman James Cotton was named freshman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, a former standout at St. John Bosco High, was the leading freshman 
scorer in the Big West with an 11.4-point average. Hannibal and Atkinson both 
averaged 15.6 points during the regular season for the 49ers, who finished 
17-10. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Scott of Long Beach State became the first athlete from the Big West 
Conference to earn first team all-conference honors in two sports when she 
named to the women's basketball team last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In volleyball, Scott was the 1993 national player of the year and 1992 and 
1993 Big West player of the year, having led the 49ers to the national title 
last season. In basketball, the 6-2 center led the Big West in rebounding with 
a 10.4 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach teammate Melissa Gower, a 6-1 forward who averaged 16 points and 
9.8 rebounds, was named to the all-conference second team. BRIEFLY 
</P>
<P>
 Former St. Joseph High and UCLA standout Lisa Fernandez has been named female 
winner of the Amateur Softball Assn.'s first Amoco USA Softball Leadership 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is based on athletic achievement, leadership and community 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, who is hoping to compete for the United States in the 1996 Summer 
Olympics, was a four-time All-America selection at UCLA and was named the ASA 
sportswoman of the year in 1991 and 1992. She also won the 1992-93 
Honda-Broderick Cup as the nation's outstanding female collegiate athlete.

ENTERTAINMENT; OFFBEAT SCREW RADIO BROADENS ITS SCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Greg Ginn began to lease time on radio station KWIZ (96.7) in Santa Ana 
last July, his principal intentions were to learn how to produce a radio show 
and to give valuable exposure to artists on his own SST, Cruz and New Alliance 
record labels. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fairly shrewd maneuver considering that virtually all of Ginn's 
adventurous bands and spoken word artists -- a group that includes noise-punk 
unit Rig, avant-jazz group Bazooka and poet Wanda Coleman -- routinely are 
shunned by commercial radio. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Ginn's indelicately dubbed Screw Radio program, which is 
broadcast from Ginn's recording studio in Long Beach, broadened its scope. No 
longer just a platform from which to plug a designated set of underground 
artists, it now is part rock, part talk and part comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to go on the radio and just play music," said Ginn, who first came 
to prominence in the early '80s as the guitarist and primary songwriter for the 
trailblazing Los Angeles punk band Black Flag. "So it was important to have 
another element that revealed the (irreverent, satirical) vibe surrounding the 
record labels. The show's picked up a lot of listeners through the talk and 
humor, and that's turned a lot of new people on to the music." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which can be heard weeknights and Sundays from midnight to 1 a.m. 
and Saturdays and Sundays from 8 to 10 p.m., is given its offbeat character by 
nerdy host "Poindexter Stewart" and his loyal sidekicks, two Southern rednecks 
named Jimbo and Buford. Between sets of songs, the three spout off about 
anything and everything from their distaste for Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder 
to the logic behind the latest Los Angeles Clippers basketball trade. They also 
field calls from listeners, many of whom seem to share their wacky irreverence 
and sometimes risque sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Poindexter Stewart actually is the usually mild-mannered and soft-spoken Ginn 
in the guise of a wimpy, whiny and slightly hyper radio personality and 
alternative rock musician (Ginn even released an album under the Stewart name 
last year). 
</P>
<P>
 "The character is kind of modeled after the most irritating person I can 
imagine," Ginn explained with a laugh. "It started as a parody of what I see as 
the superficial elements in the (alternative rock) record business. It's kind 
of a slacker thing: The character is lazy but expects a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's more complicated than that. That's the starting off point for 
Poindexter Stewart. I also try to make a lot of my own points with it, even 
though they're kind of coming from this lame personality.' 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, for instance, Screw Radio gets on a decidedly political track. 
Ginn recalls one program that turned into a lengthy and heated debate over 
illegal immigration, with listeners on both sides of the issue calling in. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the talk, though, is loose chatter and humor, especially during the 
two-hour weekend shows. Ginn said some regular callers have gone as far as to 
create their own specific characters for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "One regular calls in and sings Black Flag songs with this (Latino) accent," 
Ginn said. "He totally changes the words to the songs. We have the greatest 
regular callers. It's amazing how creative they've been." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ginn said he doesn't want the phone calls and jokes to overshadow the 
music being played. The show not only features prerecorded music but also band 
interviews and occasional live performances by SST, New Alliance and Cruz 
artists. The instrumental group Gone -- which includes Ginn, bassist Steve 
Sharp (who plays the Jimbo character) and drummer Gregory Moore -- is the 
program's official house band. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondays are devoted entirely to the music of Black Flag. In what can be seen 
as a measure of the group's tremendous influence, Ginn notes that the 
listenership on Mondays includes many young people who latched onto Black Flag 
after its breakup in 1986. The band's bassist, Chuck Dukowski, "came on 
recently and we got a lot of calls and a lot of questions. I don't remember any 
of the callers actually having seen the band." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginn said he enjoys hosting the program. "It's a stretch because I have a lot 
of other things to do, but I like radio so much that it's really like a dream 
come true."

to introduce students to classical drawing. They are Brenda Zuniga of Whittier, 
Connie Chung of Cerritos, Bryan Heggie of Long Beach, and Jorge Ramos of South 
Gate. The program, which includes workshops and a gallery show, is named in 
memory of a Disney artist who worked on animated movies and the original design 
concept for Disneyland.

POLICE SAY RANDOM SHOOTING WASN'T; SON, WIFE CHARGED IN WOMAN'S DEATH; 
VIOLENCE: VICTIM HAD BEEN STANDING ON BALCONY OF THEIR SANTA ANA APARTMENT WHEN 
SHE WAS KILLED. POLICE SAY COUPLE'S STORY DOESN'T MATCH EVIDENCE.

 The son and daughter-in-law of a woman who was shot to death on her balcony 
Sunday evening -- originally thought to be the victim of random street violence 
-- were arrested Wednesday as suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The son, Santos Alvarez Roque, had told police that his mother had been the 
victim of gang gunfire, and in an interview this week tearfully begged people 
"not to be so cruel, to think about the people who are affected" by the 
careless use of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Maria Bruno Soto, both 24, were arrested on suspicion of 
homicide after police discovered discrepancies between their accounts of the 
killing and physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just about the time I think I know everything," Police Lt. Robert Helton 
said, "you get thrown a curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Valentina Roque, a 55-year-old grandmother who came here from Mexico eight 
months ago and was planning to return soon, was shot once in the chest on the 
balcony of her son and daughter-in-law's apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 Helton said that investigators became suspicious as they talked to the couple 
and analyzed the evidence at the crime scene and in the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the inconsistencies of their statements and the physical evidence -- 
which I cannot discuss with you -- the investigators believe that (Alvarez and 
Soto) are responsible for the homicide of Mrs. Roque," Helton said. 
"Originally, from what we were told, (we believed) there were some people down 
on the street corner and someone from that street corner fired several bullets, 
one of which struck Mrs. Roque. . . . Through interviews and the investigation 
and the physical evidence, we do not believe that to be the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Helton would not say what the motive was or how the shooting happened. But 
police still believe the shot came from outside. They are seeking a 
small-caliber handgun that belongs to Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, at about the same time investigators began to suspect that Alvarez 
was the killer, he told The Times, "I am a Catholic and believe that whomever 
did this will pay before God." Weeping, he guessed that his mother had been the 
victim of gang- or drug-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year-old boy who was arrested Monday on suspicion of the Roque shooting 
after he reportedly pointed a gun at a police officer is no longer a suspect, 
Helton said. However, the boy remains at Juvenile Hall because police believe 
he was involved in another shooting in the same neighborhood Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Roque, who was the 17th homicide victim in Santa Ana this year, has five 
children, three of whom live in this country. For the past eight months, she 
has lived in the Casa Serena apartment building with Alvarez, Soto and their 
2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shock to all of us because they're really nice people," said Margarita 
Pacheco, 23, who lives in Casa Serena near Roque's apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco and other neighbors said the family was close, often going to the 
market together. A few minutes after the shooting Sunday night, Pacheco said, 
she heard Alvarez screaming "My mom! My mom!"  
</P>
<P>
 "He was really torn up about it," she remembered, stunned to learn that 
Alvarez was now under suspicion himself. "They did stuff together constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Benita Duarte, a close friend of the family, said earlier this week that 
"there were no rivalries" in the family. "He is a tranquil person," she said of 
Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez works at a local manufacturing plant, and told reporters that he 
brought his mother to the United States last year because he feared for her 
health. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved my old lady and I wanted to take care of her because she no longer is 
a young woman and things are hard for her back home," he said. Promising to 
move from the apartment where Roque was killed, he added: "This apartment will 
bring me only memories of her, and I find that unbearable. We have to move 
away, perhaps back to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez and Soto are held in the city's jail, and bail has been set at 
$250,000 each.

OSBOURNE FAN INJURED IN IRVINE CONCERT MELEE AWARDED $60,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury on Wednesday decided that rock star Ozzy 
Osbourne's insurance company should pay $60,000 to a Burbank electrician who 
claims he was trampled after the singer invited a heavy metal crowd to join him 
onstage during a 1992 concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The same jury had earlier decided that Osbourne, who has been known to bite 
the heads off live bats during concerts, was negligent when he issued the 
invitation that caused the stampede at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Allan Winkler, 43, claimed he was trampled in the melee and suffered a 
torn rotator cuff, a shoulder injury. He filed a civil lawsuit against 
Osbourne, the concert hall and its security firm, seeking $250,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really disheartening," said Winkler's attorney, William I. Goldsmith 
of Tarzana, who added that his client deserved a much bigger award for his 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sends the wrong message to performers that juries will not compensate 
people for pain and suffering," Goldsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney for Osbourne's insurance company, Philip D. Weiss of 
Universal City, said he was relieved that the jury did not award Winkler more 
money. Jurors decided to compensate Winkler for only past medical expenses and 
lost wages, and awarded him $10,000 for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said that although Osbourne's actions were "a really stupid thing to 
do," Winkler failed to prove he suffered a torn rotator cuff, which the 
electrician said would require expensive surgery and several months away from 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 Weiss contended that Winkler's shoulder injury was less serious than the 
electrician and his attorney had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because Ozzy Osbourne is a star, they treated this like the lottery," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 28, 1992, Osbourne was finishing a show at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre when, according to court testimony, the singer told the audience 
he wanted to make it a night to remember and invited them to join his band 
onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 people surged toward the stage after Osbourne's invitation, 
according to testimony. Some concert-goers jumped over seats while others 
flooded the aisles leading to the stage. Several people were treated for minor 
cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler testified that he was trying to leave the concert when he was trampled 
by boisterous fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found that Irvine Meadows was not liable for the mishap, nor was the 
security company working that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Miserendino, a spokesman for the amphitheater, said he was pleased with 
the trial's outcome because concert organizers had warned Osbourne's agent 
about the dangers of inviting the crowd onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had taken every precaution that you could, but if an artist decided to 
create an unsafe situation, they can certainly do that," Miserendino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly would like to have (Osbourne) back in the future," he said, "but 
we would hope next time he would avoid asking the crowd to join him."

TWO TEEN-AGERS FACE CHARGES IN BEACH RAPE; CRIME: ARRESTS FOLLOW AN 8-MONTH 
INVESTIGATION INTO LAGUNA ASSAULTS LAST JULY. A THIRD SUSPECT IS STILL AT 
LARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After an eight-month investigation, police arrested two Ontario teen-agers 
Wednesday morning on a variety of charges in connection with a rape last summer 
on Crescent Bay Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Floyd Robert Sullivan, 18, and a 17-year-old boy face charges of 
robbery, kidnaping, false imprisonment, rape, sodomy and assault with a deadly 
weapon for their alleged roles in the incident that shocked residents here last 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 A third suspect, identified as Robert Robles, 22, is at large and is believed 
to be in Northern California, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail at Orange County Jail. The 
17-year-old, whose name was withheld because he is a minor, is being held at 
Orange County Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a heinous crime. Anytime that somebody is raped, brutally raped, and 
sodomized on the beach that's a very bad crime. It rates right up there," said 
Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Lance Ishmael. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests were "the culmination of an awful lot of work," Ishmael said. 
"This particular incident required a lot of tenacity on the part of our 
investigators. It was a whodunit right from the beginning. Through some very 
diligent and hard work on the investigators' part, we were able to piece this 
thing together." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports of the incident, a 20-year-old Pomona man and his 
19-year-old La Habra girlfriend were sitting on the beach about 1 a.m. when 
three young men approached them wielding a shotgun and baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the men bound the boyfriend while the third held the shotgun to his 
head. Then the man with the shotgun took the woman -- her hands tied -- to 
another area of the beach and repeatedly raped her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the woman was being assaulted, her boyfriend freed himself and began 
searching for her, police said. One of the attackers allegedly pointed the 
shotgun at him and tried to fire it, but the weapon did not discharge, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers fled, and the victims went to a local market to call police. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months and dozens of interviews later, Laguna Beach detectives and 
Ontario police gathered enough evidence to make arrests. They served warrants 
at the suspects' homes early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you a sense of satisfaction to be able to catch the people 
responsible for a crime as violent as this one," Laguna Beach Detective Hector 
Pantoja said. "When you start out with a crime that you have basically nothing 
to go on, and after a very long investigation, you're able to produce some 
results, it's very satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how the case was solved, Pantoja said, "We got some tips that we 
corroborated, then we did some stakeouts, we followed some people, we took some 
pictures, and did some lineups." 
</P>
<P>
 Pantoja said the suspects confirmed that they are members of a gang, but 
investigators are unsure whether the robbery-rape had any gang connection.

D.A. TO RELEASE NEARLY EVERYTHING FROM FILES ON DEPUTY'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors, seeking to erase lingering suspicions in the 
community over the Christmas Day shooting death of Sheriff's Deputy Darryn 
Leroy Robins, said Wednesday that they will make public virtually everything in 
their investigative files on the controversial case. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the investigative materials to be made available to the media on Friday 
or Monday is a 90-minute videotaped interview with Deputy Brian P. Scanlan, 
conducted hours after authorities say he shot Robins to death during an 
impromptu training exercise.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office effectively closed its case on the shooting 
last week after the Orange County Grand Jury decided not to indict Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they had recommended during secret grand jury deliberations 
earlier this month that Scanlan be charged with involuntary manslaughter 
because of alleged gross negligence in the shooting. But the panel -- in a rare 
rejection of the district attorney's recommendation -- decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said the decision to release the case files 
is aimed at answering community members who have questioned whether race played 
a part in the incident or in the handling of the investigation that followed 
it. Robins, 30, was black, and Scanlan, 32, is white. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had complaints in the press from various people that have had no basis 
in fact, and we want to clear that up," Conley said. "I suspect that there are 
some people out there who will never be satisfied, but this should satisfy 
reasonable observers." 
</P>
<P>
 Community members on both sides of the volatile issue welcomed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very good step, an excellent step," said Randall Jordan, publisher 
of a black-oriented local magazine called Black Orange, who is part of a 
minority coalition created in the wake of the shooting to push for more 
information on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would allow the information to get out, just as we've been asking all 
along, and it would allow the average citizen to come up with an educated 
decision as to what happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never said this was not an accident, but the information we had so 
far did not give us a good feeling about what happened. We've tried to be 
open-minded," he said. If the information released by prosecutors "sounds fair 
and makes sense," Jordan said he could "guarantee" that black leaders would 
accept the official explanation for the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least for now, black leaders plan to press ahead with their call for a 
federal investigation into possible civil rights violations in the shooting. 
Outraged by the grand jury's decision, black leaders plan to send a first batch 
of letters as early as today to the U.S. Justice Department, attacking the 
handling of the case by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that process is going to stop," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert MacLeod, general manager of the Orange County Deputy Sheriffs Assn., 
said members of the local law enforcement community "will be anxious to see 
what information the investigation revealed. . . . They loved Darryn Robins, 
and they certainly want to know that the investigation was full and complete, 
as I'm sure it was." 
</P>
<P>
 But MacLeod said that while he is certain that the new information will 
satisfy "a reasonable person," he has his doubts about critics in the minority 
community. "The people who are using this terrible incident for their own 
political purposes will not be satisfied. They want to further their own 
agenda, and the facts be damned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said prosecutors plan to release everything in their investigative 
files on the case, except for personnel records deemed confidential under state 
law. They also will provide copies to the media of videotapes made from patrol 
cars that show a training session just before the shooting, the route to the 
hospital after the shooting, and a distraught Scanlan at the hospital imploring 
Robins to "pull through," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities will allow reporters to view the videotaped interview with 
Scanlan, Conley said. But unlike the other pieces of evidence, he said, they 
will not release actual copies of that critical tape -- in part because of 
concern for Scanlan's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is unindicted . . . and we didn't think it was fair to him to have (the 
tape) playing on television on channels 2, 4, 6, 8 and whatever," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said prosecutors also worried that allowing a tape of Scanlan's voluntary 
statement to be shown on television could "definitely" discourage officers in 
future incidents from cooperating in investigations and agreeing to be 
interviewed by authorities.

'MATCH DAY' JITTERS; MEDICINE: AT ANNUAL UCI CEREMONY, MEDICAL STUDENTS LEARN 
WHERE THEY'LL INTERN. FOR SOME, THEIR INTERNSHIPS WILL TAKE THEM ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. OTHERS, TO THEIR RELIEF, WILL REMAIN HERE. 
</P>

 Nearly 30 years ago, in a mostly black neighborhood of San Diego, a doctor 
inspired a little girl to learn the art of healing by curing her 
life-threatening tumor. 
</P>
<P>
 Much time passed, but the girl never forgot her dream of becoming a doctor 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Wednesday, Wanda Wilburn, now almost 40, joined her UCI College of 
Medicine classmates in the annual "Match Day" ceremony, where students learn 
where they will begin their medical careers when they graduate in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so very, very happy. It's been a lot of mountains," Wilburn said, hugging 
her friends and jumping for joy as she learned she will intern at Emory 
University Hospital in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-nine students quietly held hands with friends and relatives in the 
sunny quadrangle in front of Irvine Hall, taking a deep breath as they waited 
for their turn to approach the lectern and receive an envelope holding their 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closer we get, the more nervous I am," said Mary Anne Fuchs, 27. "You 
don't know whether you're going to be near your family, friends and significant 
others."  
</P>
<P>
 To lighten the mood, administrators asked each student to throw a dollar bill 
in a doctor's bag, as a consolation prize for the tortured wreck who is called 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, graduating medical students choose their specialties and the 
teaching hospitals where they want to train, and then hope for the best as the 
hospitals choose students for internships.  
</P>
<P>
 All medical students throughout the nation received their envelopes at noon 
Wednesday in similar ceremonies that for many are more important than 
graduation because their intern assignments determine the course of their 
careers, said UCI Associate Dean of Student Affairs Deborah Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Students spend one to five years as interns and residents at their assigned 
hospitals, and a large percentage practice in the community where they are 
trained, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Munden, 33, screamed and sprayed her friends with champagne after she 
peeked in her envelope and saw "University of California, Irvine" printed in 
black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband doesn't have to find a new job, and my kids don't have to move," 
Munden said ecstatically.  
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Kris Tewari, 29, also flashed a relieved smile when he realized he 
would train as an obstetrician-gynecologist at Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking about this for 365 days straight," he said. "Second to 
when I proposed to my girlfriend, this is the most stressful thing."  
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Sujata Tewari, a psychiatry professor at UC Irvine, said she "went 
blank" when her son's name was called and the fateful moment arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been wanting it so much. It's all we've been talking about at the 
house," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of the 89 students in this year's graduating class specialized in 
primary-care medicine. That number is much greater than the national average, 
which was 12.9% last year, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Primary-care doctors practice internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, 
and in California, obstetrics, and are short in number compared to colleagues 
in higher-paying specialties, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the trend in medical education is to encourage more students to enter 
primary care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilburn said she decided to become an obstetrician-gynecologist after working 
12 years as a physician's assistant in Los Angeles. She is looking forward to 
working at Emory University and serving a "large inner-city population," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt," she added, "that there was a need for female (doctors) in that 
particular area, (and) I felt I could relate to those patients."

EVIDENCE OF BUILDING'S COLLAPSE IS FOCUS OF LEGAL FIGHT; QUAKE DEATHS: OWNER OF 
NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS APARTMENT COMPLEX SEEKS TO PREVENT PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF A 
PRIVATE INVESTIGATION INTO DAMAGE. LAWYER FOR VICTIMS' FAMILIES SAYS THE PUBLIC 
INTEREST IS AT STAKE. 
</P>

<P>
 The owner of the Northridge Meadows apartments, where 16 people died in the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, has asked a judge to keep secret the results of a private 
investigation into how and why the building collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for complex owner Shashikant Jogani and relatives of two women crushed 
in their first-floor apartments will argue Friday morning in a Van Nuys 
courtroom whether potential evidence of construction defects should become 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Jogani's attorney, Robert M. Freeman, requested a court order preventing 
release of photographs and videotapes of the collapsed complex while a lawsuit 
works its way through the courts. He also requested a gag order preventing the 
families' lawyer, Joel B. Castro, from discussing the findings of his 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Wednesday, Castro asserted that a compelling public interest 
is at stake. "I don't want this thing buried. I want this thing out while 
people are revising the codes," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Seismic Safety Commission as well as the city's Building and Safety 
Code Committee and the Los Angeles police and fire departments have asked 
Castro to release results of the investigation, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 William L. Cerone, whose 80-year-old mother was crushed to death in Apt. 103, 
said he is "too numb" to be angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do they want a gag order? It makes me very suspect. I just think that 
there's nothing wrong with the truth. It may attract enough attention in the 
right areas where this can be avoided in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Syd Dalven, 75, who was pulled from the wrecked building by rescue crews and 
joined the lawsuit Wednesday, agreed: "I think that's terrible after what 
people have gone through. Sixteen lives were lost and my two best friends were 
killed, and now they want to withhold things." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal maneuvering arose out of the first known quake-related lawsuit. 
Relatives of quake victims Anna Cerone and Bea Reskin have accused the 
building's owner, architect and builder of negligence in a Feb. 15 wrongful 
death lawsuit, and are seeking unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, engineers and other construction experts hired by both parties 
combed the rubble of Northridge Meadows for three days, searching for clues to 
explain why the three-story building pancaked into its first floor. They also 
photographed and videotaped the site, which has been preserved under a previous 
court order barring demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said his investigators have found construction defects, but he declined 
to discuss specifics before the hearing Friday. In court papers, however, 
Castro said the site could serve as a seismic safety "test lab" as various 
public agencies study the adequacy of current building codes and inspection 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, the attorney for the owner, contends that premature disclosure of the 
findings -- gathered by the lawyer suing his client -- would irreparably harm 
Jogani's reputation and create a media circus. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Freeman said that Jogani is not opposed to releasing results 
to public agencies as long as they are not fed to the media. "We want to help. 
We are not trying to hide anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said he feared Castro could use the findings to enlist more clients 
against Jogani and the other defendants. And he said the television media could 
"exploit" the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are dealing with is a scene of death and destruction," Freeman said. 
"We allowed him to inspect and photograph the scene, but our understanding was 
it would be used for the lawsuit." He added that he feared media attention 
could prejudice prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the families filed suit, the case has generated little notice. On March 
1, Castro sought a court order preventing destruction of what he described as 
"crucial evidence" during demolition. Whether Jogani planned to quickly 
demolish the apartments is just one of many points of dispute in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agreed to a "controlled demolition," removing sections of the 
building piece by piece while engineers investigate the buried first floor. The 
careful dismantling of the building also will give survivors and relatives of 
the dead time to retrieve belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition, estimated to cost $500,000, has not been scheduled. According 
to court records, Jogani said he has no funds for the costly job, and city 
officials have negotiated for funding through the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Shashikant and Renuka Jogani, the owners, the suit names 
builders Brian L. Heller and Burton S. Ury, architect Morris Brown and 
structural engineer Woodward Tom.  
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said his client is not responsible for the tragedy, which he called an 
"act of God." 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks following the quake, engineers and city Building and Safety 
officials have said plywood-reinforced shear walls could have helped the 
building withstand the tremors. But building codes in force at the time the 
building's plans were approved did not require them. 
</P>
<P>
 Property records show that Northridge Meadows was built in 1972 by Heller 
Construction. Jogani bought the building from Brian Heller in 1981.

LETTER SEEKS FUNDS FOR IMPRISONED KOON; LAPD BEATING: THE PLEA, SEEMINGLY 
WRITTEN BY THE CONVICTED FORMER SERGEANT, PORTRAYS HIM AS A SCAPEGOAT. IT 
STRETCHES TRUTH, DESCRIBING RODNEY KING AS A PCP-CRAZED MURDER SUSPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The book publisher for Stacey C. Koon, the former Los Angeles police sergeant 
serving prison time in the beating of Rodney G. King, has circulated a mass 
appeal for donations to help Koon's family and to help him appeal his federal 
civil rights conviction as far as the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, which purports to be written by Koon and bears his letterhead and 
signature, has been sent out nationwide in recent months under the auspices of 
the "Stacey Koon Defense Fund," operated out of a mail drop in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 It has generated much financial support from police officers and others for 
Koon, his wife and their five children, according to Koon's Washington-based 
book publisher, who organized the fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, which the publisher said was largely written by Koon, King is 
lambasted as a PCP-crazed homicide suspect at the time of his arrest who never 
was struck in the head with police batons and "only suffered minor injuries 
when finally forced to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 These are assertions that court evidence, and even one of Koon's former 
lawyers, say are unproven or untrue. Koon, serving 30 months in federal prison 
in Dublin, Calif., could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-page typeset letter also claims that Koon and former Officer Laurence 
M. Powell, also serving time in the King beating, "are the political scapegoats 
of black radicals and self-serving liberal politicians who know that we are 
innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter quotes Koon as saying that when the whole story comes out, people 
will be "shocked, stunned and convinced that my officers and I were sold out by 
weak politicians and a deceitful news media." Until then, he asks readers of 
the letter for as much as $1,000 each so he and Powell can appeal their cases 
and get out of prison before they are killed by police-hating inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will take dollars," the letter says, "lots of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The publisher of Koon's book, "Presumed Guilty, The Tragedy of the Rodney King 
Affair," said this week that he came up with the fund-raising idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred S. Regnery, president of Regnery Publishing Inc., said most of the 
money raised will go to Koon's family and to pay his legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that included in the letter is a sales pitch asking 
readers to make a donation of $30 or more to get a copy of Koon's book. Copies 
of the book are being given to the defense fund at "slightly over cost," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising appeal is aimed at the general public as well as police 
officers and has generated thousands of responses and donations, Regnery said. 
He would not say how much money has been raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the defense fund is not a political entity or charitable group, it 
does not have to report to the state or federal governments how much money it 
raises, and how much of that it passes along to its intended benefactor, 
according to the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon and three other white officers beat King, who is black, after he led them 
on an eight-mile chase and refused to pull over his car on March 3, 1991. All 
four were acquitted of state charges, and the verdicts ignited three days of 
rioting in Los Angeles. Koon and Powell were later convicted in U.S. District 
Court of violating King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officials declined to comment on the letter, which several 
people involved in the case say contains inaccuracies or unproven facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see defendants do this type of fund raising, but it is problematic when 
it becomes deceptive and misleading," said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Law School 
professor who monitored the federal trial last year. 
</P>
<P>
 There are laws that prohibit the use of the mail to obtain money through 
misleading communications, but Levenson said she doubted Koon would be cited. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the claim in the letter that King was high on PCP, blood tests did not 
find evidence that he had used the drug before he was subdued by Koon and his 
fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also suggests that King was treated roughly by officers at the 
scene because he was "the prime suspect in a homicide at the time of his 
arrest" -- another contention prosecutors and defense lawyers agree is untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how such a claim made its way into the letter, Regnery said: "I can't 
remember where that came from." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the letter's assertions that King was injured only by falling to 
the ground, doctors who testified for the prosecution at Koon's federal trial 
said King's face was fractured in 15 places, probably from blows landed by a 
police baton or similar weapon. Doctors who testified for the defense disputed 
that account, saying that King's injuries were in fact the result of one or 
more face-first falls to the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon's lawyer in the state case, Darryl Mounger, said he found it hard to 
believe that the former sergeant would include such inaccuracies and contested 
facts in a public appeal for money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly doesn't sound like something Stacey would do," Mounger said. "I 
would not think Stacey Koon would acquiesce to someone else writing that 
letter, certainly because some things in there are not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Regnery, however, maintains that the fund-raising drive is a sincere effort to 
help Koon. He said he and Koon became friends when Koon spent a week at his 
house during a promotional tour for the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon's wife, Mary, prefers not to comment about her family's plight, Regnery 
said. But in the letter, Koon says his wife has "suffered horribly" through the 
ordeal, as have his five children. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Koon's legal bills already have been paid -- the Los Angeles police 
union paid at least $150,000 for his lawyers and court costs in the two trials. 
But Regnery and others said Koon's bills probably will climb as his appeal 
proceeds, and that his family's expenses are mounting while he is in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government also has appealed Koon's sentencing. Federal prosecutors 
say Koon and Powell received lenient sentences because U.S. District Judge John 
G. Davies erred in calculating what would be appropriate under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspended without pay in 1991, Koon was dismissed from the department several 
weeks ago after an administrative hearing. His lawyers have contended he was 
treated unfairly by the city, which did not pay his legal bills as it has in 
some other cases, and for suspending him without pay before resolution of the 
case.

SVORINICH SUPPORT FOR PROJECT CRITICIZED; POLITICS: THE CITY HAS OPPOSED A 
DEVELOPMENT INVOLVING ONE OF HIS CAMPAIGN DONORS. NEW ALLEGATIONS ARE MADE 
ABOUT UNREPORTED FUNDS. THE COUNCILMAN DENIES ANY IMPROPRIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Months after the Port of Los Angeles raised serious environmental objections 
to a proposed waterfront development, Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. endorsed the multimillion-dollar project whose principals include 
one of his campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's support of the project involving Union Pacific Resources Corp. 
came in a letter his former chief deputy claims was written by a local attorney 
for the company -- a letter that dumbfounded officials at the Port of Los 
Angeles. "We were stunned, actually, because (Svorinich's letter) was directly 
contrary" to a lawsuit the city of Los Angeles filed concerning the project, 
said a city official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, another former aide to Svorinich has told The Times he saw the 
councilman with an envelope containing far more in political contributions from 
Union Pacific Resources than Svorinich has reported. Svorinich's most recent 
campaign report shows $1,400 in contributions from Union Pacific and half a 
dozen of its employees. But former aide John Barbieri claims he went through 
the envelope and saw at least a dozen checks, totaling $4,000 to $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the allegedly unreported contributions and Svorinich's support of the 
Union Pacific Resources project have been reported to the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office and the city's Ethics Commission. Both agencies have 
refused to confirm or deny investigations into Svorinich, but have interviewed 
five former aides to the councilman on these and other matters in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich has denied any impropriety, insisting that all his campaign 
contributions have been reported. He also blamed his letter of support for the 
project on a miscommunication. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific Resources officials involved in the project did not return phone 
calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest allegations against Svorinich come two months after his former 
chief deputy and longtime friend, John Vidovich, resigned from the freshman 
councilman's office, sparking a staff upheaval that led to five other firings 
or resignations. Since then, former aides have leveled various accusations 
against Svorinich, whose district runs from San Pedro to Watts. The aides have 
alleged that campaign contributions were brought to Svorinich's city office and 
that he and an aide have done work for his Wilmington paint store on city time 
-- both potential violations of city ethics laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich has strongly denied those allegations, saying they are the 
fabrications of disgruntled ex-employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The new allegations center on a powerful ally of Svorinich -- Union Pacific 
Resources, a real estate subsidiary of the Texas-based railroad. The subsidiary 
is also a prominent player in Harbor-area development and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the company announced plans to sell to the Port of Long Beach about 
750 acres on Terminal Island for just over $400 million. The parcel included 
property that would be used by Toyota Corp. for a new 31-acre auto storage 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials, including those at the port, quickly raised concerns 
about the project, both because it would be an economic boon for the competing 
Port of Long Beach and because 240 acres of the property were designated a 
state Superfund site. The designation was made after reports that tons of toxic 
waste and chemicals were dumped on the acreage during the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 So serious was Los Angeles about potential hazards at the site that the city 
sued Long Beach last June, alleging that a full environmental impact assessment 
should be required before the sale could go through. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months after filing of the lawsuit, and on the same day the Port of 
Los Angeles reiterated its demand for a full environmental report, Svorinich 
sent a letter to the Port of Long Beach strongly endorsing the Union Pacific 
Resources-Toyota portion of the project -- a key component of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 That project, Svorinich's Sept. 22 letter says, "is one that is 
environmentally and economically desirable. The project benefits the 
environment by developing portions of existing oil field properties into a 
state-of-the-art automobile processing facility that will mean hundreds of jobs 
and economic benefits to our communities." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter flabbergasted Los Angeles port officials, according to several who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity. Said one: "Here we were trying to show 
there were environmental problems and he comes out with a letter supporting the 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another: "Svorinich shouldn't have done it. And what do I make of it? 
That Union Pacific (Resources) made a contribution and got a favor out of it. 
It's pretty simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Without making that charge, Svorinich's former chief deputy Vidovich has 
claimed that the councilman's letter was written by San Pedro attorney Carmen 
Trutanich, a prominent fund-raiser for Svorinich whose law firm has represented 
Union Pacific Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 22 letter, Vidovich told The Times, was faxed to Svorinich's City 
Hall office by Trutanich and brought to Svorinich on the council floor. "And 
Rudy said to put it on council stationery and he would sign it," said Vidovich, 
who last month told The Times that Trutanich once tried to drop off an envelope 
of campaign contributions at Svorinich's San Pedro office. 
</P>
<P>
 Trutanich denied that allegation when contacted last month. He did not return 
recent phone calls about the Sept. 22 letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich, meanwhile, denied that the letter was written by Trutanich. 
Instead, he claimed, it was drafted by a former staff member. "I don't remember 
who," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the letter caused an uproar among Port of Los Angeles officials, a 
second letter was sent to the Port of Long Beach softening Svorinich's mention 
of the project's environmental benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Svorinich blamed the first letter on "a lack of communication" 
between the Port of Los Angeles and his office, former aides Vidovich and 
Barbieri said the councilman had long been aware of the concerns about the 
project's potential environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But Svorinich, Barbieri told The Times, seemed unconcerned about that issue. 
In fact, Barbieri claims, Svorinich made it clear he would not alienate 
prominent political supporters over environmental issues on a site such as 
Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "What . . . do I care about a toxic dump on Terminal Island?" Barbieri quoted 
Svorinich as saying in one closed-door meeting. "Least terns don't vote." 
</P>
<P>
 At that same meeting in Svorinich's San Pedro office, Barbieri claims, he also 
saw the councilman with an envelope containing far more in contributions 
connected to Union Pacific Resources than Svorinich's last campaign disclosure 
report reflects. The report, filed last month, listed $1,400 in contributions 
from the company and several of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbieri claims he saw thousands more in contribution checks, ranging in 
amounts from $50 to $500. They included, he alleged, one check for $200 or $250 
from a Union Pacific Resources employee he knows. The check, Barbieri claims, 
had the employee's name but the post office box number for Union Pacific 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's reports do not list the employee as a contributor. The employee 
did not return numerous phone calls for an interview about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman insisted that his campaign reports are complete. "All the 
checks from UP and any of (its) employees are reported," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbieri's claims, he added, are "another version of the smear of the week" 
directed at him by his former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich's press secretary, Tom Kruesopon, added: "I think the community of 
San Pedro and the people of the 15th District want the councilman to accomplish 
the job he was sent to do and they are smarter than to believe the words and 
unsubstantiated allegations of fired employees."  
</P>
<P>
 Noting Svorinich's recent weeklong trip to Washington, D.C., on a variety of 
projects, Kruesopon also said: "We are trying to accomplish a job and we will 
not be distracted by the selfishness and self-serving interests of these former 
staffers."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 'PADDY 
WAGONS' OFFER FREE RIDES HOME FOR HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fleet of decorated St. Patrick's Day "Paddy Wagons" will roam the streets 
today to take drinking party-goers home as the safety program expands citywide 
in its fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
 Off-duty police officers will drive 17 vans donated by Budget Rent-A-Car, but 
there is no threat of arrest for those who take advantage of the free 
program.People wanting a ride home simply telephone their nearest police 
station. A white van festooned with green shamrocks will respond. The idea is 
to keep drunk drivers off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sign of boldness that the LAPD is able to go out and again provide 
such a great program," Police Chief Willie L. Williams said during a news 
conference announcing the expanded program. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Patrick's Day program served only the San Fernando Valley in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a night like St. Patrick's Day when people party with alcohol, this is a 
way to help them be responsible," said Jeff Mirkin, president of Budget 
Rent-A-Car Southern California. "If they've had too much to drink, they can go 
home in one of these vans and be safe and responsible."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
EX-PROBATION OFFICER PLEADS GUILTY TO CHILD PORN CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles County probation officer has pleaded guilty to federal 
child pornography charges, federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 In pleading guilty to six counts of producing child pornography, Glenn Alan 
Nelson, 46, admitted he traveled to Thailand in 1991 to engage in sexually 
explicit conduct with boys under 18, Assistant U.S. Atty.Patricia Donahue said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson hired four boys in Bangkok and Pattaya, Thailand, to perform sexual 
acts. He is scheduled to be sentenced May 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies searched Nelson's home June 2, 1992, and found photographs 
of Nelson with the boys, and other child pornography. At the time, Nelson was 
working at Camp Scudder, a juvenile probation camp in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson fled before he could be charged. He was arrested last month in Joplin, 
Mo., on a warrant issued on a 29-count federal indictment for child 
pornography.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; COUNCIL OKS PLAN TO MOVE, WIDEN ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council disappointed a packed audience at City Hall by endorsing a 
plan to move Rancho Viejo Road east and widen it to four lanes, affecting 
several landowners and a Montessori school. 
</P>
<P>
 After four hours of debate, the council voted 3 to 1 Tuesday night to support 
the project, which is needed for the Interstate 5 interchange and the future 
$850-million San Joaquin Hills tollway. Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer was 
absent. The dissenting vote came from Councilman Jeff Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Carolyn Nash called her decision "a very, very difficult vote to 
make," but said there was little the city could do now to change the tollway 
alignment. The approval allows the city to request landscaping for sound walls 
in the project and to get bike and equestrian trails, all paid for by the 
Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies, the tollway's builder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan makes the best of a bad situation," Nash said. "If we didn't 
approve it, we would have lost control of any design elements of that road." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Save Our San Juan, a grass-roots community group, has 
fervently fought the plan, claiming it will destroy the tranquillity of the 
rural neighborhoods on the east side of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The SOS group, which has more than 100 members -- mostly residents of the 
Village San Juan, Country Hills, Mission Hills and Spotted Bull neighborhoods 
-- has lobbied unsuccessfully to have the interchange moved north on Interstate 
5 toward Crown Valley Parkway and away from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the group asked the council to reject the plan for Rancho Viejo 
Road and help it get a new environmental impact report from the TCA. But most 
of the SOS members left the meeting unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous amount of frustration," said Bob Spence, a teacher who 
is a six-year resident in the Mission Hills community. "I'm sure we're not done 
with this, but I don't know what our next step is. . . . We feel like the 
council is not there to serve the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Spence said new environmental documents should be produced because the TCA has 
changed the plan in the area so many times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally they said they were going to move the road 70 feet (toward our 
homes) and now it's 190 feet," Spence said. "They are going to absolutely 
destroy 34 homes in our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gil Jones said city staff will watch the process carefully, 
particularly during the permit stage, to see if the TCA exceeds its original 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we did the best we could to get the best for the city at this point," 
Jones said. "Legally, we can't challenge the EIR at this point. But if the city 
staff determines that the grading exceeds what the original plan shows, then 
we'll have a leg to stand on and maybe we can get another impact report." LEN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY TO JOIN PANEL ON EL TORO BASE USE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has voted unanimously to join an advisory panel that will 
recommend future uses of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, which is 
scheduled to close in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ron Bates was designated to represent the city on the executive 
council of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, which was formed in January by 
the County Board of Supervisors in an alliance with Irvine and Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Alice Jempsa was named alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm there to make sure an airport is not totally ruled out as a possible 
future use" of the base, Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive council, which consists of city representatives, other public 
agencies and private groups, can make recommendations but not decisions on 
redeveloping the 4,700-acre base. 
</P>
<P>
 A nine-member board of directors, made up of the five county supervisors, 
three Irvine City Council members and a Lake Forest council member, has the 
authority to draft the redevelopment plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos is also a member of the Orange County Regional Airport Authority, 
a coalition of North County cities that supports the building of an airport on 
the base. Other member cities are Garden Grove, Stanton and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that joining both organizations gives the city more 
opportunity to participate decisions on reuse of the El Toro base. BERT ELJERA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CERRITOS; ABC UNIFIED 
COULD FACE INSOLVENCY, REPORT SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ABC Unified School District could become insolvent within three years 
unless the school board approves a multimillion-dollar budget-cutting plan, 
officials reported this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The gloomy outlook is contained in a three-year financial projection prepared 
for the county education office by top administrators of the Cerritos-area 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
 The administration submitted the report, as required by state law, in apparent 
defiance of the school board majority. The board argued that the district 
should report that it is in good financial shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Top administrators disagreed, however, and said the district's financial 
problems have been exacerbated by a tentative contract agreement with teachers 
that is will go before the board later this month. The contract restores 
smaller class sizes and pay that teachers lost under terms of an earlier 
contract.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; IT'S SHEAR DELIGHT FOR SHEEP, KIDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For sheep wearing thick wool coats, summertime heat is bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Wednesday at the Santa Ana Zoo, five sheep were shorn in anticipation of 
climbing temperatures and peak suntanning season. 
</P>
<P>
 About 800 schoolchildren and adults from throughout the county attended the 
12th annual Sheepshearing Festival and watched as two professional shearers 
helped the animals slip into something more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all naked now," zoo spokeswoman Leslie Perovich said of the sheep. 
"It was like getting a buzz haircut. There's like nothing there." 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration was done in public to show the children how wool is gathered 
and how it is used. 
</P>
<P>
 During the midmorning festival, children also saw wool spun into yarn and yarn 
woven into fabric, Perovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that sheep are shorn about this time each year to ensure that the 
animals remain comfortable; thick wool coats become itchy as well as hot for 
the animals during summer months. JON NALICK

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FUMES 
REPORTED AS CHILD IS TREATED AT COUNTY-USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fumes from a chemical apparently ingested by a child made some emergency room 
workers lightheaded at County-USC Medical Center on Wednesday night and 
prompted a response from a hazardous materials team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initial reports are that it appears that the child has ingested some type of 
chemical, and the chemical was brought into the emergency room with the child," 
said Jim Wells, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was taken to the pediatric emergency room of the Women's Hospital at 
the medical center, Wells said.  
</P>
<P>
 The child was reported in critical condition. The emergency room workers were 
not seriously affected and were reportedly able to continue to care for the 
youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 Fumes emanating from the body of a cancer patient brought to a Riverside 
County hospital recently overcame medical workers, some of whom had to be 
hospitalized. That case is still under investigation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
EX-BUSINESSMAN CONVICTED OF BILKING 1,100 INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury Wednesday convicted a former Torrance businessman of fraud and 
other charges for helping bilk 1,100 investors out of $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors called the Wellington Group scam one of the largest real estate 
investment schemes in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors deliberated more than a month before finding Morris D. English Jr. 
guilty of six counts of mail fraud, eight counts of securities fraud, five 
counts of bankruptcy fraud and one count of criminal contempt. Among the 
victims were Southern California retirees who lost their savings and a former 
actor who lost $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey Isaacs, who prosecuted the case, said English 
hawked real estate investments on his radio show, promising high interest rates 
at low risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Isaacs said, English spent most of the money on himself. He bought a 
limousine, two airplanes, residences in Redondo Beach and Rancho Palos Verdes, 
and cars for his son and girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 English, who was arrested at a South Bay eatery on May 20, 1993, conceivably 
could be sentenced to hundreds of years in prison and ordered to pay millions 
of dollars in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 His sentencing is set for May 23.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; BROTHERS CRAFT A WAY TO 
HELP QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They say necessity is the mother of invention. To Joshua and Andrew Kaye, who 
were trying to kill time in their front yard after the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
boredom was the mother of invention. 
</P>
<P>
 While their parents were sweeping glass out of their Woodland Hills home, the 
brothers ages 7 and 5 hatched an idea that, so far, has raised nearly $4,000 
for the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 With only ingenuity and a couple of boxes of pipe cleaners, the boys have 
created a craze in the philanthropy fashion world. Everybody who's anybody has 
a pipe cleaner bracelet in their accessory wardrobe. Mayor Richard Riordan, 
that trendsetter, bought two. The fuzzy bangles are all the rage in Supervisor 
Ed Edelman's office, with their fashion colors and dollar donation price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys stumbled across their temporary niche in the garage hours after the 
ground shook. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the day of the earthquake and their lives were disrupted. No school, no 
television, no standing in the refrigerator door. The boys were banished to 
their sunny lawn but soon little entrepreneurial bulbs lit over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 First they opened a lemonade stand. Brisk sales, but a little too traditional. 
The lemonade stand closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came an art gallery with works in chalk, colored pencils, paint -- 
anything that had fallen within reach.  
</P>
<P>
 They suffered a little as artists should. And the gallery closed. 
</P>
<P>
 With the next project, a market selling broken shards of dishes, the boys 
discovered the laws of supply and demand. Then, the china shop closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day the boys found some pipe cleaners. Soon child-sized bracelets 
littered their lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, kids on this tree-lined street knew they were among the lucky ones. 
They knew other children were sleeping in parks or in cars. And the 
entrepreneurs turned into philanthropists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my dad and mom I wanted to make bracelets to help the kids in the 
earthquake," Joshua said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bracelet for a buck was the original idea, but the boys took any donations 
people would offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sold a bracelet for a penny 'cause they had lost their house," Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
 "First we started selling them in front of the house," he said of the 
multicolored bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we sat in front of Von's and started selling them," Andrew said. "But we 
got tired of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two months later, the boys have sold bracelets to politicians, sports 
teams, even Dodgers President Peter O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
 They have sent letters to U.S. senators and to President Clinton asking them 
to buy bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen Los Angeles area schools are participating in the program after being 
instructed by the young brothers in the art of braceleting. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua and Andrew's father, Alan Kaye, estimates the project, now dubbed Kids 
Helping Kids, will bring in $10,000 once all the schools finish their sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just such a wonderful gesture," said Bonnie Bishop-Moren, Andrew's 
principal at Woodland Hills Elementary School. "The little thing they started 
turned into a pretty big thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very creative and very ingenious," said Red Cross spokeswoman Peggy 
Hinz. "It's not a program they started and a few days later tired of. Their 
enthusiasm is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, after two months Joshua is getting a little tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting sort of boring these days. We go to every school and show them 
how to do it," he said. "We sort of need help." 
</P>
<P>
 But Joshua is holding out for one hope -- that Wayne Gretzky, the king of 
Kings, will wear one of his bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that would be cool."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; CITY OKS NEW CLUB, WITH RESERVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A building known to local residents for having a history of troublesome 
restaurants and nightclubs will open as a new club in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council granted a business and entertainment permit to Juan Garcia, 
who plans to open Los Rios Mexican Restaurant and Nightclub in the now-vacant 
building in Cinnamon Square at Ball Road and Juanita Street. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three years ago before the building failed as the Meadowlark 
restaurant, it was known as Promises, a rock 'n' roll nightclub. The club was 
shut down after residents complained of loud noise late at night and customers 
loitering in the parking lot, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Promises, several other restaurants briefly occupied the building, 
which had become known as problems among residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the site's history, council members restricted Los Rios' operating 
hours from 11 a.m. to midnight Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. on 
the weekends and nights before holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Garcia offered to pay the city 35% of the admission he will 
charge customers on nights when the bands play. The charge will be between $10 
and $15, and Garcia said he expects to fill the place with 300 people each 
weekend night. City officials said the restaurant admission tax is the first of 
its kind in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia also will hire two security guards, one for inside and one for outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age said: "I'm nervous about this 
business. It's in an area where we've had problems in the past and given the 
history of that place, we're walking on eggshells." 
</P>
<P>
 A business owner in Cinnamon Square pleaded with the City Council to allow 
Garcia to open his restaurant. "Please give small business a chance," Tim Wang 
said. "Give a small potato something to live on." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members required that the business permit be reviewed in one year. In 
addition, if residents complain about the business, the city may revoke 
Garcia's permit to provide live entertainment.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SUPERVISORS OK WAYS TO DIVERSIFY JURY POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reviewing a report on ways to improve the grand jury recruiting process, 
the Board of Supervisors Tuesday voted unanimously to support five proposed 
methods of widening the panel's candidate pool and clarifying juror 
qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual report, prepared by current grand jurors, provided them with a 
platform to address criticism last year that the grand jury does not reflect 
Orange County's diverse population. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors supported the jurors' recommendations on publicity for their 
recruitment efforts, such as expanding the Grand Jury Outreach Program and 
dubbing November "Grand Jury Awareness Month." 
</P>
<P>
 The board also endorsed several methods of eliminating conflict of interest 
concerns, such as having the county marshal's department, instead of the 
district attorney's office, conduct background checks. That change, the report 
noted, would prevent prosecutors, who present cases to the jury, from having 
any effect on the panel's makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 A third recommendation, authorizing the jury commissioner and the marshal's 
department to draw up guidelines for background checks, was also intended to 
clarify qualifications for sitting on the grand jury. The board endorsed the 
suggestion, which was put into effect in the months since it was tentatively 
suggested last September. 
</P>
<P>
 The board rejected two juror recommendations that officials said would 
conflict with state statutes or case law. Those suggestions -- standardizing 
the guidelines used to narrow the field of juror candidates and scrapping the 
home-visit portion of the background check -- were "inconsistent with 
applicable law," the board said in its response. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury serves as the county's government watchdog and decides whether 
criminal charges should be filed in some cases that the district attorney's 
office brings to the panel. Jurors serve a one-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must be U.S. citizens and older than 18. The deadline for 
applications for the 1995-96 panel has passed, but people interested in serving 
on the grand jury can have their names placed on a mailing list for future 
panels by calling (714) 834-6747. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BUDGET DIRECTOR TO JOIN CONSULTING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Budget Director Ronald S. Rubino, who has worked in county 
government for 20 years and managed the budget during one of the most difficult 
economic times for local government, has resigned to take a position with a 
local financial consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubino, 42, said Wednesday that he will remain with the county for another 
month while a successor is chosen for the post, which pays $99,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call me a masochist, but I've enjoyed it," Rubino said. "This was a very, 
very hard decision for me to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubino will join Leifer Capital, a firm that provides consulting and 
coordinates revenue bond sales for cities and counties in California. In his 
new position, Rubino is not permitted to lobby or seek new business with county 
government for at least a year, according to the county's ethics code. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have really loved working in government finance, and this will allow me to 
continue that in the private sector," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubino managed the county's $3.5-billion budget during a statewide economic 
decline that brought rising unemployment and dramatic downturns in local 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I think we are in better shape than we have been in the past four 
years," Rubino said. "If the state would just leave us alone, we should be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, state government also has taken larger shares of 
property-tax revenues from local governments to pay for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Before taking over the budget office four years ago, Rubino worked for eight 
years in the county auditor-controller's office and eight years for the county 
General Services Agency. KEVIN JOHNSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizen hot line created to field suggestions about how Orange County 
government could be more efficient has run cold less than a year in 
operation.Since June, only 50 calls have been recorded, prompting Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley to ask that the service be discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not feel it appropriate to continue a service which is not being 
utilized by the residents of Orange County," Riley said in a memo to County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider. "Therefore, I request the cancellation 
of the . . . line immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said that most of the calls were received in the first month of 
operation. KEVIN JOHNSON

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
FIRED DEPUTY GETS OK TO FIGHT REINSTATEMENT REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sheriff's deputy fired for killing an unarmed 15-year-old car theft suspect 
in 1991 will get a chance March 25 to fight a move to block his return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien on Wednesday set the hearing 
date for Jose Belmares, who wants to stop the county from convening a second 
session to determine if his reinstatement should be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmares contends it would amount to double jeopardy if a second hearing is 
held to determine if he was acting according to policy when he shot David Angel 
Ortiz after an early morning chase on Aug. 28, 1991. The Montebello youth was a 
suspected car thief and gang member who fled on foot from Belmares and his 
partner, Robert Orona, after the chase ended in a cul-de-sac in Artesia.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department fired Belmares. But in an administrative appeal, a 
civil service officer found that the shooting was within policy and that 
Belmares should be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission voted 3 to 2 to reinstate him. 
But at the urging of attorney Miguel Garcia, who represents the Ortiz family, 
the commission reversed its decision in December and ordered another hearing. 
It is set for May 2 unless O'Brien agrees to stop it, Belmares' attorney 
Elizabeth Gibbons said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
CHILD-SUPPORT COLLECTION PROGRAM NETS $5.6 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new program to collect delinquent child support payments has pulled in $5.1 
million in Los Angeles County, and $5.6 million overall, after three months, 
according to figures released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Franchise Tax Board's Child Support Collection Program is on its way to 
reaching its first-year goal of collecting $14 million in delinquent child 
support payments statewide, State Controller Gray Davis said.The program 
collected the $5.6 million between Dec. 1 and Feb. 28, Davis said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This program is surpassing all expectations," Davis said. "The results have 
been extraordinary. Deadbeat parents who owe child support are being forced to 
live up to their responsibilities, and thousands of California children are 
living better."  
</P>
<P>
 The board more than doubled its child support collections in February, 
compared with the two previous months, by sending out levies to attach wages 
and bank accounts. The program collected $1.8 million from December to January 
by sending out payment notices alone, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a two-year pilot project involving six counties, including Los 
Angeles, Santa Clara and Ventura. Prosecutors in the counties can send a 
combined total of 200,000 cases at a time to the FTB. The board acts as a 
"collector of last resort," accepting only cases that are more than 30 days in 
arrears, Davis said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; MTA 
TO PRESENT PLAN FOR BALANCING BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a projected $300-million shortfall for the next fiscal year, a 
transit agency committee voted Wednesday to give the federal government a plan 
on how the agency hopes to get out of its budget hole. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal gained urgency when a representative from the Southern California 
Assn. of Governments told the panel members that the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority's deficit puts federal transit financing for the 
entire region in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Association official Eric Roth told the committee that Los Angeles County is 
the only county in the area with a transit agency operating in the red. The MTA 
has a $126-million gap between operating expenses and revenue, and an 
additional $170-million shortfall in capital improvement funds. SCAG has been 
charged by the Federal Transit Agency to submit an overall transit plan for the 
Southland.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; MAN'S QUICK WORK SAVES NEIGHBOR HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fresh resident of Agate Canyon Drive, Gabor Zolna is just starting to form 
the daily routines that go with living in a new neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, shortly after 7 a.m. Wednesday, Zolna was returning home from his 
daily walk with Baron Von Hooter, a Boston terrier, when he spotted a thick, 
black cloud of smoke billowing from a neighbor's garage. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the fire engines arrived, Zolna had already extinguished the 
flames using a fire extinguisher and a garden hose. Orange County Fire 
Department officials are crediting him with saving the entire house. 
</P>
<P>
 "By acting so quickly, he was able to keep the flames in check and protect the 
rest of the property," said Maria Sabol, a department spokeswoman. "I think Mr. 
Zolna is the kind of person you'd want to have around the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Zolna doesn't see his actions as any big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just there at the right place and time," said Zolna, 50, who moved to 
Agate Canyon Drive from Mission Viejo last month.  
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials have ruled the fire accidental, saying it was probably caused 
by an iron. Homeowner Claudia Julian told firemen that she was pressing clothes 
in the garage and turned off the iron when she smelled an acrid odor wafting 
from the small appliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the woman noticed smoke coming from the door connecting the garage to 
the house. When she saw the flames, Julian pressed her garage door opener and 
shut the door leading to the house interior. 
</P>
<P>
 After Zolna spotted the smoke, he went home, grabbed a fire extinguisher and 
ran back to Julian's house, about four doors away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flames were burning a wall for about eight feet from floor to ceiling," 
he said. "I hit it with the fire extinguisher until it ran out of chemicals, 
then I grabbed a hose and sprayed water until (the fire) went out." 
</P>
<P>
 Zolna said he spent more time reacting than thinking. But he remembers being 
nervous about the possibility of the fire reaching the gas tank of a Ford 
Bronco parked in the garage. Also nearby was a two-gallon gas tank filled with 
fuel for a power lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned about the Bronco igniting," he said. "Otherwise, it was all 
adrenaline." 
</P>
<P>
 The damage to the house was estimated at $600 by fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it could have been a lot worse if Mr. Zolna hadn't acted so 
quickly," Sabol said. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; STUDENTS TEST THEIR QUAKE READINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Taylor, 17, his head bandaged and with fake blood drying on his arms, 
watched fellow students rushing to provide medical aid to him and other 
"victims" in the aftermath of a staged earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 As nearby teams of Red Cross-trained students applied bandages to the wounded 
and soothed the hysterical, Kevin said he believed the drill would prepare his 
classmates at Santa Ana High School well for a real emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will help a lot. They'll know what to do and they won't have to 
think about it when (a disaster) happens. It makes me feel real good to know 
that if a disaster happens, there will be someone here to take care of me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong drill on Wednesday simulated the potentially deadly aftermath of 
a 5.9-quake along the Newport-Inglewood fault line. School officials said it 
provided a realistic setting in which students, faculty and staff could 
practice disaster response. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the event, about 45 specially trained students helped coordinate 
disaster response, damage assessment of buildings and treatment of wounded just 
as they would during a real emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the students trained through the Red Cross Youth in Emergency 
Services program, the drill was the first chance to apply skills learned in 
disaster-preparedness classes, said Peggy-Sue Ellis, who coordinates the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said that students "go out there and live it a little bit, so they can 
say later, 'Wow, I was able to handle that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During a real emergency, trained students are an ideal source of help in 
providing immediate first aid, damage assessment and other crucial services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross has trained about 1,700 students countywide over the last three 
years for similar emergencies and more than 300 of them helped out as 
translators and shelter workers in Los Angeles and Orange counties during last 
fall's firestorms and the recent Northridge earthquake. Red Cross officials 
hope to train students at all public high schools countywide by the end of the 
year, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the drill began, some of the students lined up outside their classrooms and 
walked to open playing fields. Dozens of students remained inside the rooms, 
portraying injury victims. Many of the rooms were marked with signs describing 
the kind of damage they had sustained, such as collapsed ceilings, broken 
windows and cracked support beams. 
</P>
<P>
 At the medical aid center, Martha Sarabia, 18, acted the part of a hysterical 
student and screamed repeatedly until others came to calm her. She said that 
lying there made her think about what it would be like to be helpless during a 
real emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveying a room filled with moaning students with arms in splints, she added, 
"I take it more seriously than before." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; STADIUMS TEAM UP TO DEAL WITH DRUNKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't long ago that stadiums and arenas across the country tolerated drunk 
spectators as the price to be paid if they were to sell large quantities of 
highly profitable beer. 
</P>
<P>
 But no more. Sports marketing today is aimed at families who may not come back 
if exposed to loud, rude or drunk fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to learn Techniques Effective in Alcohol Management (TEAM), 
representatives from stadiums and arenas across the United States and Canada 
have been meeting at the Anaheim Arena this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The program -- sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation, all four 
major professional sports leagues, the CBS television network, stadium trade 
groups and Mothers Against Drunk Driving -- teaches stadium personnel how to 
deal with fans who have had too much to drink. Organizers hope that stadium 
managers at the seminar will return home and teach the program to their 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wants to go to a place where you have to hear foul language and have beer 
spilled on you?" asked seminar organizer Michael T. Impellizzeri of the 
Department of Transportation. "If you bring your family to an event, you don't 
want to expose your kids to conduct that is opposed to your ideals." 
</P>
<P>
 TEAM began in 1985 after polls of the public and season-ticket holders showed 
that the top complaint about attending sports events was the exposure to drunk 
and unruly fans, Impellizzeri said. 
</P>
<P>
 "TEAM is unique in that it brings together all of the employees at an arena or 
stadium," he said. The program wants to teach all employees how to spot a 
drunk, deal with them in a courteous but firm manner and assure them that 
management will support them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It starts in the parking lot, through the ticket sellers, the concessionaires 
and the ushers, Impellizzeri said. "They are all lines of defense" in 
preventing drunkenness and are "important in ensuring that everyone will have a 
good time at the facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of TEAM's concepts are already in place at the Anaheim Arena, spokesman 
John Nicoletti said. At some events, such as high school basketball games, no 
alcohol is sold. During Mighty Ducks hockey games, beer sales are stopped 
midway through the third period, and obvious drunks are cut off immediately, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the image of hockey fans is that they are rowdy, but we have a 
different class of fan here," Nicoletti said. "We have a lot more families, and 
it is very important for us to maintain an atmosphere that they enjoy." TERRY 
SPENCER

MENENDEZ LAWYER TO STAY FOR 2ND TRIAL; COURTS: LESLIE ABRAMSON PLANS TO 
CONTINUE SEEKING COUNTY FUNDS TO REPRESENT THE YOUNGER BROTHER, EVEN THOUGH 
JUDGE HAS DENIED REQUEST. SHE CALLS HER SITUATION SERFDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although it's uncertain whether she will work for free or for a taxpayer-paid 
fee, defense lawyer Leslie Abramson told a judge Wednesday that she plans to 
return for a second trial in the Menendez brothers murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do expect to be here, your honor, for the duration," Abramson, who 
represents younger brother Erik Menendez, told Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Stanley M. Weisberg during a brief hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Cecil Mills, the supervising judge 
of the county's criminal courts, refused to appoint Abramson to defend Menendez 
at taxpayer expense at the second trial -- saying she still has a valid 
contract to represent him in the retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson told Weisberg, who presided over the first trial, that she will 
continue to seek payment by the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, she assessed the situation. "My situation right now is most 
accurately called serf. S-e-r-f," she said. "I have been told that I am to 
provide perpetual care on this case. Lifetime employment. That's where it 
stands right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Menendez, 23, and Lyle Menendez, 26, are charged with murder in the Aug. 
20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty 
Menendez, 47.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that the brothers killed out of hatred and greed for the 
parents' estate, once valued at $14 million. Defense lawyers now say the money 
is virtually depleted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, the brothers admitted the killings but said they lashed 
out in fear after years of abuse. That trial ended in January when separate 
juries, one for each brother, deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Abramson also urged Weisberg to have the brothers tried 
separately. The judge said he was inclined to have the brothers tried together 
again but would consider the request because Lyle Menendez's chief defense 
lawyer at the first trial, Jill Lansing, has left the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The two public defenders assigned to take over the older brother's case told 
Weisberg they were not sure how long it will take to prepare. He scheduled a 
hearing April 15 to set a trial date.

LANGUAGE BARRIER; JARGON-LADEN CITY HALL PARLANCE COULD DRIVE LISTENERS BANANAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A debate over who should manage a quake-debris cleanup program was heating up 
in Los Angeles City Hall recently when Councilman Mike Hernandez stood and 
asked city staff about the participation of "WeeBees" and "MeeBees." 
</P>
<P>
 To City Hall newcomers, it may have sounded as if Hernandez had cracked under 
pressure and begun to speak gibberish. But in fact he was simply using City 
Hall jargon to refer to the Women Business Enterprise and Minority Enterprise 
contractors, who would get work through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The expressions are part of a growing lexicon of acronyms and imaginative 
terms that make up the parlance of City Hall, a language spoken fluently by 
political insiders that is Greek to just about everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, everyday conversation in City Hall has become so full of 
bureaucratese that a council aide has drafted a 20-page dictionary of City Hall 
acronyms to help council newcomers become literate in the lingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Francine Oschin, an aide to San Fernando Valley Councilman Hal Bernson, said 
the idea for the dictionary was born three years ago after she attended a 
meeting of SCAG (the Southern California Assn. of Governments) to discuss ISTEA 
(the federal Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like listening to alphabet soup," she said. "You spent so much time 
trying to figure out what was said in the past two sentences that you lost what 
was being said." 
</P>
<P>
 And new acronyms are coined every day. For example, the engineers who were 
assigned to oversee the quake-debris cleanup program have dubbed themselves the 
Northridge Earthquake Recovery Department, or NERD. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as some languages have regional dialects, almost every city department 
has its own expressions and acronyms. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bureau of Sanitation, trash collectors use the term junkin to refer to 
the act of removing and keeping items discarded with garbage, as in: "He found 
that chair while he was junkin." 
</P>
<P>
 And most trash collectors cringe when they are called out to a DAC, a Dead 
Animal Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Street Maintenance Department, a skin patch is a thin layer of asphalt 
used to repair a pothole and a dog wagon is a trailer used to carry tools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some zoning officials use the acronym BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing 
Anywhere Near Anything) to poke fun at homeowners who oppose development. On 
the other hand, a project opposed by neighbors can be called a LULU (Locally 
Unwanted Land Use). 
</P>
<P>
 Planning officials often toss around terms such as NegDec to refer to a 
negative declaration -- a decision that a development project will have no 
significant environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
 And they say that before the city approves a controversial project, it must be 
considered by PLUM, the council's committee on Planning and Land Use 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Many community activists see the increasing use of such government jargon as 
part of the reason the public is sometimes reluctant to participate in local 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jargon is intimidating," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman 
Oaks Homeowners Assn. "The uninitiated (go) to a public hearing and they don't 
know what is going on, but a lawmaker or a lobbyist knows what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Close, who has been active in civic affairs for nearly 20 years 
and has become well versed in the jargon, said the language can be learned 
relatively quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Other homeowner representatives simply shrug at the use of bureaucratic 
jargon, accepting it as an inherent part of local government. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to be active in civic affairs, you have to deal with it," 
said Barbara Fine, vice president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns., which represents home and property owners on both sides of the Santa 
Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 One San Fernando Valley homeowner protested to a City Council planning 
committee in January about the use of confusing "legalese" in newspaper 
notifications issued by the city to tell residents of neighborhood land-use 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Hall insiders say they are trying to cut down on jargon. "When you 
start sounding like a bureaucrat, you lose that connection" with the public, 
said Greg Nelson, an aide to Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
 About five years ago, then-council member Gloria Molina became so upset over 
the use of bureaucratic gibberish that she suggested an ordinance to require 
the use of more simple language in official documents. She was told that such 
an ordinance already existed but was generally ignored because no one 
understood it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within the council chambers, the city's lawmakers bat around many 
official-sounding terms and expressions that actually have simple, 
down-to-earth definitions. For example, to receive and file a report simply 
means to put it away. When a council member says, "I move the previous 
question," it means, "Let's stop talking and vote." 
</P>
<P>
 After an ordinance is adopted, the council president sometimes says, 
"Forthwith on that," which simply tells the city clerk to hurry the item to the 
mayor for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the city's lower-level managers use the term Emerald City to refer to 
the second and third floors of City Hall, where offices for the mayor and 
council members are located. And when they are called to testify before the 
council, they say they are being called to the horseshoe, because the council 
members' desks are arranged in a horseshoe shape around the speaker. 
Translating City Hall Here are some commonly used acronyms and expressions at 
Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * BANANA: Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: In private by planning officials and council members when they 
run across residents who oppose even the most innocuous project. "How could 
they oppose that project? They must be BANANAs." 
</P>
<P>
 * CUP: Conditional Use Permit, usually required of controversial projects. 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: Planning, zoning and council members use this acronym routinely 
at public hearings. "Without a CUP, that project is dead in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 * Emerald City: Second and third floors of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: This is a pejorative term used among lower-level managers to 
poke fun at the council members and mayor who work on those two floors. "Get a 
load of him. He's wearing his best suit for a meeting in Emerald City." 
</P>
<P>
 * The horseshoe: The U-shaped configuration of desks where council members sit 
during meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: By regulars at council meetings. "Have you heard the latest 
rumors around the horseshoe?" 
</P>
<P>
 * LULU: Locally Unwanted Land Use. 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: By planning officials and others to describe a project opposed 
by nearby residents. "Is that project going to be approved or is it a LULU?" 
</P>
<P>
 * NIMBY: Not In My Back Yard 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: To describe people opposed to a project because it is nearby. 
"You can expect opposition from that group. They're NIMBYs." 
</P>
<P>
 * REAP: Rent Escrow Account Program. The city puts rents from dilapidated 
apartment buildings into an account until the owner makes repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 How it's used: Often by zoning administrators. "Let's put that building into 
REAP and hope the landlord shapes up."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SCHOOL DISTRICT SEEKS ANTI-VIOLENCE GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District has applied for a grant to help middle 
school teachers prevent student violence on campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The district would use the $4,000 grant to train teachers in various 
conflict-resolution techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Some middle school teachers already receive basic training on ways to defuse 
fights among students and help them communicate constructively. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would take us to a higher level of violence prevention," said Nancy 
Colocino, the district's coordinator for guidance counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, from the National Foundation for the Improvement of Education, 
would pay for training on cultural differences and how they affect disputes 
among students, Colocino said. Teachers would also receive training on how to 
negotiate with students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district should know whether it would receive the grant later this year.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COLLEGE WILL NAME BUILDING FOR CHAVEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rancho Santiago College Board of Trustees has decided to name a business 
and computer building planned for its Santa Ana campus after civil rights 
leader Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 The board made the unanimous decision at its regular meeting Monday.About a 
dozen students and community members, many of whom had tearfully urged the 
board to honor Chavez, broke into applause after the choice gained approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nonviolent place where we change lives, where anyone of any 
nationality can become anything they want to be," said Trustee Charles W. 
(Pete) Maddox before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a message that comes out of this building being named for Cesar 
Chavez, I hope it's the message of nonviolence and that there's hope on this 
campus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Vivian Blevins told the board that the exact name of the building 
would be chosen later, adding that it probably would be something close to 
"Cesar Chavez Business and Computer Building." Construction of the $12-million 
building is expected to begin in June and be completed by early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, who championed nonviolent protest, is best known for his orchestration 
of the massive grape boycotts of the 1960s to dramatize the plight of migrant 
farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great man. He should be recognized," said Russ Jobin, a member of 
the United Farm Workers who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hailing the decision, Jobin said Chavez would be an inspiration to students: 
"He accomplished things very simply. He just used words." JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; $50,000 GRANT WON BY HOUSING PROVIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nonprofit group devoted to providing low-cost housing for the poor has won a 
$50,000 grant to aid in its work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana-based Civic Center Barrio Corp. was awarded the grant last week 
by Great Western Bank, a bank spokesman said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited about it," said Helen R. Brown, Civic Center Barrio Corp. 
executive director. "The award is a strong endorsement from the housing and 
financial industries that our program is making a contribution that is both 
positive and significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the money would help fund a child care center at the organization's 
Park Village Apartments on 3rd Street. Construction on the center, which will 
accommodate 32 children, is expected to be completed in May.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; SHARING A BEAR HUG WITH THE ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A warm cuddly hug may be the best medicine to cheer up senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us need to have personal contact -- hugging, touching and love from 
someone," said Glinda Muirhead, community relations manager for senior mental 
health services at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 To lift seniors' spirits and brighten their day, the hospital has started "Hug 
Day" visits by Cuddles, a six-foot brown bear with a big red heart on her 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing at the reaction when that bear goes into a room where a person 
is lying in bed depressed, feeling like they're abandoned in this world," 
Muirhead said. "When a bear gives a hug and a big old smoochy kiss, you see the 
biggest smiles. . . . It brings joy to someone's life, a feeling that someone 
does care about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Paul H. Kosieradzki, a psychiatrist who specializes in treating the 
elderly and medical director of the hospital's senior mental health program, 
agreed that older folks can benefit from "hug therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 "They get an immediate response and gratification," the doctor said. "They're 
happy, they smile, it's almost like they're little kids again; they're grown up 
children who need affection too."  
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, Kosieradzki said, there are no side effects -- only a dose of 
good cheer to make them feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 Kosieradzki said hug therapy is one part of the intervention strategy, which 
also includes improving socialization among peers and recreational therapy, so 
seniors can adjust to changes in their lives and have a better lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Many elderly patients suffer from depression because of the losses of their 
health and loved ones, and, for some, the inability to no longer care for 
themselves, Muirhead said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many have gotten to stages in their life and cannot live alone. It's hard for 
them to adjust to not being able to live independently," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Lindberg, 32, who wears the Cuddles costume, is founder of Hugs for Health 
Foundation of Orange, which provides the Hug Day program for residents of 
convalescent homes and long-term care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg said the visits increase seniors' sense of self-worth and add to the 
quality of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spend a lifetime giving to their families and communities," she said. 
"This gives us an opportunity to give back to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Her foundation also has a "Hugs Squad" program, in which volunteers visit 
residents in care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg said seniors often tell her that they needed a hug or that the hug 
made their day. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing more rewarding than putting smiles on faces and knowing that 
what you've done has made a difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the hugs volunteer program, call (714) 832-4847.

RESEARCH ON THE ROAD; STUDENTS FROM QUAKE-DAMAGED NORTHRIDGE CAMPUS ENDURE THE 
LONG TREK TO UCLA LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing Zepur Jakmakian wanted was a quick trip to the library to start 
researching a paper for her biology class at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, that would have meant a 10-minute walk across campus. This week, it 
turned into a 3 1/2-hour ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it may take a year to reopen the campus's only library after damage 
from the Jan. 17 earthquake, officials have had to arrange alternative service 
at UCLA. They have set up a free shuttle service to ferry students to the 
Westwood campus's 13 libraries, hourly from morning to night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jakmakian, a 22-year-old biology major, made the 40-minute trip to UCLA 
earlier this week, only to discover she had left her books behind. That meant a 
bus trip back to Northridge, and then another back to UCLA, getting caught in 
rush-hour traffic on the way. Net time to arrive: 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most students making the UCLA journeys praised Northridge officials 
for establishing the alternative library service, many also are finding that 
the new arrangement has its limitations, and certainly is unforgiving of 
mistakes such as Jakmakian's. Some also are discovering a new sense of what 
they have lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to complain about it all the time, but now we really miss it," 
Jakmakian said of the Delmar T. Oviatt Library. The 220,000-square-foot 
centerpiece of the campus, also the largest library in the San Fernando Valley, 
was one of the university buildings most damaged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, the 13 UCLA libraries house more than 6 million volumes, 
compared to the 1.1 million volumes in Northridge's single library. And some 
students said they enjoy leaving the disarray of their campus for UCLA's 
tranquil grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the downside, others reported difficulties finding materials in UCLA's 
vast library system, much less navigating their way around an unfamiliar 
campus. And given the travel time from Northridge, gone are impromptu library 
trips during one-hour class breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty hard. We've got to go to different libraries for different 
sources," said Kiet Tom, a 19-year-old history major who said his classmates 
have found UCLA very confusing. "We don't have big giant libraries like at 
UCLA," Tom said of the Northridge campus.  
</P>
<P>
 Last semester, Tom said, he was constantly at the Oviatt library during the 
week but was able to go home on weekends to relax with his family near 
Chinatown. Now, he's going to UCLA about twice a week but having to spend all 
his Saturdays and Sundays studying at the Downtown Los Angeles Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Liliana Vega, a junior majoring in psychology and child development, made her 
first bus trip to UCLA this week, saying, "I have to look for psychology 
journals, but I don't know where to go." Fortunately, she got a guided tour 
from one of the Northridge librarians who have been sent to help at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega had previously tried the library at Mission College near her home in 
Sylmar, but did not find what she needed. Her plight pointed out an additional 
complication for students: The earthquake also has closed many other libraries 
in the area, and the remaining ones are not of university caliber. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge officials are working on two temporary library operations on 
campus, but they will be mostly electronic when they open, in several weeks at 
the earliest. There are no plans to remove most of the books from the Oviatt 
library, so the UCLA operation will continue at least through the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 However, UCLA and Cal State Northridge officials said an agreement has already 
been signed that will give Northridge students and faculty on-line access to 
UCLA's library catalogue at the two temporary sites. They also will be able, 
for a fee, to order materials from UCLA that will be delivered by the buses. 
</P>
<P>
 One satisfied customer was Mandana Dehdashti, a 23-year-old medical technology 
major and self-described "library person" who came to UCLA just to find a quiet 
place to study. Dehdashti said she even studied on the bus and used UCLA's 
shuttles to get around the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was better than staying at CSUN trying to study in the cafeteria. You 
can't find a place to sit," she said. "Actually, I'd prefer if the Oviatt was 
open. But since it's not, this is the best they can do," she said.

MANISCALCO'S LAWYERS WILL SEEK NEW TRIAL; COURTS: SECOND-DEGREE MURDER 
CONVICTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN 'COERCED,' THEY SAY, AND DO NOT MATCH THE EVIDENCE IN 
THE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense attorneys for Thomas F. Maniscalco -- convicted of second-degree 
murder in a dramatic end to the county's longest criminal case -- said 
Wednesday that they will seek a new trial on grounds that the verdicts may have 
been "coerced" and did not match the evidence in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary will hear a motion for 
a new trial on May 20, when she is scheduled to sentence Maniscalco. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco, an attorney and co-founder of the Hessians biker gang, was 
convicted Tuesday of ordering the executions of another biker and the biker's 
bodyguard and girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys say the evidence centered on prosecution witnesses who 
depicted Maniscalco as central to a conspiracy that led to the brutal slayings 
on Memorial Day, 1980 -- allegations more fitted to first-degree murder.  
</P>
<P>
 First-degree murder is premeditated and carries a heavier sentence. Maniscalco 
faces 16 years to life in prison for each of his three second-degree murder 
convictions. First-degree convictions would have required a sentence of 26 
years to life in prison for each count. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just concerned how it is that one legally can rationalize a 
second-degree verdict with the evidence this jury heard," defense attorney Curt 
Livesay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our case was presented, argued and tried on the theory of, 'Don't believe 
these (witnesses). They're lying to save their skins.' Our view was, 'Believe 
it or don't believe it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King said Wednesday that the defense never objected to 
jury instructions that included second-degree convictions as an option. 
</P>
<P>
 "These verdicts are within the realm of the evidence, otherwise they wouldn't 
have been instructed," King said. "That's what we have the jury for. They did 
not see it as first-degree. They did not see it as acquittal. But we've had 12 
citizens in this case feel that he is guilty of murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Livesay said he and co-counsel Joanne Harrold would be "reviewing the jury 
instructions in minute detail" and interviewing jurors to determine whether the 
verdicts were "coerced." 
</P>
<P>
 Before reaching a verdict, jurors deliberated for 24 days -- two days short of 
the deliberation record set in 1990 in Maniscalco's first trial, which ended in 
a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution alleged that Maniscalco ordered the deaths of biker Richard 
(Rabbit) Rizzone, 36; Rizzone's bodyguard, Thomas Monahan, 28, and Rizzone's 
girlfriend, Rena Miley, 19. They were shot repeatedly in Rizzone's Westminster 
home. Miley, the daughter of a now-retired Los Alamitos police officer, was 
also raped. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Maniscalco ordered Rizzone killed because he suspected 
Rizzone was skimming proceeds from the gang's alleged drug and counterfeiting 
business. Monahan and Miley were killed to eliminate witnesses, prosecutors 
believed.

JOB-SKILLS PROGRAM IS WORKING FOR HIM, AND VICE VERSA; EMPLOYMENT: ONE-YEAR 
STINT IN CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS TURNED HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT'S LIFE 
AROUND, HE TELLS GROUP OF YOUNG ADULTS AT RECRUITMENT SEMINAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A year ago, Edgar Sanchez says, he was a gang-banging, drug-using high school 
dropout. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when he decided to apply for the California Conservation Corps, a 
statewide yearlong program that teaches 18- to 23-year-olds home fix-up skills 
that they can use later to repair dilapidated housing in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, dressed in a brown khaki uniform and black steel-toed boots, 
Sanchez told a group of young adults attending a CCC recruitment seminar how 
the program taught him valuable job skills and put him on the threshold of 
earning his General Equivalency Degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sick and tired of running the streets, I wanted to make a change," he 
told the group. "Because you are here today means you also want to make a 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar was held at Santa Ana's Southwest Senior Center and was part of an 
effort to get young adults from crime-troubled neighborhoods into programs that 
teach them job skills. The meeting drew 14 applicants, most of whom said they 
had not finished high school and were looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jerson Tobar, 18, the chance to earn a GED and work regularly drew him to 
the seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked as a painter, but there was never enough work," he said. "When I 
heard about this, I had to come down and see what it was about. I would like to 
work for the gas company."  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, CCC recruiters, including Sanchez, visited a neighborhood bordered 
by 1st Street and McFadden Avenue to the north and south, and Raitt and 
Sullivan streets to the east and west, passing out information on the program 
and the upcoming seminar to young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructors from Southern California Gas Co. teach sections of the program on 
home weatherization. Other organizations helping with instruction include the 
Carpenters Union, Santa Ana's Community Redevelopment Agency, and the Central 
County Regional Occupation Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must be Santa Ana residents, ages 18 to 23, and cannot be on 
probation or parole. After they fill out an application and take a physical, 
they are given an educational assessment to determine their academic needs. 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks of orientation, trainees then commute to work sites throughout 
the city to spend eight-hour days learning housing-rehabilitation skills. They 
also learn park maintenance, tree planting and landscaping and graffiti 
removal. Starting pay is minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Corps members are also required to attend evening classes where they work on 
writing, reading, computer use and English, if Spanish is their native 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardo E. Garcia, the San Gabriel Valley and Orange County district director 
of the California Conservation Corps, said the program, now in its 11th year 
statewide, also attempts to teach young adults social skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concept is team teaching," he said. "We don't just teach job skills but 
try to encourage interaction between workers, which is how the real workplace 
operates."  
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez has worked his way up to becoming a regional crew leader supervising 
about 15 trainees since he began last April. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program has given me self-respect and direction," said Sanchez, who said 
he hopes to major in criminology and become a police officer after he finishes 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, I never pictured myself helping the community."

EX-COUNCILMAN ACOSTA JOINING SANTA ANA RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Acosta, a former vice mayor who served on the Santa Ana City Council for 
12 years, declared his candidacy for a council seat on Wednesday, vowing to run 
on a "business-friendly" ticket with mayoral hopeful Randell Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta, 59, a mason, and Young, 39, a restaurateur and blues guitarist, have 
dubbed their ticket PEACE Corps, an acronym for Providing Economic Alternatives 
to Criminal Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had earlier put out the call for three other like-minded candidates to 
run with him as a slate in November, raising the prospect of a new majority on 
the seven-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read that he declared and I read his platform and what he stood for, I 
got so motivated," Acosta said of Young. "I said, 'This is what I always wanted 
when I was on the council, but I couldn't get majority council support.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta said stringent city parking standards and sign requirements are some of 
the burdens small businesses face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take the muzzle off that small-business owner who wants to open a business, 
and the whole free enterprise system will work," he said, adding that those 
businesses would then hire youths who would otherwise turn to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta served on the council for 12 years and had to step down in November, 
1992, because of term limits. He ran unsuccessfully in that election for the 
mayor's seat, which is not subject to limits. 
</P>
<P>
 During his years as a city official, he said, he saw the city become "cold and 
indifferent" to constituent needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city needs more Spanish-speaking staff, and needs to more seriously 
address the issue of the skyrocketing homicide rate, he said. An exodus of car 
dealerships from the city while he was on the council also indicated that the 
city was not doing enough to keep business happy, Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta said he is hopeful that two more candidates will come forward to run 
with him and Young. 
</P>
<P>
 One question remains, however: where Acosta will run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to run in the ward that fills the need. I'll evaluate where I would 
best fit, relocate to that ward and change my registration to that address," he 
said. "I'm single. I can move anywhere I want." 
</P>
<P>
 Young also must move back to Santa Ana from San Clemente to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activist John Raya, 40, declared his candidacy for mayor earlier 
this month on a pro-business platform that encourages education and assistance 
to the city's youth.

NO ONE DARES CHALLENGE BERGESON FOR SUPERVISOR SEAT; ELECTION: THE STATE 
SENATOR WILL RUN UNFETTERED JUNE 7 AS FILING DEADLINE PASSES WITH NO 
OPPOSITION. INCUMBENT RILEY SAYS IT'S A SIGN OF HER CLOUT.

 More than two months before the June 7 election, state Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach) effectively won her bid to succeed retiring County Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley when Wednesday's filing deadline passed leaving her without an 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased not to have opposition, but we will still be continuing our 
campaign," Bergeson said. "We have scheduled (campaign) appointments into the 
spring, and I intend to keep them." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of opposition, Riley said, should be taken as a measure of Bergeson's 
local popularity and political strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Bergeson announced her candidacy last year, Riley said seven South 
County officials had talked to him about running for his 5th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Marian entered the race, they didn't follow up," said Riley, who will 
retire in January after 20 years as the Board of Supervisors South County 
representative. "It makes me feel real good. I know the district will gain by 
having her there. She is a person committed to good government." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most imposing about Bergeson's candidacy was her choice of campaign 
leadership, a team that included the immensely popular Riley, a former Marine 
Corps general, and former baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, who lives 
in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 During her 15 years in Sacramento, first as an assemblywoman and then as a 
senator, the former Newport-Mesa Unified School District board member has been 
credited with defending a conservative philosophy that marks local government 
and politics in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 In the only other county race with a Wednesday filing deadline, Huntington 
Beach businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson was the last to formally qualify for a 
place on the June ballot for a seat to be vacated by retiring County Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson was the only addition to a field of five other candidates looking to 
win election to Wieder's 2nd District seat. The other candidates are Huntington 
Beach council members Linda Moulton-Patterson and Jim Silva, John A. Thomas and 
Steven E. Malone of Huntington Beach and Raymond Thomas Littrell of Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for the two supervisorial seats were given a three-day extension to 
file candidacy papers since Riley and Wieder are not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dana Point, the only city holding a council election in June, the municipal 
race has attracted the largest field of candidates since 1988 and is expected 
to be a political free-for-all, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With three open council seats in which two of the incumbents will not seek 
reelection, 13 residents filed candidate forms by Wednesday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The only incumbent who has chosen to seek reelection is Councilwoman Karen 
Lloreda. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be bloody," said Councilman Mike Eggers, one of the two not 
seeking reelection. "This election will make the incorporation battle between 
Laguna Niguel and Dana Point look like a church social. I'm looking forward to 
watching it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eggers said each candidate "will try to stake out their own issue" and turn 
each candidate forum into "a three-ring circus." 
</P>
<P>
 "You will hear so many solutions to issues it will look like a White House 
initiative," said Eggers, an aide to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Eileen Krause, the other incumbent who decided not to run, said 
she was excited to see so many candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I can tell, we are really going to have some qualified people 
running," Krause said. "I like having a selection and also having new people. 
It brings enthusiasm and high energy to the election." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Point candidates are: Addison DeBoi, Toni Gallagher, Ron C. Hascall, 
Ray Johnson, Harold Kaufman, Councilwoman Lloreda, Robert W. Moore, Witold 
Muller, Ernest A. Nelson, David Pytleski, William C. Shepherd, Robert D. 
Wilberg and Lloyd Woerner.

2 WOUNDED IN FIGHT AT CYPRESS HOME 
</P>

 Two people were shot after an apparent confrontation with at least six other 
people in front of a home Wednesday afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-year-old was admitted to UCI Medical Center in Orange in critical 
condition with a gunshot wound in his back, while a 17-year-old was treated at 
West Anaheim Medical Center and released, Sgt. Larry Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, the victims were in a vehicle in front of the home in 
the 5000 block of Marcella Avenue when another car pulled up. People got out of 
both cars and a fight occurred, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors told police they heard four to nine shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the suspects, four men and two female juveniles, went into the 
house, Jordan said. Police arrived about 3:20 p.m. and blocked off the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shook up. I don't know what happened, and I live here," said Trent 
Kirkley, who said he lived at the house with his wife and four children. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials told police that the two victims had been admitted, 
apparently driven by friends. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 minutes after police arrived, the six suspects left the house and 
were arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who by now had a warrant to search the house, found a gun inside. They 
did not know if it was used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said that earlier Wednesday they had received an anonymous letter 
critical of the house's occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had these kinds of problems in this neighborhood," said one 
neighbor, who did not want to be named.

COLUMN ONE; NEW FAITH AND FUROR IN RUSSIA; A HEADSTRONG PRIEST HAS REAWAKENED A 
MORIBUND ORTHODOX PARISH OUTSIDE MOSCOW. BUT THE SUCCESS OF EPIPHANY CATHEDRAL 
IS CLOUDED BY REBELLION, GREED AND A SEX SCANDAL.

<P>
 It is below zero outdoors and so chilly in the cathedral that the 300 
worshipers stand bundled in overcoats. With each prayer, chanted in Old 
Slavonic, their breaths fog the air like puffs of incense. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the place has a resplendent aura of warmth. On every wall, ceiling and 
arch, saints gaze from icons and angels flutter from frescoes. Hundreds of 
candles burn at shrines in all corners. 
</P>
<P>
 On this Sunday, a dozen priests, deacons and altar boys celebrate a four-hour 
Mass. Under one soaring dome, they baptize a child and two young adults, hear 
60 confessions, offer Communion, crown three couples in a joint wedding 
ceremony and pray at the caskets of two women who died old. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Epiphany Cathedral, and these are the believers who raised it from 
ruin five years ago. Their Orthodox Christian parish in this industrial city 35 
miles east of Moscow exemplifies the religious revival that has been sweeping 
Russia since the dying days of the Soviet Union. Thousands here and millions 
across Russia have been baptized, including former Communist Party faithful, 
claiming a religious identity that the Soviet system forced them to deny. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Epiphany is the story of one Orthodox community's rebirth and 
torment. It tells as much about the struggle in today's Russia over the new 
wealth and influence of churches as about the faith that draws people to them. 
</P>
<P>
 At Epiphany, an energetic priest named Adrian Starina has built a school for 
350 students, a rest home for as many elderly, a clinic and a 40-acre farm that 
feeds 500 needy people a day -- all funded by worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor credits the church, whose soup kitchen is busier than the city's 
three combined, with "easing social tensions to no small degree." 
</P>
<P>
 The police say church activity may be one reason Noginsk's crime rate fell 
last year for the first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But Epiphany Cathedral also shows a dark side of Russia's reawakening. 
</P>
<P>
 As a treasure trove of art and the seat of a thriving parish, it is a coveted 
prize. A battle for control is under way, deepening splits that already bedevil 
the Russian Orthodox Church and its 50 million faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the storm is Father Adrian, the cathedral's restorer and the 
parish's driving force. Known for his boundless civic energy and short temper, 
the priest quickly became part of the local post-Communist Establishment. The 
city's chief industrialist, the mayor and hundreds of parishioners back him. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrayed against Father Adrian are the church hierarchy in Moscow, deserters 
from his flock, an ultranationalist hate group and one of Noginsk's two 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old conflict -- still unresolved -- has featured a high-speed car 
chase, scuffles and all-night vigils on the cathedral steps, a mysterious fire, 
a condemned fresco and a stolen icon, two court cases and one unsubstantiated 
charge that Father Adrian raped an 18-year-old altar boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orthodox Christians are ardent believers, and when this conflict arose 
everybody became electrified and irritable," said Deputy Police Chief Nikolai 
V. Varlamov, who tries to keep the antagonists from each other's throats. "I'm 
surprised to see believers behaving the way they behave. Even I, an atheist, am 
ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Noginsk is a jumble of log cabins, Soviet-slab apartment blocks and half-idled 
factories that pollute the Klyazma River. Its 250,000 people live by a 285-acre 
dump, the biggest in Europe, where Moscow trucks most of its garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Civic boosters prefer to call Noginsk home of the first monument to V. I. 
Lenin. Five years ago, there were three Orthodox churches here. Today there are 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 Epiphany Cathedral was built in the 19th Century and closed by Soviet 
authorities in 1938. It was reportedly the site of executions by Josef Stalin's 
firing squads. A textile mill moved there in 1956, but the place was an 
abandoned ruin in 1988 when the state began returning former churches to the 
Orthodox clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the bells of 6,000 or more Orthodox churches have been tolling across 
Russia since 1988, more than double the number that were open then. 
</P>
<P>
 So impressive is the rebirth that President Boris N. Yeltsin and other public 
figures regard it as a civic duty to attend Orthodox services on Easter and 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other ways, Orthodox Christianity is losing ground. The church is 
plagued by internal feuds and challenged by aggressive foreign Protestant 
missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior clerics in Kiev broke away in 1992 to form the independent Ukrainian 
Orthodox Church, followed by millions of believers in 1,557 parishes. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 76 parishes out of about 12,000 in the former Soviet Union have 
defected to the New York-based Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, which 
accuses the Moscow hierarchy of failing to atone for decades of collaboration 
with the Soviet regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Fedin, 16, typifies Russia's newest generation of Orthodox believers. 
</P>
<P>
 He grew up listening to a religious grandmother challenge an atheist father in 
theological debates that only whetted his curiosity. It was the babushka who 
coaxed his mother to baptize the boy and take him to church. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei was 8 when playmates dared him to go into the ruins of Epiphany alone 
one night in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrible and scary, but I went," he recalled. "I wanted to become 
privy to its secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, he went back and made his discovery. By then the cathedral 
had been restored as a splendid work of art, offering religious inspiration for 
the aspiring young artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I immediately felt this was something extraordinary and marvelous," he said. 
"Only with time did I understand the meaning. It's hard to define, but I know 
that people need something to believe in. They cannot just eat, sleep and exist 
day to day." 
</P>
<P>
 Father Adrian's school has taken Sergei and other children a step further, 
immersing them in religious as well as secular subjects, and peer 
reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Igor Svetaylo, a friend and 10th-grade classmate, gave Sergei a Bible for his 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Noginsk, the main challenge to Orthodox belief has come from free-lance 
Russian faith healers. The church seems to be winning that battle, at least at 
Epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatyana Gavva, 35, an accountant, first went to the cathedral two years ago to 
break what she called a sinful dependence on Anatoly Kashpirovsky, a healer 
whose televised seances filled Moscow stadiums in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immediately after that, whatever he was trying to tell me I did not hear, and 
whatever he was trying to get me to do I did not obey," she said. "I was amazed 
to feel a heavenly divine force protecting me." 
</P>
<P>
 If something spiritual draws believers to the cathedral, it is a sense of 
community well-being that holds them. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Adrian's close-knit parish is a successful business, thriving on 
political influence, mutual self-help and outside charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioners say the short, bearded 50-year-old priest works exuberantly but 
on edge for 18 hours a day, exploding at times when hovering favor-seekers 
press too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Ukraine, the youngest of five children of a peasant soldier killed in 
World War II, Adrian was guided by a mentor priest to degrees in music and 
teaching. He taught himself architecture and, after seminary and ordination, 
earned the name "Adrian the Builder" for his ability to restore churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Epiphany Cathedral, where he took charge in early 1989, was his eighth 
restoration. By then he was quite an operator, adept at scrounging construction 
materials and working without blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very good at intercepting truckloads of bricks and sand," said Natalya 
K. Kekerova, a local journalist. "He simply stopped a truck and told the 
driver: 'Look, brother, I need these bricks to be sent there and there. Please, 
in the name of God . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Watching him in action, believers flocked to the cathedral with savings, 
jewelry and long-hidden icons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enthusiasm was enormous," said Galina I. Krasilnikova, the parish school 
principal. "It was a holiday of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 The popular priest was elected to the City Council in 1989 and to the Moscow 
Regional Council in 1990. He campaigned to help Mikhail S. Guberman, director 
of Glukhovsky Textile in Noginsk, win election to Russia's Parliament. 
Guberman's mill, the biggest in Russia, later put up $993,000 of the $1.75 
million drawn from local enterprises to restore the cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Adrian's Sunday services regularly draw several hundred people. More 
than 200 are active sewing clerical robes, tending the farm, cooking in the 
soup kitchen. They work for a token salary, a free meal or occasional material 
help. Food and clothing from Germany and Austria go first to church workers and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adrian has always been obsessed by the idea of setting up a parish that would 
be as self-sufficient and independent as possible from the outside world," the 
Moscow newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets said. "He tried to implement that idea 
in Noginsk." 
</P>
<P>
 Independence for Father Adrian meant cutting financial ties with his clerical 
superiors in Moscow -- and forging new ones with secular Noginsk. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Yuvenaly, bishop of the Moscow Region, asked repeatedly for 
charity contributions of 20% to 50% of Epiphany Cathedral's income between 1989 
and 1992, according to parish records. 
</P>
<P>
 In those years the Moscow hierarchy made a single grant to the parish: 
$290,000 to build a seminary. Father Adrian was even more sparing, sending 
Yuvenaly a total of $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to see what is being done with their donations," Father Adrian 
explained over soup in the parish kitchen. "The top priority for the church is 
to feed hungry people, but you don't see the Moscow Patriarchy doing that. They 
appropriate people's money without any accounting. That is a great sin." 
</P>
<P>
 One man who identifies with Father Adrian's revolt is Noginsk Mayor Vladimir 
N. Laptev. He also helps underwrite it. 
</P>
<P>
 The local government donates real estate for the expanding church parish and 
pays to lease some of it back. Elite teachers leave public schools, drawn by 
the freedom to write their own curriculum at Father Adrian's -- but stay on the 
public payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 A former middleweight boxer elected mayor in 1989, Laptev points to a red 
phone on his desk and recalls the humiliation of taking orders from Soviet 
bureaucrats in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the city is more autonomous, and so he believes that parishes in the 
church should be. Father Adrian's money comes from the city's people, helps the 
city's needy and eases the city's financial burden, "so why should any of it go 
to Yuvenaly?" 
</P>
<P>
 "If I worked for the church," the mayor reflected, "I too would have been 
fired for being rebellious." 
</P>
<P>
 The priest's troubles began in his moment of triumph in mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He had attained the rank of archimandrite, a priest of distinction. A major 
church procession bearing remains of an 18th-Century saint made a stop in 
Noginsk that summer so that Alexei II, patriarch of Moscow and All the Russias, 
could hail Adrian the Builder as a model servant. 
</P>
<P>
 Overjoyed, the priest immortalized the procession with a fresco on the 
cathedral's ceiling. Prominent faces included those of Alexei II, Yuvenaly and 
Father Adrian himself. 
</P>
<P>
 A Moscow church commission later condemned the fresco because it glorified 
people still living. 
</P>
<P>
 That summer, Father Adrian had a run-in with Pamyat, an ultranationalist, 
anti-Semitic group that has some Orthodox priests as members. Pamyat wanted one 
of its priests installed in a nearby church that Father Adrian oversaw, but he 
would not allow it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamyat's leader, Dmitri Vasiliev, began writing Alexei II and threatening to 
"yank (Adrian) by the beard from the altar." 
</P>
<P>
 The night of Dec. 13, 1991, according to a police report, Vitaly G. Sviridov, 
an altar boy, unlocked Epiphany Cathedral and alerted Sergei V. Kudrin, a 
deacon, who slipped in and stole its most valued artwork, the Icon of All 
Saints, then worth an estimated $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, detectives arrested both 18-year-olds and recovered the icon. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys obtained a Pamyat lawyer and made a startling assertion: They stole 
the icon to publicize a complaint they said the authorities were ignoring -- 
that Father Adrian had raped the altar boy and made homosexual advances to the 
deacon. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal absorbed, divided and confused a community accustomed to shrugging 
off such charges as Soviet KGB frame-ups to discredit popular priests. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the accusers were churchgoers. As black-clad Pamyat militants 
packed the courtroom, a judge set the boys free after eight months in jail, 
pending an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A second trial cleared the priest and gave the boys suspended sentences for 
grand larceny. By that time, a church commission set up by Yuvenaly had 
condemned Father Adrian for "indecent conduct." It also reported "canonical 
violations," including the self-serving fresco. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the report, Yuvenaly stripped Father Adrian of his duties on Oct. 1, 
1992, turning Epiphany Cathedral into a battleground. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of parishioners heard the announcement in Moscow and raced home, 
overtaking the carload of Noginsk priests chosen by the bishop to seize the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stood in their path," recalled Zoya I. Rumyantseva, an imposing nurse at 
the parish clinic who joined a human barricade at the cathedral door. The 
defenders swelled to more than 200, forcing the priests to retreat, and 
organized a 10-day vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 Two later incursions were halted -- first on the steps, then at the outer 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Yuvenaly ordered Father Adrian to a distant monastery and defrocked 
him for refusing the post. The priest then joined the New York-based Orthodox 
church, and Yuvenaly sued for the parish property. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodded by Pamyat, the New York hierarchy defrocked its new priest for the 
same "heinous moral crimes" alleged by the Moscow church. Father Adrian then 
joined his parish with the breakaway Ukrainian church, which last month 
ordained him a bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the scandal, the Epiphany congregation split, and a minority left. 
Three parish teachers were fired for opposing their boss -- one accused him of 
biting her finger in a scuffle -- and seven children were taken out of the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 As these dissidents see it, Father Adrian would have been charged with crimes 
or run out of town long ago had he not been so cozy with the mayor, who 
influences the prosecutor and police. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no secrets from the Almighty," Lidia Kuzmina, a founder of the 
congregation who defected, told Volkhonka. "Everything people are whispering 
about him will someday come to light." 
</P>
<P>
 But 800 parishioners have signed a petition in his favor and carry on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all boils down to the fact that this is a very profitable parish that 
somebody wants to get hold of," said Alexander M. Petrov, the deputy chief of 
police detectives, who investigated the rape claim and is so dubious of it that 
he left two sons in the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged rape victim's father, interviewed twice by The Times, could 
produce no copy of the rape complaint his boy supposedly filed a month before 
stealing the icon. Nor would the Moscow hierarchy show any report detailing 
Father Adrian's "indecent conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the moral question, you must know that not everything should be 
discovered," Father Alexander Ganaba, Yuvenaly's secretary, said in an 
interview. "There are church secrets that should be kept secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissing the issue of parish donations as irrelevant, he insisted that 
Father Adrian's gravest sin was refusing a new assignment. "We're like the 
army, only holier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly the point of so much criticism rising from other active 
parishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the hierarchy sheds its secretive, dictatorial ways, their priests 
contend, the Russian Orthodox Church can never fully revive or hold together. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Father Gleb P. Yakunin, a member of Parliament: "In every sphere of 
Russian life, even the Communist Party, changes are occurring. Yet the church 
hierarchy remains the iceberg of a totalitarian regime." 
</P>
<P>
 The next battle for Epiphany Cathedral is in Russia's arbitration court. 
</P>
<P>
 Its judges, who sit in Moscow, are sensitive to the patriarch's close ties 
with Yeltsin. Legal specialists predict they will order police in Noginsk to 
evict Father Adrian. 
</P>
<P>
 So the priest is arming himself for a battle of prayer and wills. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before his congregation during that chilly Sunday Mass, he wore a 
tall gold hat and wielded a gold crosier, emblems of his new bishop's rank. 
Archpriest Father Vladimir Medved, his lifelong mentor, spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "May all those here today love you and protect you from all evil-wishers," he 
intoned. "Oh God, may all evil-wishers retreat in peace and never touch this 
holy church, this blessed flock or yourself!" 
</P>

RABIN OPEN TO PALESTINIANS JOINING POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to restart the Middle East peace talks, Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin hinted Wednesday that his government would let Palestinian patrol 
officers join police forces in cities and towns throughout the West Bank -- but 
only under supervision of Israeli military authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the suggestion stopped far short of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization's demand that Palestinian police take over law enforcement 
responsibilities in Hebron, Rabin said he is prepared to negotiate over other 
security measures for the occupied territories -- if the PLO returns to the 
bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said his government might be willing to add Palestinian patrol officers 
in Gaza and Jericho. He made his remarks in a news conference with President 
Clinton after the two leaders met Wednesday in search of ways to get Middle 
East peace talks under way again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the White House meeting focused on ways to restart Israeli-PLO 
negotiations, Clinton and Rabin said they also discussed steps to produce a 
peace agreement between Israel and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Early indications were that Rabin's offering to the PLO failed to impress its 
leader, Yasser Arafat, who watched the televised news conference at his 
headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after it ended, Reuters news agency quoted Yasser Abed-Rabbo, PLO 
chief spokesman, saying: "We are disappointed by Rabin's position. The Israeli 
government did not respond in any positive way to our demands, and (this) leads 
us to a kind of a deadlock." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official said later that the Administration will brief Palestinian 
leaders soon by telephone to try to persuade them that Rabin was more 
forthcoming than he may have appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent round of Israeli-Palestinian talks has been aimed at resolving 
Palestinian self-government issues left unfinished by the historic peace 
agreement signed by the bitter enemies last September on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO abruptly broke off the discussions last month after an Israeli settler 
opened fire in a Hebron mosque with an assault rifle, killing about 30 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has since demanded steps to protect Palestinian civilians as the price 
for resuming the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rabin did not announce any measures tailored to meet PLO conditions, 
he assured Clinton that he is ready to negotiate the issue once the talks 
resume, said a senior U.S. official who attended the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said Rabin acknowledged "that something has to be done about the 
security environment, that something has to be done so the Palestinians will 
feel secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling that about 900 Palestinian patrol officers had been included in West 
Bank police forces before they resigned en masse at the start of the intifada, 
the Palestinian uprising, Rabin said a new Palestinian police presence could be 
worked out -- but only if the ultimate control remains with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't separate armed groups," Rabin said at the news conference. "There 
must be one chain of command of those who have to keep and maintain law and 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 Police throughout Israeli-occupied territories, he said, "have to come under 
the control of the government, and the government is the military government of 
Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Rabin said Palestinians can assume complete police 
responsibility in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho just as soon 
as Israel and the PLO agree on all details for interim Palestinian 
self-government in those jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If by now agreement had been reached, by now there would have been 8,000, 
9,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho," Rabin said. "The more the 
negotiations are postponed, the longer it will take them to come." 
</P>
<P>
 After the news conference, a U.S. official said Rabin emphasized that Israel 
will address PLO demands only in negotiations, not as bait to lure the 
Palestinians back to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin told Clinton that if he made concessions without a commitment to resume 
the talks, "these would be pocketed and dismissed as not enough and there would 
be no end to it," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the concerns of Syria, Clinton said he and Rabin discussed how to 
make 1994 "a year of breakthrough" between the Syrians and Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Rabin and Syrian President Hafez Assad "have a great responsibility to 
the people of their region." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the start of peace negotiations at the Madrid conference in 1991, U.S. 
mediators have sought to spur at least one of the most important tracks -- 
Israel-Syria or Israel-Palestinians -- at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria interrupted the negotiations to protest the Hebron massacre, but U.S. 
officials said the Syrians made it clear that they regarded the break as only 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready to negotiate, negotiate peace with Syria that takes account of 
our mutual needs and interests," Rabin said. "The promise of peace and its 
genuine benefits for all Israelis justifies making such decisions vis-a-vis 
Syria. We will not compromise on our security, but we will stand ready to do 
what is required of us if the Syrians are ready to do what is required of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin did not spell out specific steps his government is prepared to take 
to reach agreement with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and Syrian negotiators agreed on most secondary issues of a peace 
treaty more than a year ago but are deadlocked on core issues -- Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, exchange of ambassadors, trade and open 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria wants assurances that it will regain the Golan before it will negotiate 
other issues, while Israel wants to determine the nature of peaceful relations 
before committing itself to return the strategic highlands that it captured 
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.

HARDING PLEADS GUILTY TO OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE; SENTENCE: OLYMPIAN RESIGNS FROM 
SKATING TEAM. PLEA BARGAIN INCLUDES PROBATION, FINE, COMMUNITY SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tonya Harding on Wednesday entered a surprise plea of guilty to "hindering 
prosecution" and agreed to resign from U.S. amateur figure skating as a result 
of the attack on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 She was sentenced to three years' probation on the felony charge, fined 
$100,000 and ordered to serve 500 hours of community service under terms 
arranged with the Portland, Ore., district attorney's office. Under Oregon 
sentencing guidelines, Harding will not serve any prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding also agreed to create a $50,000 fund for the Special Olympics in 
Oregon and pay the county $10,000 reimbursement for "special costs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really sorry that I interfered," Harding told Multnomah County Presiding 
Judge Donald Londer after sentencing was pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's guilty plea came one day before she was scheduled to leave for the 
world championships and less than a week before the Multnomah County grand jury 
was to issue its final charges in the two-month-old case, which at one time 
involved investigators in four states as well as the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plea bargain, the 23-year-old Harding agreed to resign 
immediately from the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. and from the U.S. figure skating 
team now heading to Japan for the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was the reigning U.S. champion. 
</P>
<P>
 During her brief and poignant court appearance in Portland Wednesday 
afternoon, Harding seemed controlled and even smiled sheepishly when the judge 
asked her for her occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 She then put her signature to the guilty plea and sighed -- the end of the 
road for her in a clumsy assault case that accomplished nothing so much as 
making Kerrigan the most celebrated second-place Olympian in American history 
and reducing Harding to one of figure skating's most notorious and tragic 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said no other charges would be brought against her. 
</P>
<P>
 In his routine questioning to determine if Harding understood the consequences 
of her guilty plea, the judge asked if she was suffering emotional or mental 
instability. Harding paused and answered quietly, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Further questioning satisfied the judge that she was competent. But as a final 
part of the plea bargain, Harding agreed to undergo a psychological examination 
and treatment as may be ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, her attorney, Robert Weaver, told reporters: "She has committed 
herself to a program where she will seek and pursue some professional 
assistance in trying to find out what it has been in her past that has gotten 
herself into these personal relationships that have been so destructive." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Oregon law, conviction of "conspiracy to commit hindering prosecution" 
carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilty plea was an unexpected conclusion for almost everyone who had 
followed the case as the skater and her lawyer fought the U.S. Olympic 
Committee and the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. as they attempted to discipline her 
and weighed her participation in last month's Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding herself gave no indication of giving in to the legal system until the 
last moment. Only a few hours before her court appearance, she was on the ice 
practicing as usual at a suburban shopping mall rink. She also had recently 
shown off a costume designed for her appearance in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the plea came as a surprise, it was more or less consistent with 
what she had told the public: She had learned of the attack on Kerrigan after 
it happened Jan. 6 and did not go to authorities. FBI transcripts released 
earlier disclosed that agents accused her of lying about cover-up attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 But until she walked into the second-floor courtroom Wednesday, Harding said 
she felt her actions did not constitute a crime or even conduct unbecoming an 
amateur athlete. She frequently urged supporters to "believe in me." 
</P>
<P>
 All along, Harding has said she did not plan or approve the attack on Kerrigan 
ahead of time. And Wednesday's pleading ended the formal discussion but not the 
speculation of her involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Norm Frink said there was "substantial 
evidence to support Ms. Harding's involvement prior to the assault." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not going to plead guilty to it, but I think the facts speak for 
themselves," he said. The prosecution accepted the plea agreement because of 
the potentially large cost of a trial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, bargained for a reduced sentence with an 
earlier guilty plea to racketeering in the case. He said Harding knew and 
approved of the attack in advance. Gillooly was sentenced to two years in 
prison and fined $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other men have been arrested in the case -- Shawn Eckardt, accused of 
being a go-between; Shane M. Stant, accused of clubbing Kerrigan; and Derrick 
Smith, accused of being the getaway driver. Their cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault, a bruising whack to Kerrigan's leg with a police-type baton, 
occurred in Detroit just before the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Kerrigan 
could not compete, but she healed quickly and won a silver medal in the Winter 
Olympics. Harding won the U.S. championship but placed eighth at the Olympics 
in one of the most-watched television sporting events in history. 
</P>
<P>
 William Hybl, chairman of the USFSA panel that investigated Harding's role in 
the Kerrigan incident, said the association would continue its investigation 
and Harding could still be stripped of the national title she won in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she can no longer compete as an amateur, Harding can still skate in 
professional ice shows, which is what many world-class skaters do after their 
amateur careers are over. By various estimates, Harding has earned $1 million 
or more from selling her story in the aftermath of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Kerrigan and her family had been told in advance of the plea 
bargain arrangement and did not voice objections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kerrigan family issued a statement Thursday night saying: "We have been 
informed by the Portland authorities of the plea bargain in Oregon, under which 
Tonya Harding has pleaded guilty to a felony. Nancy and all of us have been 
through a lot lately. We need time to digest this news and discuss it as a 
family, and therefore we cannot comment further at this time."

A CITY MOBILIZES QUICKLY TO PROTEST RAPIST'S RELEASE; PRISONS: CLAREMONT 
RESIDENTS EXPRESS RELIEF AFTER FELON'S IMPENDING PAROLE IS REVOKED FOR FAILING 
PSYCHIATRIC EXAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A failed psychiatric exam kept a serial rapist in prison Wednesday, causing a 
sigh of relief in Claremont, where residents had mounted a virtually instant 
protest when they learned this week of his plans to return to his family's home 
upon being paroled. 
</P>
<P>
 Some demonstrators, who carried banners such as "Lorena Bobbitt, Where Are 
You?" and vowed to stand vigil outside the family's Baseline Road home to 
prevent Christopher Evans Hubbart from moving back, broke into cheers at the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our community has stuck together," said John Buck, 24, who lives three doors 
away from the Hubbart house. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart, 43, is believed to be responsible for 50 rapes over 22 years in 
California. He flunked a routine psychiatric evaluation on the day of his 
expected parole after serving almost four years of his sentence in state 
prison. The rapist, who is classified by the state as a sexual predator, was 
sent back to the men's prison in Chino, where he will have a hearing and 
probably stay another year in custody, corrections spokesman Bill Gengler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbart has been in and out of prison since 1973 and has been convicted of 
rape several times. In 1979, he committed a rape on the same day he was paroled 
for another crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 24 hours of learning about the impending release, the peaceful college 
town in the San Gabriel Valley quickly organized into an anti-Hubbart machine, 
complete with supposedly confidential copies of the convicted rapist's Justice 
Department profile, flyers bearing his picture and rallies going in shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those in front of the house Wednesday was Katie Girardot, who said she 
went to high school with Hubbart in the late 1960s and found him a "quiet and 
unassuming" youth. But, she said, "that doesn't mean I want him to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The wheels of activism began turning Tuesday morning when Ellen Taylor, 
president of the Claremont League of Women Voters, learned in the local 
newspaper about Hubbart's plans to return to the home where he lived as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really impressed with what we all did," Taylor said. "We hit the phones 
and just called a bunch of people." Members called local political offices, 
City Hall, school officials, parent groups and "any organization with a lot of 
contacts." 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall officials obliged with a podium and microphone, state Senate and 
Assembly members sent representatives and at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday more than 250 
people rallied on the steps of City Hall. By Wednesday morning, 20 people were 
marching outside Hubbart's family home. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Diann Ring, who was out of town for a National League of Cities 
Conference, came back Wednesday and within hours faxed a letter of protest to 
Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Rallying on a moment's notice is common in the upper-middle-class city of 
32,500 people, Ring said, especially for issues such as fighting U.S. 
involvement in the Gulf War, hillside development and police brutality in cases 
such as the Rodney G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Ring called the protests against Hubbart's release "a genuine groundswell of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the town's activism are the League of Women Voters, students 
from the prestigious Claremont Colleges, and 300 former religious workers and 
pastors from a retirement home, whom Ring calls "the conscience of the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Activists said they took their cue from residents in Northern California who 
protested the release of serial rapist Melvin Carter, who confessed to raping 
more than 100 women over an 11-year period in Palo Alto, Berkeley and other Bay 
Area towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter remains in custody after a Northern California judge ordered him 
released but gave the state Department of Corrections authority to designate a 
later time, a state corrections official said. 
</P>
<P>
 A key rallying point in Claremont was a confidential Department of Corrections 
memo that protesters will not reveal how they got. They reproduced it on flyers 
and handed it out at rallies. According to the memo: Hubbart is a "classic 
power/reassurance serial rapist" who has learned from his mistakes and 
perfected his technique. His victims were 20 to 38 years old. His crimes were 
committed between 3 and 5 a.m. when he entered homes via unlocked doors or 
windows and surprised sleeping victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychological profiles show that he is "uncontrollably compulsive and 
essentially immature," the report said. "There has been no change in this man 
since he started his rampages against women." 
</P>
<P>
 The information about Hubbart prompted cries of outrage from Claremont 
residents who were concerned not only about women in their city but college 
students on campus, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is absolutely ridiculous," said Arnold Simon, 70, a Baseline Road 
resident. "I'm frightened for my wife and the girls who live in the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ring said that because Claremont's plight paralleled that of 
Northern California, perhaps legislators may take notice and change the laws on 
sentencing to allow for a review before prisoners are released. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Southern California and Northern California are outraged, maybe we can get 
some action in Sacramento," Ring said. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, prisoners were evaluated for release by a parole board. However, 
for prisoners sentenced under recent sentencing laws, no such review exists, 
and sentences are predetermined by law. Hubbart cut his latest sentence of five 
years to almost three years with time off for good behavior and prison work. 
However, two months after the parole in 1993, he failed a psychiatric exam and 
was sent back to prison for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 When he again came up for parole this week, Hubbart had to take a psychiatric 
exam again. He was taken from the prison to an unnamed site for the test and 
then returned to the prison after he failed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Joe Donnelly and correspondent Andrew LePage contributed to 
this story. A History of Crime

during the process of being released from prison on parole, has a 20-year 
history of sexual offenses.

RIORDAN SAYS LAPD WILL BE OFFERED A RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY and JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan said Wednesday he will propose a new contract for Los 
Angeles police officers that will include the city's first offer of a pay hike, 
raising hopes that the contentious, 21-month contract dispute may be nearing an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan declined to disclose the size of the raise, but sources familiar with 
the offer said it would amount to roughly 6% over two years. Riordan, who will 
present the offer next week, is also proposing controversial work rule changes 
that could meet with serious opposition from the police union. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Staggs, president of the Police Protective League, declined to comment 
on Riordan's proposal but said the two sides "are getting pretty close, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 The movement in the city's position came as a renegade group of LAPD officers 
planned a "blue flu" for this morning to protest the stalled negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The union said that anonymous flyers were sent to some police stations this 
week encouraging officers to participate in a three-day sickout, beginning 
today. The union, which represents 7,000 officers ranked lieutenant and below, 
said it did not authorize the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-page flyer said individual officers were organizing the "Operation 
Quiet Storm" protest without the help of the union in order to sidestep a court 
order issued in November, during a previous mass sickout, that banned the union 
from planning such events. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willie L. Williams said he is monitoring the situation. He would not say 
whether he planned to hold officers over for double shifts Wednesday night or 
activate the city's Emergency Operations Center, actions he took during the 
union-organized sickout last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know whether we just have something that is a very sick game being 
played by some individuals or something that's real," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have been working without a contract since June, 1992, and the dispute 
has grown increasingly rancorous. Earlier this week, the league launched a 
campaign against the city's tourist industry by mailing letters and brochures 
warning of rampant crime and low police morale in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 As further pressure against elected city officials, the union said it has 
plans to put up billboards and release a 10-minute video knocking the city's 
reputation unless a deal is reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in his office Wednesday, Riordan said officers will be offered 
a three- or four-year package that will include a pay raise and concessions 
that would give Williams more freedom to transfer and reassign officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Riordan declined to disclose the size of the raise, two sources 
familiar with the offer said it amounted to roughly 6% over two years, 
beginning July 1. It would grant no retroactive raises, as the police union has 
requested, for the nearly two years that police have gone without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning LAPD officers make $33,157 a year -- more than officers in several 
of the nation's largest police departments. However, the pay level of new LAPD 
officers has slipped to eighth among the 10 largest departments in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3% yearly raises would equal the settlement reached between the city and 
Department of Water and Power employees last fall, although the utility workers 
got the hike for three years, not two. Since the settlement, Riordan has said 
he regrets granting such a generous contract to the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan did not disclose how he would pay for the police pay raise, which 
would cost an estimated $30 million a year, but he said he would make room for 
the expenditure in his upcoming budget. To raise more revenue, the mayor has 
said he intends to consolidate departments, reduce contributions to city 
pension funds and draw more money from independent city departments such as the 
DWP. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay increase may satisfy officers, but some union members said they will 
not look kindly on Riordan's effort to change work rules. City Hall sources 
said they expect Riordan to ask for the creation of a single rank of detective, 
instead of the current three-tiered system of investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The change would allow supervisors to transfer detectives back to patrol 
assignments without their permission. Supervisors have supported such a change, 
saying it will help to weed out stale and inefficient investigators. But 
detectives say that seasoned veterans who have developed their skills over the 
years could be moved on a whim, or because of personality conflicts with 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a deal-killer," one officer said of the idea. "It will completely 
destroy any chance of ratification by the membership." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan works with a committee of four City Council members to draft contract 
proposals. The mayor described council members as being "very agreeable" to his 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who is intent on drastically expanding the police force during his 
tenure, called on officers not to follow through on the blue flu or other job 
actions as negotiations reach a critical stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will negotiate in good faith at the bargaining table, not through 
media-garnering tactics and tactics that could impact public safety," he said. 
"The police still have the public on their side. The tactics the league is 
implementing and threatening to implement only work to lessen that support." 
</P>
<P>
 The council members on the negotiating team -- Marvin Braude, John Ferraro, 
Jackie Goldberg and Zev Yaroslavsky -- either declined to discuss specifics of 
the negotiations or could not be reached. Negotiations are expected to resume 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said a "premature" discussion of any proposed pay increase could 
bring demands from thousands of other city employees for higher pay, which the 
city cannot afford as it prepares to wrestle with a massive deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials for the city's firefighters said Wednesday that Riordan has 
promised them the same raise as police.

RULING ON HOLOCAUST DENIAL IS DENOUNCED IN GERMANY; COURTS: APPEALS JUDGE 
DECIDES EXTREMIST'S CLAIMS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO CONVICT HIM OF INCITING RACIAL 
HATRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jewish groups, politicians and the press on Wednesday denounced a decision by 
the highest German appeals court that an extreme rightist's claim that the 
Holocaust never occurred is insufficient grounds to convict him of inciting 
racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Court of Justice sent the case against Guenter Deckert, leader of 
the rightist National Democratic Party, back to a lower court in Mannheim on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although spreading Nazi ideas is a crime in Germany, the court said it was 
"too much of a generalization" to assert that Deckert had incited racial hatred 
simply by disseminating the view that the mass murder of Jews at Auschwitz 
never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against him shows "peculiarities" in its "factual and legal aspects," 
said Judge Guenter Gribbohm, who read the decision in court in Karlsruhe. 
</P>
<P>
 Printed copies of the ruling will not be available for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles, called the decision "a new interpretation of existing anti-hate laws" 
in Germany and said it "set the stage for whitewashing the crimes of the Nazi 
era." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said German courts traditionally have linked denial of the Holocaust to 
racism and racist violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, the ruling was reported on newspaper front pages and condemned 
across political lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The leftist Greens Party said it was "dangerous and irresponsible," while the 
conservative Die Welt newspaper wrote that "one rubs his eyes in astonishment." 
</P>
<P>
 "Until now, it was regarded in this republic as common sense that injustice is 
condemned as injustice and that there is no leniency for Nazi apologists," Die 
Welt said. "He who belies Auschwitz not only attacks Jews' human dignity but 
also shakes the foundations of how this society sees itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger added, "We must not allow 
the belittling or even the denial of Nazi crimes to be accepted with a shrug." 
</P>
<P>
 Only the left-of-center Social Democratic Party said the ruling was positive 
in that the court confirmed that the Holocaust occurred and refused to be used 
as a forum for those who wrongly contend that it did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Deckert, 52, a former schoolteacher, had been convicted of inciting hatred in 
1992, given a one-year suspended sentence and fined about $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He was charged after organizing a lecture by Fred Leuchter, an American 
neo-Nazi and designer of U.S. prison execution chambers who told the rightist 
party that he had visited Auschwitz and claimed to have proven that it never 
had gas chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leuchter asserted that no war crimes had been committed there; Deckert 
translated Leuchter's speech into German and marketed videotapes of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallacy that the extermination of 6 million Jews never took place has been 
spreading throughout the world as the 50th anniversary of the end of World War 
II approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a proliferation of books, neo-Nazi advertisements in college 
newspapers and even infomercials on satellite networks contending that the 
Holocaust did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
 As Germans reacted to the court decision, police tried to determine whether a 
fire that killed four adults and two children in a Stuttgart house occupied 
mainly by foreigners was deliberately set and if rightist extremists were 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 A 27-year-old Turkish woman, her 4-year-old daughter, a Croatian couple and a 
24-year-old German mother with her baby died in the blaze Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuttgart Police Chief Michael Kuehner said it was not known whether the fire 
was arson. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there was no indication as yet that the fire was an attack by 
right-wing extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 Extreme rightists have targeted foreigners in arson and other attacks that 
have taken 30 lives since German reunification in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's anti-foreigner sentiment and irritation with the Holocaust issue 
were highlighted in a poll released earlier this month in which most Germans 
agreed that their country "should not talk so much about the Holocaust but 
should rather draw a line under the past." 
</P>
<P>
 A third of the 1,400 German adults interviewed said the Holocaust "is not 
relevant today because it happened almost 50 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-two percent said they prefer not to have Jews living in their 
neighborhood, while 68% said they felt that way about Gypsies, 47% about Arabs, 
39% about Poles and 36% about Turks. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was commissioned by the American Jewish Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 German and European leaders have been trying to fight these sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French president, was in 
Germany promoting a German "passport" against racism -- an identity card with 
advice about what to do when witnessing a racist incident. The document is to 
be distributed in schools.

WELFARE PROPOSAL THREATENS AID TO OLDER IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking for money to pay for welfare reform, an Administration task force has 
touched off a struggle with immigration advocates by eyeing funds from a 
rapidly growing entitlement program that benefits elderly immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is considering a proposal to deny Supplemental Security Income 
benefits to elderly immigrants until they become citizens -- and immigrant 
groups are intensely resisting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be felt and perceived as a xenophobic attack," charged Cecilia 
Munoz, senior immigration policy analyst at the National Council of La Raza, a 
Latino advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials involved in the welfare reform effort and other 
analysts said that the dramatic increase in the number of elderly immigrants 
retiring with SSI benefits over the last decade raises legitimate questions 
about whether the ultimate responsibility for their support should rest with 
the government -- or with the children who sponsored their admission into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle among groups traditionally allied with the Democrats illuminates 
the difficult choices facing the Administration's welfare reform task force as 
it seeks the money to pay for its plan through cuts in other programs. The 
Administration estimates that welfare reform could cost as much as $6 billion 
annually by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important, the battle over the SSI money opens a new front in the 
polarizing debate over government benefits for immigrants. Until now, Congress 
has fought over whether to deny illegal immigrants access to government 
programs. But the proposal under discussion in the Administration, and a far 
more sweeping plan put forward by House Republicans, would scale back aid to 
legal immigrants who have not yet become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Some immigration experts said that they fear tying benefits to citizenship 
would impose an unprecedented form of second-class status on legal immigrants 
who have not become naturalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is an inappropriate linkage," Immigration and Naturalization 
Service Commissioner Doris M. Meissner said in an interview. "Our position as a 
country has been that with people who are here as lawful permanent residents 
you should, to the greatest extent possible, not make discriminatory 
distinctions between them and citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1974, the SSI program provides food stamps and monthly benefits of 
up to $446 for indigent individuals and $669 for couples who are blind or 
disabled, as well as elderly Americans who are not eligible for Social Security 
or who qualify only for very small benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are ineligible for SSI aid. But the program has become a 
major source of support for elderly legal immigrants who do not qualify for 
Social Security because they have never worked in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As overall immigration has increased over the last two decades, the number of 
legal non-citizen immigrants receiving SSI has surged from about 128,000 in 
1982 to 601,000 today. New applications for SSI from legal aliens are running 
at the rate of more than 150,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many legal immigrants receiving SSI are blind or disabled, government 
figures show that more than two-thirds are elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the rising number of immigrants receiving SSI benefits largely reflects 
the increase in elderly newcomers coming to the United States under an 
immigration law provision that entitles American citizens to bring their 
parents here. The number of immigrants entering the country to reunify with 
their children has increased from under 40,000 in 1985 to almost 65,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, immigrants arriving in the United States through family 
reunification provisions generally are ineligible for social welfare benefits 
for three years. During that period, the government takes into account the 
income and assets of the relatives who sponsored their admission. Except in 
cases of extreme poverty, the combined income usually exceeds the eligibility 
cut-off for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Congress temporarily extended that so-called "deeming" period from 
three to five years for the SSI program. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal under consideration by the Administration task force would extend 
the deeming period for SSI (and possibly other welfare programs, including Aid 
to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps) even further: until the 
new immigrants become citizens, a process that generally takes at least six or 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The contemplated change would affect only new arrivals, not those now 
receiving benefits. Refugees would be exempt from the restrictions and Medicaid 
eligibility would remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 By denying lawful immigrants access to SSI, AFDC and food stamps until they 
become citizens, the government would save $6 billion over five years, with the 
bulk of the savings a result of the changes in SSI, the Administration task 
force has calculated. Figures for restricting SSI alone were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant advocates maintained, however, that extending the ineligibility 
period for SSI would present immigrant families with an unfair choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "By proposing to cut essential benefits to elderly, blind and disabled 
immigrants, the Administration will put many families in the untenable position 
of having to choose between family reunification and poverty," almost two dozen 
immigrant rights groups wrote Clinton in late February. "Such a choice offends 
the basic values of this nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, immigrant advocates argued that, because relatively few elderly 
immigrants learn enough English and take the other steps required for 
citizenship, the change amounts to denying them retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the existing program questioned why U.S. taxpayers should support 
the retirement of elderly immigrants who have spent most or all of their 
working lives in another country. It would be more appropriate, these critics 
said, for those burdens to be borne by the children who sponsored their 
immigration to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that immigrants can bring in their parents to retire here, to incur 
expensive medical treatment, is a very troubling trend," said Dan Stein, 
executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group 
critical of high levels of immigration. "We can't allow people to bring their 
parents here from around the world to live and die at taxpayer expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Though immigrant rights groups promise a ferocious battle if the 
Administration proposes SSI cuts, even some legislative allies acknowledged 
that the groups face an inhospitable climate. 
</P>
<P>
 One measure of the current sentiment is a proposal put forward by House 
Republicans as part of their welfare reform plan. Under the GOP plan, all legal 
non-citizen immigrants, including those already in the country, would be denied 
access to all means-tested social welfare programs, including SSI, food stamps, 
AFDC, Medicaid (except for emergencies), school lunches and job training. Only 
refugees and aged legal immigrants who already have been in the country five 
years would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are offering them a choice: They have a choice of staying where they are 
or coming to the U.S. and not draining our services that they didn't contribute 
to," said Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, most observers said they consider it unlikely that Congress 
would approve such an extreme benefit reduction. But the existence of that 
proposal may make the Administration's plan seem more moderate and acceptable, 
even critics conceded. If the Administration proposed reducing access to SSI 
alone, Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said, "my guess is that it . . . 
will pass."

2ND COLON CANCER GENE FOUND; TESTS EXPECTED SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the discovery of a second colon cancer gene, researchers reported 
Wednesday that they now have identified the causes of more than 90% of the 
inherited form of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, the two genes are responsible for one in every six of the 
156,000 new cases of colon cancer diagnosed each year. They also appear to 
account for as many as 30% of sporadic (non-inherited) cases of colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers expect within a few months to develop diagnostic tests that will 
show whether an individual has either gene. If one of the genes is present, 
doctors can monitor for tumors frequently, enabling their detection while they 
are still curable by surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can reduce cancer deaths in these families by over 90%," said Dr. Bert 
Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University, a co-leader of one of the two groups 
that report the discovery today in the British journal Nature and Friday in 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery could also lead to new anti-cancer drugs within three to five 
years, predicted microbiologist Richard Fishel of the University of Vermont, a 
leader of the other team, which reported its findings in Nature. "I am very 
confident that in short order we will be able to develop appropriate 
therapeutics based on our knowledge of these genes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same two teams reported the discovery of the first colon cancer gene in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Both genes, which are found on different chromosomes, act like the spell-check 
function in a word processing program, checking newly synthesized DNA to ensure 
that no mistakes -- mutations -- occur during cellular proliferation. When 
either gene is defective, "you accumulate these alterations at an extremely 
high rate and cancer is the result," said Fishel. Inherited colon cancer 
usually strikes before the age of 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great triumph for science," said Department of Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala. "These discoveries . . . will lead to 
screening tests for high-risk individuals soon. Doctors will be able to save 
countless lives and prevent much needless suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala also raised the concern, shared by the researchers, that screening for 
the genes could sharply impair the ability of carriers -- people who have the 
genes -- to purchase health insurance. Because virtually everyone who has the 
genes will develop cancer, carriers might be excluded from coverage. About one 
in every 200 people has one of the defective genes, Vogelstein said, making it 
the most common genetic defect in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups said they have tentatively identified a third gene that accounts 
for most of the remaining 5% to 10% of inherited colon cancer, formally called 
hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. In 1991, other scientists announced the 
discovery of a gene that causes a rarer form of inherited colon cancer, called 
familial adenomatous polyposis, that accounts for perhaps 1% of all cases of 
colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers know a great deal about how the two genes work because Fishel and 
colleague Richard Kolodner, a geneticist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 
Boston, have studied virtually identical genes in bacteria and yeast for nearly 
20 years. In bacteria, the genes produce two proteins that carry out the 
"spell-check" function. 
</P>
<P>
 The first protein scans newly synthesized DNA to check for any errors that 
have occurred during its synthesis. If an error is found, the second protein 
binds to the first and repairs the error. 
</P>
<P>
 If the first gene is defective, mistakes in DNA formation are not recognized. 
If the second gene is defective, mistakes are not repaired. Either way, 
mistakes accumulate until a cancer cell is formed. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers are confident an identical process occurs with the human 
genes, but that has not been proved. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick discovery of the human genes, Fishel said in an interview, came 
about because of the extensive knowledge that had already been compiled about 
the bacterial genes, a classic example of basic research as opposed to applied. 
"This discovery is a coup for the basic research process in the United States," 
noted Dr. George Vande Woude of the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups are actively developing laboratory tests that could be used to 
screen members of affected families. That process is complicated, Fishel said, 
because at least a dozen different mutations of the new gene have been 
identified and each has to be taken into account in any potential screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The test is expected to initially cost about $1,000, about the same as the 
colonoscopy now used to search for colon tumors. Such testing will be most 
appropriate in families where at least three members have been diagnosed with 
colon or rectal tumors within two generations. Fishel said the testing should 
be conducted "as early as possible," preferably shortly after birth, because 
the cancer can strike in the teens. Carriers can also adjust their lifestyle -- 
adopting a diet low in fat and high in fiber, for example -- to reduce risks. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the screening is expected to decline with increased use, 
eventually permitting the test to be applied to the whole population. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some evidence that the genes may play a role in other cancers as 
well, including those of the lungs, intestine, uterus and ovaries. Such tumors 
occur at a high rate in families with a history of colon cancer, and defective 
versions of the genes have been identified in some of these tumors from 
individuals. Gene carriers would also be monitored for the development of these 
types of tumors.

IMMIGRANTS' DREAMS ALSO DIED IN PICKUP TRUCK CRASH; ACCIDENT: RELATIVES TELL OF 
THE VICTIMS' DIFFICULT BUT HOPEFUL JOURNEYS TO THE UNITED STATES. MANY OF THE 
12 DEAD WERE FROM EL SALVADOR AND SEEKING TO JOIN FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE LOS 
ANGELES AREA.

<P>
 For Miriam Elisabeth Arevalo, everything finally seemed to be falling into 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 She had arranged for family in El Salvador to care for her two children until 
they could rejoin her someday. Her half sister in Los Angeles had already found 
Arevalo a job caring for an elderly woman here. Relatives vowed to help her 
repay the debt of more than $1,000 still owed to the coyote, or smuggler, who 
organized her 2,000-mile passage from El Salvador to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would have done well here," her half sister, Nora Pena, said Wednesday as 
tears filled her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arevalo, 33, was one of 12 who perished when a pickup truck carrying 20 
immigrants crashed off Interstate 15 near Barstow on March 9. Also killed was 
her nephew, Edwin Elenilson Arevalo, 20, who was accompanying her on the 
journey. Most of the victims were Salvadorans seeking to join their families in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, as relatives made arrangements to ship the bodies back to 
Central America, mourners gathered at La Placita Roman Catholic Church Downtown 
to remember three of the victims, whose flower-bedecked, brown metal coffins 
were arrayed in front of the altar. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least my mother is going home now," said Silvia Guadalupe Alfaro, 
23-year-old daughter of Juana Basilia Alfaro, who at 57 was the oldest victim. 
"The worst is over now," the sobbing Alfaro said as she sat in the church pew. 
</P>
<P>
 Several families plan to hold wakes later this week. Remains are scheduled to 
be flown back to El Salvador starting today. 
</P>
<P>
 TACA, the San Salvador-based airline, has agreed to ship the bodies back 
without cost. Many families, fearing that violence may accompany Sunday's 
national elections in El Salvador, are eager to return with their loved ones 
before then. 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging stories of the dead say much about the separation of families 
caused by the mass exodus of people from Central America and Mexico to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Alicia Garcia Barrientos, 36, left California and returned to her 
native El Salvador last month intending to bring back her son, whom she had not 
seen in two years; the mother died but the boy, Odir Garcia, 10, survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted her boy to be with her," said a disconsolate Berta Alicia de 
Barrientos, the mother of the dead woman and grandmother of the injured boy. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's service, the exhausted Odir sat in a front pew, his head 
resting on the arm of his sister, Janet Garcia, 20. Another brother, Emerson, 
16, is still in El Salvador. A color photograph displayed by the coffin showed 
the proud mother and her three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Another victim, Aida Hernandez de Zamora, 34, had gone back to El Salvador 
last month to visit her two daughters, Vanesa, 8, and Raquel, 10. She had not 
seen them in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her not to go, that maybe we could work out a way where she could get 
permission to leave and come back," recalled her brother, Feliciano Ordonez, 
37, a resident of Los Angeles. He saw his sister off at the airport before she 
left for El Salvador. "I never imagined that would be the last time that I'd 
see her alive," the shocked brother recalled during an interview last week at 
the morgue in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Juana Basilia Alfaro, who lived in El Salvador, was eager to see her daughter, 
a North Hollywood resident, after January's earthquake. The mother had been 
repeatedly denied a visitor's visa to enter the United States, the daughter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the victims, like Jose Rosales, 20, who is recovering from injuries, 
had been to California before. Others, like Arevalo and her nephew, were making 
their first trips north, seeking opportunities not available in their war-weary 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to live now in El Salvador," Miguel Angel Miron Garcia, 
the widower of Arevalo, said on Wednesday. He lives in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 In Salvadoran enclaves from Boston to Los Angeles, news of the tragedy spread 
quickly. But few imagined that their loved ones were among the dead. The 
arrival times of friends and family from home are rarely precise in the 
immigrant nether world of coyotes, safe houses and clandestine border 
crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew about the accident, but we never thought our sister was involved," 
said Rene Saul Arevalo, brother of Miriam Arevalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossing the border and traveling without papers are accepted, albeit risky, 
parts of the immigrant experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all came originally through the border," said Pena, the half sister of 
Arevalo. "We all know the risk that one runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Identifying the dead has been a lengthy process. Few victims carried 
identification, as is often the case among illegal immigrants who want to 
conceal their identities in case they are arrested. Often, the undocumented 
have only slips of paper with the telephone numbers of relatives or 
acquaintances in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, nine of the 12 deceased had been identified. Eight of those 
were Salvadoran; the other, Rigoberto Ordonez, 24, was Guatemalan. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, immigrants show up at the morgue in San Bernardino, hoping against 
hope that the unidentified are not their relatives. Many leave relieved; others 
are not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight injured, four remain hospitalized. The driver, now identified as 
Wenndever Ordonez, 23, of Los Angeles, is being held at the jail ward of the 
San Bernardino County Medical Center. He is being investigated for vehicular 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central American Resource Center, a social service organization known as 
Carecen, has set up a fund to help families offset costs of funerals, 
transportation and other expenses. Donations may be sent to Carecen Barstow 
Victims Fund, 668 Bonnie Brae St., Los Angeles 90057. Information is available 
by calling (213) 483-6868.

HIV-INFECTED ATTORNEY LOSES BIAS LAWSUIT; COURTS: JUDGE RULES THAT GAY LAWYER 
WAS NOT FIRED FROM SAN DIEGO FIRM BECAUSE HE HAS AIDS VIRUS. CASE DREW 
COMPARISONS TO THE MOVIE 'PHILADELPHIA.' 
</P>

<P>
 Ruling in a case with similarities to the movie "Philadelphia," a judge 
Wednesday decided that a gay lawyer was not fired from a San Diego firm because 
he is HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Vincent DeFiglia ruled that attorney Martin Caprow did 
not prove that he was fired from the firm of Frank & Freedus because of his HIV 
status, which would have violated state discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow, who has developed AIDS, had claimed in a civil suit that he was fired 
abruptly after four years because the hard-driving senior partner, Eric 
Freedus, learned that Caprow's HIV status would prevent the firm from getting a 
new health insurance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a 36-page decision, DeFiglia ruled that comments made by Freedus, and 
remembered by Caprow's star witness, the firm's former office manager, did not 
constitute an admission that Caprow was fired because he was HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 The former office manager testified that Freedus told her angrily: "He's 
likely gay, he's probably got AIDS. We've terminated him. What's the big deal?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald McMahon, defense attorney for Freedus and his partner James Lieberman, 
hailed DeFiglia's decision and said his clients were the real victims of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense had asked for a trial by judge for fear a jury would be influenced 
by the hit movie, in which Tom Hanks plays a young lawyer with AIDS who sues 
his former firm. In the movie, Jason Robards portrays a mean-spirited senior 
partner and Denzel Washington plays a lawyer who helps Hanks win his 
discrimination suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our clients were unfairly portrayed by trying to draw parallels between this 
case and the movie 'Philadelphia,' " McMahon said. "This was an unfair and 
unfortunate ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow's attorney, Ann Smith, said she is concerned that the shock of the loss 
will further damage her client's health. "To say he is disappointed would be an 
understatement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon had portrayed the decision by partners Freedus and Lieberman to fire 
Caprow in April, 1992, as a painful one caused solely by a severe reduction in 
business. The firm has lost half its clients in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had sought to undermine the defense assertion that Caprow was the most 
expendable of the firm's associates. "There is not a piece of paper in Mr. 
Caprow's personnel file with a single word of criticism," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his closing argument two weeks ago, McMahon had sought to distance the 
case from the movie: 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither of these gentlemen is a character played by Jason Robards. Marty 
Caprow isn't Tom Hanks, and I don't see Denzel Washington anywhere. What I see 
is two fine gentlemen who have done the best they can under the law and they 
have been pilloried." 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow, 37, had received raises and bonuses and when he was fired was being 
paid $55,000. He was considered to be on track to becoming a partner. During 
the trial, Freedus and Lieberman portrayed Caprow as an attorney who had begun 
his career with great promise but then faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from the judge, Smith conceded that Caprow had never been 
subjected to homophobic remarks or discrimination during his years with the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow has been hospitalized repeatedly in the past year and has pancreatitis 
as well as cytomegalovirus, one of the opportunistic and deadly viruses that 
can strike people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Caprow joined Frank & Freedus in 1988 after graduating with honors from law 
school. The firm specializes in insurance and personal injury cases and is 
known locally for advertising for clients in Spanish-language publications. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon, after receiving the judge's decision, cautioned the press and public 
about finding parallels between movies and life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the parallels between art and life aren't parallel at all," he 
said, "but jagged lines."

ROUSTED; 'CLUB HOMELESS' EVICTED AS RESULT OF CRIME COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For three years, home for Don Wilson and a dozen neighbors has been a thick 
tangle of oleander and acacia bushes in the shadow of the San Diego Freeway at 
Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The tightknit community, dubbed "Club Homeless" by its longtime inhabitants, 
is more neighborhood than homeless encampment. Wilson and his neighbors have 
honeycombed this patch of ground with a walled bathroom, wind chimes, closets, 
dressers, a couch, recliners, coffee tables, a covered storage shack, a vanity 
area complete with mirror and other amenities of home. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two dogs and a pet python named Suzy Q. A large American flag flies 
at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday morning, the residents of the encampment -- some of whom said 
they had lived there five years -- were rousted by Caltrans workers and law 
enforcement officials who ordered them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, an unemployed plumber, this meant packing more belongings than he 
could possibly carry, including a makeshift kitchen, complete with 
propane-fueled stove and oven, dishes, pots and pans, a row of coffee mugs and 
a spice rack stocked with everything from rosemary to nutmeg. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they are doing is putting everybody on a Bataan death march," Wilson 
said. "They are not solving a problem; they are compounding a problem. They are 
basically saying that they want us to walk the streets until we drop dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the slightest idea what I'm going to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach police said they asked Caltrans to clear the area after 
nearby business owners complained about car burglaries and shoplifting, crimes 
that authorities attributed to the homeless people near the freeway overpass at 
the border of Huntington Beach and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not against the homeless, but we are against anyone who commits or 
supports any kind of criminal activity," Police Lt. Luis Ochoa said. "It's been 
a nagging problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had, over a period of time, a series of thefts from surrounding 
apartments and commercial buildings, and from vehicles, and we've identified 
that area as a source of these thefts," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and other longtime residents of the encampment complained that they are 
being punished for the actions of a few transients or runaways who have passed 
through the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Hodges, who is five months pregnant, began living in the makeshift 
shelter with her boyfriend and their two dogs two months ago. The couple 
receives food stamps, but both are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be here, but we have no choice," said Hodges, 21. "It was 
comfortable and no one bothered us. It's like one big family who can't afford 
to have their own house." 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless, who said they have worked hard to keep "bad apples" out of their 
encampment, note that beds in homeless shelters are in short supply; the 
county's estimated homeless population is 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the Mental Health Assn. of Orange County, a nonprofit 
agency, visited with the homeless Wednesday morning, providing them with 
information about shelters and other sources of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to let them know that there are some options that exist," 
program coordinator Paul Wager said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wager admitted that the situation is grim. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's less than one bed for every 10 homeless people in Orange County," he 
said. "There are not the resources being allocated to deal with the problem 
adequately at this time. It's a tough situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the appearance of law enforcement officials Wednesday morning was a 
jarring sight for the group, it did not come as a surprise: An eviction notice 
had been posted earlier this week in accordance with Caltrans policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda said the agency tried to handle the eviction 
"in the most humane way possible." 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give them an opportunity to pack up their belongings and their 
pets," Miranda said. "It's a sad situation; I wish we didn't have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the concern over crime, Miranda said, people living near a 
freeway pose other hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to remove them because of safety concerns for the motorists," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda said crews will clear the area of the people's belongings, which the 
agency will store free for 30 days, and will trim the thick bushes to make them 
less inviting to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Gray, a Huntington Beach attorney, had unsuccessfully tried to intercede 
on behalf of the group by asking Caltrans to delay the eviction for a few more 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had been there for several years, so to have them move out with just a 
couple of days notice is entirely inadequate," Gray said. "It's probably proper 
notification if they had just been trespassers, but they've been living there 
for such a long time. They basically had developed a de facto homeless 
shelter."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: SHAKE-UP BY BROWN SHOWS SHE'LL BE TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What Treasurer Kathleen Brown finally decided to do, as one adviser put it, 
was "to pull the pin on a grenade and lob it with a strong heave right into the 
middle of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "And now," adds the adviser, "she's walking serenely across the battlefield 
with a confidence I've not seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbing a grenade is an apt analogy for what Brown did Tuesday when she hired 
the explosive but effective Clint Reilly of San Francisco as her new 
gubernatorial campaign "chair." 
</P>
<P>
 The title "chair" is interpreted differently in each campaign, but in this 
case it means Reilly's in charge. Of everything. He'll "take control of 
creating strategy and will oversee all elements of the campaign's operations," 
Brown announced. It's like the coach of an NBA team also being the general 
manager and answering only to the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 But back to the battlefield analogy. Brown got fed up with losing ground to a 
vulnerable enemy -- Gov. Pete Wilson -- and concluded that to win, she had to 
make a bold move. Little had been going right in this campaign, despite all her 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally and typically, just as Brown was deciding last Thursday to act, 
she again was shooting herself in the foot during a minor skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
 A serial rapist -- Melvin Carter -- was about to be freed from prison after 
serving only half of a 25-year sentence. And Brown insisted that "heads must 
roll" because nobody from the Wilson Administration had appeared at the 
inmate's so-called release hearing. The governor countered that the Corrections 
Department previously had sought unsuccessfully to extend the rapist's 
sentence. And he pointed out that only the prosecuting district attorney was 
eligible to appear at the court hearing referred to by Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, under the law signed by Brown's brother -- former Gov. Jerry Brown -- 
the state was required to release the prisoner with half time off for good 
behavior. Carter, who had confessed to more than 100 rapes, originally could 
have been sentenced to 52 years. But Wilson said that a "lenient" judge 
appointed by Brown's father -- former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown -- had let the 
rapist off easy because he had cooperated with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoops. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown came through the melee looking like an ill-prepared, cheap-shot 
amateur who had misfired. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads rolled, but they were her own lieutenants'. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday morning, campaign manager Teresa Vilmain -- an Iowan confused in 
her first California contest -- had cleaned out her desk and departed. So had 
policy director Roy Behr. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In lobbing the grenade, Brown showed the toughness and fire that many 
political pros -- supporters as well as opponents -- were wondering if she 
possessed. This is the same woman, after all, who as a 19-year-old governor's 
daughter had the spunk to elope to Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is tenacious and a fighter, although these traits have not been seen 
much in this campaign. So are both Wilson and Brown's principal primary 
opponent, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. So Californians probably 
should get ready for one of the nastiest gubernatorial battles ever, 
particularly with Reilly given a command. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly -- who managed the winning mayoral races of Richard Riordan in Los 
Angeles and Frank Jordan in San Francisco -- is known to believe that for Brown 
to win, she must constantly attack Wilson. And she must strike quickly, he 
argues, before the governor can define her and make Brown the main issue rather 
than his own record. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Garamendi also know this, of course. And their strategy will be to 
attack Brown as inexperienced, shallow and "flaky" Jerry's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly also believes, according to insiders, that Brown has wasted too much 
time and resources appealing to minorities and liberals, especially feminists, 
who would vote for her even if she took a cruise until November. She should be 
competing for suburban whites and Reagan Democrats in the primary to keep them 
away from Wilson in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 She should be delivering a twofold message: The California Dream is becoming a 
nightmare and it's Wilson's fault. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly specializes in focus and discipline, two essentials that Brown's 
campaign has lacked. He also is a legend of volatility, having once "fired" a 
major client, then-gubernatorial candidate Dianne Feinstein. So Brown has to 
guard against this grenade exploding in her face. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's probably a good match. They both need each other. The controversial 
Reilly needs his first major statewide victory -- and so does Brown.

NIXON WARNS OF CHOICE BETWEEN RUSSIA, UKRAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Richard Nixon said Wednesday that the United States will at 
some point face a choice between Russia and Ukraine as a focus for its support 
in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, speaking during a one-day visit to Ukraine, said he was aware of 
concern in former Soviet republics over the rise of ultranationalist Vladimir 
V. Zhirinovsky in Russia after parliamentary elections in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that since the elections there has been a much more 
assertive position toward Ukraine and other countries" in the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, Nixon told a joint news conference with President Leonid 
Kravchuk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not say that most of the leaders go along with the position of 
Zhirinovsky and other extremist leaders. But there is no doubt that sometime in 
the future there will be occasions when the U.S. will have to look at Ukraine 
and look at Russia and say, 'Who do we choose?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, 81, said the threat of nationalism in Russia will recede once economic 
prosperity takes hold. He dismissed suggestions that Russia is about to "make a 
move -- certainly not militarily, nor economically." 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is a great power, but it would not serve Russia presently to take more 
on its plate than it already has domestically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk, who returned from a visit to the United States last week, said 
Washington has to support economic and political reforms in both Ukraine and 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be no serious confrontations and no conflict between Ukraine and 
Russia. Because this threatens the whole world, not just Russia and Ukraine," 
he said. "The United States has no alternative. They have one choice, to 
support reform and democracy in Ukraine and Russia, and not at the expense of 
either of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has frequently been at odds 
with Russia on political and strategic issues and has complained that Moscow 
received the lion's share of Western financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon also defended his meetings with Russian opposition leaders, adding that 
he wished that he had time to meet with opposition figures during his Ukraine 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The former U.S. President said it is important to gauge political sentiments 
across all sectors of a democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was snubbed in Moscow by President Boris N. Yeltsin after he met with 
one of the Russian leader's fiercest rivals, former Vice President Alexander V. 
Rutskoi. Rutskoi was one of the leaders of the armed opposition to Yeltsin last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon also met with Zhirinovsky, who claimed that Russia is on the verge of a 
coup, and with other Yeltsin critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did something in Russia that no one has ever done, something that I have 
not done in my 10 visits to the Soviet Union," Nixon said. "I met with every 
opposition leader. I covered everybody. It is very important in a democracy not 
to just meet the leaders in power." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon said he will report to President Clinton on the results of his visit to 
the former Soviet Union but stressed that he was expressing his own views.

RUSSIA AGREES TO CLOSE REACTORS, END PRODUCTION OF PLUTONIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia has agreed to shut down three nuclear reactors still producing 
weapons-grade plutonium, Russian and U.S. officials announced Wednesday, making 
Russia the last of the world's five declared nuclear nations to stop producing 
fissile material for warheads. 
</P>
<P>
 When the last plutonium is extracted from the irradiated uranium fuel rods at 
the Russian plants, in Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk, it will mark the first time since 
the beginning of the atomic age 50 years ago that none of the five major 
nuclear powers will be producing the basic building block of nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 While full implementation of the agreement is several years away, "Both our 
governments recognize that ongoing production of these reactors makes little 
sense in this day and age," said U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight years ago in my most fantastic dreams I would never have imagined" that 
Russia would stop producing plutonium for its nuclear arsenal, said Russian 
Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov, appearing at a news conference with 
O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, like the United States, has a surplus of plutonium recovered from 
dismantled warheads. Its continued production of the material has been a source 
of concern to the Clinton Administration and the arms control community. 
</P>
<P>
 In three days of talks, Mikhailov and O'Leary concluded a deal under which 
Russia will shut down the reactors as soon as alternative sources of heat for 
their communities are available, and the United States will help Russia find 
the money to pay for the new heating plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related accord announced Tuesday night, the two countries have also 
agreed to permit inspections of each other's plutonium storage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Plutonium is a byproduct of the irradiation of uranium fuel rods in nuclear 
reactors.

GRISLY GRAVEYARD SCENE MIRRORS MONEY WOES; RUSSIA: UNBURIED CORPSES LITTER A 
CEMETERY. MORE ARE ABANDONED BY RELATIVES TOO POOR TO PAY FOR INTERMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT BIVENS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a gruesome scene worthy of Dostoevsky, dozens of corpses have been found in 
smashed pine coffins apparently heaved off the back of a truck into a cemetery 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The corpses, wrapped in plastic bags, were first noticed early Tuesday at 
Yuzhny Cemetery, a vast wasteland drowning in mud and frozen snow and littered 
with broken-down machinery, scrap wood and old tires. One pile contained 31 
coffins -- many with arms, legs and heads sticking out. Crows picked at the 
body bags and at exposed flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like this," said a cemetery worker who identified 
himself only as Oleg. He and two colleagues were opening coffins, searching for 
a corpse with toe-tag No. 41: "We don't know who wants it, whether it's a 
relative or the police, but they're waiting out front." 
</P>
<P>
 The workmen eventually found the body and dragged it away on a sled. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of confusion, Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak explained Wednesday that 
the scattered corpses resulted from a disagreement between cemetery workers and 
a city morgue delivery crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery, he said, had refused to accept the corpses from the morgue 
because the city government had not yet paid to bury them, whereupon the 
delivery men responded by driving through the cemetery heaving coffins over the 
tailgate. 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery's director, contacted by phone for comment, screamed 
"Provocateur!" and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale lends a macabre twist to Russia's hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's second-largest city, it turns out, has been stuck with too many 
bodies to bury. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that as many as three of four people who die here are 
abandoned in morgues by their families. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 to 250 people die in St. Petersburg every day, said Alexander 
Avdeyev, head of a funeral service company. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 100 of them are tramps, refugees or criminals nobody wants to take care 
of," he said. "Moreover, many people now cannot afford to bury their relatives 
because it's too expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Tkacheva, head of the city's Department of Communal Hygiene, said morgues 
and crematories throughout St. Petersburg are filled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month, she said, many have refused to accept more bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The central morgue, in better condition than the dozens of smaller morgues 
attached to city hospitals, held 1,283 corpses Wednesday -- at least 400 more 
than its capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 In refrigerated rooms, bodies were stacked in careless heaps on tables and 
floors. In 1990, the central morgue handled 11,000 corpses. Last year, it 
handled 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Valery Andreyev, head of the Forensic Medical Expert Service, which runs the 
morgue, said that accidents and suicides have doubled in that time, while 
murders have quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the 19th-Century days of Fyodor M. Dostoevsky's novel "Crime and 
Punishment," when the antihero Raskolnikov murders an elderly woman with an ax, 
"they kill each other, but not with guns," Andreyev said. "People use knives, 
hatchets, broken glass." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, burial costs have skyrocketed, and the high inflation of the last 
two years has wiped out many people's savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest funeral in St. Petersburg costs 400,000 rubles, or $233, almost 
three times the average monthly salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's most beloved poet, Alexander S. Pushkin, wrote in the 19th Century 
that "the heart finds nourishment . . . in the love for a father's graveside." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment is vanishing today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wild," Andreyev said. "The level of morality in this country has fallen 
so greatly. If before we would occasionally meet a son or daughter who refused 
to bury their parent, today we for the first time are regularly seeing parents 
who refuse to bury their own young children.

 "People could bury their parents themselves, in a field or near their dacha. 
They could find a way," Andreyev added. But "last week, I had a guy tell me he 
couldn't bury his father because he had just bought a new car and had no money 
left. I suggested he sell the car, but he laughed."

<P>
 Ever since the smashed-up coffins were shown on television Tuesday, St. 
Petersburg has been in an uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors spread that the coffins were among those that had already been buried 
and that troublemakers had dug them up. 
</P>
<P>
 People who had buried loved ones came to the cemetery to check grave sites. By 
evening Tuesday, cemetery workers had buried all the corpses in a shallow mass 
grave.

SERBS, CROATS AGREE TO START PEACE TALKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Serbs and Croats, the main rivals in Yugoslavia's bloody breakup, agreed 
Wednesday to hold their first talks on formally ending their vicious 1991 war, 
which later engulfed Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between leaders of Croatia's Serbs and the Croatian government will take 
place next Tuesday at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, another indication that 
Moscow, as well as Washington, is pushing hard for an overall peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Balkan bloodletting began when Serbs rebelled against Croatian independence 
during the breakup of the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing war killed at least 10,000 people before a U.N.-brokered truce 
brought an uneasy peace to the one-third of Croatia that Serbs control. More 
than 200,000 people are dead or missing in the Bosnian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy on Yugoslavia, said the talks should 
yield a formal agreement ceasing military and all other hostilities between 
Croats and Serbs in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin said he will travel today to Washington, where Bosnia's Croats and 
Muslims are to sign an agreement on a U.S.-backed federation Friday.

PLAN TO SHIP F-16S TO PAKISTAN RAISES INDIA'S HACKLES; ASIA: THE WHITE HOUSE 
WANTS THE DEAL. THE BHUTTO GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY PAID $900 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Clinton Administration proposal to ship F-16 jets to Pakistan, despite that 
country's suspected nuclear weapons program, is raising Indian hackles and 
pumping even more venom into already embittered relations on the subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Pakistani point of view, if America does not allow delivery of the 
high-performance fighters, for which Pakistan has already paid more than $900 
million by U.S. count, it is no better than a double-dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling here now has become that you can't trust the Americans," a 
Pakistani army general who has served as military attache in Washington said in 
Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 To objecting Indians, the new American idea amounts to no less than acceptance 
of Pakistan as a full-fledged nuclear power. And, they claim, delivery of the 
planes would as much as quadruple the number of nuclear-capable aircraft in 
their most bitter foe's arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pakistanis are hustling the United States," Jasjit Singh, a retired air 
commodore who is director of the New Delhi-based Institute for Defense Studies 
and Analyses, complained Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said the Clinton 
Administration will allow delivery of the Lockheed Corp.-produced jets, known 
as Fighting Falcons, only if the government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
promises to halt its production of nuclear weapons material. She said that even 
if Pakistan agrees to the deal, it will require approval by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. government has presented to the government of Pakistan a complex 
proposal to advance our non-proliferation goals in South Asia," she said. "The 
proposal would verifiably cap Pakistan's nuclear weapons material production in 
return for which, following approval by Congress, Pakistan would be provided . 
. . release of up to 38 F-16s already paid for." 
</P>
<P>
 The F-16s, and American assistance to Pakistan as a whole, have been frozen 
since October, 1990, under the Pressler Amendment, which requires the President 
to certify the South Asian country as free of nuclear weapons as a precondition 
for U.S. economic and military aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan, a strategically situated ally of the United States during most of 
the Cold War, had received 40 F-16s before the imposition of the amendment, 
named for its congressional sponsor, Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.). 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-phase purchase program beginning in 1988, the Islamabad government 
contracted for up to 71 more of the Fighting Falcons and paid $914 million, 
said Air Force Maj. Tom Larock, a Pentagon spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the ban on aid to Pakistan took effect, Lockheed could not deliver 
the fighters from its plant in Ft. Worth even if Pakistan had paid in full. And 
last August, the angry Pakistanis told American officials that they were not 
going to keep shelling out money for planes they were not receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the two countries sort out their rancorous dispute, the planes paid for 
by Pakistan have been put in storage in the "boneyard" at Davis-Monthan Air 
Force Base in Arizona, Larock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, as part of a comprehensive reworking of the Foreign Assistance Act, 
the Administration proposed dropping the Pressler Amendment, but it relented 
when members of Congress concerned about weapons proliferation objected. 
</P>
<P>
 What Pakistan has managed to build is hotly disputed, but some Western experts 
say the country may now have six to 12 bombs of the Hiroshima type. The 
country's nuclear program was launched by Bhutto's father, who vowed to 
construct an atomic bomb even if the populace had to eat grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Shocked at the new turn in American policy in an area where he takes an 
especially keen interest, Pressler met last Wednesday with Indian 
correspondents in Washington. According to Indian newspapers, Pressler said 
Defense Undersecretary Frank Wisner had contacted him to suggest consideration 
of a one-time exception to the Pressler Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the only piece of non-proliferation legislation on the books, and I 
think we should be building on it," Pressler was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 India exploded a nuclear bomb of its own in 1974 and dwarfs Pakistan by its 
armed might as well as its population, economic strength and diplomatic clout. 
Pakistanis say the United States must understand that regional context and 
recall that the neighbors have fought no fewer than three wars since becoming 
independent in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're faced with overwhelming superiority. What do you expect us to do?" 
Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's ambassador to Washington, said in a recent interview 
when asked what stance she expected of the United States. "Help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Now back in Islamabad, Lodhi reportedly held meetings with U.S. Ambassador 
John C. Monjo about the fate of the planes. The Pakistani newspaper Dawn, 
quoting sources in the Foreign Office, said that in return for embracing the 
nuclear cap sought by Washington, Pakistan will receive 38 F-16s and other 
military equipment, including American T-37 jet trainers already on loan to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan is said to have demanded that the issue be settled by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, New Delhi's reaction was sharp and swift. "The supply (of 
F-16s) will encourage Islamabad to follow its nuclear program and force India 
to spend more on its protection and defense," External Affairs Minister Dinesh 
Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict over the planes comes at a particularly bad phase in relations 
between India and Pakistan. Last week, Pakistan tried to humiliate India before 
the U.N. Human Rights Commission for alleged large-scale atrocities in the 
disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir, but it opted to "defer" a proposed 
resolution when it became obvious that international support for the resolution 
was scant. 
</P>
<P>
 The F-16 is of special concern to Indian officials because the jet has no 
equivalent in their arsenal. A flexible, multi-role aircraft capable of both 
carrying nuclear bombs and engaging in dogfights, the F-16 has a long combat 
range, possesses superior electronic warfare capabilities, can be refueled in 
flight and can operate around the clock.

NATIONS STRUGGLE TO RETRAIN WORKERS AS TIMES CHANGE; ECONOMY: JOBLESSNESS DUE 
TO ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY IS A TREND. MANY LEADERS ARE LOOKING TO U.S. FOR 
GUIDANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In Canada, the government is poised to unveil an "internship" program as part 
of an $800-million initiative to help high school graduates find a home in the 
workplace. In Britain, a program dubbed ReStart aims to offer workers training 
and job placement soon after they are laid off, rather than when their jobless 
benefits run out years later. 
</P>
<P>
 And in recession-ravaged Japan, where lifetime corporate employment no longer 
seems like a sure thing, officials are beginning to think about an expanded 
government role in moving workers from declining industries to faster-growing 
sectors of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the industrialized world, government leaders are finally beginning 
to focus on one of the most corrosive, dangerous trends of the 1990s: the 
inability of modern economies to help ease the transitions that the young, the 
poor and older workers must make to keep up with rapid technological changes in 
the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, virtually all of the Group of Seven nations, which gathered in Detroit 
this week for an international jobs conference, are thinking about new programs 
to address the transition from school to the workplace, from welfare back to 
work and from layoffs back to employment in growing high-tech fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, the host of this week's jobs summit, was 
surprised by the extent to which European officials are following the Clinton 
Administration in developing re-employment and job transition programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found we're using the same vocabulary, and we are all talking about the 
problems of transition in the face of technological change," Reich said in an 
interview Tuesday. "I think there is a consensus now among the G-7 nations that 
we have to target our training and educational efforts at those people who are 
having the most difficulty coping with the restructuring going on in the global 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 For many Europeans, even acknowledging the need to change the way the 
government copes with such issues poses domestic political problems; many 
Japanese officials are still reluctant to acknowledge that lifetime employment 
is on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard for some of these countries to face up to this," said 
Lawrence Katz, chief Labor Department economist. "But we are beginning to see a 
consensus that they have to change. The British and the Canadians are doing it, 
and now we are seeing the continental Europeans starting to talk about new 
programs as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Europe and Japan are approaching the problem from a different perspective 
than the Administration, because of vast differences in how each nation deals 
with long-term unemployment. In America, the government provides basic jobless 
benefits for 26 weeks; the unemployed then are often left to fend for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, corporations traditionally have been able to handle retraining for 
their own employees, then have found new uses for them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, there are countries where workers can go for two years on very 
expensive unemployment benefits, reducing incentives for retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 But rich social safety nets have left many European nations with much higher 
unemployment rates than America or Japan. France, for example -- which spends 
more on social welfare programs, proportionate to its size, than any other 
major power -- also had the highest jobless rate among G-7 nations last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have traditionally had a system that gave workers a relatively 
short period of benefits and then allowed them to fall off a cliff, while the 
Europeans had a system that ignored people for two years or more while they 
were getting benefits, and they were out of the work force for such a long 
period of time that it became difficult for governments to help them to 
readjust," Katz said. "Now, I think all of us recognize the need to find a 
third way, that we all need to develop early intervention programs that help 
get people training and job placement quickly to keep them employable." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the problem receiving the most attention among major powers, Reich noted, 
is the hurdle facing students entering the workplace for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has developed its own "school-to-work" legislation, calling 
for development of national education standards and new apprenticeship 
programs. Administration officials say Germany's longstanding apprenticeship 
program is their model. Now, other industrial nations are following suit; 
France has passed emergency measures to increase funding for apprenticeships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to this conference thinking that the United States lagged behind 
Europe and Japan in the way we handled transitions from school to work and the 
way we dealt with retraining and re-employment," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, 
chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "But one thing I've 
learned is that the pace of technological change has been so swift in the last 
few years that even the Europeans are being forced to rethink the way they 
handle these issues."

U.S. BILLIONAIRE DONATES MILLIONS TO RUSSIAN CAUSES; AID: GEORGE SOROS HAS 
ALREADY SPONSORED SCIENTISTS. NOW HE'S GIVING $250 MILLION FOR TEACHER TRAINING 
AND TEXTBOOK WRITERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He brands Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's administration "more inept and 
impotent" than Germany's prewar Weimar Republic, and he professes to be 
"horrified" by the prospect of a takeover here by ultranationalist, 
anti-Western forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But billionaire George Soros is back in Moscow this week, expanding a personal 
crusade for what he calls an "open society" in post-Soviet Russia with millions 
of dollars in fresh commitments from his own fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the American financier gathered some of Russia's most innovative 
educators in a hotel ballroom and distributed grants worth $250 million to 
retrain teachers and write new textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days earlier, Soros announced a one-year extension of another ambitious 
project that in less than two years has doled out or promised $100 million to 
more than 2,000 Russian scientists to support their research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the most horrendous things happen here in the next few years, there 
will still be a Russia in the long run, and I think what one does now will 
bring its fruits in the years to come," Soros said in a brief interview before 
the ceremony with the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 When he started his aid projects here in the perestroika days of the late 
1980s, Soros recalled, "I threw myself into it with great enthusiasm for a few 
years. I felt it was a short-term thing. Now I think in biblical terms -- you 
know, 40 years in the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
 Soros, who made his fortune speculating on currency movements, is the latest 
in a parade of prominent Westerners to come and express alarm at the prospects 
of remaking Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who ended a fact-finding mission here 
Tuesday, said the huge U.S. effort to support Yeltsin's economic reforms was on 
"rocky ground" after Yeltsin "lost far more support than expected" in 
December's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 That alarm was fueled when the ailing, 63-year-old Yeltsin left Moscow this 
week for a two-week seaside vacation, and most of Russia's conservative and 
nationalist parties announced Wednesday that they were forming a united 
movement for the 1996 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks to reporters this week, Soros blamed the West for Russia's 
continuing economic decline and political retrenchment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the foreign aid has been designed to satisfy the needs of the donors 
and not the needs of the recipients," he said. "The joke in my foundation is 
that foreign aid is the last remnant of the (Soviet) command economy." 
</P>
<P>
 His criticism was echoed this week in a report by the U.S. Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the distribution of the $3 billion in official U.S. aid given 
to Russia since 1991 has been dictated too much by decision-makers in 
Washington rather than by those in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hungarian-born financier stressed that his foundation works with 
"trustworthy local partners," allowing them to design and manage the aid 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation controls the purse strings, and the money goes directly to 
scientists and teachers, bypassing the Russian government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a formula that works," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Science Foundation, the private Russian partner for Soros' 
program to aid scientists, will get another $12.5 million from Soros to keep 
operating through 1995, the financier announced. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Russian government agreed to match that donation and help the 
foundation seek another $25 million from foreign sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The $250 million in education grants is the costliest single program of all 
those Soros has launched in the former Soviet bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be managed over the next five years by another private Russian 
foundation, International Cultural Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a smaller-scale pilot program operating since 1992, the expanded 
initiative aims to publish hundreds of new schoolbooks, replacing texts 
designed under the Soviet system, and to retrain as many as 100,000 new 
teachers and principals so they can teach young Russians to think more 
critically and creatively. 
</P>
<P>
 Special grants will go to 100 secondary schools, public and private, that were 
chosen for their innovative teaching methods. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools are spread across Russia -- just 19 are in Moscow -- and 
non-Russian ethnic groups are dominant in 27 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The elite schools' principals seemed overwhelmed by the financier's largess. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always wondered how a philanthropist chooses where to spend his 
money," said Anatoly G. Kasprjak, principal of the Moscow City Pedagogical 
Gymnasium, which has 370 students in grades five through 11 and got a $60,000 
grant. "Some put their money into Italian opera, others into Canadian hockey 
teams, others into Greek antiquities. And here we have Mr. Soros, who, 
fortunately, seems to value Russian education as a part of world culture that 
must be preserved."

ARABS SAY SOLDIERS KILLED AT LEAST 1 AT HEBRON MOSQUE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arab judges and lawyers investigating the Hebron massacre for the PLO said 
Wednesday that they believe soldiers fired at people and caused at least one 
death at the mosque, despite denials by Israeli officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdel Ghani Awawi, a lawyer on the 11-member Palestine Liberation Organization 
panel looking into the massacre, said the PLO panel agrees with the Israeli 
army that 34 Arabs were shot dead in Hebron on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO panel, which is boycotting the Israeli government inquiry into the 
massacre, counted 28 people killed by an Israeli settler inside the mosque. It 
said army gunfire killed one Arab outside the mosque, one in the nearby 
cemetery and four outside Ahli Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli military officers testified at an official Israeli inquiry last week 
that the settler killed 29 people inside the mosque and that soldiers killed 
four outside the hospital and one in a neighborhood behind the mosque. They 
denied reports that soldiers shot at people trying to flee the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 But three Palestinian witnesses said Diab Karaki, 23, was shot dead by 
soldiers as he fled the mosque. Amin Khalil Joulani, 17, said he was shot in 
the legs by soldiers at the mosque entrance.

BRAZIL INMATES FREE CAPTIVES, FLEE ON FOOT; KIDNAPING: CARDINAL, 12 OTHER 
HOSTAGES ARE UNHARMED. CONVICTS ESCAPE AFTER SHOOTOUT.

<P>
 Inmates who fled a prison with a Roman Catholic cardinal and 12 other hostages 
left their captives behind and fled on foot early Wednesday after crashing 
their armored van into a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Aloisio Lorscheider, 69, complained only of stiff legs after his 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had "prayed for and forgiven" the prisoners who had seized him and 
other hostages at knifepoint Tuesday while they were visiting the jail as part 
of a human rights commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen inmates held sharpened spoons to the throats of the hostages at the 
maximum-security Paulo Sarasate Prison near Fortaleza, 1,750 miles north of Rio 
de Janeiro. A shootout left two inmates dead and two police officers and a 
guard wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 hours of negotiations, police agreed to permit the prisoners to 
leave, providing the armored van and weapons. In exchange, the inmates were to 
release most of their hostages. But instead, they dumped only the wounded guard 
out of the van as they sped past the prison gates. 
</P>
<P>
 With police behind them, the fugitives drove throughout the night. At one 
point, they stopped at the home of 22-year-old Robertson Francisco's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco -- one of the leaders of the rebellion, who was serving time for 
double homicide -- gave the hostages milk, his mother, Liduina de Aguiar Muniz, 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the prisoners apologized to the hostages, saying it was the only way," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fugitives and their hostages then took off again. 
</P>
<P>
 Another freed hostage, Father Aldo Padotto, said the prisoners grew desperate 
as the van had difficulty climbing steep hills. 
</P>
<P>
 After the van crashed into the tree, they abandoned it and let the captives 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was hours of terrible tension," Padotto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrived shortly afterward, after the hostages were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The inmates, armed with rifles and revolvers they had obtained as part of 
their deal with prison authorities, fired on police, according to military 
police Lt. Paulo Neto. Thinking the prisoners were still in the van, the police 
sprayed it with bullets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the confusion, the fugitives ran deep into the surrounding woods. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleeing prisoners were believed to include members of a notorious Rio de 
Janeiro gang involved in drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostages included two bishops, a priest, the prison director, a state 
legislator, a city councilman, the councilman's wife, two Brazilian 
journalists, a photographer and two others.

SHUTTLE CREW ASKS MORE TIME TO SET ENDURANCE RECORD

 Columbia's astronauts on Wednesday lobbied for more time aloft, even 
"offering" Mission Control $1 million, as they skimmed the clouds at the lowest 
orbit ever flown by a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time this week, Commander John Casper steered Columbia closer 
to Earth for the benefit of atmospheric scientists who have monitors on the 
shuttle.Columbia will remain in the lower orbit until the mission ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia, which began its mission March 4, is supposed to land at the space 
center Friday morning. If it lands on time, it will be completing the 
second-longest flight in shuttle history -- 13 days, 23 hours and eight 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the weather takes a sudden turn for the worse and forces Columbia to 
take an extra 1 1/2-hour lap around the world, the crew will set an endurance 
record. The record, set by Columbia's last crew, is 14 days and 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times Wednesday, the five astronauts beamed down a picture of a 
$1-million check made out to flight director Wayne Hale and drawn from the 
First Intergalactic Bank. The picture popped up periodically, and always 
briefly, in video scenes of shuttle activities and Earth.

JUSTICE ALLOWS GAY MARCHERS, BUT PARADE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sponsors officially canceled this year's St. Patrick's Day parade after U.S. 
Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter cleared the way Wednesday for a gay group 
to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment, Souter denied an emergency request for intervention from the 
South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, the parade's sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year's parade, with my client's traditional values, has been utterly 
destroyed," said Chester Darling, the group's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Darling said he would appeal Souter's decision to the full U.S. Supreme Court, 
but the appeal will be too late to save Sunday's parade. The city will sponsor 
the parade next year and gay groups will be allowed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is gratifying to know bigotry is against the law in this country," said 
David O'Connor, spokesman for the Gay, Lesbian Irish Bisexual Group. "The 
sooner the veterans realize that, the sooner we can have a parade we can all 
enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor said Boston's controversy does not exist in Ireland, where 
homosexuals are marching with little complaint or fanfare in parades in Dublin 
and Cork. 
</P>
<P>
 Darling argued that the veterans group had a First Amendment right to decide 
who was to march in the 90-year-old parade, but the Massachusetts Supreme 
Judicial Court ruled that parades are public events covered by a state law 
barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

WILL GET RESOURCES FOR U.S. PROSECUTORS, JUSTICE NOMINEE TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's nominee for the No. 2 post at the Justice Department 
pledged Wednesday to get enough resources for federal prosecutors throughout 
the country and said she will take a special look at the needs of the U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominee, Jamie S. Gorelick, breezed through her Senate confirmation 
without any expressed opposition. The committee is expected to vote later this 
week, and her approval by the full Senate appeared likely next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorelick, 43, the Pentagon's general counsel for less than a year, would 
replace Philip B. Heymann, a former Harvard law professor who resigned in 
January on grounds that he and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno had difficulty working 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorelick told the Senate Judiciary Committee she had discussed her management 
role with Reno and would function as a modified "chief operating officer," 
along with having a voice in policy matters. As the Pentagon's top attorney, 
she has overseen 6,000 lawyers, the largest group anywhere outside the Justice 
Department, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attorney general very much wants help in managing the department -- she 
wants a right hand," Gorelick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Gorelick's pledge to get prosecutors and law enforcement 
officers "the resources and tools they need" if confirmed by the Senate, Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) pointed out that the department's office in Los 
Angeles long has been understaffed in comparison to the region's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said the Los Angeles office, the second-largest in the country, has 
only one assistant U.S. attorney for every 91,000 residents, while New York has 
triple those resources. And with more FBI agents planned for Southern 
California, "there will be more cases for those prosecutors to work," Feinstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to look at that issue," Gorelick replied. She said she would examine 
the staffing of U.S. attorney's offices as well as the relative strengths 
between FBI agents and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans on the panel tried in vain to elicit comments from Gorelick on the 
resignation this week of Associate Atty. Gen. Webster Hubbell, the department's 
No. 3 official. Hubbell resigned amid a dispute with his former employer, the 
Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, Ark., over his billing practices. Gorelick said 
she was not familiar with the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said he hoped Gorelick "will be able to assist in 
addressing the growing concerns about the department's ability to effectively 
carry out its mandate . . . and by the early turnover in the department's 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) suggested that White House officials had exerted 
undo political influence on Justice, citing Heymann's criticism that the 
Administration had used Hubbell as a "key communications link" between the 
department and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorelick replied that she believed communications between the White House and 
the top three Justice officials was appropriate. But she said she would ensure 
that line prosecutors below that top level are "insulated from political 
influence" to guarantee their independence and professionalism.

COCAINE RECORD DOESN'T WASH -- BUT THEN, IT DOES

<P>
 What was thought to be the largest amount of cocaine ever seized in the county 
turned out to be a big bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster County sheriff's deputies handed the crime lab what they believed 
was 200 grams of cocaine. But lab tests showed that it was laundry detergent. 
</P>
<P>
 A chemical in the detergent may have triggered a positive reaction in earlier 
tests of the substance, said Tom Jaudzemis of the county attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 A felony charge of possession of cocaine against Ronald M. Berkland, 38, was 
dropped Tuesday. He still faces misdemeanor charges of possession of marijuana 
and drug paraphernalia.

NEWS ANALYSIS; FIRST LADY AIMS FOR HEART IN NEW HEALTH REFORM PITCH; AGENDA: 
EVOKING IMAGES OF DISTRAUGHT MOTHERS, STRAPPED RETIREES, SHE LEADS 
CAMPAIGN-STYLE RALLIES. GONE ARE THE DETAILS AND THE TOUGH TALK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 She talks about the cash-strapped woman with a suspicious lump in her breast 
who postpones a biopsy because she lacks health insurance. She recalls the 
elderly man who makes his costly medicine last longer by taking half-doses. 
</P>
<P>
 She knows hundreds of people like that. Maybe thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have so many stories," Hillary Rodham Clinton says, "it's like a movie in 
my head." 
</P>
<P>
 As the First Lady travels across America to drum up support for health care 
reform, she has embarked on a new approach. She has become a riveting 
storyteller, citing tale after tale of Americans suffering from insufficient 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the strident attacks on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries 
and lengthy discussions about details of President Clinton's plan. Instead, 
Mrs. Clinton is appealing to the conscience. The debate over health reform, she 
says, ought to be an exercise in national soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a challenge to what kind of people we want to be and how we 
help other people," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The anecdotes vary, but they all make the same point, often in a heart-rending 
way that can instantly silence a crowd of thousands, even evoking a tear or 
two. Mrs. Clinton's message, of course, is that the nation's health care system 
is badly broken and needs an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the President's massive reform agenda, which she helped develop, 
facing tough going in Congress, the First Lady this week hit the campaign trail 
like a candidate running for office, speaking animately at gatherings that are 
all but indistinguishable from campaign rallies, right down to the bands, the 
bunting, the signs, the cheering throngs. Even the choice of stops seems 
designed to evoke happy memories. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, she revisited the University of Colorado in Boulder, where she had 
drawn 9,000 people in a solo appearance during the 1992 presidential campaign. 
This time she drew a crowd only half that size, but it was no less 
enthusiastic. Gone were the Clinton-Gore signs, replaced by a sea of placards 
demanding "Health Care That's Always There" that overwhelmed the few Whitewater 
signs held by detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton spoke Tuesday at a rally in the Washington University sports 
complex in St. Louis. It was here that the first presidential debate in 1992 
was hosted. A jazz band of medical students, "The Hot Docs," warmed up a crowd 
of 2,700. "I feel like I'm back in the campaign," said a sleep-deprived, but 
smiling aide to the First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton has been speaking out for health care reform for more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the White House mired in questions about the Whitewater 
investigation, even Administration supporters are wondering about the First 
Lady's ability to get her message out. 
</P>
<P>
 Such concern may be misplaced, judging by the enthusiastic receptions she 
received this week in more than a half-dozen appearances in Colorado and 
Missouri. Upon entering the Boettcher Concert Hall in Denver for the Colorado 
Health Care Summit, for instance, the audience of several thousand people rose 
to give Mrs. Clinton a prolonged ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was "a resounding vote of confidence in the leadership of our First Lady in 
health care reform," said Orval Hansen, head of the Columbia Institute, which 
organized the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout her two-day outing, at least in public, Mrs. Clinton appeared 
energized and upbeat. But some who saw her at close range or in private said 
she looked fatigued. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the strain in her face," said Princeton health economist Uwe 
Reinhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton this week also was testing a simplified stump speech in which she 
merely enunciated the broad principles of health reform while shunning the 
messy details -- even when such opportunities arose during question-and-answer 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a deliberate strategy based on the Administration's growing 
realization that the public, already nervous about change, thinks Clinton's 
plan is just too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt the First Lady will continue to fine-tune her message as Congress 
searches for a consensus on health care reform. What is unlikely to change is 
Mrs. Clinton's starring role as the Administration's chief saleswoman, one who 
is driven by the conviction that the President's plan faces such stiff 
opposition largely because the Administration has not done a good enough job 
selling the plan's virtues.

HARDING SAYS SHE'S CHOOSING A REBUILT LIFE OVER SKATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding's statement Wednesday after pleading guilty to a conspiracy 
charge in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan: 
</P>
<P>
 "I make this statement with mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you know, on Jan. 27, 1994, at the Multnomah Athletic Club, I admitted 
that I had let you down.I failed to come forward when upon returning from the 
National Figure Skating Championships, I first learned that those who claimed 
to be my friends might have been involved in the Kerrigan assault. Although I 
was confused and scared, that was a bad decision and there are no excuses for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I formally admitted that mistake in an agreement with the district 
attorney. I am committed to seeking professional help and turning my full 
attention to getting my personal life in order. This objective is more 
important than my figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is with deep regret that I have notified the United States Figure Skating 
Assn. that I am resigning and will not be competing this year in the World 
Figure Skating Championships in Japan. The timing of the resolution of the 
criminal investigation and related matters has made it impossible for me to 
devote the full attention to my figure skating necessary to perform at my best. 
Moreover, I am concerned that to skate at worlds now would detract from the 
attention the other athletes in that competition deserve and would not be good, 
generally, for the sport of figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I apologize to the extent my decision today has disappointed my fans and 
supporters. More than ever, I need their understanding and support now."

TROUBLED CALEXICO HOSPITAL VOTES TO FIRE ADMINISTRATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The board of directors of troubled Calexico Hospital in the Imperial Valley 
has voted to fire administrator Robert Trautman from his $96,000-a-year job. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 vote came Monday night after months of feuding between Trautman and 
the Calexico Chronicle. The weekly newspaper's publisher and managing editor, 
Lupe Acuna and Hildy Carrillo-Rivera, are hospital board members. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-bed public hospital has been virtually empty in the last year and 
employees have gone weeks without being paid. Last week the Calexico City 
Council indicated that it would not loan any more money to the hospital until 
Trautman, who was hired in 1992, is replaced.

SIDE EFFECTS OFTEN NEGATE AZT'S BENEFITS, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The slight benefits of taking AZT, the commonly used AIDS medicine, are often 
canceled by the drug's side effects, a study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 The report casts even more doubt on the routine use of the medicine, which is 
often given to people who are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, 
but who are not yet ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies last year showed that, contrary to widespread belief, this use of AZT 
does not help people live longer, even though it modestly delays the start of 
AIDS symptoms. The latest work suggests that people may get so sick from the 
medicine that this offsets any health advantage of postponing the onset of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a trade-off between the benefit of a prolonged disease-free state 
and the quality of life decrement caused by side effects related to treatment," 
said Dr. William R. Lenderking, a psychologist at Harvard School of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenderking's study, based on 1,338 HIV-positive people, was published in 
today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients had low levels of the variety of white blood cell that is the 
primary target of HIV, but they were outwardly well. They were randomly 
assigned to take AZT or placebos and studied for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The AZT patients survived an average of 15.6 months without severe side 
effects or AIDS symptoms, compared with 15.7 months in the untreated comparison 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Severe symptoms of AZT treatment included prolonged nausea, vomiting and 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 At Burroughs Wellcome, which makes AZT, Dr. James Rooney said the study does 
not mean physicians should abandon early treatment with the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to patient choice whether they prefer to have toxicity or 
disease progression first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate report in the journal suggests that blacks are less likely than 
whites to receive AZT before AIDS symptoms occur. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the difference were unclear, but the researcher concluded that 
"culturally appropriate efforts" to encourage blacks to get treatment may be 
needed.

STUDY FINDS STEROIDS SHORTEN PAIN FOR SICKLE CELL SUFFERERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Injections of steroid drugs appear to considerably shorten episodes of severe 
pain that afflict victims of sickle cell disease, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
 These painful crises are the most common complication of sickle cell disease 
and account for substantial missed time from work and school.They occur when 
misshapen red blood cells get stuck in blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the episodes are treated with narcotics until they spontaneously 
subside. However, there is no accepted treatment to make them clear up faster. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report in today's New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Timothy C. Griffin 
and others from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas 
report on promising results with a new approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors found that two large injections of methylprednisolone, given 24 
hours apart, cut the episodes nearly in half. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, where the disease occurs mostly among blacks, about one 
of every 1,000 people has sickle cell disease.

 Eleven farms and districts that use irrigation drainage ponds in Tulare Lake 
Basin have been fined a total of $130,000 for failing to file adequate plans to 
eliminate toxic salts. The Regional Water Quality Control Board in Fresno has 
sent notices that operators of ponds located in Tulare, Kings and Kern counties 
will be fined for failing to file corrective plans on time or filing incomplete 
plans. Nearly one-third of the total fine -- $40,000 -- was levied against 
Tulare Lake Drainage District, which has 3,156 acres of drainage ponds.

 A former associate of Linus Pauling has sued the two-time Nobel laureate, 
claiming that Pauling improperly took credit for discoveries about the link 
between vitamin C and cardiovascular health. Matthias Rath of Woodside filed 
the intellectual property suit against Pauling and the Linus Pauling Institute 
of Science in Palo Alto in Santa Clara County Superior Court.Rath, who began 
work at the Pauling Institute in 1990, said he discovered a link between large 
doses of vitamin C and protection against heart disease. When Rath left the 
institute in 1992, Pauling signed an agreement saying that the institute waived 
all interests in Rath's research data, patent rights and publications, Rath 
said. Pauling told the San Jose Mercury News that he always gives Rath credit 
when speaking about cardiovascular health and vitamin C, but that reporters 
have not always included that in their stories.

 An award-winning poet who had battled schizophrenia for a decade hanged 
himself in a Humboldt County jail cell, authorities said. Eric Walker, 29, had 
been in jail since March 3 on charges of stalking and violating a court 
order.Jailers found Walker hanging from a bedsheet attached to the bars of his 
cell during a routine check Sunday. The county coroner ruled it a suicide. 
Walker, who won a $1,000 national poetry award in 1989, was highly admired in 
San Francisco, his publisher Tisa Walden said. Deep Forest Press published 
Walker's first book of poetry, "Night's Garden," in 1983. Subsequent books were 
"Jonah's Song," "Helen" and his final "Notes on a Surrealist," a collection of 
prose and poems written in a mental hospital. Walker had been in and out of 
mental health treatment programs for the past decade, said his father, Robert 
Walker.

 An effort to force a recall election against Fresno Councilman Robert Smith 
has failed by 23 signatures.County elections official Cathy Cisneros said the 
recall petition contained 3,957 valid signatures but needed 3,980. She said 
more than 1,000 signatures were ruled invalid. The recall effort was triggered 
by Smith's opposition to renaming a street after the late farm labor leader 
Cesar Chavez after first supporting the change.

SON, DAUGHTER-IN-LAW HELD IN SANTA ANA WOMAN'S SLAYING 
</P>

<P>
 The son and daughter-in-law of a woman originally thought to be the victim of 
random street violence were arrested Wednesday as suspects in her killing. 
</P>
<P>
 The son, Santos Alvarez Roque, originally told police that his mother was shot 
to death Sunday on the balcony of their apartment by gang members. In an 
interview later, he tearfully begged people "not to be so cruel, to think about 
the people who are affected" by the careless use of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Maria Bruno Soto, both 24, were arrested on suspicion of 
murder after police discovered differences in their accounts of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentina Roque -- a 55-year-old grandmother who had been living with her son, 
his wife and their 2-year-old son since coming here from Mexico eight months 
ago -- was shot once in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said that investigators became suspicious 
as they talked to the couple and analyzed the evidence at the crime scene and 
in the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the inconsistencies of their statements and the physical evidence -- 
which I cannot discuss with you -- the investigators believe that (Alvarez and 
his wife) are responsible for the homicide of Mrs. Roque," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, from what we were told, (we believed) there were some people down 
on the street corner and someone from that street corner fired several bullets, 
one of which struck Mrs. Roque," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton would not reveal the motive for the killing but said that investigators 
are seeking a small-caliber handgun that belongs to Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, at about the same time that investigators began to suspect that 
Alvarez was the killer, he said in an interview: "I am a Catholic and believe 
that whoever did this will pay before God." Weeping, he guessed that his mother 
had been the victim of gang- or drug-related violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year-old boy who was arrested Monday on suspicion of the Roque shooting 
is no longer a suspect, Helton said. The youth reportedly had pointed a gun at 
a police officer.

A SICKLY SHOWING BY KINGS; HOCKEY: GRETZKY, BATTLING FLU, IS SHUT OUT, AND HIS 
TEAM IS EMBARRASSED BY MIGHTY DUCKS, 5-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So the Kings mustered all of their resolve this week -- and managed to 
manhandle the NHL's worst team, the Ottawa Senators. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after their positive-thinking session, the Kings were positively 
embarrassed Wednesday night by the Mighty Ducks, who beat them for the first 
time, 5-2, in front of 17,174 at the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks aren't a harmless rival, either. They are the Kings' competition in 
pursuit of San Jose for the final Western Conference playoff spot, and by 
winning, the Ducks crawled back into the thick of it. They trail eighth-place 
San Jose by four points -- though San Jose could easily regain the ground 
tonight, when the Sharks play Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Duck Coach Ron Wilson: "Over the last month, I haven't heard them (the 
Kings) mention us as being ahead of them in the playoff race. It's always been 
San Jose. Now hopefully we'll get their respect. They looked past us maybe. I 
think we've finally earned their respect." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings remain seven points back, but two games against San Jose this 
weekend could decide whether their playoff hopes are dead in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Said King Coach Barry Melrose: "What do you want me to say? There are no 
excuses. I've never made excuses. We've got to make up seven points. If we 
don't beat them (San Jose), that will make it tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Kings and Ducks played, Wayne Gretzky beat the Ducks almost 
single-handedly with an inspired five-point performance. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Gretzky was so ill with flu that he vomited on the team bus the 
night before the game and was inhaling oxygen on the bench during the game.  
</P>
<P>
 He got no closer to Gordie Howe's all-time record of 801 goals. No. 99 is 
still on 799 and needs two goals to tie Howe, three to pass him. Gretzky still 
made a game effort, trying four shots in the first period alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, who have been dragging lately, suddenly found jump in legs Wilson 
thought were exhausted. Tim Sweeney scored two goals, and the Ducks got a spark 
from recently acquired center Stephan Lebeau and right wing John Lilley, who 
played for the U.S. Olympic team at Lillehammer and was making his NHL debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as crucial was the play of backup goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov, whose 
sharpness lately earned him the start. He made 31 saves for his second NHL 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duck power play, which had spiraled to dead-last in the NHL recently, was 
suddenly revived. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring on only three of their previous 63 chances with a man advantage, 
the Ducks scored three power-play goals against the Kings -- and turned a 1-1 
tie into a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the difference in the game," said Wilson. "Yesterday we spent a good 
hour on it, just moving the puck, moving our legs. It was the difference in the 
game, if we didn't score those power-play goals, it would have been a 2-2 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 With Tony Granato in the penalty box for holding the opponent's stick early in 
the second, Duck right wing Terry Yake faked a shot from the left side, then 
passed cleanly across the slot to defenseman David Williams, whose shot beat 
Kelly Hrudey at 3:22. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, with Alex Zhitnik off, once again for holding the opponent's stick, 
Lebeau swooped in to knock home a loose rebound from the right side of the net. 
Joe Sacco and Troy Loney had kept the rebound alive in front of the net after 
Hrudey stopped Bill Houlder's point shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings went in after two periods trailing, 3-1, but had to kill off the end 
of a Jari Kurri high-sticking penalty to start the third. They didn't do it, as 
Sweeney scored on a rebound 40 seconds into the period. That gave the Ducks a 
three-goal lead -- plenty big enough to dig in defensively for the rest of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney added another goal in the third for a 5-1 lead, and it stood up 
despite a review that appeared to show him directing it in with his skate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Donnelly scored the Kings' second goal, but it was too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks had taken the original lead at 12:27 of the first period, after 
Lebeau sent Sacco out on a breakaway with a perfect pass that the speedy Sacco 
picked up out front. He skated in on Hrudey, shooting from such close range 
that his stick hit Hrudey in the neck area and the goalie needed a couple of 
minutes to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck-King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Olympic star Paul Kariya, whose contract talks with the Mighty Ducks 
remain stalled, said he doesn't feel compelled to join the NHL before the 
season ends. "It can wait," Kariya told Canadian Press from his family's home 
in North Vancouver, Canada. "(This is) the first chance I've really had to 
regroup and rest in two years. That has to be good for me. My body feels 
rested, not battered and bruised. I do not feel any necessity to play in the 
NHL right now." With the sides still millions apart on a multiyear deal, the 
next team Kariya plays with will probably be Team Canada in the World 
Championships in April in Italy. "If things do not get resolved, I would love 
to play in the World Championships. It would be redemption," said Kariya, who 
was stopped on a penalty shot in a shootout in the Olympic gold-medal game 
against Sweden. "I've gone over that penalty shot about 200 times in my mind." 
. . . Duck center Anatoli Semenov returned after missing the last seven games 
because of a sore elbow.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; USC IS GOOD ENOUGH; WOMEN'S 
MIDEAST REGIONAL: TROJANS DEFEAT PORTLAND, 77-62, IN SUB-PAR SHOWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ayesha Shields, 8-year-old daughter of USC guard Karleen Shields, had her game 
face on before her mother's team took the floor to play Portland in a 
first-round NCAA tournament game Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how her mom's team would fare, she replied, with furrowed brows: "We're 
going to beat 'em up, tear their heads off and make 'em cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappily for USC, Mama Shields wasn't nearly that prepared, nor were most of 
her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 USC defeated Portland, 77-62, at the Sports Arena, but it was a second 
consecutive sub-par outing for Coach Cheryl Miller's Pacific 10 Conference 
champions, and Miller again wondered about her team's intensity.  
</P>
<P>
 Portland (17-12) never led, but the Pilots were never out of it until the 
final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (23-3) advances to the second round to play George Washington (23-7) on 
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe we took them lightly, but we certainly didn't match their 
intensity," Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
 Tina Thompson, the Pac-10 freshman of the year, said the Trojans got by on 
pure ability.  
</P>
<P>
 "This team could have beaten us. . . . Our athleticism kept us in the game," 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller was so upset with her team's conference-ending victory over Oregon 
State on Saturday that she stormed out of the Lyon Center without talking to 
the media. As her team proceeds in the tournament's Mideast Regional, she's 
confronted with two deficiencies: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Her team has lost its three-point shooting touch. The Trojans made four of 
19 three-point shots on Wednesday, with four airballs, after five of 17 on 
Saturday. USC entered the game shooting 32% from three-point range. Twenty-five 
NCAA teams made more than 36% of their three-pointers this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Against a much slower team Wednesday, USC's more talented, more athletic 
players were plodders, never mustering a single offensive surge. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, only once did Miller's team execute a play with sizzle. With 6:40 to 
play, on a breakaway, Lisa Leslie made a great pass to Nicky McCrimmon, who 
made a great pass to Thompson, who scored on a falling-down layup. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was fouled and made the free throw to give USC a 61-52 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 That put the crowd of 1,458 in the game for the first time, but it didn't faze 
the Pilots, recent upset winners of the West Coast Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Johanson scored on a jump shot and Deana Lansing made a three-point shot 
to put Portland within 61-57 with 5:45 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But USC's inside duo of Leslie and Thompson, aided by point guard McCrimmon's 
passing, took over down the stretch against the rapidly tiring Pilots. Portland 
made only two shots in the last 4:48. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller expressed hope afterward that her team's outside shooting will improve 
when its inside game becomes more productive.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to understand our game is to get the ball inside," she said. "When 
we do that effectively. it'll open up our outside game." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie chalked it up to a rare opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the Pac-10 teams we play, we pretty much know 50% of the time which 
shooter's going to get the ball," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, all their players shot well. On defense, we were a step behind the 
whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, who played 30 minutes, led all scorers with 26 points. She had 12 
rebounds and Thompson had 14, with 20 points. McCrimmon had 16 points and 10 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Karleen Shields made one of seven shots and had three turnovers.

LAKERS EXCEL AGAINST BULLETS; PRO BASKETBALL: VAN EXEL SCORES 21 AS TEAM ROUTS 
WASHINGTON, 129-94, TO KEEP WINNING ON COURT AND LOSING IN PLAYER DRAFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 What price victory? 
</P>
<P>
 Laker fans wonder that on a regular basis these days, with their team winning 
and maybe only getting into trouble because of it. The more victories, the 
fewer Ping-Pong balls in the lottery. Therein lies the rub. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, what they say is probably right," Sedale Threatt sad Wednesday 
night, when the Lakers routed the Washington Bullets, 129-94, at the Forum for 
their sixth victory in the last nine games. "But as a player, that's not in my 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the Laker approach. While they can only lose for winning -- and 
now face the possibility of getting the 10th or 11th pick in the draft instead 
of the top-six choice they were once on track for -- a tone is being set: 
Losses are not good. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that way on the final night of the 1991-92 regular season too. The 
Lakers could have gone into the lottery, but instead went into overtime against 
the Clippers and won to earn a playoff berth. How disappointed were they? 
General Manager Jerry West said afterward, "I don't think I've ever been more 
proud of a Laker team." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Threatt: "Because of our record and the fact that we are rebuilding, we 
definitely want to go in and get a good pick. But it's tough on a guy like 
myself who has always been in the playoffs. I'm a winner and I want us to go 
out and win every game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Laker Coach Randy Pfund: "There's not a coach who doesn't try to win 
basketball games. That's what we try to do. I understand that mentality, of 
people wanting a top draft choice. . . . But, to me, I'd rather stay on the 
side of doing more than people thought we would." 
</P>
<P>
 With 21 games left, 13 of them at the Forum, the Lakers are five games behind 
Denver for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot. But the 
Nuggets are entering what could best be described as the slow-pitch portion of 
their schedule: the Clippers, Sacramento, Washington, Milwaukee, Miami and 
Dallas being propped up in the next six outings, the only away game coming 
tonight at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers inched a half-game closer by routing Washington, going ahead by 18 
points in the first quarter while shooting 66.7% and by 24 at halftime, 69-45, 
at 63.3%. When the teams met 11 days ago in Landover, Md., the Bullets, looking 
to capture the season series for the first time since 1975-76, had scored 45 
points by the time the second period was barely two minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the Lakers' last home game, when the Mavericks came back from a 
28-point first-quarter deficit to temporarily take the lead before falling, 
there was no comeback for the Bullets, who fell behind by as many as 38 points 
in the second half and got no closer than 24. 
</P>
<P>
 All 11 Lakers -- James Edwards is in Seattle to be with his sick mother -- 
scored. Nick Van Exel led the way with 21 points and 11 assists and Elden 
Campbell had 18 points and 10 assists en route to the Lakers' highest scoring 
output of the season and the biggest winning margin. Los Angeles also dominated 
the boards, 61-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Christie played 30 minutes, the most since Jan. 9 against San Antonio at 
the Forum, his last start and his last game before suffering a badly sprained 
ankle that sidelined him for 16 games. Many of the minutes Wednesday came at 
his old position, small forward. . . . Rex Chapman had 24 points for the 
Bullets.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: NELSON TOOK A RIBBING AFTER HOWARD'S SLAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outfielder Kevin Howard had just launched a grand slam to give Cal State 
Northridge the lead in the eighth inning of a 9-6 victory over Hawaii on 
Sunday. Tyler Nelson, the Matadors' third baseman, was the next batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii right-hander Mark Johnson, flustered and frustrated after surrendering 
Howard's blast, buried a fastball into Nelson's ribs and was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Both benches cleared, but no contact was made. Nelson didn't join the 
festivities around home plate. He walked toward first base and didn't make a 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a feeling that (Johnson) might come inside," Nelson said. I thought 
about doing something, but I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just happy that we'd taken the lead and that I got a free base." 
</P>
<P>
 There was more to be, uh, happy about. Johnson's heater left Nelson with a 
black-and-blue mark the size of a softball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls love this stuff," Nelson said. CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 No Further Action 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a freshman, will not be subject to further penalty by the Western 
Athletic Conference, Associate Commissioner Jeff Hurd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurd said that generally only players involved in fights are subject to a 
one-game suspension. Though both benches emptied after Nelson was hit, no 
contact was made between players. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the WAC's somewhat vague "special circumstances" clause. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game between WAC East Division rivals Brigham Young and Utah a few years 
back, Hurd said, a pitcher blew a lead by giving up a home run and was ragged 
mercilessly by the opposition. The next batter stepped in. The pitcher went 
into the windup, wheeled . . . and fired the ball into the opposing dugout. He 
was suspended for a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would qualify as a special circumstance," Hurd cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Howard launched the clutch slam to beat Hawaii, nobody in the Northridge 
dugout was particularly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Howard's third homer entering play this week and all three have either 
broken a tie or erased a deficit. What's more, each proved to be the 
game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit: 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 13 at UCLA: With the score tied, 7-7, in the 11th inning, Howard's 
three-run homer gave Northridge a 10-7 victory.

 * March 6 at UC Santa Barbara: With Northridge trailing by a run, Howard's 
two-run homer in the eighth gave the Matadors a 5-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the reasons we recruited him," Coach Bill Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's most significant blow came two years ago in the state junior college 
championship game, when he was a freshman at Fresno City College. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied and two out in the bottom of the ninth, he singled home a 
run that beat Sacramento City, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It is unquestionably the highest compliment Kernen can give a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes in placing his best hitter in the leadoff position to maximize his 
number of at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Matador All-American Craig Clayton, one of the best players in Kernen's 
six years at Northridge, was a leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Gillespie, swinging the hottest bat on the team, was elevated to the 
leadoff position March 5. Gillespie's impression of life at the top of the 
order? 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I say no comment?" Gillespie said, laughing. "I don't mean to sound 
greedy, but hitting leadoff, you need a different type of mentality. I like 
driving in runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie, a freshman, has multiple hits in eight of the past 10 games. CAL

 Kingsmen Go All Out 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsmen Coach Mike Dunlap was not surprised that Greensboro lost a day after 
beating his Cal Lutheran team in the South-West sectional of the NCAA Division 
III basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap figured that the Pride was bound to be fatigued after defeating Cal 
Lutheran, 104-99, in a semifinal Friday. On Saturday, Greensboro lost to St. 
Thomas (Minn.), 84-74. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was as hard as I've seen (our) guys play," Dunlap said. "I mean, they 
were absolutely spent at the end of that game. . . . I figured Greensboro had 
to be tired. I knew they left their legs on the floor against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting statistics seem to back Dunlap's claim. Greensboro shot 45% from the 
field against St. Thomas after making 61.9% of its shots -- including 25 of 30 
in the second half -- against Cal Lutheran. JUNIOR COLLEGES

 Just Ask Dad 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he needed much help, but George Tarkanian, in his first year as 
basketball coach at Chaffey College, didn't have to go far for advice when his 
team played San Jose City in a quarterfinal game of the state championships 
eventually won by Long Beach City last week at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opposite end of the bench sat Jerry Tarkanian, the former Nevada Las 
Vegas coach and George's father. Jerry coached the South team against the North 
in an all-star game Saturday before the championship encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoyed having him there," Tarkanian said. "The San Jose City game 
(in the first round) was the first game he ever sat on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian, a former Antelope Valley assistant who still teaches political 
science twice a week at the Lancaster school, guided the Panthers to the 
Foothill Conference title. Chaffey finished 32-6. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the 80-mile commute to Lancaster from his home in Alta Loma, where 
Chaffey is located, made for some long days. But, apparently, he found time to 
mold the Panthers into a winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started playing better and better and we went much farther than I 
expected," Tarkanian said. 
</P>

 At least this time Lee Smelser didn't have to look for his car late at night 
or pay the piper once he found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Smelser, College of the Canyons men's basketball coach, attended the 
first-round games of the state championships last Thursday, and was impressed 
with the victories by the four South participants over their North opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised that the North wasn't a little stronger," Smelser said. "All 
their teams went home after the first day. That was a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 But not like the surprise Smelser had one night last season at the final eight 
tournament when he left the gym at the University of San Francisco to find his 
rental car gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out at 10:30 and the car had been towed," Smelser said. "I had to pay 
over $100 to get it back. I was wondering why there were so many (open) parking 
spaces on the street. That's why." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, a police officer on duty at the basketball game helped Smelser locate 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
 At Irvine last week, Smelser paid $3 to park next to the school's Bren Events 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to make another mistake like that," he said, laughing. Around 
the Campuses . . .

 * UCLA teammates Marcus Reed and John Sommers were not elite track and field 
athletes during their high school days at Canoga Park and Agoura, respectively, 
but they have developed into top-flight collegians for the Bruins. Reed, who 
had a high school best of 10.99 seconds in the 100 meters, finished third in 
the 55-meter dash (6.21 seconds) in the NCAA indoor track championships at the 
Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis on Saturday. Sommers had a best of 14 feet 6 
inches in the pole vault at Agoura, but he cleared 17-4 1/2 to finish ninth in 
the NCAA indoor meet, and raised his personal best to 17-8 earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * The black-and-blue award goes to Northridge third baseman Tyler Nelson, who 
through Sunday had been hit by a pitch nine times. Nelson also had drawn a 
team-high 19 walks, one reason why his on-base percentage of .469 was tops on 
the team despite a so-so batting average of .261. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northridge's sweep of Hawaii over the weekend wasn't necessarily great news 
for the WAC's national reputation. Hawaii, which entered the series ranked 24th 
by Collegiate Baseball, was the only member of the 10-team conference appearing 
in the polls. The Rainbows dropped out this week, leaving the WAC without a 
ranked team.

 * The Master's College basketball team set school records for most victories 
(28), best field-goal percentage (51.0) and best free-throw percentage (75.7) 
in a season. The previous records were 23 victories, set by the 1991-92 squad, 
a 49.9 shooting percentage by the 1985-86 team, and a free-throw shooting 
percentage of 72.9 set by the 1977-78 team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emeka Okenwa concluded his career at Master's with 1,094 points, 638 
rebounds and a career shooting percentage of 58.1. His 17.4 scoring average 
ranks seventh on the school's career list and his 10.1 rebound average is 
sixth. His field-goal percentage is second behind Kelly Byrd, who hit 58.7% of 
his shots from 1983-86.

<P>
 * With a 32-point performance against Greensboro, Damon Ridley became a member 
of the 1,000-point club at Cal Lutheran. Ridley, the team's leading scorer for 
the past two seasons, totaled 1,001 points during his two years at the school, 
and ranks 16th on the career scoring list. He averaged 15.7 points as a junior 
and 20.6 this season.

CITY HALL NEWS; EL MONTE; POLICE TRY TO OUST MAYOR WHO OPPOSED BEEFING UP FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Monte police officers are going door-to-door in a citywide search for votes 
to oust the mayor in the April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ballot with three candidates for mayor and six candidates for two seats 
on the five-member City Council (which includes the mayor), the crowded 
political agenda is dominated by the El Monte Police Officer's Assn.'s attempt 
to remove Mayor Patricia A. Wallach from office. 
</P>
<P>
 "An election campaign of intimidation and fear is being waged in this city by 
the police officers' association," said the embattled mayor. "People are scared 
to tell the police they can't put a sign (for Wallach's opponents) in their 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Of two slates for the three offices in El Monte, a city of 106,000 residents, 
one is endorsed and financially supported by the police union, which has 
donated $3,600 to the three candidates collectively, as well as untold hours of 
volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 The other slate consists of Wallach and two of her supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle is Councilman Ernest G. Gutierrez, who is bidding to 
become El Monte's first Latino mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The power struggle between Wallach and the association stems from the mayor's 
opposition last year to hiring 10 more police officers and to raising the 
utility tax from 3% to 7% to maintain the public safety budget. Both measures 
were approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mayor Wallach has consistently voted against public safety," said George 
Hopkins, association president. He said the mayor knew the city had among the 
lowest number of police officers for its population in the state when she 
rejected an increase in officers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The police association maintains that the average Police Department in 
California communities has 1.7 to 2.2 officers per 1,000 residents, and El 
Monte has barely 1 officer per 1,000. City officials consider the figures 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
 The association is campaigning for mayoral challenger Terry Keenan, 53, a 
sheriff's deputy and vice chairman of the planning commission, who deems 
himself a law-and-order candidate. "The city is like most cities in tight 
financial straits, but we've got to have safe streets," Keenan said. He said 
that he will try to unify the divided council and that although he is backed by 
the police, they will get no favors from him. 
</P>
<P>
 Running with Keenan are council incumbents Marie F. Avila and Jack Thurston. 
Both council members voted for the tax hike and for increasing the number of 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the tail wagging the dog," said Wallach, contending that police 
officers are trying to run City Hall instead of the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the association paid for a billboard proclaiming that Wallach was 
endangering public safety and for a newspaper advertisement seeking candidates 
to challenge her.  
</P>
<P>
 Wallach said she wants a utility tax for public safety put on the ballot. She 
did not vote for extra police officers because the city cannot afford them, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's slate includes civil engineer Gregory B. Griffith and planning 
commission Chairman George Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the mayoral race: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gutierrez, 59, is a three-term councilman and school administrator. He 
favors a balanced budget, attracting major retail stores, and cutting the 
number of liquor licenses, to make El Monte safer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keenan, 53, is a 25-year sheriff's deputy, planning commissioner and 33-year 
resident. He promises tougher law enforcement and more city planning, and to 
attract businesses. He hosts a cable television show. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wallach, 56, is a school instruction aide in a local school district and a 
nine-year local school board member. She vows to oppose additional taxes, favor 
growth projects and bring accountability to City Hall. Her husband, Edwin, is 
on the Mountain View school board, which includes El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the council candidates: 
</P>
<P>
 * Avila, 68, an incumbent, is ex-president of the local school board. She says 
police and fire protection are her top priorities, along with improving El 
Monte's image. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arthur G. Barrios, 43, is a barber and parks and recreation commissioner. A 
23-year resident, he promises to oppose the utility tax and higher license fees 
and be independent of political fights. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donato (Don) Garcia, 31, is a manager at the county executive's office. He 
is a lifelong resident who favors revitalizing the Valley Mall, attracting 
large retailers and building a rock 'n' roll theme park based on the city's 
role in its history. Garcia, an independent, maintains that Ritchie Valens and 
many other well-known early rock 'n' roll artists performed frequently in El 
Monte.  
</P>
<P>
 * Griffith, 37, is a civil engineer born and raised in the city. He opposes 
the utility tax, saying it is an obstacle to attracting new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thurston, 58, an incumbent, is general manager of a West Covina drapery 
store. He promises safer streets with a stronger law enforcement program, vows 
to fight the city bureaucracy and says he favors no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Williams, 47, is a carpenters union representative and chairman of the 
planning commission. He vows to seek new revenue sources other than taxes.

ARCADIA COUNCIL OKS LANDFILL; ENVIRONMENT: PANEL APPROVES PROPOSAL TO FILL IN 
AN OLD QUARRY. RESIDENTS OF ADJOINING EL MONTE NEIGHBORHOOD OBJECT TO THE PLAN 
AND VOW TO KEEP FIGHTING IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the protests of neighboring El Monte's city leaders and residents, the 
Arcadia City Council voted early Wednesday to allow a landfill in an old 
quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cities have struggled for 10 years over the landfill, which is barely 
connected to Arcadia but adjoins a residential neighborhood of El Monte that 
houses 5,000 people. The vote by Arcadia's council allows Rodeffer Investments 
Inc. to fill a tapped-out quarry, 85 acres by 165 feet deep, with 10 million 
cubic yards of dirt, gravel and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these rock quarries are eventually going to have to be filled," Arcadia's 
mayor pro tem, Dennis A. Lojeski, concluded after a public hearing that began 
Tuesday evening and ran into early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 people showed up at the council chambers to hear heated 
testimony from 40 people, mostly from El Monte, about the 60,000 truck trips 
that would be made during the landfill's 12-year lifetime. Speakers also voiced 
concerns about air pollution, noise and threats to ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere else in the San Gabriel Valley is a landfill operating so close to 
homes," El Monte Mayor Patricia A. Wallach said. After the Arcadia council 
vote, Wallach, citing fears over what could eventually get into the landfill, 
vowed her city would continue to fight it, but wouldn't say if that meant a 
lawsuit. The city wants the pit turned into a recreational lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Seymour, superintendent of El Monte City School District, said he feared 
for the health of students at four schools nearby because of possible air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a school nearby we have children so fragile . . . 26 children have severe 
breathing problems, 40 children are in wheelchairs, which causes problems with 
their lungs. . . . I surely wouldn't want to be responsible for hurting these 
children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Monte resident Mike Lopez complained about the noise the landfill would 
bring. "At its peak it will be 15 trucks an hour, six days a week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia officials and Marlene A. Fox, attorney for Rodeffer, said the city and 
the firm had taken many steps to mitigate the effects. Fox pointed out that the 
pit cannot be left in its present state; its walls are unstable, and it must be 
made reusable to comply with state and local laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodeffer would contract with Roadway Construction to run the landfill. Roadway 
takes away soil from construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
 A hydrologist hired by Rodeffer, Dennis Williams, dismissed concerns over 
ground-water pollution. He said the landfill would not even need to be lined 
because there would be nothing liquid to leak. "It won't even take asphalt," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Monte residents will get many other chances to challenge the landfill, 
which must win the approval of the state and local water quality boards, the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District, the California Integrated Waste 
Board and the county health department.

A JOB WHERE SUCCESS MEANS SORROW; FLOODS: CREW MEMBERS SEARCHING FOR A FATHER 
AND SON CAUGHT IN A FLASH FLOOD HAVE GRIEVED AS THEY WORKED. THE MAN'S BODY WAS 
FOUND TUESDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 For the past week and a half, every time the diesel revved and the blade 
lowered to take another chunk out of the mountain of mud that filled the Bailey 
Canyon Wilderness Park debris basin, all eyes focused on the bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversations stopped. Heads turned. Lungs dragged in cigarette smoke and held 
it, exhaling only when the blade lifted clear of the muck and the dozer rumbled 
back to gouge out another load of mud. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't necessarily mean everyone was ready Tuesday morning about 8 a.m., 
when county crews working the bulldozer unearthed the body of John Henderson, 
33, who disappeared with his 9-year-old son March 6 during a flash flood at the 
Sierra Madre park. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a long, painful vigil for the workers digging day after day in the 
mud in search of the bodies, knowing that success meant putting a tragic end on 
the story of a doting father who took the son he had raised alone since infancy 
for a Sunday walk in the park. Crews continued searching Wednesday for Matthew 
Henderson, who with his father was swept away by a vast wall of muddy water 
that tumbled through the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets really hard to keep your composure," said David Roth, a crewman last 
week on the 12 p.m. to 12 a.m. shift, as he leaned on one of the floodlights 
set up to provide light for night work and smoked a cigarette. "I really 
sympathize with the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, 25, said the pair's deaths affected him deeply because his girlfriend is 
a waitress at what was the Hendersons' favorite restaurant, a Coco's Family 
Restaurant in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knew Matt, she's been waiting on them for years," he said. "She's pretty 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
 After the flood, the boy's extended family came to the restaurant as usual, 
and included breakfast for Matthew in the order, he said. They left the boy's 
favorite breakfast meal, a grilled cheese sandwich, on the table when they 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers discussed how hard it was to tell their own 9- and 10-year-olds what 
Daddy was digging for at the debris basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids think I'm this big hero up here," said crew foreman Paul Turner. 
"It's hard to explain to them what I'm really doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old Turner, like many others on his crew, lives far away from the 
Sierra Madre work site. He has to drive home to Norco, near Corona, every 
night, and he can count on one hand the hours he sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner was visibly upset when Sierra Madre city officials informed him Monday 
that he would have to scale back his search for the bodies from 24 hours a day 
to 12 hours a day after neighbors complained about the noise from the dump 
trucks and heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite pleas from the Henderson family, who have kept vigil over the debris 
basin since John and Matthew were lost March 6, and statements from neighbors 
in support of letting the digging continue, Sierra Madre Mayor Clem Bartolai 
announced Monday that too many residents are bothered by the round-the-clock 
digging to allow it to go on. Crews were cut back to shifts from 6 a.m. to 6 
p.m., Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew member Jay Crosby just shook his head as he watched county coroner crews 
haul the remains of what family members believed to be John Henderson's body 
out of the mud Tuesday. His noon-to-midnight shift was forced to stop six hours 
early Monday night, and the body was found two hours into the morning shift 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have found him last night," he said. "We quit one shift too early."

DREAMS AREN'T DISCOUNTED AS OLD STORE IS REINCARNATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Asked to share her impressions of the new Pasadena Target, shopper Sara Hamel 
replied without hesitation: "It's the best thing that could happen to a dead 
Robinson's." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful . . . so much bigger than other Targets I've been in," said 
Hamel, a retiree who frequented the Colorado Boulevard building when it was a 
Robinson's department store. 
</P>
<P>
 Before accepting the realities of recession, some city and business leaders 
had hoped the 36-year-old building, set in Pasadena's Playhouse District, would 
be occupied with another department store that would draw the well-heeled. But 
those visionaries also saw fancy hotels and restaurants moving into the area, 
which continues to be plagued by vacancies even as the city's Old Town 
flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, business and city leaders are hailing the debut of discounter Target, 
which has employed about 250 people and promises to pump roughly $200,000 a 
year into local businesses for supplies and services. Some predict the store 
also will become the city's largest sales tax producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking to one happy camper," said Pasadena Chamber of Commerce 
President-elect Michael Hawkins, pointing out that some of the more then 10,000 
customers who attended Target's grand opening Sunday stopped by his Green 
Street Restaurant, two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business hasn't been this good in a long time, and I think others will 
benefit from the traffic Target will bring to this area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Target aside, the Playhouse District appears to be waking up: The 100-year-old 
Vroman's bookstore plans to expand from about 20,000 square feet to 35,000 
square feet. Vroman's president and majority owner, Joel Sheldon, is reportedly 
working on a deal to bring a 1,000-seat theater to property on the same block. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Theater Corp. of America, operator of the Pasadena Playhouse, is 
teaming up with the owners of Pasadena's Roxxi restaurant to open another 
eatery inside the Playhouse, to be called Critixx. 
</P>
<P>
 Target Pasadena opened its doors with a tidal wave of public relations hype. 
As a promotional stunt, Target delivered 10,000 roses to nearby households 
Friday. Hundreds of shoppers began lining up shortly after dawn, with lines 
wrapping around the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the new Pasadena store has a two-story shopping area and "upscale" 
features such as baked goods and gourmet coffee, Hawkins said many in town are 
feigning a French accent and calling the store "Tar-ZHAY" -- a pronunciation 
reminiscent of the "Jacques de la Carton" moniker some gave Jack-In-The-Box 
after that chain revised its menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, some of us might have been a little reluctant when we heard 'Here comes 
Target,' " Hawkins recalled. "But Target offers value, and everybody is looking 
for that. When you talk to the people who shop at Target, they cut through all 
lines of incomes, attitudes and race." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's exactly the kind of retailer downtown Pasadena needs, says Bill 
Reynolds, Pasadena's director of housing and development. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we trace back through Pasadena's history, we find downtown has been most 
successful when it has a variety of price points in merchandise, from very 
affordable to very expensive," he said. "We expect that store to generate about 
$400,000 a year in sales tax and we see it bringing tremendous amounts of 
traffic to support nearby specialty shops." 
</P>
<P>
 Target spent big bucks sprucing up its building, slapping on more than 7,000 
gallons of paint, sealer and stucco and pouring roughly $15 million into 
interior renovation. Much of that was spent on construction of eight jumbo 
elevators. Two are used to transport merchandise only and six can each carry 16 
shoppers and four shopping carts. The shiny, metallic boxes have mirrored 
ceilings and clear glass walls on one side, with doors opening in the front and 
rear. The store also has an escalator. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers interviewed Monday seemed generally impressed with the new store, but 
a few had gripes.

 "They're very impressive elevators but I didn't come here for elevators," said 
Cheri Koush, 29, of Pasadena. "This story is impressive and it is big but I am 
not leaving happy. I couldn't find the kind of stuff I wanted to buy . . . and 
the aisles were too small -- I was always saying, 'Excuse me, excuse me 
please.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her disappointment, she still managed to spend $100 on cereal, 
crystal, glasses and other household goods.

 Pasadena resident Marcelo Buchelli, a security officer, said, "The parking lot 
is too crammed and there was no one to manage all the traffic."

<P>
 But he gave the store's interior a positive review: "It's colorful and 
delightful -- the bathrooms are clean."

COMMUNITY NEWS: GLENDORA; CITY APPEALS RULING ON RAZING OF BUNGALOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Glendora is appealing a December, 1993, ruling by a Superior Court 
judge that found the city guilty of illegally razing an 83-year-old home that 
should have been saved and placed on the California Register of Historical 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding a lawsuit brought against the city by the Glendora Preservation 
Foundation, Judge Diane Wayne ruled that city officials had not performed 
adequate environmental impact studies before demolishing the Craftsman bungalow 
to make way for a City Hall parking lot.

TOPICS / HEALTH; CITY OF HOPE NURSES OK 3-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Registered nurses at the City of Hope National Medical Center have voted to 
ratify a three-year contract after having gone nine months without one. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bitter two-week strike in June, about 80% of the Duarte hospital's 430 
nurses walked off the job after contract negotiations collapsed.The strike was 
the first in the hospital's 80-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract is virtually the same one that was offered before the strike, 
hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But nurses felt pressured to accept the contract because of the hospital's 
shaky employment future, which led to the layoffs of 40 nurses and 20 other 
employees this month, said Pat McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the California 
Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the three-year contract, if nurses do not receive at least a 3% raise in 
the second year and a 4% raise in the third year, the union retains the right 
to reopen negotiations.

TOPICS / TRANSPORTATION; STATE ASSAILS 710 ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A low-build alternative to extending the Long Beach Freeway (710) through 
South Pasadena using surface streets would force vehicles to drive farther, 
pollute more and add time to trips, according to a Caltrans report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was written for state transportation commissioners, who will make a 
final decision April 26 on the 6.2-mile extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The surface -street plan proposed by South Pasadena, which opposes the 
freeway, calls for one-way streets, extra buses and construction of light-rail 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the plan would cause vehicles each day to travel 
29,000 more miles, emit 6,000 more kilograms of carbon monoxide and stay on the 
road for an additional 85,000 hours, compared with the proposed freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in South Pasadena, which opposes the extension, disputed the 
report's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, Caltrans cooked the books," City Manager Kenneth C. Farfsing said. 
He said the report wrongly assumed the Blue Line would get no more travelers if 
the freeway were never built. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allowing the proponents of the freeway to analyze the alternative not 
surprisingly produced bogus results," Farfsing said. "It should have been done 
by an objective party. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena is fighting the extension because it would divide the city in 
half and destroy homes.

TOPICS / ENVIRONMENT; NEW FISHING REGULATIONS LET STATE AGENCY CAST A WIDER 
NET; RECREATION: LAW REQUIRES ANGLERS TO DISPLAY LICENSE ON UPPER BODY. FINE 
CAN BE UP TO $1,000 FOR NOT WEARING $25 PERMIT. 
</P>

<P>
 After dangling worms off the banks of Irwindale's Santa Fe Dam for two hours 
Saturday, fisherman Don Carroll still had an empty stringer. But he felt lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the Valinda resident had been caught by Department of Fish and 
Game warden Frank Milazzo, who noticed Carroll was angling without a state 
fishing license displayed on his upper body, as required by a state law that 
took effect March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll had a 1994 fishing license in his wallet and a reasonable attitude, so 
Milazzo decided to let him go with a warning rather than a ticket that would 
have shattered Carroll's lazy lakeside afternoon with a possible $1,000 fine or 
six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the law and from now on I'll go with it," said Carroll, 55. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several other fishermen Milazzo checked that day, Carroll said he hadn't 
gotten around to buying a plastic case to protect his fishing license while 
pinned to his torso. The law requires fishing licenses to be affixed to an 
angler's outer clothing at or above the waist. Many stick them on their shirts 
or fishing vests, if not their hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Though thankful he had skirted a potentially whopping fine, Carroll said the 
state's "wear-your-license rule" is "a big nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the way many avid fisherman see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Brent Hunsaker, whom Milazzo checked early last Saturday as Hunsaker 
hiked -- fishing pole in hand -- along the stream running through the Upper Big 
Tujunga Canyon near Colby Camp. Hunsaker proudly pointed out the license pinned 
to his fishing vest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should have had this law a long time ago," Hunsaker said. "It 
separates the poachers from the sportsmen. I saw some kid fishing without a 
license this morning. I asked him where it was and he took off running." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what we want to hear," Milazzo said after chatting with 
Hunsaker. "Most fishermen I've talked to this month are in favor of the new 
law. They know that, as licensed fishermen, they're paying for services for 
unlicensed people." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no set date to begin strict enforcement, but state game wardens will 
likely be less lenient in coming weeks, as the public has a chance to learn 
about the new law. More and more San Gabriel Valley anglers are dusting off 
their rods and reels this month as the Department of Fish and Game begins 
regular plants of rainbow trout in selected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the department stocks local lakes and streams with 100 or more 
pounds of rainbow trout about every other week between February and May. Most 
of the fish weigh one-third of a pound and measure 6 to 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Santa Fe Dam and Puddingstone Reservoir in San Dimas, the state 
plants rainbows in the stream running through the upper and lower Big Tujunga 
canyons, the Arroyo Seco and the east, west and north forks of the San Gabriel 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 During a six-hour shift last Saturday, Milazzo checked about 20 anglers 
fishing along the alder-lined shores of the Upper Big Tujunga stream, the 
Arroyo Seco and Santa Fe Dam. Of those, most wore their licenses, and a few had 
licenses in their wallets. Milazzo let them go with a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other fish and game wardens patrolling West San Gabriel fishing holes last 
Saturday cited three El Monte men caught fishing without licenses along the 
upper Arroyo Seco near the Switzers picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a license to fish in a little creek like this?" asked one. He had 
just tossed his line in the water when the wardens walked out from behind an 
oak tree across the stream. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man sighed when one of the wardens explained the potential fine for 
fishing without a $25 license: a minimum of $250 and a maximum of $1,000. The 
judge can add up to 170% for court costs.

 AZUSA: A man wielding a sawed-off shotgun stole an undetermined amount of cash 
from the Ranch Market at 150 W. 9th St. about 9 p.m. Sunday. The man stormed 
into the market waving the gun, ordered customers to the floor and ransacked 
the register, witnesses said. He fled in a blue Chevy pickup truck that was 
waiting for him in the parking lot. No arrests were made and no injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: Four robbers armed with handguns and an Uzi entered a jewelry store 
at 921 S. Baldwin Ave. at 5:10 p.m. last Thursday, bound four employees with 
tape, and escaped with more than $200,000 in jewelry and cash, police said. 
None of the employees were injured and no arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAREMONT: A partial human skeleton was unearthed by a transient in a field 
near the city's border with Upland, police reported. The transient, who lives 
in the field north of Baseline Road and east of Padua Avenue, discovered a 
human pelvis, a spinal column that appeared to have been sawed off near the 
head and a number of other bones about 10:15 a.m. last Thursday. The Los 
Angeles County coroner is investigating.  
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: A Long Beach exterminator survived multiple stab wounds during a 
carjacking early Thursday by pushing away from his attackers and running down a 
jogging track along the Arroyo Seco, police said. Matt Kohlwey, 22, left 
Islands Restaurant at 3533 E. Foothill Blvd. about 3 a.m. and was about to 
drive away when he was jumped by a group of men who forced him into the back of 
his pickup truck and drove to an area under the Colorado Street Bridge, police 
said. The men pulled Kohlwey out of the truck and stabbed him several times, 
puncturing at least one of his lungs, but he managed to run to a trail and 
escape. Kohlwey's truck was recovered intact about four hours later in 
northwest Pasadena, police said. He was listed in fair condition at Huntington 
Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: A 15-year-old was slain Tuesday night in a shooting at Cantera Street 
and Edgehill Drive, police said. Carlos Guzman was transported to Pomona Valley 
Hospital Medical Center after officers arrived at 9:20 p.m. Guzman died at the 
hospital shortly after arrival, police said. Witnesses told police they saw 
three or four men running from the scene to a waiting vehicle shortly after the 
shots were fired. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH PASADENA: A 19-year-old Arcadia man was the victim of a carjacking 
Tuesday night as he stood next to his 1985 Jeep Cherokee parked near Fair Oaks 
and Monterey avenues, police said. He said two men had approached him about 
9:30 p.m. and held a knife to his throat until he gave them the keys to his 
vehicle. No injuries were reported and no arrests have been made.

SCHOOS; CLASS LEARNS TECHNIQUES IN MEDIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Keppel High School students Tony Montes and Alma Mora glared at each 
other in mock anger across the table, as student mediator Cassandra Rodriguez 
settled into a seat between them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He slapped me," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw her talking to some guy, joking around. I didn't like that," Montes 
countered. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez cleared her throat and began explaining the rules of mediation: "I 
don't have the power to make any decision; you have to make it. I will not take 
sides. There's no name-calling or put-downs, no physical fighting, and no 
interrupting." 
</P>
<P>
 The classroom exercise was developed by students in a class on conflict 
resolution. By September, the 24 students will use their skills to intervene in 
a variety of real-life conflicts at their high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for the class was a spate of racially charged conflicts between 
Asian and Latino students at Mark Keppel a year ago. During two days of 
fighting, police arrested 12 students and confiscated seven knives and a loaded 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the course, students learn to calm tensions between classmates before 
they reach boiling point. Beyond intercultural conflicts, they'll handle 
boyfriend-girlfriend fights, sibling squabbles and eventually even 
student-teacher disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 English teacher Gabriella Manchester and history teacher Gissella Castro 
designed the class last fall, pooling material from the Anti-Defamation League 
and other sources. Hands-on training in conflict mediation is provided by the 
Martin Luther King Dispute Resolution Center. 
</P>
<P>
 About equally divided between Asians and Latinos, boys and girls, the class 
includes freshmen through seniors, honors students and special-education 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers throughout the school recommended students who could act as leaders 
-- but not only sports captains and student government members.  
</P>
<P>
 "We also chose some non-traditional leaders," Manchester said, including some 
who may be associated with gangs. "Kids who assert what teachers call a 
negative influence, but who nonetheless have great influence." 
</P>
<P>
 The students, earnest and enthusiastic, mix fluidly, as though the racial 
division that prompted the course doesn't exist behind the classroom door. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the training has given them insight into their own conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps you think about what you did wrong and what the other person did 
wrong," said junior Gloria Martinez. "Instead of yelling and getting mad it 
helps you think of what's really going on."

 BALDWIN PARK UNIFIED: Maria L. Tarango, a graduate of Baldwin Park High 
School, will return to the district as principal of Tracy Elementary School. 
Tarango holds bachelor's and master's degrees from Cal State L.A., attended 
Universidad Autonoma in Guadalajara, and has worked 15 years as a bilingual and 
resource teacher, assistant principal and principal in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 BASSETT UNIFIED: The school board will hold a series of workshops at school 
sites to explain next year's budget and gather parents' comments. The next 
meetings will be: Van Wig Elementary School 6 p.m. Wednesday; Edgewood Middle 
School, 6 p.m. March 30. 
</P>
<P>
 COVINA VALLEY UNIFIED: Construction has begun on Covina High School, the first 
of 14 Covina schools scheduled for modernization, including asbestos removal, 
new air conditioning, furniture, lab equipment and computers. Work will begin 
April 1 at Northview High School. The total budget is almost $20 million. 
</P>

 EL MONTE UNION: School officials hope to fund athletic facilities and other 
school improvements by installing six 50-by-50-foot billboards on school 
property along the Pomona Freeway, an investment they say could earn $600,000 
in advertising profits over five years. No cigarette or alcohol ads would be 
allowed, and one billboard would be reserved for high school announcements. 
Construction would require changes in zoning and city ordinances.

 POMONA UNIFIED: Sixth-graders at Emerson Middle School who were dismayed by 
recent natural disasters designed a "HOPE" stamp (Helping Our People 
Everywhere), which would cost a cent more than a regular stamp. The extra penny 
would benefit disaster relief efforts. Students hope the U.S. Postal Service 
will adopt it.

O.C. LOSES 25% OF ABUSE CALLS, PANEL FINDS

 One-fourth of the callers to the county's 24-hour child abuse hot line hung up 
last year after they got busy signals or were put on hold for as long as 40 
minutes while waiting to leave a complaint, according to a new report by the 
Orange County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study released Wednesday, grand jury officials reported that 11,591 of 
the 46,313 callers to the Orange County Child Abuse Registry between Jan. 1, 
1993, and Dec. 1, 1993, never got through. 
</P>
<P>
 James Cooper, chairman of the grand jury's Juvenile Services and Education 
Committee, which issued the report, said those figures are especially 
disturbing because each call represents a potential case of child abuse or 
neglect. Although some callers may try again if they are not immediately able 
to reach someone to file a complaint, he said, many others will not bother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't say that the children were harmed but, of course, the threat is 
there when you have that many calls that are not answered," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand Jury Report on Children's Services Registry was the culmination of a 
six-month study on the inner workings of the Orange County Child Abuse 
Registry. Administered by the Orange County Social Services Agency, the Child 
Abuse Registry provides a 24-hour hot line to field child abuse reports. 
</P>
<P>
 It also includes an Emergency Response Services section -- a team of social 
workers that is dispatched to investigate child abuse complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's Services Director Gene Howard said officials are aware of the 
problems with the hot line and have been working for the last several months to 
institute some of the grand jury's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the Child Abuse Registry has installed an alarm system that 
alerts a clerk whenever a caller has been on hold for five minutes, Howard 
said. When that happens, a clerk takes down the caller's name and number, and 
relays the information to a social worker, who calls back when time is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to move quickly," Howard said. "With child abuse cases, 
you're really dependent on people to call in and let you know what's out there, 
so we really need to minimize the calls that we lose." 
</P>
<P>
 In conducting the study, the members of the grand jury audited hot-line 
records, interviewed social workers and other staff members at the Child Abuse 
Registry and reviewed citizen complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee made several recommendations for improving hot-line efficiency, 
including hiring more staff to take complaints, increasing the number of 
telephone lines for calls and encouraging mandatory reporting agencies such as 
police departments to file complaints by facsimile machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the commendable dedication of social workers, the registry needs 
improvements in both technology and staffing to improve effectiveness and 
response to child abuse calls," the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials at the county Social Services Agency, the volume of 
calls that went unanswered reflects, in part, an alarming increase in the 
number of reported cases of child abuse in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the agency investigated 25,850 reports of child abuse countywide, 
compared to 36,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "There had been the feeling for a while that we'd reached the plateau -- we'd 
finally gotten the total number of calls that we'd ever get -- but that hasn't 
been the case," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he said, the number of telephone lines at the Child Abuse Registry has 
been increased from six to 10. Six more social workers are scheduled to be 
transferred from other areas within the agency's Children's Services division 
between now and April 11 to help staff the hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will increase the number of trained social workers taking complaints 
from 13 to 19. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Howard said, the irregularity of the call volume makes it difficult 
to predict staffing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could have an hour in a day where you might have 36 people trying to call 
and then another hour where you have nine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some child abuse advocates expressed concern that people who are not 
immediately able to get through to a social worker would change their mind 
about making a complaint -- potentially exposing a child to continued abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are tentative or a little bit nervous about it in the first place, it 
would certainly reduce the chance that they would call back," said Tim Bauer, 
vice president of Olive Crest, a nonprofit agency in Anaheim Hills that places 
abused children in foster care and group homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you're dealing with child abuse, you have a lot of emotional factors 
to consider. People know they're doing the right thing, but still it's 
something that they don't know a whole lot about and they'd rather not be 
involved."

MORE BRIDGES NEED RETROFITTING; HIGHWAYS: CALTRANS TELLS LEGISLATURE 1,000 MORE 
STRUCTURES, SOME IN O.C., REQUIRE EARTHQUAKE UPGRADING. THE FINDING COULD ADD 
$1 BILLION TO CONSTRUCTION BILL. 
</P>

<P>
 Two months after the Northridge earthquake prompted a re-evaluation of the 
safety of highway structures, transportation officials have determined that 
seismic strengthening will be needed on approximately 1,000 additional bridges, 
doubling the scope of the freeway retrofitting program and increasing costs by 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one-third of the costs will not be covered by a proposed $2-billion 
bond issue for earthquake-related repairs, and Caltrans will need to find other 
funding sources to pay for the rest of the retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels said this week that the new estimates 
were produced for lawmakers as they were fashioning the bond issue for 
earthquake recovery. Caltrans screened a sampling of 60 bridges to determine 
the vulnerability of 1,500 bridges to earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 He said engineers concluded that two-thirds of the 1,500 bridges need some 
form of seismic strengthening. Officials put the cost at about $1 million a 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a pretty good number. It's not a wild guess," said Van Loben 
Sels. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear what structures in Orange County would be added to the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the candidate projects will be in Orange County, but we don't know 
how many," said Jim Drago, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Until late last week, officials at the Business, Transportation and Housing 
Agency, which oversees Caltrans, had said it was unknown how many bridges would 
need strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in private meetings with legislators last Thursday and Friday, officials 
disclosed the magnitude of the retrofitting, angering some lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) 
charged that officials had known all along how many bridges would probably need 
retrofitting but withheld the information until they saw an opportunity to get 
additional funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disturbing pattern in Caltrans of suppressing information," said Kopp. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said they did not know how many of the 1,500 bridges needed 
fixing until they did the sampling. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency already is retrofitting 1,039 bridges statewide at an estimated 
cost of $750 million and hopes to complete the work by the end of 1995. Of 
those, 51 bridges are in Orange County. The money for those projects has been 
put aside in the State Transportation Improvement Program, financed primarily 
by gasoline tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional 1,500 bridges came from a list that included structures 
Caltrans had screened once and had decided needed a more thorough examination 
before a retrofitting decision could be made. The list also included bridges 
near the epicenter of the Northridge quake and those constructed in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, Caltrans officials had determined that these older bridges 
were strong enough to withstand earthquake forces, but that assumption was 
disproved when some of the structures failed in the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 While a complete review of the 1,500 bridges will not be finished until the 
end of June, Van Loben Sels said officials decided to prepare a cost estimate 
when it became apparent that bond issue money might be available to help pay 
for retrofitting. He said bridges from all the earthquake-prone areas of the 
state were sampled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bond thing came along and it seemed that we needed to strike while the 
opportunity was there and so we made the best estimate we could and I think 
it's a reasonable one," Van Loben Sels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp said the new figures raise questions about the financing of the 
retrofitting program. Besides the estimated $1-billion cost for strengthening 
the additional 1,000 structures, there is a $650-million price tag for 
retrofitting the state's toll bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Of this total of $1.65 billion, the bond issue will cover only $950 million. 
The Administration of Gov. Pete Wilson has said that other funding sources can 
make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loben Sels said the Clinton Administration has freed up some state funds 
for retrofitting by agreeing to pay $315 million toward earthquake repair costs 
from the 1989 Loma Prieta temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said the federal government is expected to come forth with an 
additional $200 million to cover other Loma Prieta costs and the costs of 
retrofitting bridges damaged by the Northridge quake. In addition, he said, 
state gasoline tax revenues will pay for $40 million of the toll bridge costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You add it all up and we're just short $100 million," he said, adding that 
Caltrans could probably make up that shortage with savings from other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp was skeptical. "We have no guarantee of federal funds and I don't think 
there's even a reasonable probability for these unjustified assumptions," he 
said. "We have insufficient funds and there ain't going to be enough money 
unless we have a gas tax (increase) next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said he 
also is concerned that the $950 million will not cover the cost of retrofitting 
all bridges that need strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loben Sels said the next group of bridges are going to be more costly to 
retrofit because many of them are complex structures with clustered columns and 
unique design details. In addition, he said, the retrofitting program is being 
accelerated and that is expected to cause contractors to submit higher bids. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may pay 10% more to get it done faster," he said. "We expect to tell 
contractors, 'We want you to work six days a week 10 hours a day' and you pay a 
premium for that weekend work." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson ordered the acceleration of the retrofitting projects after The Times 
reported that 80% of the bridges deemed seismically unsafe had not been 
strengthened. Also, lawmakers had introduced legislation that would have forced 
the state to speed up the retrofitting program.

WELFARE AID TO OLDER IMMIGRANTS IMPERILED; ENTITLEMENTS: ADMINISTRATION TASK 
FORCE'S PROPOSAL TO DENY SSI BENEFITS TO THOSE IN THE COUNTRY LEGALLY UNTIL 
THEY BECOME CITIZENS HAS SPARKED ANGRY PROTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking for money to pay for welfare reform, an Administration task force has 
touched off a struggle with immigration advocates by eyeing funds from a 
rapidly growing entitlement program that benefits elderly immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is considering a proposal to deny Supplemental Security Income 
benefits to elderly immigrants until they become citizens -- and immigrant 
groups are intensely resisting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be felt and perceived as a xenophobic attack," charged Cecilia 
Munoz, senior immigration policy analyst at the National Council of La Raza, a 
Latino advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Little Saigon section of Westminster -- the cultural capital for the 
largest Vietnamese settlement outside Vietnam -- the economic threat has 
galvanized immigrants, whose angry protests have been crackling over the 
airwaves of Little Saigon radio for the past two weeks. More than 9,000 people 
streamed through the shopping mall office of the Vietnamese Community of 
Southern California to sign petitions challenging the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials involved in the welfare reform effort and other 
analysts said that the dramatic increase in the number of elderly immigrants 
retiring with SSI benefits over the last decade raises legitimate questions 
about whether the ultimate responsibility for their support should rest with 
the government -- or with the children who sponsored their admission into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle among groups traditionally allied with the Democrats illuminates 
the difficult choices facing the Administration's welfare reform task force as 
it seeks the money to pay for its plan through cuts in other programs. The 
Administration estimates that welfare reform could cost as much as $6 billion 
annually by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important, the battle over the SSI money opens a new front in the 
polarizing debate over government benefits for immigrants. Until now, Congress 
has fought over whether to deny illegal immigrants access to government 
programs. But the proposal under discussion in the Administration, and a far 
more sweeping plan put forward by House Republicans, would scale back aid to 
legal immigrants who have not yet become citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Some immigration experts said that they fear tying benefits to citizenship 
would impose an unprecedented form of second-class status on legal immigrants 
who have not become naturalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is an inappropriate linkage," Immigration and Naturalization 
Service Commissioner Doris M. Meissner said in an interview. "Our position as a 
country has been that with people who are here as lawful permanent residents 
you should, to the greatest extent possible, not make discriminatory 
distinctions between them and citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1974, the SSI program provides food stamps and monthly benefits of 
up to $446 for indigent individuals and $669 for couples who are blind or 
disabled, as well as elderly Americans who are not eligible for Social Security 
or who qualify only for very small benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are ineligible for SSI aid. But the program has become a 
major source of support for elderly legal immigrants who do not qualify for 
Social Security because they have never worked in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As overall immigration has increased over the last two decades, the number of 
legal non-citizen immigrants receiving SSI has surged from about 128,000 in 
1982 to 601,000 today. New applications for SSI from legal aliens are running 
at the rate of more than 150,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many legal immigrants receiving SSI are blind or disabled, government 
figures show that more than two-thirds are elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the rising number of immigrants receiving SSI benefits largely reflects 
the increase in elderly newcomers coming to the United States under an 
immigration law provision that entitles American citizens to bring their 
parents here. The number of immigrants entering the country to reunify with 
their children has increased from under 40,000 in 1985 to almost 65,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, immigrants arriving in the United States through family 
reunification provisions generally are ineligible for social welfare benefits 
for three years. During that period, the government takes into account the 
income and assets of the relatives who sponsored their admission. Except in 
cases of extreme poverty, the combined income usually exceeds the eligibility 
cut-off for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Congress temporarily extended that so-called "deeming" period from 
three to five years for the SSI program. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal under consideration by the Administration task force would extend 
the deeming period for SSI (and possibly other welfare programs, including Aid 
to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps) even further: until the 
new immigrants become citizens, a process that generally takes at least six or 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The contemplated change would affect only new arrivals, not those now 
receiving benefits. Refugees would be exempt from the restrictions and Medicaid 
eligibility would remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 By denying lawful immigrants access to SSI, AFDC and food stamps until they 
become citizens, the government would save $6 billion over five years, with the 
bulk of the savings a result of the changes in SSI, the Administration task 
force has calculated. Figures for restricting SSI alone were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant advocates maintained, however, that extending the ineligibility 
period for SSI would present immigrant families with an unfair choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "By proposing to cut essential benefits to elderly, blind and disabled 
immigrants, the Administration will put many families in the untenable position 
of having to choose between family reunification and poverty," almost two dozen 
immigrant rights groups wrote Clinton in late February. "Such a choice offends 
the basic values of this nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, immigrant advocates argued that, because relatively few elderly 
immigrants learn enough English and take the other steps required for 
citizenship, the change amounts to denying them retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have equal protection according to the Constitution," said Ban Bui, 
the president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California, which has 
organized a letter-writing campaign challenging the plan. "How can they have 
something different for the citizen and non-citizen?" 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has mobilized Vietnamese groups, which just a few weeks ago mounted 
a weak opposition campaign when it appeared obvious that the President was 
moving to lift the trade sanctions against Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cut benefits from those who cannot vote. They have no voice," said Nam 
Loc Nguyen, the director of the immigration and refugees department for 
Catholic Charities of Los Angeles, who has been traveling to various California 
cities to raise opposition. "We learned that lesson from the lifting of the 
trade embargo, so people are starting to realize how important it is to 
advocate for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the existing program questioned why U.S. taxpayers should support 
the retirement of elderly immigrants who have spent most or all of their 
working lives in another country. It would be more appropriate, these critics 
said, for those burdens to be borne by the children who sponsored their 
immigration to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that immigrants can bring in their parents to retire here, to incur 
expensive medical treatment, is a very troubling trend," said Dan Stein, 
executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group 
critical of high levels of immigration. "We can't allow people to bring their 
parents here from around the world to live and die at taxpayer expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Though immigrant rights groups promise a ferocious battle if the 
Administration proposes SSI cuts, even some legislative allies acknowledged 
that the groups face an inhospitable climate. 
</P>
<P>
 One measure of the current sentiment is a proposal put forward by House 
Republicans as part of their welfare reform plan. Under the GOP plan, all legal 
non-citizen immigrants, including those already in the country, would be denied 
access to all means-tested social welfare programs, including SSI, food stamps, 
AFDC, Medicaid (except for emergencies), school lunches and job training. Only 
refugees and aged legal immigrants who already have been in the country five 
years would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are offering them a choice: They have a choice of staying where they are 
or coming to the U.S. and not draining our services that they didn't contribute 
to," said Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, most observers said they consider it unlikely that Congress 
would approve such an extreme benefit reduction. But the existence of that 
proposal may make the Administration's plan seem more moderate and acceptable, 
even critics conceded. If the Administration proposed reducing access to SSI 
alone, Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) said, "my guess is that it . . . 
will pass."

WARNING OF TROOP PLAN IN GOLAN HEIGHTS; ISRAEL: IN AN INTERVIEW IN COSTA MESA, 
A WEST BANK SETTLEMENT LEADER CITES 'AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES' IN CLAIM THAT U.S., 
RUSSIAN SOLDIERS MAY BE USED TO GUARANTEE DEMILITARIZATION IF ISRAELIS 
WITHDRAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A leader of the West Bank settlement movement said Wednesday that a plan is 
being considered that would use U.S. and Russian troops to guarantee 
demilitarization of the Golan Heights after an Israeli withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Elyakim Haetzni, a former member of the Israeli Knesset, cited "authoritative 
sources" in making the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old attorney, now on a seven-day speaking tour of the United 
States, said in an interview that such a move could turn the strategic heights, 
once part of Syria, into an explosive flash point "where direct confrontation 
between the superpowers might occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the lobbying group Americans for a Safe Israel, Haetzni spoke 
Wednesday night in Irvine and was interviewed by The Times earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Haetzni, who served as a member of the Jewish municipal council of Kiryat 
Arba, said there also were plans to forcibly remove the 400 Jews living in the 
adjoining city of Hebron -- "to drag us out" -- within the next one to three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, Haetzni said, was part of a broader, U.S.-backed effort to lure PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat back to the peace table, after the massacre of 29 
Palestinians in a Hebron mosque on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why America should have a hand in such a foul deed I don't know," Haetzni 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin would 
be jeopardized if they tried to carry out such an action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day Jews are ousted forcibly from Hebron is the end of this government," 
Haetzni said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview broadcast on public television Wednesday night, Rabin said he 
would not rule out removing the settlers from Hebron, although such a move was 
not contemplated "at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 On PBS' "Charlie Rose Show," recorded earlier, Rabin noted that Hebron was 
populated by 100,000 Palestinians and about 400 Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the figures speak for themselves," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haetzni said he could think of few things worse than "being dragged out of 
Judea by an Israeli government." 
</P>
<P>
 "The events in . . . Hebron were terrible and should be severely condemned," 
Haetzni said, but it was "unconscionable" for Rabin to allow Arafat "to use the 
incident as an excuse for reopening the agreement previously made." 
</P>
<P>
 A secular Jew who was severely wounded during the siege of Jerusalem in 1948, 
Haetzni serves on the Council of Jewish Settlements for Judea, Samaria and 
Gaza, the umbrella organization that opposes the Mideast peace plan announced 
Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Haetzni said he and his organization unconditionally reject the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as some Israeli critics have demanded, the current plan is put to a 
national referendum and passes, it would be "no more acceptable" to him, 
Haetzni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented with any other peace plan that guaranteed "no terror and real peace" 
-- in exchange for abandoning some of the smaller Jewish settlements on the 
West Bank -- Haetzni said most Israeli voters "would sell us out."

DUCKS PULL THE PLUG ON KINGS; NHL: REVIVED POWER PLAY SPARKS 5-2 VICTORY. 
GRETZKY STUCK AT 799 GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So the rededicated Kings mustered all their resolve this week -- and managed 
to manhandle the NHL's worst team, the Ottawa Senators. 
</P>
<P>
 But one day after their mammoth positive-thinking session, the Kings were 
positively embarrassed Wednesday by the Mighty Ducks, who beat them for the 
first time, 5-2, in front of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Ducks aren't a harmless rival. They are the Kings' competition in 
pursuit of San Jose for the final Western Conference playoff spot, and by 
winning the Ducks crawled back into the thick of it. They trail eighth-place 
San Jose by four points -- though San Jose could easily regain the ground 
tonight, when the Sharks play Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last month, I haven't heard (the Kings) mention us as being ahead of 
them in the playoff race," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. "It's always been San 
Jose. Now hopefully we'll get their respect. They looked past us maybe. I think 
we've finally earned their respect." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings remain seven points back, but two games against San Jose this 
weekend could decide whether their playoff hopes are dead in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want me to say?" King Coach Barry Melrose said. "There are no 
excuses. I've never made excuses. We've got to make up seven points. If we 
don't beat (San Jose), that will make it tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Kings and Ducks played, Wayne Gretzky won the game almost 
single-handedly with an inspired five-point performance. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Gretzky was so ill with the flu that he vomited on the team bus the 
night before the game and was inhaling oxygen on the bench during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 He got no closer to Gordie Howe's all-time NHL record of 801 goals. No. 99 is 
still on 799. Gretzky made a game effort, putting five shots on goal and 
getting a breakaway opportunity called back for the second consecutive night, 
though he didn't get a shot off before the two-line pass was called. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, who've been dragging lately and tended to implode in the big games, 
suddenly found jump in legs Wilson thought were exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Sweeney scored two goals, and the Ducks got a spark from recently acquired 
center Stephan Lebeau and right wing John Lilley, who played for the U.S. 
Olympic team in Lillehammer and was making his NHL debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Also crucial was the play of backup goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov, whose recent 
sharpness earned him the start. He made 31 saves for his second NHL victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, though, was the suddenly revived Duck power play, which had 
recently dropped to last in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring on only three of their previous 63 chances with a man advantage, 
the Ducks scored three power-play goals against the Kings -- and turned a 1-1 
tie into a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on it the last couple of days," Sweeney said. "A couple of 
us finally said, the hell with it, let's make this thing work." 
</P>
<P>
 The puck movement was as crisp as it has been, and the playmaking was so alert 
it seemed as if different players were in the Ducks' uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tony Granato off for holding early in the second, Duck right wing Terry 
Yake faked a shot from the left side, then passed cleanly across the slot to 
defenseman David Williams, whose shot beat Kelly Hrudey at 3:22. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, with Alexei Zhitnik off for holding, Lebeau swooped in to knock home a 
loose rebound from the right side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings trailed, 3-1, after two periods but had to kill off the end of a 
Jari Kurri high-sticking penalty to start the third. They didn't do it, as 
Sweeney scored on a rebound 40 seconds into the period. That gave the Ducks a 
three-goal lead -- big enough to dig in defensively for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney added another goal in the third for a 5-1 lead, and it stood up 
despite a review that appeared to show him directing it in with his skate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Donnelly scored the Kings' second goal, but it was too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks started the scoring at 12:27 of the first period, after Lebeau sent 
Joe Sacco out on a breakaway with a perfect pass that the speedy Sacco picked 
up out front and converted. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the period was over, Robert Lang tied the score when he put a move on 
defenseman Mark Ferner in front of the Ducks' net and went around him to score. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came a series of undisciplined penalties by the Kings -- and 
surprising power play efficiency by the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've put ourselves in this predicament," Hrudey said. "We've used up every 
excuse. But I also still believe you always believe."

 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Olympic star Paul Kariya, whose contract talks with the Mighty Ducks 
remain stalled, said he doesn't feel compelled to join the NHL before the 
season ends. "It can wait," Kariya told Canadian Press from his family's home 
in North Vancouver, B.C. "(This is) the first chance I've really had to regroup 
and rest in two years. That has to be good for me. My body feels rested, not 
battered and bruised. I do not feel any necessity to play in the NHL right 
now." With the sides still millions apart on a multiyear deal, the next team 
Kariya plays with probably will be Team Canada at the World Championships in 
April in Italy. "If things do not get resolved, I would love to play in the 
World Championships, it would be redemption," said Kariya, who was stopped on a 
penalty shot in a shootout in the Olympic gold-medal game against Sweden. "I've 
gone over that penalty shot about 200 times in my mind." . . . Duck center 
Anatoli Semenov returned after missing the last seven games because of a sore 
elbow.

MORNING BRIEFING: NOT QUITE LIVE FROM N.Y., IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nancy Kerrigan's appearance on "Saturday Night Live" didn't impress critic 
Diane Werts of Newsday, but she says the problem might have been with the 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy Kerrigan's ice princess image apparently froze the writers of 'Saturday 
Night Live,' who provided little for the Olympic silver medalist to do during 
her heralded hosting stint," Werts wrote. "After her teary, self-pitying wallow 
on 'Dateline NBC,' the skater seemed poised to break her stiff stereotype. They 
quickly got Olympic rivals Oksana Baiul and Tonya Harding out of the way in the 
dull monologue. . . . One kernel of a glimmer of an idea would be repeated and 
re-presented and reiterated until you wanted to scream, 'Why me? Why anybody?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Add Kerrigan: "If Kerrigan didn't prove to be Ms. Personality, she was hardly 
the stiffest host 'SNL' has ever had," Werts continued. "That honor still 
belongs to hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotta be the skates." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What do Pasadena, Catalina Island, Havana, Mexico City, San 
Bernardino and the Canal Zone have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Name game: Bill Koch's proposed all-female America's Cup team has already been 
dubbed the Kochettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping hand: Only ballgirl Stephanie Flaherty gave Andre Agassi any trouble 
in a third-round match at the Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne, Fla., this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Flaherty, captain of her high school team in Miami Lakes, won a bogus point 
against Agassi after a frustrated Boris Becker asked her to replace him during 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her, 'Play another point. Maybe you are going to get a game,' " Becker 
said. "But she was too embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 So Becker returned, and Agassi completed his 6-2, 7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Add ballgirl: "She intimidated me out there," Agassi said. "I don't want any 
part of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Flaherty's reaction: "I called my mom. All of her friends had already called 
her at work and said, 'Look -- your daughter is on national TV!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rewarding failure: After posting a 1-16 record last year, the Mets' Anthony 
Young received a $25,000 raise to $230,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous game: Texas Ranger second baseman Doug Strange will miss up to three 
weeks of exhibition games because of a corneal abrasion in his right eye caused 
by suntan lotion seeping under a contact lens. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: All were once spring training sites for major league baseball 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Sailor Mike Elias of Long Beach, after going 2-16 against 
world-class competition in the Congressional Cup at Long Beach last week: "I'm 
getting ready for the America's Cup, too. I'm going down to buy a big-screen TV 
tonight." SHAV GLICK

 Matching an $11-million, four-year, no-trade contract offer to Tim Brown is 
what I would call a commitment to excellence. . . .

<P>
 What Big Dance? Students at Liberty, a.k.a. Jerry Falwell U., are not allowed 
to dance, but, nonetheless, the Flames will play North Carolina in the first 
round of the NCAA tournament Friday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fifth in a poll for tournament sleeper was Missouri, which happens to be 
seeded No. 1 in the West Regional. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin, which had the home-field advantage in the Rose Bowl, could have the 
home-court advantage in the West next week at the Sports Arena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harrick-coached UCLA teams are 4-1 in first-round games. The only loss was 
74-69 to Penn State in 1991. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is "in" to pick Michigan to win the championship, but maybe the Wolverines 
should be leery of Pepperdine. They have had problems with Southland schools in 
the tournament. Michigan had to rally to defeat UCLA in overtime, 86-84, last 
year and was crushed by Loyola Marymount, 149-115, in 1990. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Arizona was the Pacific 10 Conference's only team to shoot at least 70% from 
the free-throw line. . . .

<P>
 No wonder Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer dislikes USC Coach Cheryl Miller so 
much. Miller is tougher to beat than Marianne Stanley was during her tenure 
with the Trojans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most college scouts believe that Jerod Ward, not Felipe Lopez, is the nation's 
best high school prospect. Ward, a 6-foot-8 forward from Clinton, Miss., has 
not signed a letter of intent. He visited UCLA recently. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, with Dominique Wilkins, are a lot more exciting to watch than 
they were with Danny Manning. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How about the Clippers replacing Ron Harper with Harold Miner next season? . .

</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if Larry Bird replaces Dave Gavitt as general manager of 
the Boston Celtics. . . .

 Two national champions from last weekend's NCAA indoor track and field meet -- 
junior shot- putter John Godina and freshman high jumper Amy Acuff -- will lead 
the UCLA men and women against California and Texas on Saturday at Drake

<P>
 It might be a good idea to keep an eye on the runner-up in Sunday's $200,000 
San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita. Winners have gone to win the Kentucky Derby 
three times, but second-place San Felipe finishers have won four. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The favorite Sunday will be Brocco, who, according to jockey Gary Stevens, "is 
as good right now as he was before the Breeders' Cup." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Two-time winner Eddie Delahoussaye hasn't ridden in the Kentucky Derby since 
1988, but thinks enough of Argolid to ride the California-based 3-year-old 
gelding in the $300,000 Louisiana Derby on Saturday. . . .

 Ron Gant would be a great pickup for almost any team. Where else can you get a 
player who had 36 home runs and 117 runs batted in last season without giving 
up a player or draft choice? . . .

<P>
 Makato Suzuki, Seattle Mariner rookie, is wearing No. 96 because his fastball 
was timed at 96 m.p.h. Another pitcher, Bill Voiselle, wore No. 96 in the 1940s 
because he was from Ninety-Six, S.C. . . .

 Jaret Wright -- Katella High right-handed pitcher and son of Clyde Wright, a 
left-hander who once pitched a no-hitter for the Angels -- is ranked among the 
nation's 25 best high school prospects. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers ought to deal Carlos Hernandez, a promising catcher who is in the 
wrong place at the wrong time, for a left-handed relief pitcher. . . . 
</P>

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; FORMER WINNER OF OFFICE POOL OFFERS 
SECRETS TO SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a question that has befuddled civilizations, confounded the scholars, 
mystified the learned. It is a question that haunts us now more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you win an NCAA tournament office pool?  
</P>
<P>
 As a public service and for entertainment purposes only (no reason for the 
Feds to become involved, if you know what we mean), we offer the services of 
Utah Coach Rick Majerus. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus will be in Hutchinson, Kan., today, scouting players at the National 
Junior College Athletic Assn. tournament, but his heart will be at the NCAAs. 
Although his team failed to earn an NCAA tournament invitation, Majerus was 
chosen as handicapping expert for several important reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 --He has taken two schools (Ball State and Utah) to the NCAAs, guiding the 
Runnin' Utes to a Sweet 16 appearance in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 --He was an assistant coach on the 1977 Marquette NCAA championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 --He has won an office pool. MAJERUS SPEAKS, PART II 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' vision for office pool success revolves around a handful of basic 
basketball tenets. First and foremost is the theory of seeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeding is everything," Majerus said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Majerus, the West Regional is the weakest of the four brackets, 
which means No. 1-seeded Missouri, No. 2 Arizona, No. 3 Louisville and No. 4 
Syracuse "should have more of an opportunity" to advance than the top-seeded 
teams in the other more difficult regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 He is right, of course. Last year, the East Regional was considered the 
softest of the four brackets and sure enough, three of the top four (No. 1 
North Carolina, No. 2 Cincinnati and No. 4 Arkansas) advanced to the Sweet 16, 
the top two to the round of eight and the top one to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Again using last season's NCAA tournament field as an example, 10 of the teams 
seeded among the top four reached the Sweet 16. Seven advanced to the round of 
eight, four to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson: Longshots are nice in the early rounds, but when the going gets 
tough, the high-seeded teams get going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who picked Santa Clara over Arizona last year (the No. 2-seeded 
Wildcats lost to the No. 15 Broncos) should be on a street corner predicting 
Armageddon . . . and we should be listening to him," Majerus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus said to look carefully at styles of play. In tournament play, where 
preparation time is short, a different kind of team can create serious problems 
for an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kentucky . . . Temple, they play a brand of basketball that is in contrast to 
the norm," Majerus said. "They have a style of play that you're not accustomed 
to. Those are the kind of teams I look for. Not many teams play that way, so 
it's hard to emulate what Kentucky does (full-court pressure, up-tempo offense, 
lots of three-point shots) in a practice, preparation situation." 
</P>
<P>
 That would explain why Majerus is particularly bullish on Kentucky, Wisconsin 
Green Bay (very deliberate style), Western Kentucky (a Kentucky wanna-be), 
Southwestern Louisiana (more than 500 three-point attempts this season), 
Arkansas (offensive and defensive pressure) and North Carolina (two different 
kinds of inside attacks with the lumbering Eric Montross and the 
finesse-oriented Rasheed Wallace). 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus is an office-pool believer in teams that feature big and small. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at teams that have inside and outside strength," he said, immediately 
ruling out about two-thirds of the tournament field. 
</P>
<P>
 The big-small philosophy is why Majerus isn't so hot on teams such as Texas, 
Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, California--top heavy on guards, but no inside 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said this earlier in the season, the two best guards in the country are at 
Arizona," Majerus said of Damon Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves. "But (center Joe) 
Blair is kind of enigmatic at best, while (power forward Ray) Owes gives you 
what he has. And (6-foot-1 Reggie) Geary is a guard, not a (small forward), 
which is where they have him right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you have Cal. The best two-man punch in the game is (guard Jason) Kidd 
and (forward Lamond) Murray, but they don't have an inside game to speak of." 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite side is a team such as UCLA, which has a nice low-post weapon 
in center George Zidek, but no consistent outside threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what kills the kid at UCLA," Majerus said. "UCLA has no shooters. 
(Zidek) has pretty good low-post moves, but they don't have the shooters to 
take the (defensive) pressure off him." 
</P>
<P>
 Never underestimate the importance of momentum, Majerus said. Entering last 
year's tournament, George Washington, seeded No. 12, had won nine of its 
previous 13 games. The Colonials reached the Sweet 16. Temple, seeded No. 7, 
had won seven of its previous nine. The Owls reached the round of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exceptions. Majerus said Texas, which has finished extremely strong, 
has false momentum. Lots of victories, but against crummy competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Southwest Conference appears to be as weak as it looks," he said. "But 
then, our league (the Western Athletic Conference) is very mediocre. The Big 
West is very sub-par. You know, basketball in the West is just not as good as 
the East. Anyone who owns a television set can see that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it such a good idea to come bumbling and stumbling toward the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're coming in like Wisconsin (which staggered down the stretch), you're 
coming in and you're tentative," Majerus said. "Now is not the time to be 
tentative." 
</P>
<P>
 Other tentative candidates include UCLA, St. Louis, Indiana and Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' final tip deals with the great player. Under no circumstances, he 
said, should you fall for the Danny 
Manning-Did-It-At-Kansas-So-We-Can-Do-It-Too theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best player in college ball--and he'll also be the top player in the NBA 
draft--is Glenn Robinson," Majerus said. "But the one thing about Purdue is 
that they only have three guys who can score--Matt Waddell, Cuonzo Martin and 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think one guy can win you the Final Four," he said. "There are too 
many things you can do to one guy. You can box and one, have double teams 
running at him, whatever. I don't think (Purdue) has enough." MAJERUS SPEAKS, 
PART III 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the regionals. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 EAST--According to Majerus, No. 1-seeded North Carolina will advance to the 
Final Four despite Coach Dean Smith's reluctance to insert freshmen phenoms 
Jerry Stackhouse and Wallace into the starting rotation over seniors Kevin 
Salvadori and Brian Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what my theory is about North Carolina?" Majerus said. "I think 
they're trying to integrate two of the best young players in basketball into 
the lineup. I think Dean fights that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone says the kid at Maryland (Joe Smith) is the best freshman of the 
year. I will say he had the best year of the freshman. But the best player is 
Rasheed Wallace." 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' favorite for a first-round upset: Penn over Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' favorite if North Carolina falters: Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTHEAST--Majerus picks No. 3 Kentucky to earn a trip to Charlotte. "Because 
their style of play is so tough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' favorite for a first-round upset: No. 8-seeded Providence over No. 1 
Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' most overrated team: No. 2-seeded Duke. "I think Duke is a paper 
tiger," he said. "They've done it on the coaching of Mike Krzyzewski and 
they've done it on the shoulders of Grant Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 WEST--No. 3 Louisville's toughest game will come against No. 2 Arizona, 
Majerus said. Louisville will win and eventually win the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' favorite for an early round upset: No. 8 Cincinnati over No. 1 
Missouri in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' choice of most interesting first-round game: No. 5 Cal vs. No. 12 
Wisconsin Green Bay. "Different styles," Majerus said. "Kidd is a guard who 
wants to drive the car 90 miles an hour. The other kid (Green Bay's John 
Martinez) wants to get in the right lane, wants to take the senior-citizen 
lane." 
</P>
<P>
 His second choice: No. 4 Syracuse vs. No. 13 Hawaii. "Syracuse and Hawaii only 
have seven men who play," he said. "If Hawaii had nine, I'd take Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
 MIDWEST--A Final Four no-brainer. Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their talent level is tremendous," Majerus said. "They can kill you with 
scoring power and they also can get points off their defense. They pressure and 
they're very deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus on why No. 3 Michigan won't return to a third consecutive Final Four: 
"One thing about Michigan is that they've been there before. But I think (guard 
Jalen) Rose is too inconsistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' favorite for a first-round upset: No. 11 Western Kentucky over No. 6 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Majerus' thinking on No. 5 UCLA: Despite being placed in the same Oklahoma 
City subregional as Tulsa and Oklahoma State, "I think they got a great 
bracket," he said. Majerus is banking on two UCLA victories. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Majerus said there are eight teams that could win the NCAA title: 
North Carolina, Kentucky, Louisville, Arkansas, Purdue, Connecticut, 
Massachusetts and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 His championship-game pick: North Carolina over Arkansas. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's ranking as the nation's No. 1 team doesn't mean much come 
tournament time. Only one team in the last 10 years has finished No. 1 and then 
gone on to win the NCAA championship. It happened in 1992, when Duke defeated 
Michigan. . . . Best tournament rip: From Mark Blaudschun of the Boston Globe: 
"NCAA upset special? Arizona over Loyola." . . . Our final eight: Kentucky, 
Kansas, Connecticut, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Arkansas, Minnesota, 
Cincinnati. Final Four: Kentucky, North Carolina, Arkansas, Minnesota. 
Semifinals: Kentucky over North Carolina, Arkansas over Minnesota. Final: 
Arkansas over Kentucky. Top 10

<P>
 With the fastest dogs and a bit of guile, Martin Buser won his third Iditarod 
Trail Sled Dog Race in a record 10 days 13 hours 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his second victory in three years in the 1,100-mile race that started 
March 5 in Anchorage and ended in Nome shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Kaltag checkpoint, on the Yukon River about 250 miles from the finish, 
Buser said that he wanted to rest and wouldn't leave until 20 minutes after 
another of the eight-member front-running pack left. 
</P>
<P>
 The others knew Buser was the musher to worry most about and saw his stop as 
an opportunity to get some rest themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 While they dozed, Buser tiptoed out of the checkpoint and started driving for 
the coast last Friday, staying in front the rest of the way to earn $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Second was Rick Mackey, in 10:18:18. Third was defending champion Jeff King, 
more than eight hours behind. Basketball

 Houston Rocket guard Vernon Maxwell showed anything but remorse in a Houston 
court a day after his third arrest in 20 months. Maxwell was charged with 
illegally carrying a weapon in his car after being arrested and jailed for 
several hours Tuesday after a traffic incident near the arena where the Rockets 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston police said they confiscated a .380 semiautomatic pistol from the 
front seat of his car, and, in court, Maxwell stared at the arresting officer, 
H.D. Felder, and said: "Are you happy that you got on TV?" 
</P>
<P>
 Though prosecutors asked Court at Law Judge Sherman Ross to admonish Maxwell, 
he took no action, saying he didn't hear the remark. Golf

 Professional golf is investigating a report of purse-splitting in unofficial 
events on the Senior PGA Tour. No players were named and no tournaments 
identified in a statement issued by PGA Commissioner Deane Beman. 
</P>
<P>
 Purse-splitting is the prearranged sharing of purse money won by two or more 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficial events on the Senior PGA Tour include the Senior Skins Game, Senior 
Slam of Golf, the Chrysler Cup and the DuPont Cup Japan vs. U.S. matches.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: SCC SOFTBALL BUILDS ON LAST YEAR'S 
EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Southern California College softball team, which won its first Golden 
State Athletic Conference title last season, is showing signs that its success 
won't be fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by two strong pitchers, senior Beth Howard and junior Shannon Saylor, the 
Vanguards are 15-4 and 4-1 in conference. They will play Cal Baptist (20-1-1, 
4-0) for first place Monday in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-Coach Terry Zeigler believes the Vanguards have an advantage over most of 
their competition in the conference and NAIA District 3 because most teams 
don't have two outstanding pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, in her second season since transferring from Oregon State, is 8-1 with 
an 0.71 earned-run average. Saylor is 7-3 with a 1.15 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Azusa Pacific became the first team to score on Howard in seven 
games, ending a 42-inning scoreless streak in the first inning. Howard 
recovered to hold Azusa without a run until the international tiebreaker in the 
extra innings. The game ended in a 3-3 tie after nine innings because of 
darkness. It will be completed April 16 before a regularly scheduled 
double-header at SCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who walked only one batter every 11 innings during the regular season 
last year, has one walk in 69 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our offense can just keep up we should do well," Zeigler said. "I think we 
have the best pitching in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards have weathered the loss of Renee Hernandez, a catcher who was 
the District 3 player of the year. Hernandez dropped out of school in the fall 
because of personal problems and transferred to Chapman, where she is now the 
starting catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Lewis, a transfer from Rancho Santiago, has taken over at catcher and was 
batting .358 at the beginning of the week. Leadoff batter Shannon O'Rourke, 
also from Rancho Santiago, is playing shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Scofield, a senior from Costa Mesa High, was leading the team with a 
.434 average. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Borders watching: The media parade continues to stop for SCC baseball pitcher 
Ila Borders. Monday, it was the CBS' morning news show interviewing Borders 
Monday morning, live at 5:38 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Guillen, SCC sports information director, said Athletic Director Ron 
Prettyman arrived at 3 a.m. to help the CBS crew set up; Borders showed up in 
uniform at about 4:30. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was funny," Guillen said. "If you look at the interview, she's just 
standing there in the complete dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Borders is scheduled to be interviewed by Joe Garagiola for NBC's 
"Today" morning news show. Garagiola, a former major league catcher, is 
expected to play catch with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for Borders, a real game. Friday, she is scheduled to start at home 
against Whitman (Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman women's tennis team won its second match of the season last week, 
beating Caltech, 6-3. Sheryl Kalbach, Kristin Ross, Rebekah Anderson and Jolee 
Lautaret won in singles. Kalbach and Ross also won their doubles match. The 
Panthers (2-6) play at Cal Lutheran Saturday.

PREP NOTES: SEA KINGS HIRE FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Schuster has been named football coach at Corona del Mar High, Athletic 
Director Jerry Jelnick announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuster, 46, had been the football coach at Azusa High for the last nine 
years. During his tenure, Azusa reached the Southern Section playoffs six times 
and compiled a record of 61-33-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like his high school experience and his college experience," Jelnick said. 
"We did not know anything about him going in, but the people we contacted in 
that area had nothing but good things to say about him. They said he ran a 
first-class program and did a lot with not much talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuster takes over for Dave Holland, who resigned to take the defensive 
coordinator's job at Grossmont College. Holland guided the Sea Kings to two 
Southern Section titles in his 20 years as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuster will continue at Azusa the remainder of year, but will begin an 
afternoon commute Friday to begin gathering information about his new program. 
He will teach in the school's health sciences department. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuster lives in Diamond Bar with his three children, Craig, 20, a free 
safety at Azusa Pacific; Kristen, 19, and Traci, 16, who will attend Corona del 
Mar.

 El Toro's water polo team, the Southern Section Division I champions, 
announced that two of its players have signed national letters of intent. 
Brandon Stout, The Times Orange County player of the year, signed with UCLA, 
and Brent Stoll, a member of The Times' all-county second team, signed with 
George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin McIntyre, a South Coast League honorable mention pick from El Toro, will 
play water polo for Army.

CSUN FATTENS UP ON HARTFORD, 20-4; COLLEGE BASEBALL: HOWARD HITS FOR CYCLE, 
INCLUDING TWO HOMERS, AS MATADORS WIN FIFTH GAME IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Like blood drippings tend to attract attention in shark-infested waters, there 
was a feeding frenzy Wednesday at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 A rout of the first order was taking place and everybody wanted a piece of the 
action, if not a piece of the hapless Hartford pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a fight at the bat rack," outfielder Kevin Howard cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, then Howard won by TKO. He also laid a serious whipping on the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The score book will show that Northridge hammered Hartford, 20-4, in a 
nonconference game at Matador Field to chalk up its fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 That's only the official line. The secondary score was Howard 8, Hartford 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, a junior outfielder from Fresno, was five for five, hit for the cycle, 
slammed two homers and drove in eight runs to tie a school record. Scott 
Richardson (1992) and Shawn Noonan (1975) are the only other Matadors who 
accomplished the feat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was definitely due," said Howard, who raised his batting average 42 points 
to .283. 
</P>
<P>
 There might have been another entry in the record book, if not for a 
surprising development in the Matador dugout. Right-hander Jason Vargas, a 
junior transfer from Delta College in Stockton, had rolled up six superlative 
innings as Northridge rolled to an 11-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoot, hadn't given up a hit to hapless Hartford (0-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Kernen lifted Vargas (1-0) after the sixth, figuring Northridge 
(14-10) might need his relief help in this weekend's Western Athletic 
Conference series at Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen knew he would be second-guessed -- especially because Matador starting 
pitchers had completed their past four starts and 14 of their previous 23. 
Heck, if there is a Northridge hallmark, it is the complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I hated to take him out," Kernen said. "But I really need him to be 
ready for the weekend. I would have loved to have seen him do it, but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been one no-hitter in Northridge history, authored by Reggie Sells 
against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1981. Vargas, who gave up an unearned run 
in the sixth and threw only 67 pitches, took the news of his removal like a 
good soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever helps the team," he said. "I was happy to have contributed and I 
hope I can contribute over the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who assumed the team lead with five homers, belted a towering 
three-run blast down the line in left in the third to give Northridge a 6-0 
lead. He led off the fifth with a solo homer and Tyler Nelson followed suit to 
give the Matadors their first back-to-back blasts of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded to force in a run in the 
seventh and added a three-run triple in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three games, Howard has 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he keeps it up," Kernen said. "I hope this is indicative of how he's 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Make that going, going, gone.

VIACOM TO NAME JONATHAN DOLGEN NEW PARAMOUNT STUDIO HEAD; HOLLYWOOD: THE SONY 
PICTURES EXECUTIVE WILL OVERSEE MOVIE AND TV OPERATIONS IN A DEAL THAT IS 
EXPECTED TO BE ANNOUNCED TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran Hollywood executive Jonathan Dolgen has been named to head Paramount 
Pictures under a deal that will be formally announced today, sources close to 
the talks said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen will oversee movie and television operations at the studio under its 
new owner, Viacom Inc. Sources said he might also manage some of Viacom's 
existing entertainment operations. The Sony Pictures Entertainment executive 
was rumored to be on a short list of candidates for the job last week, but was 
believed to be locked into a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan J. Levine, Sony's chief operating officer, said the company agreed to 
release Dolgen from his contract late Tuesday, after he asked for the chance to 
take the new position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was a good opportunity for him, and it's something he really 
wanted to do," Levine said. "We didn't want to stand in his way." 
</P>
<P>
 The move puts Dolgen in a position of major authority at Paramount but also 
seems to undercut efforts to stabilize Sony, which has been wracked by 
management turnover in recent years. Levine said Executive Vice President Ken 
Lemberger will assume Dolgen's duties on an interim basis. News of Dolgen's 
departure created some friction on the Sony lot, where several other senior 
executives were said to be concerned about their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said he does not foresee other changes. Neither Dolgen nor Viacom could 
be reached for comment, but sources indicated that Dolgen will essentially fill 
the role that Paramount Communications Inc. President Stanley Jaffe played at 
the studio before his recent ouster. 
</P>
<P>
 That largely involves overseeing the activities of Paramount motion picture 
chief Sherry Lansing and TV head Kerry McCluggage, though one source said he 
might have an even broader entertainment title within Viacom. The long-term 
expectations for Lansing and McCluggage, who are both highly regarded within 
the industry, is unknown. Sources at Paramount said Lansing called a meeting of 
her staff late Wednesday to discuss the Dolgen move. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources first linked Dolgen to the Paramount job last week, after Viacom 
Chairman Sumner Redstone and President Frank Biondi held a series of meetings 
with top Hollywood executives. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Dolgen's name surfaced is that he and Biondi have worked together 
before. As a Columbia Pictures executive in the mid-1980s, Dolgen negotiated 
the sale of the studio's movies to HBO when Biondi was an executive there. The 
two later worked together at Columbia, under its former owner, Coca-Cola. 
Dolgen went on to work at 20th Century Fox, where he furthered his reputation 
as a tough-minded, sharp-witted executive with an incendiary temper. 
</P>
<P>
 He landed at Sony in 1991, where he mainly functioned as the cost-containment 
guru. Some creative people bristled at Dolgen's directives, but he steadily 
accumulated more authority. In November, Sony announced that its entire senior 
management team had extended their contracts. More recently, it said that 
Columbia Pictures Chairman Mark Canton and Dolgen had assumed new authority for 
running both Columbia and its sister studio, TriStar Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Dolgen's reputation for cost consciousness put him in good stead 
with Redstone and Biondi, who are committed to slashing expenses at the studio. 
Dolgen is expected to operate out of Los Angeles, even though Jaffe was based 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Others named as possible candidates for the job were Michael Fuchs, chairman 
of HBO; Jeff Sagansky, president of CBS Inc.'s entertainment unit, and Arthur 
R. Barron, chairman of Time Warner International. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer John Lippman contributed to this report.

FLOATING AN IDEA; ENTREPRENEUR HOPES TO BARGE WATER HERE IN BAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, Terry Spragg wanted to tow icebergs. 
</P>
<P>
 But technical problems prompted the Manhattan Beach real estate broker to 
regroup. What he really wanted, he decided, was to bring fresh water -- not ice 
-- to Southern California in his bid to cash in on the arid region's thirst. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later -- with interest among buyers slackening despite continued 
fears of drought and with critics jeering his water source -- Spragg is about 
to demonstrate water delivery by one of the most unorthodox schemes ever 
proposed: giant, waterproof bags, towed down the coastline by oceangoing tugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The bags -- half-size demonstration versions of bags that would each hold 
three times the volume of the Goodyear blimp -- will float at the ocean surface 
during a 20-day voyage in July. (Fresh water is lighter than salt water.) 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone asks me if this is crazy," Spragg says, "I tell them, 'You don't 
have to believe in me; I've surrounded myself with the best people in the 
world.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most experts say the technology is the least of Spragg's worries. The 
challenge, they say, is to make his prices competitive with those of other 
water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly isn't a crazy idea; I think it has merit," said Raymond Hart, 
chief of statewide planning for the California Department of Water Resources. 
"We get all kinds of ideas, and that's one of the few we've spent some time 
on."  
</P>
<P>
 Hart recently turned down a rival proposal to use seaborne bags to augment 
water supplies for the State Water Project. But he did so with the proviso that 
if water economics change, he will reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Spragg is winning few friends in the state of Washington, whose 
fresh water he wants to bring south. 
</P>
<P>
 An editorial in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer urged state officials to "pop" 
Spragg's "water balloons" after the newspaper learned that Spragg had applied 
for a permit to take water from Washington's Olympic Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The state can deny a permit for "southbound water-jacking," the editorial 
sneered, "if it can demonstrate some future need for the water right here at 
home. That shouldn't be hard, given our own vast expanse of thirsty desert, our 
choking Columbia River salmon and our growing population of former 
Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Spragg hopes to draw water from the outflow of an electric 
generating plant just before the water enters Puget Sound. Since not even fish 
use that water -- though it is perfectly potable, Spragg contends -- the state 
should have no jurisdiction over its export. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Washington does balk, he says, he will buy from Alaska, which for years 
has been trying to peddle its water to help replace sagging oil revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spragg's Bags," as they are known by some in the small world of water 
marketers, are the latest in a long line of arcane proposals to bring water to 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the others: a plan in the 1960s to carry water south from the Yukon by 
connecting a series of Western valleys called the Rocky Mountain trench, a 
scheme to haul Alaskan water in old oil tankers, and a proposal to build an 
undersea pipeline along the coastline from Alaska to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland officials don't doubt the need for new sources of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Means, director of resources for the Metropolitan Water District -- the 
water wholesaler that supplies 15 million customers from Ventura County to the 
U.S.-Mexico border -- estimates that Southern California will need a third more 
water annually within two decades.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of that will probably come from farmers, who in growing numbers are 
willing to sell their federally subsidized water to cities. Other water 
managers are betting on desalination and water reclamation. But Means, for one, 
believes that even exotic technologies such as Spragg's could find buyers in 
such niche markets as coastal cities of 50,000 or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might have some application in smaller communities that are growing and 
have reached the limits of their own local supplies and are facing expensive 
alternatives," Means said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the economics of water don't yet clearly favor such technologies, said 
Tony Willardson, associate director of the Western States Water Council, a 
quasi-governmental body in Salt Lake City that advises 17 western governors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wild card, though, is that no one knows what the future may bring," 
Willardson said. Indeed, amid renewed concerns about drought conditions, the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power raised retail water prices 9% last 
week to allow it to acquire extra water. 
</P>
<P>
 Water costs vary widely, depending on such factors as whether the water comes 
from a new or long-established source. Some districts pay only a few hundred 
dollars per acre-foot. (An acre-foot is one acre of water one foot deep -- 
roughly the amount used in a year by two families of five.) 
</P>
<P>
 Northern San Diego County pays as much as $700 an acre-foot at the tap. And 
water-parched Santa Barbara pays more, delivering water to customers at an 
average of $1,600 an acre-foot. It has made economic sense for the city to run 
its new $34-million desalination plant only for a brief three months since it 
was completed in 1992; at the moment, it costs $1,900 per acre-foot to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Spragg says he could deliver water in the range of $1,000 per acre-foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing magic about bags," said James A. Cran, who is promoting a 
similar ocean system. "They are tricky to engineer and awkward in operation, 
but they are very cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Cran, president of Medusa Corp. of Calgary, Canada, has successfully tested a 
bag with the volume of five supertankers. His first target market is the Middle 
East, where he is bidding to haul fresh water from Turkey to Israel and other 
nations now dependent on desalination plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Spragg is interested in the Mideast too. He is making four prototype bags for 
demonstration runs sometime in the next few months -- one down the Oregon and 
California coasts to Los Angeles, the other from Turkey to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is to gain credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he should demonstrate that it can be done," Means said. "Until 
someone demonstrates that they can tow one of these things down the coast, it 
has the air of implausibility, like icebergs." Fresh Water by Sea 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach entrepreneur Terry Spragg has developed a scheme to bring 
fresh water from Washington or Alaska to Southern California in immense, 
flexible, waterproof bags to be towed down the coastline by ocean-going 
tugboats. 
</P>
<P>
 HOW IT WOULD WORK: 
</P>
<P>
 The bags are 500 feet long and 50 feet wide. Each holds three times the volume 
of the Goodyear blimp -- 14 acre-feet of water, enough for 30 families for a 
year. Pipes would be used to fill the bags. Most likely, the water would come 
from a river or utility outflow just before the fresh water empties into the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Linked end-to-end in a miles-long string, as many as 50 bags are towed south 
along the coastline by a single tug. Like race cars "drafting" each other, drag 
is lowered by each bag following in the wake of those in front. 
</P>
<P>
 Since fresh water is lighter than seawater, the bags float just at the 
waterline, undulating with the swells. The tug pulls the bags at a leisurely 2 
to 4 knots in a 20-day trip from Washington state to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the Southern California shoreline, the water is stored in the bag or 
pumped ashore into a water district's treatment and distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT WATER COSTS 
</P>
<P>
 Cost per acre-foot, or 326,000 gallons; prices are wholesale, before 
distribution to consumers: 
</P>
<P>
 Big-city water districts, from all existing sources: $200 to $700 Water 
reclamation: $350 to $900 Water transferred from Central Valley farmland: $75 
to $175 Additional water from State Water Project, other sources: $400 to 
$1,100 Desalination: $1,200 to $2,000 Spragg ocean transfer from Washington 
state: $1,000 (est.)

EDISON GETS OK TO CUT RATE FOR MOBIL REFINERY; ENERGY: UTILITY SAYS CUSTOMERS 
WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE IF BIG INDUSTRIAL USERS LEFT TO PROCURE POWER ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In what could be a glimpse into a new world of deregulated electricity, the 
state Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a 25% cut in electric 
rates for Mobil Corp.'s Torrance refinery, allowing Southern California Edison 
to retain its biggest customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the impact of the Mobil deal -- or any single industrial discount -- on 
residential rates will be slight, advocates for residential users said the PUC 
should be making utility stockholders swallow the costs of such arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also say the consequences of big industrial users dropping out of 
utility systems could be far graver. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a remodeling and expansion, Mobil had planned to make its own 
electric power at a cogeneration plant that also would have produced the steam 
needed for refinery operations. Edison countered by proposing a discount rate 
for $700 million worth of power, and Mobil agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've done is keep our largest industrial customer in the system," said 
Bob Bridenbecker, Edison vice president of customer solutions. "This is the 
best of all possible circumstances for ratepayers." 
</P>
<P>
 As new federal and state rules allow big industrial customers more options for 
buying their electricity, Edison and other utilities say they must compete by 
lowering rates -- or else raise everyone's rates dramatically to pay their 
fixed costs when big users go elsewhere for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Though other customers will face a rate increase to make up for Mobil's 
discount, Edison and the PUC say that without Mobil, other ratepayers would 
have to bear $100 million to $180 million in fixed operating costs over the 
15-year life of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some costs that were being loaded onto Mobil's tariff rates will now have to 
be picked up by Edison's other customers, but it's a lot less than if Mobil had 
left Edison's system," said James Boothe, chief of staff in the PUC president's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial customers already pay generally lower rates than residential or 
smaller commercial customers, in part because it costs less to supply them. 
While an industrial customer may be able to take bulk electricity at 66,000 
volts, residential and commercial customers require current reductions, as well 
as all the associated transformers and power lines that distribute electricity 
house-to-house. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison charges residential users 12 cents a kilowatt hour; industrial users 
pay an average of 7 cents a kilowatt hour, with some industrial customers 
paying as little as 4 cents. Mobil's rate will drop from 6.8 cents to 5.1 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular deal is going to have an almost infinitesimal effect on 
ratepayer rates," said Robert Finkelstein, staff attorney at Toward Utility 
Rate Normalization, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group. "But on the 
larger scale, we think that if (utilities) are going to be giving these 
discounts, they ought to pay for them with shareholder money." 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest benefit of keeping big industrial users in a utility's system 
goes to the utility, not ratepayers, Finkelstein said, and so shareholders 
should make up the difference in fixed costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, since the late 1980s, when Atlantic Richfield Co. and other big 
industrial customers set up their own power plants, Edison has been fighting to 
keep customers on the system, Bridenbecker said, while the state's weak economy 
has reduced its business base.

BIG PAY HIKES FOUND AT AILING FIRM; DEFENSE: MANAGEMENT OF NONPROFIT AEROSPACE 
CORP. DEFENDS DOUBLE-DIGIT RAISES AT A TIME WHEN EMPLOYEES WERE BEING LAID OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo is severing employees and facing 
critics who want to slash its funding, Pentagon auditors have found that the 
company's top executives were given big pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent confidential audit, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, showed 
that the company gave pay raises averaging 22% for managers and 29% for the top 
dozen executives in a recent two-year period. The firm has laid off 860 
scientists, engineers and support staff members since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-page audit also asserted that senior executives billed U.S. taxpayers 
for home security systems, personal automobile use, child care, care for the 
elderly and for a generous retirement program that exceeded industry averages 
by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises and perquisites have sparked a controversy here that could not have 
come at a more awkward time for the company. Aerospace Corp. is facing tough 
questions about whether the Air Force can afford its services as federal 
budgets shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace Corp. asserts that the raises were necessary to bring management 
salaries in line with those of its competitors. The company also has persuaded 
Pentagon auditors to soften some of their original findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the firm is finding itself under an increasingly bright 
spotlight, as are other similar defense research organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace Corp. is one of 11 private nonprofit Pentagon contractors as 
federally funded research and development corporations, or FFRDCs. Others 
include Rand Corp., Mitre, the Institute for Defense Analysis and Lincoln 
Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since their creation in the early days of the Cold War, 
these organizations are having to justify their existence and defend what 
critics often regard as high costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace gets 97% of its funding, for which it does not have to compete, from 
the Air Force. Its work consists mainly of providing the engineering for all 
military satellite and launch systems, ranging from spy satellites to the Titan 
IV rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace Corp. is widely regarded as one of the government's top brain trusts 
-- a quarter of its technical staff have Ph.Ds. It currently has 3,571 
employees, and it posted 1993 revenue of $420.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon spending on such organizations has increased from $1 billion for 1985 
to about $1.4 billion for 1993, even as defense spending overall was dropping 
sharply, according to the Professional Services Council, a Washington trade 
association. For the current fiscal year, however, funding was cut to $1.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade group, which includes engineering contractors such as BDM 
International of McLean, Va., would like the Pentagon to open up competition 
for much of the work that the federally funded organizations are automatically 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
 The group alleges that the centers' costs are 50% higher than what they would 
charge. Such assertions and the growth of the centers' budgets at a time of 
cutbacks have prompted a tough look by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
has led an effort to clamp tight new spending controls on these organizations. 
The House Armed Services Committee has also sought to limit their funding. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rep. John Conyers, (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Government Operations 
Committee, has asked the General Accounting Office to investigate senior 
executive salaries at Aerospace, and also its recent hiring of retired Air 
Force officers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent Conyers committee hearing, it was disclosed that Aerospace charges 
the government an average of $181,000 a year for each of its scientists and 
engineers, far more than other contractors do for theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace, for its part, has tried to increase its political clout in 
Washington to fight what it sees as politically motivated efforts by Congress 
and private industry rivals to cut its funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace Chairman Pete Aldridge, a former Air Force secretary, said in a 
recent interview that congressional budget actions have forced the firm to cut 
employment 17% since 1990 -- more than other federally funded research centers 
have had to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has hired a savvy representative in Washington, Ronald Sable, 
whose former job was to keep the C-17 cargo jet alive for McDonnell Douglas. 
Aerospace has also enlarged its Washington staff and moved to large offices in 
Virginia overlooking the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldridge dismissed criticism of some who say Aerospace has outlived its 
usefulness, saying the firm remains crucial to national defense. He also said 
the average defense engineer in Los Angeles costs the government $200,000, a 
figure far higher than the average for Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you got rid of Aerospace Corp., you would have to re-create the same 
technology base as we have," he said. "Contractors say they have that ability, 
but they could never have the same . . . talent base across all of the 
technologies. We have a vision and a strategic plan to be the world's expert on 
space. We are a long way toward that." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, however, Pentagon auditors are more interested in Aldridge's pay. 
According to audit documents obtained by The Times, he received $265,000 in 
1992, up from $230,000 in 1991 and more than the $203,000 his predecessor got 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes more than the President of the United States," said Rep. Jane Harmon 
(D-Marina del Rey), a member of the House Armed Services Committee. "You have 
to ask, 'What is the appropriateness of something like this?' Those are big 
salaries at a time of severe cutbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon has previously championed Aerospace's cause, fending off a recent 
effort by Bingaman to impose budget ceilings. After she won that battle, 
however, she was outraged to learn that Aerospace was planning to move jobs out 
of her district to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon audit originally branded as "unreasonable" about $4 million in 
pay and benefits paid to executives and technical supervisors in 1993, though 
the disputed amount was cut in half recently after Aerospace executives and Air 
Force officials hotly protested the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon audit asserts that Aerospace executive benefits were twice the 
maximum the Pentagon considers reasonable. It also faults the company for not 
having official job descriptions for five senior executives. The job 
descriptions are used to determine whether salaries are appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written response to The Times, Aerospace defended the executive salary 
increases, saying the salaries had been so low that "they were jeopardizing the 
company's ability to attract and retain individuals with the talent, skill and 
experience necessary to meet our mission responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace also maintains that the raises were 10%, not 22%, a claim Pentagon 
auditors rejected. Aerospace also said its child-care and elderly-care programs 
are available to other employees. It acknowledged that a few executives 
received home security systems but said those were approved by Air Force 
contract officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Contract Audit Agency spokesman Phil Rogers acknowledged that auditors 
cut the disputed $4 million in half because Aerospace provided new industry 
surveys showing its compensation was not that far out of line. 
</P>
<P>
 But an auditor familiar with Aerospace's audit said the reduction was made 
only after senior Aerospace executives, aided by the Air Force, raised a stink. 
The audit agency then assigned two senior managers at its regional office to 
revise the audit and quell the uproar, the auditor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said such revisions are normal and that the agency was not coerced into 
toning down its report.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: GENETIC PROFILING COULD MAKE DNA VIOLENT CRIME'S 
WORST ENEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Three strikes, you're out" felony sentencing and Brady bill gun control may 
win the political popularity contests, but they're not the breakthroughs that 
will deter violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an innovation, however, that could have an enormous impact in 
identifying, capturing, convicting and deterring violent criminals. After a 
scandal arising from improper lab practices, this technology is now quietly but 
relentlessly moving through America's justice system. Where it's used, it 
works. Within a decade, every community that cares about fighting crime will 
revise its laws and build new databases accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Genetic profiling -- the use of biotechnology to identify the unique 
characteristics of an individual's DNA -- is about to become as prevalent as 
the Breathalyzer and more important than the fingerprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Genetic profiling used to be called genetic fingerprinting, but for reasons of 
technical precision and political correctness, the forensic criminologists 
opted for the kinder, gentler description of the technique. 
</P>
<P>
 With but a single hair, a dandruff flake, a skin sliver beneath the 
fingernails, a gobbet of spit or any other bodily fluid, crime lab 
investigators today can positively identify -- or completely clear -- a suspect 
based on the idiosyncrasies of that individual's DNA. 
</P>
<P>
 With polymerase chain-reaction technology, a Nobel Prize-winning technique 
that amplifies minute strands of DNA, "criminal investigators will soon be able 
to identify individuals off the butt of a cigarette they smoked," predicts 
Victor McKusick, the Johns Hopkins medical geneticist who chaired a National 
Academy of Sciences panel on forensic DNA matching. 
</P>
<P>
 McKusick's panel last year concluded that although gene profiling needs 
rigorous monitoring, it is a valid and reliable technology that should become a 
part of the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges today are no longer technical; instead they lie in taking the 
technology and building a meaningful legal infrastructure around it. That means 
that every violent felon in America (including juveniles) must be required to 
submit to DNA sampling -- a drop of blood or a saliva swab -- just as they are 
now required to submit to fingerprinting and mug shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Every state in the nation must be required to participate in the support of 
local and national DNA databases to quickly identify violent criminals. It 
should be a national crime policy goal that a police department anywhere in the 
country should be able to run a DNA match tomorrow as quickly, casually and 
cost-effectively as it can run a license plate check today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DNA technology is going to allow us to develop evidence for the courts, 
both the prosecution and the defense, far better than we have ever been able to 
do before," says Paul Ferrara, director of Virginia's Division of Forensic 
Science, which built one of the country's first gene-profiling facilities. "In 
fact, we're exonerating suspects in 25% to 30% of cases. . . . Even today, our 
police are much more aware of preservation of the crime scene. . . . The 
success rate we have going from the laboratory with evidence is going to 
increase dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, fewer than half the states have laws requiring DNA sampling from 
violent felons. Many of the states restrict sampling primarily to sexual 
assaults. What's more, states have only just begun to set up their own DNA 
databases to record criminal profiles. "Only about half a dozen states now have 
functioning databanks," Ferrara acknowledges. California and many other states 
have not moved nearly as quickly as they should have or could have to build 
their DNA databases. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, DNA database sharing between states is inadequate, although the 
FBI has taken a strong lead in facilitating standard-setting and cooperation 
with state labs for this emerging forensic technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the state databanks are being constructed using the same technology so 
that data can be exchanged between them," says John W. Hicks, director of the 
FBI's crime laboratory. "We're doing about 2,500 profiles a year right now. . . 
. In a few years, it should be in the tens of thousands." 
</P>
<P>
 The technology has already begun to pay off. Within the last six months, 
several states recorded their first "cold hits" off the databases. That is, by 
finding a DNA sample at the scene of the assault, investigators were able to 
match it with a DNA sequence already stored in the database. In cases involving 
sexual predators or child molesters, such DNA databases are indispensable. 
Hicks estimates there could be more than 20,000 profiles of sex offenders in 
digital DNA databases by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But when one considers how difficult it is for a criminal not to leave some 
organic trace of himself or herself at the scene of a violent crime -- or even 
an ordinary robbery -- it should be immediately clear that this technology 
radically increases the opportunities for criminal identification and capture. 
"In five years," says Ferrara, "databank hits should be commonplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The economics of these techniques are also favorable. Computer matching is 
cheap and, as biotechnology improves, the costs of DNA sampling could fall from 
roughly $200 a test today to less than $50 by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of justice and fairness, every effort must be taken to assure 
that these technologies are completely valid. It's unfortunate that there has 
been no technical coordination, for example, between the multibillion-dollar 
Human Genome Initiative and the forensic DNA programs of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Human Genome Project could be helpful in addressing some of the kinds of 
technical statistical issues that have come up in terms of populations," 
acknowledges the FBI's Hicks. "It could help do away with a lot of the polemics 
on how unique certain DNA sequences are." 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of forensic DNA is hardly a panacea for crime-weary Americans. On the 
other hand, it presents the most credible opportunity for stripping security 
and anonymity away from those who commit criminal acts. Criminal behavior may 
not be genetic. But criminals will be betrayed by their own DNA at the scene or 
on the weapon of a crime.

 Paint Manufacturer Fined: Sherwin-Williams Co. has agreed to pay a $1-million 
fine for failing to warn consumers that its Krylon spray paints contain the 
potentially harmful chemical toluene, officials said.The fine was imposed under 
a 1986 California law requiring warning labels on products made with chemicals 
known to cause cancer and birth defects. The state attorney general's office 
and As You Sow, a San Francisco-based environmental group, filed separate 
lawsuits last year in San Francisco Superior Court. As part of the settlement, 
Ace Hardware, DAP Products and Devcon will pay a combined $200,000 fine for 
carrying the product.

 Key Kemper Shareholders Support GE Bid: Key shareholders of Kemper Corp. said 
the company should sell out to General Electric Capital because other potential 
suitors probably won't top GE's best offer, expected by some to rise to $70 a 
share.GE Capital Services, the financial arm of General Electric Co., disclosed 
Monday that it had offered to pay $55 a share, or $2.35 billion, for Kemper. GE 
indicated it would be willing to consider a higher bid if Kemper would allow GE 
to examine its real estate portfolio, just one of Kemper's assets. Kemper 
characterized GE's offer as a "shocking assault" but said its directors will 
discuss it at their regular meeting today.

INFLATION REPORT COMES IN LIKE A LAMB; ECONOMY: THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR 
FEBRUARY GOES UP 0.3%. HOUSING STARTS MAKE A SLIGHT COMEBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the lingering effects of winter, there was little inflation and a 
slight rebound in housing starts last month, according to new government 
reports Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 0.3% in 
February, and the Commerce Department said housing starts for the month were up 
4.1%, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.31 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not get any further deceleration (in prices), but certainly growth is 
modest enough to prevent any serious pressures on prices," said economist 
Sandra Shaber of WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "I don't see any sign of 
significant inflation around." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York, agreed, 
saying: "Inflation remained well-contained in February. . . . Basically, there 
is almost no goods inflation in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts attributed much of the 0.3% increase in the Labor Department's 
consumer price index to winter-related fuel demands, which they said will 
dissipate with the spring thaws. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the increase in housing starts would have been even greater had it 
not been for storms and freezing weather that produced a 22% plunge in new 
construction in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost a lot of activity in January and February," said economist David F. 
Seiders of the National Assn. of Home Builders. "We should get that back within 
a couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Seiders maintained that housing starts reached their cyclical high in 
December, when they hit an annual rate of 1.61 million. However, he predicted 
that they will remain at a "healthy level" of 1.41 million this year, up from 
1.29 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department also reported that average weekly earnings, adjusted for 
inflation, fell 1.5% during February, the largest decline since a similar 1.5% 
decrease in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer price index did not rise at all in January -- the first month in 
more than four years that there was no increase -- and edged up at an annual 
rate of only 0.2% in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The February increase was led by a 1.6% surge in energy prices, including a 
7.2% jump in the cost of heating oil, the first since June and the largest 
since a 12.6% increase in October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Other energy-component increases included natural gas, up 1.5%; electricity, 
up 0.3%, and gasoline, up 1.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, food costs fell 0.3% in February following a 0.1% dip in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh vegetable prices plunged 4.9%, including a 26.6% drop for tomatoes. 
Prices for fresh fruits were down 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Beef costs declined 0.3% and poultry prices edged down 0.1%. Pork rose 1%.

 The trustees of the Grumman Corp. employee investment plan, which owns nearly 
a third of Grumman's stock, has hired advisers to evaluate the takeover offers 
made by Martin Marietta Corp. and Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The three trustees, all Grumman executives, said in a letter to employees that 
they "are required to act solely in the best interests of the (employee 
investment plan) participants and their beneficiaries." 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees explained that under state law, once a buyer has acquired at 
least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock, the buyer can 
require the remaining stockholders to sell. But even though the employee plan 
is the largest single shareholder, it holds less than a third of the 35-million 
outstanding Grumman shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes after Los Angeles-based Northrop offered $60 a share for 
Grumman stock, besting Martin Marietta's offer of $55 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees, who have retained the law firm of Whitman Breed Abbott & Morgan 
and investment banker Rothschild Inc., said they will decide whether to tender 
the plan's stock during the takeover bid or to allow the employees to make the 
choice.

PACIFIC BELL BLAZE POINTS UP SOME HIGH-TECH FLAWS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: WHILE 
NEW TECHNOLOGY IS IMPROVING THE PHONE SYSTEM OVERALL, IT ALSO RAISES THE STAKES 
WHEN PROBLEMS OCCUR. 
</P>

<P>
 While new technology is helping to improve the overall reliability of the 
nation's phone system, it can also lead to bigger problems when something goes 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 That was one of the troubling conclusions raised by telecommunications experts 
on Wednesday in the wake of Tuesday's fire at Pacific Bell's Bunker Hill 
facility in Los Angeles, which resulted in blocked calls and disrupted business 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In the annals of telecommunications blackouts, the Pacific Bell disaster was 
something of an anomaly. The majority of disruptions are caused by phone lines 
being physically damaged or dug up and by problems with new computer software 
installed in the networks without first working out the bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's disruption was caused by a fire that damaged power lines in the 
17-story building, leading to a major failure of a critical switch that served 
as the hub for millions of calls. The fire burned an area only about 50 square 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 While the concept of a telephone switching network hasn't changed much since 
the days when women operators on roller skates manually switched the circuits 
to route calls, the replacement of copper wires and analog switches with 
fiber-optic cables and digital switches has made for faster and more flexible 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in the newer "intelligent" fiber networks -- which Pacific Bell 
has begun to install -- the network can sense a break in the cable and 
instantly redirect calls to alternative switches. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommunications experts and regulatory officials said that new rules and 
rapidly improving technology has led to a decrease in the number of major 
service disruptions nationwide over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is good evidence now that we're better than we were a year ago," said 
Paul Henson, who heads a telephone network watchdog group appointed by the 
Federal Communications Commission in late 1992 after a series of serious 
outages disrupted service to millions of telephone users. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Henson's group recorded a total of 167 outages, each affecting more 
than 30,000 customers for more than 30 minutes. During the last three months of 
the year, phone companies reported 28 outages -- significantly fewer than in 
the previous reporting periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Henson said Pacific Bell, which reported 13 outages in 1993, one less than the 
previous year, had one of the best reliability records of the local phone 
companies. This year, Pacific Bell has had two outages -- Tuesday's and one 
resulting from January's Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the new technology has reduced outages, the disruptions that do 
occur can be more pronounced. For example, fiber cables can can carry thousands 
of times more data than copper wires. But since the traffic is concentrated in 
fewer pipelines, a damaged cable means a higher percentage of calls are 
disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, as the phone companies depend increasingly on computers to run 
their systems, they face the specter of software problems that are often 
difficult to pinpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's stuff that happens in the physical network and there's stuff that 
happens in cyberspace, and the stuff in cyberspace can be really, really hard 
to fix," said Denise Caruso, a San Francisco-based telecommunications analyst.  
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that officials are required by law to install sprinklers in 
high-rise buildings. But the use of water to extinguish fires on sensitive 
machines may cause more problems than it solves. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for problems could increase as regulators move toward allowing 
cable firms and long-distance carriers to compete against the local phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be entering an era in which reliability declines in the local market 
as competition based on cost intensifies," said Ryan James, director of the 
Boston-based Yankee Telecommunications Group, a consulting firm. "Fortunately, 
technology has a way of coming back to save us." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Pacific Bell officials said they hoped their evaluation of 
Tuesday's fire will reduce the chances of future catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan for various contingencies and this time we were caught without either 
primary or secondary power," said Bill Chubb, regional manager for Pacific 
Bell. "But it's premature to say the design is bad, before we understand 
exactly what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 John Seazholtz, vice president for technology at regional phone company Bell 
Atlantic, had his engineers reviewing power installation and maintenance 
procedures Wednesday morning after being briefed on the Pacific Bell disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're reviewing our power jobs, looking at what precautions vendors are 
taking, what training they have, whether additional criteria (should) be 
established," Seazholtz said.

GORE TO CALL FOR GLOBAL INFORMATION AGE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: AT CONFERENCE, 
VICE PRESIDENT WILL URGE FUNDING TO HELP DEVELOPING NATIONS BRIDGE ECONOMIC 
GAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At a key gathering the Clinton Administration is comparing to the 1992 Earth 
Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Vice President Al Gore will urge world leaders 
meeting in Argentina on Monday to develop a global information superhighway as 
a way to promote economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is the global agenda for telecommunications development for the next 
generation. At a time when the burgeoning telecommunications industry is 
expanding to serve consumers with groundbreaking new technologies such as 
high-definition television and wireless telecommunications, Gore and other top 
officials say they will call for a redeployment of international funding to 
close the technological gulf between industrialized and developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more telephones in Tokyo than there are in all of Africa," said 
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt, who is accompanying 
Gore. "Africa's inability to grow economically is directly related to its lack 
of a telecommunications infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, who will address officials from more than 100 nations at the World 
Telecommunications Development Conference of the International 
Telecommunications Union in Buenos Aires, would be the highest-ranking U.S. 
official ever to attend the quadrennial meeting of the ITU, which is the 
world's oldest international body. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's appearance at the conference is viewed by many observers as lending new 
prestige and urgency to this movement that languished during the George Bush 
Administration, which did not favor redeploying international funding for 
building communications networks in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, major international lending groups such as the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund have concentrated on helping nations finance crops, 
dams, roads and other basic needs. World Bank officials have said they are 
interested in funding more telecommunications development but must first 
develop the expertise to evaluate proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The ITU, which sets international telecommunications policy -- including use 
of the radio spectrum -- has no direct control over spending by its members, 
but its recommendations are influential. What's more, it could encourage 
members to reduce regulatory barriers in order to attract telecommunications 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore and Hundt argue that telecommunications development would promote 
political stability as well as help U.S. companies cash in on the more than 
$250 billion worth of telecommunications modernization that the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies estimates will be undertaken in the next 
decade in China, the former Soviet Union and developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development of a global information highway is critical to furthering 
education and economic development" around the world, said Gregory Simon, 
Gore's domestic policy adviser. An interactive global information superhighway 
is a "top priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, building an info highway in developing nations may be easier 
than in countries that already have communications networks. It is cheaper, for 
example, to install high-capacity fiber-optic cable than to replace ordinary 
copper wire, Hundt noted. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, wireless phone service is spreading in developing nations because 
of pent-up demand. In Poland, for example, more than 2.3 million people are 
waiting to get telephone service, up from 1 million in 1981, according to the 
Office of Technology Assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Gore's appearance will be tremendously well-received by developing 
nations," said Michael R. Gardner, a Washington lawyer who heads an industry- 
and government-funded program to train people from developing nations to 
provide communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to shift gears and stop paving highways to tourist towns in 
developing countries that have nobody there because there's no fax machine to 
take reservations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gardner said, an emphasis on telecommunications development may face 
some resistance from countries concerned about outside political and cultural 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
 France, for instance, has proposed barring foreign words from virtually all 
business and government communications. Similarly, Saudi Arabia has banned 
satellite dishes out of fear that foreign television programs may disturb the 
Saudi social order. And scores of countries have local-content rules that limit 
the amount of programming that radio stations and other broadcasting outlets 
may import from overseas.

 Pacific Gas & Electric Told to Give Back $115 Million: State regulators 
ordered the refund to customers to make up for "imprudent" gas purchases from 
the company's Canadian subsidiary between 1988 and 1990.The California Public 
Utilities Commission said the utility could have saved customers money if it 
had bargained more aggressively with Canadian suppliers or bought cheaper gas 
from other sources. PG&E, which plans to appeal, said it was disappointed by 
the ruling and said it showed that regulatory processes need to be overhauled. 
The company set aside a $61-million reserve last year, according to PG&E's 
annual report. A spokesman said he couldn't say immediately if earnings will be 
adversely affected.

 GM, UAW Reach Tentative Agreement: Union and management negotiators have 
reached a tentative agreement that could end the three-day strike at two Ohio 
brake-making plants owned by General Motors Corp. The strike by 3,000 workers 
at GM Delco Chassis Division plants in Dayton had begun to ripple through GM's 
factories, closing assembly plants in three states. The union had sought a 
company promise to build a new generation of brake parts in Dayton. But GM had 
proposed to hire an Australian company to make an aluminum part that would 
replace a cast-iron part made in Dayton, union officials said.

 Seagram May Squeeze Time Warner in Court: Seagram Co. may challenge Time 
Warner Inc.'s anti-takeover defenses in court but isn't likely to make a 
hostile bid soon for all of the New York-based media giant, investment bankers 
and analysts close to Seagram said.Chairman Edgar Bronfman and President Edgar 
Bronfman Jr. are interested in seats on Time Warner's board and want to 
pressure Time Warner into consenting, bankers said. The Bronfman family would 
also like the option to raise its 13.1% stake in Time Warner above the 15% 
ceiling imposed by Time Warner's board, sources said. A Seagram spokesman 
denied all of those rumors.

 NBC Leases Asian Satellite TV Channels: NBC, eager to break into the 
potentially lucrative Asian satellite TV market, has leased two channels on the 
new APSTAR-2 satellite, set for launch later this year.Tom Rogers, president of 
NBC Cable, said the network is developing a Pan-Asian CNBC business news 
channel in association with the Financial Times and Reuters in addition to an 
entertainment and news channel modeled after NBC's Super Channel satellite 
service in Europe. APSTAR-2 is the so-called hot bird that will carry other 
Pan-Asian networks such as ESPN. NBC is said to be spending about $40 million 
for the satellite lease.

 CalPERS to Loan $100 Million to Mid-Size Firms: The nation's largest public 
pension fund said the investment, to be managed by a Beverly Hills equity 
capital firm, is intended as the first step in a new investment program 
targeting state firms. The initial funds are expected to go to eight to 12 
companies in amounts ranging from $5 million to $20 million. The qualifying 
companies must have less than $250 million in annual revenue and be 
"fundamentally sound" but in need of capital that has not been forthcoming from 
lenders, said Jed Maxwell, principal investment officer for the pension fund.

 Lockheed-Russian Venture Gets New Order: Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia 
International, formed 18 months ago to provide commercial satellite launches 
using Russian-built Proton rockets, now has orders for nine launches valued at 
$600 million, LKEI officials said. The backlog includes a recent multi-launch 
order from SES, a French-based provider of television services, and a 
previously announced award from Loral Corp. of New York. LKEI called the SES 
contract "an extremely important win" because the venture's main rival is 
industry leader Arianespace of Europe.

BOND YIELDS PLUNGE AGAIN; SMALL STOCKS SOAR

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Another low inflation report sent bond yields tumbling for a second straight 
day Wednesday as buyers returned to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small stocks surged to new highs and the broad market also advanced, but the 
Dow industrials closed slightly lower. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The bond market rally that began Tuesday gathered a powerful head of steam 
with the release of the government's report of February consumer inflation, 
which showed another mild increase in prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, which sank from 6.95% Monday to 
6.87% on Tuesday, dropped sharply to 6.79% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the lowest yield in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter-term yields also tumbled. The yield on the three-month T-bill dropped 
from 3.65% to 3.60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates have been on the rise for much of this year, as bond traders 
have worried that the expanding economy would stoke inflation. But Wednesday's 
report of a 0.3% rise in consumer prices in February went along with Tuesday's 
news of a similarly low reading on wholesale inflation for the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of inflationary pressure has at least stemmed the recent heavy 
selling in bonds and has attracted some buyers to the market, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts caution that the market may be assuming that the low-inflation 
reports will keep the Federal Reserve Board from raising short-term interest 
rates again soon. In fact, experts say, there is a significant chance that the 
Fed will notch up rates when its policy-making committee meets Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed officials have argued that higher short-term rates are needed to moderate 
the economy's growth and keep inflation at bay, even if there are as yet no 
signs of serious price problems. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks paced the market's gains while blue chips languished. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the sharp decline in bond yields helped stoke investor optimism 
in the stock market, sending the Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks to a 
record high, up 2.25 points to 269.11. 
</P>
<P>
 Another index, the Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller stocks, jumped 5.47 
points to 798.99, just below its all-time high of 800.47. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials, by contrast, eased 1.44 points to 3,848.15 and remain 
well below their peak of 3,978.36. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market took a dive in February in response to rising interest rates. 
But even before yields began to retreat this week, investors had been returning 
to smaller stocks and ignoring many blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Dow stocks also suffered from late volatility related to the 
scheduled triple expiration Friday of key options and futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Another rally in technology issues helped buoy the small-stock market. 
Gainers included Dell Computer, up 7/8 to 27 1/4; Newbridge Networks, up 2 1/2 
to 62 1/2; Powersoft, up 4 1/4 to 62 1/2, and Peoplesoft, up 3 1/4 to 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Software stocks were in part reacting to the surprise announcement of a 
friendly merger between Adobe Systems and Aldus. Adobe, the buyer, fell 3 to 29 
1/2, but Aldus shot up 6 to 32 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * California Micro Devices soared 7 1/4 to 21 1/4. The company said Hitachi 
Metals will purchase a 10% stake in the firm in return for a licensing 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks rebounded, driven by falling interest rates. American 
Express gained 1 1/8 to 30 1/2, First Interstate jumped 3 3/8 to 72 7/8, Wells 
Fargo leaped 4 7/8 to 144 and Charles Schwab surged 1 5/8 to 31. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Los Angeles-based brokerage Jefferies Group rocketed 9 1/2 to 40 
1/8 after announcing that it will take its brokerage-technology unit public in 
a stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks gained as oil prices rose. Chevron jumped 1 3/4 to 89 3/4, 
Arco rose 1 5/8 to 99 1/8, Halliburton soared 1 5/8 to 32 1/8 and Amoco was up 
2 1/2 to 54 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nike ran up 3 to 57 1/2 after the athletic shoe giant issued an upbeat 
earnings forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed overseas. Tokyo's Nikkei average added 168.92 points to 
20,677.77 and Frankfurt's DAX index gained 7.14 points to 2,172.73, but 
London's FTSE-100 index dropped 24.5 points to 3,242.9. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the battered Bolsa index stabilized, adding 20.2 points to 
2,382.23. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * Near-term gold futures eased $2 to $384.90 on the Comex and silver lost 8.5 
cents to $5.38. 
</P>
<P>
 * Light, sweet crude oil for April rallied up 23 cents to $15.06 a barrel.

SEC TO TIGHTEN ADVISER RULES TO SHIELD INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday that it plans to tighten 
rules on investment advisers in an effort to increase consumer protections and 
loosen a congressional logjam that appears to be stalling pivotal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules would prohibit investment advisers from making unsuitable 
recommendations to their clients and would bar them from making investment 
decisions in client accounts unless the client is receiving periodic account 
statements directly from an independent custodian. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining the account statement rule, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt cited the 
case of Steven Wymer, a California investment adviser who defrauded his clients 
of more than $100 million by falsifying their account statements. If an 
independent custodian had been required to send statements to the clients 
rather than to Wymer, the fraud would have been quickly detected, Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC insiders hope the rules will shake loose a congressional logjam that is 
stalling far more pivotal reform. The quarterly statement and recommendation 
issues were items of contention between House and Senate conferees attempting 
to pass the Investment Adviser Act.

PUC KEEPS RENEWABLE-ENERGY BID PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that frustrated Southern California Edison Co., the state Public 
Utilities Commission refused Wednesday to set aside a procedure it established 
to guarantee producers of renewable energy a role in meeting the state's future 
power needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the agency proposed two relatively simple changes to its auction 
procedures, which have been contested by the state's utilities but are worth 
billions of dollars in contracts to producers of energy from wind, solar, 
geothermal or biomass sources. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to utility complaints that new electricity sources are not 
currently needed, the commissioners proposed deferring 25% of the purchases 
required of Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. under the auction rules 
until at least 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 In answer to complaints that some independent companies had skewed their bids 
in order to gain unfair returns, the commissioners proposed a cap on potential 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC set a 20-day comment period before the proposals become rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think (the cap) is a fair solution," said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive 
director of the Sacramento-based Independent Energy Producers Assn., which 
represents non-utility power generators.  
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the parties petitioned the PUC to amend the auction procedures 
in one way or another. But Edison had called for the most drastic solution, 
contending that its portion of the auction should be thrown out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise move Tuesday, the Rosemead-based utility made a separate deal to 
buy about 60% of the electricity required by the PUC from one of its bidders -- 
a deal the utility still wants the agency to accept in place of the open 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now at least, the PUC clearly has decided to keep the auction process 
basically intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still disappointed that we're having to go forward with this at all," 
said Don Fellows, Edison manager of non-utility power purchases.  
</P>
<P>
 The utility has estimated that the terms of the auction will add about $500 
million to ratepayers' bills over the next decade. The Independent Energy 
Producers say that according to Edison's own numbers, they believe ratepayers 
stand to gain by $500 million.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: UNC'S JONES KICKS UP HER HEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marion Jones is going on the record. She predicts North Carolina will win the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But her choice is not Dean Smith's squad, it is Sylvia Hatchell's Tar Heel 
women's team. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's team, the defending NCAA champion, carries a 27-6 record, the No. 1 
seeding in the East Regional and a No. 1 ranking by the Associated Press into 
its tournament. Jones laments that the women must vie for the public's eye with 
a program of such stature. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think it would be easier for us to get the publicity," Jones said, 
"because of the (attention brought by the) men." 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's women, meanwhile, are 28-2, seeded third in the East Regional 
and ranked fifth by AP. The women scored a first-round 101-53 victory over 
14th-ranked Georgia Southern on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes sense that Jones, a freshman from Thousand Oaks High and a 
national-class sprinter, has a vested interest in the women's team. She is the 
team's point guard.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Jones: "We have to work hard for the coverage we deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard work? How about victories in 17 of the past 18 games? How about Jones 
being thrust into a starting role five games into the season and rising to the 
challenge? 
</P>
<P>
 She is averaging 14.8 points a game, third highest on the team. She also is 
averaging 4.1 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 3.3 steals and is shooting a team-best 
54.3% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 No publicity? Well, then, how about a friendly on-campus rivalry? Tar Heels 
against Tar Heels for Chapel Hill bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be great to have both the men and women win national championships," 
said Jones, who scored 18 points against Georgia Southern. "But that's not 
what's motivating me, personally. But I'm not saying I wouldn't like to be 
wearing a T-shirt with both of our names on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident my team can win a national championship. But everything is do 
or die, and we've got to stay focused. Everybody we're playing now is either 
champions of their conference or second place in their conference. We're not 
playing any teams that don't know how to play ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Jones knows how to play ball. She's the only freshman starting for 
North Carolina. She also knows how to take her game to a higher level, which is 
crucial in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty much thrown into the starting point-guard position," she said. 
"I was a (shooting) guard at Thousand Oaks. I was more offensive-minded. I 
wasn't excited about (the position change) at first. But I think I have a 
point-guard mentality right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was used to taking it to the basket. But now I'm looking to read the floor 
and give it up to who has the best shot. I'm looked at as the leader on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 An uncommon role for a freshman. But with Jones running the floor -- and 
getting most of her points now from fast breaks caused by the Tar Heels' 
pressure defense -- North Carolina could be peaking at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels' average margin of victory in their eight victories since losing 
to Virginia in early February is 16.6 points. And in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference tournament final, North Carolina routed Virginia, 77-60, avenging 
its two defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 But floor-leader Jones won't take any credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much talent on this team," she said. "Just playing in practice, my 
defense has picked up, and on offense I've had to make changes in my game. I'm 
practicing against three or four of the best players in the country." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: Freshman Adam Jacobsen (Crescenta Valley) capped a 
successful debut season for Pacific with 18 points in an 82-78 loss to UC 
Irvine in the Big West tournament semifinals Saturday. Fifteen of his points 
came on three-point baskets. Jacobsen posted team season highs of six 
three-pointers in a game (against UC Santa Barbara) and a perfect night at the 
free-throw line (nine for nine against San Jose State). 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Eddie Hill (Cleveland) helped lead Washington State to an NCAA 
tournament berth with a 27-point performance against No. 16 California on 
Saturday. He had seven three-pointers in the victory, tying a personal high. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas point guard Dedan Thomas (Taft) closed out his three-year 
career ranked No. 4 on the Runnin' Rebels' all-time assist list (550) behind 
Greg Anthony (838), Danny Tarkanian (837) and Mark Wade (689). He also finished 
fifth in steals (153) and is one of only seven players in the 36-year history 
of UNLV basketball to rank in the top 10 in both steals and assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma City guard Kevin Franklin (Taft) helped the Chiefs earn a berth in 
the NAIA Division I tournament with a team-high scoring average of 15.1 points. 
He shot 46.6% from three-point range during the regular season, better than his 
overall field-goal percentage of 45.9%.

DIGEST: CLU'S SMITH PLANNING TO COMPETE ELSEWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Smith, one of the top reserves on the Cal Lutheran men's basketball team 
that compiled a 25-3 record this season, said Wednesday he plans to play 
elsewhere next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 6-foot-5 freshman swingman from Melbourne, Australia, who averaged 
9.0 points and 4.7 rebounds, said he is considering transferring to Westmont, a 
traditionally strong NAIA Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of it is due to financial considerations and some of it is due to the 
fact that (Mike Dunlap) will no longer be the coach at Cal Lu," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a new coach, the program is going to be in transition next season and I 
want to go to a program where things are already established." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, who guided Cal Lutheran to an 80-55 record from 1989 to 1994, will 
coach the Adelaide 36ers of Australia's National Basketball League starting 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, Cal Lutheran's sixth man at the start of the season, replaced guard 
Paul Tapp in the starting lineup from the sixth to the 11th games until 
sidelined by injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith averaged 13.0 points and 5.7 rebounds as a starter, but a bone chip on 
his left knee forced him to miss the first seven games of Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference play. He never returned to the starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent surgery to reattach the chipped bone Wednesday and is expected to 
be on crutches for the next three weeks. JOHN ORTEGA

BOYS' VOLLEYBALL / SEASON PREVIEW; SEBREE GOING TO COLLEGE ON FOOT OR ON HIS 
HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake High's Matt Sebree has achieved an unusual double-double. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not excelling as a punter and a kicker in football, or shining as a 
football player and a volleyball player, though both combinations are notable. 
Actually, Sebree's truly impressive double has been to attract interest from 
the Notre Dame football and UCLA volleyball programs, the most storied in each 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to (Notre Dame recruiting coordinator) Tony Yelovich and he said my 
leg looked really strong," Sebree said last week. "He said Coach (Lou) Holtz 
will be looking at it for a final analysis and will get back to me. It's pretty 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA volleyball Coach Al Scates also has invited him to walk on for the Bruins 
next season, Sebree said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame football and UCLA volleyball -- not bad for a skinny kid (6-foot-2, 
145 pounds) from a school known more for its academics. Actually, Sebree might 
not end up at either UCLA or Notre Dame. High-profile football programs such as 
USC, Penn State, Colorado, Washington, Wisconsin and Brigham Young have invited 
him to walk on as a punter/kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 In volleyball, he is being recruited by the top four teams -- UCLA, USC, BYU 
and Penn State -- in the latest national collegiate poll, as well as Ohio State 
and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Sebree is a multiskilled athlete (he has also played soccer for 
Harvard-Westlake as a freshman and grew up playing baseball and tennis), and 
his wide range of talents give him a leg up -- or is it the upper hand? After 
all, he uses both to great effect depending on the time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a weird combination," he said. "But I enjoy playing both." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, it's volleyball season, so Sebree is concentrating on hitting 
the ball rather than kicking it. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior outside hitter is a key player for the Wolverines, ranked second in 
the Southern Section Division I preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish he was on my team," Crespi Coach Kevin Slattum said of Sebree. "I 
think every great team needs a leader -- one main guy, and everyone else falls 
in line. He's that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sebree is actually only one of a talented trio of seniors -- along with setter 
Court Young and middle hitter Seth Rodsky -- who have played together on the 
Santa Monica Beach Club team and for Harvard-Westlake for the past three years. 
However, the team was hurt by the recent loss of the fourth member of that 
group, senior outside hitter Doug Park, who quit the squad March 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebree and his teammates still don't know why Park left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug quitting really, really hurt us," Sebree said. "All four of the guys -- 
me, Court, Seth and Doug -- are essential to our team doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Doug on the team, I would have told you that we had a legitimate shot, 
maybe two-to-one, of winning (a Southern Section title). Without him, I think 
it's going to be tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines found out just how much tougher when they lost a five-game 
match Tuesday to Mission League rival Loyola, but Harvard is still formidable. 
The Wolverines' strengths are passing, quickness and intelligent play, which 
happen to be Sebree's as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the purest passers in California right now," Harvard-Westlake 
Coach Jess Quiroz said. "And before a play develops, he's able to read it and 
position himself before it occurs. Not too many guys can do that. He reads the 
court and knows what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Sebree attended an invitational training camp in Colorado Springs 
for the top 36 junior players in the country. He was rated the top passer in 
the camp and had the highest vertical leap, 37 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's not a passive, cerebral student of the game who can't spike a bowl of 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how hard he can hit the ball," Crespi's Slattum said. "He really 
rips the ball. And he's an incredible defensive player. He's like a greyhound 
or a whippet." 
</P>
<P>
 His wiry strength served him well in football. He didn't play football as a 
sophomore, shared kicking duties as a junior and suddenly emerged as a prospect 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Most colleges are not offering him scholarship money in either sport, just a 
guaranteed slot as a walk-on or a chance to compete for the starting job with 
the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the reason is that I came on so late that a lot people didn't get to 
see me kick," he said. "But I feel that I can beat anyone out. I feel so strong 
and confident in my skills that I can say that." 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 37.9 yards a punt, routinely pounded the ball out of the end zone 
on kickoffs, and made six of six field goals and 24 of 26 extra points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the high school game for 27 years at several schools, and he's 
by far the best kicker I've had," Coach Dave Bennett said. "What he has going 
for him is that he's an outstanding athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's some latent talent there. If he fills out a little bit -- 
because he's a string bean right now -- he could be an outstanding prospect." 
</P>
<P>
 Sebree is unsure which sport he will play in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really depends on the situation when it comes down to it," he said. "If I 
go to a school with a strong football program and strong volleyball program and 
if both coaches say, 'It's OK, you can kick and play volleyball at the same 
time,' I'm all for that. I'd love to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 So which one does he like best? 
</P>
<P>
 "Football. . . . ahhhh, no, volleyball. To tell you truth, neither one is my 
best sport. It's baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Top area teams: 
</P>
<P>
 HARVARD-WESTLAKE 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 17-4 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Jess Quiroz, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines are the most highly regarded team in the area because a 
talented, experienced nucleus returns from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Court Young, Matt Sebree and Seth Rodsky have played together since 
eighth grade. Young (6-foot-2) is the setter and will pass to Sebree (6-2 
outside hitter) and Rodsky (6-4 1/2 middle blocker). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strength is our passing and our quickness," Quiroz said. "We're not a 
team that's going to go overpower people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines were hurt by the loss of senior Doug Park, who quit the team 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the lineup will be senior outside hitter Peter Kiefer, senior 
middle blocker Ryan Hudson and junior middle blocker Jay Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
 CANYON 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 16-3 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Ardyce Masters, 8th year 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys have eight returning seniors, making them one of the most 
experienced teams in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Brentt Phillips was an All-Foothill League selection last season. He 
will be joined by Jason Campbell and Marc McMillan, a pair of 6-1 outside 
hitters, 6-5 middle blocker Brian Lynn and senior setter Bryan Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's depth and experience has Masters excited about the Cowboys' 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've scrimmaged Harvard-Westlake and Royal, and we're as good as they are," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 ROYAL 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 21-1 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Bob Ferguson, 7th year 
</P>
<P>
 Royal graduated 11 seniors from last year's Southern Section Division II 
finalist, including five starters, three of whom earned NCAA Division I 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone returning starter is senior setter Adam White. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still competing for positions," Ferguson said. "Last year we were a set 
group. This year, it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Carlsen, a 6-5 junior middle blocker, is a definite NCAA Division I 
prospect, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be joined by 6-5 senior Garrison Chaffee, 6-2 junior Scott Hambly, 6-1 
junior Danny Rizzo and 6-2 senior Jerod Whiteley. 
</P>
<P>
 CRESPI 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 10-6 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Kevin Slattum, 8th year 
</P>
<P>
 The Celts' best player last year, Mike Lees, is redshirting at Cal State 
Northridge, so Crespi needs a new go-to guy. 
</P>
<P>
 It has one in Nick DiPasquale, a 6-3 senior outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nick is kind of stepping into that role," Slattum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting him are senior setter Tim Keller (6-3) and senior outside hitter 
Joe Bellavia (6-4), both starters last year. Middle blocker Christian Hunt 
(6-4) transferred from Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore outside hitter Mark Stipkovich saw action last year on the varsity. 
Brian Emerson (6-1 outside hitter) and Seamus McDonald (6-4 middle blocker) 
also will play. 
</P>
<P>
 THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 18-3 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: James Park, 4th year 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers advanced to the Southern Section Division I quarterfinals last 
year before losing to eventual champion Esperanza. Thousand Oaks' only other 
losses were to Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to top that," Park said. "But we should be pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the Lancers have height, and lots of it. Senior middle blockers 
Paul Brandt (6-11), Jason Hartman (6-7) and Steve Vlasic (6-4) are expected to 
put up a big block for opposing hitters to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
 Setter Bryant Edwards, and outside hitters Dave Sotolov and Mike Friel round 
out the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 13-1 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Tom Harp, 9th year 
</P>
<P>
 Harp has one of the best players in the region -- senior Mike DiSimone, a 
powerful 6-5 outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has as much power as anyone I've ever coached and he's moving the ball 
around when he hits," Harp said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally his first (college) choice is UCLA and if he keeps playing the way 
he has, he'll have a pretty good chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders advanced to the City Section 4-A Division semifinals last 
season but have only one other returning varsity player, setter Victor Chang, 
who was the team's backup setter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnest Yun (6-3) and Ryan Kamins (6-2) are middle blockers, and Mark Muir 
(5-10), Dan Elbert (6-0) and Irving Chen (5-11) are expected to see time at 
outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 VILLAGE CHRISTIAN 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: 17-2 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach: Steve Levoe, 3rd year 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of 16 players return from last year's Division III quarterfinalists, 
but Village Christian suffered a blow Monday when 6-3 junior setter David 
Ludwig broke his left arm during a match and will miss the remainder of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a really good-looking team until Dave got hurt," Levoe said. "With a 
little bit of work, we'll still be a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Brodie McClain and Steve Shaw will take Ludwig's place. Also starting are Chad 
Hanson and Kikko Banos and Mike Mitchell and Ryan Owens.

DEL TACO TO ANNOUNCE ITS CHAPTER 11 DAYS ARE OVER; FAST FOOD: THE ORANGE-BASED 
COMPANY WILL SEEK TO MORE THAN TRIPLE ITS MEXICAN-STYLE RESTAURANTS TO 1,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to become a bigger enchilada in Mexican fast food, Del Taco Inc. plans 
to announce today that it has emerged from bankruptcy with its senior managers 
having assumed ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which recently moved its headquarters from Costa Mesa to Orange, 
now expects to embark on a nationwide expansion aimed at more than tripling its 
restaurants to 1,000 by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "No longer are we merely positioning ourselves for growth," said Del Taco 
Chairman Kevin K. Moriarty, now majority owner of the privately held firm. 
"Today we redirect our sights on real, accelerated expansion through ambitious 
company and franchise growth across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Moriarty said Wednesday in an interview at the recently rehabilitated Del Taco 
eatery at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa that Taco Bell Inc., its much larger 
archrival, has created a national awareness of Mexican-style fast food. And 
unlike the crowded market of burger chains, Del Taco has a relatively open 
field in its bid to compete against Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Taco filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on March 29, 1993, 
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana. At that time, Moriarty said the company 
was profitable from operations, but was sagging under the weight of $87 million 
owed to General Electric Capital, its largest creditor and a 79% owner. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing gave Del Taco a chance to remove itself from some leases of 
unprofitable restaurants, said Executive Vice President Paul Hitzelberger. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Taco said it closed 21 restaurants, leaving more than 270 in the chain, 
and modified or rejected 93 leases since its filing. Moriarty and Hitzelberger 
led the management buyout, using their own money and borrowing from GE Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The company emerged from bankruptcy protection in December. Because it is 
privately held, Moriarty would not divulge how much of the new corporation he 
or the other officers own, or even the company's projected sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy documents show that in 1992, Del Taco earned $1 million in profit 
before taxes and interest on $124 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Moriarty said Del Taco has "a great balance sheet" and is making 
provisions for renovating company-owned stores, which make up more than half 
the chain. That is expected to cost about $30 million over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what it will take to challenge Irvine-based Taco Bell, the Pepsico 
unit with more than 4,500 restaurants nationwide. Though his chain is small 
when compared to its competitor, Moriarty likes to say that Del Taco is "the 
No. 2 Mexican restaurant chain in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 With sales of salsa having exceeded ketchup for the first time in 1993, 
Moriarty said the nation is ready for an alternative Mexican-style food chain. 
While Del Tacos are sprinkled in states as varied as Alabama, Missouri, New 
Hampshire, New York, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Illinois, South Carolina and 
Utah, the vast majority are in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Lowder, a restaurant consultant based in Rancho Palos Verdes, agreed 
that Del Taco has a strong chance to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California is the most concentrated market for Mexican food," Lowder 
said. "Once you get outside California or the Southwest, you will find Taco 
Bell . . . but there aren't a lot of choices for Mexican food."

BRIEFCASE: RETAIL AND RESTAURANTS; BABY-SITTER'S CLUB READERS CONVENE AT 
MAINPLACE MALL TO MEET AUTHOR ANN MARTIN 
</P>

<P>
 The preschool and grade-school set, with parents in tow, jammed the Anaheim 
Convention Center Saturday for a glimpse of television's popular Mighty Morphin 
Power Rangers action characters. 
</P>
<P>
 But over at MainPlace/Santa Ana, the star attraction was Ann M. Martin, author 
of the popular Baby-Sitter's Club series, which challenges the ever-popular 
Nancy Drew books as the favorite read among young girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin drew about 3,000 children and parents -- mainly daughters and mothers. 
"That rates very well for an author appearance at MainPlace," said MainPlace 
Marketing Director Judy Bijlani. Martin autographed books for young fans for 
four hours and posed for pictures with those who brought cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin also held a press conference for cub reporters from local junior high 
and intermediate schools. "It was really cute," Bijlani said. "The students all 
had their little pads and they'd prepared questions for Ann Martin. They asked 
about her background and what made her want to be an author." 
</P>
<P>
 Tired parents were invited to take advantage of MainPlace's innovative 
hospitality suite -- a renovated storefront that serves as a "big living room," 
Bijlani said. "There's a mother's nursing area, a children's play area, a 
restroom. People are invited to come in and really rest and relax." 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitality suite opened for the past holiday shopping season and proved 
popular enough to reopen later on a permanent basis.

1993 sales were lower due to the divestiture of two subsidiaries.

in recent months when he helped fast-food leader Carl N. Karcher to restructure 
his significant personal debts, has changed jobs.Puzder on Tuesday closed the 
door of his office with Lewis, D'Amato, Brisbois & Bisgaard in Costa Mesa. On 
Wednesday he set up shop in Newport Beach with Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & 
Rauth.

 Platinum Software Corp.: The Irvine firm said Wednesday that its directors had 
adopted a "poison pill" to ward off any hostile takeovers.The shareholder 
rights plan is "not a response to any specific effort to acquire control of the 
corporation," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the plan will be mailed to shareholders in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, poison pills involve issuing more stock to existing shareholders so 
that a company becomes prohibitively expensive for an outside shareholder, or 
raider, to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum is a leading provider of computer software for financial information 
systems.

 Watson General Corp.: The Irvine-based provider of environmental products and 
management services said Wednesday that it will join with a Santa Ana company 
to offer independent monitoring of underground leaks of gasoline and other 
petroleum tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said it has reached an exclusive agreement with alarm-maker National 
Alarm Computer Center to provide the software needed to qualify a National 
Alarm facility as a third-party monitoring station. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald G. Crane, Watson's president, said the company is trying to get into a 
new area in the early stages. Only the city of Santa Ana requires that service 
stations and others with underground petroleum tanks use third parties to 
monitor possible leaks. However, Crane said other cities and the state are 
looking at similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's software will allow National Alarm to use computers to check on 
alarms installed in every service station to determine if leaks have occurred.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CommerceBancorp, which has seen its stock price remain under $1 a share 
through February, said Wednesday that its stock no longer will be trading on 
the Nasdaq National Market computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, stock in the holding company for CommerceBank in Newport Beach 
will trade on Nasdaq's SmallCap Market, a system for companies with little 
capital or very low stock prices.The company's stock, which did not trade 
Wednesday, closed at $1 a share Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq required the switch because the company no longer met its national 
market system standards, which require, among other things, that stock prices 
be consistently above $1 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, operating under regulatory restrictions, is arranging to offer new 
stock to existing shareholders and the public to raise more capital, its last 
defense against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceBancorp had just enough capital at the end of December to avoid an 
order from bank regulators to correct its problems promptly or face a federal 
takeover. Dale E. Walter, the bank's president, said the bank expects to 
maintain its capital level through the first quarter, ending March 31.

Philadelphia when a young staff worker brought in a personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, he's on his own, teaching literacy and computer skills and 
earning money with free-lance desktop publishing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing on your mind if you're in a shelter is a computer," he says. 
"You're not thinking it can do anything for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ornellas' age, poverty and transient life seemed to place him at the greatest 
risk of getting left behind in the computer revolution. Instead, he became part 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ornellas is an anomaly, an exception in the growing ranks of people pushed 
aside by technology's march, ranks that include citizens both educated and 
affluent. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: Fax machines and satellite television help stir democratic upheaval 
among the have-nots in China and Russia, but Armani-suited law partners in the 
United States hire twentysomething assistants because they can't work a 
personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's expanding electronic personality shines in the ease in which the 
computer literate can withdraw money from a bank, learn livestock prices, order 
a plane ticket, pick up CNN in Hungary, send a fax from Hanoi, and skip through 
a recording by the New York Philharmonic or U2. 
</P>
<P>
 But millions of people choose not to live that way. To them, computers are 
either too impersonal, or too daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, many more people have been left behind for economic reasons -- they 
cannot afford or have no access to computers -- and their troubles are 
multiplying as the cost of living outside the electronic world spreads from 
merely having fewer job opportunities to social and cultural disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
 It impacts on even the simplest levels: More and more banks, for example, now 
charge less to checking account customers who transact only with automated 
tellers rather than people. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the down side of the electronic personality -- threatening to 
victimize rather than revolutionize. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has just started writing new telecommunications law, trying to 
balance the desire to give everyone access to advanced technology and services 
with the need to avoid costly subsidies for equipment and training. 
</P>
<P>
 But some consequences of technology's march have not gained as much attention, 
just as the exodus to the suburbs and decline of cities was not foreseen during 
the building of interstate highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among them is the displacement of labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology began extensively replacing jobs in agriculture more than a century 
ago, and in manufacturing more recently. Now, jobs are being pushed aside in 
service businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 An oil company, for example, no longer needs a big staff at a depot in New 
Jersey, since a tanker driver can indicate how much gasoline he's taking via a 
computer tied to the company's main office in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies now hire fewer secretaries, since managers themselves write and 
change documents on PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 And not long from now, some experts say, advanced technology will push aside 
pharmacists and clerks in video, music and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "With electronics, you have ubiquitous opportunities for large-scale 
elimination of the need for employee labor," said Thomas Hirschl, a Cornell 
University sociologist. "Now, the question becomes, where are people going to 
go? That's the question nobody really seems to have the answer for." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One way to look at it is that people can be retrained, but the stakes are 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do it wrong, everybody is unemployed and our economy goes to hell in a 
handbasket," said Arno Penzias, the Nobel Prize-winning vice president of 
research at Bell Labs. "I don't know how to work it but, from a techie point of 
view, that's what I see happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Chronic homelessness, the forced early retirement of managers in middle age 
and the difficulty many college graduates have finding jobs previously deemed 
worthy of their education are signs of how the technology-fueled replacement of 
labor is rippling throughout the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't stop progress," said author John Naisbitt, whose "Megatrends" was 
one of the most popular books of the 1980s. "What happens classically is these 
new areas create new jobs. Think back 20 years ago -- there wasn't a single 
person in biotechnology." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of obsolescence puts enormous pressure on schools, where most 
people first learn about computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many schools still view computer skills as static, like 
learning how to hammer. The state of Michigan, for example, requires students 
to take one computer class in either junior high or senior high. At the rate 
computers and software change, however, a student who opts for the course in 
seventh grade is leagues behind the real world at graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, because funding differs widely, some schools have shiny new 
machines and well-trained teachers, while others rely on corporate 
hand-me-downs and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems with technology is people who can afford it and be 
exposed to it can move ahead," said David Bunnell, editor in chief of New Media 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the affluent in their school districts have fundamentally better access to 
computers and tools, then it really is going to disadvantage people," said 
Mitchell Kapor, chairman of Electronic Frontier Foundation, which promotes 
civil liberties in use of computers and electronic networks. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the burden, private enterprise and public initiatives have stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Futurekids Inc. has more than 300 centers around the country where parents pay 
about $75 a month for their children to receive weekly lessons on the latest 
computers and software. The company now gets about half its revenue by putting 
on workshops in school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are scores of centers, chiefly in big cities, where people 
can learn about computers for free or at little cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers & You, a volunteer-run center in San Francisco, has taught computer 
skills to more than 4,000 low-income children and adults during the last five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is broader than giving job skills," said director Ann Jochnick. 
"It's giving people access to do whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every community, every barrio, every housing project needs to have a 
multitude of these technology drop-in centers that offer people the experience, 
engaging in, being exposed to these core technologies," said Ramon Morales, 
executive director of Playing to Win, a drop-in center in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have that, if people don't have an opportunity to learn and to 
do it, to have access, what invariably will happen is we will create this 
two-tier society." 
</P>
<P>
 To be served by such places, though, many people must first set aside a fear 
of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "People feel scared, uneasy," said Robert Lucky, vice president of applied 
research at Bellcore, the research arm of local phone companies. "They don't 
know how to work an ATM machine, for example, and they don't want to be seen to 
be so." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem occurs more with adults than children, said Bill Gates, chairman 
of Microsoft Corp., the giant PC software company. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just aren't willing to put up with a few hours of confusion and sort of 
get over the hump," Gates said. "Whereas kids, they're always confused and 
learning new things all the time so, what the heck, they dive in." 
</P>
<P>
 One answer, of course, is simpler machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer Inc. built a franchise around its easier-to-use Macintosh 
computer, and General Magic Inc. and others have developed even 
easier-to-understand pictures and guides for hand-held computers and advanced 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T's Penzias believes the breakthrough will occur when machines respond to 
speech -- an area in which a few telephone companies and computer-makers are 
taking baby steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, the only way people are going to be able to deal with what they 
have," he said, "is to be able to talk to the machine."

IT PAYS TO HOLD A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO; INVESTMENTS: A MIX OF STOCK, BOND AND 
MONEY FUNDS IS RECOMMENDED TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS AND REDUCE RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHET CURRIER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing goes further to explain the widespread appeal of mutual funds than the 
diversification they provide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a single package, a fund gives investors with as little as a few hundred 
dollars access to a broad portfolio of stocks, bonds or other investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who wish to diversify further can easily do so by spreading their 
money over half a dozen funds of different types and brand names. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diversification is the best way to maximize your returns and reduce your 
risk," notes Value Line Securities of New York in a bulletin to investors in 
its fund family. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mix of stock, bond and money funds will cushion the impact of a stock or 
bond market correction. Gains in one asset often offset losses in others, while 
the end result typically is a solid return over the long term." 
</P>
<P>
 This simple idea is close to a sacred principle in the world of investing. But 
like other great virtues, it can lead to trouble if misunderstood or 
misapplied. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that what looks like diversification sometimes does not provide 
the degree of desired protection. A portfolio of many large growth stocks, for 
instance, cannot provide much cushion in a period when large growth stocks in 
general are out of favor, as they have been for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A portfolio split between stocks and bonds may suffer almost as much as a less 
diversified investment if a sustained rise in interest rates weighs down both 
the stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, stock and bond funds rose together through the early 1990s in 
response to falling interest rates. So it is clearly possible that they could 
decline together in a period of rising rates, as they have done in the past few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, funds whose names sound different may not always pursue truly 
different investment strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Currently," said John Rekenthaler, editor of the Morningstar Mutual Funds 
advisory service, "investors attempting to diversify their domestic stock picks 
by selecting one top fund from the growth, growth and income and small-company 
lists will probably land three portfolios stuffed with smallish, fast-growing 
firms." 
</P>
<P>
 Rekenthaler said a better way to get diversity among stock funds is to pick 
ones that differ in both the size of stocks that dominate their portfolios and 
the style they employ -- "growth," "value," or a combination of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, investors cannot assume that they have bought themselves some sort 
of impenetrable shield against the ravages of a pervasive bear market. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the 12-month period through Jan. 31, five major categories of stock funds 
tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. showed remarkably similar results. 
</P>
<P>
 The returns posted by capital appreciation, growth, small company growth, 
growth and income, and equity income funds all fell into a band between 15.25% 
and 16.92%. 
</P>
<P>
 If the positive market setting in which these gains occurred were turned 
upside down, it isn't hard to imagine all those categories taking parallel 
downward paths. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest rage in fund diversification is to go global with world stock and 
income funds. 
</P>
<P>
 International stock funds certainly have been an enriching addition to almost 
any portfolio over the past year, climbing nearly 50%. But of course these too 
could join in a general downtrend should a worldwide bear market occur. 
</P>
<P>
 So diversification should be thought of as beneficial, but not magical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Construct an all-weather portfolio -- blue-chip stocks, small stocks, 
different maturities of bonds, even some gold stocks or real estate," advises 
Richard Graber, senior vice president at Jones & Babson, manager of a fund 
group in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't necessary to invest every dime in common stocks, but keep enough of 
your portfolio there at all times to take advantage of future bull markets. 
Never become so cautious as to take away all of your opportunity for growth."

MIKE PENNER: GRETZKYFEST BECOMES DUCKS' SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gordie Howe wasn't there, but he was the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Eisner was there. Emilio Estevez was there. Jackie Joyner-Kersee was 
there. Ron Harper was there. The pint-sized cast of "D2: The Mighty Ducks" 
sequel was there. Bruce McNall smuggled his way in. 
</P>
<P>
 Every seat in the place was filled, as is the tradition on Hockey Night in 
Anaheim, and then some. Two hundred and eight media credentials were issued for 
the event, and the ink-stained brigade wasn't there to watch the ninth-place 
team in the NHL's Western Conference play host to the 10th-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they were there to watch Gretzky, The Two-Goals-Short One, on the offhand 
chance that history might be made Wednesday night. By now, the story has been 
beaten to death: Wayne Gretzky chases Gordie Howe's all-time NHL goals record . 
. . and chases it . . . and chases it. For nearly two weeks, Gretzky had been 
stuck on 798 goals, three shy of Howe's 801, but Tuesday he punched in No. 799 
against Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Gordie, they won't recognize the 174 goals you scored in the World Hockey 
Assn., but they do allow goals scored against Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Gordie's steamed. 
</P>
<P>
 As you may have heard, Howe, Gretzky's boyhood idol and longtime friend, who 
accompanied Wayne every photo op of the way when Gretzky broke his all-time 
points record in 1989, is sitting out this WayneFest. Howe believes the real 
record is 975 goals, NHL and WHA totals combined, but the real reason he hasn't 
joined the entourage is that Gordie knows his hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 A hat trick Wednesday would have gotten Gretzky the record, and that was the 
enticement that packed the house. Ten years ago, a hat trick was just another 
night at the office for Gretzky, but the '94 Gretzky is a different model, as 
are the '94 Kings, and Howe realizes that this thing could take weeks, even 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 If Gordie and Colleen Howe wanted to see the world, they'd have their travel 
agent book Paris, Tokyo and Jamaica -- not Calgary, Hartford and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 This is how this season is going for Gretzky and the Kings: 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when thousands turned out at Anaheim Arena, hoping for at least two 
goals from Gretzky, two goals were scored by Tim Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney plays for the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 With those goals, Sweeney moved within 778 of Howe. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Sweeney scored them, in the last 10 minutes of the game, the Ducks 
were moving toward a different kind of historical occasion -- their first 
victory against the once-mighty Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a blowout, too -- Ducks 5, Kings 2 -- and here come those Barry 
Melrose-to-be-axed rumors again after a 24-hour cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 These were supposed to be gimme points for the Kings, who were supposedly 
recharged after their 7-0 pasting of Ottawa, who were supposed to capitalize on 
their dominance over the Ducks and extend their record over the neighborhood 
wanna-bes from 4-0 to 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wayne Watch focused mainly on the Kings' bench, where a flu-stricken 
Gretzky spent a good portion of the evening sucking on an oxygen mask, and the 
Ducks made the remaining Kings look sick by scoring twice in the second period 
and twice again in the third, opening a flabbergasting 5-1 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 These same Ducks, still playing without Paul Kariya, The $2 Million Man Or 
He's Staying Home, went more than 200 minutes last week without scoring a goal. 
Two hundred minutes. That's more than three hours, more than three hockey 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about what one can do in 200 minutes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Win the L.A. Marathon, with time left over to cool down watching "60 
Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Watch "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Write a book about Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Read "The Bridges of Madison County," drive to Crown Books, demand a 
refund. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Listen to the collected recorded works of Pearl Jam. Twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows when the Ducks could reel off another 200 minutes of silence -- such 
a streak could begin anytime, anywhere -- but today, it's the Ducks who have 
back-to-back victories, not the Kings, and it's the Ducks who have more than a 
prayer at winning a playoff berth, not the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighth-place San Jose plays tonight, but until faceoff, the Ducks trail the 
Sharks by just four points. And on St. Patrick's Day, after 5 1/2 months of the 
NHL schedule, the Ducks lead the Kings, the Wayne Gretzky Kings, the defending 
Stanley Cup-finalist Kings, by three points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponder this quote from Ducks Coach Ron Wilson on the night of March 16, 1994: 
"I think (the gap with San Jose) can be closed. Obviously, we've got to get 
some help from L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was referring to the Kings' two games this weekend against Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 So it has come to this: The Kings playing spoiler, and blocking back, for the 
Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they split with San Jose," Wilson said, "and we pick it up on the road 
like we do. I'm not saying I like our chances, but we're a relaxed team. San 
Jose is putting a lot of pressure on themselves and L.A. . . . a lot of people 
are under a lot of pressure there." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just Gretzky chasing Howe anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's the Kings chasing the expansion Ducks of Anaheim. And, their 
self-respect.

JEFFIRES MAY SLIP AWAY FROM RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' courtship of free-agent wide receiver Haywood Jeffires suffered a 
serious blow Wednesday when the Raiders retained wide receiver Tim Brown by 
matching his offer sheet from the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires, a three-time Pro Bowl selection with Houston, visited Rams Park on 
Tuesday and had narrowed his choices to four teams -- the Rams, Denver, Houston 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver was Jeffires' top choice, but the Broncos extended a four-year, $11 
million offer sheet to Brown last week. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders had not matched the offer, Denver would have retained Brown and 
eliminated Jeffires from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffires earned $900,000 last season with the Oilers, and is seeking a 
contract that would pay him nearly $2 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The money could be a stumbling block for Denver. The Broncos also have been 
interested in free-agent wide receivers Henry Ellard of the Rams, the Jets' Rob 
Moore and San Diego's Anthony Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haywood would really like to be here," Denver Coach Wade Phillips told the 
Rocky Mountain News Wednesday. "But whether he would like to be here for our 
money is a big factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's feeling like he's the top receiver in the league. He indicated that when 
we went after Brown, it was good for him because it put the money up there for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams aren't expected to make an offer to Jeffires until at least 
Wednesday, the deadline for Houston to match the Rams' four-year, $4.1-million 
offer sheet to offensive lineman Kevin Donnalley.

LUNCEFORD IS PUTTING ONLY ONE FOOT FORWARD NOW; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: FORMER 
TRABUCO HILLS STAR'S NEW STANCE IS PRODUCTIVE AT LONG BEACH STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine Brett Butler switching to the right side and hitting like Mike Piazza, 
Luis Polonia turning around and batting like Tim Salmon, and you have an idea 
of the transformation Linda Lunceford underwent last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunceford spent her freshman and sophomore seasons on the Long Beach State 
softball team as a left-handed slap hitter. She'd get a running start in the 
batter's box while the pitch was coming in, flick her bat at the ball and rely 
on her speed to beat out infield singles. 
</P>
<P>
 The ploy made softball purists cringe, but it was effective. Lunceford, a 
former two-sport standout at Trabuco Hills High School, led the 49ers with a 
.316 average and scored 22 runs from her lead-off position in 1991, and she 
batted a team-leading .312 with 26 runs in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who saw the frosh-soph version of Lunceford might not have 
recognized her as a junior and senior. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-handed slap has been replaced by the right-handed rap. Lunceford has 
gone from the lead-off position, where her role was to get on base and score, 
to the cleanup or No. 5 spot, where she's expected to knock runners in. Now 
when she swings, her back foot is planted firmly in the box, not moving toward 
first base. She's more power, less finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not many switch-hitters in softball -- you have to have a lot of 
talent to do that," Long Beach Coach Pete Manarino said. "But she's a very 
gifted athlete. Because of her power, we decided to turn her around and hit 
right-handed full time." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a difficult adjustment for Lunceford, even though she was a 
switch-hitter in high school. She spent two full seasons as a left-handed slap 
hitter, and the swing from the right side seemed a bit foreign, as evidenced by 
her batting average dip to .244 as a junior in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lunceford has found her offensive groove again. The senior shortstop leads 
the team with a .447 average and has nine RBIs in 16 games. She's well ahead of 
last year's run-production pace, when she had 22 RBIs in 66 games. She recently 
broke the school career record for hits with her 217th. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to turn around and remember how my swing was right-handed," said 
Lunceford, who helped Long Beach advance to the College World Series in each of 
her first three seasons. "But I'm a lot more comfortable from the right side 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 The switch was more necessity than choice, the result of three major factors 
converging to slow Lunceford down and render her slapstick obsolete: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Summer of Love: During her freshman year at Long Beach, Lunceford met 
Scott Sanders, a pitcher from Nicholls State University in Louisiana who had 
completed his first season in the San Diego Padres' minor league system in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The two fell in love and are engaged to be married next October, which is 
good. But Lunceford also fell in love with the Cajun food preferred in Sanders' 
hometown of Thibodaux, La., which wasn't so good. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, expected to be Padres' third or fourth starter this season, and 
Lunceford spent the summer of 1991 together, and for Lunceford, it was the 
first summer she hadn't played on traveling all-star soccer or softball teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just ate all summer and hardly worked out," said Lunceford, whose younger 
sister, Christy, is an outfielder at Creighton. "Scott's a great cook, but all 
that Cajun food is fattening, a lot of fried stuff and cheeses. I came back 
(for my sophomore year) heavier." 
</P>
<P>
 How much heavier? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want you to put that in the paper," Lunceford said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 A slower Lunceford was able to work off many of those extra pounds during her 
sophomore season and was nearly back to full speed until . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * The Summer of Pain: The big toe on Lunceford's left foot had bothered her 
since her sophomore year of high school, but after her sophomore year of 
college, the pain had become unbearable. A doctor examined the toe and found 
that, much to Lunceford's surprise, it had actually been broken four years 
earlier and never healed properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of bone fragments and calcium deposits, and the ligaments 
were twisted around," said Lunceford, who scored 31 goals in her senior season 
on the Trabuco Hills soccer team and was named Pacific Coast League most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunceford underwent two toe surgeries, one after her sophomore season at Long 
Beach and one after her junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That slowed me down two or three steps to first, plus I couldn't run or 
workout during those summers," Lunceford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunceford tried some slap-hitting at the beginning of her junior season but 
was not nearly as effective, primarily because of her loss of speed and . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * The Lunceford Shift: It didn't take long for opponents to catch on to the 
slap. When Lunceford came to bat, some teams would bring the third baseman and 
shortstop in, the first baseman in so far she could shake hands with the 
pitcher, and move the second baseman to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a surprise at all anymore," said Lunceford, 21. "It's not effective 
unless you're unbelievably fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Lunceford, no longer the speed demon she was earlier in college, scrapped the 
slap and went to a more traditional style of hitting. Her offense has helped 
Long Beach to an 11-6 start this season, including a 7-1 performance in the 
recent Texas A&M tournament. She is also one of the best defensive shortstops 
in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-time Big West all-conference selection and a third-team All-American 
pick in 1992, Lunceford has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the 1996 
U.S. Olympic team. But she doubts she'll be representing her country in the 
Atlanta Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunceford, who will graduate with a criminal justice degree this spring, plans 
to start a family soon after her wedding and hopes to attend law school in a 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really want to try out for the Olympic team because I'm burned out on 
softball and (the Olympics) are not for two more years," Lunceford said. "I'm 
going to be married, and I just don't think I have it in me to keep playing."

CONTROVERSY SWIRLING AT BURROUGHS; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: DENIAL BY SCHOOL 
PRINCIPAL FOLLOWS LEAK FROM SEARCH COMMITTEE MEMBER THAT DOS REMEDIOS IS CHOICE 
FOR COACHING POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Burroughs High Principal Tim Buchanan said he has not told a soul. Nobody will 
know his choice to replace Gary Bernardi as the school's football coach until 
tonight, when he makes a formal recommendation to the Burbank Unified School 
Board of Education at Burbank City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan has kept mum to avoid the controversy and embarrassment that beset 
Burbank High administrators last month, when a school district official and 
members of a search committee leaked information to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buchanan couldn't avoid such turmoil. A member of the search committee 
said Buchanan has picked Glendale College assistant Robert dos Remedios.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee member, who asked not to be identified, said the committee 
voted, 7-6, for Pat Blackburn, a Burroughs assistant, but Buchanan overruled 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not making any comment about that," Buchanan said. "For somebody to come 
out of the committee and say Robert Dos Remedios (is my choice) is 
irresponsible. It puts a damper on future committee involvement in making a 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan would not comment when asked if he had chosen Dos Remedios, 27, a 
former Burbank High player, nor would he comment on whether or not a vote had 
taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Remedios said he was told about the committee vote and got encouraging 
news from Buchanan last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buchanan called me and said I was right there," Dos Remedios said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Remedios has no head coaching experience, which appears to be a concern 
among committee members who also interviewed St. Genevieve Coach Richard Fong 
and former San Fernando High Coach Tom Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Remedios was not surprised to hear his name had surfaced, saying, "When I 
talked to Tim, he said somebody had leaked something." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a Burbank trustee revealed John Hazelton as the committee's choice 
before the applicants were even interviewed. Fong and Dos Remedios were among 
the interviewers. When the two decided to apply for the Burroughs job, both 
said they were hoping for a fair shot, controversy-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody is not part of the solution," Buchanan said. "Somebody is part of 
the problem. Why is he trying to do that, unless he's trying to create a 
problem?"

VENTURA HIGHWAYMAN; ONCE HE GOT REVVED UP, JESSIE STEERED PIRATES INTO THE FAST 
LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stretched face down on the hardwood floor, perspiration pouring from his body 
and his hands covering his eyes, Brandon Jessie heard the celebration nearby 
but couldn't bear to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to end like that. 
</P>
<P>
 All the laughter and hugs and yelling in that torrent of humanity at the other 
end of the court was supposed to be done by Jessie and his Ventura College 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the script didn't work out. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't believe what had happened," Jessie said. "We were the No. 1 
team but we didn't get to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates entered the title game Saturday at UC Irvine poised to claim the 
state junior college championship, but Long Beach City College ruined those 
designs with a 63-61 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura endured a similar fate the season before in the final at the 
University of San Francisco. Ranked No. 1, the Pirates returned home with the 
bitter taste of a 97-88 upset defeat to Columbia College and the resolve to 
take care of business this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, another team gave them the business. Ventura weaved 37-2 and 36-3 
records the past two seasons, had winning streaks of 21 and 29 games, but fell 
short both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jessie, the heart and soul of the top-ranked team in the state since the 
preseason, was crushed. He lay motionless on the floor of the Bren Events 
Center for a few seconds until Coach Philip Mathews asked him to join the other 
Pirates on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie trudged to the sideline, threw a towel over his head and sat quietly, 
his marvelous two-season career at Ventura ended in despair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few days have passed since that defeat, but the heartache is still visible. 
It probably will be for a long while. 
</P>
<P>
 To Jessie, a 6-foot-5 forward with remarkable quickness and jumping ability, 
winning the state championship was the ultimate payoff for those months of hard 
practices and tough games. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived at Ventura two summers ago with unquestionable credentials as a 
player but a notorious reputation for wanting to do things his way, on and off 
the court. Part of that came from his great success as a basketball, football 
and track star at Edison High in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As a three-year varsity starter for the Chargers, Jessie set school records 
for points (1,580) and rebounds (818) and twice was named the most valuable 
player in the Sunset League. He was also an outstanding wide receiver and 
league sprint champion in track. His schoolwork and attitude, however, needed 
some adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit I was crazy," Jessie said. "I did a lot of stupid things. . . . I 
started getting into fights at parties, my grades suffered." 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Ron, the former Ram All-Pro wide receiver, heard about the Ventura 
basketball program. He learned that Mathews stressed academics, so he prodded 
his son to visit the school. Jessie was sold immediately but soon realized he 
had walked into a land mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in at over 240 pounds (he weighs around 215 now) and I was way out of 
shape," Jessie said. "Every day in conditioning he (Mathews) would be running 
next to me, yelling in my ear, calling me fat and lazy. After my first day, I 
called my mom and told her I wanted to come home. I said, 'He is killing me.' 
My dad got on the phone and said to stick it out, that I had made a 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 The advice paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992-93 season, Jessie averaged 16.5 points and 9.3 rebounds in the 
regular season, and was named to the All-Western State Conference North 
Division first team after helping the Pirates to their seventh consecutive 
divisional title. He led the team in scoring with 78 points and in rebounds 
with 34 in three games at the state championships, and was selected to the 
all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mathews, who says he rode his prized player in order to tap into Jessie's 
vast potential, the results confirmed that he had Jessie headed in the right 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brandon came in with the reputation that he played any which way he wanted," 
Mathews said. "We decided he was going to play the VC way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under Mathews, who guided the Pirates to the state title in 1987 and to the 
final eight the past three seasons, the VC way of playing basketball means 
all-out, intense, baseline-to-baseline action for 40 minutes. Loafers need not 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
 No one perhaps exemplified that approach like Jessie, a tireless worker who 
seldom gave up on a loose ball or a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid can really play," Mathews said. "He has immense talent. On raw 
talent, he is probably the best we've had. I put him in a class with (Cedric) 
Ceballos (of the Phoenix Suns). . . . He could be in The League (NBA) if he 
wants to." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Jessie seemed as if he belonged in another league this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He blossomed into a force who led the team in practically every category and 
took the Pirates to another WSC North title. Jessie averaged 22.9 points, 10.9 
rebounds, made 51.6% of his shots and 74.8% of his free throws, and had a 
team-high 70 steals. The division coaches named Jessie and teammate Joey 
Ramirez co-most valuable players and their counterparts around California voted 
Jessie the state's co-player of the year with Columbia's Jamie Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
 During the state championships last week, Jessie scored a tournament-high 78 
points, had 23 rebounds in three games and was named to the all-tournament 
team. But the trophy that got away, the one presented to the winning team, is 
what Jessie wanted most. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we go through here from August to March, the conditioning, the practices 
-- it's brutal," Jessie said. "I mean, to work hard like that and get to the 
finals and lose it. The first year was unbelievable. The second year was 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy-five percent of it was the loss of the game but the other 25% was 
knowing that I wouldn't be playing anymore with Joey or D'Mitri (Rideout) or 
Michael (Tate) or Alfred (Kennedy). We did everything together for two years. I 
told the guys and the coaches after the game that it was the best two years of 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 That old gang of theirs will be elsewhere next season, playing for other 
coaches and with new teammates, perhaps in faraway places. Jessie has been 
courted by virtually every major four-year school in the country but still 
doesn't know which he will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 He considered an offer to play football and basketball at Florida State, but 
says he hasn't heard from Seminole officials lately. However, he did hear from 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has crossed my mind (playing football and basketball) so many times," 
Jessie said. "My dad said it would be hard. He said to save my bones now and 
stick to basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 That must be sweet music to recruiters from Duke and UCLA and Georgetown and 
other Division I schools jockeying for position to persuade Jessie to join 
their program. A sociology major, Jessie has the grades to attend the 
university of his choice but he apparently has narrowed the front-runners to a 
precious few. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at so much stuff (when selecting a school)," Jessie said. 
"Who is leaving (the team)? Who is coming in? Will you get playing time? Every 
decision would be good. You just have to make the best one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been talking to Duke a lot. I've been talking to (center) Cherokee 
(Parks, another former Orange County high school product) and he thinks I can 
come in and definitely play. I also would like to stay close to home and UCLA 
would be good for me because of that. That's what's going to get me, right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jessie said he will visit five campuses in the next few weeks before 
deciding. He said his two seasons at Ventura were a solid foundation for what's 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up a lot here," he said. "The discipline I learned here will stick 
with me for the rest of my life. I think Coach (Mathews) has prepared me very 
well. He got me mentally ready for anything I'm going to face at a higher 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made it through two years of hell with Phil Mathews. But it was worth it."

 The school announced Wednesday that Rider, 47, will replace Mike Dunlap, who 
guided the Kingsmen to an 80-55 record during his five years at the school, 
including a school-record 25-3 mark this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, 36, announced last fall that this would be his last season at Cal 
Lutheran because he had signed a five-year contract to coach the Adelaide 36ers 
of Australia's National Basketball League. The NBL season starts next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key word will be continuity," Rider said. "Coach Dunlap has done a great 
job there and I just want to continue what he's started." 
</P>
<P>
 Rider has been an athletic director in the Boise (Ida.) School District for 
the past two years but has 22 seasons of coaching experience at the collegiate 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an assistant at Boise State from 1983-92 after a one-year stint as an 
assistant at Cal State Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1973-82, he was the head coach at Chapman College (now Chapman 
University), where he compiled a 136-94 record. The Panthers posted a 19-10 
record during the 1976-77 season and qualified for the NCAA Division II 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, he was an assistant at Utah from 1970-73. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once coaching is in your blood, it's in your blood," Rider said. "I had an 
opportunity to move into an athletic administrative position two years ago and 
I took it, but I knew I would get back into coaching if the right opportunity 
presented itself. I jumped at this chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Rider was one of two finalists for the job. The other was Bob Hawking, an 
assistant at Cal State Fullerton and a former coach at Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 Rider and Hawking comprised half of a final four list which included Bill 
Whiting, an assistant at Occidental College, and Dave Bale, an assistant at the 
University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Rider will take over a program that advanced to the round of 16 of the NCAA 
Division III playoffs this season. However, only two of the top seven players 
from that team are expected to return next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Ridley (20.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.2 assists per game), Derrick Clark 
(15.9 ppg, 7.6 rpg) and Paul Tapp (12.5 ppg) are seniors. Junior Rupert Sapwell 
(13.1 ppg, 7.0 rpg) will graduate in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Smith, a 6-foot-5 freshman swingman from Melbourne, Australia, averaged 
9.0 points and 4.7 rebounds, but said Wednesday that he expects to be playing 
for a different school next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore point guard Dave Ulloa (9.3 ppg, 4.3 apg) and junior center Paul 
LaMott (6.7 ppg, 4.0 rpg) are the starters who are expected to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a challenge," Rider said. "I know that Mike had a senior-laden 
team this season, but I'm looking forward to getting started." 
</P>
<P>
 Rider was a four-year starter at Northeast Missouri State University and 
earned undergraduate degrees from the school in business administration (1968) 
and in physical education (1970).

ANGELS ARE CLOSE TO DEALING SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barring a change of heart, the Angels are expected to trade first baseman J.T. 
Snow to the New York Mets for starter Anthony Young this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel and Met officials confirmed The Times' report Wednesday that the deal 
has been proposed, and the Mets are awaiting the Angels' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 1-0 with a 2.73 earned-run average this spring while yielding nine hits 
in nine innings, is scheduled to pitch today against the Dodgers in Vero Beach, 
Fla. The Angels have sent Moose Stubing to scout the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like Anthony Young an awful lot," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said, 
"and we believe he'll be even better with a change of scenery. I think it's 
pretty obvious that we need to add a pitcher, and he has as good an arm as 
anyone that we're looking at." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Young was 1-16 last season, and set a major league record by losing 
27 consecutive games over two seasons, he had a 3.77 ERA, including a 1.65 ERA 
after the All-Star break. The Mets' average of 1.79 unearned runs during 
Young's 39 games was the worst in the majors. His team averaged only 2.9 runs 
in his starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good arm that maybe needs a change of scenery to turn it around," 
said Bob Harrison, assistant to Bavasi. "We think he can become a proven 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who has been held out of the starting lineup the last two games, said he 
was surprised when he heard about the possible trade Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely a bit of a shock," he said, "but it's one of those things 
that you have no control over, so I'm trying not to dwell on it, especially 
until something actually happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, batting .161 this spring, is expected to become the Mets' everyday first 
baseman.

BRYANT MURDER CASE IS RETURNED TO D.A.'S OFFICE; APPEAL: RULING RENEWS A DEBATE 
AND LEAVES MIXED FEELINGS AMONG STATE PROSECUTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six years ago, when gunmen shot up a Lake View Terrace house and killed four 
people, police blamed the crime on the "Bryant Family," which detectives 
described as a huge crime syndicate with a lock on the multimillion-dollar 
cocaine trade in the northeastern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests of the suspected killers set off a tortured legal process, which 
has continued to this day with no trial date even in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest action, a state appeals court has taken the prosecution's role 
away from the state attorney general's office and returned it to the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office. That renews the debate over whether 
the district attorney's office acted improperly, tampering with witnesses and 
withholding evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 It also left mixed feelings in the state prosecutors' office. The state did 
not want the job to begin with, but by now two of its lawyers have worked 
nonstop for almost a year on the complicated case, gathering evidence and 
plotting legal strategy in the hopes of convicting alleged drug kingpin Stanley 
Bryant and his associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant and three others could face the death penalty for the charges. Another 
four defendants face lesser charges. All have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The state prosecutors' work will be mostly superfluous if their office has 
nothing to do with the trial. But that was the decision by the three judges of 
the 2nd Appellate District panel, who ruled that the trial judge overstepped 
his authority in ordering the entire district attorney's office "recused" -- 
withdrawn from the trial. The Superior Court trial judge, J.D. Smith, acted 
after defense lawyers accused the district attorney's office of improprieties, 
including witness tampering and withholding evidence from the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers for Bryant and other defendants had no comment Wednesday 
on the appellate ruling. However, some of them still don't want county 
prosecutors on the case and have indicated they will appeal to the state 
Supreme Court, state prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous appellate ruling was made March 4, but neither side made public 
the development until this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, state prosecutors fought against taking on the case, saying the 
district attorney's office was much more familiar with the intricacies of the 
complex prosecution. Supervising Deputy Atty. Gen. Tricia Ann Bigelow argued in 
court that even if the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct were true -- 
which county prosecutors denied -- they were not sweeping enough to taint the 
entire district attorney's office and all of its 900 or so prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 State Justice Department authorities said Wednesday that the appeal court's 
ruling was exactly what they wanted and had requested. Nevertheless, they said, 
they had mixed feelings about having to give up the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have two terribly disappointed lawyers who worked hard on this case, 
believed in it and didn't want to see it go back," said Chief Assistant Atty. 
Gen. George Williamson, who runs the state Justice Department's criminal 
division in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they knew walking in that they might be bridesmaids, without guarantees. 
We are satisfied that the L.A. D.A.'s office can handle it. It is a monster of 
a case." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Bryant Family case has generated tens of thousands of pages of 
legal documents, and rancorous arguments among defense lawyers, prosecutors and 
police -- especially over allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged Bryant Family crime ring was suspected of selling half a million 
dollars in cocaine a month in the northeast Valley in the 1980s and of 
masterminding the attack in which four people -- including a mother and her 
young child -- were allegedly shot to death as a way of intimidating rival 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Bigelow said that she still believed county prosecutors were in 
a better position to handle the case.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any question but that we are pleased with the 
decision," Bigelow said. "It is a just result." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office had little to say. "Obviously, we will do what 
the court tells us to, and we are prepared to try it, if it reaches that 
stage," said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an attorney assigned to the case and we are prepared to go to court." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said state prosecutors started meeting Wednesday with their 
counterparts in the district attorney's office to begin handing over evidence 
and legal strategy gathered during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 31-page ruling, the appellate judges in effect agreed with the state 
attorney general's office, which in its appeal of Judge Smith's ruling said he 
had abused his discretion by recusing the entire district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers, the appellate panel wrote, "have not articulated how the 
conduct of the (district attorney's) office will deprive them of the likelihood 
of a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, defense lawyers alleged that prosecutors tried to sway a witness 
into recalling events in a certain way that would bolster the prosecution's 
case, and then tried to cover up the concerns of a deputy district attorney 
that his colleagues were violating rules against witness tampering. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they contended, the district attorney's office withheld some 
information relating to the alleged witness tampering from them, indicating bad 
faith on the part of prosecutors and making it impossible for their clients to 
get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in the district attorney's office also alleged more than a year 
ago that their own office and the Los Angeles Police Department had been 
infiltrated by members of the Bryant crime family. Such an infiltration, 
alleged by some county prosecutors in court documents, would have presented the 
district attorney's office with a conflict of interest, because some of their 
colleagues could conceivably be co-conspirators with the Bryant Family 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers countered that the allegations were floated as a way of making 
the defendants look worse in the eyes of potential jurors. Smith ruled in 
December, 1992, that he saw no evidence of such an infiltration.

ON THE ROAD TO RESEARCH; CSUN: GRATEFUL STUDENTS ARE SHUTTLED TO UCLA 
LIBRARIES. BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 All Zepur Jakmakian wanted was a quick trip to the library to get started 
researching a paper for her biology class at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, that would have meant a 10-minute walk across campus. This week, it 
turned into a 3 1/2-hour ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Jan. 17 earthquake closed CSUN's sole library and it may take a 
year to reopen, campus officials have had to arrange alternate service at UCLA. 
They have set up a free daily shuttle bus service to ferry students to the 
Westwood campus' 13 libraries, hourly from morning to night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jakmakian, a 22-year-old biology major, made the 40-minute trip to UCLA 
earlier this week, only to discover she'd left her books back at CSUN. That 
meant a bus trip back to CSUN, and then another back to UCLA, getting caught in 
rush-hour traffic on the way. Net time to arrive: 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 While most students making the UCLA journeys praised CSUN officials for 
establishing the alternate library service, many also are finding the new 
arrangement has its limitations, and certainly is unforgiving of mistakes like 
Jakmakian's. Some also are discovering a new sense of what they've lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to complain about it all the time, but now we really miss it," 
Jakmakian said of CSUN's Delmar T. Oviatt Library. The 220,000-square-foot 
centerpiece of the campus, also the largest library in the San Fernando Valley, 
was one of the CSUN buildings most damaged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, the 13 UCLA libraries house more than 6 million volumes, 
compared to the 1.1 million volumes in CSUN's single library. And some CSUN 
students said they enjoy leaving the disarray of their campus for UCLA's 
tranquil grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the downside, others reported difficulties finding materials in UCLA's 
vast library system, much less navigating their way around an unfamiliar 
campus. And given the travel time from Northridge, gone are impromptu library 
trips during one- or two-hour breaks from class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty hard. We've got to go to different libraries for different 
sources," said Kiet Tom, a 19-year-old history major who said his classmates 
have found UCLA "very confusing. We don't have big giant libraries like at 
UCLA," Tom said of CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 Last semester, Tom said he was constantly at CSUN's Oviatt Library during the 
week but was able to go home on weekends to relax with his family near 
Chinatown. Now, he's going to UCLA about twice a week but having to spend all 
Saturdays and Sundays studying at the downtown Los Angeles Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Liliana Vega, a junior psychology and child development major, made her first 
bus trip to UCLA this week, saying, "I have to look for psychology journals, 
but I don't know where to go." Fortunately, she received a guided tour from one 
of the CSUN librarians who have been sent to help at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega earlier had tried the library at Mission College near her home in Sylmar, 
but didn't find what she needed. Her plight pointed out an additional 
complication for CSUN students: The earthquake also has closed many other 
libraries in the area, and the remaining ones are not university caliber. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN officials are working on two temporary library operations on campus, but 
they will be mostly electronic when they open, in several weeks at the 
earliest. There are no plans to remove most of the books from the Oviatt 
Library. So the UCLA operation will continue at least through the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 However, UCLA and CSUN officials said an agreement already has been signed 
that will give CSUN students and faculty on-line access to UCLA's library 
catalogue at the two temporary CSUN sites. They also will be able to order for 
a fee materials from UCLA that will be delivered by the buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus ridership has risen steadily through the first month of classes at CSUN, 
peaking at 2,250 last week, said Astrid Logan, CSUN's transportation programs 
manager. Gloria Werner, UCLA's university librarian, said more than 700 CSUN 
students have obtained UCLA library cards. 
</P>
<P>
 One satisfied customer was Mandana Dehdashti, a 23-year-old CSUN medical 
technology major and self-described "library person" who came to UCLA just to 
find a quiet place to study. Dehdashti said she even studied on the bus and 
then used UCLA's own shuttles to get around the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was better than staying at CSUN trying to study in the cafeteria. You 
can't find a place to sit," she said, also citing the lack of study space for 
CSUN students on class breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I'd prefer if the Oviatt was open. But since it's not, this is the 
best they can do," she said.

FUND-RAISING LETTER AIDS IMPRISONED KOON; CRIME: PLEA PORTRAYS HIM AS A 
SCAPEGOAT. IT STRETCHES THE TRUTH, DESCRIBING RODNEY KING AS A PCP-CRAZED 
MURDER SUSPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The book publisher for Stacey C. Koon, the former Los Angeles Police 
Department sergeant serving prison time for the beating of Rodney King, has 
circulated a mass appeal for donations to help Koon's struggling family and 
help him appeal his federal civil-rights conviction as far as the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, which bears Koon's letterhead and signature, has been sent out 
nationwide in recent months under the auspices of the Stacey Koon Defense Fund, 
run out of a mail drop in Glendale. It has generated enormous financial support 
from police officers and citizens for Koon, his wife and their five children, 
according to Koon's Washington, D.C.-based publisher, Regnery Publishing Inc., 
which organized the fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But the letter, which the publisher said was "basically" written by Koon 
himself, is filled with politically volatile assertions, half-truths and 
unsubstantiated allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, Koon lambastes King as a PCP-crazed homicide suspect at the time of his 
arrest in 1991 and says King was not struck in the head with police batons and 
"only suffered minor injuries when finally forced to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those are assertions that court evidence and even Koon's former lawyer 
indicate are unproven or untrue. Koon, currently serving a 30-month sentence in 
federal prison in Dublin, Calif., could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-page typeset letter also claims that Koon and convicted Officer 
Laurence M. Powell "are the political scapegoats of black radicals and 
self-serving liberal politicians who know that we are innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, Koon is quoted as telling readers that when they hear "the 
whole story, (they) will be shocked, stunned and convinced that my officers and 
I were sold out by weak politicians and a deceitful news media." Until then, he 
asks readers for as much as $1,000 from each of them so he and Powell can 
appeal their cases and get out of prison before being killed by cop-hating 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will take dollars," Koon writes, "lots of them." 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't clear how much money has been raised so far or where all of it is 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 The publisher of Koon's 1993 book, "Presumed Guilty: The Tragedy of the Rodney 
King Affair," said this week the letter was his idea and that Koon had help 
writing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred S. Regnery, president of Regnery Publishing, said most of the money 
would go to Koon's family and to pay his legal bills. But he acknowledged that 
wrapped in with the fund-raising letter was a sales pitch: Give the former 
sergeant's defense fund a $30 donation or more and get a copy of his book. 
</P>
<P>
 Regnery said those copies would be given to the defense fund at "slightly over 
cost" but declined to say how much money the publishing company and defense 
fund would keep before passing the rest along to Koon and his family. He said 
he was not trying to make a profit from increased book sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising appeal has been aimed not only at police officers but regular 
citizens as well, Regnery said, and it has generated thousands of responses and 
donations. "It's been very good," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, it's been astoundingly good. Much higher than we anticipated, in 
terms of the number of responses and the size of the contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the defense fund is not a political entity or charitable group, it 
does not have to report to state or federal watchdog agencies how much money it 
has raised and how much of that it has passed along to its intended benefactor, 
according to the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have questioned the motivation of the fund-raising letter, saying it is a 
revisionist history that distorts the facts established in the two King-related 
trials and divides the city as police officials and city leaders continue to 
promote healing in the wake of the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officers beat King, an African American, on March 3, 1991, after he 
refused to pull over his car and led them on an eight-mile chase. Koon and 
three other officers were found not guilty in state court and those verdicts 
ignited three days of rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials declined to comment on the letter, and Koon's current and 
former lawyers took pains to distance themselves from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is remarkable," said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor who 
monitored the federal trial last year in which Koon and Powell were found 
guilty of violating King's civil rights and were each sentenced to 30 months in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see defendants do this type of fund-raising," Levenson said, "but it is 
problematic when it becomes deceptive and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are laws that prohibit the use of the mails to obtain money 
through misleading communication, Levenson said it is unlikely that anyone will 
try to apply them to Koon. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Koon's letter attracted the attention of Los Angeles bunco 
squad detectives who investigate fraudulent fund-raising efforts. After a short 
investigation, the effort was found to be legitimate and the matter was 
dropped, police sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Identifying inaccuracies in the letter requires only a cursory review of 
evidence presented in the King beating and civil-rights trials. Even Laurence 
Powell's first name is spelled wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood tests taken after King was arrested did not offer evidence that he was 
under the influence of PCP when he was subdued by police, although the letter 
states as fact that he was. The accused officers have long maintained that King 
displayed signs of PCP intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also states that King needed to be subdued so aggressively because 
he was "the prime suspect in a homicide at the time of his arrest" -- another 
contention that prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed was untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how such a charge made its way into the letter, Regnery said: "I can't 
remember where that came from." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the letter's assertions that King was injured only by falling to 
the ground, doctors who testified for the prosecution at Koon's federal trial 
testified that King's face was fractured in 15 places, most probably from blows 
landed by a police baton or similar weapon. Doctors who testified for the 
defense disputed that account, saying that King's injuries were in fact the 
result of one or more face-first falls to the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Levenson also criticized the tone of the letter, which asserts that if Koon 
and Powell are not exonerated during their appeals, police won't subdue 
criminals in the future. "Neither you or your family will be safe from the 
likes of hardened criminals like Rodney King," the letter states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a blatant call for sympathy and financial support," Levenson said. "The 
disturbing thing about it is it . . . continues to throw up a divide at a time 
when we are trying to heal relations between police and the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson, who prosecuted the state case in which Koon 
and three of his subordinate officers were acquitted of improperly beating 
King, also said some of the assertions in the letter are at odds with testimony 
given during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Koon's lawyer in that case, Darryl Mounger, questioned whether the former 
sergeant would include such inaccuracies and contested facts in a public appeal 
for money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly doesn't sound like something Stacey would do," Mounger said. "I 
would not think Stacey Koon would acquiesce to someone else writing that 
letter, certainly because some things in there are not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Regnery, however, maintains that the fund drive is a sincere effort to help a 
cop who he says was hung out to dry by his city and Police Department. The two 
became friends, he said, when Koon spent a week at his house during a 
promotional tour for his book last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he went to prison, he seemed to me he was getting screwed and needed 
whatever help he could get," Regnery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regnery said Koon's wife, Mary, prefers not to comment about her family's 
plight. But in the letter, Koon says his wife has "suffered horribly" through 
the ordeal as have his children: Matthew, 15, Gregory, 13, Alicia and Kimberly, 
8, and Jennifer, 4. "While I am sent to prison," he writes, "who will take care 
of them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Koon's legal bills already have been paid. The police union already 
has paid at least $150,000 for his lawyers and court costs in the two trials. 
But Regnery and others said his bills are likely to climb as his appeal 
proceeds and that his family's expenses are mounting while he is in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government also has appealed Koon's sentencing, saying that U.S. 
District Judge John G. Davies erred in calculating the appropriate sentences 
for the two convicted officers. 
</P>
<P>
 After being suspended without pay in 1991, Koon was finally dismissed from the 
department several weeks ago after a short administrative hearing. His lawyers 
have contended that the city treated Koon unfairly for suspending him for so 
long without pay and because it did not pay his legal bills as it has in some 
other cases.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MISSING EL CENTRO WOMAN IS FOUND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 70-year-old El Centro woman missing since Saturday was found Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Eloisa Bermudiez Garrido, who walked away from her daughter's parked car near 
the Glendale Galleria, apparently wandered to a home near the mall, where she 
stayed until Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The family called police at about 5 p.m. Wednesday, saying they could not 
determine who the woman was or where she was from. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish they would have called us earlier," Glendale police spokesman 
Lief Nicolaisen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Garrido, who suffers from diabetes and a heart condition, had wandered away 
from the parked car while her daughter, Mimi Garrido of Van Nuys, was shopping 
in the mall. She has been living with her daughter recently because of a series 
of doctors appointments, including cataract surgery last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido was described by her daughter as a very outgoing person who would sit 
and talk with strangers for hours about her family. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BOARD APPROVES PAY RAISE FOR TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale teachers have won their first pay raise in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education on Tuesday unanimously approved a revised contract 
between the Glendale Unified School District and Glendale Teachers Assn. for a 
3% raise over two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members cautioned, however, that while the district has some extra 
dollars now, it may not be able to continue pay increases when the contract 
expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "If things are as bad next year as educators predict, we would not be bound to 
give another increase we just don't have," said Jane Whitaker, board president. 
She said the district does not expect to receive enough money from the state to 
meet its needs in 1995. "This is a guard against a time when we don't have the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Teachers Assn. President Sandy Steinberg said the association will 
review the district's budget and what its projected deficit is before asking 
for another raise in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to go after things that will break our district," Steinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Association members voted last month to accept the revised two-year contract, 
which calls for a 1.5% pay raise each year for 1993-94 and 1994-95. The wage 
hike is retroactive to July 1.  
</P>
<P>
 Teachers last received an increase at the beginning of the 1990-91 school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises, which will be reassessed when the current three-year contract 
expires in 1995, will cost the district about $785,000, officials said. The 
average salary for a Glendale teacher is $40,500 per year, while starting 
salaries are about $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's 1,200 instructors, a majority of whom are union members, had 
been working under a contract that did not include cost-of-living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 Association representatives and district officials began negotiations for the 
amended contract in October after the district received a $1.5-million windfall 
from lottery revenues and savings on health care expenses. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; EXHIBIT PUTS PUPILS IN TOUCH WITH SEA LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Second-grader Jasper Kim danced around a foot-deep saltwater tank filled with 
purple, black and red creatures chanting, "Will it bite me? Will it bite me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jasper, 8, was one of 600 Verdugo Woodlands Elementary School students who 
discovered how it feels to pet and hold starfish, baby sharks, velvety-black 
sea slugs, hermit crabs, purple urchins and anemones. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were exposed to sea animals -- most native to the California coast -- 
through a traveling exhibit, "Tide Pool Touch," sponsored by the Living Science 
Foundation. The nonprofit foundation, based in Woodside, Calif., brought its 
show to Verdugo Woodlands Elementary in Glendale on Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After being reassured that tide pool creatures were friendly, Jasper plunged 
his hand into the icy tank water and grabbed onto the waving tentacles of a 
lime-green anemone. "O-o-o, it's sticky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine biologist Kim Matthews, who travels with the exhibit to elementary 
schools statewide, told students that a more appropriate name for a starfish is 
a sea star. The sea star is not a fish, he said, explaining that it walks on 
the ocean floor rather than swimming in the water above it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels kind of funny," said Lauren Brennan, 7, when asked to comment about 
her first time holding a bright red sea star. "He's all rough and spiny, and 
kind of heavy too." 
</P>
<P>
 Students jumped back in horror when a classmate lifted a foot-wide sheep crab 
out of a simulated tide pool. The crab's beady eyes glared at the children as 
its legs waved wildly in the air.  
</P>
<P>
 "He wears his skeleton on the outside and he has no bones on the inside," 
Matthews said.  
</P>
<P>
 The foundation hopes the traveling tide pool will get students excited about 
science before they start making decisions in junior high about taking biology, 
zoology or chemistry, Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo elementary's cultural arts chairwoman, Linda Burk, said the traveling 
sea show provides a cost-effective way for children to participate in a field 
trip without leaving campus.  
</P>
<P>
 "For us to bus this many groups to an ocean tide pool would be 
cost-prohibitive. This way they get a hands-on experience right in the school's 
back yard," Burk said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; MISSION COLLEGE TO MARK 19TH BIRTHDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irish music and food might lead revelers to think that the celebration at 
Mission College today is in honor of St. Patrick's Day. But actually, it's a 
party for the school's 19th birthday -- a month late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our real birthday is in February, but we got off track with the earthquake," 
said Shari Borchetta, assistant to college President Jack Fujimoto. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration program will take place at noon in the campus center on 
Eldridge Avenue in Sylmar and will introduce the college's interim vice 
president of academic affairs, Paul McKenna. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tying it into St. Patrick's Day," said Neil Farren, dean of college 
advancement. "We're serving corned beef and (green) cabbage, potatoes, and 
we'll have Irish music." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenna is replacing Victoria Richart, who accepted a position as senior 
director of instructional and student services for the Los Angeles Community 
College District. 
</P>
<P>
 A Glendale resident, McKenna was director of instructional programs before 
joining the administration. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CONTROVERSIAL SHOP REDUCES ITS HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing a city investigation, owners of a Van Nuys doughnut shop that has been 
called a magnet for crime have voluntarily changed the store's hours to improve 
relations with police and to prevent a self-proclaimed citizen crime-fighter 
from using it as her base of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was praised Wednesday by Los Angeles police, who had complained that 
the 24-hour Orville's Originals on Sepulveda Boulevard was a public nuisance 
that has become a hangout for prostitutes and other street criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've won," said Capt. James McMurray, who commands the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Van Nuys station. "The idea of voluntary cooperation is what we've 
been working for all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Zuita and Ulysses Contador said they decided last week to close the 
shop between midnight and 5 a.m. in hopes of keeping out street crime fighter 
Mary Lou Holte. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they acknowledge that prostitutes are often customers, they said they 
believe Holte's activities to be the cause of a city zoning department 
investigation which began last week at McMurray's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had said the investigation could result in the city forcing the 
Contadors to reduce hours of operation, hire a security guard and other 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are losing a lot of business, but we don't want any more trouble with the 
police or with (Holte)," Zuita Contador said. "We are just doing this because 
if we close during these hours, (Holte) doesn't have any place to go." 
</P>
<P>
 City zoning officials were unavailable to comment on the impact the reduced 
hours will have on the investigation, which also targets a Laundromat in the 
same mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Holte refused to comment Wednesday on the fate of her vigils or her presence 
at the doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zuita Contador said that since the hours changed last week, Holte has not 
been in the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last five years, Holte, 45, has made the doughnut shop the base of 
operations for her street patrols, in which she confronts and reports people 
she suspects to be criminals. She also has made at least one citizen's arrest 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Holte's exploits as a crime fighter landed her on such television 
programs as "20/20" and "The Larry King Show," as well as in other national 
media. Police have said they see Holte both as an effective tipster and as an 
ineffective security force at the doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Holte has claimed that the city's investigation is being spurred by her 
rivals, including other neighborhood watch groups and police, whom she believes 
are jealous of her recent publicity and are trying to drive her away from the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 But McMurray did not claim a personal victory over Holte. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no desire to keep her out of anywhere," McMurray said of Holte. "It's 
just that the doughnut shop is a mecca (for criminals) at certain hours." JEFF

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: YOUTH SUICIDE RISK EXPECTED TO INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite an increase in the availability of school counseling since the 
Northridge earthquake, counselors in the district's suicide prevention unit 
expect the number of students who consider or attempt suicide to rise in the 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemary Rubin, a counselor with the suicide prevention unit for the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, said the risk of suicide increases after a 
disaster, especially for children and adolescents who already suffered from 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, the district offered sessions where teachers, counselors and 
administrators could talk about their experiences during the disaster and 
discuss ways to handle trauma or depression in students. Extra counseling is 
available to students with funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rubin said she expects the number of students experiencing suicidal 
thoughts and even those attempting suicide to grow, based on the experience of 
other school districts after disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 School psychologists in Dade County, Fla., for example, reported that more 
than a dozen elementary school children tried to kill themselves in a two-month 
period several months after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, compared to an average of 
one or two a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Cohen, school psychologist for Granada Hills High School, said he has 
counseled at least two students who were at risk for suicide since the quake, 
but cautioned that a connection between the disaster and the students' symptoms 
is difficult to make. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gerald Deskin, director of The Learning Center clinic in Encino, said that 
he has counseled more than 1,000 children and adults since the earthquake, and 
the temblor exacerbated feelings of depression for many people. SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; GEOLOGY USED IN COMBATTING QUAKE TRAUMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the theory that delving into facts instead of feelings will help them cope 
with the trauma of the Northridge earthquake, students at Chatsworth Park 
School are attending geology workshops instead of counseling sessions this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth Park Principal Barbara Champion said that when the elementary 
school received a federal emergency aid grant of about $5,500 for counseling 
after the quake, she decided a portion of the money would be better spent if 
used to hire an extra science teacher for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowledge is a good way to comfort," Champion said. "Instead of sitting kids 
down and saying, 'Tell me how you feel, honey,' they are sitting down and doing 
geology." 
</P>
<P>
 Science teacher Alex Koperberg, who is on break from his job teaching at 
O'Melveny School, spent his first day at the Chatsworth school Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught a class of fifth-graders how geologists explore the earth's interior 
using core samples, and had the students test the technique by plunging plastic 
straws into hard-boiled eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk moved on to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the earthquake you can't feel it, right?" asked 10 year-old Yotam 
Antonovich. "So what can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Koperberg's response? To prepare. He followed with a wealth of practical 
advice on how to deal with earthquakes, continually referring back to the 
children's own experiences Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives them a clear understanding of their environment so they are not 
superstitious," Koperberg said later. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it happens again they'll know we are not going to fall into the ocean," 
added teacher Bonnie Gould, who stayed to watch Koperberg teach her 
fifth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Rasmussen, federal emergency management aid coordinator for the 
district, said the grants, which have been provided by the U. S. Department of 
Education, are earmarked for counseling or other instructional support to help 
schools rebound from the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Other schools have used their share of the money to make up lost class time or 
to bring in psychologists to help students cope, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koperberg will continue lessons today and Friday for Chatsworth Park students 
and teachers. He will also offer a evening workshop for parents. JILL LEOVY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 13 FILE FOR NOLAN'S ASSEMBLY SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge, a former prosecutor, a policeman and an educator were among the 13 
candidates who filed to run for the state Assembly seat left vacant by the 
resignation of incumbent Pat Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, four candidates, including Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, filed for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seat now 
held by Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan resigned Feb. 18 after the Glendale Republican pleaded guilty to 
political racketeering, while Edelman announced late last year that he would be 
retiring when his current term expires in December. 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise candidates emerged in either race. Wednesday was the deadline for 
filing nomination papers in both races because neither has an incumbent 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 Filing for the Nolan seat in the GOP primary were Municipal Court Judge James 
Rogan of Glendale, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Peter Repovich of 
Glendale and Los Angeles Community College board member Julia Wu of Silver 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Rogan was overwhelmingly endorsed by delegates to a mini-convention 
staged by the area's Republican Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Repovich, who tried unsuccessfully to block that endorsement, observed later 
that "the 43rd District is bigger than this convention" and vowed to continue 
his fight for the GOP nomination while Wu supporters also privately complained 
that the convention was stacked in Rogan's favor with Old Guard Glendale 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Also filing to run in the June 7 Republican primary are David Wallis Jr., a 
retired engineer who is president of Sicimore Canyon Inc., the owner of the 
Chevy Chase Country Club; Matthew Collins of Burbank; Joseph Pietroforte of Los 
Angeles, and Louis Morelli of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Five candidates have filed in the Democratic primary for the 43rd District 
seat. They are Adam Schiff, a former federal prosecutor; Ken Kulpa of Burbank, 
Craig Freis, a member of the local Democratic Central Committee, Craig Byrnes 
of Glendale and Wesley James Koopman. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff has been identified by some of the region's Democratic lawmakers, 
including state Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), as their choice to try to 
undo decades of Republican rule in the 43rd District. 
</P>
<P>
 Also filing for the seat was Libertarian Willard Michlin, a real estate 
broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, long the heart of the district and a bastion of Republicanism, voted 
for Bill Clinton in 1992. Also, the registration of voters in the 43rd 
District, after the 1991 reapportionment, is 44% Democratic to 42% Republican. 
"This is not Orange County," Parke Skelton, Schiff's campaign manager, said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Running for the 3rd Supervisorial District besides Yaroslavsky, who has 
already raised nearly $750,000 for his campaign, are Don Wallace of Calabasas, 
a former fire captain and ex-deputy to Edelman; Elgin Trammel Jr., an attorney 
from Lake View Terrace, and Michael S. Hirsch, an environmental consultant from 
Van Nuys. JOHN SCHWADA

WOMAN DIES IN CRASH INVOLVING RUNAWAYS; ACCIDENT: AUTHORITIES SAY THE TWO 
YOUTHS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA WERE FLEEING POLICE IN A STOLEN TRUCK.

 A Palmdale mother was killed when her car was hit by a stolen truck carrying 
two boys, 12- and 15-year-old runaways from South Carolina, that went through a 
stop sign as they fled from police, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they intend to charge the older boy with second-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Deborah Jean Tabata, 39, was heading home after visiting her 
brother in Lancaster when she was killed in the crash Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had stopped by her brother's to help his kids rehearse for a school 
play," said Lynn Goodwin, Tabata's sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old driver of the pickup truck underwent surgery for a ruptured 
spleen Wednesday and the other boy was in fair condition at Antelope Valley 
Medical Center in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys had run away from homes in Ladson, S. C., just north of Charleston, 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour chase began at 7:22 p.m. Tuesday on California 138 in San 
Bernardino County, where sheriff's deputies stopped the boys for a traffic 
violation and they sped away. It continued into Lancaster, where the driver of 
the pickup, traveling at 90 m.p.h., went through a stop sign at 50th Street 
East and Avenue I, ramming Tabata's car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup truck then slammed into a power pole and burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains of a rifle were found in the wreckage and two pistols, which 
deputies believed the boys threw out of the truck before the crash, were 
recovered along the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the boys told Clark from the hospital that they didn't want to get 
caught and be sent back to South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the 12-year-old boy told them that he drove his stepfather's 
truck to his friend's house and the two drove across the country in three days, 
arriving in California during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believed the boys chose California because the 15-year-old 
juvenile had once lived in Palmdale.

AROUND THE VALLEY: ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE IS ONLY 18, BUT HE'S NO POLITICAL NOVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There he was again, Josh Arce, working the telephone in his UCLA dorm room 
trying to drum up support for his campaign to represent the northwestern San 
Fernando Valley in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be only an 18-year-old college freshman, but this is no political 
novice at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Arce -- then a Chatsworth High School senior -- became the youngest 
candidate for elected office in Los Angeles history, running unsuccessfully for 
the community college board at age 17. He was so young he couldn't even vote 
for himself in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 His tenacity intact, Arce, a Democrat, now hopes to oust Republican Paula 
Boland in the 38th Assembly District, which includes Chatsworth, Granada Hills, 
Northridge, Mission Hills, Canoga Park and part of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear in my mind a phrase that my high school football coach used to say to 
me," Arce says. "You can't win the game if you don't step out on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 So what if his campaign war chest holds a mere $150? 
</P>
<P>
 Arce learned how to grab many votes with little money during last year's race, 
when he garnered 28,753 votes on a $50 budget, spending 0.17 a cent for each 
vote -- well short of, for example, the $2.11 per vote that it cost Barbara 
Boxer to win a U. S. Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 And so what if he can't count on his own family for support? 
</P>
<P>
 When his grandmother not only refused to loan him the money to pay for his 
filing fee, but also informed him that she plans to vote for his rival Boland, 
Arce turned around and found someone else to spot him the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that his best friend and campaign manager, Jason Sattler, lives two 
counties away in Santa Barbara, where he's attending UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what telephones are for. 
</P>
<P>
 And never mind that Arce has yet to complete his first year at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Why just study politics when you can practice it instead? Arce says. Besides, 
he reasons, if he is elected, he could finish up his degree going part-time to 
UC Davis, which is near the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Boland, Arce is vying with Ventura Democrat Donald Cocquyt and 
Green Party member Charles Wilken in the primary election. And although he has 
yet to win the Democratic Party endorsement over Cocquyt, it's clear that Arce 
views incumbent Boland as his chief competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to show people that I can be more effective than Boland," Arce 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He points to a survey published in this month's issue of the California 
Journal, in which Boland ranks 71 out of 78 Assembly members for effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to suggest that on Jan. 17, we hit a crossroad," Arce says. "It's 
time to decide: Are we going to continue what we've been doing in the past? Or 
are we going to look at what happened during the earthquake and take it as a 
sign that change is needed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arce is running on a platform calling for cutbacks in fees at community 
colleges and universities and for breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School 
District into smaller districts. He also proposes slapping harsher penalties on 
businesses that hire illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 He and a couple of friends from high school have already collected 400 
signatures to qualify for the June primary and the endorsements of the 
California Democratic Council and Local 660 of the Service Employees 
International Union, which represents 42,000 county employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to spend his summer vacation walking the San Fernando Valley in 
search of votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce talks about his plans at his dorm room desk, cluttered with papers, 
bottles of vitamins, an orthodontic retainer and a couple of trophies from his 
high school football days. Posters from the Chatsworth movie theater where he 
was once an usher hang alongside a picture of actress Sharon Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I wrote her and asked for an endorsement and a contribution, but 
she sent back an autographed picture instead," he explains with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce's books about conspiracy theories surrounding the John F. Kennedy 
assassination also sit on a nearby shelf. At least one trait that the former 
high school homecoming king and his presidential idol seem to have in common is 
their appeal to women. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, four college women offered to vote for Arce in the five 
minutes it took him to buy a temporary parking permit at his dorm office. (When 
he asked, however, it turned out only one of the women lives in his district.) 
</P>
<P>
 The encouragement he receives from his peers, however, is offset by his 
staunchly Republican family's response to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them, if the worst thing I'm doing is running for political office, then 
that's not too bad," Arce says. "I could be out selling drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he acknowledges that he found it more than just a little discouraging when 
his grandmother, who belongs to the Northridge Republican Women's Club, refused 
to loan him the $400 filing fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I don't love him, but politically we don't agree" says Jane 
Bergquist, Arce's grandmother, who lives in the Chatsworth house next door to 
the one where Arce grew up. "This is kind of a funny thing -- but I'm so proud 
of him anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergquist let out a chuckle when asked if she would really pass over her own 
grandson's name on the June ballot in favor of Boland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we never know, do we, what we'll do when we get to the polls?" she 
said.

OFFICIALS CALL L.A.'S IMAGE KEY TO RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sell L.A.!" 
</P>
<P>
 That's economist Jack Kyser's advice to San Fernando Valley business people 
worried that the recent earthquake will delay Southern California's economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest obstacle to a recovery is overcoming Los Angeles' negative image 
-- compounded by the quake, coming on top of riots, fires and floods, said 
Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling L.A. is also the goal of the New Los Angeles Marketing Project, a 
coalition of business groups, local government agencies and industry 
representatives that Mayor Richard Riordan's office is trying to put together, 
Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer said Wednesday. Many other cities already have such 
marketing programs, including Miami, Dallas, Phoenix and Denver.  
</P>
<P>
 "This city has a lot of assets, but we've forgotten how to market them," Kyser 
told a meeting of the Valley Development Forum, a local nonprofit business 
group, at the Sportsmen's Lodge Hotel in Studio City Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The audience of about 40 real estate and other professionals heard the same 
pep talk from Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgardillo and Laurel Shockley, deputy 
director of the Los Angeles office of the California Trade and Commerce Agency. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Like most economists, Kyser expects Los Angeles-area companies to announce 
more layoffs this year. "Then, in 1995, we'll start to see modest job 
creation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the Jan. 17 temblor, the recovery "is on track and could even get 
here a little sooner" because of the infusion of $9.5 billion in federal 
earthquake relief.  
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies also are expected to pay $2.5 billion to individuals and 
businesses that suffered damage in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local business people who attended the Valley Development Forum's monthly 
breakfast meeting said they already see encouraging signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Builders are starting to come out of their caves for the first time since 
1990," said Jay S. Ross, who supervises major-construction lending for Woodland 
Hills-based Entertainment & Mortgage Corp.  
</P>
<P>
 Tourism has also picked up. Right after the quake, several tour groups 
canceled trips to the Universal Studios theme park, said Lawrence D. Spungin, 
president of MCA Development Co., based in Universal City. But attendance at 
the park, theaters and the CityWalk attraction has now returned to near summer 
levels, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But other Valley business people say California's business climate still is 
not as friendly as it should be, despite the state Legislature's recent 
progress on some issues, such as lowering employers' cost of workers' 
compensation insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 Both the state and the city of Los Angeles have tried to make it easier to 
obtain building permits. But more streamlining is needed, said Pasadena 
architect Lance Bird. "We continue to have nothing but problems with 
permitting. It's a disaster."  
</P>
<P>
 Delgardillo defended the city's efforts but warned that it will take time to 
dispel the notion that Los Angeles is a bad place to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it requires a whole cultural change. We've never had to do economic 
development in the city of Los Angeles before," he said. "All we had to do was 
wait a few days after the Rose Parade was shown on television in the Midwest to 
get 300 calls from people saying, 'We want to move there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer said the New Los Angeles Marketing Project is still "in the conceptual 
phase" but hopes to target businesses that are already located in the Southland 
or want to be, visitors and area residents.

LIMO OPERATOR SENTENCED AFTER SECOND CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Granada Hills man was sentenced to 100 days of community service and placed 
on three years probation after he was convicted a second time of operating a 
limousine service without proper permits, and making false and misleading 
statements, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Barry Kohn on Tuesday also ordered 
Leonard Kamenetsky, 23, -- who has used the aliases Leonard Kinske, Leonard 
Gerschcovich and Joseph Wasserman -- to work on a graffiti-removal crew and 
serve five days of electronically monitored house arrest, according to the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamenetsky was accused by Linda Vaisa, a state Public Utilities Commission 
investigator who conducted the initial investigation of his limousine business 
in 1992 after her office received complaints about the company's business 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 That investigation led to a conviction and an order to Kamenetsky to cease 
business operations at Deja Vue Limousine and Deja Vue Livery Inc. in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Kamenetsky made restitution to customers, paid $5,000 in PUC investigative 
costs and served 45 days on a Caltrans work crew, the city attorney's office 
said. But then he apparently moved his business to Fountain Avenue in Hollywood 
under the name Entertainment Express Limousine Service, ignoring the order to 
cease operating, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaisa opened a second investigation after learning that Kamenetsky was doing 
business again, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers lodged complaints that ranged from overbilling to billing credit 
card numbers for services that were never performed, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, customers said they were charged for limousine rides that 
were booked but never honored, and in other cases the quoted prices were nearly 
doubled. In one example, a woman was charged twice the quoted price, and 
another charge was placed on her credit card, the announcement said.

DEADLINE IS EXTENDED FOR DISASTER AID APPLICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With thousands of victims of the Northridge earthquake continuing to register 
for disaster assistance, the deadline for filing applications has been extended 
60 days to May 17, federal officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seeking financial aid can register at one of nine Earthquake Service 
Centers or three remaining Disaster Application Centers or by telephone at 
1-800-462-9029, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be sure that everyone affected by the disaster has ample time to 
apply," said Frank Kishton, coordinating officer for the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. FEMA and the governor's Office of Emergency Service jointly 
operate the service centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for the Small Business Adminstration's disaster loan program to 
individuals and businesses has also been extended to May 17. However, the 
deadline to apply for SBA's Economic Injury Loans -- which provide working 
capital for firms hurt financially by the quake -- remains Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 As of March 15, about 454,650 individuals had applied for assistance, more 
than 4,000 registering Tuesday alone. FEMA has disbursed nearly $473 million 
for disaster housing assistance, SBA has approved more than $456 million in 
individual and business loans and the state's Individual and Family Grant 
Program has approved nearly $6.4 million in aid. JULIO MORANDISASTER VICT

REPO MAN HELD IN SHOOTINGS; VIOLENCE: TWO UNARMED BROTHERS WERE WOUNDED IN THE 
SAN FERNANDO INCIDENT, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man trying to repossess a car was arrested and booked on suspicion of 
attempted murder Wednesday after he allegedly shot two unarmed brothers who 
confronted him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel and Maximilliano Salas of San Fernando were both shot once in the 
abdomen after the confrontation with Cass M. Cassillas, 24, of La Mirada, who 
worked for U. S. Recovery Service Inc. in Huntington Park, said Lt. Dan Peavy 
of the San Fernando Police Department. Both are expected to live. 
</P>
<P>
 A recovery service official refused to comment on the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Maximilliano Salas, 26, was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills, where he is listed in stable condition, a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, Gabriel, 20, was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, but 
hospital officials declined to discuss his medical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, responding to numerous 911 calls, arrived at the shooting scene in the 
700 block of Hollister Street at 6:40 a.m., Peavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were unarmed," Peavy said of the brothers, who owned the car. "I believe 
there had been a confrontation, but to my knowledge no physical confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassillas and recovery service employee Roger W. Boon, 24, of Pasadena were 
booked on suspicion of attempted murder, Peavy said. Peavy identified Cassillas 
as the man who fired the shots. Boon was later released. Cassillas' bail was 
set at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Repossession men are regulated under certain state laws, and they are not 
given carte blanche to use any and all methods to recover property, Peavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are allowed to do anything you need to do to repossess the car as along 
as it's peaceful," said Mel Jones, who has worked in the auto recovery business 
in Los Angeles County for 16 years. "You can't break and enter and if the owner 
comes out and says you can't take my car, and it's on his property, you have to 
leave it."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN DENIES ASSAULTING PHYSICIAN; COURT: 
FILLMORE RESIDENT WHO SAYS HE IS HIV- POSITIVE PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN HOSPITAL 
ATTACK. 
</P>

<P>
 A Fillmore man who told authorities that he is infected with the virus 
believed to cause AIDS pleaded not guilty Wednesday to an assault charge 
stemming from an incident in which he allegedly scratched, punched and 
attempted to bite an emergency room physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Bail was set at $25,000 in Newhall Municipal Court for David Detoth, 45, 
charged with assaulting a doctor Saturday night during a visit to the emergency 
room at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital.A preliminary hearing is scheduled 
for March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Detoth declined a request by the district attorney to submit to an HIV test, 
although he allegedly bragged "I've been HIV since 1983" after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that if Detoth continues to refuse testing a judge could 
order him to be tested if there is sufficient evidence that bodily fluids were 
exchanged during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 If he tests positive for the virus that causes AIDS he could face the 
additional charge of assault with the intent to do great bodily injury, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Dan Damon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge H. Keith Byram granted a request by Detoth's attorney that Detoth be 
examined by a physician while in custody. Defense attorney John Ponist told the 
judge that Detoth says he has cancer over much of his body and suffers from 
stomach bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the attack occurred about 9:50 p.m. after a friend brought 
Detoth to the hospital in pain. He became enraged when the hospital staff 
refused to give him painkillers and allegedly attacked a doctor. During the 
scuffle the doctor was scratched and punched several times about the head and 
face, but managed to fend off Detoth's attempts to bite him.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SHUTTLE CREW VISITS ROCKWELL PLANT; AEROSPACE: 
THE APPEARANCE COMES A DAY AFTER NASA ANNOUNCES ITS PACT RENEWAL WITH THE 
PALMDALE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It wasn't planned, but the timing couldn't have been better. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after NASA announced that major modification work on the space shuttle 
fleet will continue to be done by Rockwell International in Palmdale, the crew 
that will fly aboard the Atlantis got a firsthand look at the changes being 
made here to that shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit by the six-member flight crew had been planned for some time and was 
not tied to the decision that NASA announced Tuesday, Rockwell officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many of the comments during an hourlong gathering Wednesday of 
Rockwell officials, employees and the crew members centered on the 
announcement. NASA had considered having the modification work done at 
Florida's Kennedy Space Center, putting 300 or so Palmdale-based jobs in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could not have happened without you doing your job," Bob Minor, Rockwell 
Space Systems Division president, told employees. "Six months ago, I was 
worried. You did it and I'm proud of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the gathering, vehicle manager Mark Johnstone commented on NASA's 
decision, saying, "This is a big deal for our valley, for keeping jobs in 
California. We're reversing the trend. This was not an easy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 NASA Space Shuttle Director Tom Utsman said the decision was made, in part, to 
"allow the KSC team to concentrate all its efforts on the safe and efficient 
shuttle vehicle pre-launch processing." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons, it has clearly pleased Rockwell and its Palmdale 
employees, who applauded loudly when Minor first mentioned the space agency's 
decision. Having the shuttle flight crew on hand just made the day all the more 
special. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle crews often visit Rockwell's Palmdale facility to view modification 
work, said company spokeswoman Janet Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very motivational for (the employees) to see the crew," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 Rockwell Space Systems Division employees are nearing completion on 
$74 million in modifications to Atlantis, which is scheduled for an 11-day 
mission in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear to us you're doing fantastic work," Donald McMonagle, commander 
for the upcoming Atlantis mission, told the Rockwell employees during a 
ceremony Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 McMonagle said that seeing the employees who are doing the modification work 
makes the astronauts more comfortable. "When you go out onto the launch pad . . 
. you have that one moment, 'What if somebody forgot something?' It's these 
opportunities to come here and see you people and the work you do that lets us 
clear that thought in an instant." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission specialist Joseph Tanner told the employees, "Without you, we wouldn't 
have the opportunity to do what we do. You build the best orbiters in the 
world. You modify the best orbiters in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 During their visit, the flight crew, which includes a female payload commander 
as well as a mission specialist from the European Space Agency, honored four 
Space Systems Division employees with "Silver Snoopy" awards. The awards are 
"for individuals who have (given) an outstanding effort contributing to the 
success of manned space flight missions."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STRONGER CITY HALL TO REOPEN IN APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Quake-battered City Hall reopens next month -- better and stronger than ever, 
according to city engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 City departments are scheduled to reopen on April 25, but some of the Valencia 
Boulevard building's other tenants, including a bank, could move back into 
their offices a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said engineers had inspected each joint with ultrasound and that 
diagonal braces had been added to the structure for additional support. 
</P>
<P>
 The steel reinforcement is expected to make City Hall better at weathering 
earthquakes and easier to repair in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of the building will be better substantially because the 
materials we put back into it are better," said city engineer Tony Nisich, who 
estimates that the building is 25% stronger than before the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
"Our confidence is much higher because we spent more time doing testing and 
inspection." 
</P>
<P>
 Nisich said it cost about $4.5 million to repair the structure.

RAIDERS HOLD ON TO BROWN; PRO FOOTBALL: TEAM DECIDES TO MATCH DENVER'S 
"OBNOXIOUS" $11-MILLION OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, it was an offer the Raiders could not refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after receiving an offer sheet that restricted free agent Tim Brown 
had signed with the Denver Broncos, the Raiders matched it, giving the wide 
receiver $11 million over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders must adhere to every condition of the contract signed with the 
Broncos, which includes $2.75 million in the first year, a no-trade clause and 
a guarantee on the money paid in the final year. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Ortmayer, the Raiders' director of football operations, referred to 
several of the conditions as "a little bit obnoxious." 
</P>
<P>
 But the team felt it was worth the price to hang onto their leading receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 The retention of Brown came 24 hours after the Raiders spent $4.5 million to 
sign cornerback Albert Lewis, an unrestricted free agent, for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "So now we've got Albert Lewis and Tim Brown," owner Al Davis said. "Pretty 
good, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not so good for others who wear the silver and black. Now operating like all 
other teams under a salary cap of $33.9 million, the Raiders will have to cut 
back at other spots on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to get harder and harder to keep our excellent, older players," 
Davis said. "Somewhere along the way, it's a matter of them taking drastic cuts 
or letting them go. Nothing's based on loyalty anymore. It's just money." 
</P>
<P>
 The first casualty could be seldom-used veteran receiver Willie Gault, who 
will be 34 at the start of next season. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a lot of optimism in the Denver camp that Brown would be in a Bronco 
uniform, especially when he announced, after visiting Denver last week, that 
that was where he wanted to stay and that he was working with Bronco officials 
to design an offer sheet the Raiders would not match. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the Raiders insist, there are no hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's said publicly many times he wanted to be a Raider too," Ortmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he did was use the system," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard not to be happy," Brown said. "Let's be honest here. I was trying 
to get the best deal I could get for myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, this is the business part of football. Now, it's time to 
go play football." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the way he played football last season that enabled Brown to dictate 
his price. In his sixth season, he emerged as one of the league's premier 
receivers. He had career high totals in catches (80, a team record for a wide 
receiver) and yards (1,180 to lead the AFC). Brown also caught seven touchdown 
passes and scored one more on a punt return. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to the Raiders three times last season, including the first round 
of the playoffs, the Broncos wanted nothing more than to strengthen themselves 
while weakening their division rivals. But, Denver Coach Wade Phillips 
maintained, his side was realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we went into it thinking we were going to get Tim Brown," 
Phillips said. "We can hope. . . . It's disappointing, but it's a two-edged 
sword. We didn't get Tim Brown, so we stuck them with the other end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, of course, see it a bit differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't beat us," Davis said. "On the field or off." 
</P>

COMMENTARY; BYSTANDER KWAN THE REAL VICTIM IN SKATING MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I do not feel sorry for Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not feel as sorry for Nancy Kerrigan as I did on Jan. 6. That was the day 
she was injured in an assault that Portland, Ore., law enforcement authorities 
still contend Harding helped plot, even though they accepted her guilty plea 
Wednesday to a lesser crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan recovered from her knee wounds, won a silver medal in the Winter 
Olympics and, according to sports marketing experts, could earn more than $10 
million in her new career as a star of ice shows, television specials and 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been suggested by some of those same experts, cynically but probably 
also truthfully, that Kerrigan would not have been nearly so marketable without 
that whack on the knee. No, it is difficult at this point to still feel sorry 
for Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 I do, however, feel sorry for Michelle Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the victim of Skategate, perhaps the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harding resigned from the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. on Wednesday, it was 
not clear whether she eventually will be required to forfeit the national 
championship she won in January after the favorite, Kerrigan, was forced to 
withdraw. If so, Kwan, as a result of her second-place finish, would become the 
champion. At age 13, she would be the youngest-ever U.S. champion. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is little compensation for not having the opportunity, perhaps the 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, to skate in last month's Winter Olympics, which 
she, as the first alternate, would have done if Harding's lawyers had not been 
so efficient in preventing the U.S. Olympic Committee from doing the right 
thing and dropping their client from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying upon the advice of Shep Goldberg, the Santa Monica agent retained by 
Danny and Estella Kwan of Torrance to assist their young daughter through this 
difficult period, both she and her coach, Frank Carroll, have for the last 2 
1/2 months graciously declined to answer all questions pertaining to anything 
other than her skating. Goldberg feared that even one controversial response 
would turn the Tonya and Nancy story into the Tonya and Nancy and Michelle 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 So they all bit their lips before speaking, waiting for justice to prevail. It 
did Wednesday, three weeks too late for Kwan.  
</P>
<P>
 She went to Norway, but, because she was not an official team member, was not 
allowed to stay in the athletes' village or train on the official practice ice. 
She watched the competition from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 If Carroll heard it once, he heard it a thousand times that Kwan is only 13, 
that she has already established herself as the sport's rising star by becoming 
the world junior champion and that there will be other chances for her to skate 
in the Winter Olympics. But he has been coaching figure skaters for too long to 
take the future for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 For every Kristi Yamaguchi who goes from world junior champion to Olympic 
champion, there are dozens of other promising young skaters who fall by the 
wayside. Cindy Bortz of Tarzana and Jessica Mills of Northbrook, Ill., are two 
recent world junior champions from the United States who did not meet with the 
same success as seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Carroll's former students, Tiffany Chin of Toluca Lake, finished fourth 
in the 1984 Winter Olympics at 16 and was immediately pronounced the gold-medal 
favorite for 1988. But she developed a muscle imbalance in her hips, knee and 
ankles and retired before the next Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries happen. Bodies develop. Interests change. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wednesday's news about Harding broke, Kwan was on an airplane en route to 
Japan, where she will begin competition Monday in the World Championships. She 
is replacing Kerrigan, who withdrew. Whether Kwan will return to Japan in 1998 
for the Winter Olympics is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tribute, I suppose, to the American system of justice that Harding's 
rights were protected until she pleaded guilty. But who was protecting Michelle 
Kwan's rights? 
</P>
<P>
 * SURPRISE PLEA: Tonya Harding pleads guilty to "hindering prosecution" and 
resigns from U.S. figure skating as a result of the attack on rival skater 
Nancy Kerrigan. A1

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; LOPEZ MEASURES UP; MEN'S 
MIDWEST REGIONAL: PEPPERDINE STAR'S SMALL STATURE DOES NOT STOP HIM HAVING A 
BIG IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tom Asbury, Pepperdine basketball coach, often wonders what kind of player 
Damin Lopez would be if he were a little bigger than 5 feet 9 and 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, if Lopez were much taller, he probably wouldn't be playing for the 
Waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was a 6-3 kid, he'd probably be playing for Kentucky and I would have 
only seen him on television," Asbury said. "I also know that if they hadn't had 
a coaching change at Arizona State, he might be playing there." 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior at Apollo High in Glendale, Ariz., in 1989, Lopez considered 
attending nearby Arizona State. Then the Sun Devils hired Bill Frieder, and 
Frieder's style of play didn't suit Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 So he opted for Pepperdine, where he has prospered. After his first year as a 
redshirt, Lopez has helped lead the Waves to four consecutive postseason 
berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, 23, will make his third and final appearance in the NCAA tournament 
when the 14th-seeded Waves (19-10) play third-seeded Michigan (21-7) in the 
first round of the Midwest Regional today in the Kansas Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine is not expected to challenge the Wolverines, who have reached the 
NCAA championship game two consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lopez isn't giving up hope. Not after Pepperdine has come this far. 
</P>
<P>
 With four starters returning from a team that finished 23-8 and advanced to 
the second round of the National Invitation Tournament, the Waves had high 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team struggled early in the season. Lopez said tragedies that beset 
Asbury and his family affected the Waves' play. Asbury's daughter, Stacey, died 
of complications from anorexia nervosa last September and Asbury's father, Ed, 
died in November -- two weeks before the season started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it definitely had an effect on myself at the beginning of the season 
with what coach Asbury was going through," he said. "We just wanted to take 
care of business on the court so he wouldn't have to worry about that, and it 
didn't work out as well as we would have liked." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who averages 14.5 points and has been one of the team's leading scorers 
the last two seasons, said he also put too much pressure on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little down because I felt that part of the reason we weren't doing 
well was that I wasn't playing well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem only grew worse for Lopez, who fell into a prolonged shooting 
slump at the start of West Coast Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and his backcourt partner, senior Bryan Parker, struggled to the point 
that Asbury benched them at Gonzaga on Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he played most of the game, Lopez acknowledges that he disagreed with 
his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He questioned our will to win and whether we cared about what was going on 
with the team," Lopez said. "It bothered me because we all wanted to win and my 
attitude was the same as it always was. But it was his judgment call, and it 
worked out for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was not the only factor in Pepperdine's turnaround, Asbury's ploy 
served its purpose. Since a loss to Portland on Feb. 12, the Waves have won 
seven in a row -- the final three in the WCC tournament to earn an NCAA 
tournament bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury said it is no coincidence that Lopez has found his shooting touch late 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a strong correlation between Damin's ability to shoot the ball well 
and our success," he said. "We're a lot better when he's open and shooting it 
like he is. What it does is give us the proper inside and outside balance 
between him and a player like (forward) Dana Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez also credits his improvement to more aggressive play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to penetrate a little more than I had in the past and I worked a 
lot harder in the weight room," he said. "I think that gave me the stamina to 
go a little longer and harder." 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't simply Lopez's physical skills that have earned him teammates' 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really the one who keeps everyone cool on the court," Parker said. "My 
role is a lot more vocal and I like to get us hyped up. Damin's the guy who 
makes sure we're not playing out of control. He's like a coach on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 If he has the instincts of a coach, there is a good reason. His father, David, 
was a longtime coach at Apollo. He has since become coach at Phoenix St. 
Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury says Lopez could also become an outstanding coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He grew up with the game, and he's very aware about what's happening on the 
court," he said. "I truly believe that if he was a high school coach now, he'd 
already be as good as half the coaches in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is not sure if he wants to coach after he completes his college career. 
He wants to play pro basketball, although he realizes it is a longshot because 
of his size. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that's what he heard in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "But all I want is a shot," he said. "I feel if I get a shot, I can take it a 
long way." 
</P>
<P>
 When Pepperdine plays Michigan today, Lopez will be the shortest player on the 
floor by at least five inches. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect that to discourage him. 
</P>
<P>
 Size has not stopped him yet.

NFL SEES THE LIGHT ON TWO-POINT CONVERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four most exciting words in college football -- "They're going for two" -- 
apparently will be added to the NFL vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 In league meetings in Orlando, Fla., next week, owners are expected to approve 
use of the two-point conversion play, marking the first scoring rules change in 
the league's 75-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL announced Wednesday that its influential Competition Committee -- led 
by Miami Dolphin Coach Don Shula -- will recommend the new conversion play to 
the 28 owners, virtually ensuring its passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is expected to easily win a two-thirds majority vote from club 
officials who have grown weary of hearing coaches complain that the game is 
being dominated by field-goal kickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing has an excellent opportunity to pass," said Jerry Jones, Dallas 
Cowboy owner and committee member. "There is a lot of sentiment from coaches 
throughout the league for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about an eight-point play, not a two-point play. This thing 
will keep a lot of teams in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike colleges, which have allowed a two-point conversion attempt from the 
three-yard line since 1958, the NFL will run the play from the two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule is expected to influence more coaches to go for touchdowns instead of 
field goals, which have often decided games in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, there were three field goals for every four touchdowns scored, a 
sizable difference from the two-touchdown-per-one-field goal ratio 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Field goals accounted for 24.1% of all scoring, the highest percentage in 
league history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like the idea at first, but the more I looked at it, the more I 
realized it would help our league," said Shula, whose change of heart was 
imperative to the recommendation. "Being able to get two points instead of one 
point can sure make things look a lot different to a team that is down early." 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly makes things look a lot different to kickers. If the reaction of 
Phoenix Cardinal kicker Greg Davis is any indication, they are going to be 
furious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in New York must be trying to justify their $100,000 salaries 
when they figured this out," Davis said. "Some people must not have very much 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis noted, as will many critics, that the two-point conversion works in 
college because there is no overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "With overtime in our game, there is no need for it. . . . They are trying to 
reinvent the wheel," he said. "The reason everybody is kicking more field goals 
is because they can't score inside the 10-yard line. What makes them think that 
this rule will help them do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the conversion is receiving support even from such traditionalists as Ram 
Coach Chuck Knox, who said, "I kind of like the idea. It is an interesting 
thought and would bring some excitement to the game from the standpoint of the 
fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Jones: "From a Cowboys' perspective, we don't play to win by field 
goals. We play to win by touchdowns. So we pushed for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that kickers connected on 77.6% of their attempts last season, nearly 
20 percentage points higher than in 1970, NFL Vice President Joe Browne stated 
the league's case simply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Nick Lowery (Kansas City Chief kicker), but he's getting too much air 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other attempts to take the game away from the kickers, the league is also 
expected to approve moving the kickoff to the 30-yard line from the 35-yard 
line and making a one-inch tee mandatory to reduce kickoff hang time. Kickers 
used tees ranging from one to three inches last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the rule changes were mandated because there were only 68.5% of 
kickoffs returned last season, far fewer than 15 years ago, when 87.5% were 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis disagreed. "It will be less hang time with the short tee, but more 
touchbacks because we can now drive the ball farther," he said. "Some of these 
guys need to take beginning physics."

JIM MURRAY: ALL-WORLD IN BASKETBALL AND COMEDY

<P>
 What would you have to guess is the greatest basketball team of all time? The 
Bill Russell Celtics of the 1960s? Perhaps. The Chamberlain-Baylor-West Lakers 
of the '70s? Possible. Won 33 consecutive games. Or the Kareem-Magic-Jamaal 
Wilkes Lakers of the '80s? A case could be made. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, but what of the Harlem Globetrotters men of all seasons? An annual record 
of 250-0. An all-time record of 17,515 or so victories vs. 331 losses? A 
winning streak once of 2,495 games? Is that any good? 
</P>
<P>
 How about a basketball team that once drew 75,000 fans? In Berlin, yet. 
</P>
<P>
 While we're on the subject, what would you guess is the greatest comedy team 
of all time? Burns and Allen? Laurel and Hardy? Martin and Lewis? Rowan and 
Martin? The Keystone Kops? 
</P>
<P>
 How about the Harlem Globetrotters? They might have made more people laugh 
than all of the rest of them put together. And there was never a blue line or 
double-entendre in their routine. And their humor transcends boundaries. They 
find it as funny in Bombay as they do in Booth Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 You mention the Harlem Globetrotters and everybody smiles. Revolutions have 
been stopped in countries while they appeared. They have played before kings 
and convicts. In palaces and in prisons. They have played on the top of roofs 
and the bottom of swimming pools. They have played in the burning sands of 
Africa and the ice floes of Alaska. They have played on camelback, horseback, 
and on a court made of desktops. 
</P>
<P>
 No team in history has done more for their sport, not the '27 Yankees, the 
Four Horsemen of Notre Dame, the Dream Team or the Lombardi Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 Who did more for the game of basketball? Who popularized the game in more 
places all over the globe? Before there were Dream Teams, before even there was 
an NBA, the Globetrotters were. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know there was a time in this country, not too long ago, when the 
Harlem Globetrotters played in a double-bill with NBA teams -- and the 
Globetrotters were on last, the headline act? The Knicks-Lakers would be on the 
undercard. People didn't come to see them. They came to see Meadowlark Lemon, 
Goose Tatum, Marques Haynes or the great ballhandlers. The dunk shot might have 
originated with the Globies, the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 Were they merely clowns? Hardly. They beat the reigning professional champions 
(the old George Mikan Minneapolis Lakers) once in two head-to-head games -- and 
the professionals never again ran up against them. They annually trounced a 
college All-Star team for a dozen years in a series of matchups against the 
cream of America's graduating classes. And beat them 146-56. And, in the last 
season, the total was 15 of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 They are as much a part of Americana as a harvest moon. Globetrotter 
memorabilia hangs in the Smithsonian along with Lindbergh's airplane and 
Lincoln's handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that this historic group that came to symbolize the seven-foot 
jumpshooter was founded by a guy barely 5-3 and so round that, when someone 
dubbed him "Mr. Basketball," they didn't know whether that was a nickname or a 
description. 
</P>
<P>
 Abe Saperstein was as legendary as his team. He always hankered to be a sports 
entrepreneur, to own a baseball team but he began small, forming this all-black 
barnstorming basketball team in 1927 that he immediately set about to having it 
tour the sticks for pass-the-hat money. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks were not barred from pro basketball. There was no pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 They were as deadly serious as the Boston Celtics at first. Until one night in 
a game in a frigid meeting hall in Iowa, a player accidentally backed into a 
red-hot potbellied stove and took off whooping and hollering with a trail of 
smoke curling off his backside. The crowd thought it was funny. So the 
Globetrotters added comic turns to the game. Chaplin was never funnier. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a prizefighter who tours with his chauffeur, the Globies went out and got 
a team of, so to speak, chauffeurs, a foil for their hilarious comedy and 
deadly shooting. Flouting entrepreneurial fears, they picked an all-white (or 
largely white) "opponent" and it was so accepted, it was a lesson for the 
promoters that Americans don't care what color excellence comes in, they want 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only one lesson in promotion the Globetrotters were to teach the sports 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Their participation in NBA doubleheaders definitely helped establish the 
league, which had struggled in near-bankruptcy on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite evident to any spectator that the Globetrotters' dexterity, 
quickness and magnificent coordination was gifted basketball, and there is no 
question their demonstration of prowess accelerated integration and broke down 
barriers. No pro team ever inspired the devotion and affection the 
Globetrotters could. They were as popular in Moscow, Russia, as Moscow, Ida. 
The Trotters introduced basketball all over the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilt Chamberlain began his pro career with them. So did the Hall of Fame 
pitcher, Bob Gibson, who was an All-American basketball player at Creighton and 
had played against the Globies as a collegiate all-star. 
</P>
<P>
 The Globetrotters are in our neck of the woods this week, playing in the 
Anaheim Arena on Saturday and in the Sports Arena on Sunday afternoon. They are 
still America's Team, and were long before the Dallas Cowboys preempted the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 They are in their 68th year as an organization, and home is wherever they hang 
a basket and clear a floor. For the Globetrotters every basketball court in the 
world is home. Charles (Tex) Harrison was commenting on this quality in advance 
of the team's visit the other afternoon. A longtime player and onetime coach of 
the Globies, Tex says "You can be in Timbuktu but, even if the person speaks no 
English if the music starts up to our theme song, Sweek Georgia Brown, his eyes 
will light up and he'll say 'the Globetrotters!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Their legacy is unique. Almost every sportswriter in the country has, at one 
time or another, faced the query, "How do you think the Globetrotters would do 
against a regular NBA team?" 
</P>
<P>
 Says Harrison: "At one time, the answer was easy: beat them bad. We have to 
get back to that level. There's no doubt that integration hurt us. We used to 
get first pick of all the great players. Now the NBA grabs them. But we're just 
glad to have contributed to that state of affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just one of the many legacies these citizens of the world bequeathed to 
society. They were 45 years ahead of their time. Part circus, part sitcom -- 
but basketball for the ages. A slam-dunk show business.

ERIC SHOW IS FOUND DEAD AT 37; BASEBALL: FORMER PADRE PITCHER KNOWN FOR 
ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOR WAS IN A DRUG TREATMENT CENTER. CAUSE OF DEATH HAS NOT BEEN 
DETERMINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Eric Show, whose turmoil-filled career spanned 11 major league seasons with 
the San Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics, was found dead Wednesday morning in 
his bed at a private drug treatment center near San Diego. He was 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Show's body was discovered at 8:23 a.m. at the Rancho L'Abri retreat in 
Dulzura, a rural community 30 miles southeast of the city where he achieved his 
greatest fame. 
</P>
<P>
 While pitching for the Padres in 1984, Show won 15 games and led the team to 
its only National League championship. He finished his career with a 101-89 
record and 3.66 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death was not immediately determined, pending an autopsy, 
according to the San Diego County medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 Show's off-field behavior was questioned by the time he was released by 
Oakland during spring training in 1992. He had disappeared from camp for three 
days, then reported with cuts on both hands. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked to be released from a $700,000 contract, and never played again. 
Apparently none of his former friends on the Padres had heard from him since. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Dravecky, probably his closest friend on the team, received a set of golf 
clubs from Show several years ago during Dravecky's battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But, typical of Show, he enclosed only a brief note with no information about 
himself. Dravecky was unable to track him down to thank him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this just goes to show that nobody ever really knew Eric," said Tim 
Flannery, another longtime teammate. "It's tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 Show will be most remembered not for his achievements, but his eccentricities. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 in San Diego, early in the Padres' championship run, he was spotted at 
a local fair with teammates Dravecky and Mark Thurmond passing out pamphlets 
for the John Birch Society. Show later acknowledged that he was a member of the 
controversial group. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985 in Cincinnati, he threw the pitch that Pete Rose knocked into left 
field for Rose's 4,192nd hit, breaking Ty Cobb's all-time record. While 
everyone in Riverfront Stadium stood and cheered, Show sat on the mound with 
his arms folded, drawing much criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987 in Chicago, when the Cubs' Andre Dawson was baseball's hottest hitter, 
Show hit Dawson in the head with a pitch at Wrigley Field, nearly causing a 
riot among outraged fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Show was as interested in philosophy and physics as fastballs, often spending 
his time off on the road studying in local libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric had a very keen mind," said Jerry Coleman, longtime Padres announcer. 
"But it always took a left turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Show, a native of Riverside, is survived by his wife, Cara Mia.

SPRING GAME OF SIGNIFICANCE; JACKIE ROBINSON INTEGRATED BASEBALL ON THIS DATE 
48 YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sporting event of historic sociological significance took place here 48 
years ago today when Jackie Robinson officially integrated major league 
baseball in a spring training exhibition at City Island ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 When Robinson played five innings at second base for the Montreal Royals 
against the Brooklyn Dodgers, it was the first time a black player had 
participated in professional baseball on the same field with white players, but 
except for the black press the incident went relatively unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the tidy little ballpark on the banks of the Halifax River has been 
renamed Jackie Robinson Stadium and is the home of the Daytona Cubs of the 
Class-A Florida State League. In front of the stadium stands a life-sized 
statue of Robinson -- in the road uniform of the Royals -- with two small 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 A plaque below, dedicated Sept. 15, 1990 by Robinson's widow, Rachel, tells 
the story better than it was told in 1946: 
</P>
<P>
 "Formerly known as City Island Ball Park, this is the site of the first 
racially integrated spring training game which was played on March 17, 1946, 
between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Montreal Royals. Hall of Fame legend Jackie 
Robinson played for Montreal, the Brooklyn Dodgers' farm team, thus marking an 
historic event in the struggle to achieve equality of opportunity in modern 
major league baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Daytona Beach community was proud to have hosted that legendary game and 
spring training, both of which were viewed as milestones in the history of 
sports and civil rights."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, Florida had strict segregation laws for travel, lodging, eating 
places and recreational facilities. The game was held at Daytona Beach after 
earlier attempts by Montreal to play Robinson led to games being canceled at 
Jacksonville and DeLand. The one in DeLand was called off because the stadium 
lights were out of order -- although it was a day game. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, most of the baseball community hoped that Robinson and Branch 
Rickey's Great Experiment with segregation would simply go away. No one knew 
then that in a few years Robinson would be the National League's most valuable 
player, lead the Dodgers to the World Series and become a Hall of Fame 
performer. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been an all-Southern California high school catcher at Pasadena Muir 
Tech and an all-junior college shortstop at Pasadena JC, but when he hit below 
.200 in his senior year at UCLA and was unimpressive in early spring training 
with Montreal, his future -- and the future of black athletes in all team 
sports -- was far from assured. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daytona Evening News thought so little of the game that the story appeared 
on page 10 and Bernard Kahn's story did not mention Robinson until the fifth 
paragraph. The story focused on Dixie Walker, who hit a triple after having 
ended a holdout that saw him become the Dodgers' highest-paid player. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn, the longtime sports editor for whom the press box is named at Daytona 
International Raceway, wrote of Robinson:  
</P>
<P>
 "A house of 3,000 filled the Island Park, and all eyes were focused upon 
Jackie Robinson, hefty Montreal second sacker and the first negro to appear in 
an organized baseball game. Playing under terrific pressure, Robinson conducted 
himself well afield during his five-inning stint. He handled two chances aptly. 
</P>
<P>
 "At bat, Robinson popped out in the second and fourth frames. The ex-Army 
lieutenant slammed a hard hit grounder in the sixth and was safe when Howie 
Schultz was forced at second. Robinson stole second, drawing a wide round of 
applause from the audience. Catcher Ferrell Anderson singled to short center, 
and Robinson, running like a scared rabbit, breezed across the plate with the 
Royals' second and final run of the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn won the game, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 (In Los Angeles, where Robinson had made his reputation as a four-sport 
letterman at UCLA, The Times made no mention of the game, except for a 
linescore among the exhibition baseball results. The big story that Sunday was 
Sam Hanks winning a midget auto race before 35,000 in the Coliseum.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even though this game broke the race barrier, it was not the end of Robinson's 
problems in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, in Sanford, the chief of police arrived in the second inning 
and told Royal Manager Clay Hopper that Robinson and John Wright, a black 
pitcher who had been signed with Robinson, had to be removed from the ballpark 
or the game would be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The spring of 1946 had marked the return of major league teams to Florida for 
training after they had to remain in the north for several years because of 
World War II travel restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickey choose Daytona Beach for the Dodgers' training site after being assured 
that his two black players would be permitted to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Titus, Daytona city manager, issued a warning, however, when he told 
Rickey: "Robinson will run into some strict segregation laws if he arrives with 
the Montreal team. He will not be allowed to stay in the same hotel with the 
white players and will be forced to use other services set aside for Negroes 
only." 
</P>
<P>
 When Robinson and his wife wanted to watch the Dodgers against other major 
league teams in spring games, they had to sit in the right-field bleachers 
where, by law, all black fans were segregated in the Jim Crow Section. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Daytona ballpark, freshly scrubbed and painted in blue and white Cub 
colors, is a throwback to an earlier era with its wooden outfield fence 
plastered with local advertising. It was originally built in 1936 when the 
Daytona Beach Islanders became a charter member of the Florida State League. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of major league teams, including the St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn 
Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City A's, Houston Astros and Los Angeles 
Dodgers, supported the Daytona team before the Cubs took control in 1993. The 
city's 46th season will begin April 12 against Sarasota. Daytona has won five 
pennants during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Musial was a left-handed pitcher for the Islanders in 1940 and won 18 
games before a fall in the sandy outfield injured his shoulder late in the 
season and caused him to be shifted to the outfield for his hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs, with a seating capacity of 4,067, attracted 95,089 fans in 65 games 
last season, one of the league's highest averages. A municipal facility, Jackie 
Robinson Stadium is also home to teams from Embry Riddle Aeronautical 
University and Bethune-Cookman College, a mostly-black school where Robinson 
spent many of his off-hours in 1946.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT UPDATE; MIDWEST; SOUTHWEST TEXAS IS 
TAKING IT EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwest Texas State (25-6) is seeded 15th, has never played in the NCAA 
tournament and today faces second-seeded Massachusetts (27-6) in the first 
round at Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did the Bobcats prepare? 
</P>
<P>
 By cutting back on practice, reflecting on the past and letting the future 
take care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want us to play as well as we can play," Coach Jim Wooldridge said. 
"Win or lose, if we do that, I think our players and myself will feel good. If 
we don't win, I want us to feel good about who we are. That's as important to 
me as anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's nothing laid-back about St. Louis, which last played in the NCAA 
tournament in 1957. The seventh-seeded Billikens (23-5) play 10th-seeded 
Maryland (16-11) today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we've finally got a chance to play in the tournament, we're not just 
happy to be in it. We've come here to win some games," said second-year Coach 
Charlie Spoonhour, a frequent NCAA visitor with Southwest Missouri State. 
"We're going to do what it takes to win."

 Purdue's Glenn Robinson has faced every kind of defense known to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen the 1-3-1, 2-3 and 1-2-2 zones, a box and one, a triangle and two, 
the press. They've double-teamed him, triple-teamed him," Boilermaker Coach 
Gene Keady said. "We've seen it all and survived almost all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who led the nation in scoring and is a unanimous All-American, and 
the Boilermakers have done more than survive. They went 26-4 on the way to 
winning the Big Ten title and being top-seeded in the Southeast Regional. 
Purdue plays Central Florida (21-9) in the first round today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights can hope that the only defense available works -- Robinson 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel there is no one in college basketball that can stop me," Robinson 
said. "I can stop myself. It's all on me. I have to play the way I'm capable of 
playing. Everything is up to me first." 
</P>
<P>
 The College of Charleston, the unlikeliest of the 34 at-large teams selected 
for the NCAA tournament, dominated news conferences at Rupp Arena on the eve of 
its game against Wake Forest, and Coach John Kresse might still be giving 
interviews somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake Forest is a team from a league the Charleston coach and players are 
familiar with because of television. That's the same reason so few people 
seemed to know anything about the College of Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watch the ACC on television and our guys are in awe of the names and the 
pros," Kresse said in an opening statement that lasted nearly 10 minutes and 
included the word super at least 10 times. "It's been a media blitz for us, but 
it's been super. We have made time to practice, but we haven't had time to eat 
and sleep and we've gotten to go to the bathroom just three times a day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (24-3) come into the tournament with a national-best 16-game 
winning streak and haven't lost since Jan. 15.

 Guard Paul O'Liney was suspended for Missouri's first-round game against Navy 
at Ogden, Utah, after pleading guilty to misdemeanor assault and paying a $100 
fine, his lawyer said.

 O'Liney, who is averaging 9.4 points in a reserve role, was arrested early

 Hawaii (18-14) is in its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1972, playing

 They want to make it through the two games at Ogden, Utah, and descend on the

 "There's a lot of excitement in Hawaii," Hawaii Coach Riley Wallace said. "I 
understand there's a tidal wave heading to Los Angeles because of all the

 If so, it probably was caused by a Syracuse fan, Trevor Ruffin, a shooting

 Pepperdine is making its first trip to Wichita, but Coach Tom Asbury already 
is well acquainted with this prairie town along the Arkansas River. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury nearly became the coach at Wichita State two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He went through a series of interviews and was offered the position, only to 
decline because of his daughter's illness and uncertainty in the Wichita State 
athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been difficult to move the family at that time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury said he did not turn down the position for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made me a great offer," he said. "The timing just wasn't right with 
other things." 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Asbury appears to have made a wise decision as the Waves have 
continued to prosper the last two seasons and the Shockers have had consecutive 
losing seasons. MITCH POLIN

BELMONT IS STRIPPED OF SOCCER TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Belmont High was stripped of its City Section boys' soccer championship 
Wednesday and could lose its Northern Conference football title after a rules 
committee found one of its athletes ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time in the City Section's 24-year history of soccer that a 
school has lost its title. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont could lose its football title, depending on the number of games the 
ineligible athlete -- Octavio Calvillo -- played last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the violation was discovered at the end of the season, no school will 
be awarded the soccer title. Bell High, which lost, 1-0, to Belmont in the 
final March 5, will remain the runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pending an appeal that Belmont may make," said Barbara Fiege, City 
Section athletic commissioner. "But I don't expect they'll make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege, who was Belmont's athletic director for eight years before becoming 
commissioner last October, said she spoke to school officials Wednesday and was 
told they were not going to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvillo, Belmont's starting fullback, violated section rules by competing in 
his ninth semester, one more than allowed. Calvillo skipped an academic year 
because of family problems when he was enrolled at Los Angeles University High. 
When he transferred to Belmont last fall, a petition to extend his eligibility 
was not completed.

 The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. turned to its second alternate, Nicole Bobek, 
16, of Colorado Springs, Colo., when national champion Tonya Harding withdrew 
Wednesday from the World Championships scheduled to begin Sunday in Chiba, 
Japan.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PIAZZA SHIES FROM ATTENTION

 Mike Piazza put in a full day's work in only five innings against the Atlanta 
Braves, hitting a home run and sacrifice fly and throwing out a runner 
attempting to steal, before turning the catching gear over to Carlos Hernandez. 
But the game was far from over, lasting 3 hours 48 minutes until Mike 
Sharperson's single in the 12th inning gave the Dodgers an 8-7 victory at Vero 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Piazza was gone, having first signed autographs for about an hour 
outside the Dodgertown clubhouse. Four weeks into spring training, Piazza is 
still doing his best to accommodate the fans, but he says sometimes the 
attention makes him edgy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of tough with everybody always wanting something from me all the 
time," he said. "I read a story the other day that said I just wanted to be 
left alone, but that's not true. I enjoy the people, but sometimes there are 
just a few bad eggs that ruin it for everybody. They don't understand I have to 
get my work done first." MARYANN HUDSON

 Fed up with questions about his testicular cancer, Philadelphia Phillie first

followed him into the Phillies' clubhouse at Clearwater, Fla.

 Kruk declined to talk to reporters, even after team President Bill Giles asked 
him if he would. The bat he tossed landed on the ground several feet from the

<P>
 Before Wednesday night's outing against the Brewers, Angel Manager Buck 
Rodgers said he was "looking for results and control" from Frank Tanana, whose 
future with the Angels is in doubt. Tanana gave up five hits and three runs in 
the first inning, then settled down and finished four innings of work, giving 
up seven hits and four earned runs.Milwaukee won, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very encouraged by the last three innings," Rodgers said. "I saw some 
good spin (on the curve) and a good changeup. The good stuff is starting to 
come and he wasn't afraid to throw the ball over the plate. After the first, he 
was fooling some pretty good hitters. This one came under the heading of 'Not 
Too Bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers will give Tanana another look, most likely on Tuesday against the 
Chicago Cubs. JOHN WEYLER

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; DEAL FOR YOUNG DRAWS CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, barring a change of heart, are expected to complete the trade by 
this weekend that will send first baseman J.T. Snow to the New York Mets for 
starter Anthony Young. Angel and Met officials confirmed The Times' report 
Wednesday that the deal has been proposed, and now the Mets are awaiting the 
Angels' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 1-0 with a 2.73 earned-run average this spring while yielding nine hits 
in nine innings, is scheduled to pitch today against the Dodgers in Vero Beach, 
Fla. The Angels have sent Moose Stubing to scout the game. "We like Anthony 
Young an awful lot," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said, "and we believe 
he'll be even better with a change of scenery. I think it's pretty obvious that 
we need to add a pitcher, and he has as good an arm as anyone that we're 
looking at." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Young was 1-16 last season, and set a major league record by losing 
27 consecutive games over two seasons, he had a respectable 3.77 ERA, including 
a 1.65 ERA after the All-Star break. The Mets gave up a major league worst 1.79 
unearned runs during Young's 39 games, and averaged only 2.9 runs in his 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow is batting .161 this spring. He is expected to become the Mets' everyday 
first baseman. BOB NIGHTENGALECALIFORNIA ANGELS (BASEBALL TEAM)

THE SCENE: WAY-OUT WESTERN; MOVING AWAY FROM THE HERD, O.C. HIGH SCHOOLERS 
DANCE THEIR WAY INTO UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judging by the clothes, the mannerisms and the slang of the teens you see 
two-steppin' into Orange County's county-music scene, you'd think they were 
born in Texas or Tennessee. From their fancy-stitched boots to their responses 
of "yes, ma'am," they seem worlds removed from their grunge contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Most high schoolers show up at local nightclubs clad in jeans (Wrangler, 
preferably) and cowboy boots -- although chunky sneakers will do. There's the 
ubiquitous black felt or straw cowboy hat, but a few guys will opt for their 
school ball caps or those bearing the name of a professional team such as the 
Dallas Cowboys. Colorful, Western-cut shirts are hot, as are the massive silver 
belt buckles many of the young dudes sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene has boomed with the opening in the past year of country nightclubs 
that offer family days during the weekends and evenings open to all ages 
through the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Places such as the Depot in San Juan Capistrano, the Barn in Tustin, Denim & 
Diamonds in Huntington Beach, the Country Rock Cafe in Lake Forest, In Cahoots 
in Fullerton and even the Phoenix Club in Anaheim allow younger fans, such as 
University High School senior Timothy (Rocky) Harn, to get in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky acquired a taste for country after a friend invited him to a nightclub 
in Anaheim, which at the time allowed all ages. "A lot of places discriminate 
if you're under age. It's all economics because we don't buy alcohol. But we 
(younger patrons) bring in a lot of new moves, so it's a plus to have us here." 
</P>
<P>
 The steps, turns and splits Rocky and his friends maneuver are hypnotic. 
</P>
<P>
 They've charged the simple Electric Slide into a powerful routine that could 
sell a song. Rocky's moves get plenty of notice as part of the Country Kickers, 
a newly formed group of South County high schoolers and adults that meets to 
practice new steps. They will dance in the Swallows Day Parade parade March 26 
and have been invited to kick off the San Francisco 49ers' season this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the atmosphere," Rocky says, throwing his hand -- with the sizable, 
sterling saddle ring -- in the direction of the dance floor. Eight months ago, 
Rocky listened to rap and reggae pretty exclusively; now it's once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
 He figures "about 99%" of the friends he has now he's met through the country 
nightclubs. "I just wish more people would get into it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills High School sophomore Candace Reinhart is also a newcomer sold on 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 She showed up at the Country Rock Cafe a couple of months ago with friends. 
Now her parents drop her off there every weekend, and she's learned about a 
dozen dances. "My favorite is the Tush Push, because it's faster than the 
others," she manages to say, in between embracing friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugs are popular greetings among the younger crowd; indeed, it's the cozy 
camaraderie that's a big draw for them. Something about being down-home and 
friendly. That hipper-than-thou attitude so a part of other scenes just doesn't 
fit here.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is more upbeat and fun than just driving around or whatever other kids 
do on the weekends," says Candace, 16. "And I love to dance." 
</P>
<P>
 She also loves country music now more than ever and counts "a whole bunch of 
CDs" in her record collection. "Not a lot of people listen to it," she says, so 
being into country sets her apart from her peers at school. Ironically, an 
unnatural hair color or a pierced nose won't deem a kid alternative at some 
schools. Standing out might be as simple as gushing to a Garth Brooks ballad.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like the country theme -- the clothes, the horses, which I try to ride 
whenever I get the chance," Candace says. "I have about four pairs of cowboy 
boots." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine High senior Travis Runnels, 17, got his first pair of cowboy boots the 
night he got his first dose of country music. His mother, who was heavy into 
the Western wave, dragged him to the Crazy Horse for his 16th birthday. "It was 
the first time I ever listened to country," he recalls. "I really had no 
opinion of it before then. Once I saw how many girls were into it, well," he 
pauses, then continues with a drawl, "I liked it more." 
</P>
<P>
 Girls are among the top four or five reasons Travis' buddy Matt Cohen, 17, 
drives the two of them to clubs as much as possible -- sometimes six times a 
week and, on occasion, Matt says, "as far as Colton." The two-step is their 
favorite dance. After all, it's a great way for them to meet the opposite sex.  
</P>
<P>
 If anything, dancing has boosted their confidence, they say. "If you're a good 
dancer," notes Travis, "all the girls want to dance with you. That's the best 
part."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the telephone numbers he's gathered, Travis has collected several 
trophies from contests that, apparently, are pretty nice too. For the 
competitions, his mom sews his Western shirts, which have become part of his 
daily wardrobe. He even wears the big, black wool brim to class sometimes. 
There are a few cracks from his peers, but generally, he says, "people at 
school know better (than) to act immature that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for Travis, but not so for many teen country fans who learn rather 
quickly how little their classmates know about this distinctly native culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills senior Mesha Harper says she's "gotten really criticized at 
school" since changing her radio dial from rock station Power 106 to KIK-FM. So 
she avoids flaunting it. "They think it's a hick scene and that we 
square-dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Though this self-described die-hard might keep her hat and boots in the closet 
until the weekends, she finds solace in the number of friends she's made since 
her parents introduced her to the clubs last May; many are from different high 
schools. "Everyone welcomes you here. I think that's why this scene is growing 
so tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If not through friends, many high schoolers got hooked on country through an 
otherwise rare influence: their parents. Rare, because a parent's concept of 
what's hip is usually passe. So either parents are getting cooler or kids are 
re-evaluating their attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are these teen cowpokes taking a cue from Mom and Dad, young and old 
are having a blast side by side. Sure, there are some downers, like when the 
moment's right for a kiss and Mom is sure to say something -- even if it's in 
jest. There are those who take five outside the club and around the bend to 
light up a cigarette or chew tobacco (and spit) away from watchful adult eyes. 
But girls and guys still flirt; notes scribbled with telephone numbers are 
still exchanged, and promises to meet next weekend still go on, regardless of 
their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Country has a lot of good values -- even for urban cowboys," says Woodbridge 
High junior Ryan Dobson. It's clear that Ryan, an Irvine resident who spends 
his free time riding horses, roping and doing other rodeo-type activities, 
doesn't include himself in this "urban cowboy" category. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old teaches youngsters -- those who still need baby-sitting -- how 
to rope in the parking lot of the Country Rock Cafe almost every weekend. "This 
is a great scene because it keeps a lot of kids off of a lot of other things 
that could get them into trouble, and from dressing like gangsters," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, and you get guys in their Wranglers," yells out his "honey," Samantha 
Burlas, a junior at Los Amigos High School.  
</P>
<P>
 In unison, Samantha and her friends declare their love for "cowboy butt." 
Translated: guys in snug-fitting jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, this is a family place," interrupts Ryan. "Ma'am," he tells me, "it's 
not the clothes that make the cowboy."  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but in these parts, son, the duds and the drawl certainly help.

 Dying for a cup of coffee? 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers say some people may be doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent study on "Coffee, Tea and Mortality" in the Annals of 
Epidemiology, coffee drinkers may be less likely to commit suicide than those 
who do not imbibe. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, researchers found that the risk of suicide seemed to decrease as 
coffee consumption increased. (The relationship between suicide and tea 
drinking, however, appeared to be a tepid one.) 
</P>
<P>
 The report is based on a 10-year study of 128,000 Kaiser Permanente patients 
in Northern California. While conceding that the link between coffee and 
suicide could be spurious, chief researcher Dr. Arthur Klatsky has called for 
more study with depressed patients to pin down the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, it's not because gallons of coffee make a person too jittery to load a 
gun or uncap a bottle of tranquilizers. Only "caffeine-naive" people suffer the 
racing pulse and shakiness that can come from a big dose of caffeine, says 
Klatsky. Chronic coffee drinkers experience only pleasant stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers confirmed that anyone with heart disease should continue to avoid 
excessive coffee breaks, limiting consumption to less than four cups per day.  
</P>
<P>
 And while Klatsky isn't recommending that depressed people rush to the nearest 
cappuccino bar for self-medication, his team's findings do give new meaning to 
the phrase "Wake up and smell the coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 It could be a lifesaver. PAMELA WARRICK

<P>
 It's 1200 hours and Nancy Sherwood and Joseph Day are at their battle stations 
near the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the invasion begins, building to a crescendo in about 15 minutes as a 
blue- and gray-suited army sweeps past the line of presidential portraits and 
pseudo-mahogany wainscoting to where Sherwood awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 A commanding maitresse d' in a short black dress and pearls, she confers 
constantly by phone with manager Day upstairs as they deploy the incoming 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only one table left," Day reports to Sherwood at 12:25, contentedly surveying 
a field of well-heeled patrons in red banquettes flanked by photos of hundreds 
of notables who've dined and dealt at the Occidental Grill over the last nine 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Occidental, a survivor of battles as pitched as the political struggles 
that periodically change the occupant of the mansion next door, is one of a 
dozen Washington restaurants currently in favor among politicians, bureaucrats, 
lawyers and lobbyists who, even in the austere '90s, still gotta eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, relieved restaurateurs from Dupont Circle to Capitol Hill talk 
hopefully of the example set by the new commander-in-chief, who appears never 
to have met an entree he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big difference between Democrats and Republicans is that the Democrats 
eat out more," said Steven Damato, an owner of Nora's, a not-new but newly 
trendy restaurant near Dupont Circle that serves organic food. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton is all over town; these guys are all over town. Clinton and 
every Cabinet official have been here." 
</P>
<P>
 Damato also praised the Administration for being serious about reforming 
health care but not for the reason one might think. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every conceivable health group from nurses to gynecologists to drug companies 
has come to Washington to lobby," Damato said gratefully. "It's benefited the 
restaurant industry enormously." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Clinton, who came for dinner, Attorney General Janet Reno, Commerce 
Secretary Ron Brown and White House Chief of Staff Thomas "Mack" McLarty have 
eaten at the Occidental, a lunchtime haunt of high-powered lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Occidental is the one where the hidden business gets done," said Ben 
Giliberti, a Justice Department lawyer who doubles as wine critic for the 
Washington Post. "It's not as flashy as Duke Zeibert's and you'll see more 
cellular phones in the Occidental than anywhere else in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstructed in 1986 along with the adjacent Willard Hotel, the old 
Occidental was the scene of the ultimate power meal: In October, 1962, a KGB 
agent passed to then ABC State Department correspondent John Scali the Russian 
offer to withdraw nuclear missiles from Cuba, which eventually defused the 
worst superpower confrontation of the postwar era. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing so momentous has happened in the culinary world since, though a truce 
meal, albeit unsuccessful, was staged last year between Clinton and his 
Republican nemesis, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, at another 
Washington monument, Duke Zeibert's. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Occidental, a veteran of Washington's restaurant wars that lost its 
original home to a wrecker's ball, Duke's is chopped liver to the Occidental's 
charred tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 One of several establishments that sell ersatz New York Jewish comfort food to 
primarily middle-aged males, Duke's is home away from home to CNN talk-meister 
Larry King and the owner of the Redskins football team, Jack Kent Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I come here often? Oh heavens, no. Only five days a week," joked Cooke as 
he vacated Duke's premier booth about five yards into the cavernous dining room 
overlooking Connecticut Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuous at the restaurant entrance are glass cases housing three Super 
Bowl trophies won by the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm privileged to put them here with dear Duke," Cooke said. "He's truly an 
icon in this town -- a genuine one." 
</P>
<P>
 An octogenarian, like Cooke, Zeibert has passed management of the 45-year-old 
establishment to his son, Randy. To hear the patrons tell, however, nothing 
about the place has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They give a good fast lunch with meat and potatoes," said Tom Korologos, a 
premier lobbyist who says his client list includes the National Rifle Assn. and 
Anheuser Busch. 
</P>
<P>
 Korologos, who has done more than his share of power lunches since he arrived 
in Washington in 1962, asserted that the institution was on its way out and 
being replaced by the power breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days you had semi-unlimited expense accounts and the ethics rules 
and deductions rules were different," he reminisced. "Now you can't take some 
poor slob making $57,000 a year to the Watergate because that guy has to buy 
his own lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Korologos, whose salary is obviously somewhat larger, said he does his early 
morning networking with the likes of Washington Post top executive Katharine 
Graham and veteran deal-maker Bob Strauss at the Hay-Adams hotel, where orange 
juice and eggs can run $30. As for lunch, he said, "I buy more lunches in the 
slop shop in the Senate basement than I do at restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Capitol Hill eateries, not everyone shares Korologos's mid-day 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think the power lunch goes on," said Paul Zucconi, manager of La 
Colline, a classic French restaurant that has lasted a dozen years on Capitol 
Hill. "Of course, the consumption of alcohol is drastically off from what it 
used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days when a frolicsome Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and his old 
drinking buddy, Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), are said to have pulled their 
framed photos off the wall by the bar, thrown them down on the floor and danced 
on them -- a story Zucconi, in hallowed Washington tradition, refused to 
"confirm or deny." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Kennedy is a customer of ours along with his wife, Vicki," was all 
Zucconi would say on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
 On the secret of La Colline's success, he was modest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to think we are good because of our longevity in this town but would 
we be this busy if we were not located across the street from the Senate? I 
think not." 
</P>
<P>
 Location is key for the lunchtime crowd, who rarely stray far from their 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Noon to 12:30 is the main time for a reservation, and one hour and 15 minutes 
is the maximum they stay," said Larry King (not to be confused with the CNN 
host), the manager of 701 Pennsylvania, a sleekly modern 3-year-old restaurant 
that attracts patrons from the nearby Justice Department, Federal Trade and 
Securities and Exchange commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come from a meeting and are talking about business when they arrive, 
they continue their business during lunch and they're still talking about it 
when they're done," King said. "There are not too many pleasure lunches around 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the still powerful if scandal-tinged 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, reserves his famous appetite 
for lobbyists' attention and rare meat for the dinner hour at Morton's of 
Chicago, a steakhouse in Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton went to the lovely historic neighborhood to consume a mammoth 
Italian midday repast at Filomena's in January with German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, "nobody goes to Georgetown for lunch unless you work there," said an 
influential trade lawyer with a Los Angeles firm, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inconceivable that you would go as much as two miles for lunch," the 
lawyer said, "where in L.A. you would think nothing of going 20 miles." 
</P>
<P>
 Where downtown power lunch choices were once limited to Sans Souci (which 
closed in 1979), Maison Blanche, another French spot near the White House, and 
Duke's, a variety of cuisines have become available over the last decade as 
bureaucratic tastes have become more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bombay Club, next to Lafayette Park and Red Sage on 14th Street, attracts 
a fair slice of high-profile journalists and Administration officials (though a 
"depressing number" of the latter, including Clinton top adviser George 
Stephanopoulos, eat at their desks, according to Times White House 
correspondent David Lauter). 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawyers and lobbyists along the K Street corridor like the Italian 
restaurants Galileo, i Ricchi and Primi Piatti, as well as steakhouses such as 
Sam and Harry's and The Palm. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the International Monetary Fund go to Mr. K's, an expensive 
Chinese restaurant on K Street, when they're not dining at their in-house 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Taberna del Alabardero, an elegant Spanish restaurant in the same 
neighborhood, is also popular with the diplomatic corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Kennedy Administration is often credited with sparking the 
development of fine restaurants in Washington, the L.A. trade lawyer said it 
was really Richard Nixon's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those regulatory agencies, like the Environmental Protection Agency, got 
their start under Nixon and that's what brought the lobbyists," he said. 
"Before that, it was a wasteland." 
</P>
<P>
 Hot spots come and go: for the last two years, the southwestern-flavored Red 
Sage; before that, the Tuscan i Ricchi. 
</P>
<P>
 The key qualification, the lawyer said, is not so much the food as that the 
restaurant "treats you well so that if you call at 11:59 and need a table for 
noon you can get one." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he added, "the ultimate power restaurant is obviously the White 
House mess." 
</P>
<P>
 No reservations accepted there.

when she was 2.

ANN CONWAY: A TASTEFUL 'PERFORMANCE'; ARTS CENTER GUILDS COOK UP A SWEET 
FUND-RAISER WITH DESSERT-RICH RECIPE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was more than chicken and mushrooms with sherry orange sauce on the 
counter of Barbara Moreland's sunny Orange kitchen last week. 
</P>
<P>
 There were the page proofs of "Sterling Performances," the colorful 
fund-raising cookbook whipped up by the Guilds of the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, Moreland welcomed members of the cookbook committee -- Marlene 
Short, Jane Biel (editor), Carol Thompson, E.L. Smith and Jan Martens -- to her 
Mediterranean-style home for a luncheon of dishes created from recipes in the 
book. Up for tasting at a table set with gleaming china and a crystal bowl full 
of pink roses: the saucy chicken, Cajun baguettes, mandarin wild rice and field 
salad with toasted walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert? Sugar-dusted Chocolate Irish Cream cake (see accompanying recipe) -- 
perfect for your St. Patrick's Day celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 It took close to two years and $100,000 to create the 350-recipe book, but the 
committee is confident that the $19.95 volume will become a bestseller. Sale 
proceeds will help defray the arts center's operating costs. While available at 
bookstores, cookbooks ordered directly from the Costa Mesa center will result 
in higher proceeds, Short said. (To order, call (714) 556-2787, Ext. 558). 
</P>
<P>
 "The cookbook's emphasis is on fresh, interesting ingredients and 
uncomplicated recipes," said Thompson, the book's business chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Short: "Even if you buy the cookbook in Atlanta, you'll be able to find 
the ingredients there. But it will still have that Southern California flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 While the book is full of recipes for appetizers, main courses and salads, its 
emphasis is on desserts. "Our committee did some careful research -- checked 
cookbooks from around the country -- and, every time, desserts had the biggest 
representation," Short said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a torso-adoring country? "We know people are on diets," Biel said, "that 
they want to be healthy. We've decided people live vicariously by reading the 
dessert recipes!" 
</P>
<P>
 Not at Moreland's house. Served on dainty dessert plates, the St. Paddy's Day 
cake and the accompanying custard sauce disappeared faster than you could say 
"Paddy's pig." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Martens, who oversaw the dessert potion of the cookbook, baked the cake 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Did she sample the recipe's Irish cream or vodka? "No. I made it early this 
morning," she said, laughing. "But I loved the vapors." Chocolate Irish Cream 
Cake 
</P>
<P>
 1 18 1/4oz package yellow cake mix 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup Irish cream liqueur 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 10-inch bundt pan. In a mixing 
bowl, combine cake mix, pudding mix, oil, water, vodka, liqueur, and eggs. Beat 
until smooth. Pour batter into prepared bundt pan. Bake 40 to 50 minutes or 
until a wooden pick comes out clean. Invert cake to cool. Remove from pan. Dust 
with powdered sugar. Cake may be served plain or with Irish Custard Sauce. 
Garnish with strawberries.

volume and holds its shape in a spoon, about 6 minutes. Remove pan from water.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; ENTERTAINING IDEAS ABOUT HAVING FUN ON A 
BUDGET? DON'T DESPAIR. WITH A SENSE OF ADVENTURE, AND MAYBE A FEW BUCKS, 
THERE'S NO NEED TO BREAK THE BANK IN ORDER TO BREAK THE ROUTINE.; ON THE CHEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's there to do when you're low on bucks? Plenty, found three OC High 
correspondents who went scouting for interesting outings that didn't require a 
financial investment.  
</P>
<P>
 The correspondents -- Alison Koodrich, a senior at Ocean View High School in 
Huntington Beach; Michelle Pham, a junior at Trabuco Hills High School in 
Mission Viejo, and Amy Suarez, a senior at Troy High School in Fullerton -- 
each went their separate ways to find entertaining destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 They were looking for things to do for $10 or less -- and with only a couple 
of exceptions -- they came in on or under budget. Here are a few of the 
possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 * Side-By-Side 
</P>
<P>
 16091 Gothard St., at Edinger Avenue Huntington Beach (714) 847-8333  
</P>
<P>

figure skating, power skating, broom hockey, roller hockey and more. Admission 
to the roller rink is $4.50; skate rental is $2. Admission to the ice rink is 
$5.50, with a $2.50 charge for skate rental. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fountain Valley Family Fun Center 
</P>
<P>
 16800 Magnolia St. Fountain Valley (714) 842-1111 or (714) 842-1011

boats, go-carts, arcade and Bullwinkle's Family restaurant. Costs: miniature 
golf, $5; bumper boats, $3.25; go-carts, $3.75; batting cages, $1 for 18 
pitches.

roller-blades and cruise along the beach path for just $5 an hour, $13 a day.  
</P>
<P>
 * Huntington Central Park 
</P>
<P>
 On Goldenwest Street (between Slater and Talbert avenues) Huntington Beach 
Pack a picnic basket and take your friends for a relaxing day in the park. Go 
on a bike ride, take a walk through the nature center, play Frisbee golf or 
walk your dog around the lake. You can also grab a snack at Alice's Breakfast 
in the Park, 6622 Lakeview Drive, (714) 848-0690.

</P>

 or 
</P>
<P>
 End of Balboa Pier in Newport Beach (714) 675-7829 Take a walk down either 
pier and stop for a shake at Ruby's. Whether you sit inside or out, the only 
way to avoid the spectacular view is by closing your eyes. (You may want to sit 
inside because, quite simply, it can get really cold outside at the end of the 
pier.) And the burgers are a delight: Ruby's Burger is $3.89; the chili size 
burger is $5.64. For beach-lovers, park some distance away and roller skate or 
bike to the pier, which makes arriving seem even more worth it. Open for 
breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 7979 Center Ave. Huntington Beach (714) 892-4666

</P>
<P>
 * Corona del Mar Tide Pools 
</P>
<P>
 Take Pacific Coast Highway south through Corona del Mar, turn right on Poppy 
and keep going until it dead-ends at Ocean Boulevard. Park there and take the

which consists of eight slices and easily feeds two people, is $12.95. If you

she'd be shocked by the patrons or the lyrics of one of the bands. Hours: 7:30

 With more than 75 of Leo Fender's prototypes, amplifiers and instruments -- 
including the first guitar he ever made -- on display, the Fullerton Museum 
Center has a great exhibit on the late electric guitar pioneer. "Five Decades 
of Fender," which runs through April 2, is great for anyone who enjoys music. 
There is a viewing room where you can watch a tape of the elderly Fender talk 
about his work. TV screens throughout the museum, equipped with headphones, let 
you hear musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Elvis Costello play Fender guitars. 
In one corner there are four chairs, and next to each is a Fender guitar and an 
amplifier with headphones, where patrons can strum away and make their own 
music. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you think you might want to attend a different high school next fall, now 
is the time to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new state law, students can attend a school other than their 
neighborhood school. The open-enrollment policy stipulates that transfer 
students be selected on a random, or lottery-type, basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Most districts have put together brochures or flyers to explain the new 
policy. Deadlines for applications by prospective transfer students are rapidly 
approaching (and deadlines in some districts have passed). 
</P>
<P>
 Open-enrollment information and applications are available by calling your 
district office. Looking for a Cure 
</P>
<P>
 If you have some ideas about how to curb school violence, put those thoughts 
or slogans on paper; you might win a cash award for your effort. 
</P>
<P>
 A slogan and essay contest sponsored by the Americanism Educational League is 
open to all Orange County high school seniors, according to Stephen R. Knott, 
league president. Knott is a partner in Knott's Berry Farm, founded by his 
grandfather, who started the contest in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's 300-word essay topic is "School Violence: The Causes, the Cure." 
Essays by seven students will be published in a brochure that will be 
circulated nationally. First prize is $300. The three top slogan winners will 
receive $650, $450 and $300. Seventeen additional winners will receive from 
$250. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadline is April 22. Entry forms are available from high school English 
teachers or by calling the league office at (714) 522-7671. Speaking of 
Violence 
</P>
<P>
 The Shamrock, the student newspaper at Kennedy High School in La Palma, 
recently asked students if criminal executions should be televised. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the responses: "Yes, because the people . . . deserve punishment. I 
think it's right because it (will) prevent other people from making the same 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so, because little children (would be) able to see it and it 
would be a bad influence on them." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's not right because it provokes more violence." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's OK with the person getting executed, then sure, why not?"

TIPS ON SAFETY FOR HOME WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For people unaccustomed to doing their own home repairs, maintenance or 
remodeling, "The Reader's Digest Book of Skills and Tools" offers safety 
advice: 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure you have safety equipment -- such as goggles, earplugs and dust 
masks -- appropriate for the task. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't wear gloves when handling tools that require a firm grip.Do wear them 
when working with rough materials, sharp edges and broken glass and when 
cleaning up after a project. 
</P>
<P>
 * If a cutting tool stalls because of an impediment, switch off the power and 
unplug the tool before trying to remove the impediment. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you set up a ladder or scaffold in front of a door, lock or bar the door. 
</P>
<P>
 * When using a ladder, climb only as high as the third step from the top; 
never stand on the braces, extension arms or paint shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 * When soldering, remember that lead solder is toxic. The work area should be 
ventilated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always wear eye protection when working with metal to prevent injury from 
splinters; also wear heavy gloves and long sleeves to protect against sharp 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Install a fire extinguisher and smoke alarms in your work area. 
</P>
<P>
 * When working with tools, don't wear sandals, open-toe or canvas shoes, and 
avoid loose-fitting clothing, which could become entangled in a power tool and 
cause serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't leave tools, hardware or building materials lying around when not in 
use. They're an invitation to an accident, especially if you have children.

even amateurs are taking a look at problems such as loose tiles and cracked 
plaster and wondering if they can fix it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 A scouting trip to a bookstore could provide the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who habitually tackles home-remodeling projects -- according to the 
U.S. Census Bureau, that's almost half the home-owning population -- knows 
there is no scarcity of information. Before the Northridge earthquake, 
do-it-yourself was already a major theme for the belt-tightening '90s. The most 
popular program on PBS is "This Old House," and today's brides are registering 
for power tools along with china and silver. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge of home-repair books, magazines, videos and TV shows presents a 
mixed blessing for the novice remodeler. Choosing the right reference source 
has become almost as daunting as wandering the aisles at the local builders' 
supply store with its acres of tools and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading a parade of new home-repair books is "The Reader's Digest Book of 
Skills and Tools," a fat, colorful volume published last fall. It promises help 
for everyone from the novice who tightens screws with a butter knife to the 
artisan preparing to install parquet flooring. 
</P>
<P>
 The book joins a long list of Reader's Digest do-it-yourself titles, including 
"The Home Improvement Manual" and "The New, Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual." 
</P>
<P>
 The 360-page book has 2,000 illustrations, including 800 photographs of 800 
hand and power tools and accessories and 1,000 detailed drawings of techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "An empowering book," says Doug Dutton, owner of Dutton's Brentwood Books. 
"Going to a Home Depot is an overwhelming experience. You could take this book 
to the hardware store and point."  
</P>
<P>
 He thinks the tightened economy is only one reason for a booming interest in 
do-it-yourself books. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a time when we seem to have so little power over what's around us -- we 
don't even know what's under the hood of our car anymore -- this is one of the 
few areas where you can actually have a certain amount of control over what 
you're doing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skills and Tools" ($30) is one of four major new books offering an 
encyclopedic scope for home repairs and remodeling, he says. Others: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bob Vila's Toolbox," $25, William Morrow, 235 pages. The well-known home 
renovator ("This Old House" and "Bob Vila's Home Again") who is also the TV 
spokesman for Sears, Roebuck & Co., offers a comprehensive illustrated guide to 
hand and power tools.  
</P>
<P>
 * "The Stanley Complete Step-by-Step Book of Home Repair and Improvement," 
$25, Simon and Schuster, 470 pages. The emphasis is on projects, from 
installing alarm systems to masonry. Replete with color drawings of tools and 
equipment and a bonus of $75 worth of coupons from the Stanley Tool Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ortho's Home Improvement Encyclopedia, $24.95, Ortho, 511 pages. Heavy focus 
on photographs, with some line drawings, of specific interior and exterior 
projects such as building a patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Television and home videos also are popular with do-it-yourself consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two PBS staples are produced at Boston's WGBH TV. "This Old House," now in its 
10th year, focuses each season on the comprehensive renovation of one house. 
"New Yankee Workshop," which concentrates on woodworking projects, launched its 
sixth season in January with an emphasis on children's toys and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 For do-it-yourselfers, both shows produce a line of videos demonstrating 
specific projects.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; BUNGEE JUMP REQUIRES $10 AND A LEAP OF FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Amy Suarez, senior Troy High School 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, OK. I admit I didn't do it. But three of my friends did, and they had a 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
 What am I talking about? 
</P>
<P>
 Bungee jumping, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fiesta Village (just off Interstate 10 near Riverside) there is 
75-foot-high tower from which you can throw yourself an equivalent of 7 1/2 
stories in about two seconds. It will make "you feel like you're going to throw 
up," as one of my friends put it so eloquently.  
</P>
<P>
 What's more, it only costs $10 with a student ID. But you must be 18 or have a 
parent's written consent. 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds a bit risky, mellow out. Each bungee jump employee must take a 
two-week training course, so they say they know what they're doing when they 
fit you into that upper and lower harness. And there is a 10-by-20-foot air 
mattress under the platform. As far as the rumors of sharp jolts? Each of my 
friends can attest to a smooth jump all the way to the end of the cord. Two of 
them even forked out another $10 each to jump "one more time." 
</P>
<P>
 Still not impressed? The village also offers an 18-hole miniature golf course 
that costs $4.95 ($2 for replays), race cars, batting cages, an arcade and game 
room, food and refreshments. A water slide is open from June to September. The 
brochure boasts that Fiesta Village provides "thrilling adventure and plenty of 
fun for families, groups and special parties."  
</P>
<P>
 Or, of course, for just you and a couple of your friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiesta Village is at 1405 E. Washington St., Colton. Hours are 9 a.m. to 10 
p.m. Sunday through Thursday; 9 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday. (909)

HARD TIMES FOR HARD ROCK? NOT SO SAYS KEY SALES CHART; POP MUSIC: NEW ALBUMS BY 
SOUNDGARDEN AND NINE INCH NAILS WILL ENTER BILLBOARD MAGAZINE'S CHART IN THE 
TOP TWO SPOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just three years after hard rock's commercial vitality was in doubt, the 
first-week sales splash of Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails adds dramatically to 
the mounting evidence that the aggressive musical genre is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 Soundgarden's "Superunknown" album sold an estimated 163,000 copies last week 
to enter the national pop chart at No. 1, while Nine Inch Nails' "The Downward 
Spiral" sold an estimated 119,000 to enter at No. 2 when Billboard magazine 
hits the newsstands Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the highest 1994 first week sales showing since the holiday shopping 
spree ended in January with No. 1 and No. 2 albums by Mariah Carey and Pearl 
Jam generating similar sales tallies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who tells you that rock 'n' roll is dead is completely out of touch 
with what's going on in the music industry," said Mike Fine, chief executive 
officer of SoundScan, the New York research firm that monitors sales data for 
the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, no one ever saw an underground rock act burst on the 
mainstream pop chart the way they do now. But ever since Nirvana crossed over, 
the commercial potential of alternative rock is taken seriously by the people 
who run the music business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's particularly encouraging to the industry is that Soundgarden and Nine 
Inch Nails now appear to add to an already impressive list of young 
best-selling bands, including Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Smashing 
Pumpkins and Soul Asylum. Both the new Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails albums 
are expected to continue to sell strongly through the spring and summer as the 
bands tour across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock is definitely going through a big resurgence right now," said Al Cafaro, 
president and CEO of A&M Records Inc., the label that releases Soundgarden's 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a flurry of brilliant artists out there like Soundgarden and Nine 
Inch Nails, each exploring their own creative vision. These aren't musicians 
who manufacture contrived products to appeal to the pop marketplace. The reason 
they're so successful is that they make inspired, high quality music." 
</P>
<P>
 While surveys suggest that the number of rock fans purchasing music has 
declined since 1989 from 43% to 33% of the $10-billion domestic market, 
rock-oriented consumers still purchase twice as many albums as country fans and 
four times the amount bought by rap fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock music accounted for more than $3 billion in domestic sales last year with 
many of the nation's biggest hits being delivered by new acts. Pearl Jam -- 
which broke the record for the biggest selling debut in October with its 
950,000-selling "Vs." -- sold more records in the United States last year than 
any other artist, generating an estimated $72 million from sales of its two 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of alternative acts from Pearl Jam to Nine Inch Nails coincides 
precisely with the rise of Generation X, whose alienation is captured 
succinctly in a new rebellious music that helps differentiate young fans from 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the industry also credit alternative rock's sudden high visibility to 
SoundScan. In many cases under Billboard's old system, store personnel 
frequently failed to report the sales of budding bands with whose music they 
were unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative rock artists fare much better under SoundScan because figures are 
entered into a computer every time a clerk runs an album through a bar code 
scanner at the sales register. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts speculate that this week's showing for Soundgarden and Nine Inch 
Nails will encourage record executives to gamble on signing more unconventional 
young artists -- laying a foundation for an even broader resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 Record companies have already begun to invest more money to develop new acts, 
giving "baby" bands more time and bigger budgets to build a fan base and hone 
their chops on the concert circuit. Such efforts have paid off handsomely in 
grooming acts like Spin Doctors, Blind Melon, Counting Crows, PJ Harvey, Liz 
Phair and the Afghan Whigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 13-year-old to 21-year-old customer is a huge chunk of our business and 
they're buying tons of music by a brand-new crop of original rock artists," 
said Mike Murray, vice president and general manager of the Ft. 
Lauderdale-based, 520-outlet Blockbuster Music. "There used to be only a couple 
sure-bet heavy-hitting superstars out there who dominated the rock industry, 
but that's just not the case anymore."

L.A. STATIONS UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS SCRUTINY; TELEVISION: COMPLAINTS BY COMMUNITY 
LEADERS AND AN L.A. CITY COUNCILMAN TRIGGER AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE HIRING 
AND TREATMENT OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN IN THE NEWSROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sparked by complaints of racism and sexism at KCBS-TV Channel 2 and KNBC-TV 
Channel 4, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said Wednesday that it will 
initiate an investigation into the hiring and treatment of minorities and women 
in newsrooms at all seven major local commercial TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Montez, western regional director of the commission, said the probe was 
largely prompted by a formal complaint filed Tuesday by Los Angeles City 
Councilman Richard Alatorre, in which he alleged that there was a "systematic 
effort to deny equal treatment to Latinos, other ethnic minorities, women and 
the gay community employed in the broadcasting industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre singled out CBS-owned Channel 2 in his complaint, saying that he had 
"received information on KCBS that describes working conditions that are 
unacceptable." Although he declined to give specific information about what he 
had been told by employees, saying that he wanted to protect the 
confidentiality of those still working at KCBS, Alatorre wrote, "Latinos and 
other minorities should not be subjugated to constant harassment and 
intimidation, demotions and indiscriminate and disproportionate firings and/or 
terminations." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Los Angeles Urban League, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation/L.A., and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also said they have 
heard numerous complaints over the past several weeks from employees at KCBS 
regarding what were described as insensitive racial comments by management, 
favored treatment of white male reporters, lack of promotion for minorities and 
negative coverage of ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of the organizations are planning to request or already have asked for 
meetings or reports from station management about the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS General Manager William Applegate on Wednesday denied the accusations by 
Alatorre and others, saying the charges were news to him: "Alatorre has not 
spoken to me. Nobody has come to my office to complain." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "KCBS has an excellent record of hiring minorities, and to the best 
of my knowledge, no minority has been demoted or harassed. The station is going 
through changes, but there is no policy to single out minorities for demotions. 
Anybody who says that is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy regarding KCBS comes little more than a month after KNBC-TV 
was hit with charges by Latino journalists who said that discrimination by 
management played a key role in the departure of five Latino reporters and 
anchors in less than five months. KNBC executives denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to KCBS and KNBC, the Civil Rights Commission's investigation will 
cover KTLA-TV Channel 5, KABC-TV Channel 7, KCAL-TV Channel 9, KTTV-TV Channel 
11 and KCOP-TV Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we'll find in this investigation," Montez said, "but there 
is a lot in the air. The best thing to do at this point is to look at all the 
channels. We may even look at the Federal Communications Commission to see if 
they are properly monitoring the practices at all these stations." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was also concerned about what he called "negative" coverage of 
minority communities by the stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Montez said he hoped to reach some conclusions about the extent of the 
investigation in six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban League President John Mack said he already had planned to meet with KCBS 
chief Applegate on Friday to discuss "disturbing complaints" he has heard from 
newsroom employees about the treatment of African Americans. He said he was 
particularly concerned about the fate of weekend anchor Hosea Sanders, whom he 
said has been told that his contract will not be renewed when it expires this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources in the KCBS newsroom said that when Sanders was hired as a weekend 
anchor in 1986, he and community groups were told by management that he was the 
most likely candidate to become the first black male weekday anchor at the 
station. He has never been promoted beyond the weekend shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our opinion, it is very troubling that they are not renewing Sanders' 
contract," Mack said. "He is an excellent reporter who cares about our 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders and Applegate declined to comment about his status. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups said they had received their own complaints about KCBS. Lee 
Werbel, executive director of Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation/L.A., 
on Wednesday sent a letter to the station requesting a meeting to talk about 
allegations of discrimination against gay employees. Esther Renteria, head of 
the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said she has requested a written report 
from Applegate to determine whether KCBS has lived up to an agreement it made 
with her organization years ago to have at least one Latino as a finalist when 
there is a job opening at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one newsroom employee, who asked not to be named, "It's like the 
management has its own agenda to whiten up the newsroom -- to make it whiter 
and maler. There is little sensitivity to minority concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Another staffer said KCBS editors consistently talked against reporting 
positive stories about ethnic communities, and said many minorities were being 
bombarded with streams of negative memos criticizing their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy closely echoes the recent furor at KNBC-TV that became public 
in February when Latino journalists charged that discrimination by management 
had played a significant part in the exit of five Latino reporters and anchors 
in the preceding five months. Current and former staffers contended that Latino 
journalists had been consistently pushed into the background by news director 
Mark Hoffman while white male reporters received preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC management denied the accusations. General Manager Reed Manville abruptly 
resigned last Friday, and although NBC Television Stations President John 
Rohrbeck said that the departure was not connected to the charges of 
discrimination, he noted that there was a "perceived" problem among the 
newsroom staff of low morale and other troubles that required "a change in 
leadership." And he announced that the station would be hiring an executive to 
oversee the hiring and promotion of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Latinos who left KNBC late last year, Linda Alvarez, was hired at 
KCBS as a morning anchor.

POP BEAT: HOLIDAY SPIRIT; INSPIRED BY THE JAZZ LEGEND, ETTA JAMES CRAFTS A 
REVEALING COLLECTION OF LADY DAY'S MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the notes to her new album, "Mystery Lady," subtitled "Songs of Billie 
Holiday," Etta James explains how, as a child, she would watch her mother, 
Dorothy, only 14 years her elder, prepare to go out for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Billie Holiday would be singing 'Fine and Mellow' on the scratchy phonograph 
as Dorothy painted her full lips with fire-red lipstick, powdered her face, 
snapped on huge hoop earrings, slipped into an elegant black dress and splashed 
on her midnight cologne. I can still smell it, still see her." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by these memories, James, now 56, has crafted a collection of 
Holiday's music that reveals much about the three women. As she says elsewhere 
in the notes, "The mystery lady is my mother. The mystery lady is also Billie 
Holiday, who in so many ways reminds me of my mother. And I suppose the mystery 
lady is me." 
</P>
<P>
 James is best known for her decidedly risque R&B presentations since her 1955 
hit "The Wallflower" (given that title when the record company felt that the 
song's original name, "Roll With Me Henry," was just too suggestive). But her 
latest album shows her off as a serious ballad singer while providing a glimpse 
of the influences that guided her course as a vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone from her home in Riverside, James explains the effect Holiday's 
music had on that preteen girl growing up in Los Angeles and what it means to 
her today. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, we could only listen to what she was talking about and say, 
'Yeah, right.' It was like somebody saying, 'Yeah, I hear you, but I don't know 
what you're saying.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But now as a grown-up, from firsthand experience, we know exactly what Billie 
was singing about, what she felt, why her songs are so sad, so melancholy, why 
there's so much hurt in them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about that song 'Don't Explain,' when she talks about lipstick on his 
collar" -- here she breaks into song -- " 'People will talk and you'll cheat, 
but that don't matter, dear, when you're with me.' When I was young, I thought, 
'Are you kidding? Don't explain? Boy, she's open-minded.' But now I understand. 
I've walked in her moccasins." 
</P>
<P>
 The path that James has followed to this point hasn't always been straight and 
narrow. But her perseverance, from her teen-singer days in a trio known as the 
Peaches ("we were black, we were women, we were winning all the talent contests 
in town, but that wasn't making us any money") and her discovery by Johnny Otis 
to some two dozen crossover hits in the '60s and her battles with poverty and 
drug addiction, has finally had its rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 Her popularity soared again in the mid-'80s with the releases of "The Early 
Show" and "The Late Show" (now available on CD as "Blues in the Night," Vols. 1 
and 2) with the late saxophonist Eddie (Cleanhead) Vinson. A new audience 
discovered her work, and she became the darling of young jazz-R&B fans, touring 
the world and recording new albums. 
</P>
<P>
 The last couple years have been particularly rewarding ones for James. She was 
inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame last year. MCA has released "The 
Essential Etta James," a collection of her Chess-label recordings of the '60s 
and '70s, joining "R&B Dynamite" (Ace), a compilation that chronicles her 
earlier work, including "Wallflower." 
</P>
<P>
 Etta James is big, again. 
</P>
<P>
 While the notes to "Mystery Lady" explain James' motivation to do Holiday, 
they shed little light on that other aspect of her career: the raunchy, 
good-naturedly sexy way she handles most of her material. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean the vulgar part?" she asked. "The vulgar part is my way of being 
defiant. It's being a woman and having to make my way through life and dealing 
with a man's world. I'm just singing a song, and this is the way I feel. If you 
don't like it, you might as well go back into a closet with yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new album, minus the rollicking, bawdy numbers on which she's staked 
her career, is a bit of a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be some controversy with this album," she said, "because 
it's more jazz. But I don't care what anybody else says." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She's doing a handful of numbers from the record on her current tour, which 
stops at the Coach House tonight and Friday at the Strand in Redondo Beach. 
She'll be accompanied by her regular Roots Band, rather than the all-star jazz 
lineup from the "Mystery Lady" album, which includes pianist-arranger Cedar 
Walton and saxophonist Red Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong personality herself, James admires her strong predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have always had to express themselves in a different way," she said. 
"Back in the days of Bessie Smith, if a woman went into a bar, she was 
considered a floozy. If she cocked her dress over one knee and said something 
smart, people said, 'How dare she?' Well, those were the strong women, the 
women making statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bessie Smith was a woman who really made statements. She once sang her way 
out of jail, and she wasn't afraid to sit in the middle of the floor and eat a 
pig's foot and drink a beer. I'm a modern-day Bessie Smith, people say, because 
I'm outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 James said she'd like one of her future albums to reflect her admiration of 
strong women musicians: "I'd like to do a collage, do all the favorite ladies 
of my life: Billie, Dinah Washington, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey. I love all those 
women." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that such an album would cast a wide net over jazz, blues and pop 
doesn't bother her. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these women were blood sisters," she said. "All of this music is from 
blood brothers. It doesn't matter if it's John Lee Hooker blues coming from 
Mississippi or some jazz cat saying, 'Let's take this thing uptown and be 
cool.' Johnny Otis always said that Lightnin' Hopkins and Miles Davis weren't 
first cousins. They were blood brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Categories have always been a problem for James, as she says in the notes to 
"Mystery Lady": "I felt I belonged in all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one category she still has yet to pursue: country music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved country," she said. "I love Randy Travis and the Judds and 
George Jones and those people. And I've always wondered why there were no black 
singers in country, except for Charley Pride, and no women at all. I always 
wanted to be one of the first black women to go to the Grand Ole Opry." 
</P>
<P>
 "Country music -- all it is is the blues. And it tells some of the best 
stories, some of that same Billie Holiday type of stuff. You sit there, you're 
going to hear a story. None of this 'C'mon, baby, fly me to the moon, we're 
going to swing among the stars.' It's let's-get-down stuff. Everything they 
talk about is real. If they say their hog has cholera, I can understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 James is telling her story as well, to biographer David Ritz, who wrote the 
liner notes for "Mystery Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's sort of like a little therapist for me," James said. "I'm remembering 
all these things." 
</P>
<P>
 But James prefers that whatever else her life holds in store remain a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been the type to say, 'Where am I going next?' or 'Will I win this 
Grammy or that?' Even when we were first starting out, I never thought what I'd 
be doing 50 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me what was it like in the fabulous '50s -- did you realize all 
the great things that were happening then? We didn't think anything about it at 
the time. It was just like fixing a plain old pot of greens and some corn 
bread. We didn't blow it out of proportion." 
</P>

WORKS ART GALLERY TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 5-year-old Works art gallery in the Crystal Court shopping mall will be 
closed by the start of next month, largely because of waning sales, gallery 
director Richard Iri said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, sales have dropped about 40%, Iri said, attributing 
the decline to general economic doldrums and not to the level in Orange County 
of art collectors' sophistication."I think the collectors down here are more 
sophisticated than they're given credit for," he said, "and certainly are 
hungry for seeing both new and established artists." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no plans to reopen the gallery elsewhere in the county, Iri said. 
Owner Mark Moore, who owns a Works Gallery in Santa Monica, has refused to 
discuss the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 An exhibit of work by graduate students from Southern California was to have 
opened in the Costa Mesa gallery next week. "Maybe a mall wasn't the best place 
for the show anyway," said April Ford, one of 17 students to have participated 
in the show. "But I'm sure it would have been good to have (the Works Gallery) 
down there" in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery has shown such well-known artists as Kim Abeles, Jay McCafferty, 
Jim Morphesis, Eric Orr, Larry Bell, Tony DeLap and Lita Albuquerque.

WARHOL PRESS CONFERENCE TURNS INTO A BIG EVENT; ART: THE PITTSBURGH MUSEUM, TO 
OPEN MAY 16, IS CALLED THE LARGEST SHOWCASE FOR A SINGLE ARTIST IN AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMEI WALLACH, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For sure, Andy Warhol, who invented Fame, as we know it, presided over 
Tuesday's press conference to announce the May 16 opening of the Andy Warhol 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum will open in Warhol's hometown of Pittsburgh; the press conference 
took place at Mr. Chow, a midtown Manhattan restaurant with a sufficient 
modicum of art-world chic to lure not just press but enough art world 
luminaries to produce the kind of sizzle that produces coverage, that produces 
crowds, that means hot . 
</P>
<P>
 The tawdry, backbiting, big-money, big-art court trials and scandals that have 
beset the Andy Warhol Foundation for months were firmly shoved out of the 
limelight, as Picasso biographer John Richardson announced "the largest museum 
to a single artist in America, and perhaps the world. It is," he noted, "larger 
than the Musee Picasso" in Paris. Richardson, who took the occasion to remind 
the audience that he gave Warhol's eulogy in St. Patrick's Cathedral after the 
artist died after a gallbladder operation on Feb. 22, 1987, said that the 
museum "should not be seen as a mausoleum but as a place where Andy's protean 
work will continue to exercise its magic." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Armstrong, former director of New York's Whitney Museum of American Art 
and now director of the Andy Warhol Museum, hailed Warhol as "an artist who 
changed our concept about the nature of art." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum will be born with 3,000 of Warhol's works, 500 of which will be on 
display on separate floors for the opening, which, Armstrong, said, will be 
inaugurated with "three days of raucous revelry," including a tour of the 
Pittsburgh sites of Andy's life, fireworks at midnight and a 24-hour museum 
open house. 
</P>
<P>
 It is located at 117 Sandusky St. in Pittsburgh, in a 73,000-square-foot 
warehouse built in 1911 and renovated at a cost of $12.3 million by Richard 
Gluckman Architects of New York. To fit both Andy's fecundity and his rat-pack 
instincts ("Only the FBI kept more comprehensive records than Andy," said 
Richardson), it was necessary to build an Archives Study Center, a film theater 
and a coffee shop, complete with cowhide banquette to complement Andy's 
signature cow wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Central as Andy's position is in the rethinking of what is art and what is 
culture in the late 20th Century (and what, for that matter, is 15 minutes of 
fame), the real reason for the size of the museum, and for the hoopla, is that 
it is the joint effort of three powerful art world institutions. The museum 
belongs to the Carnegie Institute, and is a collaboration between the Carnegie, 
Dia Center for the Arts and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Dia is the prime outpost of the avant-garde in New York these days. The 
Foundation is at the heart of the legal tangle, with director Archibald Gillies 
pitted against longtime Warhol manager Fred Hughes, and Hughes, in turn, in 
legal battles with his lawyer, Ed Hayes. Everyone at the press conference made 
a point of praising both Gillies and Hughes, no sides taken there. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnes Gund, chairman of the Museum of Modern Art, said quietly that some 
people think Andy is enjoying all the trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 And then everyone went home with a door prize in a silver bag: a Campbell's 
Soup Piggy Bank.

SOTHEBY'S VENTURES WEST ONCE AGAIN; ART: TWELVE YEARS AGO THE AUCTION HOUSE 
CLOSED ITS L.A. SALESROOM AND RETRENCHED IN NEW YORK, BUT NOW THE COMPANY 
RETURNS WITH 'SOME REAL CLASSICS' ON WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Armed with Andy Warhol's portrayal of Marilyn Monroe on its catalogue cover 
and a round of promotional events targeting potential clients, Sotheby's is 
making a Southern California comeback. Twelve years ago the auction house 
closed its Los Angeles salesroom and retrenched in New York, but now Sotheby's 
has returned with a sale of modern and contemporary prints. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, scheduled for Wednesday at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, is 
expected to launch an ongoing program of local print sales, to be held each 
March and October. A free public exhibition of selections from the inaugural 
sale will be held Friday through Tuesday at Sotheby's Beverly Hills office. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction offers 377 print portfolios and individual pieces, ranging from a 
pair of etchings by Mario Avati, valued at $400 to $500, to Henri de 
Toulouse-Lautrec's 1893 lithograph of Parisian dancer Jane Avril, which 
Sotheby's expects to sell for $30,000 to $40,000. There are works by modernist 
giants Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro, American artists Mary Cassatt and Edward 
Hopper, Mexican muralists Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros, and a 
predominantly American slate of contemporary artists including Sam Francis, 
Vija Celmins and John Baldessari. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some real classics and rare works in the sale, but I thought it was 
very important for most pieces to be in a reasonable price range," said 
Sotheby's print specialist Robert E. Monk, who organized the auction. "We want 
to encourage participation, especially from a younger audience." Nearly 90% of 
the items are estimated at under $5,000 -- many of them in the $1,000 to $2,000 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 All the works come from collections in California or other western states, 
Monk said. "This is not a New York-dictated sale or an auction that's been 
trucked in from New York. This is a real L.A. sale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction will be a two-part affair, with modern prints offered in the 
afternoon and contemporary material in the evening. Highlights among 19th- and 
early 20th-Century works include Georges Braque's 1907-8 "Etude de Nu" ($25,000 
to $35,000), which is the artist's first print; "Eight Bells," a rare etching 
on parchment by Winslow Homer ($26,000 to $30,000); and Henri Matisse's "Grand 
Liseuse," a 1923 lithograph of a woman reading ($20,000 to $25,000). 
</P>
<P>
 The contemporary line-up features Jasper Johns' 1989 drypoint and aquatint, 
"The Seasons" ($18,000 to $22,000), and Ed Ruscha's classic 1969 lithograph, 
"Hollywood With Observatory" ($8,000 to $10,000). The catalogue cover piece, 
Warhol's 1967 silk-screen of Marilyn Monroe, is expected to bring $9,000 to 
$11,000. 
</P>

BACKSTAGE RAPPING AT SOUL TRAIN AWARDS; POP MUSIC: WHITNEY HOUSTON AND TONI 
BRAXTON TAKE HOME HONORS IN A SHOW BLASTED FOR OVERLOOKING DR. DRE AND 
RECOGNIZING KENNY G. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitney Houston and Toni Braxton continued their winning award-show ways 
Tuesday night during the eighth annual Soul Train Awards ceremony at the Shrine 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was controversial rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg who caused the most stir with 
the press backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach rapper was angry that Dr. Dre's best-selling album "The 
Chronic" (which features his raps) and his own "Doggystyle" collection weren't 
nominated for best rap album. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know and I know that Dr. Dre had the best rap album of 1993," he declared 
to the media shortly after he and Dre finished performing on the show. "Why 
wasn't he even a nominee? How can they explain that? We feel we were done wrong 
on these awards." 
</P>
<P>
 While rap aficionados can't quarrel with any of the nominees -- Arrested 
Development, Naughty by Nature, Digable Planets and Onyx, the winner -- 
omitting Dr. Dre and Snoop seemed a glaring flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Not content to criticize the Soul Train competition, Snoop also took fire at 
the Grammys. Though Dre won an award for best rap solo performance in that 
ceremony, there was considerable unhappiness in the rap community that Dre's 
work was ignored in the more prestigious best album and best single categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a question about that awards show, he said, "(Expletive) the 
Grammys, they ain't right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another artist who rapped the Grammys Tuesday was a surprise: Whitney Houston, 
who won the best album and best record awards, criticized the Grammys for being 
out of touch with real music fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (the Soul Train Awards) is a more relaxed atmosphere. . . . it's a lot 
more flattering here with people you actually hear on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 This night, Houston didn't wear out a path between her seat in the auditorium 
and the podium collecting awards. Aside from the prearranged Sammy Davis Jr. 
Award as entertainer of the year, she won only for song of the year, "I Will 
Always Love You." 
</P>
<P>
 In the female single category, Houston's "I Have Nothing" lost to Toni 
Braxton's "Breathe Again." Braxton was also honored for best album by a female 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually there are no real quibbles about the winners of the Soul Train Awards, 
which are based on a survey of 3,000 radio programmers and record retailers. 
They often go to deserving black artists who are ignored by the Grammys. But 
there was grousing backstage by both artists and media about Kenny G's 
"Breathless" victory in the jazz album category. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the awards shows, you'd think this one would ignore lightweight 
pop-jazz. But the saxophonist's 5 million-selling album beat out George Benson, 
Fourplay and the favorite, Terence Blanchard and his score for "Malcolm X." 
</P>
<P>
 Commented an outraged artist who asked not to be identified, "What's this show 
coming to? It used to be hip. You can't give an award to Kenny G and be hip." 
</P>
<P>
 Babyface, who won best male album "(For the Cool in You"), also co-wrote and 
co-produced two other winners: "Toni Braxton" and Tevin Campbell's best male 
single, "Can We Talk." Janet Jackson's award for her music video "If" was her 
eighth overall, adding to her career-leading total.

KENT, NBC AGREE ON OUT-OF-COURT DEAL; TELEVISION: THE PERSIAN GULF WAR'S 'SCUD 
STUD' GETS A SETTLEMENT AND WRITTEN ADMISSION THAT HE WAS NOT FIRED FOR 
REFUSING A DANGEROUS ASSIGNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former NBC News correspondent Arthur Kent, who filed suit against the network 
after he was fired in 1992 for allegedly refusing an assignment to cover a war 
zone, said Wednesday he had agreed to an out-of-court settlement that provides 
him money and something he considered more important: his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC released a statement acknowledging that Kent had not been released because 
he refused to travel to the former Yugoslavia, as executives had maintained at 
the time.  
</P>
<P>
 When he was dismissed in August, 1992, officials under then-NBC News President 
Michael Gartner had said that Kent had turned down an assignment in war-torn 
Zagreb, Croatia, and was unable to work with others or take direction from 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent, who gained fame as an NBC correspondent during the Persian Gulf War 
(earning the nickname "Scud Stud"), maintained that he was asked to go to 
Zagreb without proper planning or safety precautions, and that he was being 
punished because of a contract dispute and his desire to do harder-edged 
stories for the newsmagazine "Dateline NBC." He filed a $25-million lawsuit in 
October, 1992, accusing the network of breach of contract, defamation and 
fraud. It was due to come to trial in Los Angeles next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of Wednesday's settlement were not disclosed. But in a statement, NBC 
News said that the events that led to his firing "were exclusively the result 
of a contract dispute between the parties. . . . They were not because of Mr. 
Kent's refusal to travel to and report from the former Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
 In a press conference to announce the settlement, Andrew Lack, president of 
NBC News, praised Kent's work and said that he hoped to have him return in some 
capacity.  
</P>
<P>
 "I did not bring this lawsuit to embarrass NBC News or to profit monetarily 
but to correct an injustice," Kent said. "What I was after was to set the 
record straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent, who said previously that NBC's statements about him had hurt his ability 
to get work at other networks, is currently the host of "Man Alive," a 
documentary series on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in his native Canada. 
Kent said that he planned to continue on the Canadian program but hoped that he 
might also work for NBC.
