VALLEY CHRONICLE: THESE GIRLS DO NOT PLAY GAMES CHOOSING ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES

 A different kind of feminism is alive and well in Lake View Terrace where a 
group of 22 young women have a collective mind of their own. When offered the 
opportunity to participate in co-ed basketball at the recreation center, they 
slam-dunked that idea faster than a speeding Laker. 
</P>
<P>
 These young women didn't want to clomp up and down the court getting hot and 
sweaty. The wanted to dance. They wanted to lead cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't get the wrong idea. According to program coordinator Sandy Sayers, 
they are righteous athletes. "There's a lot of athleticism out there and many 
of the girls play volleyball, soccer and other sports," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sayers talked over the situation with her boss, Gary Bond, last summer, and 
they decided to give the girls something to cheer about. They organized a 
cheerleading club to match, in age, the basketball players, with one group ages 
6 to 8, another ages 9 to 10, and a third ages 11 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 To lead the three groups they found a willing teacher in 15-year-old Granada 
Hills High School student Kiki Jacobs. Practice started in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls first cheered for an audience Jan. 15 and will continue every 
Saturday through the spring at the Lake View Terrace Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work once a week with each of the three groups and all day Saturday when 
they are cheering for the basketball teams," says Jacobs, who admits that she 
feels like the second mother of 22 girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little ones don't have a long attention span, but they are fun to work 
with because they love what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs says, "I learned cheerleading as a member of the Golden Bears 
cheerleading club that used to meet in Sylmar, and I also get some routines 
from the cheerleaders at Granada Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs says that in addition to teaching routines and trying to keep 
everyone's attention, she bakes cupcakes for her young charges and is planning 
a sleep-over. Just Thought We'd Check What Condition Their Condition Is In 
</P>
<P>
 Disasters can make you want to reach out and touch everybody. The Valley 
Chronicle decided to check up on how some of the people who have been in the 
column fared when the shake, rattle and rolling went down. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Bundy in Palmdale admits to extreme anxiety over the quake because her 
husband, Doug, was home from the hospital on a weekend leave. She says all she 
could think of was "he lived through a shooting that almost killed him. Please 
don't let him die now." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Bundy had fought for his life after being shot while working in a manhole 
for the phone company. His assailant has not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Bundy was not expected to live. Within days he was up and walking. 
His speech and coordination returned, but he's suffered some memory loss and 
sight in his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine surgeries, he still faces at least three more. But he's doing fine, 
says wife Chris, who says the list of people and organizations who have helped 
the family continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Furie, the Tarzana beauty salon owner who gave a party in November for 300 
of his present and former employees, sat in his shop at 6 o'clock the morning 
of the quake and cried at the sight around him. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Michael Joseph Furie salon at the corner of Wilbur Avenue and Ventura 
Boulevard, he says "the windows were blown out, the stations were pulled out of 
the walls, and all our supplies were under about two feet of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
 He had started the day calming his wife and going to help his cousin. "He 
lives at the corner of Woodman and Ventura. His apartment building had 
collapsed and he couldn't get out," Furie says. 
</P>
<P>
 After extracting his cousin, and taking him to the hospital, he went to the 
shop. His despair didn't last long. "I have 15 employees who depend upon me," 
says Furie, who adds that within 15 minutes the troops started showing up to 
help with the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in our center helped everyone else," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Teri and Gene Pira home in Northridge an exterior wall fell and killed 
the family's German shepherd, "but the rest of us are OK," says Teri Pira. 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Lena, had recently lost, and then found, her pet iguana, Iggy. 
</P>
<P>
 The family youngsters, two iguanas, bird and other dog are all doing just 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Out at the Montie Montana ranch in Agua Dulce everything is fine, but 
Montana's wife, Marilee, says the horses were somewhat unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all came flying out of their barn into the pens attached to their 
individual stalls and stood looking at each other trying to figure out who was 
kicking up all the fuss," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Sykes and Dave Golonski had recently adopted a Russian toddler. The 
couple, including their two children and 3-year-old John Vasily, are doing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the quake hit all we could hear was glass breaking around us. We got the 
kids and headed outside until it was light and we could see what was going on," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 John Vasily, who slept through the quake until his mother came to get him, is 
learning English at breakneck speed, but then, that's the way he does 
everything, according to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "To keep him out of harm's way after the quake, we put him in a car with a lot 
of other neighborhood children. He thought it was great fun. The kids all had a 
ball," Sykes says. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard and Bracha Loren of Woodland Hills knew their son, Yoeli Barag, would 
be anxious about them. Barag had been serving as a congressional page in 
Washington, D. C. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally found out that his folks were safe from some friends in Israel who 
had somehow gotten through to the Lorens when the phones seemed to be down and 
nobody else could. 
</P>
<P>
 Bracha, who works at the Encino office where her husband conducts his 
psychiatric practice, says it's been a busy couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to reassure people, and make them laugh, by telling them not to worry 
about the Big One coming until the seismologists at Cal Tech leave town," 
Bracha says. 
</P>
<P>
 She says that in spite of all the things that fell down and out at her home 
she still finds things to laugh at, including the transformation of jelly 
glasses to pricey crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fascinated by how many people who had glass break were harboring 24-piece 
sets of Waterford and Lalique," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the Fallbrook Retirement Center in Canoga Park, 88-year-old Connie 
Feldman can't be bothered talking about earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 She's too busy wondering where her fame has gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman was selected in October to be in a Little Caesars television 
commercial. But since that aired, her phone hasn't rang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought after I did that commercial, others would follow," says Feldman. 
"If anyone knows about a good agent, tell him to call me," she adds. Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any trouble anymore getting Sean to wear his bicycle helmet. In 
fact, since the earthquake he wears it everywhere, including to bed." Mother 
talking about her 9-year-old to friend near Serrania Park in Woodland Hills

JACK SMITH: THE PROSE OF ONE WHO STOPPED AND SMELLED THE ROSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 13 years (1958-71), Nick B. Williams was editor of The Times, dealing with 
war, natural disaster and human cussedness -- the stuff of news. Under his 
hand, The Times grew from a provincial right-wing sheet to one of the world's 
acknowledged great newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 All this time, though, Nick was suppressing, or perhaps nurturing, his natural 
urge to write about flowers, cats, birds, women and the mystery of life. When 
he retired, he began to pour out a stream of essays on those subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his family has collected these exuberant pieces, written for The Times 
editorial pages, in "Reflections on a Mockingbird" (M & M Printing, Pomona.) 
</P>
<P>
 I guarantee this book will make you feel more alive. 
</P>
<P>
 I worked for Nick Williams all the time he was editor. I loved him. He was 
decisive. He was smart. He was old-fashioned, in an endearing way. He was 
generous. His humor mellowed and sustained us. 
</P>
<P>
 One day I received a letter from a young woman who taught school in a central 
Indiana farm town. She had seen my column in the Gary (Ind.) paper and thought 
I lived there. She invited me to her wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick happened to be passing through the city room and I caught up with him and 
handed him the letter, for laughs. He speed-read it and handed it back.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're going, of course," he said. My mouth fell open. "When a lady invites a 
gentleman from The Times to her wedding," he said, "he goes." 
</P>
<P>
 I went. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick's secret life emerges in full flower in these essays. He wrote of 
watching a movie scene in which James Bond was plying a gorgeous blonde with 
caviar and ice-cold vodka. "We were out of vodka but I chilled two ounces of 
old Dr. Gordon's Home Specific. Canned anchovies on rye substituted for the 
caviar. The blonde didn't seem essential to the formula, and I was, if only for 
a moment, James Bond himself. Or Walter Mitty." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the essays were written from Trinidad, the tiny Northern California 
town where Nick lived briefly after his retirement. But most are datelined 
Laguna Beach, where he lived with his second wife, Barbara Steele Williams, 
until his death, in 1992, at 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick's wonderment is perhaps best expressed in a piece called, "What's It All 
About, Alfie?" He asked that question of himself, remembering advice given by 
the sportswriter Grantland Rice years before: "Don't hurry. Don't worry, and 
don't forget to smell the flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here in Laguna Beach, this time of year," he reflected, "it is entirely 
possible to let time slither over you, and to forget . . . that this past one 
was not the best of summers. And to believe, from what you see about you, that 
winter will be better and that spring, next year, will mark the swinging of the 
pendulum. The sun goes down and even as it does the moon is rising. Just keep 
breathing." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick abhorred exercise, pointing out to his wife that the only exercise tigers 
take is stretching. He was suspicious of what he called "the illusory and 
perilous pursuit of youth. . . . I am not one who blasphemes exercise. It has 
its place. It may be beneficial in some instances, but I shrink -- I've shrunk 
a full inch since the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower -- but I shrink from 
anything that takes me from my contemplation of the eternal truths." 
</P>
<P>
 From his stretch of beach, Nick watched the eternal struggle of life in the 
sea and the sky. He was bemused by the humiliation of his cat, Tom, by a mother 
mockingbird. "The technique of these lady mockingbirds is murderous, and yet 
one is compelled to admire their skill. They flutter six or so feet over the 
next cat that they intend to brutalize, emitting raucous cries, and then they 
dive straight down like Stukas -- POW! -- zooming toward the sky before their 
stricken victims can strike back." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick fancied himself a cook. He spent an entire afternoon in the kitchen 
trying to make a mincemeat pie like his grandmother used to make. Inspired by 
some bits of leftover steak, he threw in everything he could find -- cinnamon, 
cloves, mace, fruit and chopped suet -- adding brandy and nipping at it 
frequently from the bottle. When his wife came home she asked what he had made 
-- some kind of glue? He said: "'Throw it away, and bring me several aspirin." 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote on the demise of skinny-dipping, the war between the mockingbirds and 
the crows, the sea gull who came to dinner, whales, the stars, the strange bird 
in the bathrobe and the return of the bad news birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick was aware of his mortality. He recalled a trip to Rome when he and his 
first wife, Elizabeth, found themselves at John Keats' grave and read his 
epitaph: "Here lies one whose name was writ in water." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick reflected: "But in the hush I doubt poor Keats now really cared."

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; CAMPY, POST-REALIST ROMP -- WITH A DOSE OF MURDER; RENT 
BOY BY GARY INDIANA ; SERPENT'S TAIL, $10.99, PAPERBACK; 115 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 OK, so the 500 channels of the "information superhighway" will target 
increasingly tiny mini-audiences. Fiction seems to be headed that way too, 
although it isn't all the authors' fault; the reading public has been 
splintering on its own, and books can only follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: "Rent Boy," Gary Indiana's novel about gay hustlers in New York 
City who get involved in a crooked doctor's plan to murder people and sell 
their body parts to hospitals for transplants. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a funny book with a high degree of linguistic sophistication. It also 
contains all the four-letter words, plus graphic descriptions of sex, kinky 
perversions, drug abuse and mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick imaginary survey of American readers shows that 40% would condemn 
Indiana and his works, unread, to perdition. Another 27% -- the same kind of 
folks who gave us the "don't ask, don't tell" policy on gays in the military -- 
would leave "Rent Boy" alone, so long as they didn't have to read it 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remainder, 8.6% would read the book, discover a whole new world and be 
moved to sympathy. These would be more than offset by the 11.1% who would read 
the book, discover a whole new world and think that Indiana's description of it 
only confirmed their prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the 13.3% for whom Indiana is actually writing. They are readers 
for whom this isn't a new world at all -- Jean Genet and John Rechy opened up 
the territory a generation ago, and Indiana's narrator, Danny, reads the 
stories of Dennis Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 They are readers who not only won't be shocked by the realism of this novel 
but will recognize it for the campy, post-realist romp it partly is. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly, because Indiana ("Horse Crazy," "Scar Tissue & Other Stories") seems 
to want it both ways. Danny, the "rent boy" of the title, is in search of love 
and meaning as he studies architecture, waits tables in a restaurant catering 
to trendy writers, and sells himself to businessmen. He's a distant, debauched 
cousin of Holden Caulfield -- a youthful truth-teller who sees himself 
surrounded by phonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've overheard a million john life stories and another million whore 
life stories and . . . the john's story is always 'I'm lonely,' and the whore's 
story is always 'I come from a dysfunctional family,' " Danny says cynically -- 
although he is from a dysfunctional family and is as lonely as any of his 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Indiana's control is less certain than J. D. Salinger's was in "The 
Catcher in the Rye." Danny is supposed to be telling the story in letters to an 
ex-lover, but that relationship never comes into focus. His quieter tones of 
voice keep getting drowned out by derisive glee. He piles on details of dress 
and decor and slang simply because it's too much fun to stop; he turns the 
other characters into cartoon figures, especially the doctor, Crashnitz, and 
his nurse, Mavis: 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . back to the ratty blond hair and so forth, but with some brand-new 
touches, for example a dozen clanking bracelets on each arm, and a green Mylar 
dress that made her breasts look strange, fishnet black stockings and red heels 
and a makeup job which, given her square chin and all, gave the very faint 
impression of like an incipient beard. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It comes as a bit of a surprise to find that Indiana can use the same 
stylistic extravagance to deeper purpose, as when Danny contemplates the murder 
plot: 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you what the cocktail lounge at the Ramada's like, think of dark 
Formica and grainy indirect lighting and emotions collecting in front of you in 
the little puddles formed by your cocktail glass, islands and continents of 
feelings you don't know how to place anymore, and voices, the so-called human 
element, that remind you you're chained to the earth by a million little 
details: . . . They might as well be called Mavis or Stanley or Chip, or the 
boy who ran away from home to learn fear . . . or just a client whose 
loneliness and despair jut out on his face in the seconds before he comes. . . 
. So, maybe I found my will in the Ramada Inn, who knows."

THEATER REVIEW; CASTING'S JUST ONE BUG IN 'OLEANNA'; MAMET INSUFFICIENTLY DRAWS 
THE CHARACTERS IN HIS POLITICAL TRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversial casting of David Mamet's "Oleanna" for its Los Angeles 
premiere has made a bad play worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mamet insisted on casting a longtime colleague, Lionel Mark Smith, as the 
professor who's accused of sexual harassment by one of his students. Producers 
at the Mark Taper Forum, where the play had been scheduled to open last month, 
objected and canceled their production. Smith, who is black, charged the Taper 
with racism -- a charge the Taper emphatically denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the play is at the 99-seat Tiffany Theatre, a better home for this 
small-scaled clash between two characters than the more expansive Taper would 
have been. It's much easier for the audience to feel trapped, along with the 
man in the play, at the Tiffany than it would have been at the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Oleanna" still doesn't work. And while the casting of Smith and Kyra 
Sedgwick is part of the problem, the larger problem is the play itself. It has 
only one thing going for it: timeliness. Otherwise, it's a shrill political 
tract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oleanna" is as rigged as a play can get. Its hero-victim is a professor, 
preoccupied with his own searches for tenure and a new house, who nonetheless 
takes a few moments in his office to bring a personal touch to his instruction 
of Carol -- a young, troubled student of questionable intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Act One, we observe the two of them misunderstanding each other. Then, 
after intermission we learn that Carol has accused her Mr. Chips of 
improprieties. By play's end, she has metamorphosed into what Rush Limbaugh 
would call a femi-Nazi. 
</P>
<P>
 She outlandishly charges the professor, John, with attempted rape, and submits 
a list of books that he must ban in his classes if he wants any relief. 
Finally, her criticism of one of his casual comments drives him over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would John ever consent to a second private interview with this creature, 
let alone a third? Apparently he's overly confident of his own persuasive 
powers. Ah yes, a tragic flaw -- and who says they don't write classics any 
more? 
</P>
<P>
 If the play were presented as a cartoon, Mamet's caricatured Carol might 
suffice. (Such a presentation also might have the leeway to explain that opaque 
title, "Oleanna," which refers to a 19th-Century Utopian community.) 
</P>
<P>
 But here we're in the land of Mamet hyper-realism, complete with the usual 
complement of 4,800 half-finished sentences. Here, we ought to be able to take 
the characters as seriously as we take the issues.  
</P>
<P>
 But when Mamet creates his characters out of straw, his point of view seems 
equally flimsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there probably have been PC commandos as outrageous as Carol. But the 
play would hit much closer to home if Carol were a person instead of a symbol. 
Or if we saw some representative of the mainstream -- someone who, like most of 
us, isn't sure who to believe when it's one person's word against another's. 
Or, for that matter, if John himself weren't quite so blameless in the first 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As played by Smith, John's biggest fault is that he can be slightly pompous or 
too easily distracted by the telephone. He doesn't betray a trace of sexual 
interest in Carol, even to himself. Yet Sedgwick, despite heroic attempts to 
appear disheveled in the first scene, is a very glamorous-looking Carol. Under 
these circumstances, the play's complexity suffers along with its credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the fact that Smith is black. This is hard to overlook when John 
ironically grumbles about his "white man's burden" -- a phrase that Carol later 
throws back in his face. It becomes even more perplexing when Sedgwick, who is 
white, hectors John about his power and privileges and compares them to her own 
struggles. Even though she tells him it's not his race that brought him down, 
she still begins to sound like a racist as well as a feminist. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Mamet wants to say that extremists of all stripes sound alike. But 
it's likely that a white feminist might pointedly refrain from targeting a 
black professor, so as not to dilute her own cause with questions of race, as 
Mamet has done here in his casting. 
</P>
<P>
 Director William H. Macy created the man's role in the original production, 
and Smith and Sedgwick have mastered most -- although not quite all -- of 
Mamet's rapid-fire exchanges. It's not as if strangers have mangled Mamet's 
intentions. No, blame this one on Mamet himself. 
</P>

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; THE STANDARDS FOR SHOWING NUDITY ON THE BIG SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan O'Neill's Counterpunch, "Male Nudity on Film: What, Not Even a Peek?" 
(Jan. 31), suggests a double standard of nudity that doesn't actually exist. 
With both men and women, mainstream, R-rated films show pubic hair but not the 
flesh beneath the pubic hair. Were a major film to attempt to show 
gynecological detail, it would be rated NC-17. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill was done a disservice by having his article published directly beneath 
an opinion piece on "Schindler's List." I can safely assume that I was not the 
only reader who involuntarily remembered that "Schindler's List" has full male 
nudity and was rated R. 
</P>

<P>
 Thank you, Dan, for your astute observation on the lack of male nudity in 
film. Can we all finally admit that female nudity in film is not "art" per se 
but merely a gratuitous ingredient and, if not, then that it is the fantasy of 
the male director? I say male because they account for most directors. 
</P>
<P>
 This goes for Western art as well -- what about Manet's famous painting 
"Dejeuner sur l'herbe": two fully dressed men picnicking with one naked woman. 
Need I guess the ratio of female nudes against male nudes in Western art? 
</P>
<P>
 I do not have hang-ups about nudity nor male fantasy, but I do have hang-ups 
about representation in art-media of male fantasy 99% of the time. And I have 
hang-ups about objectification of women and their constant portrayal as victims 
of violence, rape and murder. It is not healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman's (not necessarily feminist) point of view in art-media 50% of the 
time is absolutely necessary. I think focusing on individuals and individuality 
is far more interesting.

 Do we really need to hear O'Neill's desire to have a "peek" or a "glimpse" of 
a penis in American movies? Is this appropriate for The Times -- or any 
publication? 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill rationalizes that since nude women are so prevalent, there should 
equally be naked men. But more nudity in films is not artistic progress, it's 
just further degradation of our society.

 Sex is great fun to do, but not always interesting to watch. I've gotten so 
tired of the obligatory movie sack scene that I now take it as my cue to get 
popcorn. I'm not prudish, just bored. 
</P>
<P>
 When will critics like O'Neill spend their energies demanding more genuine 
artistic risk taking, better-written scripts, even genuinely original "original 
music"? But noooo -- O'Neill goes so far as to equate frontally nude men with 
"the truth."

DANCE; INTELLIGENCE SHOWS IN GILLILAND'S 'RAW / BONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Except for her assaultive, engulfing woman's quartet "Coriolanus," the pieces 
presented by Stephanie Gilliland at Cal State L.A. on Friday proved far too 
thoughtful and complex for her program title, "Raw and to the Bone." 
</P>
<P>
 This locally based postmodernist clearly identifies with the risk-oriented, 
stamina-testing movement theater gathering converts in the community.However, 
Gilliland's intelligence, sense of craft and sensitivity to emotional values in 
dancing kept her work demanding more sophisticated responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, "The Men's Piece" had plenty of brute athleticism but also moments 
when the five jocks paused to get into their feelings before launching a new 
round of intense jogging or high-diving gymnastics.  
</P>
<P>
 Midway, Gilliland paired off guys in pants with guys in skirtlets -- possibly 
a wry, feminist joke (like the party dresses in "Coriolanus"). 
</P>
<P>
 Feminist concepts of sexual politics and empowerment also colored other 
pieces, from the solidarity of the wonder women in "Coriolanus" to the 
isolation of Gilliland and Michael Cecconi in her lush, turbulent, untitled 
duet. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Furniture Pieces," Gilliland chose a table, chairs, a mattress and 
even a cat's carpet-covered scratching post (a tunnel, actually) as platforms 
for dancing. Along with the use of kneepads and gymnastics, the changing 
architectural deployment of these objects labeled the style as L.A. Modern, 
'94.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Gilliland's thematic focus on hyper-extended stretches unified the 
suite and helped give it a distinctive sensuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The chair duet for Gilliland and Cheryl Graham, for example, featured intimate 
lifts and holds, competitive jockeying for position and an intriguing, 
enigmatic subtextual drama. A symbolic power struggle perhaps? A love 
relationship? Tonya and Nancy?

COUNTERPUNCH: THE FINE ARTS CAN DRAW IN CITIZENS OF INDIFFERENCE; MUSIC CENTER: 
HEAL THYSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOCKNEY, David Hockney is a noted artist and scenic designer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was quite surprised to hear of the Music Center hosting a discussion, "Can 
the Arts Help to Heal L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
 While I agree with Times Art Critic Christopher Knight that art is not 
therapy, perhaps the Music Center should heal itself first. It could start by 
getting rid of its provincial insecurity. 
</P>
<P>
 I have worked at the Music Center as a designer -- the opera company is fine, 
backstage is very good and helpful, but I have been put off working there again 
by the Founders, a dining room that functions as a private club in a public, 
tax-supported institution. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an ugly building inside and out, and for anyone who can read 
architectural space the most vulgar part is the Founders room taking up more 
space than all the other facilities combined. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a welcoming place for visitors. Indeed, I would say of all the 
places in the world I have been to concerts or opera, the Music Center is the 
least user-friendly of any place I know. 
</P>
<P>
 This is simply due the fact that the Founders just doesn't notice how dull and 
awkward the rest of the space is. If I go to a long opera in San Francisco, I 
can eat and drink there quite easily, without having to book a table and 
without knowing anybody there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My own experiences with the Music Center have sometimes been acutely 
embarrassing. Invited in to have drinks, my guests have been told they were not 
dressed properly. My European friends simply didn't know how to react, and as I 
dress up every day of my life I'm not too keen on sartorial rules myself. This 
has happened nowhere else I have ever worked. 
</P>
<P>
 It now seems to me to be run by a very small-minded clique (who I've no desire 
to meet) that has really put me off working there again, especially as it's 
always finished up costing me money in the work I have done there. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, San Francisco is very friendly to all who come. Sometimes I don't 
know what's wrong with L.A.

COUNTERPUNCH: THE FINE ARTS CAN DRAW IN CITIZENS OF INDIFFERENCE; A RESILIENT 
L.A. AND ITS ARTS BENEFIT EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND D. EDELMAN, Edmund D. Edelman represents the 3rd District, which 
includes the Wilshire museum corridor, on the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Los Angeles continues to dig itself out from the Jan. 17 earthquake, this 
latest in an apparently endless series of calamities, we again confront the 
question: Can the arts help to heal L.A.? Or, as Times Art Critic Christopher 
Knight put it (Calendar, Jan. 17), "Can L.A. Help Heal the Arts?" 
</P>
<P>
 I submit that the answer to both questions is a resounding "Yes!" Despite a 
series of disasters that would have forced most communities to their knees, the 
residents of Los Angeles County are demonstrating an impressive and resourceful 
resilience. And nowhere has this been more true than in their renewed 
commitment to supporting the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout history, the power of artistic expression has nourished the spirit, 
illuminated the human condition, exalted our creativity, bound together 
communities and helped build mighty civilizations. Even in troubled times -- 
especially in troubled times -- we must maintain our support for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the earthquake itself, for example, the County of Los Angeles 
resolved a longstanding funding dispute with Museum Associates, the private, 
nonprofit support group formed to manage the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 
which will pave the way for an aggressive new expansion program to revitalize 
Wilshire Boulevard's Miracle Mile as a new Miracle Mile and Museum District. 
</P>
<P>
 The County and the Museum Associates have enjoyed a long and close cooperative 
relationship, wherein the county donated public land and agreed to maintain and 
operate an art museum, while the associates agreed to raise funds to build 
facilities and acquire artworks to display. This model public-private 
partnership has established a museum of world-class stature and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 This once-harmonious arrangement has been sorely tested by the lingering 
recession and related county budget woes. But, as the proverb says, in crisis 
there is also opportunity, and we have seized it. When the chance arose to 
purchase and preserve the classic Streamline Moderne May Co. property adjacent 
to the museum, I was able to bring the parties together and mediate a 
resolution of the ongoing funding dispute aimed at ensuring a measure of 
stability in museum funding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This agreement made it possible for the county to assist in the purchase of 
the May Co. on favorable terms for the museum with no cost to the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting expanded County Art Museum will eventually join the Natural 
History Museum's soon-to-open Peterson Automotive Museum (formerly Ohrbach's, 
directly across Wilshire Boulevard), its George C. Page Museum at the La Brea 
Tar Pits, and the Craft and Folk Art Museum in reinvigorating L.A.'s Miracle 
Mile as a premier museum destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cultural attractions enrich the lives and ennoble the spirits of millions 
of residents and visitors annually. I do no disservice to our arts community in 
asserting that they are also important and valued contributors to our local 
economy.  
</P>
<P>
 As I've noted before, unless we maintain and improve our arts institutions and 
cherish the civilizing contributions they make to our quality of life, there is 
little reason for many people to come to and remain living in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight notwithstanding, we should support art for art's sake, as well as for 
our sake.

COUNTERPUNCH: THE FINE ARTS CAN DRAW IN CITIZENS OF INDIFFERENCE; URBAN LESSON: 
NO MORE WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL WACHS, Joel Wachs represents Los Angeles' 2nd District on the City 
Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there's one lesson to be learned from the civil unrest in Los Angeles, it's 
that we can't build walls high enough to escape from what's happening in 
society today. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap between rich and poor, ethnic and racial tensions, and the enormous 
complexity of culturally diverse communities present a disturbing picture in 
which the root cause is indifference. It is in this context that we should 
explore the critical role that the arts can play in healing a divided city 
("The Question Should Be: Can L.A. Help Heal the Arts?," Calendar, Jan. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, art can't fix everything, nor is healing necessarily its primary 
purpose. But the arts are a way of communicating the anguish in our lives, and 
they are a way of connecting people with one another. They do help us 
understand ourselves and the world around us. And that is precisely what we 
need to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if there's one thing I've seen around our city, it's that people are 
crying out to be heard. They do have something to say and they want an 
opportunity to say it. Ironically, two of the most effective vehicles through 
which they can do so are politics and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Think for a moment about "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," the Mark Taper Forum's 
remarkable production by Anna Deavere Smith. It is exactly what our city needs 
if we ever hope to understand our differences. Not because it had a particular 
agenda -- in fact, some criticized it for not having one -- but because it was 
a powerfully compelling vehicle through which so many different but eloquent 
voices could be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had the money, I'd bring "Twilight" to every community in Los Angeles. 
Just as I would make the movie "El Norte" available to every Angeleno who cares 
about what it's like to be an immigrant in society today. 
</P>
<P>
 The arts may not give us all the answers, but they can certainly lift us to a 
higher level of questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, artists have been speaking to the alienation in our society for 
generations. And their voices have made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 When artist Barbara Kruger spoke so poignantly about "our bodies as a 
battleground," it was as much an angry warning and call to action at the time, 
as it is now an encapsulation of what happened since. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, hip-hop has reflected the class and race relationships 
in a culture of underclass youth, though few of us have taken the time to 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in the aftermath of the riots, one of the first programs our city 
initiated was an Arts Recovery Fund to encourage artists to address these 
concerns. It's part of our continuing effort to support a broad range of 
artists and arts organizations seeking to address the ethnic, racial, cultural, 
class and generational divisions in our city. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Los Angeles Arts Endowment was one of the first governmental 
programs to embrace the burning issues of cultural equity, such as: 
</P>
<P>
 * Who owns our institutions? 
</P>
<P>
 * Who makes the decisions? 
</P>
<P>
 * Who comprises the staffs and boards? 
</P>
<P>
 * Who defines the art? 
</P>
<P>
 * Who is impacted by it? 
</P>
<P>
 * To whom is it accessible? 
</P>
<P>
 * Whose lives and concerns are being addressed? 
</P>
<P>
 As we look to heal a troubled city, it is not a new voice with which artists 
speak, but rather a voice with a renewed sense of urgency. And the questions of 
cultural equity, and their insistence upon inclusivity, are paramount to any 
meaningful effort at healing. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in a city of remarkable diversity, with tensions seething beneath the 
surface. Yet, it is from this diversity that we must ultimately draw our 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only do so if we learn to understand and respect each others' 
differences -- to see the best in each other, and accept ourselves for who we 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's through self-expression for Skid Row youth at Inner City Arts, or 
a festival celebrating African American and Middle Eastern cultures in Leimert 
Park; whether it's the angry voices and personal pride of a Gay and Lesbian 
Film Festival, or a new Japanese American Museum in Little Tokyo; whether it's 
a mural in East Los Angeles, or searching commentary in publications like High 
Performance and Art Issues; there is really no better way to do so than through 
the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the saving grace of our society is the beauty and understanding that 
the arts can create in the midst of turmoil and heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 We must never underestimate their potential. We must continue to give them our 
support.

STAGE; BROOKS TAKS 'PAUL ROBESON' BEYOND SCRIPT'S BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He laughs, cries, sings, dances, preaches, mugs, testifies.  
</P>
<P>
 He plays dozens of characters in one night. Avery Brooks does about everything 
an actor has ever wanted to do in "Paul Robeson," his star turn at the Westwood 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 While he does it all very well, Brooks is as remarkable for his stamina as for 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a performance that goes on for nearly 2 hours, 45 minutes, and Brooks 
has done it hundreds of times, including a stint at the Westwood two years ago. 
But his attention to each moment never lapses. Nor does his big, booming voice. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle he drives, Phillip Hayes Dean's script, is nothing to shout about. 
The tone is largely reverential, seldom introspective, and mostly structured as 
a succession of dozens of anecdotes.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the limits of the genre, Brooks frequently finds himself forced to 
awkwardly repeat the comments of the people with whom Robeson is conversing. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wants an accurate picture of the real Robeson would be better off 
reading a biography. Dean used his dramatic license frequently to create more 
of a show.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, one whole sequence has Robeson experiencing epiphanies in Africa 
and on the voyage back to America, but the real Robeson never traveled in 
sub-Saharan Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks is masterfully accompanied at the piano, and occasionally in spoken 
dialogues, by Ernie Scott.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the dramatic highlight of the evening is the familiar dialogue (it 
has been used in other plays as well) between Robeson and a congressional 
interrogator played by Scott. This exchange is so fiery that one wishes the 
whole play were less of a monodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for the most part Brooks' showmanship -- and the thought that this may 
indeed inspire someone to read more about the legendary entertainer and 
activist -- justifies the show. 
</P>
<P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; A TUNEFUL, PERSONABLE TEENAGE FANCLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most bands that mine '60s and '70s musical veins -- as the Scottish quartet 
Teenage Fanclub did on Saturday at the Palace -- do so to fuel either angry 
statements or snide cultural jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 But this show was neither catharsis nor comedy, although it was closer to the 
latter, what with an encore of the 1910 Fruitgum Company's "Goody Goody 
Gumdrops." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if we haven't heard this tight blend of power and pop before, from 
Big Star (Alex Chilton's "Free Again" provided another encore) to L.A.'s own 
Redd Kross.  
</P>
<P>
 And Saturday it wasn't quite as rich as it could have been, with guitarist 
Raymond McGinley, one of the group's three lead singers, silent due to a sore 
throat, leaving guitarist Norman Blake and bassist Gerard Love to do their best 
on the precise harmonies that mark many of the Fanclub songs.  
</P>
<P>
 But that diminished neither the attractive tunefulness nor the personable 
Fanclub presence -- Blake may have set a record for sincere "thank yous" to the 
crowd. And doesn't that beat a snarl or a sneer any day? 
</P>
<P>
 Opening act Yo La Tengo also mined a familiar vein: the Velvet Underground. 
But the New Jersey trio is one of the few to really capture the magnetic 
mystery of the Velvets, a sound that's like listening to a busted radio picking 
up a transmission from far away. STEVE HOCHMAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; BADURA-SKODA JOINS L.A. MOZART GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lucinda Carver led the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra in a sprightly, if 
troubled Mozart program Saturday at the Wilshire-Ebell Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempos inclined to be fast, precision was not a certain thing and lyric 
expressivity, it seemed, had to be caught on the fly.Still, Carver appeared 
incapable of conducting without showing intelligent choices and an overall 
sense of style. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the program was the great C-minor piano concerto, K. 491. 
The conductor shaped the opening theme with an intriguing sighing affect, but 
unfortunately abandoned the idea even before the soloist, the eminent Austrian 
pianist Paul Badura-Skoda, made his entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing on a Bosendorfer concert grand, Badura-Skoda, 66, demonstrated 
brilliance and clarity and sensitive use of light and shade. Yet, overall it 
was not an emotionally probing interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Larghetto, he seemed to be trying to establish a more flexible, singing 
line than the conductor wanted and that might have made a difference. But he 
was not entirely successful. He played his own cadenza in the first movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The winds, so crucial in this work, could have made a stronger profile. They 
sounded unused to being in the spotlight. Except as noted, the conductor 
followed the soloist closely, and together they keep a healthy balance between 
the big modern instrument and the chamber size of the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Carver had opened the program with an energetic and transparent account of the 
Overture to "Le Nozze di Figaro." After intermission, she led the group in the 
Divertimento in F, K. 138, and the "Haffner" Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the strings sounded under-rehearsed in the little divertimento, 
composed when the composer was 16, playing with tentative articulation and 
wandering focus. A speedy, spirited account of the symphony, with more than the 
usual nod to the timpani, however, closed the program. CHRIS PASLES

MUSIC REVIEWS; ARTISTRY, RESTRAINT IN BLOCHWITZ RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Word-of-mouth, and print, about Hans Peter Blochwitz had evidently reached the 
Los Angeles area, to judge by the sizable, tuned-in audience present in 
Ambassador Auditorium on Saturday for the German tenor's local debut. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer proved tentative in his approach to the first two of the five 
Schubert favorites that opened a program hardly notable for musical substance: 
an earthbound "Musensohn" and "Geheimes."But there was charm and sweetness of 
tone in the subsequent "Heidenroslein," while the requisite sense of uneasy 
calm was communicated in a hushed, fine-spun "Wanderers Nachtlied." The vocal 
heft and dramatic intensity required by "Erlkonig," however, proved suitable 
neither to the tenor's intimate style nor his soft-grained, fragile instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer and songs were in harmony for much of the subsequent group of Brahms' 
German folksong arrangements, remarkably so in the musical innocence masking 
the cruel textual heart of "Es ging ein Maidlein zarte," and the gentle humor 
of "Wie komm ich denn zur Tur herein." 
</P>
<P>
 Other rewards came in a selection of folksong settings by Benjamin Britten, 
outstanding among them those that took advantage of the singer's gift for the 
simple, telling vocal and verbal inflection: "Little Sir William," another bit 
of gore disguised as folksy innocence, whose denouement proved particularly 
chilling in Blochwitz's understated delivery; the touching "The Trees They Grow 
So High," and "The Salley Gardens," its text flawlessly enunciated, the 
poignant accompaniment delivered with utmost grace by Eric Schneider, elsewhere 
a fluent if often overly reticent partner at the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two operatic arias listed, "Una furtiva lagrima" from Donizetti's 
"L'Elisir d'Amore" lacked sensuousness of tone while stretching Blochwitz's 
instrument to its outermost limits, whereas Lenski's aria, "Kuda, kuda," from 
Tchaikovsky's "Evgeny Onegin" at once touched the heart and ravished the ear 
through sensitive word-painting and dynamic subtlety. HERBERT GLASS

UNLIKELY LAKERS STEP UP TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ID check from the Forum on Sunday night: 
</P>
<P>
 That really was the Lakers winning for the fifth time in their last eight 
games, a 107-90 victory over the Utah Jazz before 11,777. 
</P>
<P>
 That really was CBA-claimer Reggie Jordan, scoring a game-high 28 points in 25 
minutes in only his fifth NBA appearance, a showing that will probably earn him 
a contract for the rest of the season when his second 10-day deal expires 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 That really was James Worthy, who had shot 21.7% the previous six games, 
hitting 12 of 19 en route to 26 points. And that was Tony Smith, at 39.1% 
coming in and in danger of losing his starting job to Sedale Threatt because of 
lack of offense, scoring 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No, that really was not Dennis Rodman playing center for the Lakers. That was 
Vlade Divac, getting 23 rebounds while playing all but one minute, but scoring 
only five points. 
</P>
<P>
 "So don't be surprised if I come to the next game wearing purple hair," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he would be color-coordinated with the road uniforms, but the Lakers 
wouldn't care if Divac came with a two-tone beard as long as he continues like 
this. In the last three games, he has pulled down 23, 19 and 15 rebounds. In 
the last six, he is averaging 15.2 per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan came in at the other end of the spectrum. Four games, 11 minutes, four 
shots, one success. He was practice fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 Then this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the guys were rooting for Reggie," Coach Randy Pfund said, noting 
that his reserves became more charged the closer the Lakers got to their fourth 
consecutive home victory, the longest run in a year. "That's what I sensed. I'm 
not so sure what goes on behind me; they're probably making faces at me. But I 
sensed our team and the crowd getting into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, a New Mexico State product whose previous distinction was making the 
CBA all-star team, only got this chance because Nick Van Exel had two fouls 
before the game was three minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only one of the lowlights during a first quarter in which the Lakers 
scored only 10 points, their fewest in a period this season. Pfund then dipped 
into a bench that was already thin at guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel played three minutes in the first half, but the Lakers, behind a 
30-point second quarter, still had a 40-39 advantage at the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 When the second half opened, Van Exel had two more fouls within two Jazz 
possessions, again sending him to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan picked up the pieces. He made four of five shots in the third quarter, 
good for eight points. In the fourth, when the Jazz got as close as three 
points before the Lakers pulled away with about four minutes to go, Jordan 
scored 14 points, many on twisting moves under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing those moves sometimes," he said. "But, yeah, I surprised 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Himself and everyone else. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The starting lineup remained intact Sunday, but Coach Randy Pfund said he has, 
and will, consider replacing Tony Smith with Sedale Threatt. "Last week I 
looked at it, but I knew that Tony was a better matchup for Jim Jackson (of the 
Dallas Mavericks)," Pfund said. "In both games, I've (substituted) Sedale for 
Tony so we could get both our quick guards on the court at once. Yeah, that 
might be something we consider going to. Tony has not shot the ball well." 
Smith, the Lakers' best defensive guard, was shooting only 36.5% over the 
previous nine games heading into Sunday. . . . The Lakers say there is an 
outside chance Doug Christie could play Thursday against Sacramento at the 
Forum, what would be his first appearance since suffering a sprained ankle Jan.

MILLER FINDS TIME HAS NOT YET PASSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Johnny Miller, the 46-year-old golfer-turned-announcer-turned-golfer, won his 
third -- and most unexpected -- title in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, a 
one-stroke victory over Tom Watson on Sunday that was a throwback to another 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Down the stretch, we both putted like old folks," Miller said. "It was a 
round that gave hope to everybody who's older." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Watson, 44, lost his putting touch. On the last three holes he 
missed putts of four, three and six feet. Had he made any one of them, a 
playoff would have been in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my younger career, I lived by the putter," Watson said. "Today, I died by 
the putter." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a television commentator who was playing in only his sixth tour event 
since 1989, and Watson, captain of the last American Ryder Cup team and a Hall 
of Famer, struggled to rounds of two-over-par 74 in cold, wind and occasional 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
 But Watson's late lapses made Miller a winner at seven-under 281. He earned 
$225,000, a figure he has exceeded in only one season since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his first victory since 1987 -- which also came in this unique event 
sponsored by AT&T -- and only his second since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 And it might signal a change in lifestyle for the man who all but abandoned 
tournament golf five years ago to become a golf commentator for NBC. He still 
has a full schedule with the network, but he now will try to squeeze in a few 
more playing appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of changes my plans," said Miller, who hadn't expected to play 
competitively again this year. "I've guess I'll play in the Masters and the 
Tournament of Champions." 
</P>
<P>
 The former U.S. and British Open winner let Watson make the mistakes and 
brought home a victory with a decisive string of five consecutive pars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like it wasn't really happening to me, like it was a dream," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 More like a nightmare for Watson, who has not won since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a two-shot lead and five holes to go, but failed to get up and down 
from a bunker on the 14th, missing an eight-foot putt. That cut the lead to one 
and the winner of the 1982 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach three-putted for bogey 
from nearly 15 feet on the 16th, missing a four-foot second putt. 
</P>
<P>
 That pulled them even. Watson three-putted again on the 17th, grazing the cup 
from 35 feet, then failing on a three-footer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 18th, Watson missed a six-footer for birdie and a tie.

DUCKS BEATEN AT OWN GAME, 3-2; HOCKEY: BLACKHAWKS PROVE MORE ADEPT AND 
EXPERIENCED AT PHYSICAL STYLE OF PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That was good old-fashioned Mighty Duck hockey Sunday at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that the Chicago Blackhawks have 60-odd more years of experience at 
it, and they beat the Ducks, 3-2, before a sellout crowd of 17,174. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the Ducks spans only 56 games, but they know the tradition they 
want to adopt and it isn't very pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's game was textbook. They fought, they mucked, they dumped, they 
chased, they bumped, they grinded. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, so did the Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago plays physical, we play physical," Coach Ron Wilson said. "It was a 
good game, great from start to end. Maybe not in terms of flow or puck 
movement, but in terms of physical, gritty hockey -- old-fashioned hockey, good 
old-fashioned Chicago Blackhawk hockey. That's our style, too, and both teams 
were up to it." 
</P>
<P>
 So it was good for the Ducks, better for the Blackhawks -- and at times quite 
dreary for the fans, except perhaps for the four fights and numerous scuffles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just try to get the puck in deep. It may be like watching paint dry to our 
fans, but it's the only way we're going to beat these guys," Peter Douris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, trying to fend off a vengeful Blackhawk team that they embarrassed, 
6-2, at Chicago Stadium last month, scored first on a goal by Joe Sacco. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chicago took a 3-1 lead before the first period was over, on goals by 
Steve Smith, Jeremy Roenick -- a weak one that trickled between Guy Hebert's 
pads -- and Stephane Matteau. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks cut their deficit to one goal at 17:06 of the second period, when 
Troy Loney scored off Eric Weinrich's giveaway in his defensive zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago goalie Ed Belfour survived the rest of the Ducks' shots, and their 
best chances slipped through their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second half of the game, Eddie Belfour shut the door on us, plus he had a 
little luck with some posts," Wilson said. "That's the way it goes. You can't 
really be upset with our effort. We outshot and outchanced them." 
</P>
<P>
 Though they lost this one, the Ducks are playing better at home, with a .500 
record in their last eight games. They are also playing some of their most 
physical hockey of the season, largely behind the tag team known as "Stuie and 
Ewie" to their teammates -- Stu Grimson and Todd Ewen. Between them, they 
fought three times in the first period, and Ewen went at it with Chicago's Cam 
Russell 79 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stu and Todd have started throwing their weight around," said left wing Tim 
Sweeney. "I think we needed to play more physically. I think we were trying too 
much to show our fans we could score goals. We forgot what wins games." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Grimson: "Looking back, it may have been the one element of our (home) 
game that was probably lacking. I think we could have on certain nights 
initiated more where that was concerned. As you see (today), we held our own 
physically, we played well physically. That may have been a problem for us 
through our real struggles at home, but I don't think you can point the finger 
at one specific thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewen says another factor is the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at what time of year it is," he said. "The points are a lot 
more desperate right now, and teams are looking for points along with playoff 
spots. Along with that extra pressure comes a lot more altercations." Duck 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson has called his goalies "No. 1 and 1A" all season, but Guy 
Hebert now has a decided edge over Ron Tugnutt and has started nine of the last 
11 games. "I think Guy has played solid the last month and his record is much 
better than Tugger's," Wilson said. "In the big games, I think he should be the 
guy in there right now. It's simple as that." . . . Chicago was without 
defenseman Chris Chelios, who is serving a four-game NHL suspension.

MORNING BRIEFING: U.S. JUSTICE IS IN THE EYE OF BEHOLDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canadian lawyer Richard Pound, who sits on the International Olympic 
Committee's executive board, said the U.S. Olympic Committee "doesn't have much 
of a choice" but to leave Tonya Harding on its Olympic team.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you have compelling evidence, such as a confession or a conviction, 
you don't have a basis on which to overturn the results," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 What about an indictment? 
</P>
<P>
 "Grand juries can indict fire hydrants in the U.S.," he said. "You couldn't 
take that seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Harding: Writes John Eisenberg of the Baltimore Sun: 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean the USOC won't go after Harding. That they want her off the 
team is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't blame them. Her presence would push the other athletes off the 
front page. 
</P>
<P>
 "The luge can't compete with TonyaGate."

 Trivia time: Who was the last Heisman Trophy winner not to attempt to play pro 
football? 
</P>
<P>
 So-so: What kind of player was Indiana Coach Bob Knight? 
</P>
<P>
 His Ohio State coach, Fred Taylor, said in a 1992 interview: 
</P>
<P>
 "He was as competitive as anyone I ever had. His intensity, his instincts and 
his intelligence were better than his physical talent.  
</P>
<P>
 "In practice once he got an elbow in an eye and was rushed to the infirmary, 
where they put nine stitches in him. He was back in 45 minutes, expecting to 
practice.  
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby was slow afoot, but was a very good shooter to 14 feet. At long range, 
he took shots he shouldn't have. From distance, he had a flat trajectory, a 
problem he never corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tease him every time I seem him. I tell him he teaches better defense than 
he played." 
</P>
<P>
 No thanks: Greg Gumbel, who will be the host for CBS' Winter Olympics coverage 
next week, on his reaction to a suggested interview with former President 
Richard Nixon: 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, (producer) Eric Mann wanted Nixon on as a guest on 'NFL 
Today,' " Gumbel said. "I said, 'If you do, I'm not doing the show. I will not 
talk to him. . . . I had six fraternity brothers, two teammates and several 
other friends who never came back from Vietnam.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective: From the June 5, 1910, Times sports section: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ty Cobb is accredited with getting $9,000 per season. . . . Frank Chance, the 
leader of the Chicago Cubs, gets around $10,000. And so does Christy Mathewson 
of the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are scores of men who get from $3,000 to $4,500, or far more than the 
vast majority of eminent ministers." 
</P>
<P>
 The article pointed out that "as recently" as 1885, players in the "world 
championship games" were happy to have received an extra $41 "on the rake-off."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Skategate is the least of my worries today. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'm more concerned with the plight of the UCLA Bruins, losers of two of their 
last three games, and the L.A. Kings, winners of one of their last nine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins' 16-point loss to Notre Dame showed that their 15-point loss to 
California was no fluke. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When their fast break isn't clicking, they are in trouble. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the two losses, UCLA has made one of 35 three-point shots. Congratulations 
to Charles O'Bannon for hitting the bull's-eye against Cal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A perimeter shooter in the tradition of Reggie Miller, Tracy Murray and Don 
MacLean is lacking. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bruins make it even harder on themselves by standing around when they 
go into their half-court offense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams are starting to adjust to us," Ed O'Bannon said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Then it must be time for the Bruins and Coach Jim Harrick to start making some 
adjustments themselves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA can't trade for an outside shooter, but the Kings can make a deal for a 
physical defenseman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, they should have done it weeks ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Will General Manager Nick Beverley wait until they are mathematically 
eliminated from the playoffs? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage last year, the Kings were in the midst of a stretch when they 
won only one of 10 games, but at least they were above .500 at 24-22-6. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Melrose ought to show some confidence in reserve goaltender Robb 
Stauber and give Kelly Hrudey a little rest from the nightly bombardments. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Most gory interview of the weekend: Al MacInnis of the Calgary Flames, blood 
trickling down his left cheek from a bandaged eye, talking to Paul Sunderland 
on Prime Ticket after scoring the winning goal against the Kings in overtime. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's upset loss wasn't the biggest suffered by a Pacific 10 Conference team 
Saturday.Washington defeated Arizona in Seattle for the third time in four 
years. This might have been the most surprising. The Wildcats aren't as strong 
as usual, but still figured to handle a team that was 2-15. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Already two games behind UCLA and one behind Cal, Arizona could virtually be 
out of the conference race by the time it leaves the Bay Area Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount (4-15) has the longest winning streak of any Division I 
school in the Southland, two games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 NBC did a poor job of updating Charles O'Bannon's physical condition after he 
was sidelined because of a wrist injury in the first half against Notre Dame. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA West Regional, March 24-26 at the Sports Arena, is sold out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 USC was outmanned, even when it had six players on the court Thursday at 
Pauley Pavilion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Raveling should start freshman guard Stais Boseman and center 
Avondre Jones the rest of the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Headlines in the Daily Trojan on Friday: "USC blows 2-0 lead, 101-72" and 
"Late 101-70 run propels UCLA to win." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Alumnus Jerry Buss has donated the use of the Forum for the inaugural USC 
Athletic Hall of Fame dinner May 21. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Spud Webb weighs 133, two pounds under the lightweight limit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Coach Doug Collins' Phenoms against Coach K.C. Jones' Sensations in 
the rookie game on NBA All-Star Saturday in Minneapolis. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Super Prep rates USC's football recruiting class as second best in the nation, 
behind Tennessee's. We'll be the judge of that in two or three years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I nominate Jody Reed, who signed a minor-league contract with the Milwaukee 
Brewers after turning down a $7.8-million, three-year offer from the Dodgers, 
for miscalculation-of-the-year honors. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When two teams are tied in the NHL standings, the one with games in hand, and 
not necessarily the most victories, should be listed first. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Greg Foster, 36, who beat Olympic bronze medalist Jack Pierce in 
the 60-meter hurdles and was voted the outstanding athlete of the Millrose 
Games at Madison Square Garden. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was refreshing to see Scott Simpson not take the stodgy PGA party line and, 
instead, defend the good, clean fun Bill Murray has had at Pebble Beach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan reportedly has removed Kevin Gilbride from the list of Phoenix 
Cardinals' offensive coordinator candidates.

 Alberto Tomba warmed up for the Winter Olympics by winning a World Cup slalom 
at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-time Olympic gold medal winner won by more than a second over Tomas 
Fogdoe, covering the two runs in 1 minute 32.47 seconds.It was Tomba's fourth 
slalom victory this season and his second in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's slalom was the first race in the Bavarian resort since Austrian star 
Ulrike Maier was killed during a women's downhill eight days ago. A men's 
downhill planned for Saturday was canceled. Tomba donated his prize money -- 
$17,000 -- to a foundation named after Maier to help victims of skiing 
accidents on the World Cup circuit.

 Czechoslovakia established itself as one of the favorites for the gold medal 
in hockey at the Winter Olympics by defeating Canada, 5-1, to win the 
pre-Olympic Sweden Hockey Games at Stockholm. The Czechs finished with a 3-0 
record. Canada, Sweden and Russia were 1-2.

QUICK BRAKE WORK MAKES DIFFERENCE AT DAYTONA

 Were it not for some heavy traffic, the winning Nissan would have had no 
trouble at all in the Rolex 24-Hours sports car endurance race that ended 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only real problem we had in 24 hours of racing was when Scott Pruett got 
into a situation with somebody getting in his way and forced him into the 
grass," said Paul Gentilozzi, who combined with Pruett, Butch Leitzinger and 
Steve Millen of New Zealand for the victory at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident caused a bent wheel and brake caliper that had to be changed 
every three or four hours. The crew was able to change the caliper and bleed 
the brakes in less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 That made it easy for the car, which led the final 14 hours 25 minutes, to 
handle the 63-car field that included eight of the new open-cockpit World 
Sports Cars, supposedly the new glamour machines of sports car racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Their best finish was ninth, with only three running at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning car fought off early challenges to finish 24 laps plus 2 minutes 
23.957 seconds ahead of a Porsche 911 Turbo, driven by Bob Wollek, Dominique 
Dupy and Juergen Barth. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning car covered 707 laps -- 2,516.92 miles -- on the 3.56-mile road 
course that included two-thirds of the 2 1/2-mile, high-banked oval and a 
narrow, twisting infield section. The Nissan averaged 104.8 m.p.h.

NBA ROUNDUP; THIS TIME, SHOT MISSES AND SUNS BEAT BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chicago Bulls' last trip to the America West Arena in Phoenix resulted in 
a 99-98 victory and an NBA championship on a last-gasp, game-winning 
three-pointer by John Paxson. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen had a chance for heroics on Sunday, but his shot from the 
corner missed badly as time expired, and the Phoenix Suns held on to defeat the 
Bulls, 89-88. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bulls are for real, there's no doubt about that," Phoenix Coach Paul 
Westphal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson, who sat out 15 of the last 16 games because of a lower-leg 
injury, led the Suns with 22 points and made sure Steve Kerr didn't make a 
three-point shot to tie the score. With three seconds to play and the Suns 
leading, 89-86, Johnson tackled Kerr around the neck, knocking him to the 
floor. After a timeout, Kerr made both free throws, and the Bulls got the ball 
back because of Johnson's flagrant foul, leading to Pippen's desperation shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who told Paxson before the Bulls inbounded the ball, "I'm not leaving 
you for anything," said Kerr should have won an Academy Award for writhing in 
pain after the takedown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He grabbed my face and pulled my neck back," Kerr responded. "If I get an 
Academy Award for that, fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen claimed Dan Majerle fouled him at the end, although nothing was called. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw the shot. What do you think?" Pippen asked. "We were playing hard, 
competitive basketball and playing to win, but a foul is a foul." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen had 26 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 106, Washington 84 -- The Warriors held the Bullets to seven 
points in the fourth quarter at Landover, Md., and got 26 points and 12 
rebounds from Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing in the third quarter, 73-61, the Warriors outscored the Bullets, 
45-11, the rest of way, winning for the ninth time this season after overcoming 
a double-digit deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 95, Orlando 77 -- Patrick Ewing scored 32 points against fellow 
All-Star Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Oakley grabbed 21 rebounds to lead the 
Knicks at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 104, New Jersey 102 -- David Robinson, who had 36 points and 12 
rebounds, made two free throws and knocked away an inbounds pass in the closing 
seconds of overtime at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Spurs extended their 
winning streak to seven games.  
</P>
<P>
 Houston 101, Minnesota 90 -- Mario Elie scored 17 points in only his fifth 
start of the season and Hakeem Olajuwon added 25 points and 17 rebounds as the 
Rockets overcame six technical fouls at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 99, Dallas 89 -- LaPhonso Ellis scored 21 points and Rodney Rogers came 
off the bench for 20 to lead the Nuggets over the Mavericks at Denver. Dallas 
shot only 34% from the field.

NHL ROUNDUP; KRON STARS FOR WHALERS AGAINST HIS FORMER TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Kron of the Hartford Whalers scored the two deciding goals against his 
former team, the Vancouver Canucks, in a 4-2 victory Sunday at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Kron broke a 2-2 tie when he poked in an unassisted goal at 11:33 of the third 
period from a knot of players in front of the Vancouver net. 
</P>
<P>
 Kron added his 17th of the season into an empty net with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as great as it can get, to get on the scoring sheet against your 
former team," Kron said after his first goals in 11 games. "I got lucky, but I 
think I work for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks traded Kron to the Whalers last March for Murray Craven. Jim 
Sandlak also went to Hartford later to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven has nine goals for Vancouver this season, while Kron and Sandlak have 
combined for 23 Hartford goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 3, Boston 0 -- Goaltender Mark Fitzpatrick turned away 38 shots as the 
Panthers beat the Bruins at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick, filling in for an injured John Vanbiesbrouck, turned away 30 
shots in the first two periods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers are 7-2-2 in their last 11 games. Fitzpatrick is 6-1-1 in his 
last eight and provided Florida with its first home shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton 5, Winnipeg 2 -- Jason Arnott, a rookie of the year candidate, scored 
twice and assisted on another goal to lead the Oilers over the Jets at 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 His second goal of the game gave him 20 and put the game out of reach for the 
Jets, who are now just three points ahead of the Oilers in the Western 
Conference standings with 41. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 7, Dallas 1 -- Rob Gaudreau scored three goals and Jim Waite stopped 
35 shots as the Sharks won at Dallas. The Sharks won for the 18th time to set a 
club record. They won 17 in their first season, and last season won 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks continued their recent road success (5-2-2 in their last nine 
games) as Gaudreau's second goal of the game snapped a 1-1 second-period tie 
and triggered a run of six goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The hat trick was the third of Gaudreau's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 4, New York Islanders 1 -- Buffalo center Dale Hawerchuk, playing in 
his 1,001st game, scored a pair of power-play goals to lead the Sabres at 
Buffalo. With 23 goals this season, Hawerchuk is approaching the 31 he scored 
in his first Buffalo season three years ago. He only had 16 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kurvers scored with 6:09 left to ruin Sabre goaltender Dominik Hasek's 
shutout bid.

TITANS CAPITALIZE ON ARIZONA'S WILDNESS IN 5-2 VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton took advantage of Arizona's wild pitching staff in a 5-2 
nonconference baseball victory Sunday at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Arizona pitchers combined to walk 10 batters, four of whom scored, and 
had six wild pitches.Mike Schiefelbein (0-2) walked five and threw four wild 
pitches in 2 2/3 innings to take the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, getting few good pitches, had five hits, but three of those came 
in the three-run seventh. Brian King had a one-out home run, Bret Hemphill 
added an RBI double and Adam Miian had an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a lot of walks (early)," Cal State Fullerton Coach Augie Garrido said. 
"And typically that distracts from the hitter's aggressiveness . . . We made 
some nice adjustments later in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (6-1) took a 2-0 lead in the third. King and Jeff Ferguson walked 
with one out. The runners moved up on a wild pitch. King scored on an RBI 
groundout by Jim Betzsold and Ferguson scored on an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Ricabal (1-0) held Arizona in check, allowing two unearned runs and three 
hits in 7 1/3 innings. He walked four and struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Kotsay replaced Ricabal and struck out the only batter he faced. Ted 
Silva worked the final 1 1/3 innings for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave Fullerton, which has won five in a row, a sweep of the 
three-game series with Arizona (1-5). STEVE KRESAL

RUNNING / LONG BEACH MARATHON; RAMIREZ WINS EASILY; BOWMAN LEARNS LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jose Ramirez won the 13th Long Beach marathon Sunday in 2 hours 17 minutes 25 
seconds, and Kathy Bowman won the women's division in 2:46:32. 
</P>
<P>
 Each won $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first marathon victory in the United States for Ramirez, 30, of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Klausler, 31, of Switzerland overtook Sam Rotich with less than two 
miles to go and finished second in 2:25:49. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotich, 36, of Albuquerque, N.M., finished 59 seconds later to place third 
after finishing second the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez took the lead at the three-mile mark and was never challenged. He said 
he was using the race as a tool to try to whittle his time down to 2:14 and to 
practice for the Boston marathon.  
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, wobbling on rubbery legs moments after finishing, acknowledged that 
she had attempted a crazy stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, 32, of Bellingham, Wash., finished sixth in the Walt Disney World 
marathon three weeks ago in Florida. Many would consider running two marathons 
so close together unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was kind of an off-the-wall move to see just what the heck I might be 
able to do," Bowman said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last thing I would recommend to anybody. It's pretty stupid, really, 
but sometimes we marathoners are kind of crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Schmidt, 37, of Reno, was second in 2:48:14. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Knaub, 38, of Long Beach decided on Saturday night to enter the wheelchair 
division on Sunday and won it in 1:37:30, breaking his own 1991 course record 
by 1:17. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Knaub's eighth victory in the event and he won $500. He also has won 
three L.A. marathons and five Boston marathons. 
</P>
<P>
 De Anna Sodoma, 26, of Carlsbad was the only female wheelchair competitor, and 
her time of 1:51:58 broke the course record, which she set last year, by 5:12.

 The amphitheater will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 A promise of foul weather delayed the christening of Pacific Symphony 
philanthropist Mark Johnson's 300-seat amphitheater on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed party plan for 80 guests: a buffet supper and piano recital by 
French Canadian pianist Alain Lefevre played out al fresco on Johnson's 
sprawling grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, patrons of the Pacific Symphony Orchestra heard Lefevre play Chopin's 
Grand Polonaise (and then, "My Funny Valentine") next to a dancing fire in the 
commodious living room of Johnson's new 8,000-square-foot Santa Ana mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have preferred the recital in the amphitheater -- it would have been 
so dramatic," said Johnson, who welcomed guests with aspiring actress Sandra 
Cameron, stunning in a lipstick-red Chanel, on his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someday," Johnson said, looking out a window, "I hope to have Michael 
Crawford sing in my amphitheater. Can't you just see him performing selections 
from 'The Phantom of the Opera' out there?" (Indeed. The amphitheater, which is 
carved into a gentle green slope, is topped with a fountain, divided by a 
gushing stream and surrounded by sky-scraping trees studded with 
twinkle-lights.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, guests who'd come to celebrate the symphony's recording that day of 
American composer John Corigliano's Piano Concerto -- played by Lefevre -- kept 
busy congratulating conductor Carl St.Clair on his first recording with the 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair was ecstatic. "It's music's gift to feel this exhilarated after a 
performance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Michael Fine, vice president of Koch International (the recording company 
for the orchestra's new CD): "This concerto is one of the most important of the 
century and one of the most difficult -- a killer. It is an extremely brave and 
worthy accomplishment for the orchestra to have recorded it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so pure," said Sharon Jaquith, one of a handful of symphony supporters 
invited to attend the recording session in Segerstrom Hall. "Michael Fine says 
it will probably win a Grammy Award." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one problem with the recording, Fine noted. "We had a light bulb explode 
on the downbeat," he said. "There was glass all over the floor. It didn't hurt 
anybody, but there was some tension." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who donated $50,000 to the symphony to help defray recording costs of 
about $100,000, said it was eerie to sit in Segerstrom Hall with only a few 
people. "There we were, in the back of the orchestra, all by ourselves," he 
said. "So quiet. So dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefevre was happy to be at the party. "Are you ready for some wild people in 
your house?" he asked Johnson. "I am very happy that the recording is finished. 
It was a very big job, one of the most difficult concertos I have ever 
practiced. It took me 14 months to prepare for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefevre, 31, attended the bash with his wife of 11 years, Johanne Martineau, a 
lawyer. "We met in Montreal -- lived near each other. One day, she listened to 
me working and we met each other. Ours is one of those big love stories," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When guests weren't schmoozing, they were feasting on a buffet of filet 
mignon, gravlax marinated in tequila and scampi or diving into an array of mini 
desserts that included chocolate cheesecake, fruit tarts and almond pralines 
dipped in white chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Among guests were Lefevre's agent Lily Sarfati, who came from Paris. "Alain is 
a big talent," she said. "He will go very far and very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Observed Louis Spisto, the orchestra's executive director: "This recording is 
a landmark event for the orchestra, a very challenging tour de force that most 
orchestras would never attempt for a first recording with a new music director. 
It's all about our becoming internationally recognized. That's our goal." The 
CD will be released in June.  
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests: Frank Ticheli of Pasadena, the orchestra's 
composer-in-residence (whose compositions, "Postcard" and "Radiant Voices" will 
also be featured on the CD. "Forget the romanticized version of how a composer 
composes," he said during the cocktail reception, "it's all about sitting down 
at the desk . . . long, grueling, often lonely, painful work."); Tom and Anne 
Key; Arlene and George Cheng; Paula Lingelbach; Mickey Shaw; Maralou and Jerry 
Harrington; Zee Allred; Richard and Jolene Engel; Peter and Mary Muth; and Ron 
and Joyce Hanson.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'POWER PLAY': A LOOK AT HOT SPORTS SHOTS OFF THE COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You'd assume that a sports program titled "Power Plays" would be about Tonya 
Harding. After all, what other power monger would the United States care about? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it's the behind-the-scenes choreography of the sports business that 
is examined in this fascinating, three-part documentary on PBS. "Power Plays" 
airs from 9 to 11 tonight, Tuesday and Wednesday on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, and from 8 to 10 on KVCR-TV Channel 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering a sideways scan of American culture, producer Nicholas Kent ("Naked 
Hollywood: Money, Power and the Movies") and directors Nick Read and Anand 
Tucker repeatedly emphasize that the United States is not only obsessed with 
sports but also (as Harding and Nancy Kerrigan can now testify) with sports 
celebrities. And that laser-like obsession nourishes the sprawling sports 
industries for which even millionaire athletes ultimately toil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Power Plays" ranges from tonight's Michael Jordan entree to Wednesday's look 
at the abutting Tom Landry and Jimmy Johnson eras of the Super Bowl champion 
Dallas Cowboys, along with the slick marketing schemes of pro basketball and 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Each segment contrasts power wielders and power seekers. More arresting 
tonight than the Jordan piece is a comparison of the glamour-domed universe of 
heavyweight champ Evander Hollyfield, seen fighting Larry Holmes for $18.5 
million in Las Vegas, with the low-budget combat of dreadlocked Shannon Briggs, 
a green but promising heavyweight who gets $500 for dropping a stiff a few 
seconds into the first round. Backing Hollyfield is the Duva family, a premiere 
management team. Managing Briggs is the lesser-regarded Michael Marley. 
</P>
<P>
 In a system that bloodies everyone, the strategy for young fighters is to 
build wins even if it means recruiting barely breathing setups as opponents. 
"We do plunder a few graveyards here or there," Marley admits. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, "Power Plays" juxtaposes controversial Marge Schott and her 
Cincinnati Reds with minor leaguers in Salt Lake City and makes Chicago's old 
Comiskey Park a nostalgic metaphor for baseball's simpler age. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also an even livelier section on sports agents, focusing largely on 
David Levine, a charming, 30ish go-getter whose prospects for getting his 
collegiate football client a multimillion-dollar deal with the pros light him 
up like a kid at a video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets grimier, though -- witness an incident with notorious agent Norby 
Walters involving alleged mob ties and police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What "Power Plays" all but omits, curiously, is the media's incestuously 
symbiotic link to big-time sports, at once building it up and tearing it down. 
As with politicians, actors and other non-sports celebrities, the coverage can 
get pretty ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it's Harding and everyone who has known her in her lifetime (Ralph 
Edwards, eat your heart out) who now leads U.S. newscasts. After spinning 
anecdotes and tall tales, they await the inevitable question, the one being 
asked infinitum.

<P>
 Should Tonya Harding be able to compete in the Winter Games?  
</P>
<P>
 Everyone must have an opinion. It's positively un-American not to have an 
opinion. Everything else in the world is on hold until we get this thing 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this story have steroid legs or what? Like a ticker tape that won't stop, 
the daily, hourly updates just keep coming: She'll be indicted this morning. 
This afternoon. Tomorrow. Sometime this week. This month. This millennium. 
Reportedly. Maybe. Sources say. Sources hint. Alleged sources allegedly hint. 
The people have a right to know, so break out the headline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Harding may or may not be indicted.  
</P>
<P>
 Then last week came the home video, the damaging home video, footage of 
Harding hamming it up with a friend, charging the camera like some maniac. Do 
you hear, LIKE SOME MANIAC!  
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmm. Tonya appeared carefree. She was having fun, meaning either that she's 
free of guilt or is just coldhearted. Do you hear, COLDHEARTED!  
</P>
<P>
 When running out of rumors to spin, TV reporters grunge under rocks for 
obscure angles that don't exist but need to be reported anyway. Such as asking 
athletes in other sports if they would ever consider clobbering an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the Olympic swimmer, for example, consider "knocking out" -- a euphemism 
for drowning -- an opponent? We're on the edges of our seats waiting for the 
answer. And stay tuned for the tiddly winks champ. Would he break a foe's 
knuckles? Just to win? Has winning come to this? Has it, huh? Has it? Is 
alleged hussy Tonya Harding a metaphor for the evil in sports? Will opposing 
Little Leaguers be clubbing each other with their Louisville Sluggers? 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmm. Louisville. Kentucky. The Kentucky Derby. The story is growing. Quick, 
get somebody to the bluegrass state to see if Tonya's been spotted there trying 
to fix the derby by beating up thoroughbreds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmmm. Bluegrass. Grass. Is Tonya Harding doing dope? She did look wild in 
that home video. Maybe if we hired professional sniffers, some dogs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And wait a minute! We almost missed the biggest angle of all. Has anyone 
quizzed Charlie Manson about this? Better send over a camera crew before 
Geraldo does. After all, February is a ratings sweeps month. 
</P>
<P>
 So terribly sexy is this story that just about everyone is hugging it like a 
lover. The networks broke into their midday programming last week for live 
coverage of the plea bargain by Tonya's husband and the statement of his 
lawyer. Two of the network anchors who weighed in were none other than NBC's 
Tom Brokaw and ABC's Peter Jennings, their mere presence validating the 
magnitude of the coverage. Why, we haven't seen them on a story this big since 
Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Rather was probably tied up on the Lorena Bobbitt retrospective. So, who 
should CBS dispatch to Portland for several days of Harding coverage? None 
other than schmoozy Connie Chung. The gleaming centerpiece of her steely 
reporting was Thursday night's "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung" sit-down with 
Harding's father. You braced for the brutal question you knew was coming, the 
question (gasp) she just had to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Did he think that Tonya would be disappointed if she didn't go to the Winter 
Games?  
</P>
<P>
 Bold work. Yet competitors were nipping at Chung's heels, for almost 
simultaneously on another channel, ABC's "PrimeTime Live" was doing Tonya and 
Jeff: The Courtship. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, bring on more of those pictures of Tonya Harding on the ice. The 
daily dose, the ones replacing a dancing Michael Jackson grabbing his groin. 
Each time she falls, those reporting it fall with her.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; FANS -- IF NOT CRITICS -- GET RUSH AT ARENA CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear L.A. Times, I can't believe your Jim Washburn was even at the Rush 
concert at the Anaheim Arena Saturday night. He certainly didn't see the same 
show I saw.  
</P>
<P>
 For starts, Rush is a genius, incredible band, and I'm sure they didn't 
practice so hard for years just to have some guy with a grudge and a pencil 
call them "sort of a Dog Squad version of the Police." Yes, both bands are 
trios, but Canada's Rush is so far advanced from the Police's has-been pop 
music, it isn't funny. Stewart Copeland couldn't even lift Neil Peart's 
drumsticks!  
</P>
<P>
 That's just one of many errors in the story. For example, the song before the 
inflatable rabbits came on was called "Show Don't Tell" not "Barf Magnet," as 
Mr. Washburn had it. Rush doesn't even have a song called "Barf Magnet." Nor do 
they have an instrumental called "March of the Cumbersome Twinkie Trolls." Do 
your homework! And what other band, outside of Pink Floyd, even thinks enough 
of their fans to have inflatable rabbits onstage, really big ones, not to 
mention real flames and other trippy stuff?  
</P>
<P>
 The review also said the band played "several kazillion" notes, when anyone 
paying attention could tell you they played 2,001,783 notes, each executed with 
precision and conforming to strict Canadian standards. Your reviewer, obviously 
not classically trained, can't even begin to comprehend what virtuoso-level 
players these three are. Would Geddy Lee change his bass 16 times per show if 
he didn't care? Rush rules! Sincerely, Rush fans: To save time, effort and 
stamps, why not just sign the letter above? Voila! You now have a letter of 
complaint in a real newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 As most Rush fans probably know by now, all rock critics hate Rush. We have 
to. It's in the union bylaws. If we even allow one kind word to slip through 
about the tundra-taught trio, we could face loss of benefits, such as the free 
Rush CDs the band's label sends us. That's right, for despising Rush, we get 
all their stuff for free! We use 'em for coasters around my house. 
</P>
<P>
 I must admit that there was a time in my life when I could have liked Rush. It 
was the pre-teen time, when I got my first cheap high by firing off a roll of 
caps in my Mattel Tommy Gun and inhaling the smoke. I could have really gotten 
into "2112" then, before the nausea wore off. 
</P>
<P>
 At the risk of having my future supply of coaster/CDs cut off, I have to admit 
that Rush wasn't odious Saturday. Even not counting Geddy Lee's big insect of a 
voice, the group has a distinctive sound. These guys are sort of a Dog Squad 
version of the Police: tight and propulsive, with Lee and admittedly 
techo-fabulous drummer Peart (who had a remarkable drum solo spot) laying down 
solid yet shifting foundations, and guitarist Alex Lifeson erecting structures 
of sound over them with his choppy rhythm style and chiming leads. 
</P>
<P>
 In both its music and Peart's lyrics of sci-fi visions and ruddy-faced Canuck 
Angst , Rush is a very clever band. But for me, at least without the benefit of 
cap-gun smoke, cleverness only goes so far, and one starts longing for such 
elements as emotion, intimacy and soul. Those weren't forthcoming Saturday, 
though there were those very large inflatable bunnies as well as flames, 
fireworks explosions and some very clever films. 
</P>
<P>
 Over its two-hour show, the band played a mix of old favorites and songs from 
the current "Counterparts" album. The list included "The Spirit of Radio," 
"Cold Fire," "Time Stand Still," "Roll the Bones" (overwhelmed by the 
accompanying film in which dice morph into a talking skull), "Animate," 
"Limelight," "Show Don't Tell" and "Tom Sawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Most members of the capacity audience were on their feet throughout, singing 
along, clapping, toking and acting as if they were having a tremendous time. 
Good thing we critics know better! Openers Candlebox proved to be just another 
band without a spark, cranking out the same tedious, undistinguished pap that 
has been giving hard rock a bad name for two decades. Welcome aboard! 
</P>
<P>
 This was the Anaheim Arena's first time hosting hard-rock, and it wasn't any 
great delight. Shall we start with security? Along with intrusive though not 
necessarily effective body frisks, guards required many concert-goers to empty 
out their pockets, a demeaning way to treat people who are supposed to be your 
guests. Not that the security person using the f-word to address people in line 
set a better example. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the tight spacing between rows leaves little room for serious air 
guitar or other displays of rocking out . The sky boxes that ring the hall 
distract from the concert ambience. With their glass windows and glaring TV 
sets inside, you almost get the feeling you're in the middle of a condo complex 
instead of a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 All those hard glass surfaces also may contribute to the hall's booming, 
echoey sound which, while not quite so abominable as the L.A. Sports Arena's, 
is markedly worse than the Forum's. You might expect that the older halls would 
be the slaughterhouses of sound, as they were designed before the modern era of 
rock concerts. Such concerts have been arena staples for a quarter-century now, 
and it's surprising that a new facility would be planned with so little regard 
for acoustics.

WILLIAMS SHOWS HE ISN'T YOUR AVERAGE JOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "They call me a blues singer. I don't care what they call me as long as I can 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 So pronounced Joe Williams midway through his show Saturday night at the 
Irvine Barclay Theatre, a 20-song concert so splendid, so marked by consummate 
musicality, that one had to wonder if any type of tune is beyond his reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sublimely accompanied by Norman Simmons on piano, John Clayton on bass and 
Sherman Ferguson on drums, Williams concentrated on his three favorite grooves: 
blues (in any number of moods); slow, evocative songs of the heart, and 
mid-to-up-tempo pop standards. With an elastic tenor-baritone that seems to 
have come with a lifetime guarantee, the former Count Basie star made each 
number shine, whether it was a torrid version of "Roll 'Em Pete," a tender "A 
Child Is Born" or a thought-this-one-was-worn-out song such as "Satin Doll." 
</P>
<P>
 At 75, Williams obviously doesn't have the voice he had in the '50s and '60s, 
but it's still in awfully good shape. His middle and low range tones remain 
large and buoyant, and his high notes were never in danger Saturday of being 
called thin and brittle. Only when he really stepped on the volume, as he did 
during the second chorus of a very fast "What a Difference a Day Makes," did 
his voice turn gravelly and gruff -- and there was a good deal about that that 
was attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his ever-sophisticated approach has become even more so. He built 
his performance on two massive strengths: a propensity for tossing off lyrics 
at rhythmically dynamic points, and an ability to tell a story in a way that 
convinces you he knows what he's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 His rhythmic agility was exemplified by "Satin Doll." Johnny Mercer's lyric 
("Baby, should we go out skippin'? Careful, amigo, you're flippin' ") is 
carefree and catchy, but we've all heard it a thousand times. Williams made it 
fresh, even surprising, by singing some of the phrases riotously fast and 
stretching others out leisurely. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Right, OK, You Win" snapped and crackled, and "Goin' Down Slow" 
positively smoldered. 
</P>
<P>
 His affinity for narrative found its mark during the philosophical "Here's to 
Life," an Artie Butler-Phyllis Molinary opus, the title tune of Williams' 
latest CD. The song is about an older person who, even while looking back, 
continues to look forward; Williams delivered it simply but authoritatively. It 
easily could have been schmaltzed up with swooping increases and decreases in 
volume, but Williams just sang it straight and was immensely moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons gave an object lesson in the art of accompaniment. His overall 
approach was to support Williams with a rich and full sound, as if Williams 
were singing with an orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons would soften during the vocals and offer complementary ideas, and at 
the end of a vocal phrase, the piano would get a little louder to make a 
fittingly spirited musical comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton and Ferguson were the canny cohorts to Simmons' regimen. Whether it 
was by eye contact or just intuition, they knew what to do when.

JAZZ REVIEWS; AT OCPAC, HADEN MISSES, HARGROVE HITS; BOTH LOOK TO THE PAST FOR 
MATERIAL AND REVEAL THE DIFFERENT VISTAS A HISTORICAL VIEW CAN TAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For inspiration these days, jazz seems to look back rather than forward. 
Saturday's pairing at the Orange County Performing Arts Center of bassist 
Charlie Haden's Quartet West and trumpeter Roy Hargrove's quintet was typical 
of this hindsight, and revealed the different vistas a historical view can take 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 While thoroughly modern in its presentation, Haden's quartet (with pianist 
Alan Broadbent, saxophonist Ernie Watts and drummer Larance Marable) seeks to 
evoke the romance of bygone Los Angeles with romantic ballads, be-bop tunes and 
numbers influenced by Hollywood film noir and the writings of Raymond Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 In a set that closely followed those they played last summer at the Hyatt 
Newporter-KLON-FM Jazz at the Hyatt series (when saxophonist Bennie Maupin 
substituted for Watts) and last fall at Pasadena's Ambassador Auditorium, Haden 
and company succeeded in creating the aura of the period but failed to generate 
much excitement inside that context. 
</P>
<P>
 After opening with Charlie Parker's upbeat exercise "Passport," the group 
turned to a trio of Haden's own tunes designed to cast the gray shadows of 
black-and-white films, embellished with audible touches of art deco. The 
lyricism of "Hello My Lovely" (and as a craftsman of simple beauty, composer 
Haden has few peers) was embraced by Broadbent, who spun an unaccompanied 
introduction rich in classically detailed lines and ascending flourishes before 
moving into a warm improvisational excursion backed by bass and drums. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts' high-strung tenor statements stood, as they did all night, in energetic 
contrast to Broadbent's lush, relaxed sound. The saxophonist mixed sheets 
tightly packed 16th notes with exclamatory squeals and pointed, high-end bursts 
that brought an edge to the Chandler-inspired number. This contrast in 
personalities -- Broadbent's romance and Watts' on-the-edge rants -- is one of 
the quartet's strongest features. 
</P>
<P>
 During Haden's Latin-flavored romp "Child's Play," drummer Marable proved once 
again that he is a master of shade and color, coaxing a galaxy of sound from 
his three cymbals while working strongly on the beat with snare and tom-toms. 
At one point he generated a pair of deep pitches from his single bass drum, 
creating a call-and-response exchange perfect in its simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden -- set far back from the rest of the group, behind tall plastic shields 
designed to protect his hearing -- soloed less frequently than in previous 
performances, and to less advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 His usual folk-song-based improvisations, though melodic as ever, seemed 
uninspired, and during the solo on his signature "First Song," he plodded 
heavily behind the beat. But his walking pace in accompaniment was, as always, 
firm, active and filled with imaginative twists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening set, trumpeter Hargrove's quintet concentrated on the post-bop 
heydays of the '60s, bringing all the drive and excitement of the period but a 
thoroughly modern improvisational stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove, who looks to the entire history of jazz for fodder, avoided too wide 
a view here, foregoing New Orleans-influenced material of the type he aired 
last summer at the Playboy Jazz Festival. The narrower focus paid off in high 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Re-creating the classic Blue Note period blend of trumpet and sax with tenor 
player Ron Blake, Hargrove's own material added quirks and twists to the 
tradition of Lee Morgan, Hank Mobley, Kenny Dorham and Horace Silver. 
</P>
<P>
 During his new "Soppin' the Biscuit," a paean to the jazz-funk tradition 
established by pianist Silver, Hargrove took full advantage of the infectious 
rhythm with hard-bop lines that threatened to take the roof off staid 
Segerstrom Hall. His attack was insistent and pointed in the style of 
'60s-edition Miles Davis but was delivered with a strength and polish that 
Davis eschewed. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed his warm side playing fluegelhorn on "Once Forgotten" by Pamela 
Watson (wife of saxophonist Bobby Watson), a thoughtful ballad that moved to a 
rhythmic sashay. Hargrove's strongest statement on fluegel came during "Never 
Let Me Go" when he explored the standard's melody in an unaccompanied 
introduction. The number also found bassist Rodney Whitaker -- a standout 
throughout the performance -- using his bow to hone melodic phrases that barely 
touched at the familiar theme. 
</P>
<P>
 While Haden's group emphasized individual performers, Hargrove's quintet 
looked to interplay for its strength. Bassist Whitaker and drummer Gregory 
Hutchinson seemed particularly attuned, echoing each other's lines while 
buttressing the work of the horns. Pianist Peter Martin shone both in 
accompaniment and while improvising. His sinister left-hand boogie during "The 
Biscuit" made for one of the evening's most intense moments.

 NEA's Earthquake Plan: The National Endowment for the Arts, which offered 
emergency funds to Los Angeles for arts recovery after the 1992 Los Angeles 
riots, will not provide similar funding in response to the Northridge 
earthquake -- but will offer a significant break to area artists by waiving 
"all or part of" matching grant requirements and providing time extensions for 
project completion. Ordinarily, artists and organizations receiving NEA funds 
must raise matching funds of at least $1 for every federal dollar awarded. The 
NEA has notified all grantees potentially affected by the quake telling them to 
contact their program supervisors for details. MOVIES

 Aced It: Warner Bros.' new comedy "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," starring Jim 
Carrey as a finder of missing mammals, found its way to the No. 1 spot at the 
box office during the weekend with a $12-million gross, according to early 
industry estimates. There was quite a drop to No. 2: 20th Century Fox's "Mrs. 
Doubtfire" took in $6.8 million, followed by TriStar's "Philadelphia" with $5.7 
million. Touchstone Pictures' newcomer "My Father, the Hero," starring Gerard 
Depardieu, was fourth with $5.5 million. Universal's "Schindler's List," still 
in limited release, was fifth with $5 million. And Columbia's "I'll Do 
Anything," the much-talked-about comedy from James L. Brooks, didn't do that 
much at the box office in its first weekend in release, grossing $4.8 million.

 A Lift From Lilith: Lilith's visit did wonders for "Frasier." Last week's 
episode of the NBC show, which featured a reunion between Frasier Crane (Kelsey 
Grammer) and his ex-wife from his "Cheers" days, played by Bebe Neuwirth, 
received the show's highest ratings ever, a 21.8 (each point is equal to 
942,000 homes). The show was No. 1 in its Thursday, 9:30 p.m. time period. 
Also, the show rated higher than "Seinfeld," which precedes it on NBC, for the 
first time.

 Lotsa Suds: "Days of Our Lives" cleaned up at the Soap Opera Digest Awards, 
winning awards for favorite show and hottest female and male stars, Melissa 
Reeves and Drake Hogestyn. CBS' "The Young and the Restless" took three awards, 
including Jess Walton as best lead actress. For NBC's "Days," Robert 
Kelker-Kelly won as best lead actor and Lisa Rinna and Patrick Muldoon were 
named best female and male newcomers. Winners were decided in a readers poll 
conducted by Soap Opera Digest. "Frasier's" Kelsey Grammer co-hosted the show, 
broadcast live Friday night on NBC from the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

 First American Winners: TNT's TV movie "Geronimo" swept the second annual 
First American Awards, which recognize Native American performers. The telefilm 
won five awards, including best actor for Joseph Runningfox, best actress for 
Tailihn Forest Flower and a special humanitarian award. Another Geronimo story, 
Columbia Pictures' feature film "Geronimo, An American Legend," also gathered 
accolades -- including best actor in a movie for Wes Studi. Best actor in a TV 
series went to Larry Sellars for CBS' "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," and CBS' 
"Northern Exposure" was honored with the Trustee Award for continued excellence 
in portraying Native Americans. The awards, sponsored by the group First 
Americans in the Arts, will be given out Saturday at the Doubletree Inn in

Jackson's publicist Lee Solters said Denver was "not on his schedule." But 
Jackson's lawyer will be there, as will Crystal Cartier, who says she wrote her 
"Dangerous" nine years ago. The U.S. District Court trial will decide Cartier's

Feb. 28, not Feb. 21 as was previously reported, as a guest on NBC's "Late 
Night With Conan O'Brien." . . . Next up at the Westwood Playhouse: "Laughing

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; ST. MARTIN TURNS LOOSE HIGH SPIRITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armand St. Martin's business card makes an appealingly simple representation: 
"New Orleans Rock 'n' Roll." What the pianist-singer had to offer at his 10th 
annual Mardi Gras party at the Alligator Lounge on Friday, however, was a bit 
more expansive, with a parade, Mardi Gras beads and nonstop entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a friendly atmosphere, high spirits and plenty of dancing rhythms are 
what St. Martin's gigs are really all about. Although most of St. Martin's 
songs were originals, the overflow crowd appeared to be less concerned with the 
tunes' undemanding lyrics than with the danceability of the rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Fronting the Creole Liberation Front, a five-piece band, with two backup 
singers, St. Martin romped easily across a range of styles, from Professor 
Longhair boogie and Cajun rhythms to urban R&B and rock 'n' roll. His piano was 
enthusiastic, if not quite on a par with his better-known New Orleans 
contemporaries. His singing sometimes verged dangerously close to Elvis Presley 
parody, but in its most attractive moments had a strong roots quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all was the undefinable way in which St. Martin connected with his 
audience. Not especially gregarious, addicted to corny jokes and personal 
asides, he nonetheless managed to produce spirited crowd responses.DON HECKMAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; PIANIST ASHKENAZY PLAYS AT PAVILION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vladimir Ashkenazy may not have deeply moved every last one of his listeners 
Saturday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, but that certainly wasn't his 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is to say that everything seemed to go according to plans for the 
56-year-old Russian/Icelandic pianist. And thoroughly considered, profound 
plans they were, delivered with patrician subtlety and authoritative technique. 
</P>
<P>
 His Beethoven/Prokofiev recital unfolded with impressive logic, in a large 
curve of thought. He gave each step along the way its due and nothing more and 
did so with not a jot of self-consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two sonatas of Beethoven's Opus 31 served as the first half of his 
program. Ashkenazy took the high road to Classical restraint with both of them, 
and they unfolded with unfussy clarity and crisp rhythm, their details, quirks 
and dramas painted in quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't seem to find the first movement of the G-major Sonata especially 
witty, nor the grazioso second particularly resplendent, but what he did find 
-- rhythmic play and elegant tapestry, respectively -- proved equally valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the D-minor "Tempest" Sonata has revealed greater pathos than this 
performance did, but Ashkenazy replaced it with a pointed forcefulness, 
applying color and nuance only where they made structural sense. Though the 
tempos sounded carefully calibrated to each other, the scheme wasn't 
straitjacketed; it unwound gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Two episodes from Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet" -- "Love Scene and Farewell" 
and "Masques" -- provided a fragile, melodious (Ashkenazy avoided all luxury 
here) introduction to the same composer's formidable Eighth Sonata, which 
followed after a brief pause. 
</P>
<P>
 This he played with engrossing concentration, its spaciousness and thunder 
emerging with elegance and unforced rhetoric. He revealed the score's 
complications -- rhythmic crosscurrents, terraced dynamics, stratified tempos 
-- without calling attention to himself. Even the vivacity and virtuosity in 
the finale sounded efficient (though spirited) rather than self-regarding. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all extremely well done, thought-provoking and admirable. TIMOTHY 
MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; L.B. SYMPHONY ON SPANISH-LATIN TACK

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Long Beach Symphony convened on Saturday at the Terrace Theater, 
there was a clear, theme-driven agenda at hand, and a relatively venturesome 
one at that. All night, nary a German and/or 19th-Century work impeded on this 
little festival of Spanish and Latin-American music. That alone warrants kudos. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that esoterica was not the thrust of conductor JoAnn 
Falletta's program. Bolstered by the popular concert standbys of Joaquin 
Rodrigo's "Concierto de Aranjuez" and Manuel de Falla's Second Suite from "El 
Sombrero de Tres Picos," the program also gave exposure to the work of 
lesser-known Latin American composers. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine Alberto Ginastera's "Variaciones concertantes" is a moody mosaic of 
12 parts. Languid harp-and-cello duets lead to driving folk dance-like 
cadences, with hints of tonality being pushed to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist David Tannenbaum attended to Rodrigo's concerto with the assurance 
and passion of one who has known the piece intimately, but is still in love. 
Never mind the more boisterous outer sections, it is the Adagio -- the picture 
of exquisite sadness -- that lingers deepest in the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's unsung iconoclast, Silvestre Revueltas combined indigenous folk 
influences with striking orchestral ideas, as in "Sensemaya." Its bold, brassy 
assertions over a hypnotic 7/8 rhythm were delivered crisp and steamy by an 
orchestra with expanded percussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Astor Piazzolla, who died in 1992, was widely deemed the king of the "nuevo 
tango," reinvigorating tango traditions with modern ideas. It was only late in 
his life that his aspirations as a serious composer began to find fruition, as 
with his 1988 "Tangazo." Here, seductive mood swings range from quiet legato 
intensity to fervent, even comical gusto. 
</P>
<P>
 Gusto prevailed as Falla's celebratory splash closed a concert whose quotient 
of exotica was in direct correlation to the rarity of hearing this music in the 
concert hall.JOSEF WOODARD

A GREAT REASON TO HANG OUT AT THE MALL; INNOVATIVE PUBLIC SCHOOL IS PLANNED 
WITHIN A SANTA ANA SHOPPING AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Californians may not be packed in like sardines yet, despite the 
region's increasing urbanization, but schools definitely are feeling a squeeze. 
Many cities are experiencing substantial increases among their populations of 
young adults, and that means ever-growing numbers of children who need seats in 
schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Typically, children are crowded into existing buildings and portable buildings 
start popping up on campuses when money for new facilities is tight. Now, with 
a plan for a first-ever "space-saver" school in Santa Ana, the state is seeking 
to take an innovative approach to urban public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than sprawling for a block or more in a residential neighborhood, the 
school would occupy a yet-to-be-built three-story structure that would house a 
parking garage on the ground floor and classrooms for 1,300 intermediate-grade 
students on the two floors above. 
</P>
<P>
 The location, too, is unusual: a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature, which promised to fund the program from bond measures, 
recommended that urban school districts build new facilities next to or atop 
underutilized commercial or industrial buildings to avoid condemning property 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Urbanized Santa Ana is an ideal place to launch the project. School board 
members say they could use 10 new schools right now, and they expect enrollment 
to rise even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Such imaginative approaches to neighborhood schools are needed throughout the 
region. For example, when damage from the Northridge earthquake forced Los 
Angeles campuses to close, LEARN (the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for 
Restructuring Now) wisely began an effort to take advantage of vacant 
commercial spaces nearby and convert empty offices into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the Santa Ana effort are questions from some neighbors of the Bristol 
Market Place mall, where the 98,000-square-foot campus would be built. They 
worry about traffic, parking and crime problems that might arise from a new 
school. We hope that the proposal will not be done in by nothing more than "Not 
In My Back Yard" resistance. Santa Ana ought to have an opportunity to try this 
promising approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has earmarked $23 million to buy the Santa Ana property and has 
promised $20 million more to build the school and recreational facilities. At a 
time when funds are scarce in Sacramento, Santa Ana is in line for a windfall 
that promises to be a useful model for other districts.

MENENDEZ MISTRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wow! What a beautiful example of just how weak and out of order is our justice 
system. Hung juries in both of the Menendez brothers' cases. We now hear that 
legal fees (i.e., pay to attorneys) have eaten up all the family estate and 
that now any additional legal fees will have to be picked up by us -- the 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's OK. Just listen to the quote from Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, "Be 
damned with how much money it's going to cost," we will try them again. The 
inefficiency and incompetence of the district attorney coupled with a judicial 
system staffed by judges who were and are attorneys and seem to delight in 
seeing attorneys become wealthy have given us trials of absurd length with huge 
fees to the attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 We need no-fault insurance, strict but reasonable limits on malpractice 
settlements and -- most of all -- a court system that can quickly and 
efficiently dispense justice without all the needless delays. Democracy depends 
on a fair, functioning judicial system. We are rapidly losing ours. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM C. THOMAS

</P>
<P>
 Garcetti and his staff seem to be in a slump these days. He can't get a 
conviction to save his life or maybe his job for that matter. He claims he 
needs more money for his budget, but he can't get a conviction with the 
manpower he has now. 
</P>
<P>
 What I feel brings this issue to a head is the outcome of the Menendez 
brothers' trials. Here we have, for all practical purposes, an open and shut 
case of two adult sons shotgunning their parents to death. The district 
attorney's office is supposed to speak in behalf of the dead parents. But they 
were cheated by the incompetence of the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 How much longer as taxpayers and residents of this county are we going to put 
up with the performances of our public servants who, if it were not for plea 
bargaining, wouldn't get any convictions at all? 
</P>

trial comes up next? They surely won't be fired.

 Re "Jurors' Rift Emerged Early and Ran Deep," Jan. 29: 
</P>
<P>
 What is to become of us as a society when we have juries that cannot convict 
murderers because they feel sorry for them? Those jurors who could not find it 
in their hearts to condemn the Menendez brothers have no common sense or they 
left it at home. There probably aren't any murderers past or present (e.g., 
Hitler et al.) who don't have a childhood history to explain why they did the 
terrible things they did. How are we to find juries that know the difference 
between understanding despicable behavior without excusing it?

</P>
<P>
 Am I the only one outraged to see the smirking, smiling Lyle Menendez on your 
front page (Jan 29). Please, no more of that. Is murder justified in the 
killing of, not one, but two parents? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSE RUBALCABA 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I absolutely concur with your Jan. 31 editorial that doing justice in the 
Menendez retrial is essential. The facts must determine Garcetti's pursuit of 
authentic justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond reasonable doubt, intent was motivated by pure fear and self-defense, 
not murder-one. The lives of appendage trophies (to be used, not loved) are 
vulnerable to extermination should exposure of sick secrets threaten a 
psychopathic father and self-obsessed mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle and Eric (a classic victim) tried to be good sons and decent persons. 
They respected their parents' wishes, tried to please them, and looked up to 
Jose's successful attributes (which he perverted into cruelty and unethical 
avenues). 
</P>
<P>
 Murder-one prosecution, erroneously based, wastes "nickels and dimes" and 
ignores the true facts of the case, which will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 CAROL CORRIGAN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't anyone in this town understand the concepts of "reasonable doubt" and 
"burden of proof"? I voted for voluntary manslaughter in the case of People vs. 
Erik Menendez because the prosecution failed to prove that Erik is guilty of 
first-degree murder, not because I am "so enamored with Abramson and her 
argument," as Alan Abrahamson wrote (news analysis, Jan. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 If this is the kind of reporting your readers have been relying on these past 
six months, I doubt there is an unbiased potential juror left in the whole 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Has anyone bothered to notice that no one on the Erik Menendez jury voted for 
involuntary manslaughter, much less acquittal? I don't call up to 11 years in 
prison for each count of manslaughter "getting away with it."

FREEWAY CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No added sales tax, please. The last temporary quarter-cent sales tax turned 
out to be a permanent tax. If we need to raise $700 million to get the 
earthquake grant, let us do it in a temporary and common sense way.Charge $1 
per vehicle on cars entering the freeways; that will cost $10 per week to 
drivers needing to use freeways. It will keep off ones that can use other means 
of travel. Do this until the needed $700 million is paid off, then remove the 
tax. What needs caution is to avoid the greedy officials wanting to continue 
the tax after the needed amount is paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 This will have several advantages; it will be a temporary tax, it will thin 
out traffic and it will allow quicker repair of broken freeways.

GRAND OLD PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the last of a long line of Yankee Republicans, I must unhappily concede 
that I no longer know what my party stands for. Pat Buchanan's dreary Column 
Right (Feb. 1), so typical of the voices now speaking for what truly used to be 
the Grand Old Party, is revealingly silent on how to make America better or 
improve the quality of life, but never lacking on ways to create issues to 
retake territory for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Republican Party lurches inexorably rightward on the way toward 
trivializing itself out of existence, one can't help but be struck by the 
realization that those who now control the party increasingly see and define 
the world in their own cataclysmic biblical terms. Small wonder that it is 
becoming increasingly incapable of addressing real problems in a real world 
with practical solutions.

THE UNIVERSITY OF HIGHER TREMORS; CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY COPED WITH 
STATEWIDE STANDARDS AND LIMITED RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How much earthquake protection is enough for the California State University 
system? How much can the state afford to provide? What is a reasonable 
expectation for protecting the public safety even if it means sustaining heavy 
property damage? 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere among (1) the incredible competing pressures on higher education 
brought on by California's ongoing state of fiscal crisis, (2) the earthquake 
safety standards imposed by state law and (3) the whims of Mother Nature lies 
the art of the possible for campuses in earthquake-prone Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 When the earth moves, all bets are off and we find out not only whether what 
we have in place is a good plan but whether it is a good enough one. Such is 
the mighty power of an earthquake; it is not only an equalizer in its 
infliction of damage on one and all, it is a leveler of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 We learn, as in the case of the campus of Cal State Northridge, not so much 
what we would like by way of protection but what we can get away with in view 
of the competing demands on the public coffers.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month's earthquake clarified things in precisely that way. It was 
terrible that a parking lot crumpled, that a complex of faculty offices and 
classrooms and much more were so damaged and that fires broke out in science 
buildings. Campus life will not be quite the same; people no doubt are going to 
have a very uncomfortable time living through the aftermath. The estimate of 
damage has climbed into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 But considering the proximity of the earthquake, things might have been much 
worse, with extensive injuries and deaths. In that sense, the strategy of the 
Cal State system to minimize and control damage could be judged something of a 
success, considering after all that the CSUN campus virtually took a direct 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State system is not subject to the same state provisions as 
kindergarten-through-12th-grade schools under state law, but it is fully 
responsible for meeting earthquake safety standards under the California 
administrative code, and it complies with any additions to the state Uniform 
Building Code on seismic safety. It is hard to fault the system for resistance; 
the problem is money. Past reviews have shown that at Cal State Fullerton, for 
example, several key buildings awaiting reinforcement are determined to be 
"poor" or "very poor" risks for earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Life now will resume at the damaged CSUN campus and go on at the other 
nerve-rattled Cal State campuses in this area. The disaster has shown how much 
work remains to be done. It is an indication, too, that however serious the 
damage is, it is no small thing for a university community to be able to pick 
up the pieces and carry on.

NORTH KOREA PLAYS A DANGEROUS GAME; NUCLEAR ISSUE WON'T -- AND SHOULDN'T -- GO 
AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The International Atomic Energy Agency's program to monitor North Korea's 
nuclear facilities has gone blind. The automatic cameras and other surveillance 
devices the IAEA has at North Korea's identified nuclear-related sites are out 
of film and batteries, and maintenance of the equipment is prevented by 
Pyongyang's refusal to allow the IAEA unrestricted access to other suspected 
nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary William J. Perry warns that a 
"very big stick" may soon have to be used to force North Korea's compliance 
with international nuclear rules. The unmistakable smell of a brewing crisis is 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 21 the IAEA board of directors will hear a report from its specialists 
and then be asked to consider whether North Korea has cheated on its 
obligations under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, whether in other words 
it is embarked on a secret program to build nuclear weapons. American 
intelligence agencies, admittedly handicapped by trying to determine what has 
been going on in the world's most closed society, believe that it has. High 
U.S. officials think that North Korea may already have put together at least 
one nuclear device. The critical need now, Perry said at his confirmation 
hearing last week, is to keep that one from becoming dozens. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAEA could and almost certainly will ask the U.N. Security Council to 
impose economic sanctions against North Korea to get it to comply with the 
treaty. The success of any sanctions will depend foremost on China's 
cooperation. If China joins in denying its neighbor such strategic materials as 
oil, North Korea's already enfeebled economy will be weakened still more. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry suggested that enlisting Beijing's help is more urgent right now than 
putting pressure on it to improve human rights. That thought, floated just one 
day after the Clinton Administration took a tough line on human rights abuses 
in China, seemed to signal a readiness to ease up on pressures over human 
rights in exchange for China's help in bringing Pyongyang into line. Hypocrisy? 
Maybe, but also a sure indication of how great a worry North Korea's nuclear 
program has become. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a mistake, however, to regard all this as just another chapter in 
the nearly half-century-long history of U.S.-North Korean animosity. North 
Korea's deviousness and recalcitrance on the pro- duction of nuclear weapons 
represent instead a fundamental challenge to the international order. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake are the integrity and in fact the survival of the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty, the only effective global program for limiting the 
spread of nuclear weapons. If Pyongyang successfully defies the IAEA and drops 
out of the treaty, it's almost certain that other countries -- Iran, for 
starters -- will follow. After that, the stampede would be on. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reasons to be concerned, as some in South Korea and Japan are, about 
the consequences of pushing Kim Il Sung's unpredictable regime too hard at this 
time. But there are reasons to fear even more doing nothing while North Korea 
proceeds apace with its nuclear plans. Pyongyang is being asked only to respect 
its international responsibilities, nothing more. It has had more than enough 
time to decide to do so.

DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FELONS AND TRUANTS; JUVENILE JUSTICE: REDESIGN THE SYSTEM 
TO DEAL WITH TODAY'S INCREASINGLY VIOLENT REALITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The juvenile justice system is failing to protect us from the surge in violent 
crimes committed by young people. 
</P>
<P>
 The patchwork of laws put on the books over the past 30 years isn't working. 
One problem is that the system was designed to help troubled youth who 
committed minor offenses, but 75% of the current cases in juvenile court are 
felonies. We need to act immediately to replace it with a coherent program that 
protects society from violent juvenile criminals, efficiently rehabilitates 
youths who can be saved -- and also knows how to tell the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some principles that could form the core of a revision: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove many violent offenders from the juvenile system. Violent youths who 
are 17 years old should be sent directly to adult court. Last year, about 50% 
of the juveniles referred to the Probation Department for possible criminal 
offenses were 17 years old. So were many juveniles charged with the most 
serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors should have discretion to transfer even much younger juveniles 
accused of the most serious crimes to adult courts. State legislators have 
proposed lowering the age at which a youth can be tried as an adult from 16 to 
14, but the numbers matter less than letting prosecutors use their own 
judgment. For instance, a 15-year-old is currently in juvenile court, accused 
of a double murder. If the murders had occurred nine days later, on his 16th 
birthday, he could have been tried as an adult and, if convicted, sentenced to 
life without the possibility of parole. Convicted juvenile offenders must be 
freed by age 25. 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit juvenile confidentiality. Society needs to identify juveniles who 
commit serious crimes and know what happens to them in court. Improvements have 
been made over the years, but there are still instances where agencies charged 
with providing services to children are not aware of criminal proceedings 
involving a child. School officials, for instance, concerned about violating 
confidentiality laws, have often not told teachers about students who had been 
convicted of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deliver real rehabilitation. Juvenile justice has to efficiently deliver 
rehabilitative services to juveniles who commit minor offenses. The first step 
is coordination among all the agencies that assist young people at risk. We 
need to identify and help the growing number of children who have never had 
structure or hope in their lives. Government can also offer parents help with 
parenting skills and intervention before the family structure falls apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The present juvenile system puts truants and murderers through the same 
procedures, including the appointment of attorneys at public expense and long 
judicial hearings. We need laws that allow better choices between punishment 
and guidance, and that use resources more wisely. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make juveniles -- and their parents -- accountable. Punishment that fits the 
crime must be meted out fairly and with certainty. Currently, juvenile burglars 
are often sent straight home on probation while adults who commit the same 
offense get a mandatory prison sentence; this sort of thing makes juvenile 
offenders believe they can get away with almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents must be held responsible for keeping their children in school. We can 
enforce violations of the Education Code and at the same time assist parents 
with "stay in school" programs. Parents must also pay for the damage their 
children cause, including the cost of graffiti cleanups. Current law provides 
for restitution of up to $10,000 to victims of juvenile crime. New laws should 
simplify this recovery and reinforce parental responsibility, while also 
offering parenting assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intervene early to prevent violence later. This is the most important step 
we can take to stop juvenile crime. Legislators need to change the laws that 
prohibit and punish as well as provide programs and funding to give children 
the skills and motivation to stay in school and away from gangs, drugs and 
crime.  
</P>
<P>
 * Keep juveniles away from guns. We must substantially stiffen laws and 
penalties for juveniles in possession of guns and for adults who make guns 
available to juveniles. No loopholes, no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 A new juvenile justice system would quickly reduce the level of fear we all 
feel. Over the long term, it would reduce the number of juvenile and adult 
violent criminals. We need to put reformers to work right away and give them a 
time limit, no more than 180 days, to produce a framework for a new juvenile 
justice system. I offer one of my senior prosecutors to this effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The reformers should be nonpartisan; this is not about politics. It is about 
making California a safe, desirable place to live.

PERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH CARE; THE BUREAUCRAT WILL SEE YOU NOW; HEALTH PLANS CUT 
DOCTOR- PATIENT BONDS. IF DOCTORS BECOME INTERCHANGEABLE AND ANONYMOUS, 
PATIENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE THE SAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN D. JOHNSTON, Brian D. Johnston has been an emergency physician in Los 
Angeles for many years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A routine visit to the doctor's office or clinic today will not reveal the 
basic restructuring of the relationships between doctor, patient and employer 
or insurer that have taken place over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite apart from the changes contemplated in Washington, American medicine is 
becoming industrialized, bureaucratized and depersonalized to a degree that few 
would have imagined five years ago. These changes will have direct personal 
consequences for us all when we really need health care, and they are occurring 
with little public awareness or understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicine has traditionally been a one-on-one encounter centering on the doctor 
and patient. The patient sought the knowledge and skill of the physician, who 
became an advocate and champion for the patient. The physician referred to the 
patient as "my patient" (that may sound patronizing, but it at least declares 
ownership of the outcome). They got to know each other; the doctor explained 
the illness and embarked upon a course to cure or at least alleviate the 
problem. The doctor selected the drugs, the hospital, perhaps the surgeon and 
other specialists, and was responsible to the patient for these choices. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a very personal, sometimes emotionally draining process. Patients 
confided their deepest fears. Doctors kept their confidences safe and shared 
the burden with them. Oddly, this kind of relationship was more prevalent when 
doctors had less to offer in the way of cure. Despite comparatively meager 
results, physicians were revered and patients were treated as individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, increasingly, things are different. The physician is often selected from 
a list provided by the insurer. The doctor may be charged with making a 
diagnosis and proposing a cure, but now he or she doesn't work for the patient 
-- the doctor works for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient, instead of buying insurance to pay the doctor, has bought a plan. 
The principal relationships of doctor and patient are not with each other, but 
with the plan. The plan has more control over the physician than the patient 
does. The doctor doesn't set his or her schedule and can't control the time 
allotted a given patient, or even which patients he or she will see. There are 
restrictions on what tests and treatments can be ordered. If the assigned 
doctor recommends surgery or a diagnostic procedure, it will be "reviewed" 
before it is "authorized." The "review" may well be done by someone with little 
or no medical training, who doesn't know you, your disease, your circumstances, 
your doctor or the proposed procedure. The reviewer is often given incentive by 
the insurer to delay or deny authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 Your physician is now "profiled" by the managers of care to ensure 
"productivity" and "cost effectiveness." The managers are inclined to see 
physicians whose cost of care for a specific illness is high as "bad," and 
those whose cost of care for the same illness is low as "good," regardless of 
the fact that the "bad" physicians' patients might be sicker, thus needing more 
care, or the "good" physician might be denying patients legitimately needed 
care. It is far more difficult to stand up for your patients when you're being 
"profiled" by an employer who controls your economic fate. 
</P>
<P>
 What we are doing is rapidly replacing physician control of health care with 
control by administrators, bureaucrats and businessmen. We are doing so despite 
the fact that the new controllers may not be medically trained, have no 
knowledge of or connection to the patient and profit by withholding services. 
We are doing all this to control health-care costs -- something we all 
acknowledge we must do. 
</P>
<P>
 Business, government, insurers, hospital administrators and even some nurses 
have greeted these changes with enthusiasm. Physicians are told that if they 
don't join one plan or another, they will be outside the health-care system, 
with no patients at all. Proponents of the integrated systems ridicule 
one-on-one medicine, even though each of us, if we ever get sick, wants to be 
treated as an individual, by another individual who is answerable to us and our 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton touched on this issue when he promised that under his plan, 
each of us would be able to choose our own doctor. But the choice of a doctor 
is meaningless if the "contract" is with a plan, not the doctor, and if the 
doctor is so bureaucratically constrained as to be a mere functionary in a 
cost-driven system. More and more people in large plans are finding that when 
they're really sick, their doctor is not in a position to get them what they 
really need. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that all large, integrated systems are bad.. Kaiser, the 
Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Mayo and others have earned good reputations for 
medical care. And this is not to say that physicians' actions should never be 
reviewed. But the review should be by competent, medically trained persons 
whose sole objective is not cost-cutting. Better medical care will result when 
physicians are allowed the professional autonomy to make sound professional 
judgments based on individual patients' needs, and then held individually 
accountable for those judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 We must contain the cost of health care and extend coverage to all, but we 
must also insist that physicians be free to use their considerable knowledge, 
skill and training to our benefit. It is clearly in our self-interest to do so. 
We should choose systems that promote a close personal relationship and 
personal commitment between doctor and patient and hold the physician 
responsible for the outcome of care. If doctors become anonymous and 
interchangeable, the same thing will happen to patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that the vast majority of patients are satisfied with their 
doctors. That's not the problem. Cost control and universal access are the real 
problems. As we go forward with reform, we should preserve the "contract" 
between patient and doctor, while expanding access and controlling cost. If we 
don't keep that focus, we will pay our premiums only to find that we have 
bought a bureaucratic nightmare.

MIKE PENNER: MORE SEPARATES TWO TEAMS THAN JUST THEIR POWER PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE PENNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Yake was talking about those slumbering giants to the north, the 
wake-us-when-it's-April Kings, who happen to be the next opponent on the Mighty 
Ducks' schedule -- Friday night, on national television, with eighth place in 
the Western Conference on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a better team than they are five-on-five," Yake said so 
matter-of-factly that the words didn't register a response until the 
surrounding group of writers stopped their scribbling long enough to study it. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, Terry, I know they crank "Welcome To The Jungle" to 11 on the volume knob 
here, but my throbbing ears thought you just said . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you might say that's having a lot of confidence," Yake continued, 
beating those eardrums harder, "but those are the signs we've seen this year. 
I'm not comparing us to the team that made it to the Stanley Cup finals. That 
was last year. I can only go on what I've seen this year, and the only way 
they've been able to beat us is on the power play." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's go over this one more time, shall we? 
</P>
<P>
 Five-on-five, Yake says the Ducks are better than the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-on-five. That's Anatoli Semenov, Yake, Tim Sweeney, Bobby Dollas and 
Alexei Kasatonov for the Ducks . . . and Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri, Tomas 
Sandstrom, Rob Blake and Alexei Zhitnik for the Kings, just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Ewen, did you get a load of what Yake's saying over here? 
</P>
<P>
 Ewen, the Ducks' designated hitman, listened stoically as Yake's words were 
recited for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ewen didn't even bat an eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are better five-on-five," Ewen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By far. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot more puck-getters on this team. We're a solid four-line team, 
and when we involve all four corners and bump Jari Kurri and Wayne Gretzky off 
the puck, we are the better team." 
</P>
<P>
 This should come as big news to Kings' owner Bruce McNall, whose payroll is 
more than twice the size of Michael Eisner's $7.9-million dip into the loose 
change jar. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to Kings' Coach Barry Melrose, whose team is 3-0 against the Ducks, 
having outscored them, 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," Ewen added by way of disclaimer, "they've got a $12-million power play. 
That's what's been killing us." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken too many unnecessary penalties," Yake said. "We've helped them 
set up their power play. We play them tough for 60 minutes, but because of 
those (extra-man) chances, they're the ones who have two points to show for at 
the end of the night." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the standings support Yake and Ewen. Despite their 0-3 run 
against the Kings, the Ducks continue to lead them in the race for the Western 
Conference's final playoff spot, 46 points to 44. Sunday, the Ducks could have 
inflated that margin, but Sunday, the Ducks played a home game and you know 
what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellout crowd of 17,174. 
</P>
<P>
 One-goal loss, 3-2, this time to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Next for the Ducks are four days off and, then, Round 4 with the Kings, in 
front of the ESPN cameras. The Ducks are getting psyched for it, with many of 
them gathering around the TV screen Saturday night and cheering the Kings' 5-4 
loss to Calgary in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're keeping a pretty close eye on what they're doing," Yake said. "I don't 
know, as degradating (sic) as it sounds, we hope they lose every game. We get a 
break every night they lose. It keeps us in the race." 
</P>
<P>
 That there is any race between the Kings and the Ducks, on this late date in 
February, is one of the genuine shocks of this hockey season. The Ducks have 
already outstripped the preseason forecast of their coach -- Ron Wilson's 
October prediction for 1993-94: 18 victories -- and the Kings continue to flop 
around on the ice like a bunch of drunken seals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect the Kings every night to come out and blow somebody out," said 
Ducks' left wing Peter Douris, who is not alone. "Hopefully, people will keep 
coming in their building and beating them in overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Transition in this game can come quickly, Ewen maintains. Last year, the Kings 
reached the Stanley Cup finals, but last year "the Kings surprised people with 
the style they played," Ewen said. "Nobody in the conference had the power play 
and the special teams that the Kings had. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once they got to the finals, Montreal shut them down by playing great 
defense, grinding the games out. That's the style we play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people call it boring and say 'clutch-and-grab' should be banned from 
the league. But look at the success teams like Chicago and Montreal have had 
with it. We play it very well, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Well enough to add a Game of the Week atmosphere to their national television 
debut Friday night, which Yake and Ewen did their best to stoke Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the alarm sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we'll see if the Kings arise, or hit the snooze button and roll over.

COUNTDOWN TO LILLEHAMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; NO MIRACLE NECESSARY FOR U.S. TO 
WIN GOLD; HOCKEY PREVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Win one gold medal, and they expect you to win one in every Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 But miracles have been in short supply for the U.S. hockey team since 1980, 
when Herb Brooks' squad stunned the heavily favored Soviet Union and won at 
Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, seventh-place finishes at Sarajevo in 1984 and at Calgary in '88, 
followed by a fourth-place showing at Albertville two years ago, have made 
mythological heroes of the '80 team and villains of the coaches who failed to 
duplicate Brooks' success. 
</P>
<P>
 How did Lou Vairo compile only a 2-2-2 record with a team that included Al 
Iafrate, Chris Chelios and Pat LaFontaine? How did Dave Peterson, who had Mike 
Richter, Chris Terreri, Tony Granato, Brian Leetch and Craig Janney, not win a 
medal at Calgary? Why, with Ray LeBlanc performing acrobatics in goal, did 
Peterson's team again come home empty-handed in 1992? 
</P>
<P>
 Each time there was an excuse: Too tough an act to follow in '84. Too soft a 
pre-Olympic schedule in '88. Too little luck, too many defensive lapses and too 
much ignorance on the part of the media and fans in '92, according to Peterson, 
who played the role of Ugly American in two successive Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Taylor offers no prefabricated excuses for the team he will coach in the 
Winter Games, starting Saturday. And Taylor, who coached at Yale for 17 years 
and was an assistant to Vairo in '84, might not need any. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition appears closer than ever, the result of the United States 
producing more players who have more skills, and of traditional powers Russia, 
Sweden and Finland losing many of their best players to the NHL. In addition, 
Czechoslovakia, the bronze medalist in '92, has split into the Czech Republic 
and Slovakia, diluting each. 
</P>
<P>
 That gives the U.S. team solid medal hopes in probably the last Olympic hockey 
tournament involving anything close to amateur players. In 1998, the American 
and Canadian teams probably will be composed mostly of NHL players. 
</P>
<P>
 " Homogenized is a pretty good word," Taylor said of the Lillehammer field. 
"There are nine teams that will contend for medals, and five or six that will 
contend for gold. You used to look at the field and say there were two or three 
teams that would be battling it out for the gold, and everybody else would be 
going for silver and bronze. I don't think you can say that right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Russian Coach Viktor Tikhonov, who coached the Unified Team to the gold 
medal at Albertville: "This Olympics will be more difficult than the previous 
one. Sweden, Canada and the United States have very strong teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor listed the gold-medal contenders as the United States, Canada, Sweden, 
Russia, the Czech Republic and Finland. Russia is seeded first and grouped with 
the Czech Republic (seeded third), Germany, Finland, Austria and Norway. 
Sweden, seeded second, is grouped with Canada (fourth), the United States 
(sixth), Italy, France and Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team will play the others in its group once. The top four from each group 
will advance to the quarterfinals, matching the first-place team in each group 
against the runner-up of the opposite group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, our ultimate goal is to win the gold medal, and I don't think 
there's any reason we shouldn't have that as an ultimate goal," Taylor said. 
"Our expectations are high. We're optimistic, positive and determined, but 
we're realistic. It's a very tough competition, and you have to be prepared, 
conditioned and focused as a team and the puck has to bounce your way." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor scheduled enough international and NHL games to gauge his team's 
weaknesses, and enough games against college and minor-league opponents to 
build his players' confidence. He sculpted a young, fast team, oriented toward 
offense, reasoning that you can't teach a player to score but you can teach him 
to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 Team USA is 37-17-6 with one game left in pre-Olympic play after its 
disappointing 1-1-1 showing in the final warm-up tournament at Rouen, France, 
where it defeated Norway, tied France and lost to Sweden. It had a 29-13-3 
record against international opponents, and scored an average of more than five 
goals a game while giving up nearly four. How well the Americans learned to 
play in their own end of the ice might be the difference between a medal and 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been harping on defense all along," said Todd Martin, a 6-foot-4, 
210-pound defenseman who was drafted 66th by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1989. 
"The forwards and defensemen are helping each other and supporting each other. 
The emphasis is more on defense, and it's helped us so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpectedly, goaltending has become an issue. Mike Dunham, the third goalie 
at Albertville, was virtually assured of starting this time -- until he 
faltered in the last two months of pre-Olympic play. Garth Snow, his teammate 
and roommate at the University of Maine, overtook him in goals-against average 
(3.19 to Dunham's 3.89) and save percentage, .889 to .868. 
</P>
<P>
 "If alternating works, we will alternate," Taylor said, but historically, that 
hasn't worked. 
</P>
<P>
 In past U.S. successes, one goalie got all or most of the playing time: Jack 
McCartan led the U.S. team to the gold at Squaw Valley in 1960; Mike Curran 
helped win silver in 1972 and Jim Craig played every minute at Lake Placid in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. scoring threat depends on the line of Craig Johnson, Todd Marchant 
(the top pre-Olympic scorer) and Peter Ferraro. Marchant, who was drafted by 
the New York Rangers while at Clarkson University, is probably the team's 
swiftest skater and used that speed to score a team-high 28 goals in 55 games 
before the Rouen competition. Taylor described Ferraro as "puck lucky around 
the net," besides owning a hard, accurate shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Right wing Jim Campbell (24 goals before Rouen) and center Brian Rolston, who 
has adjusted well to the fast international game, are also scoring threats. 
</P>
<P>
 To guard the Soviet legacy of seven gold medals in eight Games, Tikhonov 
appears to have chosen experience over promise. He passed over 6-5 wing Viktor 
Kozlov of Moscow Dynamo, the sixth pick in last June's NHL draft; Sergei 
Gonchar, a 19-year-old defenseman with Moscow Dynamo who was drafted 14th two 
years ago, and several junior stars in forming his roster. The defense, 
however, is still relatively inexperienced, with five players 24 or younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Past Soviet teams built their fluid passing game on continuity, but Tikhonov 
will have no players returning from '92, unless forwards Andrei Khomutov and 
Viacheslav Bykov are released by Fribourg of the Swiss League. All eight 
defensemen from Albertville and nine of the forwards are in the NHL, but 
replacements have materialized with little apparent drop-off in skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden, which finished out of the medals at Albertville, has a mixed roster 
that includes five 30-year-olds, including former NHL stars Hakan Loob (Calgary 
Flames) and Mats Naslund (Montreal Canadiens), and a core of talented 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Kenny Jonsson, 19, was the Swedish Elite League's 1992 rookie of 
the year and was drafted 12th last June, by Toronto. A sturdy 6-3 and 189 
pounds, he's aggressive and an outstanding skater. 
</P>
<P>
 Also worth watching is center Peter Forsberg, traded by the Philadelphia 
Flyers to the Quebec Nordiques in the Eric Lindros deal. An exceptional 
playmaker, Forsberg was the Elite League's most valuable player last season and 
was called the best young player in the world by Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 Czech Coach Ivan Hlinka vowed to make sweeping changes after a poor 
performance in the Izvestia tournament, a dress rehearsal for the Olympics held 
last December. Most of his players were in other European professional leagues 
and haven't practiced much together. He won't have to worry about goaltending, 
because it's in the gloved hands of Petr Briza. Briza, 29, led Czechoslovakia 
to three bronze medals in the World Championships and to Olympic bronze at 
Albertville. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada had only one productive line -- Chris Kontos, Vancouver Canuck holdout 
Petr Nedved and Mighty Duck draft choice Paul Kariya -- until Coach Tom Renney 
made a flurry of last-minute changes to fortify the offense. He added 
minor-league right wing Jean-Yves Roy and Detroit Red Wing center Greg Johnson 
and summoned center Greg Parks back from Sweden. Also brought in were 
Washington Capital defensemen Brad Schlegel, a member of the 1992 silver 
medal-winning Canadian team, and Mark Astley, who was playing in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Renney's team is strong in goal with Corey Hirsch, a draftee of the New York 
Rangers, and solid if unspectacular on defense. "As long as we're sound 
defensively, the offense will take care of itself," Renney said.  
</P>
<P>
 Several of Finland's players will be familiar to NHL observers. Goalie Jarmo 
Myllys played for the Minnesota North Stars and the San Jose Sharks; Raimo 
Helminen was with the Rangers; Hannu Virta spent five seasons with the Buffalo 
Sabres and Mikko Makela skated for the New York Islanders and the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 A new face is center Saku Koivu, drafted 21st last June by the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 An explosive skater with quick moves, he's only 5-9 and 165 pounds and might 
be more effective in the lighter-hitting international game than in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovakia gained the final Olympic berth with the help of former NHL stars 
Peter and Anton Stastny. The new country won a pre-Olympic tournament, here, 
but it probably doesn't have enough depth to challenge the top-tier teams.

COUNTDOWN TO LILLEHAMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; USOC TALKS OF HARDING; OLYMPICS: 
BOARD TO MEET EARLY NEXT WEEK TO DETERMINE IF SKATER WILL REMAIN ON U.S. TEAM, 
SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Olympic Committee's Games Administrative Board will meet early next 
week to decide whether figure skater Tonya Harding can compete in the Winter 
Olympics, USOC sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the USOC's official position remained that it would announce this 
week whether to call a hearing to discuss the matter, one source said it was 
"97, 98, 99%" certain to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why we're playing games with you on that," said another source, 
adding that USOC officials were meeting into the early morning hours in 
Lillehammer today to try to set a date when all 13 members of the board could 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 As required by the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, Harding must be invited to 
appear at the hearing. Adding to the logistical complications, the USOC had no 
firm travel plans for her as of Sunday, but had been advised by her attorney 
that she might not arrive in Norway until Feb. 15, three days after Saturday's 
opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Figure Skating Assn. hearing panel reported Saturday in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., that it found reasonable grounds to believe Harding was 
involved in either the plan to attack rival Nancy Kerrigan during last month's 
national championships in Detroit or the cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, the USOC set in motion the process that could result in 
Harding's removal from the team if the Games Administrative Board decides that 
her actions violated the organization's code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 But the USOC's executive director, Harvey Schiller, said Sunday that the 
committee would not proceed until its president, LeRoy Walker, has time to 
evaluate more than 300 pages of documentation made available by the USFSA. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC has until Feb. 21, two days before the women's competition begins in 
Hamar, Norway, to name its two entrants. Kerrigan, who has recovered from knee 
injuries suffered in the assault, was waived onto the team, while Harding 
earned her berth by winning the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The first alternate is Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, who finished second to 
Harding in Detroit. Although International Olympic Committee rules do not allow 
alternates to live in the athletes' village or train in the official practice 
rink, the USFSA, according to a member of Norway's figure skating association, 
has reserved time at a rink near Oslo where Kwan can train until Harding's 
status is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwan is expected to arrive next Sunday or Monday in Oslo, about 110 miles 
south of Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question Saturday night about whether the USOC felt pressured 
to decide soon whether to hold a hearing, the U.S. team leader, Howard Buxton, 
said: "It's like the old cliche: in all deliberate haste. We have 151 athletes 
here. We can't allow this to continue to be a distraction. That time is of the 
essence is everyone's gut feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 That also was the argument advanced Sunday in informal discussions by 
administrative board members who want the hearing date set as soon as possible, 
sources said. "There are a number of us who want to bring this to closure as 
soon as possible," one said. "The Games are almost here. We need to get 
something done one way or the other. It's time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's difficult logistically. Some administrative board members are here, 
some are in Oslo, some are in the United States and some are en route. We're 
also being very careful because of all the little nuances. This thing has to be 
done properly in every respect. We want to make sure that Tonya's right to due 
process is protected." 
</P>
<P>
 The International Olympic Committee is the final judge of who competes in the 
Games. Although its secretary general, Francois Carrard, has repeatedly said 
the IOC will act on Harding's status, if necessary, other IOC officials have 
been adamant that they prefer this matter to be resolved by the USOC.

ANOTHER FIRST FOR SHOEMAKER; HORSE RACING: HE BECOMES FIRST FORMER JOCKEY TO 
TRAIN STRUB STAKES WINNER WHEN PINCAY WINS WITH DIAZO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Diazo's worst races, the 4-year-old colt's problems have been 
self-inflicted. He has pulled his jockey, Laffit Pincay, to the front 
prematurely, expending his energy and having nothing left for the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Sunday's $500,000 Strub Stakes at Santa Anita, Allen Paulson, the owner 
and breeder of Diazo, gave Pincay some advice. "You better eat your Wheaties," 
Paulson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 47th Strub, Pincay was at his best, conserving Diazo's energy early 
and then bringing him back after they had been passed near the wire. Diazo beat 
Nonproductiveasset by a nose in one of the closest finishes in Strub history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't good for the heart," said Paulson, who also had to wait out a foul 
claim by Nonproductiveasset's jockey, Corey Nakatani, before Diazo's number was 
posted on the tote board before an on-track crowd of 32,859. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Shoemaker, who won a record seven Strubs as a jockey, became the first 
former rider to train a winner of the stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great feeling," Shoemaker said. "I never felt this good when I rode 
all seven of those Strub winners." 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker removed the blinkers on Diazo three races back, and the colt won the 
Malibu Stakes, the opener of the three-race Strub series. Diazo gave Pincay 
another rough time three weeks ago, pushing for the lead before sputtering to a 
ninth-place finish in the San Fernando Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This little horse is game," Shoemaker said after Sunday's victory. "He's 
capable of coming back on you." 
</P>
<P>
 Paulson, the Eclipse Award winner for outstanding breeder last year, got 
$350,000 of the Strub purse, with his Stuka finishing third, beaten by about 1 
3/4 lengths. Both Diazo and Stuka are sons of Jade Hunter, who stands at 
Paulson's farm near Versailles, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with Stuka in the betting, Diazo paid $14.60, running 1 1/4 miles in 
2:00 1/5. Since the Shoemaker-ridden Spectacular Bid swept the Strub series in 
1980, only two horses -- Snow Chief and Best Pal -- have been faster winners of 
the Strub. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant Tango, the 17-10 favorite off of his third-place finish in the San 
Fernando, had traffic problems again Sunday and finished eighth after breaking 
last in the 11-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Zignew, the San Fernando winner, finished fourth, 2 1/2 lengths behind Diazo, 
and was vanned off the track. It was reported that he suffered a broken left 
foreleg, but the injury wasn't considered life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Zignew, acting like the Diazo of old, pulled jockey Chris McCarron to the 
front at the start of the far turn and then matched strides with Goldigger's 
Dream until Diazo edged past both of them with less than a furlong left. 
Nonproductiveasset, a consistent stakes threat since trainer Wally Dollase 
claimed him from Ted West for $40,000 at Hollywood Park eight months ago, was 
able to circle the field after lagging in ninth place for three-quarters of a 
mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonproductiveasset, on the outside, got a head in front of Diazo nearing the 
wire. "I was surprised that horse came by me," Pincay said. "But for some 
reason, I knew I still had a lot of horse under me, and he came back again." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani, who declined to comment after the race, made the foul claim, 
alleging interference at the five-sixteenths marker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened (regarding the claim)," Pincay said. "I never saw 
the other guy. I never heard anything. I was on the outside most of the time, 
and I just don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonproductiveasset was second, 1 3/4 lengths behind Zignew, in the San 
Fernando. He picked up two pounds off that race, to 118, while Diazo stayed at 
120. Sunday's highweight, Kissin Kris, finished sixth while carrying 124 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a great thrill," Dollase said of Nonproductiveasset's near-miss. "He 
gave us a big effort, and he should make a nice living for my family down the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
 Diazo still had energy to burn past the finish line. Coming back to the 
winner's circle, he dumped Pincay as a track official tried to drape the wreath 
of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He broke the same way he did last time," Pincay said, "and he would have gone 
on (to the lead), but I had a tight rein. I jerked him back, got him behind 
horses and he came back to me. I know some people have said that he couldn't 
get this distance, but if he runs the right way, he can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 At 1 1/4 miles last year, Diazo was fifth in both the Kentucky Derby and 
Belmont Park's Jockey Club Gold Cup, and sixth in the Breeders' Cup Classic at 
Santa Anita. The Strub was his sixth victory in 13 starts, pushing his earnings 
to $681,400. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Laffit Pincay, who has ridden in the race 24 times, scored his fifth victory 
in the Strub and his first since Affirmed won in 1979. He won the race in 1967 
with Drin, his first Strub mount, and also won with Snow Sporting in 1970 and 
Ancient Title, who swept the series in 1974. . . . Unofficially, Pincay, 48, 
has won 8,076 races, second to Bill Shoemaker's 8,833. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after his 26th birthday, jockey David Flores suffered a broken 
collarbone when he was dumped by Chapar in a rough run into the first turn in 
the fifth race. . . . X-rays Sunday morning showed that Chris McCarron suffered 
a small fracture in his right hand. McCarron, who rode two winners after the 
spill that caused the injury Saturday, rode all of his mounts but one Sunday, 
finishing fourth in the Strub on Zignew. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela, who has skipped eight of the first 33 days of the meeting, 
called in sick Sunday. "I realize it's a big race, but I'm too sick to make 
it," Valenzuela told steward Ingrid Fermin. Ridden by his cousin, Fernando 
Valenzuela, his mount, Justtofit, finished last in the Strub. 
</P>
<P>
 The stewards have suspended Gary Stevens for five days, starting Wednesday, 
for an incident in a race on Saturday. . . . Corey Black, who is appealing a 
five-day Santa Anita suspension that was to have started Sunday, was at Turf 
Paradise to ride Megan's Interco, who finished in a dead heat for first with 
Ranger in the $108,500 Budweiser Breeders' Cup Stakes. . . . With eight horses 
scratched when the race was moved from the turf to dirt, Mamselle Bebette won 
the Monrovia Handicap, another stake on Sunday's Santa Anita card.. . . Between 
races, Phil Grove received the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award for 1994. 
Grove rode more than 3,700 winners.

MIKE DOWNEY: THEIR EYES REMAIN ON REAL PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven months have gone by. The grandly named rematch -- La Revancha 
Explosiva! -- will be a week from Saturday at the Forum. It is a prizefight a 
lot of people have been waiting for, particularly the prizefighters themselves. 
Michael Carbajal has been waiting, and not simply because the prize he's 
getting for it is a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't ordinarily make a million for a fight when you weigh 108 pounds. But 
boxing is in dire need of a new face, a new star. The Haglers, Hearnses, Durans 
and Leonards are history or on their last legs. Chavez is invincible no more. 
Norris got pounded. Tyson is behind bars, Foreman is doing sitcoms, Bowe has 
been beaten and Holyfield is handsome and brave but hardly Mr. Charisma. So it 
could be up to Michael Carbajal, the lightning-flashy light-flyweight, to save 
the day for boxing, to be the man. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still undefeated. Not much of that going around anymore. But the memory 
of that rumble last March 13, of that wild evening in the ring he spent, 
remains vivid. Carbajal will never forget that main event. Neither will those 
who saw it go down, who saw him go down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wasn't that some fight?" Michael himself asked when it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even called it the greatest fight they ever saw. Carbajal was mixing it 
up in Las Vegas with this lantern-chinned character everybody kept calling 
Chiquita, which means little one. The name fit. Even wearing boxing boots, 
Chiquita Gonzalez, going 5 feet 1, barely stood as high as his opponent's 
mouthpiece. But relentlessly the little one kept boring in, boring in, boring 
in, until abruptly a left-right combination lashed out at his face and then 
there stood Chiquita, looking down on him . 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody had ever knocked down Michael Carbajal. Not even back home in his 
nails-hard neighborhood, in La Nueve, there in the meanest part of Phoenix, 
where the gangs, the cholos , had terrorized the area with "drive-by shootings, 
stabbings, everything," Michael remembers. About the only reason few punks 
messed with any of the nine Carbajal kids was because their fighter father had 
taught every one of them, sisters included, how to put up their dukes. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix has had its share of tough customers, in all shapes and sizes. Most 
everybody was aware that Charles Barkley, the tall basketball player for the 
Suns, had been known to land a solid left hook in a corner cantina. Buddy Ryan, 
the round football coach just hired by the Cardinals, had recently been seen 
aiming a roundhouse right at a colleague's kisser. Could be that Carbajal would 
be called upon to offer the new bully in town a few pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I don't know," Michael says. "He hits pretty good for a guy that old."  
</P>
<P>
 Humberto Gonzalez hits pretty good for a guy that small. Humberto is Chiquita. 
He is 27 and a father of three, and he hails from Ciudad Neza, Mexico, where he 
once worked in his father's butcher shop. Chiquita is fearless. In a ring, he 
doesn't box, he stalks. Sometimes he fights right-handed, sometimes 
left-handed, but always he goes forward, swinging away, leaving himself open to 
be easily hit, not very fast but forever dangerous. His record is 37-2 and he 
has knocked out 26 opponents. One of them was almost Michael Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Round 2, and already Chiquita had won the first. Carbajal attempted a 
combination and missed. Gonzalez put him down. It was the first time the 1988 
Olympic silver medalist had been horizontal, and his brother Danny, who trains 
him, grew anxious in the Carbajal corner until his brother staggered back to 
his stool between rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept telling me not to worry, that he was OK, that he was getting stronger 
and was ready to lay out Chiquita," Danny said. "And that's what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Not without resistance. After winning the third and fourth rounds, Michael ran 
into a strong right hand during the fifth and again hit the deck. He rose, more 
slowly than before, and survived the remainder of the round. But Chiquita kept 
after him, dominating the sixth round, backing Carbajal into a neutral corner 
with four rat-a-tat-tat punches. Ahead by four points on all the judges' 
scorecards, Gonzalez was within striking distance of the undisputed 
light-flyweight championship of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 With seconds remaining in the seventh round, however, Chiquita was sent 
reeling into the ropes by a left hook to that amazingly square jaw of his. 
Headfirst he crashed to the canvas, where he was counted out. At the moment 
when referee Mills Lane said "10, yer out," there was one second remaining in 
the round. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder the rematch prospect excites people so. More than a thousand milled 
around the Forum's parking lot last weekend when Carbajal, Gonzalez and several 
others from this superb Feb. 19 card came by for a little grandstanding and 
gentle sparring. Carbajal was mobbed, same way he is back home in Phoenix, 
where his popularity is such that Barkley and Ryan might fight over which of 
them will be the town's second favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez had his own backers on hand, as did classy Rafael Ruelas and wacky 
Jorge Paez, both of whom also are part of this card. But none of the 
name-calling and threats of humiliation that accompany many fights were 
noticeable here, Carbajal and Gonzalez behaving civilly toward one another and 
even posing together for photos. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal (30-0) does use a few psychological tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chiquita's punches weren't all that much," Carbajal said. "I made a couple of 
mistakes he better not expect me to make this time." 
</P>
<P>
 He made a couple of mistakes in his most recent fight, too, last Oct. 30 at 
Phoenix. One was a haircut. The other was leaving himself open for a punch from 
Domingo Sosa that split the right side of his head. Blood streamed down 
Carbajal's smoothly shaved temples -- he wore what amounted to a Mohawk -- 
instead of being absorbed by his hair. It spilled into his eyes, so luridly 
that Danny Carbajal nearly threw in the towel from the corner. But Michael 
rallied from the three-inch gash to beat Sosa with a sixth-round TKO. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been waiting for the Chiquita rematch ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who hasn't?" Carbajal asked. "That was probably the fight of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 And this one will be. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "Shorter," he said.

SHE TURNS RACE INTO BLOWOUT; WINTERNATIONALS: 'DID I WIN?' ANDERSON ASKS AFTER 
WINNING THE TOP-FUEL TITLE IN A CAR THAT HAD LOST A TIRE DOWN THE STRIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shelly Anderson finished on a rim and a prayer in her father's top-fuel 
dragster, but it was enough for the former cheerleader from Royal Oak High in 
Covina to win the Chief Auto Parts Winternationals, opening event of the 
National Hot Rod Assn. season Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, 28-year-old daughter of former racer Brad Anderson, was past the 
halfway mark in the finals against Rance McDaniel when her left rear tire 
exploded, sending the wheel over a retaining wall at Pomona Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel's car had already lost traction and was far behind, allowing Anderson 
to stagger to the finish line in a hail of sparks in 5.464 seconds at 178.74 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Not fast, compared to drag racing's all-time record run of 4.751 seconds, set 
earlier in the day by four-time champion Joe Amato, but fast enough to earn her 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Amato, who made his record run in eliminating No. 1 qualifier Cory 
McClenathan, was eliminated in the semifinals by McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did I win?" Anderson asked after climbing out of the broken car in the final. 
When an NHRA official informed her that she had, she said: "The car is junk, 
but we won and that's what matters. We can fix the car." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second victory for the Cal State Fullerton graduate. Her first came 
in last year's Keystone Nationals at Reading, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the trouble we had all day, it was crazy to win this way," she 
said. In two earlier rounds, Anderson had mechanical problems, but managed to 
keep her foot down and her dragster moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't any big deal," she said of her dramatic rides, including one in 
which her long dragster almost got sideways. "That's part of driving." 
</P>
<P>
 K.C. Spurlock, who won the Winternationals in the first race he entered in 
1990, came back to win the funny car final against Al Hofmann in a photo 
finish. Spurlock, in a Dodge Daytona, grabbed a narrow lead at the start, even 
though Hofmann's Olds Cutlass had a quicker run. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurlock, despite not having been in a race car since 1990, took 5.128 seconds 
for the quarter-mile to Hofmann's 5.123, winning the race with a quicker 
reaction time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew how good a driver Al is, and I knew he was going to give it his all, 
so I gave it my all and got away just ahead of him," Spurlock said. "I think I 
appreciate this one a lot more than my win here in '90, because now I know how 
tough it is to win. Back then, I didn't know what it took." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Johnson, who won pro stock championships in 1992 and 1993 in a 
Oldsmobile Cutlass while 1990 and 1991 champion Darrell Alderman was under 
suspension, faced Alderman's Dodge Daytona in the pro stock final and won by 
half a car-length in 7.095 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Race officials announced a four-day attendance of 100,200, of whom about 
45,000 were on hand Sunday. Upsets became the order of the day early in top 
fuel as defending champion Eddie Hill and the four fastest qualifiers -- 
McClenathan, Jimmy Nix, Kenny Bernstein and Scott Kalitta -- were all sent 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
 In funny cars, series champion John Force went out in the first round, 
followed by No. 1 qualifier Cruz Pedregon in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Force, driving what he called a Chevrolet Lumina -- although insiders insisted 
it was his old Olds chassis with a new paint job -- lost to Kenji Okazaki's 
Dodge Daytona by 0.013 seconds. The victory proved costly for Okazaki, who came 
from Japan two years ago to learn drag racing from Jim Dunn, because it cost 
the team an engine and clutch when a rod blew out of the block. Okazaki was 
unable to get to the starting line for his semifinal run against Spurlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just ran out of parts," said Dunn, who operates the Mooneyes team with his 
wife, Diane, in Long Beach.

PRO BOWL; FALCONS' RISON AND HEBERT LEAD NFC OVER AFC, 17-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a Pro Bowl dominated by defense and turnovers, thank the Atlanta Falcons 
for a bit of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Rison had six receptions for 86 yards and teammate Bobby Hebert, a late 
fill-in for injured Troy Aikman, engineered two quick touchdowns in the second 
half Sunday to help the NFC to a 17-3 victory over the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison was voted the most valuable player of the season-ending all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I've won the MVP of anything," he said. "It's especially 
great when you compete against such top-echelon athletes. In fact, my next 
tattoo will say 'MVP Pro Bowl '94.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here four years in a row, but this is the best. The only thing left 
for me to do is score a touchdown in the Pro Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert, playing only because Aikman and Phil Simms were injured, completed 
four of six passes for 68 yards, including a 15-yard touchdown pass to Cris 
Carter of the Minnesota Vikings 1:19 into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big play," Hebert said. "Cris Carter beat the coverage to get open 
and get into the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 That score followed a fumble recovery by Richard Dent of the Chicago Bears, 
who fell on the ball at the AFC 19 after the Vikings' John Randle stripped the 
ball from Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Jerome Bettis of the Rams scored the game's only other touchdown on a 
four-yard run late in the third quarter, capping a 48-yard drive that included 
a 32-yard pass from Hebert to Rison. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFC defense came up with four interceptions and two fumble recoveries as 
the AFC offense struggled. Chicago's Donnell Woolford intercepted a pass by 
Boomer Esiason in the NFC end zone with 4:30 remaining to wrap up the victory 
for the NFC. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Norton of the Dallas Cowboys was a standout for the NFC defense, with six 
solo tackles and two assists.

 Suzy Hamilton, who miscounted how many laps remained, stopped and screamed, 
"Oh, no!" at the start of the bell lap of the women's mile in the Mobil 
Invitational indoor track and field meet at Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, who trailed by as many as 30 yards during the first half of the 
race, was leading Olympic gold medalist and defending world champion Hassiba 
Boulmerka of Algeria by 15 meters with 200 left when she realized her mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulmerka went on to win in 4:28.64.

 "I'm a college graduate," said the former Wisconsin runner with a rueful

starting her kick too late and missing a chance to medal.

 Hamilton's gaffe Sunday overshadowed a day in which Michael Johnson turned 
back a strong challenge by Steve Lewis in the men's 400 meters and Gail Devers 
continued her supremacy in the women's 60-meter hurdles. Devers turned back 
Jamaica's Michelle Fleeman with a time of 7.85 seconds.

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; COUNTDOWN TO LILLEHAMER / '94 WINTER 
OLYMPICS; HARDING AT OPENING CEREMONY A QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until further notice, figure skater Tonya Harding has all the rights and 
privileges of any other member of the U.S. team for the 1994 Winter Olympics, 
including an invitation to participate in Saturday's opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, she's a team member," said Harvey Schiller, U.S. Olympic Committee 
executive director, Sunday, one day after announcing that an administrative 
board might meet within the next two weeks to determine whether Harding can 
compete in the Games. "Nothing has changed in regard to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller added he does not expect Harding to arrive in Lillehammer until the 
middle of next week, but he said no firm date has been set for her travel. And 
other USOC officials emphasized that she is almost predictably unpredictable. 
"I don't think she'll be here, from what I hear," said one official, who did 
not want to be identified. "She'll have to surprise us. But she's done that 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has time reserved at the rink where she trains in Portland, Ore., 
through Friday, but she said during the national championships last month in 
Detroit, where she earned an Olympic berth by finishing first, that she looked 
forward to marching in both the opening and closing ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did she miss the opening ceremony for the 1992 Winter Olympics in 
Albertville, France, she did not arrive until two days before her competition 
started, giving herself little time to adjust to changes in time and climate. 
One year after winning the silver medal in the World Championships, she 
finished a disappointing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be more fun this time," she said last month. "I'm going to do 
the opening and closing ceremonies. It's an experience I should have seen the 
first time. I realize that was wrong. I'm going to take every opportunity I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Michelle Kwan of Torrance is called upon to compete as a replacement for 
Harding, she will be the first alternate to represent the United States in 
Olympic figure skating since 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 Maribel Vinson and George Hill withdrew from the pairs competition when 
Harvard would not allow Hill to take time off from classes because he was on 
academic probation. They were replaced by Gertrude Meredith and Joseph Savage, 
who finished last. 
</P>
<P>
 Savage also served as the chief referee of the speedskating competition. He 
was 52, the oldest person to compete for the United States in the Winter 
Olympics. Kwan, 13, would be the youngest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the U.S. figure skating championships in Detroit, enrollment in the Lake 
Arrowhead Ice Castle International Training Center's Learn to Skate Program has 
increased 400%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows whether it's because it's an Olympic year or because of this?" said 
Frank Carroll, who coaches Kwan at the Ice Castle. 
</P>
<P>
 This , of course, is the worldwide publicity surrounding Tonya Harding and 
Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe (our students) had better take martial arts and figure skating at the 
same time," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With the IOC's announcement that no new members will be named at this week's 
session, the United States has gone 2 1/2 years with only one representative, 
Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Although she is recognized as one of the IOC's most effective members, she 
insists that she cannot do the job alone, particularly with Salt Lake City's 
campaign for the 2002 Winter Olympics coming to a head next year. The IOC has 
promised that she will have a U.S. colleague by the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Among the official delegation from the U.S. government to Saturday's opening 
ceremony will be Dawn Steel, who produced "Cool Runnings," a movie about the 
Jamaican bobsled team. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Society of Olympic Historians called it "a movie of bad 
Olympic history." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not for a minute expect any ISOH members to respect it at all for its 
flagrant lack of respect for many things Olympic and the liberties it takes 
with the true story line," society secretary general, Bill Mallon, wrote in the 
ISOH Journal. "Having said all of the above," he continued, "I really enjoyed 
the movie."

COUNTDOWN TO LILLEHAMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; EVEN WITH EXPORTS, RUSSIA STILL 
HAS A HOCKEY WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexei Kovalev greeted Alex Zhitnik, who was chatting with Sergei Zubov, while 
Sergei Nemchinov and Alexander Karpovtsev were deep in a discussion, perhaps 
deciding where they would go after their game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not in Moscow, but in Inglewood, between the Kings and the New York 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL is home to so many expatriates from the former Soviet Union that 
nearly every night, the exotic and deep sounds of Russian resound through the 
corridors outside their locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Closely pursuing the Kings' Wayne Gretzky for the NHL scoring title is center 
Sergei Fedorov, who four years ago exchanged his Central Red Army uniform for 
the winged wheel of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings. As he blossoms into one of the 
league's best two-way players and earns consideration for most-valuable-player 
honors, he has a four-year, $11.7-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Fedorov's former linemates, Pavel Bure and Alexander Mogilny, are thriving, 
too. Bure led the Vancouver Canucks in scoring last season with 60 goals and 
110 points. Mogilny, of the Buffalo Sabres, tied for the league scoring lead 
with 76 goals. He was named the Sabres' captain this season after Pat 
LaFontaine suffered a season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Also flourishing is center Alexei Yashin of the Ottawa Senators, a top 
candidate for rookie of the year. The Winnipeg Jets' Alexei Zhamnov, the 
Philadelphia Flyers' Dmitri Yuskevitch, the Toronto Maple Leafs' Dmitri 
Mironov, the Sabres' Yuri Khmylev and the Red Wings' Viacheslav Kozlov and 
Vladimir Konstantinov are mainstays of their teams, too. 
</P>
<P>
 They are merely the more recent arrivals. Viacheslav Fetisov of the New Jersey 
Devils, Alexei Kasatonov of the Mighty Ducks and Sergei Makarov and Igor 
Larionov of the San Jose Sharks, who have each played three NHL seasons or 
more, are old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fruits of the Soviet hockey program continue to be harvested by the NHL, 
and there's no end in sight to either the outbound stream of talent or the 
success of the Russian team, heir to the legend of the Big Red Machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey players have become a major export for Russia and its neighbors as they 
struggle with the economic and social upheaval of the Soviet breakup. Transfer 
fees collected from teams in the NHL, Switzerland, Finland and Germany line the 
pockets of the factions fighting for control of Russian hockey, instead of 
supporting local clubs, yet that nation continues to churn out a steady supply 
of clever puck-handlers and dazzling skaters who will challenge for another 
gold medal in the Winter Olympics, opening Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, they've lost an awful lot of players to the NHL, but they're perhaps one 
of the best countries at developing talent, and they have a wealth of it," said 
Tim Taylor, coach of the U.S. Olympic team. "I still think Russia has to be 
considered one of the favorites. They are perhaps the best team (at) developing 
talent and they have a wealth of it. They've got an awful lot of excellent 
hockey players and coaches in that country." 
</P>
<P>
 The gold medal won at Albertville in 1992 by the Unified Team, as it was then 
known, was supposed to be the last hurrah for the Soviet system and for 
venerable Coach Viktor Tikhonov. The predicted collapse hasn't happened, for 
several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 With a population of 150 million and a spirit that remains fierce in the face 
of famine and economic hardship, Russia still produces enough players to 
compensate for its losses. Its coaches still emphasize technique over 
competition well into players' teen years, scheduling relatively few games so 
they can spend time refining skating and passing skills. That combination of 
sheer numbers, attitude and attention to detail enables Russia to prevail over 
countries that have experienced similar talent drains. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the Russian talent pool has decreased, so has the Swedish pool, the 
Finnish pool and the Czech pool," said Paul Theofanous, an agent who represents 
several Russian players in the NHL and has traveled extensively in Russia. 
"Bank on the place with the larger reserve of players, and that's Russia any 
day of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 So, although the nation's best players might be skating for NHL teams, the 
squad that will represent Russia in the Olympics is rated one of the favorites 
to win the hockey tournament. And that's even if high-scoring forwards 
Viacheslav Bykov and Andrei Khomutov aren't released by Fribourg of the Swiss 
League, their current employer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russians still have those skills -- that's part of their game you can't 
take away," said Chuck Grillo, vice president and director of player personnel 
for the San Jose Sharks. "That and the hockey sense. That part's fine, no 
matter what else has happened over there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you replace the Larionovs, Bykovs and Khomutovs. I don't think 
they make guys like that anymore, anywhere in the world. But to measure what 
kind of talent they have left, look at this: In Izvestia (a major international 
tournament held in Russia in December), they had two teams and they ended up in 
the finals against each other." 
</P>
<P>
 At Izvestia, in which Canada, the United States, Sweden and the Czech Republic 
entered virtually the same squads that will compete in the Winter Olympics, 
Tikhonov's team trounced a team coached by former Soviet star Boris Mikhailov. 
However, Tikhonov, who has coached three gold medal-winning teams, would not 
declare it an omen of Russian Olympic success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not in favor of forecasting the future," he said. "However, I always try 
to develop the psychology of a winner in my players." 
</P>
<P>
 He seems to have no trouble doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Granted, Tikhonov is getting older, but he's still got his marbles," 
Theofanous said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tikhonov, who is in his late 60s, can't keep his players from leaving home 
to earn American or Canadian dollars or Swiss francs to buy the luxuries 
unavailable to them in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days of players who competed in two Olympics or even three, as 
defense partners Fetisov and Kasatonov did when their team won the silver medal 
in 1980 and the gold in '84 and '88. The legendary goaltender, Vladislav 
Tretiak, also helped win the gold in 1972 and '76 and the silver in '80. Gone 
are the days when a trio of forwards would skate alongside each other so long, 
their line would earn a nickname that brought instant international 
recognition, like the K-L-M line of Vladimir Krutov, Larionov and Makarov. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at it, and they were always able to keep their superstars together," 
Grillo said. "That's why we think there's a drop-off in the quality of their 
play, because they don't have the same units for as long as they used to and 
they have to replace people. But no one's been able to do it here, either. 
There's never been a group kept together at one level -- an NHL team or an 
Olympic team." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 27 players on the preliminary Russian roster for the Olympics, only two 
played at Albertville in 1992 -- and those two, Khomutov and Bykov, probably 
won't be released by their professional teams for these Games. A blend of the 
two squads that competed at Izvestia, the Russian team has two defensemen who 
are 23 and two who are 22, including Andrei Sapozhnikov, a fifth-round draft 
choice of the Boston Bruins last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, it has mainly players who have experience in the World 
Championships, although few have been drafted by NHL teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable among the forwards are Valeri Karpov, a 22-year-old left wing chosen 
56th overall by the Mighty Ducks last June; 20-year-old left wing Andrei 
Nikolishin, who was selected 47th in 1992 by the Hartford Whalers, and right 
wing Ramil Gusmanov, picked 93rd last year by the Jets. Not drafted but sure to 
grab the attention of NHL general managers is center Georgy Yevtyukin, 23, who 
was voted the most valuable player on the Izvestia Cup championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference from past Russian teams is the diversity on the roster. 
Moscow Dynamo and the Central Red Army teams used to supply the majority of the 
Olympic players, but there's now a mix from outside Moscow. Many play for 
Chelyabinsk and Spartak, but Chimik, Togliatti and Krylja Sovetov also 
contributed players. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an incredible amount of hockey talent over here," Mark Kelley, a 
scout who is part of a partnership between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the 
Central Red Army team, told the Ottawa Citizen. "They have some tremendous 
players. I don't see any falling off in ability at the junior level from 10 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian junior team was third in the World Junior Championships in 
December, but it went to the unusual extreme of asking two players to come back 
from North America for the tournament. Right wing Valeri Bure, brother of the 
Canucks' Pavel Bure and a second-round pick by Montreal in the '92 draft, and 
left wing Maxim Bets were playing for Spokane of the Western Hockey League when 
they were invited to play for Russia. Bure was named to the tournament all-star 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a measure of the talent Tikhonov believes he has that Bure and Bets 
aren't on the Russian Olympic squad. Nor is Oleg Tverdovsky, a dynamic 
17-year-old defenseman whom the NHL's Central Scouting Bureau rated the best 
European player available in the June draft. Nor is left wing Alexander 
Kharlamov, son of the late Valeri Kharlamov, who was ranked behind Tverdovsky 
on Central Scouting's list. Of the bureau's top 20 Europeans eligible for the 
June draft, six are Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 Those players will skate for Russia in 1998, if not before, and they promise 
to continue the great Soviet-Russian hockey tradition. That's unless the 
economic crisis battering Russia eats any further into the hockey program. 
Teams are drawing few fans and are having difficulty meeting day-to-day 
operating costs since the political system collapsed and government funding 
evaporated, and Kelley, who is based in Moscow, noted players using old, 
hand-me-down equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a crop," Kelley said. "You can always have great seeds, but you've 
got to water it and care for it or it will just wither away."

BLACKHAWKS' GOALIE BELFOUR HOLDS THE DUCKS TO A DULL ROAR THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour remembered the roar when the Blackhawks last 
played the Mighty Ducks in Chicago Stadium, and he didn't like the sound of it 
one bit. 
</P>
<P>
 A rumble of discontent too loud to ignore tumbled out of the old building's 
ancient stands as the Ducks scored a convincing 6-2 victory Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the Roar is the catchy slogan for the Blackhawks' final season at 
Chicago Stadium, but that noise wasn't what Belfour had in mind. It was a tough 
night -- Belfour stopped only 17 of 23 shots, including one of four in the 
pivotal second period -- and the fans let him have it. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with those unpleasant memories for motivation, Belfour went out and 
stopped the Ducks cold in Chicago's 3-2 victory Sunday at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us a real bad time in Chicago and the boys were thinking about that 
today," Belfour said after stopping 26 of 28 shots Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Several times he got help from the goal posts, but he handled the best the 
Ducks could fire at him and came away a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Ducks fell behind, 3-1, after the first period, Chicago went into a 
Duck-like defensive shell, but Belfour still faced a number of quality shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were relentless around the Blackhawks' net. Well, as relentless as a 
defensive-oriented expansion team can get, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really pressing hard," Belfour said. "Shots were coming from 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Most ended up in Belfour's grasp, enabling the Blackhawks to gain a measure of 
revenge for last month's thrashing, the Ducks' widest margin of victory this 
season and a night to forget for Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was so much different. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks smothered the Ducks, rarely allowing their forwards open space. 
Chicago gave up occasional scoring chances, but Belfour (23-14-4) was sharp all 
but twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sacco beat him with a long slap shot from the top of the right circle in 
the first period and Troy Loney pounced on a bad pass from Chicago defenseman 
Eric Weinrich and scored on a low shot from point-blank range in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "He dares you to shoot between his pads," Duck goalie Guy Hebert said. "And if 
you should beat him he'll say, 'All right, you're not going to beat me again.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Duck forward Tim Sweeney: "Anytime you get in close against Belfour you 
have to take it upstairs (high). The chances were there, but we couldn't take 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Belfour wasn't about to give the Ducks second chances on Sunday. He'd seen 
what they could do and wasn't ready for a repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't such a good game for us last time," he said. "It's nice to come 
here and give them a little payback."

ROCKETS CALL OFF THREE-PLAYER TRADE AFTER THE PISTONS' ELLIOTT FAILS PHYSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Houston Rockets on Sunday called off their trade for Detroit Piston 
forward Sean Elliott after he failed to pass a physical. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich would not say what part of the physical Elliott 
had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-8 forward was traded Friday for forwards Robert Horry and Matt 
Bullard. He took a physical Saturday in Houston, then Rocket physician Bruce 
Moseley requested additional tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott, who had knee surgery in high school, plays with braces on both knees. 
Last season, playing for the San Antonio Spurs, he sat out 12 games because of 
back problems. He sat out his last four games with the Pistons because of 
pneumonia.

Q&A WITH DICK CLARK; 'POPULAR MUSIC IS THE SOUNDTRACK OF OUR . . . LIVES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hair contains strands of gray. The face reveals the occasional wrinkle. 
Believe it or not, America's oldest teen-ager is almost a senior citizen.  
</P>
<P>
 Dick Clark is 64 years old. How can that be? He was supposed to remain 
eternally young, frozen in our stubborn illusions of his immortality.  
</P>
<P>
 But aging or not, he hasn't reduced his workload. This month alone, Clark is 
producing five prime-time television specials, including last Friday's "Soap 
Opera Digest Awards" and tonight's "American Music Awards" on ABC. The others 
range from a Valentine's Day-related show about marriage proposals (Sunday) to 
a look at teen idols (which he'll host on Feb. 15, using footage from his old 
"American Bandstand" series) to a country music program (Feb. 19).  
</P>
<P>
 Clark is best known, of course, for his three decades as host of "American 
Bandstand," which, before MTV, offered the younger generation its first peek at 
the hottest new music acts. He still hosts two nationally syndicated weekly 
radio shows -- "Rock, Roll & Remember" and "Countdown America" -- but spends 
most of his time running dick clark productions in Burbank, which, in 1987, 
went public. The company specializes in producing the kind of light 
entertainment specials that are on view this month.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why do people love awards shows so much? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is so little live television. People look to see if there will 
be an accident, a surprise, something unexpected. Anything that's live these 
days draws a big audience because we're satiated on prepared material. Women 
tune in to see the clothing, the hair styles. Obviously, we tune in to see the 
punch line -- who won? An awful lot of people who watch say, "I would like to 
be there in that audience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After 20 years, is it tough to keep "The American Music Awards" fresh? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, the material changes. I look, year to year, and say, "Oh, God, last 
year, we were desperate to have this person or these people involved and this 
year, we don't care. They're not even nominated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the key to making your sort of specials work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think you ever really know. You try to find something that's easy 
to promote so that the network can draw some kind of audience. "Will You Marry 
Me" is an awfully easy show to talk about; it's a big hit in Europe. Surprising 
one another with proposals should draw women, especially if there are a lot of 
hot sports on (the Winter Olympics) that night.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any plans to use more "American Bandstand" footage, as you do in the "Teen 
Idol" show? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Eventually, all of that stuff will go into a museum. But it's very 
expensive to show it. That's why it's not out there all the time. That's why 
it's not in videos. You've got guilds and unions. You've got copyright owners. 
It's endless. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think of music these days? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Nothing about the talent has changed. The business has changed. It's now 
owned by five or six multinational corporations, run by people who deal very 
much with the bottom line. Breaks for new people are negligible. There's so 
much money invested in the well-known names, perpetuating their careers and 
recouping the investment, that you and I, if we just started now, would have a 
steep uphill battle. In the old days, you'd find a guy who managed the business 
out of his garage, and you'd be the star, the mainstay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about MTV? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a great promotion tool. It has been since the day it started. The 
unfortunate part that bothers me as an adult is that it strips you of your 
imagination to listen to a record and conjure up your own pictures in your 
mind. That's sad. You and I grew up that way. You listened to the radio, and 
then you wrote a screenplay (with your imagination). Now you see the darn thing 
as the director of that video saw it: "That's where the car crashes. That's 
where the guy jumps through the window." 
</P>
<P>
 I guess it has changed the appreciation of music for young people because 
their minds don't play the song. Think of all the songs you have listened to 
all your life. Popular music is the soundtrack of our individual lives. 
Anything that ever happened to you, good or bad, was scored with the music you 
listened to. I'm not sure that's happening to today's generation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you get tired of being called America's oldest teen-ager? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's tough because I have to look in the mirror every day. To have people 
continually remind you or crawl up within five inches of your face and say I 
look pretty good for a guy my age is meant to be a compliment, but it adds that 
heavy-duty imposition on you -- "There's another wrinkle. There's another gray 
hair." But I use it. The first man to ever call me that was almost 30 years 
ago. What it does, it breaks the ice. I did Arsenio Hall last night. He used 
it. I ask people to use "America's Oldest Teen-ager" in an introductory phrase 
they'll use in a speech because it brings a smile to people's faces. I can 
react to it. I can pretend to be annoyed. It just breaks the ice at a social 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you look so great? 
</P>
<P>
 A: God knows, I take care of myself. I've launched a skin care line and it's 
going to be a huge business. It's an excellent line of skin care products. It 
has all the latest developments in it. It has nothing to do with what I look 
like, but I act as its spokesman. I own it, as a matter of fact. Why not 
capitalize on the fact that there's a guy who is 64 years old and looks pretty 
good for his age? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why hasn't your company produced successful dramatic series or situation 
comedies? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Situation comedies are a specialty area. If we had had the kind of money to 
spend on the creators, producers and writers, we could do it. I don't think 
that's a good way to invest the public's money because the odds are minimal 
that you'll succeed. We may get one on, but we're hanging on with bated breath 
for CBS to give us a nod one way or the other. It's a story of two teen idols, 
who happen to be real idols -- Frankie Avalon and Michael Damian. Frankie plays 
the father, Michael the son who gives up his teaching job to go into music, 
much to the dismay of his father, who is a former teen idol. It's a very, very 
funny premise. We did a run-through for CBS and they had us commission a 
script. You and I can relate to the older end of it, and those kids who are 
falling in love with the 8 o'clock shows will love the youthful end of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What have you not done? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'd like to launch a Broadway show because we failed twice. It's a part of 
the entertainment business I haven't quite licked yet. I'd like our company to 
have more regular series on so that we don't have to reinvent ourselves every 
few minutes, but in the meantime, being the most successful of what we do is 
not a bad mantle to carry.

WHOOPI! THERE IT IS: GOLDBERG TO HOST OSCARS; AWARDS: PERFORMER BREAKS NEW 
GROUND - FIRST WOMAN AND FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN AS SOLO MASTER OF CEREMONIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whoopi Goldberg was named Sunday to host this year's Academy Awards show, 
ending a difficult search to replace its previous popular master of ceremonies, 
Billy Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Crystal declined to front this year's event for a fifth straight year, 
one of the biggest guessing games in Hollywood was who producer Gil Cates would 
call upon. Cates was mum and would not confirm reports that such entertainers 
as Bette Midler, Johnny Carson, Tom Hanks and Steve Martin had also declined. 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran Oscar insider connected with a major studio said that the five 
nominees for best picture (which will be announced Wednesday morning) has been 
easier to predict than guessing who Cates would ultimately persuade to do the 
March 21 show. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her publicist, Goldberg said Sunday she is "thrilled about my date 
with Oscar. To go from watching to winning to hosting in one lifetime is 
major." The 44-year-old performer, currently shooting "Boys on the Side" in 
Pittsburgh, won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in the 1990 
romantic comedy, "Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of Goldberg is a departure for the Oscar show, where white males 
have predominated as masters of ceremonies. Not only will Goldberg be the first 
woman solo host, she also will be the show's first solo African American host. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a terrific choice and she'll do a wonderful job," Crystal said 
Sunday. "And I'm happy for her, the Academy and the fans of the show." Cates, 
who is in his fifth year producing the Oscar extravaganza, said Goldberg has 
"all the qualities of a great Oscar host," noting she is a highly recognizable 
star who has millions of fans. In an earlier interview, Cates told The Times, 
"I'll miss Billy. He was really wonderful. The parting was sad, but really 
amicable. I understand you do it for four years and it gets to be a grind. Last 
year they really struggled about how he would top his entrances of previous 
years. And I understand that problem. Each year I've said it's going to be my 
last, too." 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Crystal, Cates' "team" is returning: director Jeff 
Margolis, choreographer Debbie Allen and music director Tom Conti. Cates, the 
59-year-old dean of UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television, is an Emmy 
Award-winning producer who has directed for stage, TV and movies for more than 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In pointing to the importance of the host's role, Cates stresses the unique 
qualities of the Academy Awards presentations: "It's the oldest mass show in 
the country. It ties together events that have taken place all through the 
previous year. It's the reflection (of) how much impact movies and visual 
imagery have on our conscience. This is one of our culture's only mass events 
that appeals to children and grandparents alike." 
</P>
<P>
 One billion people worldwide are estimated to view the show. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The next event on the road to this year's Oscars is the Wednesday morning 
announcement of nominations.  
</P>
<P>
 Many film industry watchers believe the top film Oscar nominations will 
closely resemble the Directors Guild of America's field of five movies for its 
best director prize: "The Piano," "The Fugitive," "The Remains of the Day," 
"The Age of Innocence" and "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood film companies are poised to take advantage of the prestige and 
publicity that nominations can bring to a movie, and thus give a boost to 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The distributors of such likely Oscar-nominated movies as "The Piano," 
"Schindler's List" and "The Fugitive," among others, already have contingency 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're lucky enough to get the nomination," said Miramax Films co-chairman 
Harvey Weinstein, the distributor of "The Piano," "you'll see 300 more prints 
on screens by Friday," bringing the film's total to 800 prints. That would 
compare to the number of theaters Miramax had for "The Crying Game," its 1992 
multiple-nominated movie, at this time last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein said "The Crying Game" had grossed under $20 million and "The Piano" 
has taken in $24 million to date. But after its Oscar nominations, "The Crying 
Game" went on to reach $63 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, everyone recognizes that 'Schindler's List' is the favorite 
and a fantastic movie, but you never know," Weinstein said. "The race is just 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesperson for Warner Bros., which distributed "The Fugitive," said that 
no matter which way the nominations go, the popular summer film will be 
reissued nationally on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At Universal Pictures, the distributor of "Schindler's List," the plan had 
always been to slowly open the film from its December debut to the present.  
</P>
<P>
 "The public demand is reason enough to expand the movie," said Nikki Rocco, 
Universal senior vice president of distribution and marketing.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue increasing its play dates. We're in for a very long run." As 
of last weekend, the film was at 354 movie theaters, or the nation's top 150 
markets. By this Friday, it will be in 750 locations, Rocco said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nominations themselves will be revealed in front of 500 credentialed 
members of the news media at the pre-dawn hour of 5:30 in order to maximize 
publicity opportunities, timing the announcements for the East Coast-based 
morning talk shows.  
</P>
<P>
 The 8:30 a.m. segment of those network shows will carry the reading of the 
nominees by Academy president Arthur Hiller and 1992 supporting actress winner 
Marisa Tomei, live from the Beverly Hills headquarters of the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences.

MUSICAL 'FINDING HOME' IS COMING HOME TO SCR; STAGE: TOURING PRODUCTION WITH 
MESSAGE FOR YOUNGSTERS HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE COUNTY. IT WILL BE STAGED HERE 
TUESDAY AND IN APRIL. 
</P>

 A melting pot is fine if you're whipping up fondue. But asa way to mingle 
people of diverse cultures and values, well, the pot is basically a crock. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way Burger, the quintessential California surfer, sees things in 
"Finding Home," South Coast Repertory's 1994 Educational Touring Production. 
Written by Michael Bigelow Dixon and SCR dramaturge Jerry Patch with music by 
Diane King Vann, "Finding Home" takes Burger's struggle to fit into an 
unfamiliar culture without sacrificing his own identity, and uses it as a 
parable to acquaint children with the challenges faced by local immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding Home," which is intended for kindergarten through sixth-graders, 
recently began a four-month tour of Southland schools backed by a grant from 
the Mervyn's/Dayton-Hudson Foundation, underwriter of the Touring Project for 
the past 15 years. Two free performances for the public are scheduled: Tuesday 
at 4:30 p.m. on the SCR Mainstage and April 30 at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center as part of the annual Imagination Celebration. For Tuesday's show, 
reservations are suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical premiered in 1984 and has been touted by SCR officials as the most 
talked-about show in the Touring Project's 25-year history. The primary reason, 
they say, is that until "Finding Home," the touring shows centered on larger, 
external themes and issues such as communication, fitness and the computer age, 
and this show turned the focus inward, exploring the impact of immigration on a 
young person's emotions. Such subsequent shows as "Face 2 Face," which examined 
peer pressure, and last year's "My Mom's Dad," a musical study in 
intergenerational strife, continued the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Patch (co-author Dixon, a former literary staff member who left 
SCR in the mid-'80s, was not involved in the revisions), the current version of 
"Finding Home" differs only slightly from the original: A new song was written 
for the finale, the musical style was funkified here and there, and the 
dialogue was fine-tuned to keep up with current jargon. And yes, in case you 
remember the original and were wondering about them, those wacky vegetable hats 
are still there, although designer Dwight Richard Odle has broadened the 
we-are-all-growing-in-the-same-garden theme with the addition of more diverse 
wearable flora. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 45-minute show, Burger rides a monster wave to the unknown and not 
entirely welcoming shores of Aboland, where he must navigate language, rituals 
and customs that are, like, totally foreign. And, because the natives are big 
on conformity, Burger ultimately must decide whether he will jump into the 
official Aboland melting pot or hang on to his own surfer dude identity. 
</P>
<P>
 As Patch points out, the subject of immigration and assimilation is more of a 
headline-maker today as it was in the early '80s. According to census figures 
compiled by the County of Orange Department of Immigration, more than 63,000 
documented foreign-born residents entered the county between 1982 and 1984, 
while more than 122,000 entered between 1987 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding Home" has been directed by John-David Keller, the SCR resident actor 
and director who has been staging the touring shows for 23 years, and it 
features four professional actors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keller said "Finding Home" is less about immigration per se as it is about 
values of tolerance between people of all ages and cultures. "If we can express 
to children of elementary-school age a message of tolerance for people who are 
different, then we are hitting the right note at the right age," he said. "The 
basic message is that various cultures can exist harmoniously together, rather 
than just be assimilated into our culture. 
</P>
<P>
 He paused, then added with a laugh, "Whatever that is." 
</P>
<P>
 As a companion project to "Finding Home" in 1984, SCR released "Second Lives," 
a book of interviews with recent immigrants, most of them Asian or Hispanic. 
Before Tuesday's show, two of those interviewees, Chu (Vu) Collins and Mouachou 
Mounanoutoua, Laotians now employed as county social workers, will conduct a 
seminar, along with a representative from the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, an elementary school principal and Keller. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Finding Home," South Coast Repertory's 1994 Educational Touring Production, 
will be performed Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. on the SCR Mainstage, 655 Town Center 
Drive, Costa Mesa. Also April 30 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, as part of the annual Imagination 
Celebration. Both performances will be free. For reservations for Tuesday's 
show, call (714) 957-2602.

NEWPORT HARBOR WILL OPEN 4-WEEK WELLES RETROSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The Newport Harbor Art Museum is offering a four-week retrospective of Orson 
Welles, one of America's greatest filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The series starts Friday at 6:30 p.m. with Welles' acknowledged masterpiece of 
American success and regret, "Citizen Kane" (1941), with Welles as an enigmatic 
newspaper tycoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Up next, Feb. 18, is "Lady From Shanghai" (1948), a thriller in which Welles 
plays an adventurer who hooks up with a cripple (Everett Sloan) and his 
beautiful wife (Rita Hayworth). 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 24 brings "Touch of Evil" (1958), a cult favorite in which Welles is a 
dirty cop who tangles with a narcotics agent (Charlton Heston) in a rough 
Mexican border town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Trial," one of Welles' more ambitious movies, will be shown March 4. This 
adaptation of Kafka's famous existential novel stars Anthony Perkins as the 
confused Everyman caught up in a maddeningly obtuse and dangerous judicial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Taussig, who teaches film classes at Orange Coast College and writes a 
newsletter called "The Film Analyst," will introduce each movie and will 
discuss them afterward. Taussig has hosted similar programs on vampire flicks 
and the films of Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Citizen Kane" by Orson Welles will be shown Friday at 6:30 p.m. at the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. $3 for museum 
members, seniors and students; $5 for the public. (714) 759-1122.

 CRUNCH TIME: League titles and playoff berths are at stake in this final week 
of prep basketball's regular season. . . . Orange County has two of the 
nation's top teams -- the Mater Dei boys are ranked fourth, the Brea-Olinda 
girls fifth -- and is expected to contend for state titles. . . . Looking to 
shake up the status quo is Orange, which in 1920 became the county's first 
state champion. But it might be tough for the Panthers, ranked third in the 
county; they're in the same division as Mater Dei and lost an earlier meeting, 
69-30. "We're not really concerned about it," Coach Richard Bossenmeyer said. 
"Our goal has been to win the Century League . . . then we'll worry about the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 NOT SO FAST: Unlike the pros, boys' basketball does not have a time limit for 
attempting a shot, which coaches like Capistrano Valley's Mark Thornton 
appreciate. . . . In an effort to keep a recent game with Mater Dei close, 
Thornton's Cougars held the ball for long stretches without shooting and still 
lost by 24 points. Said Thornton: "You want to see a shot clock, so we have to 
run up and down the court with those guys? They'd score 1,000 points." Mater 
Dei Coach Gary McKnight called the stalling tactics a mere nuisance and 
quipped: "I'd love to see a 15-second shot clock." 
</P>
<P>
 ALL KEYED UP: Newport Harbor senior Genevieve Evarts began playing piano at 
age 4, and says it has helped her in basketball. The Sailors' leading scorer 
competed in recitals worldwide until her freshman year. "Here on the basketball 
court, you're dealing with the same kind of pressure -- of having to perform 
well and finish the performance no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 TOUGH TEAM: Perhaps no girls' team has handled adversity as well as Fountain 
Valley. The Barons didn't practice in their own gym until Jan. 3, because it 
was being repaired after vandals flooded it. And they won a tournament without 
Coach Carol Strausburg, who was attending her mother's funeral in Ohio. . . . 
Still, the team of mostly juniors and sophomores is No. 7 in the county. Said 
Strausburg: "We've gotten more out of this team than anyone thought we would."

 THROUGH TRAFFIC: The westbound ramps of Kimball Road to the Santa Paula 
Freeway are now open, ending months of delays, detours and drivers' 
frustrations in Ventura. The ramps were closed as part of a road-widening 
project. . . . "Nobody likes being frustrated by traffic congestion, so we're 
happy to have the on- and off-ramps open again," city spokesman Stephen 
Hartmann said. . . . Now to pay for the roadwork: City officials estimate the 
widening project will cost taxpayers $6.5 million more than originally 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 PREPARE TO SLOW: While one traffic headache has been solved, other problems 
persist in Ventura County. . . . In Moorpark, a new traffic signal is causing 
concern. In Oak View, motorists complain about a bottleneck along California 
33. And in Thousand Oaks, there is discussion about the proper technique for 
merging into the bike lane. . . . Street Smart (B1) considers the questions and 
comes up with answers. 
</P>
<P>
 HANDCRAFTED: You can't find them in the phone book. Don't look for them at art 
shows. Ventura County woodworkers hone their skills in small shops and tiny 
garages, scratching out a living in an age of manufactured cabinets (B1). . . . 
Most are 40-something and college-educated in disciplines they've abandoned to 
work with their hands. . . . "The nature of people who get involved in this 
sort of thing is that they like to paddle their own canoe," woodworker Bruce 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 GRAFFITI PATROL: Police Detective Steve Vendt has been named Oxnard's new 
anti-graffiti officer, replacing Officer James E. O'Brien, who was killed in 
the line of duty. . . . Vendt, 39, is a 10-year department veteran who helps 
provide police experience to youngsters interested in law enforcement careers. 
. . . "Jim did such a good job and made such a dent, we weren't about to let 
things revert back to the way they were," police spokesman David Keith said. 
"I'm sure Steve will do a real good job."

STREET SMART: HOW TO AVOID TRAFFIC AND ARRIVE SMILING: BIKE TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Editor's note: In Southern California, the connection between resident and 
automobile is almost mythic. But much has happened to change the commuting 
landscape: unbridled growth, increasing traffic congestion and now the 
disruptions after a disastrous earthquake. This new weekly feature highlights 
the travails and triumphs of getting around Los Angeles in a new era of 
transportation.  
</P>
<P>
 Julie Hassan greets the morning sun somewhere around Marina del Rey as it 
sneaks above the snowcapped San Gabriel Mountains and peeks through a billowing 
canopy of pink and purple clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this part," said Hassan, 32, the chilled morning air snapping at her 
cheeks and ears as she pedals her 18-speed bicycle over a Ballona Creek bridge. 
"It feels great to have the wind blowing in your face." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Hassan's morning commute, a particularly enviable trip in post-quake 
Los Angeles: An invigorating 15 1/2 miles along the surf and sand between her 
home in Manhattan Beach and her office at Santa Monica City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan's daily trip takes 45 minutes as she whizzes past the early morning 
crowd of joggers and other cyclists. The same trip in an automobile recently 
took an hour -- a gear-grinding, teeth-gnashing pilgrimage along clogged 
streets and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "My co-workers are already frustrated when they get into the office and then 
they head straight to the coffee machine," said Hassan, an investigator in the 
Santa Monica city attorney's office. "I come in and I feel good. I think I look 
good. The blood is circulating. It's very rejuvenating." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the millions who make the daily schlep in Los Angeles County, Hassan is 
among the 1% who hop on their two-wheelers and actually look forward to the 
trip to work. With some of the world's busiest freeways knocked out of 
commission by the Jan. 17 Northridge quake, thousands of commuters are looking 
for ways to get out of their cars. Bicycle enthusiasts like Hassan believe they 
have the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning after the 6.6 temblor -- while most of her co-workers fretted 
alone in their cars -- Hassan rode to work as usual along the ocean bike path. 
No way she was going to fight traffic. "I just felt safer on the bike path," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan's daily ride begins shortly after 6 a.m. when it is dark and still and 
cold. Two battery-powered lights mounted on the handlebars cut through the 
dark, and an ensemble of color-coordinated Lycra keeps out the cold. The 
constant whir of the derailleur is the only sound as she pedals through 
deserted streets to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading north along the beach, she clips along at a respectable 20 m.p.h. past 
the Hyperion sewage treatment plant. ("When the wind blows the wrong way, it 
smells pretty bad.") Past Los Angeles International Airport. Past the toy boats 
of the rich and famous in Marina del Rey. Past the bakeries along Santa 
Monica's Main Street ("That place has great coffee.") And finally to City Hall, 
where she showers and changes and reports to work by 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Most mornings for four years, this has been the routine for Hassan, who used 
to compete in triathlons and runs two marathons every year. Part of the reason 
she took her job was because Santa Monica encourages employees to commute in 
alternative ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sort of put us on a pedestal," Hassan said. City employees are paid $1 
for every day they ride their bikes to work, and there is a waiting list for 
bike lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some private employers also try to entice workers out of their cars. 
Prudential Insurance in Woodland Hills offers employees free membership to the 
company gym and will pay half the purchase price of a bicycle to workers who 
commute by bike two weeks a month for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle commuting may not be an option for Palmdale commuters, unless they are 
commuting to, well, Palmdale. But transportation planners hope people will 
learn to live near work, and thus be willing to hop on a bike or just hoof it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the earthquake has created an awareness that our transit system, as 
it is structured now, is dependent on the single-occupant automobile," said 
Paul Tay, bicycle coordinator for the city of Los Angeles. "Any one of those 
shakes could bring the whole thing down." 
</P>
<P>
 Tay jokingly said the freeways could be put to better use by two-wheelers: 
"We've already built a wonderful bicycle path system," he said. "The problem is 
there are too many cars on them." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, new buildings bigger than 50,000 square feet are required to 
provide bicycle parking and employee showers. Even so, Ryan Snyder, a bicycle 
planning consultant, estimates that fewer than 20% of companies offer 
facilities to encourage bike commuting. "It's not nearly enough," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, few people feel safe riding their bikes on streets filled with 
hostile or inattentive motorists. Surprisingly, perhaps, Bicycle magazine rated 
Los Angeles in the top 10 bicycle-friendly U.S. cities -- something Snyder 
attributes to the wide streets and pleasant weather. 
</P>
<P>
 But if bike commuting is to become more common -- in some Dutch cities, 30% of 
all trips are made on bicycle -- Snyder said much more needs to be done: more 
bike lanes and more links with other forms of transit, such as trains and 
buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those projects are under way and many more are expected to begin in 
the coming months and years, Tay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of reasons people should consider an auto-less lifestyle," he 
said. "Even in Los Angeles, especially in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Tay does not own a car. Julie Hassan does, and she does put mileage on it. Her 
weekly average? Five. Bicycle Commuting 
</P>
<P>
 * Bicycle commuting requires more than just hopping on the old three-speed and 
heading for work. Long-time riders say the right equipment can make all the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * A helmet is a must. 
</P>
<P>
 * Headlights, taillights and reflectors make riders more visible in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stiff-soled shoes make riding more comfortable and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clothing designed for cycling -- especially spandex shorts and padded gloves 
-- makes rides more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 * A rear-view mirror attached to the handlebars or helmet allows a bicyclist 
to see what is coming up from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bicycle luggage ranges from simple backpacks to bags that keep business 
suits neat. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the road, it is important to play it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ride in a straight line and use hand signals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always ride with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Obey all traffic signs and signals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't weave between parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay alert for cars, pedestrians and other hazards.

ELECTIONS / MOORPARK; FIELDS STILL SMALL IN MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL RACES; 
POLITICS: LAWRASON, HOPING FOR ANOTHER TERM, SAYS 'A LOT IS HAPPENING IN THE 
CITY.' MANY FAMILIAR FIGURES PLAN TO SIT OUT THIS CAMPAIGN. 
</P>

<P>
 A majority of Moorpark City Council seats will be up for grabs when residents 
go to the polls later this year, and incumbents and challengers are already 
mulling council and mayoral bids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely, I am going to run for the office again," said Mayor Paul 
Lawrason, who is 65. "A lot is happening in the city. We're on the edge of a 
lot of things and I would like to be around to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bernardo Perez, initially elected to the council in 1988 and its 
only Latino member, also plans to seek reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoy working for the community in that role," he said. "I really 
enjoy the very local level of public service." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Wozniak, a former planning and parks commissioner elected to 
the council in 1990, said the end of his first term will cap a 14-year career 
in city government and might be the time to bow out of local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point you have to draw the line and say, 'That's enough,' " said 
Wozniak, 46, who recently found a job with the Moorpark Unified School District 
after being unemployed for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to get a job and then say, 'Oh, by the way, I do this and I 
need this time off and I need to go to these meetings,' " Wozniak said. "At 
this point it would be a coin toss. I haven't even sat down with the family yet 
to discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Scott Montgomery and Pat Hunter -- the top vote-getters in the last 
council race two years ago, have two years left in their terms. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery may still be politically active this year. He is considering a 
run for County Supervisor Vicky Howard's seat or possibly contesting Lawrason's 
mayoral bid. Montgomery expects to announce his intentions within the next few 
weeks. But he said he already considers a faceoff with Lawrason extremely 
unlikely, preferring to run for a political office that carries a four-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The likelihood that I would run for mayor is very, very small," he said. "The 
biggest problem is it's a two-year term. . . . I think it's unfair that whoever 
is in that position has to run every two years." 
</P>
<P>
 One potential council candidate is former Councilman Roy Talley, who in 1992 
lost his council seat after finishing only 50 votes behind Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 "After watching the council for the past year, I think I need to be back," 
Talley said. "There are a lot of things that can be done in the community and I 
still feel like I have something to contribute, so I'll just have to see how I 
feel when it gets closer to filing time." 
</P>
<P>
 Talley won a special election in 1991 to serve out the remainder of Lawrason's 
first term on the council after Lawrason became the city's first elected mayor 
midway through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said that coming so close to losing his council seat showed him how much 
he valued it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That election really helped me see how much I appreciated being a member of 
the City Council," said Perez, who blamed his poor finish on his own lazy 
campaign efforts. "It wasn't a matter of anything that I did wrong, it was a 
matter of I didn't do anything. . . . I will never again be in danger of 
becoming complacent in my election campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential challenger is Planning Commissioner Mike Wesner. Wesner, who 
has served on the commission since 1990, said he is interested in joining the 
council but is unsure if he wants to take on the time commitment, including 
several meetings a week and other duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sitting here evaluating whether I can invest the time in the City Council 
for four years," Wesner said. "I've got to sit down with my wife and say, 
'Well, this is a four-year commitment, what do you want to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wesner plans to make his decision by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who eventually decides to run, this year's Moorpark race may be 
significantly shaped by the fact that candidates who have spiced up local 
politics in the past plan to avoid this year's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Former councilwoman and frequent council critic Eloise Brown, who has run for 
city office three times since losing her seat in 1990, said she does not intend 
another bid in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really am having a wonderful time with what I'm doing," Brown said of her 
role as Moorpark's most active gadfly. "This way, I can irritate both the 
council and the school board." 
</P>
<P>
 And, former councilman and current school board member Clint Harper, a 
slow-growth advocate who has clashed with Lawrason and Montgomery, said he has 
no plans to vie for a council seat this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Steve Brodsky said he recently considered running for 
one of the open council seats but decided to concentrate on business and family 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Bart Miller was rumored to be considering a mayoral bid, but he 
said that Lawrason's decision to run again will keep him on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to put all my energy into reelecting Paul Lawrason," Miller said. 
"I think he's doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Wesner and other officials said the lack of willing council candidates is not 
surprising. "People have begun to realize that it's a boring, tedious job," 
Wesner said. "It's thankless and you're always wrong. I think people are really 
asking themselves, 'Why would I want to get involved in that for four years?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And while Wozniak is wondering whether to run at all, Lawrason finds himself 
left to wonder who -- if anyone -- will challenge him. No clear opposition has 
emerged, and his major foe last time around -- staunch conservative Helen 
Taylor -- said she has no plans to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past years, you could kind of pick out who the candidates would be. I 
can't do that now," Lawrason said. "We're not being followed in recent months 
by vocal, obvious groups who have a leader who might run." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said he is not surprised or concerned by the lack of council or mayoral 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first response to so few names would be, 'Whew!' We're still a long way 
from filing, though."

STREET SMART: DRIVERS SHOULD GET INTO HABIT OF SIGNALING LANE CHANGES, TURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, a young man in a jeep darted in front of me during my daily 
commute on the San Diego Freeway. He failed to signal his lane change. 
</P>
<P>
 I was going 60 miles per hour and braked sharply to avoid hitting him. This 
caused cars behind me to hit their brakes, which could have caused a multiple 
car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 I would estimate that approximately 80% of my fellow freeway drivers do not 
use their turn signals, and often tailgate.  
</P>
<P>
 This group seems to consist of both men and women in their mid-20s to mid-40s. 
I can't understand this phenomenon because these drivers are supposed to have 
benefited from formal driver education. Is this condition unique to Southern 
California? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard M. Vogel 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 No one has ever accused California drivers of being overly polite, but the 
business of changing lanes without signaling is not unique to the southern 
portion of this state. No statistics are kept on collisions caused by unsafe 
lane changes, but the dangerous practice is common across the country, said 
Steve Kohler, a California Highway Patrol officer and agency spokesman in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "People everywhere are not as courteous or thoughtful as they used to be on 
the road," Kohler said. "Not signaling for a lane change or a turn has just 
become a bad habit people have gotten into." 
</P>
<P>
 As with any new habit, it would take just three to four weeks of 
conscientiously using turn signals for lane changes and turns to become 
accustomed to the practice, Kohler said. The process can also work in reverse: 
If you don't use your turn signals for a few weeks, you get out of the habit, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, to all motorists out there: Use those turn signals. You can add this 
resolution to all the other New Year's promises you are trying to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Why is there no entrance to the car-pool lane at the convergence of the Garden 
Grove Freeway and Costa Mesa Freeway south? The on-ramp is beyond the nearest 
exit and the next entrance is not until 17th Street, a very congested area 
between the Garden Grove Freeway and the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Markson 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Recently the entrance / exit of the car-pool lane on the southbound Costa Mesa 
Freeway was changed to accommodate the final design of the improved Santa Ana / 
Costa Mesa freeway interchange, said Caltrans spokeswoman Rose Orem.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans eliminated one entrance / exit and added two locations to access the 
car-pool lane, Orem said. A new entrance / exit was added at the Costa Mesa / 
Garden Grove freeway interchange and will accommodate motorists wishing to exit 
at 17th and 4th streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The access located just north of 17th Street was originally an entrance only 
to the car-pool lane, Orem said. It was moved 1,200 feet south because 
motorists were leaving the car-pool lane and attempting to exit at the 17th 
Street off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 This change was to improve the operation of the freeway by allowing vehicles 
more distance to change lanes before traveling through the Santa Ana / Costa 
Mesa freeway interchange, which is currently under construction, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the congestion in that area of the freeway is because of the current 
construction, which should be alleviated with the completion of the interchange 
project in late 1995, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular riders of the Orange County Transportation Authority's Commuter Rail 
train service must send in their bonus ticket applications by Feb. 15. The 
commuter rail bonus ticket program is set to end March 28, when Metrolink 
commuter train service begins serving Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonus ticket program was designed to encourage ridership on OCTA's daily 
round-trip train between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles. To receive bonus 
tickets, regular riders who normally purchase 10-trip tickets can mail in four 
10-trip ticket receipts and receive eight one-way tickets at no charge. Monthly 
requests for the bonus tickets have usually numbered between 140 and 160.  
</P>
<P>
 The transition to Metrolink service on March 28 will mean an end for the 
program because of Metrolink's lower fares and added trains. Bonus tickets will 
be accepted on OCTA's commuter rail train until March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonus tickets can be redeemed by mailing four 10-trip ticket receipts to the 
Orange County Transportation Authority, Commuter Rail Bonus Ticket Program, 550 
S. Main St., P.O. Box 14184, Orange, Calif. 92613-1584. Riders can also receive 
more information by calling (714) 636-RIDE.

OWNER OF HOUSE DESTROYED IN PLANE CRASH CALLS CITY ACTION A DISASTER; SANTA 
PAULA: NEW ZONING LAWS WON'T LET HIM REBUILD, BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO MONEY 
TO PAY HIM FOR PROPERTY. HE SAYS INSURANCE OFFERS ARE TOO LOW.

 Joe Garcia knows about disasters, bureaucrats and insurance companies. And the 
73-year-old retired carpenter has nothing good to say about any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 18 months since an airplane dropped out of the sky and destroyed one of 
his modest houses near Santa Paula Airport, Garcia said he has watched 
insurance companies wiggle out of responsibilities and city bureaucrats adopt 
rules that forbid him from rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders say they want to buy his house and all of his neighbors' houses 
too for a newly designated safety zone around the airport. But there's a catch. 
The city has no money. 
</P>
<P>
 So a house Garcia owns and a neighboring house remain blackened, hollow 
shells, appearing the same as they did when firefighters put out the blaze that 
killed the pilot of the downed plane in August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who lives next to the two burned-out buildings in the home he built 
with his wife, said he's becoming desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm about fed up and I don't know what I'll do next," he said recently while 
walking through one of the ruined structures. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the stress has him smoking and cursing more than he did when he was a 
soldier in North Africa during World War II. He's gone so far as to say that it 
would have been better if he had died in the fiery Aug. 27 crash "just to be 
over with this mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 18 months ago, a plane headed for the airport was clipped by another 
plane, lost control and plowed into the two houses at Santa Clara and Oak 
streets on the south side of Santa Paula. The plane burst into flames and 
burned the house owned by Garcia and a house owned by Rafael Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he was offered $49,000 by the insurance company representing the 
pilot, the airport and the company that owned the airplane. The sum, an 
insurance adjuster assured him, should cover his destroyed house and emotional 
stress he has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "What am I going to do with their $49,000?" Garcia said. "You can't even buy 
an outhouse with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Garcia receives enough money to rebuild, the city has forbidden Garcia 
and Rodriguez from so much as erecting a wall in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the Santa Paula City Council decided to prohibit construction in 
a newly established safety zone around the airport, stopping Garcia's plans to 
redo the gutted house. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, city leaders said they were willing to buy Garcia's property, 
but the cash-strapped city has no money for the purchase. More than a year ago, 
the city applied for a state grant to buy both properties, but the grant has 
yet to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been 18 months, and they haven't produced a damn thing. They all make it 
seem like it was our fault, like our house jumped up into the sky and hit that 
plane," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia has lived next to the airport since 1948. He said he is convinced that 
the insurance companies are holding out, waiting for him to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got that solved. I'm gonna give my sons power of attorney so if I die, they 
can take the damn thing over," he said, lighting his second cigarette in less 
than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia is grateful that neither his son nor anyone else in the house next door 
was injured in the crash. His 48-year-old son Daniel was renting the house at 
the time. Daniel Garcia was watching television with his wife, son and son's 
girlfriend when the plane crashed through the roof and caved in the far side of 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of ignoring the threat from above, Joe Garcia said he now finds 
himself worried about living next to an airport with no control tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still get nervous when I hear planes landing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was renting the other burned house to Jose Perez and his family. 
Perez was working in the yard and his two sons were in the house playing when 
the plane hit. Gas from the planes fuselage ignited both houses, but the 
families escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are all suing. Rodriguez, the Garcia family and the Perez family have 
joined a lawsuit demanding more than $5 million in damages from the city, the 
airport, the two airplane companies that owned the planes involved in the crash 
and the insurance companies representing the pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcias are asking for enough money to replace their destroyed home and 
lost belongings. They are also asking for compensation for emotional distress, 
as is Jose Perez and his family. Rodriguez said he wants enough money to buy a 
comparable house elsewhere, out of the flight path. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the stress claim focuses on those who witnessed the pilot trapped in 
the cockpit burn to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Garcia said he was within a few feet of reaching the pilot before the 
plane caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was alive," Daniel Garcia said. "I saw him. He was looking at me yelling 
and then it just burst into flames. I can still see his face. He died a 
horrible death. I wonder, if we were able to save him, if all this would have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is haunted by nightmares of the accident. His lawyers are asking 
for $2.5 million for his emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 When Joe Garcia heard the crash, he ran over to help his son and his family. 
He was standing behind Daniel when the plane burst into flames. While his son 
started spraying the fire with a garden hose, Joe Garcia grabbed a downed power 
line that had fallen near his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it had electrocuted me just so I wouldn't have had to go through all 
this," Joe Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's lawyers are asking for $300,000 for emotional distress and another 
$187,000 to replace the home that he owned and depended upon for rental income. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers defending the insurance companies said the claims by the Garcia 
family, Perez family and Rodriguez have no basis in law. They have offered to 
repay the value of the houses -- assessed at roughly $20,000 each -- and no 
more than $1,000 for emotional distress, one attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping for an early and fair resolution," said Mitch Green, a Santa 
Monica-based attorney representing insurance companies of the pilot killed in 
the crash and the owner of the plane. Green declined further comment on the 
lawsuit, scheduled for trial in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their attitude is mind-boggling to me," said John Brown, an Oxnard attorney 
representing the Garcias. "I don't mean to sound emotional, but they're trying 
to bury these people in paper. They're treating them shamefully, and they want 
to string the case along because Joe and Mr. Rodriguez are both over 70."

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TARGET GREENBELT; VENTURA: TWO PROPOSALS WOULD CARVE UP 
PROTECTED AGRICULTURAL BUFFER. SEVERAL COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Avocado orchards, lemon groves and celery fields spread across hundred of 
acres of open space that break up the rows of tract houses in eastern Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 A reminder of the city's agricultural roots, these 900 acres of farmland 
stretching from Foothill Road to the Santa Clara River are protected from 
development until the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 But proposals from two of the area's largest landowners threaten the longevity 
of the agricultural buffer set forth in the city's Comprehensive Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In about a week, the Ventura City Council is scheduled to consider preliminary 
review of two proposed projects that, if approved, would carve up the greenbelt 
established by a previous council in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 One developer wants to build 815 houses and condominiums on a fragrant lemon 
orchard. Another proposes building a park on about 90 acres of celery fields in 
exchange for being allowed to build houses on agricultural land at the city's 
east end. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Ventura's Comprehensive Plan, these proposals would not be allowed 
because the agricultural zoning for the east Ventura greenbelt is off-limits 
until the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 But the majority on the Ventura City Council has shifted philosophically over 
the two most recent elections. The council that was controlled by 
environmentalists is now dominated by business boosters. And, several members 
on the current pro-growth council have expressed interest in the proposals to 
begin developing the greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Richard Francis, who helped establish the greenbelt when he was 
on the council four years ago, said the agricultural buffer is unique in that 
part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like protecting virginity," he said. "You keep saying no, but you only 
have to say yes once. It is the last large contiguous area of open space left 
in the city. Developers have been eyeing it for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the east Ventura greenbelt is county land. But it is surrounded 
by city boundaries and could be annexed at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Jones and Ron Hertel, the developers who want to build in the greenbelt, 
contend that their projects will benefit the city and say their proposals 
should receive serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel is suggesting swapping his 92 acres in the greenbelt for 87 acres of 
city-owned land at Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue. The Ventura-based developer 
wants to build single-family homes on the city-owned land. In exchange, he 
would give the city $2 million to build a park on the land he owns at Telephone 
and Kimball roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a traffic and access standpoint, my land is clearly a better location 
for a regional park," Hertel said. "I contend that this will give the city a 
legitimate foothold into the inner-city greenbelt." 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel said if a park is built on his land, it would still be considered 
open-space area and would not violate the spirit of the greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, who chairs the City Council's housing 
subcommittee that would review Hertel's proposal, is enthusiastic about the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the Hertel swap as a golden, one-time opportunity," Measures said. 
"We're looking at youth programs as being a priority on the council, and a park 
would fulfill that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Gary Tuttle, who was reelected last year on an environmental 
platform, noted that Hertel's proposal would mean allowing the developer to 
build on land zoned for agriculture. Hertel would not be allowed to develop on 
his land until 2010, and the city's land is also designated agricultural. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any way you cut it, you lose open space," Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it involves developing a park, Hertel's suggestion has not drawn as 
much ire from environmentalists as Jones' proposed residential project. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, in partnership with the property owner Limco Del Mar Ltd., wants to 
build a large complex of residential and commercial buildings with parks and 
bike paths on 222 acres between Foothill and Telegraph roads, just east of Hill 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones noted that the area is surrounded by residential neighborhoods on three 
sides and is ripe for development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're proposing something real exciting," Jones said. "This will have 
a village center that will offer community amenities like an amphitheater. It's 
something that would be a real asset to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Monahan, a consistent proponent of development, said he plans 
to seriously consider Jones' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 A major development in that area would mean adding more roads and widening 
Foothill Road, Monahan said. "It would improve the circulation plan of the 
area, and provide housing closer to the schools in the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say Jones' proposal would be a significant erosion of the greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hertel project is not so bad because it preserves some open space, but 
the Jones project is a serious assault," Francis said. "I think there will be a 
strong inclination to allow projects to go forward in spite of the 
Comprehensive Plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilwoman Cathy Bean, an east Ventura resident who has long favored 
preserving agricultural land and open space, mourned the potential inroads into 
the greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 "East Ventura is already a sea of houses," Bean said. "This would destroy the 
semirural ambience of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Bean predicted the greenbelt will fall to development interests. She said the 
makeup of the current seven-member council is decidedly pro-growth, and 
remaining environmentalists Tuttle and Steve Bennett do not hold enough clout 
to stop the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got the votes," Bean said of the pro-growth majority. "Unless the 
people get into an uproar, they'll cover up every square inch of farmland." 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Tuttle and Bennett -- both of whom express reservations 
about breaking up the east Ventura greenbelt -- no formal opposition to the 
development proposals has emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said the city's environmental interests are not yet aware of the 
threat to the greenbelt and have yet to organize any significant opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff kind of ferments behind the scenes," Bennett said. "This is coming 
up fast. The developers are trying to push their projects forward now." 
</P>
<P>
 The two moderates on the council, Mayor Tom Buford and Councilman Gregory L. 
Carson, also expressed reservations about Jones' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson noted that several housing developments on the city's east end have not 
been finished because the real estate market has fallen and demand for housing 
has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford said developers have the right to ask for changes to the Comprehensive 
Plan, but added, "it should not be lightly regarded by anybody. It would take a 
lot to convince me to move out of our plan." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few months, the council is scheduled to vote on whether to change 
the Comprehensive Plan to consider Hertel's land swap and will decide whether 
to allocate housing units to Jones and Hertel. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Everett Millais said none of the other property 
owners in the greenbelt have come forward with development proposals. But when 
the greenbelt was established in 1989, a majority of the them objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all wanted it to be zoned for some kind of urban use," Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jack Tingstrom, who was elected on a pro-business platform, said 
property owners should have the right to develop their land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economically," he said, "you don't want to stop the growth of the city."

COMMUNITY NETWORKING; THOUSAND OAKS: ROTARY MEMBERS TRADE INFORMATION, AID 
CHARITIES. MORE WOMEN AND YOUNG PEOPLE ARE JOINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Every Wednesday at noon, patrons of the Westlake Inn restaurant find their 
lunchtime conversation briefly interrupted by singing coming from behind a door 
in the far corner of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The same sounds are heard on Thursdays by diners at Howard Johnson's and on 
Fridays by those sipping coffee before a round of golf at the North Ranch 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind those doors, a powerful group of men and women from nearly every 
profession and corner of Thousand Oaks pledge allegiance to the flag, sing 
"America the Beautiful," share gossip, plan charity fund-raisers and remain in 
touch and involved, all as part of their membership in the Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the largest service clubs in the county, Rotary has gained popularity in 
the Thousand Oaks area, where about 280 people are members of six separate 
Rotary chapters. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs have not only raised thousands of dollars annually for regional 
charities, they also have blossomed as the city's underground information 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday in Thousand Oaks, a representative from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency stopped by to share information on the earthquake relief 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to help people get on their feet, but there's a lot of misinformation 
out there," FEMA volunteer Mike Cavannaugh told the group. "I've come here 
because I need apostles out there to squelch the rumors and get accurate 
information out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rotarians, including two announced candidates for the county Board of 
Supervisors and one candidate for the Thousand Oaks City Council, listened 
closely for details. Business executives scribbled notes and gathered handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to know what's going on," said Warde Dixon, a local businessman who 
volunteers for the Red Cross. "We get the facts and then we can share them with 
the people we know." 
</P>
<P>
 At another recent meeting, the architect planning a major development in 
Thousand Oaks presented his ideas to the members. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you want to float an idea or get reaction to a project, the Rotary Club 
is the place to go," said Francisco Behr, the architect for the Seventh-day 
Adventist church development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd much rather get reaction there than wait to hear all the complaints at a 
public hearing when we're well into the project." 
</P>
<P>
 And, because there are developers and planning commissioners and City Council 
members at the meetings, Behr said the Rotary Club is an ideal place to get 
that reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Members are selected based in part on their standing in the community, 
according to James Hawkins, a Thousand Oaks attorney who will become the Rotary 
district governor for this county in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for a diverse group of leaders from every section of the 
business community," he said. "That's been the point of Rotary right from the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Rotary began in 1905 in Chicago by a group of businessmen who were new in the 
city and wanted to learn more about other peoples' professions, Hawkins said. 
The club is so named because meetings rotated each week from one member's 
office to another's. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotary has grown to include 25,000 chapters and 1.25 million members 
worldwide, Hawkins said. For its largest project, the clubs raised more than 
$300 million to fight polio, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past several years, Rotary members said the club has become more 
inclusive, recruiting women and younger people. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotary member Sherry Scott, a funeral director in Ventura, said that women 
have been welcomed and their numbers are growing steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women in our club work damn hard," Scott said. "I feel as comfortable 
here as I could possibly be." 
</P>
<P>
 Young people, too, are joining the clubs in increasing numbers, Hawkins said. 
But to attract younger members, Rotary has had to move meeting times to earlier 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "For one thing," Hawkins said, "the dinner meetings often involved drinking, 
and it's clear to me that the days of attracting top business people by blowing 
a lot of smoke and alcohol in their face are over." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Rotary has created Sunrise clubs to allow commuters and people with 
families to meet before work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake Sunrise club is one of the six chapters in the Thousand Oaks 
area. The others are the Thousand Oaks chapter, the Newbury Park chapter, the 
Conejo Valley chapter, the Westlake chapter and the Agoura Hills chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Friday morning at 7 a.m., the 40 members of the Westlake Sunrise 
chapter, most of them in their 30s and 40s, stroll into the North Ranch Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a hot cup of coffee and a plate of eggs and fruit, members tell jokes, 
read limericks and levy fines for offenses such as having "slimy hands" or 
coming in late. The fines, usually about $10, go into the club's fund for local 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar system is in place in the Thousand Oaks chapter, the largest with 
108 members. 
</P>
<P>
 There, fines are levied for ugly ties or for not knowing who won the Most 
Valuable Player award in the first Super Bowl. (It was Bart Starr.) One member 
had to forfeit $10 "because he's weird." 
</P>
<P>
 The money from the Thousand Oaks chapter, when combined with fund-raising 
efforts, amounted to $45,000 in gifts to several dozen local charities, said 
Hugo Roche, president of the Thousand Oaks chapter. The six clubs combined 
raised nearly $200,000 last year, according to Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty incredible what we've been able to accomplish even during these 
tough times," Roche said. "And what's more, I think we have a growing role to 
play in the community the more and more people become reliant on service 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 More important than the money, Roche said, has been the involvement of members 
in projects and fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Rotary clubs are planning to sponsor runners in a road race to raise 
money for Meals on Wheels, buying flowers for Valentine's Day to support Rotary 
clubs for college students and planning an auction in March to raise money for 
student scholarships.

STREET SMART: BYPASS FOR FREEWAY BOTTLENECK MAY BE SLOW IN COMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Why is there such a bottleneck on the Ojai Freeway south of Oak View every 
morning and some evenings? 
</P>
<P>
 What is everyone slowing down for? Is everyone making a left turn at Casitas 
Springs? I'm not asking for freeway speeds, but how about a little hustle 
instead of break lights and stop and go? 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done to speed up the traffic flow? 
</P>
<P>
 David Major, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Little can be done to speed traffic on the Ojai Freeway near Casitas Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? For one, it's a two-lane road. Secondly, area residents who have to turn 
from side roads directly onto the freeway want traffic to go slow. 
</P>
<P>
 They worked hard to have 35 m.p.h. signs posted on the roadway, and for the 
most part they stick to it, says Caltrans traffic engineer Bob Houle. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic may have gotten worse in recent weeks as commuters who were thrown off 
their earthquake-damaged freeways seek alternate paths to work. If it's any 
consolation, plans are in the works to build a highway bypass around Casitas 
Springs -- in about 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is putting together some bypass plans for the Board of Supervisors to 
consider this spring, Houle says. But it's a long, tangled road from the 
planning stage to construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I've been concerned for several months about the timing of the lights on New 
Los Angeles Avenue in Moorpark. I thought after the link between the Simi 
Valley and Moorpark freeways opened, they might manage to do a better job 
moving traffic along. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead they put in a new stoplight at the Kmart on Los Angeles Avenue and 
Park Lane. Now, when I try to drive through the city, everything grinds to a 
halt three or four times. To add insult to injury, that new stoplight insists 
on displaying a left turn signal even when no cars are in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
 It often goes red to allow side traffic through, even in the middle of the 
night when there isn't any. This is also a problem at Spring Road, where the 
left turn arrow comes on even when there are no cars turning left. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the city time these lights to better fit the traffic flow? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Zarky, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your traffic woes were caused by a simple case of missing or damaged traffic 
detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Caltrans installed a new signal at Los Angeles Avenue and Park 
Lane in Moorpark. Installing the light was part of a deal made by the new Kmart 
and the city to help keep the throngs of bargain shoppers under control. 
</P>
<P>
 When the light was installed, the Kmart construction wasn't completed. 
</P>
<P>
 So Caltrans decided to delay putting in the copper loops that act as the 
brains of the traffic signal, detecting traffic and controlling the signal 
changes. Regardless of the number of cars at the signal, the timing stayed the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if no cars were in the left turn lane, the light dumbly went through its 
regular cycle, illuminating the left-turn arrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The same problem occurred at Spring Road when a detector loop malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spring Road loop was recently replaced, and about a week ago, traffic 
detector cables were installed at Park Lane, so everything should be 
hunky-dory. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 One of my pet peeves about drivers is that they do not know, or don't care 
about, the rules of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do drivers cross solid double-yellow lines to pass slower traffic, which 
is forbidden by the traffic code, and then these same drivers refuse to cross 
the white line to enter a bike lane when making a right turn? 
</P>
<P>
 It is legal to do so, and also much safer than turning from the middle lane, 
but few drivers do it. The ignorance of this law, or refusal to follow it, is 
especially annoying when right-turning drivers who do not move over end up 
impeding the traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 I have seen many drivers almost rear-end the right-turners because they didn't 
realize the car had slowed for a turn. In most cases the right-turning driver 
does not turn on the turn signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anything be done to make drivers more aware that it is legal to enter bike 
lanes to make right turns? 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Norkin, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks traffic engineer John Helliwell suggests making drivers retake 
their traffic tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously though, Helliwell says little is being done to inform drivers of 
this law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had anybody complain about it," Helliwell says. "It doesn't seem 
to be a top concern for most drivers." 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem may become more pronounced as Thousand Oaks launches plans to 
paint additional bike lanes throughout the city. Over the next several months, 
the city is planning to add three bike loops through town, Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of bike lanes increases, drivers may continue to drive around 
the lanes, or they may become more used to the lanes and learn to merge, 
Helliwell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see what happens and address the problems if any develop," he says.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; STUDENTS TO DEBATE BIRTH-CONTROL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students have organized a debate on a topic that has divided Simi Valley 
parents: whether school officials should add birth-control information to the 
sex-education curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. for Student Empowerment organized the debate between ASE member 
Nitin Nayar, a senior at Royal High School, and Tim Amey, a Simi Valley High 
School senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pushing for an abstinence-based program, one which sets abstinence as 
the standard, because statistics prove that teaching life skills has better 
results than teaching birth control," Tim said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to listen to Wednesday's proceedings, which will include 
opening statements and rebuttals on both sides. Nitin, one of the school 
board's non-voting student members, will argue in favor of discussing birth 
control along with abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 "My position is for a comprehensive sex-education curriculum, one that is 
reality-based and provides sufficient information for teen-agers and treats 
them like mature adults, which is what high school is all about," Nitin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate will be held at 7:30 p.m. at Berylwood Elementary School. BRENDA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER FARMLAND PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long-term plan to develop 737 acres of farmland in northeast Oxnard is 
scheduled to be considered Tuesday evening by the Oxnard City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northeast Community Specific Plan, approved last month by the city's 
Planning Commission, calls for the construction of 3,075 housing units on 496 
acres and commercial, office and research uses on 112 acres.The area is also 
the site of the newly constructed St. John's Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the planning area, owned by 10 individual property owners, is outside 
the Oxnard city limits but would be annexed to the city before development 
could begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was approved after an agreement was reached between three school 
districts and the property owners guaranteeing the districts enough fees to 
build three schools in the plan area. Oxnard also struck an innovative deal 
with the school districts that would provide the the use of the school grounds 
as parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The extensive plan, which has been under study for more than three years, 
regulates building design and specifies how public areas will be landscaped. 
Separate mixed-use "villages" will be developed in the plan area. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also calls for a blend of housing prices, requiring 10% of all 
housing to be affordable for low-income residents and another 10% constructed 
for high-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Most interest in the Northeast Community has come from residential developers, 
according to city Planning Director Matt Winegar, who added that the area 
offers Oxnard its best chance of increasing the stock of affordable housing.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FORUM SCHEDULED ON SCHOOL VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still frightened by last week's shooting of three Westlake High School 
students, Thousand Oaks leaders will hold a public forum at Tuesday's City 
Council meeting to discuss school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Simpson, an assistant superintendent of the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District, will present details of the district's crime-prevention 
efforts and answer questions from the council and the public.The session is 
scheduled for 5 p.m. in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo had proposed the forum even before Thursday's 
incident, in which three students were shot when they gathered to watch a 
prearranged fistfight in North Ranch Park. The violence in Westlake only added 
to his anxiety, Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to know what the schools are doing to prevent this kind of thing," 
Schillo said. Several parents have called him, he added, complaining that they 
fear sending their children to Thousand Oaks classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she welcomed the presentation, Councilwoman Judy Lazar said she did 
not expect to hear answers to the growing problem of teen-age violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal stabbing of a 14-year-old outside a Simi Valley junior high last 
week, coupled with the North Ranch Park incident, demonstrates that teen-age 
rivalries can lead to bloodshed even in the nation's safest cities, she said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; RESTORERS OF ANTIQUES BUSY AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susanne and Gary Gottfried didn't lose anything in the earthquake, but they're 
still cleaning up after its damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura couple, who say they're the only fine art and antiques restorers 
between Hollywood and Santa Barbara, have all the work they can handle since 
the Jan. 17 temblor rocked the county and the rest of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Among their customers is Jeri Morris of Fillmore, whose century-old French 
porcelain vase, passed down from her grandmother, was shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, who was hoping to pass the heirloom on to her daughter, swept up the 
pieces of the vase, put them in a box and took them to the Gottfrieds' Just 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of their work can be high -- the couple charged $2,000 to repair a 
Chinese vase that broke into 60 pieces and took them more than a week to 
reconstruct -- so the Gottfrieds encourage customers to consider whether the 
item is worth the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morris was unfazed. "It's not the monetary value that matters, it's the 
memories," she said. "I'm one of those kind of people who would make a run to 
save the family pictures before I'd go for anything of value." 
</P>
<P>
 In their cluttered studio, a backlog of broken and battered antiques is strewn 
over work tables. 
</P>
<P>
 The objects include shattered ceramics as well as dented and twisted precious 
metals. A pile of 60 pieces of what was once a plate is a puzzle waiting to be 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
 One key to restoring a precious heirloom is finding all the pieces, the 
Gottfrieds said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a huge Chinese vase that we repaired for a woman that was missing a 
piece," said Gary Gottfried. "It turned out that the piece had shot across the 
room more than 30 feet and lodged between some pillows on the couch." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the piece, however, the couple say they could repair the vase by 
matching the size of the missing piece and painting an identical pattern on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to make it look as close to the original as it can be," Gary said. 
"To the customer, the repairs are almost impossible to detect." SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY MULLS MARQUEE FOR CIVIC ARTS 
PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday will consider spending $165,000 on a 
billboard-sized electronic marquee to advertise upcoming events at the Civic 
Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the 240-square-foot marquee would stand on Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard, alerting drivers to theatrical performances or city meetings at the 
Civic Arts Plaza, which is scheduled to open next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Theaters Commission, a council-appointed group responsible for 
policy recommendations, endorsed the large sign on a 6-1 vote -- with the 
provision that the electronic messages remain in place for days at a time and 
not flash every few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But already, several council members have expressed concern that the billboard 
might be too big. Mayor Elois Zeanah, for one, has argued repeatedly that the 
city should not break its own laws by installing oversize signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo said he wonders if such a bulky marquee is necessary, 
especially since motorists on the boulevard usually drive slowly enough to read 
much smaller signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his reservations, however, Schillo said he liked the sign's design and 
approved of the electronic reader board. Opting for a cheaper but more 
old-fashioned marquee with manually changed letters, he said, would "take us 
back to a 1950s football field look." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has scheduled its debate on the marquee after its 7:30 p.m. public 
hearings. STEPHANIE SIMON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BALLOT INITIATIVE DEPOSIT UP FOR VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council is expected Monday to adopt a mandatory $200 deposit 
for ballot initiative petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee will be refunded after city officials verify that the signatures on 
the petitions are valid, City Clerk Barbara Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kam said the rule is being established "to stymie frivolous initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kam acknowledged that few ballot initiatives have been introduced in the 
city's history. In the 32 years she has been a city employee, Kam said she 
recalled only about five initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 For a special election, 15% of registered voters in the city must sign a 
petition initiative, Kam said. During odd-numbered years, when the city holds 
council elections, signatures of 10% of the registered voters would be 
required, Kam said. PEGGY Y. LEE

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER BUS LINK TO TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To encourage commuters to use public transportation, the Thousand Oaks City 
Council on Tuesday will consider chartering a bus to run from The Oaks mall to 
the Metrolink Commuter Rail Station in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus would run Monday through Friday, picking up commuters in the mall's 
park-and-ride lot at 5:25 a.m. and 7 a.m. Evening trips would depart for 
Thousand Oaks about 7 p.m. and 7:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the earthquake and the resulting transportation problem are a great 
impetus in prompting people to change the way they think about getting to 
work," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said.Offering the express bus service -- at $1 
per trip -- might persuade some drivers who have so far stuck with their cars 
to try public transportation, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Running the bus for a five-month trial period will cost about $38,500, 
according to Roy Myers, the city's transportation analyst. But the federal 
government is expected to pick up most of that cost through FEMA loans. The 
remaining expenses would be offset by revenue from the dollar-a-ride fares. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote on the issue during the early part of Tuesday's meeting, 
which begins at 5 p.m. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTY ISSUE / LAWS ON RETROFITTING BUILDINGS; FILLMORE HAS PASSED AN ORDINANCE 
REQUIRING BUSINESSES TO RETROFIT BUILDINGS DAMAGED BY THE JAN. 17 EARTHQUAKE TO 
STRENGTHEN THEM IN CASE OF ANOTHER QUAKE. OTHER CITIES HAVE SIMILAR LAWS BUT 
HAVE BEEN SLOW TO ENFORCE THEM BECAUSE SOME PROPERTY OWNERS SAY THEY CANNOT 
AFFORD THE WORK. ARE SUCH LAWS REASONABLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Crouch, Structural engineer in private practice in Santa Paula  
</P>
<P>
 I am in favor of bringing buildings up to earthquake standards. The state has 
an accepted code book defining what those standards are. It is an issue of 
public safety. But I also have sympathy for property owners and their financial 
difficulty in doing the retrofitting. The two aspects have to be weighed one 
against the other. Santa Paula has a voluntary ordinance. It has worked to a 
certain extent. I think most people are waiting until they are pushed by the 
state or some other authority before they do the work. It is a complex and 
highly emotional problem. But buildings that have been retrofitted have taken a 
big step toward public safety. They will be able to withstand an earthquake 
much better than those that haven't. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Shelley, Ojai city councilwoman  
</P>
<P>
 I am a strong advocate of retrofitting buildings that are used by the public. 
It is the responsible thing to do from a safety standpoint, and business owners 
can incur liability if something serious happens to their customers. We should 
always have the highest regard for human safety. It is a very hard time to ask 
property owners to retrofit their buildings. Fortunately for us in Ojai, we 
were able to retrofit the arcade, our shopping district, where people walk all 
the time. I think even though we are in a recession that everything possible 
should be done to retrofit buildings. That includes covered walkways and 
un-reinforced masonry buildings. Ojai has completed retrofitting the arcade and 
it suffered very little damage from the earthquake. I think other cities that 
are qualified for redevelopment funds might consider using them to shore up old 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Gould, Owner of un - reinforced masonry building on East Main Street 
in Ventura  
</P>
<P>
 There is not enough evidence that retrofitting will do any good. They haven't 
proven in Los Angeles that the buildings that were retrofitted saved lives. The 
buildings that were retrofitted may have stayed up anyway. Most surveys show 
that shoddy workmanship is at fault in most building collapses, whether they 
are built of bricks or not. I own one building in downtown Ventura, and the 
city passed a law to strengthen and attach parapets. I have not done mine yet. 
I am hesitating because I have 44 attachments to make. It's relatively 
expensive, and why spend money on something you don't feel is going to work? 
But I will comply with the law. I just think that the city's priority is wrong. 
I have been begging them to implement an educational program so that people are 
better prepared for earthquakes. But they haven't listened. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Campbell, Mayor pro tem of Fillmore. (His home was destroyed by the 
Northridge quake, but his mechanic business was unharmed.)  
</P>
<P>
 Local government should not only enforce the codes but do everything it can 
through redevelopment agencies to help finance the costs of doing the work. I 
don't think passing a law and then not giving businesses a way to do it 
financially is the right thing to do. In Fillmore, we're lucky because we've 
got the Small Business Assn. They will be able to provide low-interest loans 
for businesses and that will make retrofitting affordable. But I want to take 
that one step further and use our redevelopment agency money to bring the cost 
down even further. I will be pushing for that in the next month or two. I'm not 
saying we have enough to totally finance the rebuilding -- we don't. I'm saying 
we have enough to help write down the cost of the rebuilding loans so that it 
is easier for businesses to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 R.C. Harmonson, Owner of two buildings in downtown Fillmore that were severely 
damaged by the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 I am planning to rebuild, but I don't know how we can rent our buildings and 
pay for retrofitting at the same time. I'm hoping that the city can come up 
with some numbers that will allow us to rebuild the buildings and afford to 
keep operating. I would prefer to retrofit the buildings so that they are 
earthquake-proof in the future. My buildings are made of un-reinforced brick, 
which is the way they built them back in 1906. In the earthquake, we had so 
much damage that my buildings were red-tagged by the inspectors. It's going to 
be awfully hard on us to do to pay for retrofitting. We don't get enough return 
on our property to spend a lot of money on them. It's not a high-rent deal. If 
the city wants to keep us in business, I think we're going to have to have some 
help financially in getting these buildings retrofitted. I'm hoping FEMA or the 
SBA will go along on that.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drug use among teen-agers is rising again after dropping for more than a 
decade, according to a recently released federal study. Although the use of 
hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin has not gone up, the increased use of 
other illicit substances cuts across all socio-economic levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, however, showed that despite public perceptions, the lowest level 
of illicit drug use was reported among African American students. 
</P>
<P>
 Still the question is, what is prompting the increase? In Youth Opinion, a 
sampling of Southern California teens give their views. Some suggest that 
programs such as DARE don't work while others say they should be expanded to 
include high school students. DARE is a federally funded course that sends 
police officers into classrooms to turn kids away from drugs before they get 
started. Still other kids say these programs use scare tactics that just don't 
work anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the national debate over legalization for adults? Could it be 
having an effect on the thinking of younger people? 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and particularly Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders 
have been criticized on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders riled many when she said that the country should study legalization. 
</P>
<P>
 One critic of the Administration's policy, former drug czar William Bennett, 
said the White House has not done enough to discourage the use of illegal 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But some national and local officials side with Elders -- including Orange 
County Superior Court Judge James P. Gray, former Secretary of State George 
Shultz, conservative columnist William F. Buckley and Nobel Prize-winning 
economist Milton Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem may be the continuing use of marijuana by baby boomers. What 
kind of message are they sending to teen-agers? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lloyd Johnston, the University of Michigan research scientist who 
conducted the survey, the use of marijuana increased by three or four 
percentage points during the last two years among eighth-, 10th- and 
12th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the proportion of students reporting marijuana use in the previous 
year was 9% for 8th-graders, 19% for 10th-graders and 26% for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rates of illicit drug use are well below the peak levels reached 
in the late 1970s, "they clearly represent a reversal of the declines we 
recorded for more than a decade," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration now seems prepared to take action. Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala has said that she plans to contact the 
presidents of broadcast networks, film studios, record companies and 
professional sports leagues to urge them "to rededicate themselves to getting 
the message out about prevention." And current drug czar Lee P. Brown said that 
he will convene a national meeting of experts in prevention and drug education 
to confront the problem of drug abuse by young people. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shalala when the study was announced: "These findings are more than a 
warning signal."

IS THE REAL ENEMY IN L.A.

Korean American Christian Education Institute.

<P>
 Last Dec. 17, Jack Sunwoo, 55, became the 22nd Korean American killed by gang 
members in 1993. He owned a small grocery market, Sunmoon, in an area of Los 
Angeles that is overwhelmingly African American and Latino.  
</P>
<P>
 Sunwoo came to the United States with a dream 20 years ago. However, he had a 
hard time getting a professional job because of language and cultural barriers. 
Although he could not get a job, he didn't apply for welfare because of pride. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought a small market and worked with his wife 14 hours a day, without any 
other employees. With the money the couple earned, they raised two sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, he made many friends with African Americans and Latinos in the 
neighborhood. However, he faced many problems like shoplifters and gangbangers 
carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the family's business was burned down while they were asleep at home. 
Through this suffering, his faithfulness to God -- as well as his family's 
unity -- grew tremendously.  
</P>
<P>
 Some suggested that he purchase guns for protection, but he refused. He felt 
that "guns bring guns, and love brings love."  
</P>
<P>
 After rebuilding his market, he shared the love of Christ with his customers. 
He would reward the children with gifts if they memorized verses from the 
Bible. Portions of his income went to help poor neighbors, including paying the 
funeral costs of one. In the 1992 riots, many stores were looted and burned. 
However, Sunwoo's market was saved. When the riot began, his neighborhood 
friends said, "Jack, please close your market and go home; we will keep your 
market safe for you." He and his wife left the store and his dear African 
American friends stationed themselves on the roof, in the back and in the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 His relatives suggested that he should do a safer business. However, he 
refused because he wanted to do God's work in this poor neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 On that December evening, he and his wife were discussing eternal life. Three 
gangbangers came into the store and shot a bullet through the back and into the 
heart of Jack Sunwoo and he died. They asked his wife for money and she gave 
them all that she had. The gun was now aimed at her neck and she questioned 
them with fear, "I gave you all my money, so why do you want to kill me?" The 
gunmen then ran away, sparing her life. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24 bundles of flowers and candles that were left in front of the market by 
neighbors showed their sorrow and grief over this tragic event. Isabel Sanchez, 
26, one of their neighborhood friends, came to his funeral service and said in 
tears, "We lost a great friend. Jack always gave us a hope in Christ. He was a 
missionary rather than a businessman." Why did he have to die? The answer is 
not because of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Korean Americans or other 
ethnic groups. It is because of crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, the market owners' history in South-Central proves that the relationship 
between ethnic and racial groups is not the problem. The first market owners 
were Chinese and Japanese and then Jews. However, the Jews pulled out after the 
1965 Watts riot. Now Korean Americans are the small-business owners who suffer. 
Not because of ethnic problems, but because of crime. Crime is the enemy of the 
whole human race.  
</P>
<P>
 Crime comes from a corrupted mind. A corrupted mind comes from not teaching 
good moral values in homes and in schools. Moral values come from religious 
education, which tells people to discern what is good and what is bad. 
Therefore, without religious education, secular American education will not 
work. Without teaching religious education in homes and in schools, we cannot 
expect to see a successful peace. "Instead of establishing 10 police stations, 
building one church is better for the community," said Korean Christian pioneer 
Koo Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Why has God sent us signs through the riots, economic depression and the 
latest earthquake? It is time to wake up morally and spiritually.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; 
'PERHAPS NONE OF US REALLY WANTS TO SEE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA ORENSTEIN, Rabbi Debra Orenstein is a fellow of the Wilstein Institute 
of Jewish Policy Studies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There has been much talk lately about illegal immigration. Various plans have 
been proposed that would eliminate the incentives for coming to this country 
illegally: discontinue medical care for immigrants without paperwork, amend the 
Constitution so that children born in this country do not automatically become 
citizens. We have also heard, to a lesser extent, proposals that attack the 
problem from other fronts -- by cracking down harder on employers of 
undocumented workers or using the armed forces to enforce our borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the language of these discussions is xenophobic, if not racist. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was not thinking of immigration, xenophobia, or racism when I drove to 
San Diego recently. I was vacationing from the policy questions raised at my 
regular job, the Wilstein Institute for Jewish Policy Studies and thinking of 
my other work. I drove to San Diego from Los Angeles in pursuit of an acting 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 I turned on a talk radio station at one point to pass the time. The subject: 
illegal immigration. So hateful were the messages that I had to change stations 
and settle for sports talk. 
</P>
<P>
 I am relatively new to Southern California. I had never driven to San Diego 
before. It was a shock for me to see signs announcing that pedestrians might be 
crossing the highway. Barely had the words of that sign registered, when I saw 
a pictorial image, communicating the same idea. It was a yellow sign with black 
figures: a mother, leaning forward, pulling a pig-tailed daughter behind her, 
running across the road. Chills went up my spine. I said out loud, alone in the 
car, rather stupidly: "Do people know about this?" I looked at the passengers 
in the other cars, to see if I could detect their surprise. But, as far as I 
could tell, their world had not slowed to a strange, molasses pace, as mine 
had. 
</P>
<P>
 I recalled a news story about a man who was killed trying to cross the 
highway, so that he could enter the United States unimpeded. Seeing these road 
signs, I realized that his case could not be unique. 
</P>
<P>
 The pictorial image of mother and daughter would not leave me. I thought of 
the first adult novel I ever read, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and the slave Eliza 
running across the ice to freedom.  
</P>
<P>
 I was called back to San Diego for another audition. This time, I anticipated 
the sign. It turns out, my vision had been quite selective. The sign was of two 
adults and a child. Leading the mother and daughter that I remembered, was a 
father, his head down in concentration, rather than looking out in the 
direction he was running. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Jew whose family survived the Holocaust by immigrating to various 
countries, legally and illegally, I felt complete empathy for the human picture 
before me. In fact, I read myself -- a single woman -- so completely into the 
picture that I erased the male figure entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 I was astounded at so gross an error. Perhaps my mistake helps to explain how 
some miss these signs altogether and how we all miss things all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the place where the signs are posted, a government official of 
some kind stopped traffic at the "weighing station." He waved most cars on, 
checking a few that held Latino passengers. No one slowed down to look as those 
cars were checked. Perhaps this is because routine checks according to one's 
race are no longer unexpected, perhaps it is because none of us really wants to 
see.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
DOWNTOWN: BRINGING OUT THE ARTIST IN INNER-CITY YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Times researcher PATRICIA A. KONLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downtown is home to some of Los Angeles' premiere arts venues, including the 
Museum of Contemporary Art and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. It is also home 
to thousands of the city's poorest students, many of whom are newly arrived 
Latino immigrants. Helping link the worlds is Inner-City Arts, a nonprofit art 
center. Founded in 1989 with funds from grants, foundations and businesses, ICA 
provides bilingual arts education for about 2,000 elementary school pupils who 
live in the gritty industrial area that stretches roughly from Macy to Hope 
streets to Jefferson Boulevard to the San Ana Freeway. ICA uses the arts to 
bridge cultural and language gaps for children from four schools. It is the 
only full-fledged privately funded arts curriculum to operate within the Los 
Angeles Unified School District during the school day. A small after-school 
program is also offered at no charge. HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS 
</P>
<P>
 Third- through sixth-graders meet at ICA studios twice a week for six weeks 
for their only art instruction of the year outside their classroom. They are 
bused by LAUSD to the center's temporary Towne Avenue site, where they study 
painting and ceramics. Music and performing arts will be added in late spring 
when ICA opens its new 16,000-square-foot building on nearby Kohler Street, 
purchased with a $600,000 grant from the Mark Taper Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first part of each session, artists introduce basic concepts such as 
foreground and background and explain the difference between mediums such as 
oil versus watercolor. A language teacher helps students to explain their work. 
The goal is to build vocabulary, leading to sentence development and increased 
oral and writing skills. SUCCESSES 
</P>
<P>
 The Business Committee in the Arts a New York-based corporate arts group, and 
Forbes magazine honored ICA in 1992 and 1993 for innovation in developing small 
business/arts partnerships. Among them was a novel plan that let 10 small 
companies guarantee $50,000 of a $500,000 bank loan to allow renovation to 
begin on the Mark Taper Center/Inner-City Arts building at 720 Kohler St. while 
fund raising continues. A TEACHER'S VIEW

 This is no hokey art project. Some of these students have severe emotional 
problems. This program gives them a positive experience and shows how they can 
work with one another.  
</P>
<P>
 A child learns his creation is unique, which bolsters self-esteem. The child 
learns how to express his inner feelings when explaining what he did. The child 
also speaks in front of his peers and learns to accept criticism. I then let 
the student go to the computer and write about his creative venture. I am able 
to take the child from the abstract into the academic field. For English as a 
Second Language students, the process of the bilingual ICA program is 
especially important. 
</P>
<P>
 I also take part and draw. It gives me a new perspective. I tie in math by 
asking students to think how far away an object in the background of their 
picture may be. It can also help with science. A student draws a leaf and you 
can introduce other leaves and the differences between them. A BACKER'S

<P>
 I watched a group of 9- and 10-year-old boys. They were so excited, so proud 
of their sculptures and what they accomplished. You could see them make a 
connection between soul, brain and hands. It was such a constructive way of 
expression. I thought, "That's the key to getting them not to do graffiti or 
beat each other up." Teachers also tell us that it gives them a better 
attention span.  
</P>
<P>
 In business, when you have problems with a product, you go back to the 
inception to see what went wrong. To deal with the problems around us, we have 
to focus on children. We have this wonderful raw material -- there's not a lot 
of evil 5 year olds. Yet something happens in the process that we end up with a 
product that we often have to warehouse in jail or some welfare program. ICA is 
an innovative attempt to give these little kids the tools to deal creatively 
with the world around them.

measured by their artists. There's a reason for that: The highest and best self 
comes out there. DEMOGRAPHICS

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
RICHARD MOORE AND BLENDA J. WILSON; 2 SCHOOLS HIT BY QUAKE TRY TO GET IT 
TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S.J. Diamond, Cal State Northridge and Santa Monica College suffered some of 
the severest damage of the Jan. 17 Northridge quake, although no one was hurt. 
With funding for restorations unpredictable and the spring semester about to 
start, both are making quick and imaginative adjustments in the midst of 
disarray. S.J. Diamond spoke with Santa Monica's president, Richard Moore, and 
Blenda J. Wilson, president of Northridge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: What was the effect of the Northridge earthquake on your campus? 
</P>
<P>
 Moore: The three-floor science building, which also housed our central 
computer and telephone system, was lifted at its north end and thrown south. It 
had 350 broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door, 200 windows were blown out in the liberal arts building; in the 
next week, the building was banged apart. We lost 40 classrooms and labs and 
one parking structure. In our business building, water heaters on the roof 
broke and flooded, bringing the ceilings down two floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: All 53 buildings (at Northridge) were affected to some degree. A dozen 
major buildings -- generally the tallest ones -- had significant damage. A 
parking structure collapsed. A chemical fire burned out two floors of a science 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact on operations was extreme. In those buildings were computers, 
faxes, copy machines. Since none of our buildings can be occupied yet, we're 
operating from tents and trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much rebuilding is needed? 
</P>
<P>
 Moore: Santa Monica probably has $26 million in damage -- $15 million to 
rebuild the science building, which everybody agrees is a goner. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: We'll need to rebuild a lot, but no entire buildings, with the 
possible exception of the south library, which is unsound. That parking 
structure will need to be picked up and taken away. We've already taken down 
the 42-ton pedestrian bridges between science buildings because they've become 
unstable; removed the tower section of Sierra Hall, an eight-story building, 
and pulled most of the debris off Oviatt library, which looks bad cosmetically, 
but is structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost? We don't know. In addition to restoration, the 300 trailers we 
brought on campus for classrooms and offices cost something like $1 million a 
month; the hazardous materials people cost $15,000 a day; the asbestos removal 
costs $25,000 a day. It easily puts us in the $250-$300 million range. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can the schools function? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: Spring term will be starting Feb. 14, two weeks later than scheduled; 
we expect 22,000 students -- 17,000 of them registered before the earthquake. 
W've made arrangements for students who lost their off-campus housing to attend 
CSU campuses near their families' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll have trailers all around campus and eight or nine buildings fixed up for 
offices and programs like student union, student health, athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, we always made backup tapes of computer records and stored them 
in the old south library. All our student records are now on the computers at 
Cal State Fresno, which is running our registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore: We expect 24,000 students in mid-February for the 16-week spring 
semester. We pushed that opening up a week to Feb. 22. The college is running. 
Our central computer fell over, but we just stood it up and it went on working. 
We've organized a mobile classroom village, including chemistry and biology 
labs, on the tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you any other alternatives? 
</P>
<P>
 Moore: We have a rented building at the Santa Monica Airport and half of an 
unused elementary school. People can also park at the airport and be shuttled 
to the campus. The city owns a light-rail junction point on Olympic that it 
would rent us for an educational village. Various schools -- St. Monica High, 
Santa Monica Unified, Crossroads -- have offered the use of rooms at night. 
This is a very cooperative town. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: The response has been very generous. We have offers of space at Valley 
College, Pierce, Mission and Pepperdine's continuing-education center in 
Northridge. Commercial enterprises have offered mostly skills or supplies. 
Hughes, for example, gave us several hundred desks and chairs, and Pacific Bell 
gave us free cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Might the earthquake even lead to good arrangements? 
</P>
<P>
 Moore: Yes. There needs to be new partnerships in higher education, 
particularly among tax-supported institutions. Maybe we should try to get state 
and private monies to build "educational villages" which provide everything 
from job training to master's degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: We are beginning to talk about potential for long-range collaboration 
with Santa Monica. The intellectual excitement beyond the drudgery is to figure 
out how to do some things better than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are you holding up personally? 
</P>
<P>
 Moore: I live in Santa Monica Canyon. We lost the fireplace, chimney and 
dishes, but our three children are OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: I live a mile and a half from campus in a university-owned home. Every 
glass and cabinet that could break did -- including two toilets and the solar 
panels, but my husband and I were not hurt and the house is OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why not just close while you rebuild? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: This university, unlike a full-time residence college, is central to 
the Tri-Valley region: our students are citizens and employees, and the 
recovery of the community and the recovery of the university are 
interdependent. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore: In community colleges, we put together dreams and hopes that people 
haven't had in years; we're not going to shelve them because of fire or flood. 
Success doesn't require genius, but passion, endurance, dreams and hard work. 
There are fewer and fewer school opportunities; we're committed to not slowing 
down anyone's education.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; WAS THE 
TEMBLOR GOD'S 'JUDGMENT'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Compiled for the Times by James Blair and Robin Greene 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. R. L. HYMERS 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor, Fundamentalist Baptist Tabernacle, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 God's judgment has fallen on Los Angeles much in the same way it did on the 
Egyptian people in the Book of Exodus. Ten judgments fell on the Egyptians for 
their persecution of the Hebrews and their rejection of God. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel we've had five similar judgments on Southern California in the last 
several years for sin. We are in the seventh -- though not consecutive -- year 
of drought. In the Bible, that is associated with judgment. We've had a riot. 
We've had a fire in Malibu among the elite who escaped the riot. We have an 
AIDS epidemic which in my judgment is sent from God. And we've had an 
earthquake. The Rev. DARREL ROMMEL 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor, Joy Christian Fellowship, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 It's kind of a sad message that anyone would lay the blame for an earthquake 
or happening such as that on God. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem He would be very contradictory if He sent His son to save the 
world and the people of the world -- to pay the price for our sin -- if we then 
turned around and said He came because of sin and brought destruction and 
earthquake or AIDS or whatever. The word of God clearly says in the Book of 
John that Jesus came to bring life abundantly to the people, but the thief -- 
meaning Satan -- has come to kill, steal and destroy. God would be undoing the 
thing He said very clearly in His word. 
</P>
<P>
 Our standpoint and, I believe, the evangelical Christian Church standpoint 
would be that the earthquake would not be the work of the God who created the 
world. It would be the work of the god of this world which, the New Testament 
clearly says, is Satan. The Rev. MARJ BRITT 
</P>
<P>
 Minister, Unity Church of Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 I don't believe God is a wrathful God. I believe God is a loving God who moves 
in and through our lives as love, ever pulling us forward into all that we are. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes sense to me is that there are cycles in our experience of life 
going over many centuries and generations. God moves through our lives in ways 
that an experience we perceive in one moment of catastrophe can open to us 
realms of potential that we perhaps have not even dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the most difficult experiences, there are opportunities if we are 
willing to see with "new eyes." Life on this planet is about learning, 
forgiving and becoming. The Rev. PATRICIA GREIG BENNETT 
</P>
<P>
 Rector, St. Barnabas Episcopal Church, Pasadena 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the wrath of God? That's not what I got out of my congregation. The 
question was, "Is God trying to tell us who's in charge?" 
</P>
<P>
 We're not promised a Garden of Eden. The planet we live on is live, not dead. 
Earthquakes happen. The East is suffering severe cold. The Midwest is being 
ravaged by floods. I grew up in the Northeast; we had hurricanes. I lived in 
Atlanta and there were tornadoes. No matter where you are there is some kind of 
phenomenon, part of living on this Earth. Imam JAN M. DIWAN 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic Center, Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 It's a test and a trial. I don't call it punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that God says, "All you who believe, ask my help with prayer and 
patience." He may try you with the loss of your dear ones, hunger or economic 
loss. I advise those who are afflicted to say, "To God we belong and to God is 
our return." Give glad tidings for the mercy and guidance of God and that they 
are righteous people.  
</P>
<P>
 At the center, they have been helping each other and they have forgotten all 
differences. If you come, they don't ask if you're a Christian or a Jew or a 
Muslim. Even if somebody says he is an atheist we must help him. If he is an 
atheist, that's his business not our business. TAD CALLISTER

 We do not doubt that God has the power to cause natural disasters in response 
to the wickedness of man. Certainly, He caused the flood at Noah's time and the 
drought at Elijah's time because of the wickedness of the people. He has also 
told us, however, that the rain falls upon the just and the unjust, meaning 
that the elements may cause damage in the natural course of events without 
divine intervention. SARIKA DHARMA

 Buddhism is a nontheistic religion, which means we do not have a 
God-the-creator involved in our view of the world. We don't say there is no 
God; but we don't say there is. Our view would certainly not be that this 
earthquake is a voice from above saying you've done something wrong.

FOOD AID TO BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' Jan. 28 editorial, "The Atrocity of the Food Weapon," by quoting 
only December deliveries to Bosnia, is a distortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint commission for delivery of humanitarian aid has stated that aid 
convoys passed unhindered through the Croatian Defense Council-controlled 
territory for the period Oct. 17-Dec. 13, as follows: 244 aid convoys with 14 
tons total; 134 convoys, 8.5 tons, Muslims; 98 convoys, 4 tons, Croat; 12 
convoys, 1.5 tons, Serb. 
</P>
<P>
 How can you call Croats "genocidal" when they have fed and sheltered nearly 
300,000 Bosnian Muslims in Croatia for nearly two years? the U.S. Bosnian aid 
effort pales in equivalency.

M. GIMBUTAS; ARCHEOLOGIST OF EARLY EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marija Gimbutas, an internationally recognized archeologist whose research 
into early European cultures convinced her and other experts that women were 
revered as goddesses 6,000 to 8,000 years ago and that they presided over 
cities free of war, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Marler, her friend and editor, said she was 73 when she died of cancer 
Wednesday at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Author of 20 books and more than 200 articles on European prehistory, the 
Lithuanian-born Gimbutas was professor emeritus of European archeology at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of her most recent books -- "Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe," "The 
Language of the Goddess" and "The Civilization of the Goddess" -- challenged 
established views of neolithic Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 She referred to those cultures as "true civilizations," undisturbed by war and 
containing organized cities adorned with sophisticated art. The existence of 
thousands of female images led her to conclude that women were worshiped and 
the primary deity was a goddess. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her most controversial theses was that the world was at peace 
throughout the Stone Age, with the two sexes living in peaceful coexistence -- 
women running the temples and men performing physical chores -- but that this 
all was eventually replaced by the worship of warlike gods imported by 
marauding Indo-Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of her colleagues challenged her conclusions, her work was 
praised by feminists throughout the world and by such noted figures as 
mythologist Joseph Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerda Lerner, a University of Wisconsin historian, said that although 
Gimbutas' theories might never be proved, they served to "challenge, inspire 
and fascinate" by providing alternatives to male-dominated cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Vilnius, Lithuania, Gimbutas received a doctorate in archeology in 
1946 from Tubingen University in Germany. She immigrated to the United States 
in 1949, did research at Harvard University and joined the UCLA faculty in 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
 She retired four years ago after leading five archeological excavations in 
southeastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 She won the Outstanding New American award in 1960 and was named a Los Angeles 
Times Woman of the Year in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include three daughters, who ask that contributions be sent to the 
Marija Gimbutas Annual Lecture Fund, in care of the Institute of Archeology at 
UCLA.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A GREAT REASON TO HANG OUT AT THE MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Californians may not be packed in like sardines yet, despite the 
region's increasing urbanization, but schools definitely are feeling a squeeze. 
Many cities are experiencing substantial increases among their populations of 
young adults, and that means ever-growing numbers of children who need seats in 
schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Typically, children are crowded into existing buildings and portable buildings 
start popping up on campuses when money for new facilities is tight. Now, with 
a plan for a first-ever "space-saver" school in Santa Ana, the state is seeking 
to take an innovative approach to urban public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than sprawling for a block or more in a residential neighborhood, the 
school would occupy a yet-to-be-built three-story structure that would house a 
parking garage on the ground floor and classrooms for 1,300 intermediate-grade 
students on the two floors above. 
</P>
<P>
 The location, too, is unusual: a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature, which promised to fund the program from bond measures, 
recommended that urban school districts build new facilities next to or atop 
underutilized commercial or industrial buildings to avoid condemning property 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Urbanized Santa Ana is an ideal place to launch the project. School board 
members say they could use 10 new schools right now, and they expect enrollment 
to rise even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Such imaginative approaches to neighborhood schools are needed throughout the 
region. For example, when damage from the Northridge earthquake forced Los 
Angeles campuses to close, LEARN (the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for 
Restructuring Now) wisely began an effort to take advantage of vacant 
commercial spaces nearby and convert empty offices into classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the Santa Ana effort are questions from some neighbors of the Bristol 
Market Place mall, where the 98,000-square-foot campus would be built. They 
worry about traffic, parking and crime problems that might arise from a new 
school. We hope that the proposal will not be done in by nothing more than 
"not-in-my-back-yard" resistance. Santa Ana ought to have an opportunity to try 
this promising approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has earmarked $23 million to buy the Santa Ana property and has 
promised $20 million more to build the school and recreational facilities. At a 
time when funds are scarce in Sacramento, Santa Ana is in line for a windfall 
that promises to be a useful model for other districts.

FREEWAYS, TRAINS AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dissertation by Prof. James E. Moore II, "Fix the Freeways Before Funding 
Trains" (Jan. 25), proves that one can be a college professor and still be 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Did not the good professor notice that, after cleaning up one derailment 
caused by our recent earthquake, rail service was restored and expanded (within 
days) to the gratitude of thousands of commuters while their automobile-bound 
brethren will be discombobulated for months to come? 
</P>
<P>
 The professor also admits that occasional freeway failures are a statistical 
certainty, since no structure is earthquake-proof. This means that it is also a 
statistical certainty that auto commuters will suffer in the future because of 
said failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink's flexibility and durability should be a wake-up call for Mr. Moore. 
Instead, he calls for more of the same decisions that have proven to be 
detrimental to commuters. I note that his expertise is in the fields of urban 
and regional planning and civil engineering, both of which were major 
contributors to the costs of the latest earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 I would be elated if I had the opportunity to ride a train to and from work, 
and don't understand why anyone would rather drive a car on a dangerous, 
crowded, stinking freeway unless forced to. Hopefully, businesses will see the 
advantages of switching employees to mass transit before gridlock and 
government do it for them.

CARING ABOUT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) -- You just don't get it, do you! You criticize 
Janet Reno for caring "more about day care than about violent crime." How do 
you think criminals are made? And what do you think the answer to the crime 
problem is? Locking everyone up? Ms. Reno understands that we need to invest in 
the "people infrastructure" of our nation -- our children -- to reduce crime. 
Bravo to her!

FALLOUT FROM RISING RATES; ASIAN STOCKS RESPOND IN KIND TO DOW'S SLIDE; 
SECURITIES: ANALYSTS CALL IT A KNEE-JERK REACTION TO THE 96-POINT PLUNGE. SOME 
FEAR A GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Asian stock markets fell in early trading today, the first day of activity 
after Friday's 96.24-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the selloff was mostly a knee-jerk reaction to the American 
market's slide, but that investors were also worried that the U.S. Federal 
Reserve's shift to tighter credit could slow global economic growth -- which 
would affect booming Asian export economies. 
</P>
<P>
 New Zealand's key stock index fell 47.74 points to 2,365.50, a 2% loss, though 
brokers said there was no panic selling. 
</P>
<P>
 In midday trading today, however, many Southeast Asian markets were faring 
much worse: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was off 728.24 points, or 6%, to 11,429.33. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the KLSE composite index was down 4.5%, off 51.69 
points to 1,095.63. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Bangkok market was hit by a selling mania, as the SET index fell 103.48 
points, or 7.2%, to 1,340.33. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Seoul, South Korea, the main index was off 22.20 points, or 2.4%, to 
920.40 at midday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, meanwhile, the Nikkei index was off 227.02 points, or 1.1%, to 
20,074.41 at midday, a relatively muted response to the American market's 
Friday turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 However, experts noted that the Tokyo market is already the world's most 
depressed major market, and thus may not be at as much risk of loss as many 
smaller, high-flying Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, while market declines of 2% or more are significant by U.S. standards, 
many smaller Asian markets are by nature volatile and often rise or fall by 2% 
or more on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders in Europe were also expecting large declines today. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, meanwhile, was trading at 108.90 yen in Tokyo early today, down 
slightly from Friday's 109.25 close in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's 2.4% tumble Friday came after the Federal Reserve, acting to head 
off inflation as the economy expands, bumped short-term interest rates by 
raising the federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for 
overnight loans -- to 3.25% from 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the increase was tiny, the move was important because it is the first 
such action in five years by the Fed. Some analysts are seeing it as a possible 
precursor to further tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" 
Sunday, said it is possible the Fed may raise rates again, and the Clinton 
Administration won't try to dissuade it from doing so. "That's always a 
possibility," Bentsen said of another Fed hike. Bentsen declared that inflation 
is under control, predicting that consumer prices will rise about 3% this year, 
up a shade from last year's increase.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: FALLOUT FROM RISING RATES; THE FED AND THE MARKETS: 
WHAT INVESTORS NEED TO KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday's 96.24-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials -- a reaction to the 
Federal Reserve's first official interest rate hike since 1989 -- raised 
concerns about the bull market's future. The Dow's plunge was its largest 
one-day drop in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 What should you make of this move? And should it change your investment plans? 
Here are answers to questions stock and bond investors may have in the wake of 
the Fed's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why did the stock market react so badly, when the Fed's move had 
been widely expected? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: That question dogged many pros, who admit that this was perhaps the 
most anticipated Fed credit-tightening in history. Just last Monday, Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that the strengthening economy would inevitably 
produce somewhat higher short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, the Fed's move to raise a key short-term interest rate, the federal 
funds rate, from 3.0% to 3.25% should have been built into stock prices; the 
actual announcement on Friday should have prompted investor yawns. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem may have been one of simple complacency: Whenever too many 
investors assume the market will act a certain way, it often does the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, because stocks had surged to record highs earlier last week -- pulling 
in many short-term speculators -- those traders were poised to exit at the 
first hint of bad news.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But historically, haven't stocks dropped whenever interest rates have 
risen? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That is one of the market's biggest myths. The truth is, rising rates 
generally don't end bull markets -- not in the initial stages of the rate rise, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, as the economy begins to gain steam after a recession, short-term 
rates rise as consumers and businesses borrow more. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of focusing on the turn in interest rates, stock investors usually 
focus more on the surge in corporate earnings that is a byproduct of a stronger 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that stock prices and short-term rates often advance together as 
the economy revs up. That occurred in 1983, for example: Three-month Treasury 
bill yields rose from 8% to 9% with the burgeoning economy, yet the Standard & 
Poor's 500-stock index jumped 17% that year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much of a rate rise will it take to kill the bull market? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is no set increase that anyone can point to in advance and say, "This 
is it." It's unclear how high short-term rates would have to rise, for example, 
before individual investors would decide that they're better off in a money 
market fund than in stocks, thus reducing the crucial flow of fresh cash into 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many experts believe that short rates will have to rise significantly 
more than the quarter-point increase the Fed has dictated before money funds 
provide competition for stocks. Money funds' average yield, now 2.72%, could 
rise to 3% with the Fed move. But that would still be rather paltry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Street analysts, in forecasting bear markets, look to the frequency 
of Fed rate hikes as a guide rather than how much rates rise. One classic rule 
is "three jumps and a stumble": Historically, the stock market often has peaked 
only after the Fed raises rates three successive times.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If the economy is OK, shouldn't stock prices quickly recover? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In theory, yes. Many investors feel that little has changed, despite the 
Fed move. "The economic recovery is real, and corporate profits should show a 
very nice increase this year," says Larry Auriana, co-manager of the Kaufmann 
stock fund in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, investors large and small have been conditioned since the 1987 
market crash to buy on any dramatic declines -- because prices have rebounded 
every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, stock mutual funds have large cash hoards waiting to be invested; 
the funds' cash holdings equaled nearly $60 billion, or 8.5% of total assets, 
as 1994 began. What's more, stock funds now have a tremendous regular source of 
incoming cash that many didn't have in the '80s: money from 401(k) retirement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But again, the problem here may be too much complacency: Investors expect the 
market to resurge. If it doesn't come back immediately this morning, potential 
buyers could continue to wait on the sidelines -- allowing prices to fall 
further, which in turn could increase investors' cautiousness, setting off an 
even deeper slide. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, small investors' complacency was evident in a report from Fidelity 
Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company: Despite Friday's market 
plunge, Fidelity said it got relatively few weekend calls to its toll-free 
information numbers, from buyers or sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very light weekend," said spokeswoman Tracey Gordon. Of course, 
it's heartening that investors weren't calling to sell -- but neither were they 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the worst-case scenar io for stocks? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Fed's rate boost could be enough to trigger the first meaningful 
"correction" in this 39-month-old bull market. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically as bull markets advance, stocks experience periodic selloffs that 
clip 5% to 10% from the Dow index, the S&P 500 and other indexes as investors 
take profits. In this bull run, however, the market as a whole has yet to give 
up more than 5% of its advance (though many individual stocks certainly have 
done so). 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely because this bull market has held up for so long, the Fed's move 
makes it vulnerable to a true correction, many experts say. "When the market 
gets to be like a coiled spring, something like this can trigger its release," 
says Ralph Wanger, who heads the $4-billion Acorn Funds in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Dow were to drop 10% from its all-time high of 3,978.36 last Monday, it 
would fall another 300 points after Friday's 96.24-point, 2.4% decline. That 
would put the index at about 3,580, back to where it was last September. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Wouldn't that kind of slide be a definite buying opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Assuming the economy's expansion remains on track, the answer is yes, most 
analysts say. Though stock prices are historically high now, relative to 
earnings and dividends, a growing economy will boost earnings and thus 
dividends -- which will make stocks appear much cheaper over time. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk is that the economy proves much more vulnerable than expected to the 
relatively small rate increase engineered by the Fed last week. If business 
activity were to slump again by spring, the stock market could be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which stocks or stock groups could fare best when the market rebounds? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you believe that the economy will continue to grow, many analysts say 
the stocks to own are the same market stars of 1993 and the first month of this 
year: industrial issues such as autos, steel, machinery and other groups that 
should see greater demand for their products as consumers and businesses spend 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts note that big-name industrial issues in particular could benefit if 
foreign investors increase their purchases of U.S. stocks. And foreigners may 
soon have a very good reason to boost their buying here: Higher interest rates 
in America have a side effect of bolstering the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the dollar zoomed to a 2 1/2-year high against the German mark on 
Friday after the Fed rate hike. When the dollar rises in value, it 
automatically boosts the value of U.S. stocks owned by foreigners -- giving 
them more incentive to own U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What if I own bonds? Is it time to sell, if rates are going up? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Generally speaking, it becomes much more difficult to make money in bonds 
as rates rise, because higher market rates erode the value of existing bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the investors hurt worst in bonds in recent weeks have been owners 
of supposedly safer shorter-term issues. Anticipating the Fed's rate hike, the 
market has pushed up short rates by more than a quarter point, slicing into 
shorter bonds' values. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term yields, in contrast, haven't risen nearly as much. And some experts 
say long-term yields could even drop this spring, despite higher short rates, 
if investors believe that the Fed's efforts to slow the economy will ultimately 
keep inflation in check. Long-term yields respond more to inflation concerns 
than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 For bond investors who need interest income, the best strategy remains the 
simplest: Split your investment among short-term, intermediate-term and 
long-term bonds or bond funds. That will give you maximum flexibility, however 
interest rates move from here. How Rates Have Surged 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve officially raised short-term interest rates on Friday, but 
the market has been pushing Treasury security yields up for weeks in 
anticipation. 04,16,09,08,12 Jan. 21 Friday Treasury issue yield yield Change

 A new lickless postage stamp from the makers of Post-it notes and Scotch tape

 The new 29-cent, self-adhesive Eagle stamp issued Friday at a public ceremony

MERGER MANIA; PROFITS, EFFICIENCY FUEL FRENZY OF BANK CONSOLIDATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is likely to be another wild year for the nation's banking industry, with 
the drive to consolidate so powerful that few financial institutions, no matter 
how large, are safe from merger or takeover, industry experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions asked among industry leaders now: Who is on the prowl for 
what,and how fast is the current merger pace going to accelerate? There were 
380 banking industry mergers in 1992 and the same number in 1993, and some 
industry analysts believe that as many as half of the existing 11,000 
commercial banks may not be around in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, BankAmerica Corp.'s recent proposal to buy Continental Bank Corp. 
in Chicago for $1.9 billion is the latest example of a newer trend that goes 
beyond mergers involving financial institutions in the same city or state. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest deals increasingly involve forays into different regions and the 
acquisition of new financial service products, as illustrated by the desire of 
California-based, consumer-driven BankAmerica to buy a Midwestern bank that 
caters largely to blue-chip corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mergers are really taking a different turn," said Victor J. Riley, chairman 
of KeyCorp. in Albany, N.Y., whose proposed $4-billion purchase of Society 
Corp. of Cleveland would wed the nation's 25th- and 30th-largest banks. "Banks 
are now going to try to merge with different organizations and different 
product mixes. Before, they looked at the synergies." 
</P>
<P>
 One financial institution hot on the acquisition trail is Los Angeles-based 
First Interstate Bancorp, which bought five financial institutions in 
California and Texas in 1993. And there is no shortage of acquisition 
candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 400 or so banks in California, half of them are for sale," said one 
major California bank's chief executive, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders increasingly see virtue in size. The bigger the financial institution 
and its cushion of capital, the bigger the loans they can make -- a key issue 
for U.S. lenders playing catch-up with large Japanese and European banks that 
have captured a major chunk of the U.S. corporate lending market. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bigger the financial institution, the more acquisitive it can 
be. It's known as the "springboard effect."  
</P>
<P>
 "The bigger you are, the more acquisitions you can make," said attorney H. 
Rodgin Cohen of Sullivan & Cromwell in New York, a bank merger expert who 
thinks 1994 merger activity will equal or surpass last year's rapid pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Who loses? "Redundant" employees who face layoff are obvious victims. So are 
retail branch customers who complain that service inevitably declines after a 
merger. Former Security Pacific customers still complain of account snafus 
nearly two years after their bank was swallowed up by Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 That dissatisfaction reflects how big banks increasingly rely on technology to 
cut costs and justify the mergers financially. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, San Diego Trust & Savings Bank, a service-oriented bank being 
acquired by First Interstate, was one of the last big banks in California to 
employ mainly full-time tellers. Those jobs are now being phased out in favor 
of part-time employees to keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 One graphic case of how customers suffer from consolidation exists in Julian, 
a picturesque former mining town turned tourist destination in the mountains 60 
miles east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian's only bank branch, an office of HomeFed Bank, was closed in December 
after Great Western Bank acquired HomeFed's branches. Great Western thought the 
deposits in the branch were not large enough to justify a branch there. As a 
result, Julian's 5,000 residents must now travel 30 miles to the nearest bank 
branch and automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
 While advocates of consolidation concede that "dislocation" is inevitable 
after a merger, they insist that consumers benefit from lower-cost loans and 
higher-paying deposits. And regardless of the complaints of small customers, 
the merger pace is unlikely to slow. 
</P>
<P>
 While no national banks exist today, the regulatory barriers to interstate 
banking are falling fast. As a result, between 10 and 20 national banks, as 
well 50 to 100 large regional banks, could be created by 2000, said Joel P. 
Friedman, a bank specialist with Andersen Consulting in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is the industry contracting so rapidly? 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, mergers are profitable. As one banker put it in industry 
argot, mergers are "an efficiency play," providing financial institutions with 
a way to boost profit in today's highly competitive market. By combining two 
large banking concerns, the acquiring bank can cut as much as 40% from the 
overhead costs of the bank being taken over. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition strategies -- and profits -- of First Interstate, Wells Fargo 
and other so-called super-regional banks such as NationsBank, Banc One and 
KeyCorp, have caught the attention of banks nationwide, said Paine Webber 
banking analyst Lawrence W. Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance to cut costs and boost earnings was the driving force behind 
Comerica's purchase in recent years of two large independent banks in San Jose: 
Plaza Bank of Commerce and Pacific Western Bank.  
</P>
<P>
 It's easier to boost earnings after a merger than it is to simply compete 
"with 11,000 other banks in a very mature industry," says J. Michael Fulton, 
who heads Comerica's operations in California. (Detroit-based Comerica is the 
nation's 27th-largest bank, with nearly $30 billion in assets.) 
</P>
<P>
 The banks have little choice. Competition from mortgage bankers and mutual 
funds has forced them to be more efficient. And investing in the computer 
equipment to remain competitive is so expensive that it makes sense only for 
banks that can spread the cost over a larger base of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Having expanded its retail base on the West Coast and in Texas with 23 
acquisitions since 1989, BankAmerica is now focusing on leaping across state 
boundaries into commercial loan markets. 
</P>
<P>
 A losing bidder for Bank of New England commercial bank in 1991, BankAmerica 
could follow the Continental deal with similar moves in eastern and other 
Midwestern cities, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 However, BankAmerica's chief financial officer, Lewis W. Coleman, said in an 
interview that the company is more interested "in running what we've got" than 
jumping into another major merger deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state rules prohibiting encroachment by out-of-state banks are 
gradually disappearing, and several bills in Congress would eliminate them 
altogether. However, regulators are likely to raise yellow flags when a 
proposed merger gives a financial institution at least 50% of the deposits in a 
major market. 
</P>
<P>
 As Thomas D. Thomson, executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
San Francisco, put it: "We will have to make sure we don't get a degree of 
market concentration that leads to market power in which the consumer might be 
ill-served." Biggest Banking Mergers 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by big profits and disappearing barriers to interstate mergers, 
financial institutions are stepping up the pace of acquisitions. Most of the 
mergers--18 of the 25 largest deals since 1990--involved banks and thrifts 
based in different states, a trend exemplified by Bank of America's proposed 
merger with Continental Bank of Chicago announced Jan. 28.

 Revlon Chairman Ronald O. Perelman was supposed to get a crack at fulfilling 
his fantasy of playing the drums in a Las Vegas hotel show, but the gig fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as in most of his deals, Perelman still ended up getting richer -- this 
time by $290. 
</P>
<P>
 Perelman was scheduled to play the drums at singer Paul Anka's show at Bally's 
the weekend before last but was called out of town unexpectedly on business. 
</P>
<P>
 Anka spokesman Lee Solters says the singer had already paid Perelman the $290 
scale wages for the job "to avoid any union problems." Anka also gave Perelman 
a band jacket, Solters says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Perelman needs the $290. According to Forbes magazine, he's worth 
about $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Solters: "He can buy a new pair of drum sticks with it." Giving Them a

<P>
 The aftershocks from the Northridge earthquake haven't even stopped, and rival 
business recruiters from other states are already bringing up the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Mexico Economic Development Department sent out an announcement saying 
officials from the state will be working a booth this week at a Southern 
California Business Expansion/Relocation Expo in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will the quake shake away many businesses from California?" the announcement 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes on to cite information from an Albuquerque Journal article reporting 
that the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce in the two weeks after the quake 
received twice as many inquiries from Southern California businesses as it 
usually does. 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of the agency, department spokeswoman Gail Rubin says the state is 
being sensitive. As an example, she says, New Mexico's business recruiters are 
refraining from calling California businesses for the next few weeks. History 
Lesson 
</P>
<P>
 Has the earthquake's destruction resulted in a new definition of what we can 
consider a landmark? 
</P>
<P>
 It might have, if one real estate ad is an indication. It offers to sell the 
"industry landmark" former Pathe/Cannon Film Group Building in Beverly Hills, a 
relatively new office whose main notoriety may be that it was once owned by one 
of Hollywood's most controversial executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Cannon and Pathe were headed by Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier 
whose financial troubles prompted the French Bank Credit Lyonnais to seize the 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio from him in 1992. Parretti was later jailed in Italy 
for tax fraud but is believed to be out now. Briefly . . .

 An 8-by-10-inch autographed cast photo from "Gilligan's Island" is being

 Antitrust Lawsuit Against Airline Dismissed: A federal bankruptcy court 
dismissed an antitrust lawsuit against Alaska Airlines by a smaller carrier, 
Seattle-based Alaska Air said.The suit, filed by MarkAir more than two years

in a statement. A separate suit filed by MarkAir against Alaska, alleging 
breach of contract and other charges, is still pending in state superior court 
in Anchorage. MarkAir has accused Alaska of reneging on an agreement whereby

H-II ROCKET MAY LAUNCH JAPAN AEROSPACE FIRMS; TECHNOLOGY: THOUGH THE ULTIMATE 
RESULT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, THE NATION HAS BECOME THE NEWEST PLAYER IN THE SPACE 
GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Japan's first domestically designed major rocket roared into space 
Friday, it marked a great leap upward for the country's aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 What that leap will ultimately bring, however, remains mostly a mystery even 
to the people who built and launched the H-II rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 An expanded role for Japan in space research is a virtual certainty. A strong 
foray into the commercial satellite launch business is a possibility but by no 
means guaranteed. Military applications could come someday, but Japan has a 
strong political commitment against development of a missile strike force -- 
and the H-II is not really the right kind of rocket for that purpose anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, the new rocket simply makes Japan the world's newest 
independent player in the space game. For now, at least, that alone is enough 
to satisfy Japan's National Space Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful liftoff ends "a quarter-century approach run," said Tomifumi 
Godai, executive director of NASDA's Launch Vehicle Development and Operation 
division. "Now we mark the beginning of activity to lead the world." 
</P>
<P>
 In technical terms, the H-II seems to be world-class. Its engine is broadly 
modeled on the U.S. space shuttle engine but designed and built, like the rest 
of the rocket, entirely with Japanese technology. The rocket is relatively 
powerful for its weight, compared to rockets of a similar class built by other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the H-II has one huge drawback: its price. At $170 million a shot, it is 
one and a half to two times as expensive as key rockets in the world used for 
commercial satellite launches, such as the Ariane rocket of France-based 
Arianespace or General Dynamics' Atlas and McDonnell Douglas' Delta. And 
without winning commercial deals to put satellites in orbit, the 74 Japanese 
firms involved in building the H-II will have a tough time making much money 
from their project. 
</P>

 The H-II blasted off shortly after sunrise Friday from the Tanegashima Space 
Center on Tanega Island, 23 miles off the coast of Kyushu, the southernmost of 
Japan's four main islands. The launch had been postponed since Tuesday morning, 
first due to bad weather, then because of problems with an air duct. The 
liftoff was delayed 20 minutes when a fishing boat entered a restricted zone 
below the flight path. 
</P>
<P>
 The 260-ton rocket, which is about 14 stories tall, carried a research 
satellite and an experimental re-entry vehicle designed to test heat-resistant 
carbon and ceramic materials for a future unmanned Japanese space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Orbital Re-Entry Experiment" vehicle (dubbed OREX) circled the Earth 
once, then splashed down on schedule just south of the Equator in the central 
Pacific Ocean about 130 minutes after launch. 
</P>
<P>
 NASDA developed the H-II at a cost of $2.5 billion. Japan's determination to 
build its own rocket is based partly on national pride and partly on a desire 
not to be dependent on the United States for the ability to put payloads into 
space. Previous Japanese rockets incorporated U.S. technology, which gave 
Washington a voice in their use. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you transfer technology, the restrictions are very severe," Tokyo 
University professor Shigefumi Saito explained in an interview aired by NHK 
Television. "When U.S. engineers came to Tanegashima (more than a decade ago), 
NASDA engineers weren't even allowed to observe their work. For engineers, that 
was a humiliation. This became a very strong motive force. It made us think we 
had to develop for ourselves the things we need." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially influential, Saito said, was a 1980 incident when an experimental 
Japanese satellite went off course and became lost in space. The problem seemed 
to be with the satellite's small engine. But the engine was U.S.-made, and 
Japanese engineers were not allowed even to examine its blueprints to try to 
figure out what went wrong. The H-II rocket program was started a few years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan now has ambitious long-term plans in space, including hopes for 
cooperation with the United States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking into the 21st Century, prospects for space stations and a moon base 
lie in front of the Japanese people and the people of the world," Yasunobu 
Matogawa, a Space Sciences Institute professor, told NHK. 
</P>
<P>
 While Japan's space research program will continue to be directed by NASDA, 
the work of building rockets and handling commercial satellite launches will be 
turned over to Rocket Systems Corp., a private firm established in 1990 by 74 
of Japan's leading companies. But NASDA plans first to conduct another 
experimental H-II launch this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of Rocket Systems Corp., according to Executive Vice President 
Hiroshi Imamura, are five key firms: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Kawasaki 
Heavy Industries Ltd., NEC Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Ishikawajima-Harima 
Heavy Industries Co. These are the same firms that have played key roles in 
building the various components of the H-II. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket Systems Corp. and the H-II rocket itself have a guaranteed future 
because of NASDA's need for launch vehicles. But making the rocket a commercial 
success will be an immense challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's successful launch removes what Imamura called the "biggest wall" 
blocking his firm from conducting a profitable commercial satellite launch 
business -- the lack of a rocket. But the current $170-million cost of building 
an H-II rocket must be cut by 30% to 50% before it can compete for 
international business, Imamura said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to reduce the price by manufacturers' efforts," he said. "If we 
can't do it, this rocket will not enter the commercial field." 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of the world satellite launch business is currently held by 
Arianespace, which has had 57 successful launches and six failures. The latest 
failure came last month, when an Ariane rocket crashed after takeoff from a 
site in French Guiana, ending a string of 27 consecutive successes. Some future 
combination of troubles in other countries' launch programs and a sharp 
increase in demand for satellites could increase the importance of the H-II 
even if it remains a relatively expensive vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The H-II was plagued by various problems during its development, including two 
explosions -- of an engine and of an engine part -- that delayed the launch by 
two years. But its makers hope that high reliability will ultimately become a 
strong selling point.

 Senator Seeks More Loans for Small Businesses: California Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein has introduced a bill to fund a small-business loan program that she 
hopes will help create 400,000 jobs nationwide for people who are out of work 
because of Defense Department cuts."California has suffered the biggest hit 
from defense downsizing and base closures," Feinstein said. "Every county in 
Greater Los Angeles has been affected by defense downsizing." The legislation 
will use $100 million in Small Business Administration loan guarantees to 
leverage $4 billion in private sector loans to businesses affected by defense 
cutbacks and military base closures, she said. Feinstein estimated that by 1998 
California will have lost 650,000 jobs because of the military cuts.

 Former Nintendo Workers to Receive Aid: Laid-off Nintendo of America employees 
are the nation's first to qualify for federal help under the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. The Labor Department ruling covered 136 workers laid off 
by the video game maker on Jan. 11, 10 days after the agreement between the 
United States, Mexico and Canada was implemented. Workers who lose their jobs 
when their employer moves operations to Mexico or Canada between Dec. 8, 1993, 
and Sept. 30, 1994, qualify for federal job-search and retraining services and 
extended jobless benefits.

 Insurance Con Artist Convicted: St. Louis businessman Arthur Blumeyer III, who 
ran a web of fraudulent insurance firms that fleeced consumers in California 
and elsewhere, was found guilty of fraudulently obtaining more than $43.5 
million in premiums, U.S. Atty.Edward L. Dowd Jr. announced. A jury in U.S. 
District Court in St. Louis convicted Blumeyer, 50, of 27 felony counts 
including conspiracy, wire fraud, mail fraud and money laundering. In the late 
1980s, after California officials issued a cease-and-desist order against one 
Blumeyer company, Bel-Aire Insurance, he shifted business into another, 
Atlantic General Insurance, Dowd said. It is unknown how much of the phony 
coverage was sold in California.

 China's Inflation Rate Soars: A spending spree to welcome the Year of the Dog 
will push China's inflation rate to a new high in the first three months of 
this year, even as new restrictions on lending cut back construction work, the 
official China Daily reported. The State Information Center, the nation's 
leading forecasting unit, expects the retail price index to hit an annual rate 
of 14.5% in the first quarter, compared to a 13% rate for the whole of last 
year, the paper said.

 Compaq Joins Subnotebook PC Field: Compaq Computer Corp. will begin selling a 
3 1/2-pound personal computer with a base price of $1,400.The computer, called 
the Contura Aero, has a very quiet keyboard and backlit screen. It can run up 
to six hours with a rechargeable battery. Houston-based Compaq, the 
third-largest maker of personal computers, is a latecomer to the market for 
subnotebooks, machines that weigh less than five pounds. International Business 
Machines Corp. is advertising a subnotebook from $1,300, and a comparable 
machine by Gateway 2000 Inc. sells for $1,500. Compaq is aiming the product at 
students, journalists, sales representatives and executives who travel, and 
attorneys for courtroom use.

 Currency Reforms Could Damage Yuan, Bank Report Says: The government may have 
been hasty when it introduced its recent currency reforms, according to the 
report from Hang Seng Bank.China abolished its artificially high exchange rate 
of 5.72 yuan to the U.S. dollar Jan. 1, adopting a rate offered at "swap 
centers," where foreign and state companies exchange yuan profits for hard 
currency. The exchange rate, which is set by supply and demand for dollars and 
yuan, has been hovering at about 8.72. China's timing for the changes could 
have been better, the bank said in its monthly newsletter. With urban inflation 
running at about 20%, the value of the yuan will be under pressure, it said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; THE DOOR'S OPEN, BUT DON'T EXPECT A STAMPEDE; VIETNAM: U.S. 
FIRMS WILL FACE CHALLENGES FROM BURDENSOME BUREAUCRACY AND EUROPEAN AND ASIAN 
RIVALS ALREADY THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINUS CHUA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vietnam's doors may finally be opened to U.S. businesses, but its lack of 
modern infrastructure and institutions -- along with a head start by investors 
from rival nations -- will make doing business there a challenge for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's announcement Thursday lifting the 19-year embargo on 
Vietnam was well received by American business people who see huge potential in 
a fast-growing market. Major corporations such as Bank of America, American 
Express and United Airlines have announced plans to expand into the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But those firms and others will find red tape and bureaucracy among their 
biggest problems, experts say. Because governmental departments overlap, 
paperwork for permits and licenses is repetitious. Also, the Vietnamese are 
still trying to root out corruption at all levels -- from customs officials to 
police officers to government ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have people making extraordinarily low salaries and who are being 
bombarded by many investors, the temptation (to accept bribes) is there," said 
Phillip D. Grub, professor of international business at George Washington 
University and co-author of "Vietnam: The New Investment Frontier in Southeast 
Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 The same problem exists among Vietnamese businesses. Thomas Mattia, who set up 
Hill & Knowlton Inc.'s public relations operations in Hanoi, recalled how local 
newspapers had rates for both advertising and editorial coverage. You could pay 
to have a news story done on your company -- a practice unacceptable in the 
United States, said Mattia, now executive vice president of Hill & Knowlton's 
Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of infrastructure is another problem. Despite its recent economic growth, 
Vietnam still has a tremendous need for highways, roads, rail lines and airport 
and seaport facilities. Pepsico, which has a facility in Ho Chi Minh City, must 
fly its beverage products to Hanoi because transportation by road is not 
practical. To cut costs and to tap into the growing economy, the company is 
considering a new facility in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal and accounting standards still aren't well established because Vietnam 
remains a developing country. Grub said foreign investment laws are not 
complete and do not apply to all international transactions the same way. This 
leaves room for individual interpretation, especially at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
 Copyright, patent and trademark laws have improved in recent years, but they 
have not been enforced, Grub said, suggesting a demand for international 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 And because Vietnam lacks accounting standards, Western-trained accountants 
are badly needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Grub attributes this to the process of "transforming from a Marxist economy 
with barter trade to a market economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Vietnam opened its doors in the last few years, Asian-Pacific and 
European countries have started multimillion-dollar projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there's room for U.S. companies to expand, they will face competition 
in telecommunications, beer making, food processing and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the price of the delayed entry, and it could be a strong handicap for 
U.S. companies, Grub said. 
</P>
<P>
 With an anticipated increase of U.S. businesses expanding into Vietnam, there 
will be a shortage of housing, especially higher quality housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the low-cost housing that local workers live in will face similar 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, doing business in Vietnam or any developing country doesn't lead to 
quick profits, experts say. Rather, business must be viewed as long-term 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "You absolutely have to take a long-term view in any emerging market," said 
Ken Ross, a spokesman at Pepsico in New York. "It's not a short-term game -- 
you've got to build and be patient."

THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN VIETNAM AREN'T FOR EVERYBODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though the 19-year U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam has been lifted, 
business leaders should not rush headlong into new ventures there, according to 
Thomas M. Timberman, a Washington-based writer and author of "Vietnam: The No 
BS Business Guide."  
</P>
<P>
 Much research and preparation is required to take advantage of opportunities 
there, he says. In an interview with Times correspondent Debora Vrana, 
Timberman offers advice on how to do business in Vietnam, identifies which 
companies are likely to benefit and sounds a warning on potential pitfalls, 
such as picking a joint venture partner.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: What advice would you give a local business person eyeing 
opportunities in Vietnam? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The first thing you must do is research. The last thing you should do 
is get on a jet plane and go to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon. 
There are lots of sharks, and you will be gobbled alive. 
</P>
<P>
 You need to see if there is a niche for you. And very likely there is a niche 
for your company, because this is a country that needs everything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which companies are particularly poised to benefit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: What you hear most about is oil. And there is no doubt that oil is a 
biggie. They have the largest undeveloped oil field in all of Asia. Obviously, 
your average Southern California business person is not going to go in there 
and get a piece of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are a whole range of associated industries needed. If you have a 
successful transportation company or you make cleaning products for oil 
companies or machine parts for oil rigs, you have a big shot at one of the 
largest undeveloped oil fields in the world.  
</P>
<P>
 If you go beyond the oil, you're looking at every kind of business you can 
think of, whether it's repairing computers or selling fax machines and cellular 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction, next to oil, is probably the single biggest opportunity. 
Everything needs to be rebuilt. And this is not a small country. It won't take 
many contracts for the Southern California construction firms to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the downside? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a developing country -- some would say an underdeveloped country -- 
with all the frustrations that come with that. 
</P>
<P>
 It's got a climate that can only be called really, truly dreadful. You're only 
dry a few months of the year. The transportation is also a downside. If you're 
importing or exporting, you have to cope with a Victorian railroad and port 
system. Movement of goods is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Then you come to the bureaucracy. If you take a communist bureaucracy and 
plunk it down in a tropical climate and mix in residual ill will from 40 or 50 
years of war with the West, what you get is not a whole lot of fast-moving 
efficiency. They not only march to a different drummer, they probably don't 
have one. It can be terribly frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Say you've done your homework and determine that opportunities exist for 
you. How do you start? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, then get on the plane and go to Ho Chi Minh City, but go via Hong 
Kong or Bangkok. The business people in those two places are deeply involved in 
Vietnam and have had years of experience you can draw on. Make some 
appointments there, maybe with the Hong Kong-Vietnam Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the things you must do before you leave the United States is hire 
an interpreter-guide. Now, this is not a tourist guide, this is a 30- to 
40-year-old, well- educated person, usually male. You find these people through 
the network of American organizations and law firms that have representatives 
in Ho Chi Minh City. You need someone to grease the skids and get you through 
the linguistic barriers. That's the most effective way of introducing yourself 
to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember, never go to Vietnam the first time for less than three weeks, or 
you'll never get anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've hired a guide. Now what can I expect? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Then get the all-important car and negotiate the price. If you are a 
foreigner, you are not allowed to drive. You have to have a Vietnamese driver. 
You can take a taxi, but if you want to get out of the cities you need a car. 
The trains are nightmarish, and the buses tend to do things like turn over and 
roll off mountains because they are overcrowded. And if you showed up on the 
bus to meet a Vietnamese business person, it would be the last time you ever 
saw them. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's best that you just have your guide you've already hired meet you at 
the airport with the Toyota -- air-conditioned, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there is an organization I have not mentioned yet that is very important: 
the State Committee on Commerce and Industry, always abbreviated as SCCI -- no 
one ever says the full name. They watch foreign investment and business and 
will arrange an interpreter. But we caution people not to forget this is a 
communist country. It still has an active secret police with an extensive 
network. So when you hook up with the SCCI, you are stuck with the person they 
send you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where should a business person stay? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The hotel is very important. That's where you send your faxes, use a 
secretarial service and translate documents. It's important for your image that 
you stay in one of the best hotels. That can get pricey, as the most expensive 
hotel in Ho Chi Minh City is $400 a night. Now, you don't have to stay there, 
but you have to stay in one of the top five, or they will think you aren't 
worth bothering with. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are some key business faux pas you could make in Vietnam? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In Vietnam, a stranger would begin a business conversation with an 
introductory speech, telling where they came from and about their family. The 
last thing you ever do is get down to business. If you push and rush, you will 
find yourself ostracized.  
</P>
<P>
 Also business cards. You can't just take someone's business card and put it in 
your wallet. The custom is to raise it up in the air and say something, such as 
"Oh, you work for this company." Then put it in your pocket, never in your 
purse or wallet. It's that level of detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing your temper is one of the worst things you can do. Coolness and 
correctness, cool fire is as much as you can do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the worst mistake you could make? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you decide that indeed there is a real opportunity there, the biggest 
decision will be the selection of a joint venture partner or a Vietnamese 
associate.  
</P>
<P>
 But you have to be terribly, terribly careful about selecting them. The worst 
thing would be to select the wrong partner. We very strongly advise people to 
be cautious about taking into partnership a Vietnamese American. They are 
wonderful as consultants before you go, but if you want someone on the ground 
in Vietnam, you get someone who is a Vietnamese, not someone who comes with all 
this background. 
</P>
<P>
 If they left the country before 1975 and haven't had an association with the 
place in more than 19 years, their contacts are limited. Also, the people there 
have been suffering significantly, so they don't have a special feeling for 
these people. You should think about this twice or maybe three times. Our 
advice is to opt for the Vietnamese who has grown up under this current system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the business culture there? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You have to remember that doing business or commerce was never highly 
regarded. That's still somewhat of an issue. Also, the business person must 
deal not only with the national government, but with local governments, and 
these do not only overlap, they contradict. It's very unpredictable.

 Firm Joins Race for Asia's Cable TV Viewers: Po Hsin Entertainment Inc. 
announced it will launch Taiwan's first cable channel aimed at the growing 
television audience in the region. Po Hsin, 45% owned by Taiwan's ruling 
Nationalist Party, hopes to begin broadcasting Chinese-language news and 
entertainment throughout China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia in October on the 
Apstar-1 satellite, scheduled to be launched this summer. APT Satellite Co., a 
Beijing-controlled satellite concern based in Hong Kong, signed an agreement 
with Po Hsin to provide the satellite space, in a rare business pact between 
the Nationalist Party and a Mainland-controlled company.

 Cabinet Approves Stock Income Tax Plan: The Finance Ministry proposal to 
reimpose a tax on stock income is now ready for the legislature, where it could 
still be revised, analysts said. Under the plan, individuals who sell more than 
$568,500 worth of stock a year would pay a new 0.6% tax collected at the time 
of a sale.The final tax assessment would be calculated at the end of the year 
based on stock earnings and income tax rates, according to Joe Kao, vice 
president of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Securities. Institutional investors, who 
normally invest in relatively large amounts of shares, would pay a 0.3% tax at 
the time of sale and would be subject to income tax after stock profit is 
determined, Kao said. The Cabinet wants to put the plan into effect July 1.

shuttle services between major cities. India's aviation sector has been closed 
to foreign competition until recently, the paper said. Goh visited India with a 
delegation of business leaders in an effort to strengthen economic ties between 
the two countries.

O.C. ENTERPRISE / DEAN TAKAHASHI: BOOKS ON COMPUTER DISKS GROW IN POPULARITY;

 David Mann turned his passion for reading and his love of computers into a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he co-founded SoftBooks Inc., a Lake Forest company that makes 
electronic books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to be a publisher," said Mann, 36, president of the company. 
"I read about a book a week. I decided to combine my technical and literature 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, a computer consultant who attended UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton, 
teamed up with some friends from UCI to publish books on floppy computer disks 
or CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD-ROM -- compact disc, read-only memory -- is based on the same optical 
technology as the music compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides music, CD-ROMs can store vast quantities of text, video and computer 
animation -- more than 600 times the amount on a typical floppy computer disk 
and enough space for hundreds of books. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic books have been staples in science fiction novels for years. But 
getting people to read CD-ROM books hasn't been easy. A book is something to 
curl up with on the couch; desktop computers aren't so cozy. 
</P>
<P>
 But software companies have begun publishing engrossing titles that take 
advantage of CD-ROMs' dazzling animation and video features. At the same time, 
prices for the CD-ROM drives required to read books electronically have fallen. 
About half of the personal computers sold this year will be equipped with 
CD-ROM drives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The early electronic books focused on quantity, not quality," said Bruce 
Ryon, multimedia analyst for market researcher Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. 
"They put mounds of text on a disk, and little else." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryon isn't predicting the death of the paper book. But CD-ROMs are becoming an 
affordable alternative for some people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 SoftBooks wasn't the first on the market with electronic books. World Library 
Inc. in Garden Grove in 1990 launched the first of its "Library of the Future" 
series, which contains the text of hundreds of books on a single CD-ROM. Such 
works have paved the way for other publishers to go electronic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take your standard paperbound book and add the enhancements of 
multimedia," Mann said. "We complement the paper book by adding dynamic 
interactive lessons, video clips and audio." 
</P>
<P>
 "Quick and Easy Spanish," published in 1991 as the company's first title, has 
2,000 pages of lessons and illustrations, plus about 20 video clips. It sells 
for $49.95.  
</P>
<P>
 The book shows video segments of someone pronouncing a word so that the reader 
can learn proper pronunciation. The books can flip pages automatically and 
repeat lessons that must be memorized. 
</P>
<P>
 With sales of CD-ROM drives gaining momentum, Softbooks is poised to benefit. 
Its seven titles are laid out much like paper books, with pages, indexes and 
tables of contents. Much of the initial work that Mann did was to create an 
interface that is easy to use and also supplies researchers with any necessary 
page and source documentation needed for footnotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our books, you don't need to learn how to use software," Mann said. 
"That's a contrast to companies out there that create complicated software that 
makes you spend more time learning how to use it than reading it. Once a person 
reads one of our books, they pick up any other one." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann is beginning a campaign to get publishers of electronic books to adopt 
his software interface as a standard. He is making his software code available 
to publishers for free so that a simple standard for electronic books can 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the only way we will get more people to read electronic books," he 
said. "We want to use the technology to add features like video and audio, not 
to get them lost in a computer program." 
</P>
<P>
 With his computer program already written for the book format, Mann said, he 
can publish an electronic book within a month after an author approaches him. 
The main chore is electronically typesetting the book, a process for which Mann 
created an automated program. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the formula has spelled success. Though the privately held company 
does not disclose sales or profit figures, Mann said that revenue increases 
have allowed the business to grow consistently. 
</P>

 If your Orange County company has annual sales of less than $10 million, we 
would like to consider it for a future column. Call O.C. Enterprise at (714) 
966-7871.

HOW COURTS VIEW MEDICAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health maintenance organizations occasionally find themselves defending their 
medical decisions in court. These are some of the non-medical factors experts 
say HMOs may consider when determining to whether to cover sensitive cases: 
</P>
<P>
 * Patient demographics.Juries are more likely to be sympathetic to children 
and women than to middle-age men. 
</P>
<P>
 * The illness. A high-profile disease like breast cancer puts an HMO at 
greater risk in court than colon or prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Status of the treatment. An HMO is at greater risk if some doctors believe 
an experimental treatment is worth trying even if chances are slim that it will 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Precedent. A court is more likely to side with the plaintiff if the HMO has 
paid for the procedure for other patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seriousness of the illness. People tend to want HMOs to cover treatments for 
life-threatening conditions even if their contract is vague. 
</P>
<P>
 * Referral. An HMO will be at greater risk as a defendant if a doctor within 
its own plan recommended the treatment than if an outside physician recommended 
it.

 Analyst review: "Rockwell has proven to the world that whatever it does is 
well thought out, and usually very beneficial to the shareholder. It is run by 
some very smart people. The balance sheet is in good shape and it will be 
interesting to see what it does with its cash since its acquisition of 
Allen-Bradley in 1985 is paying off well for it now. The problem with investors 
is that when they hear about an acquisition, they expect to see immediate 
results. But sometimes it takes awhile. Rockwell has done an excellent job 
moving into non-defense industries. It is one of the few companies that has 
done a good job of diversifying. It hasn't gotten bogged down by not knowing 
how to sell to other markets."

INSIDE JOB: OCCUPATION: CREATIVE DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Name: Julie Ann Macias 
</P>
<P>
 Company: Creative Design Consultants 
</P>
<P>
 Job description: "I oversee the creative planning of model home interiors. I 
am responsible for keeping each project on track for the preliminary and final 
presentations. I interact with our clients and supervise a research staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up: "I like the ever-changing nature of the design field. We have 
repeat customers, and that forces me to be even more creative when coming up 
with a design because we don't want to offer the same look twice. That means 
keeping up with what's new in color, texture and customer tastes." 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs down: "It is very demanding to remain focused and bring all the details 
together for a presentation. Sometimes we present our ideas to as many as four 
clients in a week. You have to work well under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Next step: "I have spent a lot of time learning about design, and now I would 
like to learn more about marketing. That involves studying what appeals to 
customers and finding ways to create a memorable aspect for each model home." 
</P>
<P>
 Advice: "It helps to get a variety of experience early in your career. Every 
firm has its own approach, and it's important to know how to achieve a number 
of looks." 
</P>
<P>
 Salary range: Beginning designers start at slightly more than $20,000. Senior 
designers and project managers can earn nearly $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: "When we have a presentation to give, we spend a lot of extra time 
perfecting it. At a busy firm, you are going to put in more than the standard 
workday now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 Educational and training requirements: Community colleges, including Orange 
Coast College in Costa Mesa, offer two-year programs in design. The Fashion 
Institute of Design and Merchandising and UCLA Extension in Los Angeles also 
offer two-year programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Major employing industries: Interior design firms. 
</P>
<P>

JAGUAR GEARING UP TO LEASE USED CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still trying to persuade would-be Jaguar owners that they can trust as well as 
love the cars, the British luxury car maker plans to begin widespread leasing 
of used models within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A reputation for poor quality and oft-told tales of frequent breakdowns has 
been hard to shake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jaguar's quality rankings are improving rapidly under the tutelage of Ford 
Motor Co., which bought the company for $2.5 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dale, president of Jaguar North America, said that when the current 
crop of leased Jaguars returns beginning late this year, a used-leasing program 
should be in place. He refused to estimate the likely monthly payment on a used 
lease but said it would be hundreds of dollars less than the $579 monthly 
payment on a new lease.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: REAL ESTATE FUNDS HELP GROUND YOUR PORTFOLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Oliver has his eye out for the "Texas state bird," and so far he's happy 
to report that he hasn't spotted many. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver isn't talking about mockingbirds -- the Lone Star State's official 
winged creature -- but rather construction cranes, which dominated the skylines 
of Houston and other cities during the boom years of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many construction cranes are a bad sign for Oliver, who runs a real estate 
mutual fund, because they indicate that more supply is coming to market, with 
the potential to depress prices. The fact that construction cranes aren't easy 
to spot these days explains why he's optimistic about real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Several mutual fund groups apparently share this sentiment and have added real 
estate portfolios to their lineups. Four such funds have arrived over the past 
year and a half, boosting the current count to 10. 
</P>

 "Real estate has been in a severe recession in most parts of the country, and 
prices for some properties have dropped below what it would cost to construct 
them," says Bob Benson, portfolio manager of the Boston-based Pioneer Winthrop 
Real Estate Investment Fund, which debuted in October. "With the economic 
rebound, we see an opportunity for appreciation and increasing cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of falling home prices is still fresh in the minds of 
Californians, but there is something to be said for owning a real estate fund 
as a small part of a well-mixed investment portfolio. For starters, real estate 
is a major asset category to which millions of people, despite what they might 
think, don't have adequate diversification. It's one thing to own a home or a 
rental property or two, quite another to have a stake in different geographic 
markets and property types. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate funds typically have holdings in many states, and some take a 
global slant. Major property types include apartment complexes, retail centers 
and industrial parks. Office buildings are also within the investment range, 
although most funds are avoiding this depressed sector right now. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the mutual fund route is a pretty efficient way to own real estate. 
Fund shares can be bought or sold in a day, management and other expenses 
typically run less than 1.5% a year, and funds are open to truly small 
investors -- those with as little as $100 to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other benefits too, including professional management, 
diversification, automatic dividend reinvesting and the ability to hold real 
estate within a tax-sheltered individual retirement account. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual funds don't own individual properties per se, but rather real 
estate-related common stocks, especially real estate investment trusts, or 
REITs. One hallmark of REITs is that they can avoid corporate taxes as long as 
they pass on 95% of their net income as dividends to shareholders. This 
explains why real estate funds offer reasonably attractive yields -- currently 
about 3.5% on average. 
</P>
<P>
 REITs come in various forms. Right now, trusts that manage apartments in the 
Southwest (excluding California) are hot owing to solid economic growth and low 
vacancies that reflect a drop in construction a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson believes Southern California's real estate market has seen the worst 
but probably won't start to recover for another six to 12 months. Oliver, who 
runs the Chicago-based PRA Real Estate Securities Fund, is more negative, 
citing low job formation and high taxation as important drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not you agree with these opinions, a real estate fund can allow you 
to diversify outside of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 While REITs and real estate funds are often purchased by income-seeking 
investors, they shouldn't be considered low-risk. The funds fell 16.9% in 1990, 
for example. It's not misleading to think of them as higher-yielding portfolios 
of small stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, however, declining interest rates have pushed up the value of 
yield-oriented investments, and a drop in new construction has enabled real 
estate prices to begin to recover. Real estate mutual funds finished up 22.6% 
on average in 1993, their third double-digit gain in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 One question now is whether the recent surge in the number of REITs coming to 
market -- not to mention REIT prices -- could point to the emergence of a 
frothy, speculative era. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver thinks not. The reason more REITs debuted in 1993 was that traditional 
financing for the industry has dropped off -- mirroring the retreat of banks, 
thrifts, limited partnerships and other sources of capital, he explains. That 
has forced existing companies to raise cash by selling stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is that the industry is deprivatizing," he says. "If there 
were a lot of new real estate companies forming, we'd be scared to death."

 Investors say they are making progress understanding financial matters, yet 
many are still having trouble with basic concepts, according to a survey of 
employees in 401(k) and similar retirement plans by John Hancock Financial 
Services of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty percent of the 813 people polled considered themselves more 
knowledgeable investors than a year or two ago, and 44% said their employers 
had increased the quantity of investment materials relating to their retirement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But 40% didn't know that balanced funds hold stocks, bonds and cash, and 44% 
didn't know that short-term debt securities are found in money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
 And just 26% correctly answered that the best time to transfer into a bond 
fund is when interest rates are expected to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Respondents were between the ages of 25 and 65 and were contributing money to 
their retirement plan at work.

 Morningstar Mutual Funds, the independent fund rating service based in 
Chicago, has named Fidelity Magellan fund chief Jeff Vinik "manager of the 
year" for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Morningstar's list of the year's top managers honors those who "best 
demonstrated the investment skill, the commitment to shareholders, and the 
courage to differ from the consensus that is necessary for superior long-term 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan, the nation's biggest stock fund, gained 24% last year under Vinik. 
Morningstar also named Edward Owens, manager of the Vanguard Specialized Health 
Care fund, first runner-up, followed by Don Chiboucas of Thomson Opportunity 
fund and Hakan Castegren of the Harbor International and Ivy International 
funds. 
</P>

 The 12.07% average gain logged by California municipal bond funds in 1993 
marked their best showing since a 17.23% return in 1986, Morningstar says.

BMW TAKES ON BRITISH CONNECTION; AUTOMOBILES: THE GERMAN COMPANY HAS SIGNED 
DEALS WITH ROVER AND ROLLS-ROYCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BMW, synonymous with German industrial quality and craftsmanship, is acquiring 
a British taste. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto maker known for status cars made news this past week with the 
purchase of Britain's Rover, the formerly state-owned maker of four-wheel drive 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Less publicized, however, is BMW's other move into the British business world: 
a joint venture with Rolls-Royce -- the jet engine maker, not the luxury car 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 That deal, signed in 1990, returned BMW to its original business of making 
aircraft engines. BMW and Rolls-Royce are each investing $570 million for a 
factory near Berlin to make jet engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Already they have orders totaling $850 million from Gulfstream of Savannah, 
Ga., and Bombardier Inc. of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The BMW trademark, a circle with blue and white quadrants, represents an 
airplane propeller. It reflects what the Bayerische Motoren Werke made in 1916 
under one of its founders, Gustav Otto, son of the developer of the four-stroke 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War I, the Munich-based company had to retreat to making only 
railroad brakes for several years because of treaty restrictions, and World War 
II left its auto and aircraft engine plants in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the setbacks, BMW has clawed its way up the global auto industry with 
farsighted management. The purchase of Rover cars roughly doubled BMW's share 
of the European auto market, disrupting the Europe strategy of Japan's Honda 
Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda holds 20% of the Rover car-making subsidiary and, after 15 years of 
raising Rover quality, suddenly finds itself in an ungainly partnership with 
competitor BMW. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW, which is building a plant in Greer, S.C., to produce sporty two-seaters, 
is the only German car maker to make money in 1993. It is paying British 
Aerospace $1.2 billion for Rover from ample cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination will intensify competition in Europe, said analyst Hans 
Hartmann of the research arm of Dresdner Bank, which is BMW's house bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both BMW and Rover will want to export more intensively into the European 
market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW will be able to add the four-wheel-drive Range Rover to its extensive 
distribution network in the United States, where BMW posted a sales gain in 
1993 that helped offset the dismal German market. 
</P>
<P>
 While the German auto industry overall registered a 23% fall in production to 
3.75 million vehicles last year, BMW kept its production drop to 9.2%, making 
534,000 autos worldwide.

BIG N.Y. FIRMS OFFERING EMERGENCY CHILD CARE TO WORKERS; EMPLOYMENT: A GROWING

 Opening the small, silver door in the dim corridor of the Time & Life Building 
is like opening a door to Oz. Only the faintly lettered "Children's Center" 
provides a clue to what's inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's paintings and crafts decorate the brightly colored year-old 
facility, packed with Time Warner Inc. books, videos, equipment and other 
children's fare. Just a few feet from men and women bustling about in business 
suits, children romp and learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who work for Time Warner Inc. can leave their children here if usual 
care arrangements break down. As an added benefit, they can lunch with their 
child, introduce them to colleagues and show them where mommy or daddy works. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner is among the growing number of companies recognizing the need for 
emergency child care, either in special facilities or at home. Many have 
established programs in response to employee surveys placing emergency care 
among the top three on any list of worker priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies opening facilities in the New York area over the past year 
include Goldman Sachs & Co., Chase Manhattan Corp. as well as a consortium of 
financial companies led by Bankers Trust Co. that includes J.P. Morgan & Co., 
Salomon Brothers Inc., C.S. First Boston Inc. and Swiss Bank Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency centers financed by employers now also exist in Washington, 
Philadelphia and Boston, in what experts in work and family issues say is so 
far mostly an urban East Coast trend. 
</P>
<P>
 For Time Warner and others, the concept is based not on altruism but on 
important business considerations, improving productivity and providing an 
important recruitment and retention tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents an evolution of understanding on the part of employers about 
what most causes stress among their employees," said Robin Hardman of the 
Families and Work Institute, a New York-based research concern. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bankers Trust survey of employees at its Jersey City, N.J., office found 
that about 80% called in sick when their regular child-care arrangements fell 
apart, said Molly Houghton, vice president for human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "Productivity was the issue at hand," she said. "That was the argument for 
senior management." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bank's emergency child-care centers in Jersey City and most 
recently, at the company's lower Manhattan offices across the Hudson River, 
"enhance our standing as an employer of choice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To use any of the centers, parents must preregister and complete 
questionnaires concerning their child's health. Once registered, a parent can 
call usually a week to five minutes before care is needed. Spaces are allocated 
on a first-come-first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Centers are open Monday through Friday. Most limit each child to 20 days of 
center use a year, but make allowances for more time under exceptional 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies provide the service free, although others like Bankers Trust 
charge a token $10 daily fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The facilities have evolved partly in response to changing demographics and 
the changing composition of the labor force. Women, historically the primary 
care givers in the family, are increasingly working outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, women make up 45% of the employed. Of all working women, 40.1% had 
children under 18 in 1993, Labor Department data shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a child's illness or a breakdown in child-care arrangements, 
parents are missing between one and two days of work every three months, says 
Charles Rodgers of the Boston consulting firm, Work-Family Directions Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, grandparents are not there to stand in like they used to -- they are 
more than likely to be employed. Most centers are in urban areas where there 
aren't the extended families more often found in smaller communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor helping to establish the new frontier in work-family programs 
has been the lagging economy. As companies have cut employees in corporate 
restructurings, surviving staffers must carry more weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "An employee's absence has a greater impact on the general work force than it 
did 10 years ago," said Judi Presser, also of Work-Family Directions. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, surviving employees worry about losing days at work when 
colleagues are losing their jobs, said Houghton. 
</P>
<P>
 From the company's vantage point, the environment of job austerity and 
pressure for more productivity has forced managers to look more closely at 
issues such as employee morale and stress levels, Presser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of emergency child care began to get attention in corporate 
America in the late 1980s. The Washington law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & 
Pickering is credited with opening the first center in 1986. Cravath Swaine & 
Moore, a big New York City law firm, began its own program in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hours lost at a law firm are billable, so it was possible to really show the 
effect of lost days on a company's bottom line and quantify the savings," 
Presser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Time Warner center occupies lobby space formerly used by a bank. It opened 
in September, 1992, at a cost of $400,000. Operating expenses run about 
$450,000 a year, said Nancy Platt, the company's manager of work and family 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, with a permanent staff of four and nine teachers on call, can 
accommodate 30 children from 6 months to 12 years and is open from 8:30 a.m. 
until 6:00 p.m. It has averaged about 10 children daily. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, children follow a lesson plan that usually includes free play, 
singing and dancing, reading and special projects, said Patty Maltese, the 
center manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a great place," said Time Warner employee Alison Polton-Simon, 
visiting her 18-month-old daughter Ruth at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon has taken her daughter to the facility three times since it has opened. 
On this particular occasion, her regular baby sitter was sick. 
</P>
<P>
 At Goldman Sachs, the bright, 1,800-square-foot center serves the company's 
4,500 employees and can accommodate as many as 48 children from 3 months to 12 
years old. Operating hours are from 7 a.m. until 7.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase Manhattan had the emergency child-care center in mind when it designed 
its new technology center in Brooklyn, N.Y. The 8,000-square-foot facility cost 
the company $1 million to build and operating expenses run about $500,000 
yearly, said Joy Bunson, a vice president in human resources at Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 That facility, also open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., can accommodate up to 70 
children between 2 months and 12 years of age with a staff of nine, including 
seven teachers.

SPOTLIGHT SHINES ON FOOD STAMP FRAUD; SOCIAL SERVICES: ARRESTS RELATED TO QUAKE 
RELIEF HIGHLIGHT THE BILLION-DOLLAR CHEATING THAT PLAGUES PROGRAM. OFFICIALS 
SAY REPLACING COUPONS WITH A DEBIT CARD MAY CUT LOSSES. 
</P>

<P>
 The recent arrests of 20 people for illegally buying food stamps from 
earthquake victims has focused angry national attention on abuse of emergency 
quake relief. But profiteering from the disaster pales in comparison to the 
billion-dollar fraud that plagues the food stamp program each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some estimates place error, waste and fraud -- from the theft of freshly 
printed coupons stored in warehouses to the selling of coupons for a profit at 
the grocery store -- as high as one in every $7 spent on the program. In Los 
Angeles County, that would amount to $55 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a longstanding problem that has really only been accentuated by 
the earthquake," said Assistant U.S. Atty. George B. Newhouse Jr., who 
supervises the government fraud section in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is so great that county officials want to eliminate food stamp 
coupons entirely by converting to an electronic computer system, in which 
recipients would use plastic debit cards to pay for groceries.  
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, authorities probably would not have bothered with many of the 
so-called "runners" who buy and resell food stamps on the street -- five of 
whom were picked up in late January outside a South-Central Los Angeles 
check-cashing store. Officials say street sales in food stamps are too numerous 
and too low on the fraud chain to warrant the attention of strapped federal 
investigators, a situation that changed only because of public outcry over 
abuses of earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could go out there and arrest 1,000 people for trafficking on the street, 
but when the money to be made is great, there would be another 1,000 on the 
street to take their place," said David F. Dickson, regional inspector general 
for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, charged with investigating food stamp 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The $22-billion food stamp program provides 27 million low-income Americans 
with monthly coupons to buy groceries, and authorities say the vast majority of 
recipients are honest, deserving and law-abiding. But the program also serves 
as the grist for a lucrative black market, with the colorful coupons the next 
best thing to dollars for drug traffickers, gun runners and scam artists from 
Los Angeles to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food stamps have become a second currency on the street," said Ellen Haas, 
assistant secretary of agriculture for food and consumer services. "They are so 
easily available, and it is so easy to intimidate recipients that there has 
grown an underground street crime that involves food stamps in a major way." 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover agents have been offered everything from houses to surface-to-air 
missiles in trade for the coupons, although Haas said drugs, guns and cash are 
by far the most sought-after commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, federal agents won convictions in the largest food stamp fraud 
cases in Southland history, with the owners of two family-run grocery stores 
going to prison for illegal trafficking in more than $20 million worth of food 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim residents David Rodriguez, his wife, Juana, and son Eduardo, and South 
Gate residents Evristo Pereira and his wife, Maria, operated small neighborhood 
markets near Downtown Los Angeles, but were redeeming more food stamps than 
most major supermarket chains, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case, the owner of a Hollywood milk delivery company was 
sentenced to 27 months in prison after pleading guilty to illegally trafficking 
and redeeming $2.3 million in food stamps. Authorities said Michael A. 
Presumido became so wrapped up in running the scheme that he had to give up his 
milk delivery route and devote his attention full time to food stamp 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Los Angeles man was sentenced to 15 months in prison last year after 
he sold $29,400 in food stamps to an undercover agent for $25,000 in cash. 
Agents also found $82,000 in food stamps in the man's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents were aware of trafficking at Broadway and Manchester Boulevard 
for several months, but did nothing to stop the illegal sales until recently 
because they wanted to trace the stamps to a retail store. Runners typically 
unload food stamps by selling the coupons at a discount to an authorized 
grocery store, which in turn redeems them at face value from the federal 
treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We emphasize getting the store owners because without them, the stamps can't 
be used for anything but food," Dickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the federal government's big-dollar approach abruptly changed -- at least 
for now -- when rampant curbside sales in food stamps intended for earthquake 
victims embarrassed the federal program. A Senate hearing on the problem was 
called last week in Washington, and Department of Agriculture officials 
scurried to reassure a restless public that the massive food assistance program 
had not become a reckless waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have said from Day One that the program's integrity is essential," Haas 
said. "Fraud takes benefits away from people who are hungry, and every time 
(the media) write about fraud, public support of the program erodes." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the U.S. attorney's office announced the formation of a federal 
task force, which includes eight federal law enforcement agencies, to 
investigate earthquake-related fraud in food stamps and other government 
assistance. Newhouse, who heads the task force, said the special unit is 
designed to expand the government's focus on big-dollar fraud to include 
street-level crime as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the resulting crackdown on street sales in Los Angeles and 
surrounding counties will do little to combat the biggest fraud problems, local 
and federal officials say; the runners typically carry less than $2,000 in 
illegal food stamps. Los Angeles County distributes $66.4 million in food stamp 
coupons monthly and expects to issue an additional $100 million in emergency 
earthquake-related coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is hoped that the highly visible street-level enforcement will discourage 
new traffickers from entering the crowded resale scene. Officials worry that 
word of unchecked street sales after the earthquake sent the wrong message to 
both honest and dishonest food stamp recipients, in effect recruiting a new 
class of opportunists and scam artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot tolerate the impression on the street that the program is out of 
control," one federal investigator said. "It is undermining public support for 
a program that is very worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the earthquake emergency passes, federal investigators with the 
Department of Agriculture will have little choice but to concentrate once again 
on the most egregious cases of fraud. With just 45 investigators monitoring 300 
federal programs in eight western states, the department is so strapped that it 
plans to hand over some enforcement responsibilities to the county under a 
two-year experiment expected to begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, which is charged with investigating eligibility fraud, will get 
$1.7 million in state and federal money to take on street traffickers as well. 
Although catching the traffickers is a federal job, the state and county have 
agreed to help because they fear the problem has gotten out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million people -- nearly one in eight Los Angeles County residents 
-- depend on food stamps to put meals on the table, making tracking the stamps 
an enormous bureaucratic undertaking. Day in and day out, county officials 
follow thousands of tips and leads to ferret out fraud in eligibility, which 
involves everything from people lying on food stamp applications to recipients 
failing to report new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the fraud may have extended to some county welfare workers, with 
federal authorities investigating tips that county workers had filed false 
claims of their own. At least 19 workers have been referred for possible 
criminal prosecution or administrative discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 County fraud investigators last year uncovered 7,000 cases of food stamp and 
welfare overpayments totaling more than $29.1 million. Many of the cases began 
with a call to the county hot line at (213) 749-4266, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to get a better handle on the abuse, the county last month hired 
70 investigators (for a total of 245) to beef up its early detection program. 
The investigators review applications for food stamps and other federal and 
local assistance and attempt to prevent fraud artists from obtaining benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with stepped-up enforcement, county officials believe that they can put a 
bigger dent in the black market for food stamp benefits by introducing plastic 
debit cards and scrapping the food stamp coupons. Maryland introduced the cards 
statewide last year, and San Bernardino and San Diego counties will become the 
first counties in California to begin using them next year. The program -- 
known as electronic benefit transfers -- allows food stamp recipients to pay 
for groceries at the checkout stand much as other customers use bank or credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need it and want it as soon as possible," said Lisa Nunez, who heads the 
computer division of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social 
Services.  
</P>
<P>
 State welfare officials said they want to monitor the programs in San 
Bernardino and San Diego before authorizing the cards in Los Angeles, where the 
sheer volume of recipients will make the conversion a huge undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland officials say the system is too new to know how much money it is 
saving the state in fraud, waste and mistakes, but they say anecdotal evidence 
has been very positive. Fraud investigators like them because they leave an 
electronic trail of each transaction, said Dale Brown, who heads the program 
for the Maryland Department of Human Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 One Maryland recipient, Bobbie McKinney, 41, a single mother of two, said the 
biggest advantage is the avoidance of long lines for food stamp redemptions and 
the embarrassment of paying with food stamp coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it the poor people's MasterCard," McKinney said. "To me, a lot of 
dignity comes with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has endorsed the idea, recently requiring that all 
states develop plans by 1996 to convert from paper coupons to plastic cards. 
Federal officials want eventually to distribute all public assistance benefits 
-- including welfare, Social Security and military pensions -- on the cards in 
an effort to cut bureaucratic costs associated with shuffling reams of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and local fraud investigators welcome the move to electronic benefits, 
but they warn that the fraud problem will not go away with the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who want to break the law will always find a way to beat the system," 
Dickson said.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; REQUESTS FOR AID LIKELY TO ESTABLISH NEW 
RECORD; RELIEF: AS MORE AFTERSHOCKS CONTINUE TO HIT, OFFICIALS SAY THE NUMBER 
OF VICTIMS SEEKING ASSISTANCE WILL TOP THE TOTAL FROM HURRICANE HUGO.

 As still more aftershocks rolled through Los Angeles, state emergency services 
chief Richard Andrews said during a San Fernando Valley tour Sunday that the 
number of earthquake victims requesting government aid will soon surpass 
304,000, breaking the record set following Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the last inhabitants of the San Fernando Valley's now-closed tent 
shelters for earthquake victims spent their first full day indoors as the 
fiercest rainstorm of the winter approached. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual aftershocks -- a 4.1-magnitude jolt at 5:19 a.m. and another of 3.6 
magnitude two minutes later -- were the largest of more than 100 mostly 
unnoticed ones to shake the region in the 24 hours ending Sunday evening. Both 
were centered two miles east of Granada Hills, part of a diminishing aftershock 
pattern that experts say will continue for years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unsettling welcome for the last handful of residents who had been 
staying outside the Church on the Way in Van Nuys, the valley's last formal 
earthquake tent shelter. On Saturday, anticipating the storm expected to dump 
one to two inches of rain, American Red Cross officials closed the sole tent 
there and urged residents to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews spent the morning in the Valley, touring one disaster assistance 
center at the Winnetka Recreation Center and a Red Cross shelter in Granada 
Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said disaster relief applications from the Northridge quake were 
expected to surpass the prior record of about 304,000 from Hurricane Hugo by 
Sunday or today. "Having this concentrated in portions of two counties is just 
remarkable," the OES director said, comparing the quake's relatively 
concentrated impact to the wide swath of destruction cut by Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tally is complete, Andrews estimated the total number of relief 
applications stemming from the Jan. 17 quake could hit 350,000 to 400,000. At 
the Winnetka center, which has accepted about 6,200 applications, new clients 
still are arriving at a rate of about 200 daily, down from nearly 800 a day 
immediately after the quake, said spokesman Bob Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's aftershocks were the latest of more than 3,600 to hit the region 
since the original 6.6-magnitude Northridge quake. Four of the prior 
aftershocks were magnitude 5 or greater, and Sunday morning's 4.1-magnitude 
shaker was the 44th thus far with a magnitude of 4 or greater, a Caltech 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfectly normal, and these can be expected to continue for years," the 
spokesman said. "There will be more 3s, 4s and there might be even some more 
5s." For example, seismologists have recorded more than 60,000 aftershocks from 
the Landers and Big Bear earthquakes of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials reported no additional major damage from the latest aftershocks. But 
they voiced concern that heavy rains could further damage buildings with leaks, 
drive more residents into shelters, and prompt flash-flooding and mudslides in 
areas ravaged by the quake and last year's fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty big, a lot bigger than the last one," said meteorologist Dean 
Jones of WeatherData Inc. in Wichita, Kan., of the expected storm. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare, Los Angeles County firefighters boosted the number of crews on 
duty and readied sand-filled dump trucks for emergency use for sandbagging in 
mudslide-prone areas. Also, the Fire Department's swift-water rescue team was 
placed on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the coming storm that prompted the American Red Cross on Saturday to 
close the last two of what had been up to 14 formal tent shelters, said 
spokeswoman Peggy Hinz. Only a few people had remained in the single tent at 
the Van Nuys church, but about 100 were moved from the two tents at Le Conte 
Junior High School in Hollywood, Hinz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Red Cross officials had erected the large tents outside some of 
their indoor shelters because many residents came seeking aid who were 
reluctant to stay indoors in the wake of the earthquake. Hinz said there never 
was a shortage of space indoors at the Red Cross' shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Southern California, though, officials conceded that many people 
remain in their own tents, either outside damaged homes or at schools and 
parks. To reach them, disaster assistance workers have been venturing into 
hard-hit neighborhoods, encouraging residents to seek help at government 
assistance centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews, the state emergency head, said the 20 fixed-site and 13 mobile 
disaster assistance centers operating in Los Angeles and Ventura counties 
probably will remain open for several more weeks. A 21st fixed-site assistance 
center is due to open Tuesday at the Toberman Recreation Center in the 
Pico-Union area southwest of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal and state officials gave the following quake update: 
</P>
<P>
 * Around Southern California, nearly 3,000 people remained in 23 shelters, 22 
operated by the American Red Cross and one by the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 * 286,268 victims have been registered for state and federal assistance, 
either at disaster application centers or by a toll-free telephone number, 
(800) 462-9021. 
</P>
<P>
 * 31,258 temporary housing checks, totaling $97.8 million, have been issued to 
help victims with rent and other housing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 890 home and commercial loans, valued at $28.6 million, have been approved 
by the U. S. Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross said it has housed 23,872 people at 47 shelters that have been 
open at various times since the earthquake. The Red Cross also has served more 
than a million meals from shelters and 127 mobile food vans. The agency said it 
has spent more than $3.6 million and expects to spend a total of $36 million.

BUILDING ON FAITH; CHURCHES: DESPITE QUAKE AND RECESSION, EXPANSION PLANS AT 
SEVERAL SITES ARE MOVING AHEAD. 
</P>

 The congregation sat outdoors Sunday on folding chairs for a chilly morning 
service on a Pacoima knoll. 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't forced outside by the Northridge earthquake -- which has damaged 
dozens of houses of worship in the San Fernando Valley. The occasion was the 
congregation's first service on the site of what will be a new, $1-million 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're outside because you want to be, not because the ground is shaking," 
Pastor C. Jessel Strong told 100 members of Parks Chapel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The lingering recession and the destructive earthquake have put the expansion 
plans of many churches on hold, but Parks Chapel AME is among at least three 
black congregations in Pacoima with ambitious building plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are witnesses to the God who has brought us to this point and who has 
faith in us," Strong told churchgoers. 
</P>
<P>
 The service and a groundbreaking ceremony later in the day celebrated the 
persistent hope of Parks Chapel AME Church congregants to overcome seven years 
of frustration to build a new church and eventually leave their cramped rented 
quarters at the Oddfellows Hall in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Another congregation closer to such a goal is Paradise Church of God in 
Christ, which is one month away from opening its $245,000 building in Pacoima. 
The Jan. 17 earthquake broke two windows in the 500-seat Paradise church, but 
Pastor Emmanuel Knight said if anything, the quake helped the church by 
bringing people closer together. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Greater Community Missionary Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dudley 
Chatman is senior pastor, the congregation has hired a contractor to build a 
two-story building for educational and community activities on two large lots 
that the Pacoima church bought and paid off over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church community will go forward," Chatman said. "The churches are 
confident that the community is solid, virile and worth the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual for a congregation to be planning for new buildings -- -- 
Chatman mentioned two Baptist churches in nearby San Fernando and Lake View 
Terrace raising money for building funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the church is widely acknowledged as a vital social glue in African 
American communities, especially congregations with their own buildings and the 
image of a stable institution. By building new houses of worship despite hard 
times, these churches are making a statement about the roles they intend to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once this church is built, then we have to build lives," Strong reminded his 
open-air congregation Sunday. "Unless the church is healing and raising people 
from the muck, we sit here in vain, we are worthless." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks Chapel AME, like the large First AME Church of Los Angeles pastored by 
the Rev. Cecil (Chip) Murray, is part of a denomination with a strong social 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong said that Los Angeles city officials have approved architectural plans 
for a building that will include a 350-seat sanctuary, classrooms and a 
fellowship hall at 11070 Borden Ave. A contractor was hired last week, but no 
starting date has been set for construction, the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the 300-member Parks Chapel AME bought the present site overlooking 
Pacoima and planned to build a church there within 18 months, but a dispute 
with a contractor dashed those hopes, said Strong, who has been the pastor 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the closest we've ever been to a new church," said Charolyn Jones of 
Pacoima, a member since she joined the church as a youth in 1957. "I believe it 
is going to be built." 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Paradise Church of God in Christ on Herrick Avenue, barbecues are held 
every Saturday and the 200-member congregation holds a variety of fund-raising 
events in anticipation of moving into its new home March 13. Members will march 
that day from a gymnasium at a city park where they have been renting worship 
space for $1,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rent payments will end, Knight said that the congregation has 
$2,900 monthly payments on a high-interest mortgage plus payments on another 
lot and utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great test of our faith," said the 48-year-old pastor, whose 
congregation is affiliated with the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination. 
Knight said that the 500-seat church, which has no separate rooms for classes 
or other meetings, was built partly with volunteer labor because the church's 
$100,000 loan did not cover all building costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake was only a minor worry compared to the financial part," Knight 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, attendance and membership has been up since the earthquake, and 
people are showing more love and concern for each other since then."

CREWS BRACE FOR POSSIBLE MUDSLIDES; DISASTER: TWO AFTERSHOCKS STARTLE SLEEPERS. 
OFFICIALS URGE TENT DWELLERS TO MOVE INDOORS AS STORM MOVES IN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A day after being buffeted by a pair of strong aftershocks, the Southland is 
bracing for the strongest storm of the winter season today, increasing the risk 
of mudslides and flash-flooding in fire and quake-ravaged regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Storm preparations come as the area is still jittery from two aftershocks 
early Sunday that roused quake-weary residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, at 5:19 a.m., measured magnitude 4.1, a Caltech seismologist said. 
It was the 44th aftershock to register 4.0 or higher since the Jan. 17 
earthquake, and was followed by a second jolt at 5:22 a.m. that measured 3.6. 
Nearly one-fourth of the 3,600 measurable aftershocks have registered 3.0 or 
better. The two tremors, which caused no apparent damage, were centered about 
two miles east-northeast of Granada Hills, according to Caltech seismologist 
Kate Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the storm, which arrived Sunday night, is expected to unload one to 
two inches of rain in the Los Angeles Basin, with even more precipitation 
expected in the mountains, where as much as a foot of snow may fall above the 
4,000-foot level. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty big, a lot bigger than the last one," said meteorologist Dean 
Jones of WeatherData Inc., in Wichita, Kan. "There could be flash-flooding and 
mudslides, especially in the areas hit by the October fires, where the land is 
still barren. Heavy rains in those areas could cause some problems." 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of the storm, Los Angeles County firefighters have put more 
crews on duty and readied two sand-filled dump trucks for emergency sandbagging 
in mudslide-prone areas. The department's swift-water rescue team has been 
placed on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm was also expected to churn up high tides and surf on west-facing 
beaches today, making swimming and surfing risky, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cooperative Medfly Project said Sunday that any rains today would delay 
until at least Tuesday the aerial spraying of malathion over an 18-square-mile 
area of Corona. The controversial pesticide spraying was scheduled for tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the storms, quake victims who are still living in makeshift homes 
and tents are being urged to seek cover at Red Cross permanent shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 American Red Cross officials reported Sunday that they had closed the last two 
of what had been more than a dozen formal tent shelters after persuading the 
residents to move indoors. Red Cross spokeswoman Peggy Hinz said a handful of 
residents remaining at the large tent at Church on the Way in Van Nuys moved to 
indoor shelters, and about 100 from the Le Conte Junior High School shelter in 
Hollywood were taken by van to two indoor shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Red Cross officials had erected the large tents outside some of 
their indoor shelters -- not because of a shortage of indoor space, but because 
many who came seeking aid were reluctant to stay indoors in the wake of the 
earthquake. But the expected heavy rains led Red Cross officials to hasten the 
phase-out of their tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Around Southern California, officials conceded that many people remain 
outdoors, living in their own smaller tents, either outside damaged homes or at 
schools and parks. Disaster assistance workers have been venturing into 
hard-hit neighborhoods to reach them, encouraging them to seek help at 
government disaster assistance centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also said 26 shelters run by the American Red Cross and the 
Salvation Army remain open, housing about 3,000 people. The Red Cross reported 
that it has housed a total of 23,872 people, at a total of 47 shelters, since 
the earthquake. The Red Cross also served more than a million meals at the 
shelters and from 127 mobile food vans. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency reported that it has spent more than $3.6 million in various quake 
relief efforts and expects to spend a total of $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At a daily briefing on earthquake relief efforts, federal and state officials 
reported that so far: 
</P>
<P>
 * 286,268 victims have registered for state and federal assistance, either at 
disaster application centers or via a toll-free "tele-registration" telephone 
number, (800) 462-9021. Outreach workers are continuing their efforts to 
identify the many victims who have not applied for help, said Jose Bravo, 
deputy federal coordinating officer for the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 31,258 federal temporary housing checks, totaling $97.8 million, have been 
issued to help victims with rent and other housing needs. "We're seeing record 
speed in getting people housing," said Paul Flores, deputy director of the 
state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 890 home and commercial loans, valued at $28.6 million, have been approved 
by the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the disaster relief applications from the Northridge quake were 
expected to surpass the record of 304,000 from Hurricane Hugo by Sunday or 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an overwhelming demand for help, a disaster application center in 
the Pico-Union area will open at 1 p.m. Tuesday at the Toberman Recreation 
Center, 1725 Toberman St. The center will be open until 7 p.m. Tuesday and from 
9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials initially moved a temporary mobile office into the area, 
expecting to help about 200 people over a few days. But the mobile unit's staff 
has so far served more than 1,300 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toberman site is the 21st assistance center opened by relief officials. 
Another 13 mobile units are serving smaller communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims can apply for a number of federal, state and local assistance 
programs at the centers. In addition to FEMA officials, representatives from 
various other agencies, including the Small Business Administration and the 
Department of Motor Vehicles, help staff the centers.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; STARTING OVER AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the quake-ravaged Cal State Northridge campus, administrators decided 
shortly after the first big aftershock that rather than reassessing damage 
after each jolt, they would abandon permanent buildings altogether for the 
duration of the spring semester. So students who return to the university today 
will study in portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last weekend, crews working around the clock had erected 50 such 
temporary structures. CSUN administrators are expecting 350 more bungalows by 
Feb. 14, when the school's 25,000 students will resume classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be quite a feat to get them in here, but we're going to do it," 
said Bruce Erickson, a CSUN spokesman. "We're laying out an entire new city." 
</P>
<P>
 Teams of workers are setting up the new structures wherever they can, starting 
at the campus music field on Nordhoff Street and moving north through the 
campus across Devonshire Street. And rather than taking the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's suggestion of numbering the buildings, CSUN officials 
decided to name them. So far, they have designated one cluster of bungalows 
"Zelzah Court." Another is "Music Lawn." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the buildings, which are expected to cost between $5 million and $6 
million, will be configured into 251 classrooms, eight 200-person lecture halls 
and 29 restroom buildings. The remainder of the buildings will house 
administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bungalow city is complete, it will accommodate more than 14,000 
students at one time, Erickson said. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First came the flood, then came the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning was sounded at 11:15 a.m. -- by a man named Revere, the caretaker 
of the massive Baldwin Hills Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Dec. 14, 1963, and people were still talking about President John F. 
Kennedy's assassination three weeks before. Residents were preparing for the 
holidays, and Revere G. Wells was on his rounds when he heard water gurgling 
through a leak somewhere in the Baldwin Hills Reservoir, which supplied water 
for 100,000 to 500,000 residents from mid-Los Angeles to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 He searched, discovering a crack in the 12-year-old dam about the width of a 
pencil. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three hours, as residents were frantically evacuated from the water's 
likely path, the crack had become a 75-foot-wide hole, unleashing 292 million 
gallons of water that gushed from the base of the dam at Cloverdale Avenue, and 
slammed into homes in its path. Most residents were alerted to the evacuation 
by the police or through news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The water roared onward, moving down steep hills in a fan-shaped path of 
destruction, to Rodeo Road between La Cienega Boulevard and La Brea Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 When the flood stopped 77 minutes later, five people had drowned, 8,000 people 
had been driven from their homes, 65 houses had been destroyed, more than 210 
other apartments and houses had been seriously damaged and $12 million in 
damage had been racked up. 
</P>
<P>
 The hillside community had first become a household word in 1932, when it was 
the site of the Olympic Games' first-ever Olympic Village. But the dam tragedy, 
and another disaster in 1985, left the public with a different memory of the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 2, 1985, only blocks from the dam disaster, tragedy struck Baldwin 
Hills again. Flames roared up the hillside from road flares an arsonist had 
laid on a weed-filled hillside near La Brea Avenue just north of Stocker 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze ripped through seven streets of the Baldwin Hills community, 
consuming 48 homes, damaging 18 others, causing $16 million in damage and 
leaving three people dead, including the mother of a firefighter who lived 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The name of both the area and the dam that served it date to the 19th Century, 
to a man named Elias Jackson (Lucky) Baldwin, a colorful entrepreneur who lived 
with an opulent disregard for Victorian conventions, and was said to have 
survived two murder attempts by jilted lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Baldwin bought the property, it had been part of the 4,000-acre Rancho 
La Cienega, owned by Vicente Sanchez, the alcalde, or mayor, of Los Angeles in 
1830. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sanchez died, the property was taken over by an heir, Tomas A. Sanchez, 
the sheriff of Los Angeles County for nearly 10 years. Sanchez sold the ranch 
and it eventually was purchased by Baldwin -- who died in 1909, thinking that 
the ranch was a white elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't have been more wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, Olympic planners found the empty land an ideal site on which to build 
the Olympic Village, home base for 2,000 visiting athletes. Not only was it 
less than four miles from the Coliseum, but its hillside location made it 10 
degrees cooler than the city below. 
</P>
<P>
 Five miles of streets were wrapped around the hills, and alongside them 500 
trim, pink-and-white prefabricated cottages were erected. The Olympic village 
innovation grew partly out of Depression-era concerns that some nations would 
be forced to pass up the Olympics because they could not afford to house their 
athletes during the games. 
</P>
<P>
 After the games, the cottages were knocked down. The Baldwin estate was 
eventually subdivided and developed with costly houses that by the late 1940s 
were making Baldwin Hills a well-to-do enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the area bears little evidence of the torrents that once swept it, or 
of the fire that ravaged it years after. 
</P>
<P>
 No cause was ever found for the reservoir rupture. But like the fire, it 
created a lasting legal legacy: 
</P>
<P>
 The city claimed that oil drilling had weakened the dam's substructure over 
several years. Oil company engineers blamed the deluge on a shift of the 
Newport-Inglewood Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and oil companies finally settled with the property owners out of 
court for $13 million in 1970. Most of the houses were rebuilt and roads 
repaired. But the reservoir was left empty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1985 fire, investigators found the remains of several road flares that 
an arsonist used to ignite the 10-acre firestorm on a weed-filled hill then 
owned by Pepperdine University. A $35,000 reward was offered by the city and 
state for information leading to a conviction, but the crime remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, homeowners and Pepperdine blamed each other for negligence in not 
keeping the land cleared of brush. Some of the 90 lawsuits were finally 
combined and resolved, and others were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, what was once the 19-acre reservoir has been partially filled in with 
earth, grass and trees to extend the 300-acre park named after the area's 
retired county supervisor, Kenneth Hahn. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

BULLET-RESISTANT STREET LIGHTS GET SHINING REVIEWS; CRIME: PLASTIC MATERIAL 
USED TO PROTECT BANK TELLERS COULD REDUCE DRAIN ON CITY COFFERS CAUSED BY 
RECURRING VANDALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Drug dealers and other nefarious types who take shots at street lights so they 
can carry out their dirty deeds in the shadows have a new enemy: 
bullet-resistant street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an idea that Los Angeles' Bureau of Street Lighting has tested on about a 
dozen street lights throughout the city to prevent criminals from darkening 
neighborhoods. So far, the results have been glowing. 
</P>
<P>
 On gang-plagued Blythe Street in Panorama City, one street lamp that was 
regularly taken out of commission by gunshots was fitted with the shield. It 
has been illuminating the street for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been shot down yet so it has helped out," said Jean Green, the Los 
Angeles Police Department's senior lead officer for Blythe Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet-resistant shields on street lights -- made of the same plastic 
material used to protect bank tellers -- are the latest effort to reduce an 
annual $166,000 drain on the city's coffers because of street-lamp vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, more than 15 street lights in the city are shot out or broken by 
rocks, said Robert Holden, a street-light supervisor. And almost as often, 
vandals break concrete light posts to cut the electrical wires, he said. Metal 
shields now are welded to the post to protect the wires. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the inch-thick bullet-resistant shields are expensive -- $130 per 
light -- replacing shot-out street lights can cost as much as $500 per light. 
City officials consider the shields a money-saving alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Green said drug dealers tend to shoot out lights on small residential streets 
or alleys where they have a regular drug trade, lessening the chance that they 
will be observed by neighbors or police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The darker the street, the more crime that can occur on the street," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Prats, a city street-lighting engineer, said the problem in certain 
crime-plagued neighborhoods has been so bad that "on the same day we replace 
street lights, they shoot them out again." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the bullet-resistant shields originated at neighborhood meetings 
involving police, street-lighting officials and residents of crime-plagued 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is when someone said: 'When are you going to bring in bulletproof street 
lights?' " Prats said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shields are not completely impenetrable, he said they withstand 
the blast of most guns. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be too expensive to install the shields on all 225,000 street lights 
citywide. Prats said the shields have only been installed on street lamps that 
have been shot out five or six times, most of which are located in Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But as word spreads about their effectiveness, Prats expects an increase in 
requests for the shields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling that as time goes on we are going to discover more spots. . 
. where there is a need to put the shields," he said.

MAN SHOT DURING DISPUTE IN PACOIMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was shot and seriously wounded during an argument on a Pacoima street 
early Sunday morning, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name was not released, was allegedly shot by Laborio 
Cassillas, 39, after he struck and injured Cassillas during an argument in 
front of 11803 Glenoaks Blvd. about 1 a.m. Sunday, said Officer Lorie Taylor, 
an LAPD spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses chased down Cassillas and held him until authorities arrived. He was 
arrested at the scene, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two victims down on the ground when officers arrived," Taylor 
said. "Ends up one was shot by the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassillas, who was being treated at County-USC Medical Center, has been 
charged with attempted murder, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who was shot was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were in stable condition Sunday.

FEW ATTEND MEETING ON ROBERTI RECALL; POLITICS: ORGANIZERS SAY THEY'RE 
UNDAUNTED IN THEIR EFFORT TO FORCE THE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM VAN NUYS OUT OF 
OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only about a dozen people turned up Sunday at a meeting to organize a recall 
of state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), including several who were either 
candidates seeking to replace him or representatives of other political 
wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 But recall leaders said they were undaunted by the tiny turnout, saying they 
believe that they will succeed in throwing Roberti out of office April 12, less 
than nine months before he must leave anyway under term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Roberti forces last month qualified the recall election for the ballot, 
submitting more than 23,000 valid voter signatures. The recall marks only the 
fourth time since 1912 that such an initiative has reached the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall leaders have criticized Roberti for "buying" his Van Nuys seat in an 
expensive 1992 campaign after he was reapportioned out of his old, 
Hollywood-based district. They also have attacked him for appointing as 
committee chairmen three other senators later convicted on corruption charges 
and for his sponsorship of a landmark 1989 ban on semiautomatic assault guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Dominguez, who chairs the recall group, said he was not discouraged 
because the group also has discussed possible partnerships with Californians 
for Law and Order, a statewide group, as well as the group backing the "Three 
Strikes You're Out" initiative, which seeks to make life sentences mandatory 
for people convicted of three felony crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez and Dolores White, the recall group's secretary, have filed to be 
candidates if the recall succeeds. Their names will appear on the same ballot 
with Roberti's. 
</P>
<P>
 John Popp, 58, of Reseda, who belongs to Ross Perot's United We Stand, 
America, organization and the National Rifle Assn., as well as the recall 
group, said the turnout was typical of the voter apathy that has allowed 
corruption and incompetence to flourish in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we can fill this room and have people standing in line to get into this 
place, people have got the kind of government they deserve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main theme at the recall meeting, held in the auditorium of the Encino 
Community Center, was to rid the state Legislature of Roberti and replace him 
with a candidate representing the recall group, known formally as the Coalition 
to Restore Government Integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides those seeking Roberti's job, several people representing candidates 
for other offices took the opportunity to stump for a few votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Forsch, a Republican candidate for the seat of Rep. Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City), said he came to lend support to the "Dump Dave" backers, and 
troll for some votes of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott Graham, who heads the Los Angeles County chapter of the American 
Pistol and Rifle Assn., came to represent John Stites, who is running against 
Sheriff Sherman Block. Another man supporting Richard Sybert, a Woodland Hills 
businessman running for Congress, came in the hopes of winning votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the recall effort, Roberti has criticized his opponents for their 
ties to anti-gun control organizations, which have denounced his successful 
efforts to ban semiautomatic assault guns.

 Roberti aides have said they respect such special interest groups, especially 
in low voter turnout special elections. The recall group needs a simple 
majority to remove Roberti, who would be replaced by one of eight candidates 
whose names will appear on the recall ballot with him.

SUSPECTED PIPE BOMB CLOGS TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drivers on the San Diego and Ventura freeways were delayed for more than an 
hour Sunday after a suspected pipe bomb was discovered on the San Diego Freeway 
and authorities later blew it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol closed all lanes of the San Diego Freeway near 
Burbank Boulevard after a Caltrans worker discovered what looked like a pipe 
bomb on the road's northbound right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad was summoned to examine the 
4-inch-long aluminum pipe, which was covered with black tape, and decided to 
destroy it in a special container, said Officer Lorie Taylor, a department 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Police examined the debris to determine if it actually was a bomb, but were 
not available Sunday night to say what they had found. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume that if it was a bomb, it could have damaged passing traffic, and 
the highway itself," said Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 A Caltrans worker spotted the suspicious-looking pipe about 8:45 a.m. and 
notified the CHP, which called in the LAPD, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers from the LAPD's Van Nuys Division and the bomb squad arrived 
about 9:40, and the CHP closed the north and southbound lanes from 10 to 11:10 
a.m. while the bomb was examined and destroyed where it was found, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers closed the ramps connecting the Ventura and San Diego freeways, 
causing long traffic jams on the freeways and nearby surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearby section of Burbank Boulevard was also closed off during that time, 
Taylor said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANCASTER IN VANGUARD OF DRIVE TO RECYCLE 
TIRES; ENVIRONMENT: THE CITY USES THE WASTE TO MAKE A BASEBALL FIELD AND 
COMPOST BINS. 'TIRE DUST' WILL SOON BE TRIED AS AN ASPHALT ROAD SEALANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three innovative tire recycling programs have made Lancaster a leader in the 
state's quest to keep tires out of landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster has shredded 10,000 tires into crumbs, mixed them with compost and 
built a baseball field. The city also is using thousands of recycled tires to 
make compost bins. Soon it will start using "tire dust" as an asphalt road 
sealant. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs are the result of $196,000 in grants that Lancaster received last 
year from the California Integrated Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "In California, tires are not a real significant percentage of the trash, but 
they are a real problem," said Jesse R. Huff, chairman of the state board, 
citing a state law that took effect more than a year ago that prohibits whole 
tires from being buried in landfills. Cut tires are still permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Huff said 28 million waste tires are generated in California each year. "We've 
found something to do with 11 million of them, (but) 17 million every year we 
don't have a use for." 
</P>
<P>
 Huff said it is hoped that programs such as those in Lancaster will lead to a 
viable way to keep tires out of landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the ball field made of tire crumbs, officials said the compost bins made 
of steel-belted radial tires are the first to be produced in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lancaster-based firm, K&E Engineering, developed the necessary equipment, 
including a die to punch out dog-bone-shaped tire scraps, and members of a 
local nonprofit organization have begun assembling compost bins. 
</P>
<P>
 Each bin -- 3 feet tall, 3 feet in diameter and held together with plastic 
tubing -- is built from 364 of the dog-boned tire scraps and 700 small discs 
cut from four tires. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the 95-pound bins contain nearly 93% recycled materials. The grant 
from the state provides enough funds for the assembly of 1,800 bins, each of 
which can hold a cubic yard of compost. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Olson, Lancaster's recycling coordinator, said once the bins are 
distributed to community groups and sold to residents they will do more than 
just keep waste tires out of the local landfill. Bin users will also be 
recycling green waste, such as yard clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 K&E Engineering is also searching for uses for the 30% of each tire that is 
not usable in the making of the compost bins. Company President Ed Read said 
possible uses for the scraps include erosion control material and tree 
supports. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tire-crumb softball field, officials said they are getting good 
results. Grass on the field is growing better than on an adjacent field that 
was not amended with tire crumbs, said Kent Kurtz, a Cal Poly Pomona 
horticulture/plant and soil science professor who has been monitoring the 
fields since they were tilled three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Water is being absorbed into the tire crumb field better than on the other 
field, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on, I wasn't sure what the results would be," said Kurtz. "I'm very 
encouraged by what I see." 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer sports injuries are anticipated on the tire crumb field, although Kurtz 
said it is too early to tell if the field's resiliency will prove to be as high 
as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Test patches of the asphalt sealant made from tires may be applied in the next 
60 days.

HEAVY RAIN DUE; SLIDE FEARS RAISED; WEATHER: FLASH-FLOOD WARNINGS ARE ISSUED 
FOR LAGUNA BEACH AND OTHER SOUTHLAND AREAS THAT WERE HIT BY THE FALL WILDFIRES. 
EMERGENCY CREWS ON ALERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The season's worst winter storm was expected to arrive this morning in the 
unnerving form of an inch or more of rain in areas of Orange County that can 
least afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash-flood warnings were issued Sunday for all parts of Southern California 
that were hard hit by last fall's wildfires -- Laguna Beach included -- where 
heavy rain could produce mudslides. "If we get an inch or more in these areas, 
it leads to the possibility of mudslides, flash-flooding and the debris flow of 
ash that was left behind by the fires," said Dean Jones, a meteorologist at 
WeatherData in Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that this storm will be the worst so far this season, perhaps 
lasting until mid-afternoon Tuesday, triggered new fears that mudslides may 
further damage Laguna Beach, a city still struggling to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at radar pictures and it's looking fairly dense," said Patrick 
Brennan, a Laguna Beach firefighter who was manning the city's emergency 
command post Sunday night. "This is the storm that we're most concerned with." 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan was tracking the amount of rain that began arriving in Southern 
California late Sunday and figured that if it reached more than half an inch in 
one hour in an area, then Laguna Beach would embark on an all-out effort to 
move backhoes, graders, bulldozers and sandbags into place and residents out of 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the areas hardest hit by the fire -- in Canyon Acres, along Park 
Avenue and in other nearby flood-plain areas -- would be advised to move via 
the Police Department's public address system. If necessary, Laguna Beach High 
School will serve as an emergency shelter for the American Red Cross, Brennan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fall fires that burned hundreds of homes and left scores homeless, 
five winter storms have moved through Laguna. The worst storm up to now 
occurred shortly after the fires, causing rivers of mud that damaged homes and 
forced evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
 But by all indications, this storm has the potential to be much worse, 
according to meteorologists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department has teams on call to patrol the shores and 
inspect rivers and creeks that may swell, and has bulldozers, sandbags and 
crews at the ready, said Michele Palmer, communications supervisor for the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully nothing will happen, but if it does, we'll be ready," Palmer said. 
"The first sign that we've got problems is if Laguna Canyon Road has to be 
closed. All we can do is hope, hope, hope that it doesn't get bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The storm began developing late Sunday some 500 miles from the coast, but had 
already dropped two inches of rain over San Francisco. The storm was moving 
south along the coastline. The rain was expected to be at its heaviest by this 
morning, leading to possible thunderstorms by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures were expected to drop markedly, with highs in the upper 50s and 
lower 60s today and lows in the upper 30s and lower 40s by Tuesday. The only 
good news is that after Tuesday, there's not another storm in sight, said Jones 
of WeatherData, which supplies forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain of last week was a light sprinkling compared to what is expected 
today and Tuesday, he said, and any areas that had started to slide would only 
be worsened by this latest winter storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a messy situation if we get all the rain that we expect," he said. 
"This is a lot stronger storm." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Laguna Beach, the National Weather Service issued flash-flood warnings 
for fire-ravaged hillsides throughout Southern California, including Topanga, 
Malibu and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of the storm, Los Angeles County firefighters have put more 
crews on duty and readied two sand-filled dump trucks for emergency sandbagging 
in mudslide-prone areas. The department's swift-water rescue team has been 
placed on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims in makeshift homes and tents are being urged to seek cover at 
Red Cross permanent shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 American Red Cross officials reported Sunday that they had closed the last two 
of what had been more than a dozen formal tent shelters after persuading the 
residents to move indoors. Red Cross spokeswoman Peggy Hinz said a handful of 
residents remaining at the large tent at Church on the Way in Van Nuys moved to 
indoor shelters, and about 100 from the Le Conte Junior High School shelter in 
Hollywood were taken by van to two indoor shelters.

300 ACTIVISTS TAKE PENS IN HAND TO AID ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Animal rights crusader Ava Park recites the parable with the zeal of a 
missionary. 
</P>
<P>
 After supporters sent a few hundred letters in support of a Latin American 
political prisoner some years ago, the guards gave the man back his clothes. 
After the next few hundred letters, the prison warden came to see him. After 
3,000 or so, he was finally set free. 
</P>
<P>
 The story seemed worth retelling Sunday as more than 300 animal rights 
activists turned out at a write-in organized by Park's Orange County People for 
Animals to send some 9,000 letters around the country in opposition to what 
they regard as inhumane practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "One letter doesn't seem like a big thing," said Park, 38, "but if legislators 
and company presidents continue to be inundated, it slowly starts to alter the 
consciousness. . . . You start to force people to rethink their positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton will get some stacks of letters from Orange County. So will 
members of Congress and federal wildlife officials and corporate presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the owner of the posh Antonello Ristorante in Santa Ana can expect a 
mailbox filled with letters in the next few days. OCPA members want the eatery 
to stop serving veal. Owner Antonio Cagnolo could not be reached Sunday for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants at Sunday's write-in at the Hyatt Regency Irvine added a few 
messages of their own. But for the most part, they simply scrawled their names 
at the bottom of 30 detailed and often angry letters on animal rights, prepared 
by OCPA leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of the things going on in animal rights are outrageous," said 
Vanessa Sprungl, 39, a financial analyst from Laguna Beach who attended the 
write-in with her husband. "And if these people get enough mail, maybe they'll 
know how we feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the targets of the letter writers are medical researchers and drug 
companies that experiment with live animals, a dog sled race in Alaska that 
OCPA members say has been "tainted with inhumane and brutal treatment" of 
animals, stores that sell furs and conservancies that use wire neck snares to 
trap game. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters address a wide range of other animal rights issues as well, but 
some areas -- such as factory farming practices -- were intentionally avoided 
because the group does not believe it has any immediate chance of lobbying 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The farm lobby is so tremendously powerful that we can only make progress in 
very small amounts," Park conceded. "We can't eliminate red-meat eating 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 With 2,000 members, OCPA is the county's biggest animal rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Park founded the group in 1988, it has established a niche as an often 
combative protector of animal rights, staging vigils and protests around Orange 
County. After disrupting two events at the Orange County Fair in 1992, the 
group won an agreement with the fair that allowed it to set up a table outside 
the rodeo event and offer uncensored literature on animal cruelty. In exchange, 
the group agreed not to demonstrate again outside the rodeo, and one public 
relations official with the fair even attended Sunday's event. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics accuse the animal rights group of overly aggressive tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Phalen, a UC Irvine professor who sits on the school's Animal 
Research Ethics Committee and acts as a spokesman on the issue, said Sunday 
that Park is "an extremely skilled manipulator . . . (who) misinforms other 
people and stirs them to action." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among its mass mailings, OCPA is sending one to new UCI Chancellor Laurel 
Wilkening, asking her to review the university's policies on animal testing and 
requesting that a medical researcher debate the group on the volatile issue. 
OCPA has held several protests on campus over the years, accusing researchers 
of inhumane practices involving cats, monkeys and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Park said it was this type of research that first sparked her interest in 
animal rights. She recalled going out on a date with a medical student who, 
while on the way to a movie, needed to stop by the laboratory to check on an 
experiment involving research on cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so casual about the whole thing, and I was horrified," she said. "We 
didn't even end up going to the movie. I realized we had nothing to talk about 
after that." 
</P>
<P>
 But UCI's Phalen said critics fail to appreciate the stringent safeguards for 
establishing the essential need for any research, and for avoiding pain to any 
animals. As for the OCPA request for a public debate, Phalen said the issue has 
already been debated extensively and that Park appears to lack the scientific 
knowledge to add much to the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Park was unimpressed by Park's broadside. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a real fan of ours," she said of Phalen. "Of course he'd say that, 
because if we had our way, he'd be out of business. He wouldn't have a job."

RAIL PROPOSALS SIGNAL O.C.'S COMING OF AGE; MASS TRANSIT: 'WE'RE NO LONGER THE 
SUBURBS,' SAYS ONE OFFICIAL. BY APRIL, PLANNERS HOPE TO HAVE ROUTE SELECTED 
THROUGH CONGESTED CORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Breezing into your office after a hop on a monorail or similar vehicle is 
still a dream for Orange County's stressed-out commuters. But prospects are 
looking up, say county transit officials. 
</P>
<P>
 By April, transit planners hope to have a route selected through the county's 
heavily congested central core. At the same time, the Orange County 
Transportation Authority Board will be asked to push for an undetermined amount 
of federal funds for the rail project. That will trigger a $1 million-to-$2 
million analysis of all transit options along the same corridor, which would be 
used to justify federal funding of the rail project. 
</P>
<P>
 This will not be the final decision to build. In fact, officials have not even 
decided yet whether the rail line should be elevated or built at street level, 
like the Metro Rail Blue Line from Long Beach to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The public, including groups critical of rail transit as a costly boondoggle, 
will weigh in at a public hearing in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the decision pending in April symbolizes Orange County's coming of age, 
its transformation from a bedroom community to an urban area distinct from Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're no longer the suburbs," says Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who 
predicts that he and his colleagues on the OCTA board will vote to beat a path 
to Washington's pot of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is a driving force. Federal transit funding is done in seven-year cycles 
and the next one starts in 1996 -- shortly after OCTA completes the mandatory 
analysis, which will consider a variety of modes of transit for the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Measure M, the half-cent sales tax increase approved by county 
voters in 1990, promised an intra-county, multi-stop urban rail system, not 
just more of Metrolink commuter trains that run between counties with few 
stations in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure M earmarked $340 million for urban rail -- enough to build maybe six 
miles. But transit planners and politicians are eyeing a 15- to 30-mile starter 
line that would require a big chunk of state and federal funds as well as 
investment in station sites by private developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a defining moment," said OCTA Chief Executive Officer Stan Oftelie. 
"We're dealing with a classic paradigm shift. . . . When we previously looked 
at light rail (in 1984), we asked if it could work in a suburban county. Now 
we're asking, can it work in an urban county? It's a gamble, but one that was 
approved by the voters in Measure M. It was Measure M that shifted the burden 
of proof. Now it's 'Why shouldn't we do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the tremendous lead time needed for such projects, decisions made 
now will not be running until 2002. Failure to move forward, said Monte Ward, a 
key OCTA strategist, could force officials to seek amendments to Measure M in 
order to allow use of the $340 million for other transportation purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the recent Northridge earthquake is giving the project new impetus. 
</P>
<P>
 County elected officials are talking about how the Northridge temblor proved 
the value of having multiple transportation options, including rail service, to 
supplement the highway system.  
</P>
<P>
 The buzzword in Washington is "multi-modalism," which means those in charge of 
doling out federal tax money are looking for projects that reduce the public's 
dependence on any single form of transportation. In Orange County, that means 
getting people off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Two studies show that the South Coast Plaza-Disneyland corridor is well suited 
for urban rail. So far, said OCTA planner David Elbaum, "there are no fatal 
flaws" to putting trains there. 
</P>
<P>
 But OCTA board members are fiscally cautious and openly skeptical about the 
timing for urban rail; their constituents focus on today's budget and traffic 
hassles -- not on projections for what the county may be like in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have government agencies that by their very nature are conservative," 
Santa Ana's Young told a convention of transportation planners in Anaheim last 
week. "They're not used to taking risks. Business takes risk." 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Councilman William D. Mahoney is the OCTA board member most 
skeptical. He's suggested that the bus system must first expand and "max out," 
which would save money in the short run and lay a more solid foundation for the 
high ridership levels needed on urban rail to justify the enormous construction 
cost -- anywhere from $30 million to $70 million per mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pre-Measure M, we saw a strong shift toward rail in the public opinion 
polling we've done," said OCTA's Ward. "But when you talk specifically about 
rail, like where you're going to put it and who is going to use it, the public 
gets much more critical of it. The question is 'Who is the system going to 
serve?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ward says there is constant debate about whether one system caters more to the 
well-to-do rather than the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA's chief rail planner Nancy Michali, who previously worked on rail 
projects in Los Angeles County, says there are lots of ways to define success 
and measure ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you measure success by how many riders you have during the morning and 
evening peak congestion periods? The Blue Line has had success partly because 
people use it in the middle of the day for shorter, local trips -- like 
students and people doing their shopping. It's not just people commuting from 
homes in Long Beach to jobs in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, changes in the economy mean there are fewer people working 
traditional 9 to 5 jobs. "Work has spread out to other times of the day or 
week," Michali said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other changes to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, OCTA's chairman, has had OCTA look 
at the county's evolving demographics to make sure any urban rail line reflects 
future settlement patterns and cultural diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's built-in tension between those who want urban rail to help people 
get to and from work and others who see it as a tool for city redevelopment 
projects. There's a constant refrain: "Will it be good for business?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tran Vinh, who owns a liquor store on Bristol Street in Santa Ana, believes an 
elevated rail line there would "improve the neighborhood" and bring in a 
"higher class clientele." But he worries that new competition from development 
around station sites would drive him out. "Who knows?" he asked, laughing. 
"Maybe I will have enough money by then to buy the entire block." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there's no shortage of companies lining up for a chance to supply 
vehicles and lay the track. They range from Canada's Bombardier Corp., which 
built the monorail at Walt Disney World in Florida, to local entrepreneurs who 
have designs for pneumatic tubes with slits for windblown sails attached to a 
train's underside. 
</P>
<P>
 But any OCTA decision to move forward will be met by an almost unanimous 
chorus of criticism from academia, where anti-rail sentiment has peaked in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent UCLA study, for example, cast doubt on the net transportation benefit 
from rail because of the congestion created from new development around 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 And some, including UCI Prof. Charles A. Lave, argue that rail is extremely 
inefficient. "Can you imagine what could be achieved if they put the same money 
into a decent bus system?" Lave wrote recently. But Lave is no fan of buses 
either, suggesting that automobiles are simply an "irresistible force." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, OCTA officials hope to build both an extensive bus system and add 
urban rail in stages. There are fears, however, that the bus system will cater 
only to the poor and the rail line will be priced for the well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials say the bus system will be expanded first. Urban rail will not 
be completed for a long time, allowing the bus system to grow and improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with bus riders suggest there is room for that. Riders say trains 
are nicer, cleaner, safer, quieter and less jerky than buses. Trains get stuck 
due to accidents on the tracks, several passengers told The Times, but it is 
worse on buses because they get mired in the same traffic jams as cars every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many surveys also show that the public is not too keen on buses because they 
associate them with low economic status and crime risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Manny Lujan last week was on the No. 43 bus north to Fullerton from his 
mechanic's job at a Costa Mesa car dealership, a route that parallels the 
proposed rail corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes there is no room on the bus and I have to wait for the next one, or 
the third one," he said. "I don't like it because it's too crowded, and you get 
bounced around quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 But will Lujan and other car-less, transit-dependent city folk be able to 
afford to ride urban rail or will it be used by yuppies in suits and ties who 
can afford what are likely to be stiff ticket prices?  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, politics will govern this debate about pricing and subsidies.  
</P>
<P>
 "So what if it's the folks in suits and ties," said Santa Ana's Young, when 
commenting on the ridership on existing commuter trains. "Isn't it amazing that 
you can get those people to leave cars?" New Rail Route? 
</P>
<P>
 County transportation planners will soon decide whether to go ahead with plans 
for an intra-county, urban rail line. So far, experts favor a South Coast Plaza 
to Disneyland path roughly along Main or Bristol streets in Santa Ana.

PERIL CAN BE INSPIRING; MT. BALDY ORDEAL GIVES RESCUED WOMAN A GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cynthia Moyneur knows what it's like to be rescued. Now she'd like to return 
the favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Moyneur, 38, of Anaheim is expected to graduate today from the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Academy as a reserve deputy sheriff -- the first phase of a 
long training program for people who want to qualify as members of 
search-and-rescue teams, the very kind of people who saved Moyneur's life in 
1991 after she became stranded on Mt. Baldy. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what inspired her to become one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these people were volunteers -- they gave their time and risked their 
lives to save lives," she said. "What a wonderful thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And, she added, "I wanted to repay the debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Moyneur and then-11-year-old Ryan McIntosh, her boyfriend's nephew, had to be 
rescued in December, 1991, after they got trapped in a sudden snowstorm on Mt. 
Baldy. They spent two days in subzero weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer rescue teams from Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties 
went into action. The 60-odd searchers persisted through the weekend, and when 
the Sierra Madre Rescue Team found the two survivors, the rescue made news 
throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to find them "inspired (Moyneur) so much that she wanted to be a 
part of them," said her father, Raymond, noting that his daughter is a runner, 
cyclist and hiker. "She's always been outdoorsy anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Moyneur, like young Ryan, suffered severe frostbite and hypothermia. 
She lost the tip of her big toe to frostbite and spent six months recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 Moyneur went back to her job as a physical therapist at the Sequoia Athletic 
Club in Buena Park. There she met one of her rescuers by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Buhite, a member of the San Dimas Rescue Team, which had participated in 
the search, came in with a muscle injury. When Moyneur asked him how he 
received the injury, he said it was from rescue training with the Sheriff's 
Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't know it was me," Moyneur recalled. "I asked him, 'You wouldn't 
happen to remember when a woman and child got lost on Mt. Baldy?' and he said, 
'I sure do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Buhite recalled: "She held out her hand and said, 'I want to thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moyneur said that coincidence was a turning point for her. She asked Buhite 
about the program and its requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last November, after she had recovered from toe surgery and felt ready 
to train, she applied to and entered the Sheriff's Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most would-be volunteer rescuers are required to train as reserve sheriff's 
deputies, going on patrol shifts once every four to six weeks, said Moyneur. 
Three of her graduating class of 52 trained specifically to go on as members of 
search-and-rescue teams, and will patrol mountain trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Moyneur, a fit, slender athlete, is one of a few women now in training with 
the San Dimas Rescue Team. She had trained more than 20 hours a week in Saugus 
and Whittier for the 13 weeks at the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue program requires toughness and agility, and not everyone who wants 
to be a volunteer rescuer can handle the rigors, Moyneur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Moyneur has to take especial caution when dealing with freezing 
temperatures, because "once you've had frostbite, you're more susceptible to it 
thereafter," she said. "I just need to watch the temperatures." 
</P>
<P>
 She was relieved to find that losing the tip of her left toe didn't affect her 
ability to climb walls, run obstacle courses and drag dummies in training. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-odd San Dimas team members will complete another year of training -- 
learning to rappel off walls and out of helicopters, tying knots, and learning 
outdoor survival and emergency techniques. They will train about three days a 
week. Then, after a six-month probationary period, Moyneur will finally receive 
a beeper used to page volunteer rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moyneur said she intends to follow in the footsteps of the rescuers who saved 
her and Ryan. "I want to be there," she said. "I want to feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling at the irony, she added: "I'll be on Mt. Baldy again."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; RESIDENTS TO OUTLINE OPPOSITION TO PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents seeking to block the development of the Palace Park amusement 
complex on Harvard Avenue on Tuesday will again take their case to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes as opponents continue to raise money and seek community support 
for their fight against the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Christina L. Shea said she placed the item on Tuesday's agenda 
"to help create a forum for constructive discussions between the residents" and 
the San Francisco-based developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the proposed Palace Park site is zoned for entertainment, the project 
does not require approval from the Planning Commission or City Council as long 
as it meets general city guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents are demanding that the city conduct a full review of the 
project anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 They fear the park will attract troublesome youths to the area and increase 
crime, traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer insists that the plan, which calls for miniature golf courses, 
bumper boat rides and an arcade on vacant land just west of the San Diego 
Freeway, will not seriously affect the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials who visited other Palace Park facilities say they are run 
with security in mind. The Police Department is also working with park 
operators to develop a security plan for the Irvine site. 
</P>
<P>
 But concerns about Palace Park persist. Opponents, most of whom live in the 
University Park and Westpark villages, have raised more than $1,000 so far and 
have hired an attorney to help them fight the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to look at some of the negative impacts that the residents are 
concerned with," Shea said. "We have to give due process to the residents." 
</P>
<P>
 After discussing the issue last week, the Planning Commission adopted a 
resolution calling for changes in the zoning laws that would force future 
amusement park developments to get commission and City Council approval. SHELBY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; 5 STORES DESTROYED IN STRIP MALL FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-alarm fire raced through a strip mall Saturday night, gutting five 
stores and causing about $1 million in damage, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials are still investigating the cause of the 11:40 p.m. 
blaze at the shopping center in the 1600 block of West Orangethorpe Avenue. No 
one was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty firefighters from Fullerton, Anaheim and Orange worked for more than an 
hour to control the blaze, which destroyed two restaurants, a boot store, a 
jewelry boutique and a beauty supply shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other stores and a supermarket in the strip mall were spared, fire 
officials said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DONORS TO HOMELESS BLANKETING COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month, Raymond C. Fico asked the public to help with his campaign to 
distribute blankets and clothes to the homeless. This month, the humanitarian 
known as Blanket Man got his answer -- everything's covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten probably 50 calls this morning, the phone's been ringing off the 
hook this afternoon," the 74-year-old Fico said last week. "It's just what we 
needed: a shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Fico said an article about his organization in The Times on Jan. 31 spurred a 
flurry of donations, volunteers and well-wishers, all of which will help his 
nonprofit Covering Wings Inc. step up its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday afternoon, a steady stream of letters with donations enclosed had 
piled up on Fico's desk, and well-wishers were visiting his Huntington Beach 
appliance store with kind words and financial help. In addition, an area school 
is considering embracing Fico's charity as a fund-raising project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notes that come through with the donations are just wonderful, too, just 
to hear how much people care and want to share," Fico said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired Anaheim Hills minister's efforts to keep Orange County's homeless 
warm and dry had taken a back seat to his earthquake relief efforts in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he and a squad of volunteers handed out 14,000 of his shiny, silver 
survival blankets in areas where the temblors left residents living in tent 
cities or without shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 But that charity work had stripped his supplies of blankets, which he had 
planned to use to help the homeless in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush of support will allow Fico to step up his Orange County work. Since 
he was touched and inspired in 1985 by a Christmastime news report featuring 
huddled, shivering homeless people, Fico has handed out more than half a 
million cloth and survival blankets and thousands of garments. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about Covering Wings or to volunteer money, clothes or 
time, call Fico at (714) 968-3358. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SCHOLARSHIPS AID LA COLONIA YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manuel Ontiveros' dream of becoming a lawyer or policeman got a boost recently 
when he became one of three students to receive a $1,000 scholarship in 
recognition of his volunteer work at an Anaheim community center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes in pretty handy when you're paying for school," said Ontiveros, a 
Fullerton College sophomore who hopes to study criminology at UC Irvine next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros and two other Anaheim youths, Francis Amaya, 22, and Sophia Andrea 
Garcia, 17, received checks Jan. 17 from the Dr. Cynthia Coad Scholarship Fund 
for their work at the Anaheim Independencia Community Center on Garza Avenue. 
The center provides recreation and education programs for residents in the 
low-income La Colonia neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main purpose of the scholarship is to reward volunteerism," said Cynthia 
Coad, who donated stocks to fund the scholarship and serves as chairwoman of 
the center's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "One good way to counteract gangs is to encourage education so someone will 
have a career," Coad said. This is the third time she has awarded the 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros was recognized for his two years of volunteer work as a fund-raiser 
and office clerk at the Independencia center, Coad said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Amaya, also a Fullerton College sophomore, was recognized for helping 
young people in the center's summer program. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the summer, he really worked extra time with the recreation program 
for the youth," Coad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really good with the young kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaya is a math major and hopes to become a math teacher, Coad said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophia Andrea Garcia, a junior at Magnolia High School in Anaheim, also helped 
with the recreation program last summer and hopes to become a lawyer, Coad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coad has lived near the La Colonia neighborhood for more than 23 years and 
said the Latino culture of the area has enriched her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from the Midwest, and so I was not really acquainted with Latino culture 
until I came here" 35 years ago, Coad said, adding that she found that the 
values of the Latino families in her neighborhood served as an example for her 
as she raised her own seven children. "It's our way of saying thanks," she 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; CONDO DENIAL WAS IMPROPER, JUDGE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ruled that the city improperly denied Iraj 
Mahdavi's plan to convert a 22-unit apartment complex into condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, which city officials say they won't appeal, means the city must 
grant permits allowing Mahdavi to sell the units to individual owners. 
</P>
<P>
 According to City Atty. Carol B. Tanenbaum, Judge James L. Smith last week 
said there was no basis for the city's findings that displaced tenants would 
suffer financially and that potential buyers would not be able to afford the 
condos. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's ruling came after Mahdavi had battled with the city for nearly 15 
months to win project approval. What stated as a promising application approved 
by the Planning Commission in November, 1992, quickly soured when the City 
Council denied the application the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahdavi changed the plan to address the council's complaints about parking and 
appealed the decision last February. Once again, the Planning Commission 
recommended approval and the council denied the application. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahdavi then got a court order from Smith ordering the city to reconsider its 
decision, but in October the council again denied the request, this time saying 
the market for condos had dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the council members also questioned Mahdavi's claim that several of 
his current tenants are interested in buying their units. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't heard one word on how they will qualify" for mortgage loans, said 
Norman Z. Eckenrode. "I don't feel all of them will qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahdavi plans to sell the two- and three-bedroom units at the Gables for 
$120,000 to $135,000. He has offered purchase assistance to those tenants who 
want to buy and relocation assistance to tenants who leave. DANIELLE A.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER RAISING SERVICE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider taking the first step toward raising 
some fees for police and fire service. At issue is whether to hold a public 
hearing to talk about the fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The council this year will consider raising public safety, community services, 
administration and development services fees. The fees, proposed for the 
1994-95 fiscal year, would not increase above the costs to the city of 
providing service. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed public safety fees include raising both a taxi driver or 
solicitor's permit from $15 to $60, raising a police false-alarm response for 
residents from $25 to $145, and raising a fire false-alarm for residents from 
$25 to $125. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also consider whether to award $44,444 to a Huntington Beach 
roofing company to repair a portion of the roof at the Rea Community Center, 
661 Hamilton St. The Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse, the March of Dimes and the 
Boys & Girls Club use the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also weigh whether to pay for the repair of the roof at the 
Girls Inc. building at 1815 Anaheim Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The council awarded $9,600 two years ago to the organization to purchase gym 
equipment for a planned expansion. But the expansion fell through, and now 
Girls Inc. will ask to use the same money for roof repairs. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI NAMES ACTING MEDICAL COLLEGE DEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Thomas Cesario, chairman of UCI Medical Center's Department of Medicine 
since 1990, has been appointed acting dean of the College of Medicine by UCI 
Chancellor Laurel Wilkening. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment is effective March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try very hard to help the school continue to grow and increase 
in prestige as it has," Cesario said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesario, 53, has taught at the school for 22 years and will act as dean while 
a committee searches for a permanent dean. The process could take as long as 15 
months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the meantime, my job is to do whatever I can to see the school stays on 
course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesario replaces his former mentor, Walter Henry, who resigned Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In searching for a new dean, the school will look for someone with 
administrative expertise and strong fund-raising skills, Cesario said. 
</P>
<P>
 The person chosen will probably have to revise the curriculum to "tailor it to 
the needs of the modern medical student" in light of the Clinton 
Administration's proposed health care reforms, Cesario said. 
</P>
<P>
 That means training more generalists and fewer specialists and making sure 
that procedures are cost-effective, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesario is co-director of the college's Program in Geriatric Medicine. He 
teaches courses in microbiology and infectious diseases and is an expert in 
geriatric medicine, AIDS and other infectious diseases.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; NEW PARK STRUCTURE INSTANT HIT WITH KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five-year-old Erica Garcia has a new $38,000 toy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the state-of-the-art playground structure at Marina Community Park, which 
appears as a miniature post-modern tower with its assorted slides, ladders, 
wheels and other attractions meant to keep youngster amused and active. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much to do. She could stay all day," said Erica's mother, Maria 
Garcia of Long Beach. "She loves it here." 
</P>
<P>
 And Erica is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach parks officials said that use of the park has increased 
significantly since the new playground structure was put in late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The colorful wood, plastic and metal structure replaced a gray jungle gym that 
was obsolete and did not meet current safety standards, said Andy Seymour, 
director of parks and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of residents worked for months helping design the playground 
structure. Their goal was to create a "multi-sensory" facility that would 
provide fun for kids young and old, shy and outgoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a structure with 12 "attractions" ranging from a cargo net that 
children can play on to a "clatter bridge" that makes a noise when it is walked 
across. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure -- made mostly from wood to blend into the park surroundings -- 
contains two towers as well as a plastic bubble that kids can look through. It 
is divided in such a way that kids can play in one area and then move on to 
another portion of the playground and use a completely different set of 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground area is accessible for disabled people and includes a swing 
set. The $38,000 came from city funds and donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my place," Erica said as she clutched the curving slide at the park. 
"Tell Mommy I don't want to go home." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; BRAZILIANS KICK OFF MARDI GRAS FESTIVITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Costumed revelers wiggled, shook and laughed to a live samba beat as the 
county's small Brazilian community celebrated its fourth annual carnival party. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-Lenten festival, better known as Mardi Gras in the United States, will 
be celebrated in Brazil with four days of nonstop dancing and enormous samba 
parades starting next weekend, but local Brazilians decided to get a head start 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wait the whole year for this day. It's the only day that we can remember 
Brazil and celebrate like Brazilians," said Lina Rasul of Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasul helped found the Brazilian Club of California three years ago to 
organize family-oriented events for the county's far-flung Brazilian community. 
</P>
<P>
 She and the other approximately 150 Brazilians who showed up for Saturday's 
party in Orange said they miss their homeland and look forward to carnival as a 
chance to " matar a saudade ," or kill homesickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "In American places there isn't this Brazilian happiness," said Jorge Machado, 
30, of Tustin, who moved here two years ago from his native Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carnival for me is a day of great happiness," said Cristina Hofmeister of 
Irvine, beaming, her cheeks adorned with red metallic hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dressed up for carnival ever since I was a little girl," the 41-year-old 
Brazilian native said. "I always come up with something." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way to get your stress out," said Lucia Cardwell, 40, of Corona. 
"Brazil is such a mess, yet the people are happy. It's five to six days of 
party, party, party." 
</P>
<P>
 While some shimmied to the deafening beat of the samba drums, horns and 
tambourines, others munched on kibes, Arabic meat patties popular in Brazil, 
and guzzled bottles of cold "Antarctica," a favorite national brew. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some of the more glitzy carnival parties offered by Los Angeles clubs, 
the Orange County carnival had the feel of a small-town family party. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were always clubs in Los Angeles, but that was only for young people," 
said Cale Coelho, 25, of Fullerton. "When we came up with the idea to start 
this club, it was more family oriented," he said, adding that parents wanted to 
be able to share Brazilian culture with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Orange County, Coelho identifies strongly with the native 
country of his parents. He sported a yellow and green T-shirt of the Brazilian 
national soccer team, and is eagerly awaiting the first Brazilian game of the 
World Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Robson Santos, 29, another soccer fan, said he drove 40 miles from Chino Hills 
to attend the party. He brings his children to club events because he worries 
they will forget their Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bring them here so that they can learn the language," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few Americans attended the party, too. "Everybody just does their thing and 
you just have fun," said Bobby Wilson, 50, a bailiff at the Superior Court in 
Santa Ana. Wilson comes with his Brazilian wife, who looks forward to the party 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 And some were entirely new to carnival. "It's my first Brazilian experience," 
said Andrew Thompson, 23, an Orange Coast College student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's awesome. I'm going to Brazil next year," he said. MARY LOU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; CITY DENIES MANSION DEVELOPER EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A developer who has exclusive rights to renovate the historic Casa Romantica 
mansion has failed to win an extension of a city deadline for submitting a 
proposal for the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council decided last week to call for bids from other developers 
unless Maureen Capiello Gates, who currently leases Casa Romantica, acts before 
Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the council granted Gates exclusive rights to submit a proposal 
for renovating the historic mansion and gave her 120 days to turn in a specific 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've gone the extra mile to give (Gates) the first shot" at 
developing Casa Romantica, Mayor Scott Diehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city purchased the mansion, built on a scenic bluff overlooking the ocean 
by city founder Ole Hanson, for $2.5 million in 1989. Gates has been working 
with the San Clemente Historical Society to purchase Casa Romantica and turn it 
into a vacation resort, featuring about 80 time-share units and a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative for Gates said that the developer has run into problems 
trying to market the complex to prospective investors. Time-share groups want 
to know the selling price of the site, which the city hasn't yet negotiated 
with Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates was also asking for extra time because a major hotel chain has recently 
shown interest in the property, said Harry Root, executive director of the Casa 
Romantica Historic Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning officials said there are ways of compensating for land costs and 
suggested that Gates turn in as complete a proposal as possible by Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 If she misses the deadline, Gates can still submit plans during the next 
four-month period when proposals would be accepted from other developers, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that precludes (Gates') proposal to come back in and compete 
with the other" developers' proposals, Diehl said. FRANK MESSINA

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

for two management positions in the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 For assistant fire chief, the council approved a salary of $6,477 to $7,825 
per month.For division chief of administration and fire prevention, the salary 
range is from $6,214 to $7,249 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 The two new positions were created as part of the reorganization of the Fire 
Department, which the council approved last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistant fire chief will handle general operations, attend to personnel 
matters including discipline, and serve as acting fire chief in the absence of 
the fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The administration and fire prevention division chief will coordinate the 
department's training, paramedic services and administration of clerical 
employees. In addition, he or she will be in charge of fire prevention programs 
and fire investigations.

WITNESS TO ANAHEIM MAN'S SLAYING THREATENED, SHE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim man was shot to death Sunday and his girlfriend, who witnessed the 
slaying, told police the gunman threatened to come back and kill her and her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Police released scant information about the 4:30 a.m. shooting at the 
girlfriend's apartment in the 2500 block of East Park Lane.They identified the 
victim as Paul Rivas, 31, and said the suspected gunman remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Sunday, Rivas' girlfriend, Becky Cruz, 30, said she knew the 
assailant. "He told me he was going to come back and kill me and the kids and 
himself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz said the assailant apparently came into her apartment Sunday by climbing 
through her front window. Rivas, who was awake and was in the living room at 
the time, confronted the man with a baseball bat, Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she ran into the living room, Cruz said, the assailant had Rivas in a 
headlock with a gun pointed at his temple. "He said, 'This is for you' (to 
Rivas) and shot him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman then left the house, and as Cruz tried to revive Rivas, he 
returned, shoved her away, grabbed Rivas' hair and said, "This is for you, 
Becky," and shot Rivas in the head once more, Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant then turned the gun toward her, Cruz said. "I was on my knees 
and I (begged) him, 'Please, please, don't kill me,' " she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 She lunged for the gun and during the ensuing struggle, the gunman apparently 
lost his balance, Cruz said. She ran from the apartment and the assailant fired 
after her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guessed he tried to shoot me but got some cars instead," Cruz said. She 
said she ran to her mother, who lives nearby in the same neighborhood.

 A 42-year-old man was arrested Saturday on suspicion of drunk driving and 
hit-and-run driving after a traffic accident that left his 13-year-old son and 
the driver of the other vehicle hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Terrence Molloy of Huntington Beach was turning left from Beach

store. 
</P>
<P>

Cope said. A short time later, police found and arrested him. 
</P>

WESTMINSTER PROPOSAL CALLS FOR 2 SCHOOLS TO CLOSE, 1 TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK, Special To The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 900 students would attend new schools this fall under a proposed 
Westminster School District plan to reopen one newly renovated campus while 
closing two aging ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Neomia B. Willmore Elementary will reopen in September, and Supt. Gail 
Wickstrom recommended on Thursday that the district close Virginia K. Boos and 
James W. Franklin Elementary Schools for financial and student enrollment 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very difficult decision to make. No one in the administration wants 
to close any school," she said at the board's regular meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would make the most efficient use of school space, she said, pointing 
out that ideally an elementary school should have between 500 and 650 students. 
Under the plan, most schools districtwide would maintain student populations 
within that range for several years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Ron Morgan emphasized that the proposed plan is not 
necessarily the one the district will adopt and that residents are encouraged 
to offer comments and suggestions during upcoming meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the proposal will be held on Feb. 17 at Stacey 
Intermediate School, 6311 Larchwood Dr, in Huntington Beach. The board is 
expected to make a decision on Mar. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 In her report to the board, Wickstrom said that in September Boos elementary 
will have too few students to justify keeping it open, especially since the 
aging school is costlier to maintain than other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, because many students would shift to Willmore, too few students will 
remain to justify keeping both Franklin and C. Fred Schroeder Elementary open. 
Wickstrom recommended that Franklin be closed, saying that the district should 
keep a campus south of Bolsa Avenue. Doing so would ensure that students who 
would otherwise have to cross Bolsa to get to school are not lost to other 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 When Willmore reopens, its students will include many of those who now attend 
Schroeder, Boos, Franklin, L. P. Webber, and Ada E. Clegg Elementary Schools. 
Of the students now attending Boos, most would go to Frank N. Eastwood 
Elementary School. Students currently attending Franklin would attend Schroeder 
and Clegg, said spokeswoman Audrey Brown.

ORANGE'S NEW CITY MANAGER IS SELECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David F. Dixon, the city manager of Temecula, has been selected as the new 
city manager for Orange. Dixon, 55, will succeed interim City Manager William 
F. Cornett on Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously approved Dixon's four-year contract last week. 
His annual salary will be $115,008. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they chose Dixon because of his extensive municipal 
experience, particularly his financial background. Like most cities in the 
county, Orange has been hit hard by the recession and forced to cope with 
dwindling revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the foremost city managers in California with outstanding skills 
in economic development and redevelopment," said Councilman Mike Spurgeon. "And 
obviously that's one of our top priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 people applied for the job, city officials said. Dixon was chosen 
from among seven finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 He previously served as city manager of Moreno Valley, Banning, Rancho Mirage 
and Sandy, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he will be a strong city manager," Councilwoman Joanne Coontz said. 
"The interest and concerns of the community and the Chamber of Commerce are 
well answered in our choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Local business and civic leaders had lobbied city officials to have input in 
choosing a new city manager, but the council eventually denied them direct 
involvement in the selection process.

 Mustafa Pajevic, a Bosnian soldier who was brought to the United States in an 
emergency humanitarian airlift last July to save his grenade-shattered left 
leg, is now stranded in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Pajevic is one of 19 disabled Bosnians who were flown from Bosnia to the 
United States in the first medical rescue mission out of that war-torn country. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this group, including 10 who were hospitalized in Southern California, 
recently learned that their expected repatriation will be indefinitely delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to speak in English and holding tourist visas that make it impossible 
for them to work or receive public assistance, they are completely dependent on 
the charity of volunteers, who are seeing their own finances stretched to the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Pajevic was released from Irvine Medical Center four months ago, he has 
lived with three families, moving whenever he felt the cost of his upkeep had 
become a burden on their generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the time I am on the move," said Pajevic, who now lives with two Bosnian 
American brothers in Laguna Niguel. "I don't know where I am going to end (up). 
. . . I may wind up on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The International Organization for Migration, the Swiss-based rescue group 
that arranged the airlift from Sarajevo, had intended that the Bosnian patients 
would return to their homeland shortly after they were released from the 
hospitals where they were treated. 
</P>
<P>
 But that plan was scuttled after the conflict in Bosnia intensified. The 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees informed IOM in December that 
international law forbids men of fighting age from being returned to a war zone 
such as Bosnia. So unless and until they can change their tourist status, the 
Bosnians will remain charity cases. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the responsibility for supporting the Bosnians treated in Southern 
California has fallen primarily on the local Muslim community, including a 
handful of Bosnian American families, many of whom say they are already 
hard-pressed trying to assist relatives displaced by the war -- both those in 
Bosnia and others who have emigrated here. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers buy groceries, pay other living expenses and drive the Bosnian 
visitors to doctors' appointments. These benefactors say IOM representatives 
assured them that their services would be required for no more than three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we are in the sixth month and there is no end in sight," said Ramza 
Saliefendic, a Los Angeles resident who is one of the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonja Hagel, the Century City Hospital administrator who was the driving force 
behind July's medical evacuation, says that her "sole responsibility" was to 
recruit hospitals and doctors for the project. That part of the operation went 
smoothly, the Huntington Beach resident said, noting that "every hospital has 
met its bargain or gone above and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 However, she added, "No one is more unhappy than I am right now to see these 
poor people sit here and rely for their day-to-day existence on good 
neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Each month, six families in Los Angeles and Orange counties contribute money 
to a pool to support six Bosnians -- including a baby who came for heart 
surgery and a double amputee -- who are living temporarily in a donated 
two-bedroom apartment in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Suad Krso, who lost both legs in a grenade blast in Bosnia and came to the 
United States for surgeries to prepare him for artificial legs, had lived as a 
house guest in Torrance and Garden Grove before moving in to the Van Nuys 
apartment with other disabled Bosnians. Krso, who is being treated at the Los 
Alamitos Medical Center, says they live together so they can help each other 
with daily tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our self-respect," Krso said through an interpreter. "We were always 
self-supporting people, and we don't like to be a burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Krso and his roommates worry constantly about family members in Bosnia who are 
threatened daily by gunfire. Though all are grateful for the refuge from the 
fighting and wish their families could join them in safety, most say they are 
eager to return to their beloved homeland when the war subsides. 
</P>
<P>
 Mufid Sokolovich, president of the American Bosnia-Herzegovina Assn., a 
nonprofit organization in Santa Ana that raises funds for the international 
Bosnian relief effort, said his group is renting a four-bedroom house in 
Cerritos where about 10 Bosnians, including Pajevic and those in the Van Nuys 
apartment, will move this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering that supporting these people will cost about $3,000 a month, or 
$36,000 a year, it is scary to think we don't know how long we have to keep it 
up," Sokolovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that he feels compelled to help the stranded Bosnians. "They came 
to me and asked me to save them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the July airlift, the number of Bosnians entering the United States for 
medical help has grown. The International Organization for Migration said its 
medical mission has evacuated 362 people from Bosnia, 57 of whom have been 
brought to the United States, with the remainder going to other Western 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting very good response from hospitals and doctors, and we are 
bringing in people practically every week," said Hans-Petter Boe, chief of 
mission at the IOM office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the plight of the IOM evacuees from Bosnia, the State 
Department is considering halting future medical airlifts of Bosnians to this 
country or changing the immigration status of future medical evacuees to make 
them eligible for welfare and other public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration authorities say that if the Bosnians had been admitted to the 
United States as "refugees," rather than tourists, they would have been 
entitled to federal cash grants, English classes and various job training and 
placement programs. But once they are in the United States, they are no longer 
entitled to refugee status, which is reserved for people overseas who are in 
imminent danger or detained in refugee camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Immigration and Naturalization Service officials say Bosnians 
will have no trouble remaining legally in the United States when their tourist 
visas expire in August because they can qualify to stay under "temporary 
protective status," which would entitle them to seek employment but would not 
give them the kind of federal financial assistance that people with refugee 
status receive. A newly created program, temporary protective status is 
available to foreign nationals fleeing war or environmental disaster from 
certain designated countries. 
</P>
<P>
 As a final alternative, the Bosnians could apply for political asylum. The 
backlog of applications for political asylum is so large, however, that it 
could "easily take a year or more" for the Bosnians' requests to be processed, 
INS spokesman Verne Jervis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has yet to decide whether people with temporary protective status 
would be eligible for state and county assistance to the poor, as are those 
granted asylum or refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
 IOM officials say that while they took responsibility for matching Bosnian 
patients with U.S. hospitals willing to treat them free and found homes where 
they could recuperate, the organization has no plan or funds to meet their 
long-term financial needs in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hands are empty. That is why we are not holding them out," Boe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone believes that the best solution is to grant the Bosnians 
temporary or permanent residency and then allow them to receive state- and 
county-paid general relief and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Leaman, Orange County's director of social services, said he is 
distressed by immigration practices that allow people into the United States 
who ultimately become a burden on county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the federal government is admitting people who have to turn to welfare to 
survive, the federal government should pay for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Bosnian medical evacuees said they are anxious to learn English 
but are certain that their medical disabilities would make it difficult, if not 
impossible, for them to work. When they were evacuated, they believed their 
financial needs would be met by the U.S. government, not by private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were happy to go to the United States and get quality medical care," said 
Meho Kerla, an evacuee living in Van Nuys who is blind in one eye. "I didn't 
ask any details because I knew when I came to the U.S., I wouldn't have to 
worry about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Others appear to be good candidates for employment if they can straighten out 
their immigration status. Mujo Bjelonja, 41, is an electronic engineer who is 
making rapid progress learning English, according to officials at Garfield 
Medical Center in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjelonja came to the hospital severely undernourished and too crippled to 
walk. He has received $300,000 worth of medical care, including complicated 
surgeries, and is now able to walk with a cane, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital let him stay on as a guest boarder after his treatment was 
completed in January, and Tuesday he moved into a furnished apartment provided 
by the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane McDermed, a hospital social worker, said the hospital feels a 
responsibility to Bjelonja. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan for him is to get him vocational rehabilitation and maybe some 
occupation," she said. "I am not going to put him in a shelter. We brought him 
over here. Because other people dropped the ball, we aren't going to."

O.C. SCHOOLS ARE BANNING POPULAR NEW GAME CRAZE; EDUCATION: BACKERS SAY POG 
TEACHES SPORTSMANSHIP. SCHOOL OFFICIALS CALL IT DISRUPTIVE, AKIN TO GAMBLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Children may be flipping over it, but principals at many schools throughout 
Orange County have had enough of a new game craze played with decorated milk 
caps known as POGs or Trovs. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials, saying POGs is akin to gambling and often disruptive, have 
banned or limited the game and its variant forms at about half the elementary 
and middle schools in the county, according to one estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The games are competitive and there is an element of gambling that is 
associated," Cypress Elementary School District Supt. William Eller said. "The 
other aspect is we found ourselves in the early stages of seeing POGs being 
involved in disputes between students. . . . POGs don't have anything to do 
with our curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
 The game is simple and played much like marbles, but with silver dollar-sized 
plastic and cardboard milk caps, similar to the flat circles once used to seal 
glass milk bottles. Players hurl a heavier plastic disc known as a "slammer" or 
"kini" onto a stack of the cardboard milk caps, known by trademarks of POG and 
Trov. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to flip the Trovs over by hitting them. Rules vary, with children 
playing for points or to keep the caps they've successfully flipped. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 Orange County youngsters, mostly between ages 6 and 13, have been 
caught up in the craze, either playing, trading or collecting the caps, 
according to TROV USA, an Orange-based company that has become one of the major 
suppliers of milk caps in the state. A pack of five randomly mixed Trov caps 
sells for $1.25. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun and you get stuff for free if you win," Steven Harris, 8, of Irvine, 
said during a recent tournament organized by TROV USA. 
</P>
<P>
 While school officials say the game has some positive effects on social 
interaction and can be a constructive activity, the craze has become disruptive 
at some campuses since POGs started becoming popular last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 John Thomas, director of student services for the Ocean View School District, 
estimates that POGs are banned on most of the district's campuses. The school 
district has 15 elementary and middle school campuses in Huntington Beach, 
Fountain Valley, Midway City and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we thought of it as just another game, like marbles," Thomas said. 
"But then it got to be consuming campuses. . . . Kids were taking advantage of 
other kids." 
</P>
<P>
 At Barker Elementary School in Garden Grove, Principal Vince Spinosa said 
children can play the game in the playground, but only before and after school. 
Students are asked to keep their caps in their backpacks during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The school banned the game during school hours this fall when a host of 
POG-related problems, such as arguments and accusations of theft, began to 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets very competitive," Spinosa said. "Although they were having great 
fun, it generated some ill will." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials also were concerned that students were missing out on 
physical exercise by spending their breaks playing POGs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any game that got to this point would probably be limited," Spinosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 POG playing had just begun only two weeks ago at Reilly Elementary School in 
Mission Viejo when the problems started, Principal Kathy Muelder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had students who started arguing over POGs, especially younger students 
who didn't really understand they could lose their caps," Muelder said. "It's 
basically a game of chance, without much educational value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could liken it to going to Las Vegas and losing your money on the 
table," she added. "Adults don't like that. And children don't like losing 
their chips." At one point, the school even tried to compromise, allowing the 
children to play if it was for points, not keeps. But that didn't work for 
long, and the school principal banned POGs from the campus two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Rancho Santa Margarita Intermediate School also decided Friday to 
end a compromise allowing children to play POG during lunch. While most 
students were having fun with the game and being responsible, Principal Walt 
Otto said problems were increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't allow ourselves to be in a situation where we're baby-sitting for 
POGs rather than running a school," he said. "It's a good social thing, but 
some kids are not as social as others and don't allow other people to have 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say parents and students for the most part have been 
cooperative once the decision was made to ban the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Wright, a sixth-grader at Del Obispo Elementary School in San Juan 
Capistrano, wishes he could play at school, but understands why he can't any 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids were gambling with them and playing for keeps," said Wright, who 
still plays at home and with friends in his neighborhood. "And you can't really 
bring things from home to school. People were getting mad because they were 
losing stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, think schools are overreacting in banning the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the concerns about kids gambling are misplaced," said Gerry Caterina 
of Huntington Beach, who has a son in the fifth grade. "Kids need to learn. 
When I was a kid we played marbles. We'd lose if we weren't good shooters. It 
teaches kids a little about gambling. If they don't like losing, it could be a 
very strong lesson that would keep them from gambling when they're older." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hodson, owner and founder of TROV USA, said he believes many schools 
haven't given the game a chance, although his sales have increased with the 
various campus prohibitions. (If children were playing all day long, he 
speculates, they'd get bored.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The principals don't know what it is," he said. "All of a sudden something 
has consumed their campus. So they shut it down rather than learn about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the game, which has taken off in Southern California, has been 
restricted or prohibited in half the elementary and middle schools in Orange 
County. County school officials haven't kept track of the number of schools 
where POG is now unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodson said the game teaches sportsmanship, how to win and lose, and most 
important fosters interaction between children in this age of video games and 
computers. He slams the idea that Trovs are associated with gambling, saying 
there's little difference between Trovs and old-fashioned marbles. 
</P>
<P>
 He also donates scores of Trovs to schools as rewards for good attendance and 
other incentives, and is developing a line of Trovs printed with educational 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have something the kids want," he said. "If this is going to help get 
their attention, use it." 
</P>
<P>
 POG has its roots in the Great Depression, when a similar game of milk caps 
became popular among children. The flying-chips were reborn in Hawaii about two 
years ago when a teacher at an Oahu elementary school rounded up milk covers 
from a dairy and introduced the game to her students.

CITIES SEEK SOLUTIONS TO DILEMMA OF HOMELESSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alvah Chapman's office in the Miami Herald building, where he is director of 
the board of Knight Ridder Newspapers, looks out over Biscayne Bay. On one side 
of the bay rises a luxurious apartment tower with units that rent for $2,000 a 
month. On the other, shanties are home to some of the poorest of the city's 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman moved recently, and his commute now takes him past the Mud Flats, one 
of Miami's grubbiest homeless encampments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exposure to that made me think I had to get involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His involvement is helping push Miami to adopt an ambitious strategy, 
including a special tax, to get the homeless out of the encampments that had 
become eye-arresting stains along the waterfront and highways. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami and across the nation, people are increasingly fed up with parks and 
sidewalks turned into campsites by the homeless, increasingly tired of 
panhandlers who seem to hassle them on every street corner. They are pressing 
for action -- not only to help the homeless but also to get them off the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, the City Council in late 1992 adopted an ordinance prohibiting 
camping in public places, a move prompted when homeless people began crowding 
into the Civic Center at night. An appeals court last week, in a sternly worded 
ruling, declared the ordinance unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Other governments, including Miami's, are reaching for responses that draw on 
public and private resources. Beyond providing food and shelter, some programs 
are seeking to treat people for the causes of their homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities have adopted initiatives that look a lot like the police sweeps of 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, where the available 1,903 shelter beds fall far short of 
meeting the needs of a homeless population estimated at 12,000, police arrest, 
ticket and fine homeless people for being menaces to public sanitation and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In between are cities such as Orlando, Fla., whose residents and officials 
worried that a growing population of street people do not belong in the city of 
Disney World. They answered with a screened-in pavilion where homeless people 
can be found sleeping round the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired of homelessness," said Marcia Martin, who monitors the 
situation for Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. "We 
are at a point in this nation where we can't afford the homeless crisis 
anymore. It's affecting who we are and how we look -- and we look terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Many federal and local officials have said they believe that the homelessness 
problem has grown so huge -- the number of people on the streets or in shelters 
each night is estimated at 700,000 -- that the traditional patchwork of soup 
kitchens and other efforts is no longer adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, an already massive homeless population -- 1993 estimates were 
80,000 -- is expected to become even larger because of the Northridge 
earthquake. While there are some very innovative local services, the demand far 
exceeds the supply, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the federal government is pushing cities to formally adopt 
strategies to address the problem -- and it is claiming a significant role for 
itself. Federal funding jumped from $570 million in 1993 to $823 million this 
year, and the Administration is expected to ask for nearly double that amount 
for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said he hopes to make a measurable difference by giving federal 
grants of $20 million each to a few cities developing comprehensive strategies 
to tackle the problem. Los Angeles and Washington have already been tapped as 
recipients, and Miami is likely to be named soon, Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami officials say they are hoping to attract a chunk of the new federal 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the city had done almost nothing to shelter homeless people. 
Instead, police arrested or hassled them for breaking laws against sleeping and 
eating in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a federal judge ordered the city to find a solution to the problem or 
create safe zones where homeless people could build their own shelters. That 
was exactly the kick in the pants that homeless advocates wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homelessness was not a priority in this city, but we've made it a priority," 
said Alex Penelas, the Dade County commissioner orchestrating the new homeless 
policy. "Why? Because a federal judge slapped us with an order and said: 'Do 
something about it,' business leaders got fed up with it, and it became an 
issue for opinion-makers." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the encampments will be cleared out and the occupants moved to 
three yet-to-be-constructed shelters, which will house 250 to 300 people each 
for seven to 30 days. Caseworkers will evaluate and counsel residents and send 
them to treatment centers for substance abuse or mental illness, if needed, or 
to transitional housing and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the plan, the county has passed a 1% tax on food and beverages at 
large restaurants, a measure that is expected to raise more than $21 million in 
three years. Chapman and other private citizens have committed to raising $8.5 
million to supplement the public money. 
</P>
<P>
 Dade County has already cleared out the Mud Flats and placed almost 100 of its 
former residents in treatment programs or transitional housing, such as the 
Palms Motel. One of the success stories at the Palms is 54-year-old Sid Morris, 
who said he has been without a home for a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not decide to come here," Morris said. "Miami forced me." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris is glad it did: "I have a roof over my head, TV, telephones and three 
meals a day," he said, lounging in a chair. "Those are things I can look 
forward to now." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he goes to substance-abuse classes and has cut down on crack, which he 
has used for a decade. "I use a whole lot less now than when I was on the Mud 
Flats." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials conceded that the Mud Flats effort is too expensive -- $40 per 
person per day -- to replicate on a large scale but said they expect to bring 
costs down as more of the plan goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials and some advocates for the homeless are critical of Miami's 
decision to build such large shelters -- which they believe are less effective 
than smaller facilities -- and for spending too much on shelters rather than on 
treatment programs and transitional housing. But county officials and Chapman 
say their plan is the only affordable way to reach all the homeless people who 
need help. 
</P>
<P>
 Caseworkers also say it is the most humane solution. "It may sound tough, but 
it's not," said Cynthia Hall, who works to aid Dade County's homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 While Miami is trying "tough love," other communities are just being tough. 
Like Miami, San Francisco is rooting people out of its parks and off its 
sidewalks -- but it is not offering anywhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of citations have been issued since August, when Mayor Frank Jordan 
directed police to arrest and issue $76 tickets to people for sleeping, camping 
or urinating in public or otherwise disturbing the "quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're out of the parks, but they're in the streets and the alleys," said 
Ray Masterson of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness. The shelter 
system falls so short of meeting the need, he said, that people have no other 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is a party in a class-action suit to bar the mayor from 
ticketing the homeless when they have no other place to live. It is one of a 
growing number of such suits across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time these actions have increased, so have the legal challenges 
to them," said Maria Foscarinis, director of the National Law Center on 
Homelessness and Poverty. She named San Francisco, Seattle and Atlanta as 
examples of cities with anti-homeless policies but stressed that "this is a 
problem in cities across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando was particularly troubled by the hundreds of homeless people who slept 
in its parks and in the heart of its downtown, which looks like a Western 
frontier town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real moral dilemma," Police Chief Tom Hurlburt said. "We're Orlando, 
Florida, the home of Mickey Mouse. We're friendly to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's solution -- a campus for the homeless -- has caught the eye of 
public policy-makers across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 500 people a day stay in Orlando's screened pavilion, which has a 
heated concrete floor with yellow lines resembling parking places. Late last 
year, Orlando opened a more comfortable facility -- with barracks-like 
accommodations for women and single rooms for families -- that holds about 180 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag -- $350,000 to build the pavilion and operating costs of $1.3 
million a year -- was reasonable, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only place I know that helps us out," said Edward Krieck, 49, who 
said he was released from prison three months ago after serving 15 years for 
murder. The $425 a month he receives in disability benefits is not enough to 
live elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some local advocates for the homeless and some of the homeless themselves 
say the shelters are dehumanizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Skipper Tompkins, 34, said the shelter helped him to survive but not to put 
his life together. "I believe places like this make people weaker, keep people 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Poole, the facility's director, defended the pavilion as a safety net 
for people who do not want to help themselves and whom society does not want to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place to come and flop," he said. "It's better than the streets -- 
it's not as good as a shelter. What we've been able to prove to this community 
is that it makes dollars and sense to provide some type of minimum help." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he conceded, "I'm not sure this is the right minimum. We're in a new 
frontier."

QUAKE PAYOUT TO BE INSURERS' 3RD HIGHEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Insurance companies will pay $2.5 billion in claims from the Northridge 
earthquake, making it the third-costliest insurance disaster in U.S. history 
but by far the most expensive temblor, according to the official industry 
estimate to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses are not expected to cause financial problems for the major 
providers of earthquake insurance in California, such as Allstate or State 
Farm. But some smaller companies with greater concentrations of their insurance 
risk in California may fail, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the insurance losses are massive, it is not clear whether they will 
result in higher earthquake insurance rates or in changes in policies -- 
although some previous natural disasters resulted in such moves. However, the 
losses have prompted a push by the insurance industry to get the federal 
government to assume more risk for covering earthquakes, floods and other 
natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers will receive "in excess of 200,000 claims" from the Jan. 17 quake, 
said Gary R. Kerney, executive director of Property Claims Services, a Rahway, 
N.J., organization that will release its estimate today. The organization 
surveys insurance companies to produce official catastrophe estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Florida's deadly Hurricane Andrew in 1992, with insured damage of $18 
billion, and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, at $4.2 billion, resulted in higher dollar 
value of insurance payouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in those disasters, insurers may bear as little as a tenth of the total 
cost of the Northridge earthquake because so much of the destruction was to 
uninsured publicly owned infrastructure such as highway overpasses, water works 
and public buildings. Gov. Pete Wilson has estimated that total losses from the 
quake could be as high as $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a large proportion of the damage to homes will not be covered 
because only one-third or fewer of all homes carry earthquake insurance, and 
most earthquake policies carry high deductibles so that minor damage will not 
appear on the insurance companies' books. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Northridge quake will be more than double the insurance costs 
wreaked by the Loma Prieta earthquake, which shook the San Francisco Bay Area 
in October, 1989, causing $960 million in insured damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Northridge, the Loma Prieta quake was the costliest temblor for the 
insurance industry, although in total damage it paled in comparison to the San 
Francisco earthquake of 1906, when there was virtually no insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 California's top two insurers, State Farm and Allstate, last week estimated 
that they would pay out $280 million and $350 million, respectively, in claims 
from the Northridge quake. Both totals far surpass the companies' claims from 
Loma Prieta. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerney, of Disaster Claims Services, said that earthquake damage is far more 
difficult for the industry to gauge than that of other disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a hurricane, all buildings are subject to the same kind of wind," he said. 
"But in a quake, the underlying soil conditions are a big determinant of 
whether a structure will be damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster has prompted a renewed push for federally subsidized earthquake 
insurance as part of an overall natural disaster program. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Loma Prieta, insurers have increased deductibles and taken other steps 
to reduce their exposure to earthquake insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
 California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi criticized State Farm for 
instantly adopting an 18-county moratorium on issuance of new earthquake 
policies after the Northridge quake. After negotiations, State Farm peeled back 
the area covered by its ban to Los Angeles and four other counties. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hurricane Andrew, which quadrupled the worst insurance disaster in 
history, some companies tried to exit the Florida market for homeowners 
insurance but were restrained from doing so by state insurance authorities.

CITIES SEEK SOLUTIONS TO DILEMMA OF HOMELESSNESS; STREETS: FUNDS ARE RAISED FOR 
IDEAS. SOLUTIONS NOW RANGE FROM MOTELS IN MIAMI TO FINES IN SAN FRANCISCO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Alvah Chapman's office in the Miami Herald building, where he is director of 
the board of Knight Ridder Newspapers, looks out over Biscayne Bay. On one side 
of the bay rises a luxurious apartment tower with units that rent for $2,000 a 
month. On the other, shanties are home to some of the poorest of the city's 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman moved recently, and his commute now takes him past the Mud Flats, one 
of Miami's grubbiest homeless encampments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exposure to that made me think I had to get involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His involvement is helping push Miami to adopt an ambitious strategy, 
including a special tax, to get the homeless out of the encampments that had 
become eye-arresting stains along the waterfront and highways. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami and across the nation, people are increasingly fed up with parks and 
sidewalks turned into campsites by the homeless, increasingly tired of 
panhandlers who seem to hassle them on every street corner. They are pressing 
for action -- not only to help the homeless but also to get them off the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, some local governments, including Miami's, are reaching for 
responses that draw on public and private resources. Beyond providing food and 
shelter, some programs are seeking to treat people for the causes of their 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities have adopted initiatives that look a lot like the police sweeps 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, where the available 1,903 shelter beds fall far short of 
meeting the needs of a homeless population estimated at 12,000, police arrest, 
ticket and fine homeless people for being menaces to public sanitation and 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In between are cities such as Orlando, Fla., whose residents and officials 
worried that a growing population of street people do not belong in the city of 
Disney World. They answered with a screened-in pavilion where homeless people 
can be found sleeping round the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired of homelessness," said Marcia Martin, who monitors the 
situation for Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros. "We 
are at a point in this nation where we can't afford the homeless crisis 
anymore. It's affecting who we are and how we look -- and we look terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Many federal and local officials have said they believe that the homelessness 
problem has grown so huge -- the number of people on the streets or in shelters 
each night is estimated at 700,000 -- that the traditional patchwork of soup 
kitchens and other efforts is no longer adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, an already massive homeless population -- 1993 estimates were 
80,000 -- is expected to become even larger because of the Northridge 
earthquake. While there are some very innovative local services, the demand far 
exceeds the supply, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the federal government is pushing cities to formally adopt 
strategies to address the problem -- and it is claiming a significant role for 
itself. Federal funding jumped from $570 million in 1993 to $823 million this 
year, and the Administration is expected to ask for nearly double that amount 
for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said he hopes to make a measurable difference by giving federal 
grants of $20 million each to a few cities developing comprehensive strategies 
to tackle the problem. Los Angeles and Washington have already been tapped as 
recipients, and Miami is likely to be named soon, Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami officials say they are hoping to attract a chunk of the new federal 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, the city had done almost nothing to shelter homeless people. 
Instead, police arrested or hassled them for breaking laws against sleeping and 
eating in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a federal judge ordered the city to find a solution to the problem or 
create safe zones where homeless people could build their own shelters. That 
was exactly the kick in the pants that homeless advocates wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homelessness was not a priority in this city, but we've made it a priority," 
said Alex Penelas, the Dade County commissioner orchestrating the new homeless 
policy. "Why? Because a federal judge slapped us with an order and said: 'Do 
something about it,' business leaders got fed up with it, and it became an 
issue for opinion-makers." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the encampments will be cleared out and the occupants moved to 
three yet-to-be-constructed shelters, which will house 250 to 300 people each 
for seven to 30 days. Caseworkers will evaluate and counsel residents and send 
them to treatment centers for substance abuse or mental illness, if needed, or 
to transitional housing and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the plan, the county has passed a 1% tax on food and beverages at 
large restaurants, a measure that is expected to raise more than $21 million in 
three years. Chapman and other private citizens have committed to raising $8.5 
million to supplement the public money. 
</P>
<P>
 Dade County has already cleared out the Mud Flats and placed almost 100 of its 
former residents in treatment programs or transitional housing, such as the 
Palms Motel. One of the success stories at the Palms is 54-year-old Sid Morris, 
who said he has been without a home for a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not decide to come here," Morris said. "Miami forced me." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris is glad it did: "I have a roof over my head, TV, telephones and three 
meals a day," he said, lounging in a chair. "Those are things I can look 
forward to now." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he goes to substance-abuse classes and has cut down on crack, which he 
has used for a decade. "I use a whole lot less now than when I was on the Mud 
Flats." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials conceded that the Mud Flats effort is too expensive -- $40 per 
person per day -- to replicate on a large scale but said they expect to bring 
costs down as more of the plan goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials and some advocates for the homeless are critical of Miami's 
decision to build such large shelters -- which they believe are less effective 
than smaller facilities -- and for spending too much on shelters rather than on 
treatment programs and transitional housing. But county officials and Chapman 
say their plan is the only affordable way to reach all the homeless people who 
need help. 
</P>
<P>
 Caseworkers also say it is the most humane solution. "It may sound tough, but 
it's not," said Cynthia Hall, who works to aid Dade County's homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 While Miami is trying "tough love," other communities are just being tough. 
Like Miami, San Francisco is rooting people out of its parks and off its 
sidewalks -- but it is not offering anywhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of citations have been issued since August, when Mayor Frank Jordan 
directed police to arrest and issue $76 tickets to people for sleeping, camping 
or urinating in public or otherwise disturbing the "quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're out of the parks, but they're in the streets and the alleys," said 
Ray Masterson of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness. The shelter 
system falls so short of meeting the need, he said, that people have no other 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is a party in a class-action suit to bar the mayor from 
ticketing the homeless when they have no other place to live. It is one of a 
growing number of such suits across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time these actions have increased, so have the legal challenges 
to them," said Maria Foscarinis, director of the National Law Center on 
Homelessness and Poverty. She named San Francisco, Seattle and Atlanta as 
examples of cities with anti-homeless policies but stressed that "this is a 
problem in cities across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando was particularly troubled by the hundreds of homeless people who slept 
in its parks and in the heart of its downtown, which looks like a Western 
frontier town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real moral dilemma," Police Chief Tom Hurlburt said. "We're Orlando, 
Florida, the home of Mickey Mouse. We're friendly to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's solution -- a campus for the homeless -- has caught the eye of 
public policy-makers across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 500 people a day stay in Orlando's screened pavilion, which has a 
heated concrete floor with yellow lines resembling parking places. Late last 
year, Orlando opened a more comfortable facility -- with barracks-like 
accommodations for women and single rooms for families -- that holds about 180 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag -- $350,000 to build the pavilion and operating costs of $1.3 
million a year -- was reasonable, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only place I know that helps us out," said Edward Krieck, 49, who 
said he was released from prison three months ago after serving 15 years for 
murder. The $425 a month he receives in disability benefits is not enough to 
live elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some local advocates for the homeless and some of the homeless themselves 
say the shelters are dehumanizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Skipper Tompkins, 34, said the shelter helped him to survive but not to put 
his life together. "I believe places like this make people weaker, keep people 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Poole, the facility's director, defended the pavilion as a safety net 
for people who do not want to help themselves and whom society does not want to 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place to come and flop," he said. "It's better than the streets -- 
it's not as good as a shelter. What we've been able to prove to this community 
is that it makes dollars and sense to provide some type of minimum help." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he conceded, "I'm not sure this is the right minimum. We're in a new 
frontier."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON'S '95 BUDGET BELIES SPEND IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Clinton Administration unveils its 1995 budget today, it will reveal 
a surprising new reality about politics and policy-making in this company town: 
Even an activist Democratic President is willing to dismantle longstanding 
liberal social programs that do not seem to be working very well. 
</P>
<P>
 From almost the moment he took office, Clinton has been characterized by 
conservatives as a classic tax-and-spend liberal bent on throwing taxpayer 
money at every problem he confronts. But the $1.5-trillion budget his 
Administration will deliver to Congress this morning will almost certainly 
belie that spendthrift image. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1 contains significant 
cuts in such sacred cows as assistance for poor people with big energy bills, 
construction of public housing in America's inner cities and operating 
subsidies for metropolitan mass transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot just constantly rubber-stamp the programs that are in place now," 
White House Budget Director Leon E. Panetta said Sunday on ABC-TV's "This Week 
With David Brinkley." "I think that is good management." 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, Clinton plans to cut $30 billion from existing federal programs 
next year in order to comply with the harsh spending limits imposed by his own 
five-year, $500-billion deficit-reduction package, which was approved by 
Congress last August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton budget includes proposals to completely eliminate funding for 
about 115 programs. While most are relatively small, all have protective 
constituencies and congressional allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has little choice but to cut. The deficit crisis of the late 1980s and 
early 1990s finally forced Washington to face up to the harsh reality that 
America could no longer afford the rich array of social benefits put in place 
over the previous three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Under separate deficit-reduction agreements passed in 1990 and 1993, taxes 
were raised, spending was reined in and tough new rules were imposed to make it 
difficult for either the President or Congress to launch expensive new 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the ironies of modern politics, the fiscal squeeze forced Clinton, a 
Democratic activist who believes that government can and should intervene in 
the economy, to curb his own desire to reinvigorate programs that languished 
under 12 years of Republican rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Clinton will attempt to increase funding for some of his pet policy 
initiatives in areas such as job training, preschool programs, high technology 
and public health. Of the $30 billion that Clinton proposes to squeeze from 
existing programs, he wants to put at least $16 billion back into his 
"investment agenda" priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta noted, for instance, that the budget will include $2.7 billion in new 
funds for the President's crime-prevention initiative. Similarly, new 
technology programs designed to help the defense industry convert to civilian 
enterprises will go up 40% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's efforts to shift funds toward his priorities will be fiercely 
opposed by supporters of existing programs slated for cuts. Last year, 
Clinton's "investment agenda" received about 69% of the funding the 
Administration requested because of the tight budget constraints. What's more, 
previous Republican administrations proposed many of the same reductions 
Clinton will announce today, only to see Congress restore funding later. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that the cuts are being proposed at all could signal that some 
Democrats are coming to grips with the policy and political consequences of 
limited financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of the changing climate is the increasing frequency with which 
liberals are attacking the agenda of the President they helped elect, accusing 
Clinton of being too modest in his policy ambitions and too narrowly focused on 
deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sit here and say that George Bush would have done the same 
thing, or Ronald Reagan . . . (but) I think there are similarities in this 
budget in terms of proposed cuts that this President has offered and what we 
have seen in previous years from Mr. Reagan or Mr. Bush," Rep. Kweisi Mfume 
(D-Md.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Sunday on NBC-TV's 
"Meet the Press." "I'm not satisfied with the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, liberals are already beginning to argue that because the new budget 
will show a rapidly shrinking deficit, it is time for Washington to ease up on 
spending constraints and fully fund domestic programs that continue to 
languish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone too far over toward deficit reduction," said Jeff Faux, 
president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington. 
"It is time for Clinton to go back to the investment agenda that he talked 
about during the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said on the ABC program that the Clinton budget would estimate a 1995 
deficit of $176 billion, far below the $302 billion estimate made when Clinton 
took office a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $126-billion reduction, Panetta said $22 billion would be attributable 
to the improving economy; more Americans are working and paying more federal 
taxes, and the cost of providing assistance to the poor and unemployed is 
declining. But he said the remaining amount of deficit savings is attributable 
to passage of the Clinton economic plan, which reduced federal spending and 
raised taxes in roughly equal amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In late January, the Congressional Budget Office released an even more 
optimistic deficit forecast, predicting the annual shortfall would drop to $171 
billion in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta dismissed suggestions that the improving budget outlook gives Clinton 
room to open the spending spigot again. He said the "hard freeze" on 
discretionary spending imposed by last year's deficit-reduction agreement 
should be seen as an opportunity to make strategic decisions about which 
functions the government should continue to perform for society and which it 
should abandon or turn over to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the opportunity to exercise good fiscal discipline with regard to 
federal spending provides one great opportunity for this country, which is to 
prioritize programs, to decide what programs we don't need, to decide what 
programs we can cut, to decide what areas we shouldn't get into and to focus 
our investments in the areas we think are important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has used that standard in preparing the 1995 budget, he said. For 
example, in mass transit, the Administration decided it makes sense to help 
cities build transit systems, but not to subsidize their operating losses. The 
subsidies, Panetta said, simply allow local officials to keep fares 
artificially low.

MOUNTAINS RISE AND WHICH WAY CITIES MOVE AFTER MAJOR QUAKES. 
</P>

<P>
 Andrea Donnellan kneels on the barren crest of Oat Mountain and, with her 
Powerbook computer coupled to a tiny satellite receiver, pinpoints the shards 
of Southern California's broken landscape with an unsettling accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is as she suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,477-foot-tall mountain, heaving upward since the moment of the 6.6 
Northridge earthquake last month, has grown another inch since she last 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is mountain-building in progress," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Oat Mountain is about 14 inches taller -- exactly 36 centimeters -- as 
a result of the earthquake. The mountain, which stands like a garden wall 
between the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, also moved nearly nine 
inches to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge itself was distorted like a Salvador Dali watch -- with a 
38-square-mile oval of ground on which it rests now bulging a foot higher and 
skewed to the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be time to start redrawing the property lines. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to surveying the Santa Susana Mountains or the San Fernando 
Valley, geophysicists such as Donnellan and her colleagues can calculate the 
effects of the Earth's sudden spasms to the nearest millimeter through a 
$12-billion Defense Department satellite network called the Global Positioning 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon developed the satellite navigation system, which became fully 
operational in July, to maneuver troops, position its ships and target its 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same revolution in measuring technology that enables military planners 
to aim their missiles with unprecedented precision and Desert Storm Stealth 
pilots to find Baghdad in the dark also allows Donnellan at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory and other geologists to track the shifting of the Earth's crust as 
tectonic plates jostle like icebergs in a floe. 
</P>
<P>
 Space geodesy -- the ability to survey the Earth from orbit -- has given 
geologists new eyes, transforming their vision of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 By using the satellites to monitor the San Fernando Valley, Donnellan and her 
colleagues developed an unusually comprehensive profile of the strains building 
up in there. That led them to raise the possibility of a major earthquake in 
the area in a scientific paper published two months before the Northridge 
temblor. They could not say when such a quake would hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came up with an estimate of a 6.4 earthquake, which is pretty close to 
what actually happened," she said. "GPS is a very elegant tool to use." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the satellite system is transforming nearly every endeavor in which 
location matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines are experimenting with the system to eliminate delays and save fuel 
by identifying more direct routes for passenger jets. In Tokyo, tour bus 
operators are using GPS receivers to trigger recorded lectures for sightseers 
when their buses pass a notable landmark, while paleontologists are using 
portable receivers to navigate the trackless Gobi Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend campers use it to keep from losing their way in wilderness -- at least 
those who can afford to pack the $795 hand-held receivers in their gear. 
Naturalists in Montana monitor elk by tagging them with GPS collars. Foresters 
even use GPS to inventory trees. 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps no surprise then that many experts call the system the most 
significant development in space technology since the communications satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the first precise, inexpensive measuring system," said geophysicist 
Duncan C. Agnew at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and UC San Diego. 
"You can make precise measurements over thousands of miles. We are all amazed 
by it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellites are a high-tech variant of a centuries-old celestial navigation 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Circling the Earth every 20 hours, 24 GPS satellites constantly transmit their 
position, identity and the time the signal was broadcast. The satellite clocks 
are synchronized with each other and with a master atomic clock on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with a GPS receiver can pick up the satellite signal, compare the time 
it was sent with the time it was received and, by calculating the difference, 
determine how far away the satellite is. By tuning in to at least three GPS 
satellites, the receiver quickly can pinpoint its position anywhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know where the satellites are, you know where you are," Donnellan 
said. "When you can have three or more satellites, you can place yourself 
pretty accurately. It is like drawing intersecting circles." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Defense Department, which spent 20 years developing it, the system 
allows any ship, plane, submarine or soldier with a GPS satellite receiver to 
locate itself to within 15 feet anywhere in the world. Because the signals are 
beamed from space, they effectively are impossible to jam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon, concerned that someone might turn the technology against its 
inventors, guards its navigation system by reserving the most precise GPS 
signals for itself. The transmissions that would enable someone to receive the 
most exact positioning information are encrypted. Others contain intentional 
"spoofing" errors that only the Pentagon can detect and filter out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon does make five powerful signals from GPS satellites accessible to 
civilian receivers. For these non-military users, that is sufficient to locate 
themselves to within 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But geodetic experts -- as scientists who specialize in precise Earth 
measurements are called -- are wringing much greater accuracy from those 
signals, enough to make some Pentagon planners uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 To hone their calculations, specialists such as Donnellan and Agnew combine 
the resources of NASA's 45 global tracking sites, conventional surveying and 
sophisticated computer processing to determine the precise position. The 
special $35,000 receivers they use, developed by JPL, can extract some useful 
information from the Pentagon's coded signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that they can improve each geodetic survey measurement from 100 
yards to one that is accurate within an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 That should pose no threat to anybody, the geologists hasten to explain, 
because it is not the sort of thing one could do under battlefield fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the advent of GPS, the most advanced geodetic technique used distant 
quasars as measuring sticks, a method that required the use of large radio 
telescopes -- not the sort of thing a field geologist could tote up a 
mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
 "GPS is definitely helpful because it tells you what the broad picture is 
quickly," said Tousson R. Toppozada, a seismologist with the state Division of 
Mines and Geology. "GPS will tell you the mountains went up with respect to the 
valley. Without GPS, we would have to wait months to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 To geologists, the satellite measurements reveal a world in which the Earth 
creeps at the speed that fingernails grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are patient, you can see very small motions . . . five millimeters 
over five years," Agnew said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente Island hurtles north past San Diego at a rate of one-fifth of an 
inch every year, according to Agnew's recent satellite survey. Catalina rumbles 
toward Palos Verdes at a speed of one-tenth of an inch each year. The entire 
Santa Barbara Channel is snapping shut at about three-tenths of an inch every 
year, his measurements show. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the motion revealed by the GPS satellites is natural. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent satellite survey of the Tucson Basin in Arizona revealed that the 
1,000-square-mile area is sinking about two inches a year because people have 
pumped out so much ground water that the aquifer is collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists are especially intrigued with the way the satellite measurements 
reveal how the ground shifts as a result of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has made a huge difference to us," said geodetic specialist Ken Hudnut at 
the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after last month's big quake, Hudnut and his colleagues 
scrambled to set out 16 portable GPS receivers around the area so they could 
measure how far the Earth had shifted at the 100 benchmarks they had surveyed 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Each receiver, not much larger than a portable videotape recorder, is housed 
in an unobtrusive steel lockbox and powered by a pair of car batteries that 
have to be recharged about every 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Yehuda Bock at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences at the 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who works closely with Hudnut and 
Donnellan, already had a permanent network of 10 GPS receiving stations in 
place, scattered from San Diego in the south to Vandenberg Air Force Base in 
the north. Those receivers update their position every 30 seconds and report 
their data daily. Any variation caused by the shifting crust or a sudden quake 
is recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 The instant the Northridge quake hit, the Los Angeles Basin -- stretching from 
Palos Verdes to Pasadena -- shrank by half an inch, according to Bock's GPS 
measurements. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, experts were not able to capture enough information about an 
earthquake fast enough to understand just how such an upheaval unfolds. It 
could take months to painstakingly resurvey each benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
 By combining all their data, Donnellan, Hudnut and Bock were able to take a 
"snapshot" of the Earth in flux, from precise measurements of the rising Santa 
Susanas to the fractional shifts in the positions of a dozen communities around 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Bock set up another GPS receiver in Chatsworth. In six months, he 
hopes to have five more installed around Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnellan, Hudnut and Bock are casting a net to snare an earthquake. As they 
wire Southern California into a GPS network, the scientists hope they may catch 
a glimpse of the subtle signs that may precede a temblor, giving them the 
rudimentary tools to one day predict when a major quake might occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking to see if there are any signals that will give us some clues 
to unraveling earthquakes -- how they happen, what happens during one and the 
patterns that may lead up to it," Bock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Extrapolating from ground movements during the Northridge quake, they could 
reconstruct what happened at the focal point of the temblor more than 11 miles 
below the Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 There, they believe, a patch of rock about 32 square miles slipped about 18 
feet along the angled face of the deeply buried thrust fault. The energy 
unleashed by the movement was enough to claim at least 57 lives and cause $30 
billion damage to the region above. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little bit deeper than some of our earthquakes have been," Hudnut 
said. "The displacement of the fault gets muted by the overlying rock. That 
damped the ground movement for this earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks after the Northridge quake, the GPS stations showed that the 
Earth continued to deform. One brutal aftershock kicked Oat Mountain half an 
inch backward. 
</P>
<P>
 As they continue to sift through the measurements gathered from the quake, 
scientists hope to detect some pattern that may presage a major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are examining the Northridge data for possible variations in the 
contraction rate," Bock said. "We are excited about the prospects, but right 
now we can't say if there is anything for sure." A Moving Experience 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how far some communities were moved by the Northridge quake according 
to Global Positioning System measurements: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Oat Mountain: up 14.8 inches and moved northwest 8.4 inches 
</P>
<P>
 2) Fillmore: moved 2 inches west 
</P>
<P>
 3) Castaic: dropped 3.5 inches and moved 4.3 inches southwest 
</P>
<P>
 4) Santa Paula: west about 2 inches 
</P>
<P>
 5) Moorpark: west about 2 inches 
</P>
<P>
 6) Point Dume: north 1.5 inches 
</P>
<P>
 7) Glendale: moved east 0.5 inches and up 2 inches 
</P>
<P>
 8) Topanga Canyon at Mulholland: moved north 3 inches and up 1.3 inches 
</P>
<P>
 9) Van Norman Reservoir at intersection of I-5 and 405: moved east 7 inches 
and up 8 inches

U.N. CHIEF URGES NATO TO APPROVE BOSNIA AIR STRIKES; BALKANS: EARLIER, CLINTON 
AVOIDED THE ISSUE, SAYING THAT THE SARAJEVO SHELLING SHOULD SPUR PEACE TALKS. 
IT IS UNKNOWN WHEN THE WESTERN ALLIES' COUNCIL WILL MEET.

<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged NATO on Sunday to authorize 
air strikes on artillery positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, hours after President 
Clinton sidestepped pressure to undertake military retaliation for the shelling 
that killed 68 people in a Sarajevo marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.N. official said Boutros-Ghali had sent a letter to Manfred 
Woerner, the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
asking the NATO Council to approve "the launching of air strikes against 
artillery positions in and around Sarajevo, which are responsible for attacks 
on civilian targets." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no word on when the NATO Council, made up of the foreign ministers 
of the 16 member nations, would meet to consider the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who said the shelling Saturday should spur the warring Muslims, Serbs 
and Croats to the peace table, cautioned that NATO must grant its approval 
before any such air operations could begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton held a rare Sunday meeting with senior members of his national 
security team. He said afterward that the failure of peace talks would 
reinforce a U.S. proposal to lift the embargo on the shipment of arms to the 
Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks made clear his aversion to using air power to still the 
fighting in Bosnia, despite an assurance from Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) that there is "strong bipartisan support" in the Senate for such a 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling on the President to take the lead in shaping an allied response to the 
attack, Dole said in an interview, "what it cries out for is leadership -- 
American leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding with irritation to the pressure for air strikes, Clinton said, 
"It's very well for these members of Congress to say that -- they don't have 
constituents on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on CNN 
after the emergency meeting at the White House that "we are working at the 
highest level" with NATO allies on the question of conducting air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a U.N. Security Council resolution, Boutros-Ghali has the right to order 
air strikes to protect Sarajevo's civilian population. But he said at a news 
conference last week that it was pointless for him to order air strikes unless 
the NATO Council agreed to carry them out. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Woerner, dispatched Sunday night, he asked for that approval 
"as soon as possible," the U.N. source said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not called on the (NATO) Southern Command to start bombing" but only 
to have the option of doing so, another U.N. official said late Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO voted in August to provide air strikes on Serbian troops ringing Sarajevo 
if the United Nations requested them. NATO leaders toughened their stance last 
month but had been waiting for Boutros-Ghali's request. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Boutros-Ghali's aides have resented insinuations that he is 
the main stumbling block to the use of air power in Bosnia. With the letter, he 
was evidently trying to make clear his readiness to order strikes if the United 
States and other NATO members would carry them out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Saturday's attack and others that preceded it, U.S. 
officials have emphasized that one of the obstacles to carrying out air raids 
is determining who is responsible for the shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The President asked Albright to accelerate the U.N. effort to determine 
responsibility for the shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it seems highly likely that the Serbs are responsible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials have said that because the allied intelligence-gathering 
apparatus in Bosnia is so limited, it is difficult to tell which forces 
actually did the shelling Saturday -- Serb-backed artillery or Muslim or 
Croatian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a weekend conference on security issues in Munich, Germany, 
William J. Perry, the new U.S. defense secretary, said participating defense 
ministers considered "powerful countervailing arguments" about whether to 
launch air strikes or to take "other strong action." 
</P>
<P>
 He said officials need to determine what the objective of such missions would 
be and what they would accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, television pictures of the aftermath of the attack were "just 
horrifying" and brought "pressure to bear for more action." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, U.S. action has been limited to the dispatch of Air Force cargo planes 
to help ferry Sarajevo's wounded to hospitals in Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton met in the White House map room for 30 to 40 minutes Sunday with 
Albright, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake, Undersecretary of Defense John M. Deutch and White House Chief of 
Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty. 
</P>
<P>
 After directing his national security team to meet again today without him, he 
left for Houston, where he is to begin a three-day speaking tour through the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, speaking with reporters after the Munich meeting, said the principle 
option available to the United States is to "try to accelerate the peace 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Cautioning against a "spasmodic reaction" -- an emotional response that is not 
thought out -- Perry said, "It would be compounding the tragedy if we did not 
use this as an opportunity to drive everyone back to the peace table." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, speaking with reporters as he left the White House for his trip to 
Texas, said some nations are refusing to support any air strikes because they 
fear their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia would be subject to retaliation. Among 
those that have raised objections are Canada and Britain, whose troops are 
among the 28,000 lightly armed peacekeepers there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That does not mean it won't happen. We're discussing it with our allies," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing the hope that the shelling would bring the warring sides to peace 
talks, Clinton said, "I hope that the shock of these deaths will reinforce to 
them as to the rest of the world that they ought to go on and reach a 
settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure on Clinton to press NATO to approve air strikes is coming from 
both Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, said on CNN, "We have the technical capability to go in there with 
air power, supplemented by a very limited number of people on the ground to 
direct those bombs to where we want them to hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said that simply lifting the embargo on arms shipments to the Muslims 
"would send a strong signal" to the Serbs' backers in Belgrade, the capital of 
what remains of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Air strikes, he said, "could probably take out most of the artillery," 
restoring a military balance that would bring the three sides to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Stanley Meisler in Washington, Art Pine in Munich and Paul 
Richter in Houston contributed to this report.

GUINIER'S AUDIENCE GROWS AFTER DUMPING BY CLINTON; CIVIL RIGHTS: PROFESSOR HAS 
AN AGENT, HER ARTICLES WILL BE PUBLISHED AS A BOOK. SHE IS A BIG DRAW IN L.A. 
VISIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight months after she was unceremoniously abandoned by President Clinton, who 
had nominated her to head the Justice Department's civil rights division, law 
professor Lani Guinier has gained an audience for her unwavering views on race 
relations that is broader than she ever could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinier spent the weekend in Los Angeles being honored as "a champion of 
justice" by a gathering of 550 mostly African American lawyers and their 
spouses at a formal dinner and lauded at the First African Methodist Episcopal 
Church. Today she will speak at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinier is in such demand as a speaker that she has had to hire an agent. 
Soon, a collection of her once-obscure law review articles on voting rights 
will be published in a book. She has attained perhaps the ultimate sign of 
celebrityhood -- taxi drivers recognize her. And among those applauding her 
remarks at Saturday night's gathering of lawyers was Fritz Schombee, South 
Africa's consul general in Los Angeles, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
 It's quite a distance from a year ago when Guinier, although well known in 
civil rights circles, was teaching in relative anonymity at the University of 
Pennsylvania Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she had been confirmed, she wouldn't have as much influence as she does 
now. Thank you, Mr. President," said Reginald A. Holmes, president of the John 
M. Langston Bar Assn., which sponsored her trip here. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinier agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think of myself as a celebrity," she said. "I didn't break 
Hank Aaron's home run record. I don't consider celebrityhood a reward. I see it 
as an opportunity, that comes with many burdens, to reach out to many people 
who are hungry for a real dialogue about race relations. . . . Because of the 
very public way in which my conscience or my principles were 'revealed' to the 
country, there may be more people who are curious or intrigued than there were 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 During her stormy and abortive nomination battle, Guinier was bashed as a 
"quota queen" who urged preferences for racial minorities. In her law review 
articles, she advocated a variety of proposals designed to enhance the power of 
black voters and black lawmakers, who she said were still being denied rights 
granted to them under the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 and amendments to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 In her speech and in an interview with The Times, Guinier said Americans are 
in "a state of denial about race." 
</P>
<P>
 "In a strange way, my nomination came to symbolize the state of denial we find 
ourselves in about civil rights in particular and race in general," Guinier 
told the Langston dinner Saturday night. "Americans support the advancement of 
individual black achievers . . . but when it comes to discussing race, our 
policy comes close to the one on gays in the military: Don't ask, don't tell, 
don't pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 Americans of all shades fall prey to stereotyping, said Guinier, the daughter 
of a black father and a Jewish mother. "Relations are largely characterized by 
serious misunderstandings and a massive failure to communicate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the discomfort reflects the polarization of the last 12 years, in 
which national civil rights policy emphasized reverse discrimination, fed white 
fears of racial preferences and discussed discrimination exclusively in terms 
of innocent victims and guilty perpetrators rather than as an institutional or 
structural phenomenon in which we all participate," Guinier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When civil rights is reduced to the idea of blameworthy individuals, it is 
not surprising that many resist its message. No one wants to be called names." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Clinton, her longtime friend and former classmate at Yale Law School, 
Guinier said she has not heard from him since he withdrew her nomination last 
June, before she had an opportunity to explain her views at a Senate hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinier said she hoped that some of the issues she wanted to discuss in her 
Senate hearing would be aired at the forthcoming confirmation hearing of Boston 
attorney Deval Patrick, who was nominated last week by Clinton for the Justice 
Department job she had hoped to hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very talented; he's very committed; he's a very good lawyer," Guinier 
said of Patrick, one of her former colleagues at the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund. "My only concern is that he can't do what needs to be done 
alone," and thus far Clinton has not made civil rights enforcement a priority 
of his Administration, Guinier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attorney General Janet Reno has made some very good speeches and has 
announced a couple of good cases, but given the need in this country for more 
aggressive civil rights enforcement and the opportunity for this Administration 
to live up to its campaign rhetoric, there really is a vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Radcliffe College and Yale Law School, Guinier served for four 
years as the special assistant to Drew S. Days, while he headed the Justice 
Department's civil rights division in President Jimmy Carter's Administration. 
Then, from 1981 to 1988, she was assistant counsel and director of the voting 
rights project of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the nonprofit civil rights 
organization founded in 1940 by Thurgood Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 During those seven years, she successfully lobbied in Congress to extend the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965. She also won several major federal court lawsuits, 
including one that required Arkansas, while Clinton was governor, to reform its 
methods of registering voters, which had allowed local registrars to 
discriminate against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 She then became an associate professor of law at the University of 
Pennsylvania. Her views on voting rights were articulated in several lengthy 
and complicated law review articles that were favorably reviewed by her 
academic colleagues who unanimously granted her tenure. But the articles became 
the focus of attack by her critics after Clinton nominated her for the Justice 
Department position. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinier maintained that her views had been severely distorted by politicians, 
including Clinton, and some of the news media, whom she accused of "drive-by 
journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that even Justice Department lawyers in President George Bush's 
Administration had advocated some of the same solutions she proposed to remedy 
schemes designed to dilute the voting power of blacks in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinier said she did not advocate quotas or even write about them. She reminds 
people that she wrote articles raising questions about the merit of creating 
"safe" electoral districts for minority voters. She said such districts may 
exacerbate conflicts between whites and minorities and among competing minority 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Guinier said she concluded that many of her critics were not 
focused on her ideas. "They were focused on getting rid of me." 
</P>
<P>
 But she stressed that she does not see herself as a victim. "Unlike many 
blacks, Asians, Latinos, women and disabled people I have a job, a lifetime job 
as a tenured professor. . . . I am not a victim seeking sympathy. I am a 
democratic idealist who is committed to working with people of goodwill to make 
America live up to its own democratic ideals." 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of her serious remarks to lawyers Saturday night, Guinier said 
fame had brought her some amusing moments. On a recent rainy day in 
Philadelphia, she said, a taxi driver pulled up in front of her and said his 
passenger knew her and wanted to take her to the airport. Guinier said she 
peered into the taxi and did not recognize the man in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked at me and, smiling broadly, said, 'Zoe Baird!' " confusing Guinier 
with the white woman lawyer who was Clinton's first nominee for attorney 
general. Baird had to withdraw after a controversy arose because she had 
employed an undocumented immigrant as a nanny.

U.S. TEAMS RUSH TO EVACUATE 125 SHELLING VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American medical teams swept into Sarajevo on Sunday to help evacuate 
civilians injured when a powerful mortar shell smashed into a crowded 
marketplace, killing 68 people. 
</P>
<P>
 As the international community debated how to respond to Saturday's attack, 
the bloodiest since Bosnia-Herzegovina's civil war began, three U.S. military 
cargo planes and an International Red Cross IL-76 jet ferried victims to safety 
and treatment in Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, more than 125 people had been evacuated, including some wounded 
and sick who had been waiting for months for a chance to leave for outside 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Janowski of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said 
the overwhelming response "was proportionate to the barbarity of what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in Sarajevo was moved by the speed of the response," Janowski said. 
"It's hard to come up with a scale of outrage. But (the attack) was at the top 
of the scale of outrage." 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuations followed the firing of a 120-millimeter shell into a 
marketplace jammed with shoppers lured outside during good weather to replenish 
their meager provisions. The attack left more than 200 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring of anger and grief continued Sunday as families and friends of 
the dead streamed to the marketplace to weep and lay flowers at the 
bloodstained site. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials examined the crater but failed to pinpoint which of Bosnia's 
warring parties was responsible for the attack. The Muslim-led government 
blamed the Bosnian Serb artillery gunners surrounding the city. The Serbs 
denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crater analysis has been done, and we've got nothing more to say on that 
right now," said Matthew Nerzig, a U.N. spokesman. Although Nerzig said U.N. 
experts had been able to determine that the shell was fired from north to 
northeast of the market, "if we were able to pinpoint (its origin) we would do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the United Nations' top civilian official for the former Yugoslav 
federation, Yasushi Akashi, arrived in Sarajevo on a mission to negotiate a 
truce. He met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Bosnia's Muslim 
president, Alija Izetbegovic, but could not reach an agreement on a cease-fire 
and the monitoring of weapons around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi said an emergency meeting of the Security Council may be held in the 
next two days. Peace talks among Bosnia's warring Muslims, Serbs and Croats are 
scheduled to resume Thursday in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the international community scrambled to find an appropriate 
response to the scenes of tragedy and gore. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization to approve air strikes on artillery positions around Sarajevo, a 
senior U.N. official said late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian, French, Turkish and Italian leaders were among those who had earlier 
voiced support for the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said peace cannot be imposed militarily on the former Yugoslav 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
 British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd warned that a retaliatory air strike 
may yield "simply one day of satisfaction . . . followed not by the lifting of 
the siege but by its intensification." 
</P>
<P>
 European Union peace envoy Lord Owen spoke out against air strikes for fear 
the United Nations would then be drawn into the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, humanitarian organizations were able to use the media attention 
directed at Sarajevo to assist some of those suffering. Western governments and 
international aid agencies, moved by the grisly scenes on television screens, 
were able to cut through the red tape that has impeded previous evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
 This operation, said Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency, 
moved at "the speed of light." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the evacuees were headed for the U.S. air base at Ramstein, Germany, 
and treatment at a nearby medical center in Landstuhl. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were taken to medical facilities in Italy.

BUDGET OFFICE REPORT CRUCIAL FOR HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is President Clinton's health care reform plan a sophisticated effort to 
harness the power of the free market to finance universal coverage? Or is it 
simply a big dose of Big Government? 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict rendered by Congress and the American people could determine 
whether the Clinton plan lives or dies. And on Tuesday, in what many observers 
say they believe will be a defining moment in this year's health care debate, 
the Congressional Budget Office will render an initial opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the nonpartisan CBO is the official arbiter for Congress on such 
matters, its analysis is being viewed by many experts as the equivalent of a 
Supreme Court ruling on health care. Even White House officials acknowledge 
that a favorable CBO report is critical to Administration efforts to advance 
Clinton's initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, three leading business groups, the Business Roundtable, the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Assn. of Manufacturers, stunned the 
Administration by announcing their opposition to its proposal, and health care 
analysts say they doubt that the Clinton plan can survive a negative assessment 
by the CBO. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Rodney King verdict of health care reform," said one senior 
health care staffer in the Senate, describing the importance of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In its analysis, the CBO will announce whether it believes that the insurance 
"premium" that all Americans and their employers will be required to pay under 
the Clinton plan should actually be defined as a new "tax." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the question will be addressed as part of a larger CBO analysis 
of the costs of the plan. For the most part, Congress will rely on its 
estimates of the potential price tag of the Clinton reform plan and the size of 
the premiums needed to cover its costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While CBO analysts have used data provided by the Administration, their 
estimates may vary significantly from the official figures released by the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent private analysis conducted by Lewin-VHI, a Fairfax, Va., health 
care consulting firm, found that the mandatory premiums will have to be 17% 
higher than the Administration has estimated in order to cover the costs of 
Clinton's benefit plan, including proposed subsidies for small businesses and 
the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 If the insurance premium is considered a tax, and private-sector health 
premiums become part of the federal budget, many Americans would regard the 
Clinton plan as a vast expansion of the federal government's role in the health 
care arena -- a view the Administration desperately wants to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we ought to be trapped by what I call the budget wonks, or 
score-keeping issues," White House Budget Director Leon E. Panetta said Sunday 
on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful that its initiative would be seen as a form of socialized medicine, 
the Administration has sought to design a proposal that would restructure the 
health care system without appearing to stage a government takeover of private 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, it quickly rejected a "single-payer" health system, like those 
found in Canada and many European countries, that would be operated and 
financed directly by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Clinton embraced the concept of "managed competition," in which 
quasi-governmental health alliances would collect mandatory premiums from 
workers and their employers, then buy insurance for them from a handful of 
private insurers. The idea is to have the alliances act as buying cooperatives, 
using their size and savvy to bargain for lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The only portion of the Clinton proposal the Administration believes should 
show up on the government's financial records are the federal subsidies, most 
of which would go to help small businesses, retirees and low-income workers pay 
their new premiums to the alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Those new subsidies, the Administration says, could be financed from cost 
savings in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and from revenues from new taxes 
on cigarettes and other tobacco products and on corporations that decide not to 
join the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the Administration asserts, the reform measures would yield enough 
costs savings in Medicare and Medicaid to reduce the federal budget deficit by 
$58 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we are on the cutting edge of developing good, solid cost 
estimates," said Gene Sperling, a White House policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration's delicate cost structure could come crashing down if 
the CBO declares that the entire managed-competition system -- not just the 
federal subsidies -- should be considered part of the government's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican health care analysts say the bookkeeping change would boost future 
federal deficits by about $250 billion annually, a whopping increase that would 
give almost any member of Congress the jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If CBO rules that the Clinton plan is on-budget, rather than off-budget, you 
can forget about the Clinton plan," said one White House economic policy-maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "A negative ruling for the Administration would certainly underscore the need 
for compromise, to say the least," said Henry Aaron, a health care analyst at 
the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much riding on the outcome, the CBO has come under almost constant 
lobbying from the Administration as well as its Republican critics. "The 
pressure is more intense right now than anything I have ever seen at CBO," said 
Rudy Penner, a former CBO director. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly, health care experts at the White House have been working closely with 
the CBO, providing the agency with data on the Administration proposal and 
trying to divine what they can about the CBO's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 At congressional hearings and public events over the last few weeks, CBO 
Director Robert Reischauer has been pumped for information and grilled by 
Republicans who want him to declare that Clinton's health insurance premium 
would be a tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be the most important decision that Reischauer and the CBO ever 
make," said Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 The White House argues that since the mandatory premium of 7.9% will be paid 
to private insurers, it is simply a substitute for existing premiums. The money 
isn't going into government coffers, and therefore is not a tax, Administration 
officials insist. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics counter that the premiums should be considered payroll taxes because 
Americans would have no choice about whether to pay them. They add that when 
Washington discovers it needs more money than anticipated to subsidize 
universal health care coverage for the poor and uninsured, politicians will 
certainly look to the premiums paid by middle-class workers as a ready source 
of funds to pay for the subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, if the premium is considered a tax, it would reasonably follow 
that the entire health alliance system should be considered part of the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are requiring that all employers provide health insurance, that 
could be declared a tax," said John Shiels, vice president of Lewin-VHI. "And 
if it is a tax, then arguably the plan should be in the federal budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts note that the ruling revolves around semantics and symbolism. But 
symbols can be powerful, especially if they change the way the nation thinks 
about an issue such as health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Semantic issues carry political weight," Aaron said. "Depending on how the 
tax issue comes out from CBO, the spin doctors will be whirling dervishes."

AFTER QUAKE, SCHOOLS LEARN TO DO WITHOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Algebra students at Monroe High School in the mid-San Fernando Valley used 
one-page work sheets last week because their soggy textbooks were worthless. 
Science students at the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies had textbooks 
but no Bunsen burners, beakers or microscopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of working with paints and clay in their damaged art building, 
seventh-graders at San Fernando Middle School were reduced to drawing with 
pencils in a chilly classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Los Angeles area, the story is the same. Nearly all schools 
have reopened, but the Jan. 17 earthquake left many campuses without enough 
textbooks, crayons, paper and equipment. Teachers and students are trying to 
make do, often in makeshift classrooms without heat and still shaking with 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers are redesigning their courses to compensate for damaged books and 
missing supplies, borrowing from each other and using their own money to 
acquire enough learning materials to get by. 
</P>
<P>
 "We beg, borrow and steal," said Cindy Keyser, a mathematics teacher at 
Monroe. "We'll take anything we can get our hands on. It's survival." 
</P>
<P>
 At many campuses, especially in the San Fernando Valley, faculty members 
returned to work to find the contents of filing cabinets, desks and closets 
strewn everywhere. Course materials collected over decades were destroyed by 
water from ruptured lines. Big-ticket features of the modern classroom -- 
computers, TVs and VCRs -- were destroyed over a wide area. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is particularly bad in the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
where money for supplies and materials has been dwindling for several years. In 
many schools, textbooks were years behind and equipment was in short supply 
before the quake. Many school officials say the campuses will replace lost or 
damaged items but that it will take time. 
</P>
<P>
 To help schools replenish their supplies and instructional materials, the 
district has allocated most campuses $5 per student. About 190 schools that 
were hardest hit with quake damage have been allocated $15 per student. 
Textbook money will come separately from grants the school district expects to 
receive from the federal government, but obtaining the books will take time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that this is going to have a devastating and long-term 
effect on our schools," said Henry Jones, the district's budget director. 
"There is money to recover some of the losses but some schools may have to 
start all over." 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be some time before schools return to where they were before the 
earthquake," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monroe High School in North Hills, 1,200 textbooks were destroyed when 
overhead pipes burst, sending three inches of water gushing through classrooms. 
The school lost its entire set of German texts and most English composition, 
math and world history books. Charts and posters were drenched and stacks of 
computer paper and copying paper were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cases, we couldn't afford to buy sufficient textbooks for all the 
math classes, so they shared," said Principal Joan Elam. "Now they can't share 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the school's buildings are also unusable. Auto shop students hunched 
over desks looking at work sheets rather than building race cars last week 
because the shop building was declared unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so boring," said Jasen Heggemeier, 17, a junior. "We can't do 
anything in here. We want to be working on our cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Werdon, the auto shop teacher, said he understands the students' feelings 
and would prefer being in the shop building. "It's just not the same," he said. 
"These kids really miss working with their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Across campus, students sat huddled in down jackets and parkas listening to a 
teacher who held the room's lone English textbook and wrote instructions on the 
chalkboard. Greg Messigian, Monroe's special education department chairman, 
said every English book was destroyed when the room was flooded. The room still 
has no heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part of all of this is the loss of books," Messigian said. "I 
have to do everything on the board. It slows the learning process. 
</P>
<P>
 One teacher, Patti Leppla, gave up on teaching English composition one day and 
tried to show a videotape called "The Incredible Human Machine." But the tape 
had gotten wet and was unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I think we'll have to do something else," she told her students. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southern California school districts also were hard hit by the quake. 
Television sets and computers were shaken off their stands in the Santa 
Monica-Malibu Unified School District. Though some materials were lost in the 
William S. Hart Union High School District in Santa Clarita, officials said 
they had been preparing for two years for an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that we really dodged a bullet here," said Gary Wexler, the 
district's curriculum director. "We had planned and prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 The district had secured its science laboratories, built special storage 
containers and cabinets and cleaned out shelves of old textbooks and supplies. 
As a result, the schools suffered only minor losses of science equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies in the Mid-Wilshire 
district lost most of its science materials. San Fernando Middle School science 
teachers do not know what is lost because they have not been allowed to enter 
their damaged classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying not to shortchange the kids, but science is a lab class and it's 
hard to do it in a non-lab situation," said Rick Marqusee, the science 
department chairman at San Fernando. "Teaching is more than just showing up for 
a class, lecturing and reading from a book. It's activities, pulling things off 
a shelf, working with things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The science teachers at San Fernando Middle School, usually a close-knit 
group, are now spread across the campus. One teaches in a mechanical arts room, 
another in a portable classroom and another in a cooking classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 None are doing lab work, and few have their supplies from the classrooms. 
"It's like living out of a suitcase: You can do it for a day or two, but after 
that the novelty has worn off and it becomes difficult -- you need more 
things," Marqusee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-grade art students at San Fernando worked last week in a dimly lit 
classroom without water. The students made pencil drawings of the earthquake, 
many showing faces with open mouths and others with burning houses. Some asked 
the teacher how they could show shaking beds and moving walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Louise Bache said she had been in her classroom for 25 years and now 
was unable to use the room. She is unsure how her collections of art books and 
videotapes made it through the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things that can't be replaced," she said. "We will just do things 
differently. We won't do any painting. No papier-mache projects and collages. 
It's hard to plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's social studies and English classroom building also is unusable, 
and those classes have been dispersed throughout the campus. Last week, three 
classes used the auditorium -- one on the stage and two in different parts of 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools have no gymnasiums for physical education classes because they 
are being used as Red Cross shelters. At Canoga Park High School, about 1,000 
people have been living in the gym. The outdoor basketball court has been 
turned into a parking lot -- with delivery trucks pulling in and out, and cars 
and pickup trucks lining the soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when it's all said and done, most schools lost a great deal," said 
Larry Higgins, principal of Canoga Park High. "It's going to be quite 
extensive. We won't know for a while what happened to our gym floor and soccer 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Audubon Middle School in the Crenshaw area lost books and computer equipment 
when two water lines burst. Volunteers -- including parents, bus drivers and 
clerical staff -- used hair dryers to try to salvage books. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Travis Kiel said he had just ordered new textbooks but they had not 
been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank goodness these brand new books hadn't gotten here," Kiel said. "As you 
picked up some of these books, they just fell apart in your hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take us a couple of years -- at least -- to recover," he said. "We 
will be using a lot of ditto sheets and copying chapters of books. Kids won't 
be able to take books home every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools are assessing the damage and will make reports to the district in the 
next few weeks. Most school officials say they still are discovering items 
missing or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day we realize something else we can't use," said Rosemary Enzer, 
principal of Danube Avenue Elementary School in Granada Hills. "But we're just 
trying to make do with what we have."

WILL BORDER BUILDUP BE EFFECTIVE?; IMMIGRATION: PATROL SAYS HUNDREDS MORE 
AGENTS, HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT WILL DETER ILLEGAL ENTRY. BUT HISTORY OF NEGLECT 
AND ABUSES TEMPER THE ENTHUSIASM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Border Patrol has long been regarded as the blue-collar underdog of 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents drive battered vehicles. Radios fail during pursuits. Lack of personnel 
in San Diego forces agents into tedious tasks such as interviewing lines of 
prisoners being returned to Tijuana -- often the same faces night after night. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to end the frustration and anarchy at the border, the immigration 
control initiative announced by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno last week will send 
unprecedented reinforcements to San Diego: a 40% increase in the 1,000-agent 
contingent combined with sorely needed new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "These physical improvements and the increase of agents will give us a 
considerable degree of control that we don't have now," said William T. Veal, 
deputy chief of the Border Patrol's San Diego sector. "Our end goal is 
deterrence. We achieve that by ensuring that anybody who tries to enter 
illegally will be caught." 
</P>
<P>
 The buildup will deter would-be illegal immigrants and redirect the flow away 
from a region that records half of all border arrests, Border Patrol commanders 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Less optimistic observers say the Clinton Administration acceded to only a 
moderate buildup in response to political pressure. "It's not enough," an 
immigration official said. "They are going to have to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 Memories of neglect temper the enthusiasm among agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's just kind of waiting and watching," said Border Patrol 
spokeswoman Ann Summers. "It's a big, big move in the right direction. As much 
as has been promised to us in the past, when we actually start seeing it is 
when we are going to see the highest morale." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has also renewed fears about the potential for abuse by an agency 
with a record of misconduct cases and allegations. For U.S. and Mexican migrant 
advocates, the acquittal in Arizona on Thursday of a Border Patrol agent who 
shot an unarmed suspect in the back served as an ironic counterpoint to the 
attorney general's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Justice Department officials intend to avoid the hiring rushes of the past 
that allowed dubiously qualified agents to slip through. Doris Meissner, the 
new commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, is emphasizing 
better screening, training and discipline, and creating a citizens advisory 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding past mistakes is crucial, according to experts. Although new 
resources will unquestionably worsen the odds for illegal crossers, the 
volatile confrontation at the international line will continue between a 
growing paramilitary police force on one side and determined migrants on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends not only on the number of the agents but on the mentality of the 
agents," said Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the Bi-National Center for Human 
Rights in Tijuana. "As crossing becomes more difficult, that makes people 
desperate. The irritation among the migrants is created not only by the 
presence of Border Patrol agents but by the smugglers, the presence of robber 
gangs. This mix creates tension." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year INS plan includes an already appropriated $45 million package for 
this year aimed at shutting down the main corridors of illegal immigration. The 
patrol will deploy 620 additional agents in San Diego and El Paso, which 
together recorded three-quarters of border arrests last year. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 400 San Diego agents -- including about 100 existing agents who 
will be relieved from support duties by new civilian workers -- will be divided 
among three border stations and a planned roving unit, Veal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last year's border blockade in El Paso, which fielded a massive show of 
force overnight, the increase in San Diego will unfold gradually as classes 
graduate from the patrol's academy. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that agents are properly equipped, the government will supply 200 
more vehicles in San Diego, improved infrared detection devices and motion 
sensors, and new radios designed to prevent eavesdropping by smugglers of drugs 
and immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the technology we've found on smugglers made us look like we were 
playing with toys," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fortification of The Line, as the boundary is known among agents, will 
accelerate. The patrol will build a second fence behind the existing 10-foot 
metal barrier on a barren stretch of terrain known as Otay Mesa, creating a 
50-yard-wide corridor in which agents can trap illegal crossers. High-intensity 
lights are being installed along the 14-mile strip of canyons and mesas. An 
existing mile of lights and double and triple fences have reduced crossings and 
violence along the Tijuana River. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, commanders also hope to eliminate one of the job's most 
curious and tedious rituals, in which agents must return to their stations to 
conduct brief interviews with dozens of weary captured migrants. After the 
paperwork is complete, the prisoners are then returned voluntarily to Tijuana, 
where many turn around and cross again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilingual civilian employees will take over routine processing duties, freeing 
agents to spend more time in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to have those forms filled out by civilians rather than Border Patrol 
agents," Veal said. "It's going to mean agents are used more effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 New computers will streamline paperwork. Commanders hope that an automated 
fingerprinting system will permit identification of all arrestees for the first 
time, providing records on arrest levels and repeat offenders after years of 
murky estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Border Patrol agents could conceivably capture and release a 
wanted murderer among the crush of immigrants because they do not always have 
the time or means to identify hardened lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift to the border could eventually curtail the operations of the San 
Clemente and Temecula freeway checkpoints, which employ about 170 agents. Those 
stations are coveted assignments because they provide opportunity for 
promotions and alternatives to the grueling work at The Line, but Commissioner 
Meissner told The Times that their value may decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll continue to have those checkpoints at the present time," she said. "But 
if we succeed in San Diego in the way we envision with this level of resources, 
there will be much more deterrence at the border because we'll be preventing 
entry, and we will then have to look again at whether those checkpoints really 
make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan works, arrests will rise and then decline as discouraged migrants 
give up or go elsewhere, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's naive enough to think it's going to cure the total problem of the 
border," said INS spokesman Duke Austin in Washington. "But as they move to 
other areas, the flow becomes more manageable." 
</P>
<P>
 The second year of the proposal would add another 390 agents to the patrol, 
pending congressional approval. In addition to border enforcement, the 
wide-ranging initiative would also expedite deportation of immigrants convicted 
of serious crimes, streamline the political asylum process, strengthen 
sanctions against employers of undocumented workers and promote citizenship for 
legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tijuana, however, many Mexicans believe that the forces of poverty and 
hunger will continue to drive illegal immigrants over any number of obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it difficult, but not impossible," said Clark, the human rights 
activist. "The ingenuity of the migrants and the talent of the smugglers surely 
will find a way." 
</P>
<P>
 Most illegal crossers will keep trying to sneak across from Tijuana because of 
the forbidding terrain of deserts and mountains to the east, Clark said. There 
have been predictions of harrowing tactics -- boat forays along California 
beaches and massive charges on Interstate 5. And it remains to be seen if 
increased competition will push smugglers to raise their prices, which have 
remained constant since the late 1980s, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 The get-tough policy has critics of the Border Patrol worried about the 
potential for violence. The agency has suffered from flawed screening, training 
and oversight that have caused scandals and controversies. Clearly aware of the 
patrol's spotty image, the Clinton Administration underscores the importance of 
internal scrutiny and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents are receiving additional civil rights and ethics training, Meissner 
said last week. To keep better track of potential problem agents, an internal 
watchdog unit in Washington is monitoring complaint patterns more closely. 
Personnel officials say they are speeding up woefully slow background 
investigations, which have remained incomplete long after agents were hired and 
allowed recruits with criminal records to take the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had problems in the past," Austin said. "We have made great strides. 
We can identify people who may be problems before they become entrenched." 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner has also created a nationwide civilian advisory panel that 
will begin functioning by the summer, Austin said. It will be made up of two 
Justice Department representatives and 13 volunteers to be appointed by 
Meissner. Unlike a civilian review board for the patrol proposed by Latino 
legislators, the advisory panel will have no investigative powers and will 
concentrate on improving community relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thinks there's a need for that type of input on the handling of 
complaints and in our own disciplinary actions and monitoring those actions," 
Austin said. "This will assist her in getting an external view."

DEBONAIR ACTOR JOSEPH COTTEN DIES AT 88; MOVIES: PERFORMER BEGAN HIS FILM 
CAREER IN THE 1941 CLASSIC 'CITIZEN KANE.' HE REMAINED DURABLE THROUGHOUT, 
MAKING NEARLY 60 MOTION PICTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph Cotten, the enduring, elegant actor whose four decades in movies began 
at the pinnacle of film lore with the classic "Citizen Kane" and ended less 
memorably with the stunning flop "Heaven's Gate," died Sunday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotten died of pneumonia at his Los Angeles home, said his business manager 
and lawyer, Hugh Robertson. Cotten's wife, actress Patricia Medina, was with 
him when he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor had suffered a debilitating stroke and heart attack in 1981, and 
fought for years to regain use of his well-known gravelly baritone voice. 
Troubled intermittently by throat nodules, he had his larynx removed in 1990 
because of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotten's earliest films were regarded as his best and his best-known, 
beginning with "Citizen Kane," Orson Welles' thinly veiled biography of William 
Randolph Hearst in 1941, in which Cotten played Kane's elderly best friend 
Jedediah Leland. To follow in the 1940s were memorable roles in "The 
Magnificent Ambersons," "Shadow of a Doubt," and "Portrait of Jenny" for which 
he won the 1950 Venice Film Festival prize for best actor. In 1950, he rejoined 
Welles the actor in the highly successful international thriller "The Third 
Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine was a heady beginning in the movies," Cotten wrote with understatement 
in his poorly received 1987 autobiography, "Joseph Cotten: Vanity Will Get You 
Somewhere." "We made a classic without knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of his film career, he realized a lifelong thrill in 
"Heaven's Gate" -- opening at Radio City Music Hall. But the irony of the 
failed film in 1982 was not lost on him, as he wrote in his book: "It was such 
a disaster that it closed the Music Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 But the dapper, debonair Cotten remained durable throughout, always finding 
work to support his robust appetites for clothes, travel, women, parties and 
elaborate homes in London, Los Angeles or Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The persisting core of Cotten's work has been an elegant and unobtrusive 
craftsmanship which emphasized the role that Cotten was playing rather than the 
fact that Cotten was playing it," Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin 
said at the time Cotten's book appeared. "Not often has an important Hollywood 
personality of Cotten's generation been so deferential to the material itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a tradition more British than American," Champlin wrote, "he has been the 
working actor: Have tux, will travel. He has done everything, from 'Petulia' to 
'The Abominable Dr. Phibes,' occasionally lending his particular dignity to 
some very thin texts indeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotten acted well with, and for, his young friend Welles, and even scripted 
their "Journey Into Fear" in 1942. His 1936 stage success in "Horse Eats Hat" 
with Welles for the Federal Theatre Project and his stage triumphs in Welles' 
Mercury Theater propelled Cotten's career. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, Cotten was nonplussed when Welles offered this early 
appraisal: 
</P>
<P>
 "You're very lucky to be tall and thin and have curly hair. You can also move 
about the stage without running into the furniture. But these are fringe 
assets, and I'm afraid you'll never make it as an actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as a star," Welles added, rekindling Cotten's sinking hopes for his 
future, "I think you well might hit the jackpot." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in the Virginia peanut center of Petersburg on May 15, 1905, "Jo" Cotten 
got his first job working for his father, the city superintendent of mails, 
distributing special delivery mail by bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the best pair of legs in the world," Cotten often recalled. "I pedaled 
a million miles if I pedaled a yard." 
</P>
<P>
 He did his first acting in high school, and after dropping out, set out to 
become an actor. He borrowed $150 from a banker uncle and went to Washington, 
D.C., to study for a year at the Robert Nugent Hickman School of Expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Hickman's voice lessons were valuable," he later wrote. "Beyond that, I 
learned that private acting instruction should be prohibited by law. . . . It 
is the audience who teaches (an actor) to act, and that can take place only in 
a theatre." 
</P>
<P>
 To support himself in Washington, Cotten sold vacuum cleaners, and on Sundays 
played semiprofessional football, earning $25 a period, and losing most of it 
playing craps. 
</P>
<P>
 He later went to New York, where he found work in a paint warehouse but failed 
to launch a theatrical career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the natural physical endurance of youth, with its blessed ignorance, 
its lofty arrogance and vanity strong enough to be mistaken for graciousness," 
he wrote decades later, "all actors would end their careers early." 
</P>
<P>
 Lured to Miami by a real estate boom in 1925, Cotten got a job as an 
advertising salesman for the Miami Herald at $35 a week, which allowed him 
evenings free to work in the Miami Civic Theatre. A lifelong epicure who 
enjoyed cooking as well as ordering from menus, he concocted the mayonnaise for 
something called Tip Top Potato Salad and marketed it, an enterprise that 
failed only when health authorities put him out of business for lack of a 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years in the Miami Civic Theatre, in which he unabashedly reviewed 
for the Herald plays in which he starred, a patron offered him a letter of 
introduction that sent him back to New York. He got theater impresario David 
Belasco to hire him as an assistant stage manager, and, while knocking on 
stars' doors to announce "Five minutes please," understudied Melvyn Douglas in 
"Tonight or Never." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotten did the role for Boston's Copley Theatre, where he stayed a season 
honing his craft in 30 plays. He also persuaded Lenore La Mont, a divorcee he 
had met in Miami, to come to Boston to play piano for the troupe. Cotten 
married La Mont, who had a small daughter, in Boston in the fall of 1931. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in New York and out of work again as the Depression set in, Cotten turned 
to modeling and acting in one-reel industrial films. He flunked intermittent 
screen tests but then met Welles at a radio audition. The two became fast 
friends when they were thrown out of a studio for laughing loudly at an actor's 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 When Welles went into the National Theatre Project, a Depression-era project 
for out-of-work theatrical people, Cotten followed. And when Welles and John 
Houseman set up their Mercury Theater in 1937 with the play "Julius Caesar," 
Cotten won an important role. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years with Mercury Theatre, and shortly before the radio version of 
Welles' group made history with "War of the Worlds," Cotten was cast opposite 
Katharine Hepburn in her stage triumph "The Philadelphia Story." 
</P>
<P>
 When that tour ended in 1940, Cary Grant got the role as leading man in the 
film version, but Cotten decided to try Hollywood anyway. He called Welles and 
soon found himself with a leading part in "Citizen Kane." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotten noted in his autobiography that for his film debut in a role many 
regard as the capstone as well as the wellspring of his career, he had to start 
filming with one day's notice. He got the final script at 7 p.m. and reported 
nine hours later for extensive makeup, at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Welles and anyone else with anything to do with "Citizen Kane," Cotten 
incurred the enduring wrath of newspaper magnate Hearst. Even when "Joseph 
Cotten" appeared above the title in subsequent films, the actor noted, Hearst 
papers reviewed the films without mentioning his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercury company broke up after "The Magnificent Ambersons" and "Journey 
Into Fear," both in 1942. The next year, Cotten made "Shadow of a Doubt," his 
favorite, and his first film for the independent producer David O. Selznick, 
who became an even stronger friend and supporter than Welles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving home from David's parties required no headlights," the bon vivant 
Cotten wrote with delight. "The sun had always risen." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to films, Cotten during the 1940s did a weekly Sunday CBS radio 
show called "Ceiling Zero" for Lockheed Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotten's first marriage suffered from his wife's claustrophobia and fear of 
traveling, as his career took him to locations throughout the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became unfaithful," he related in his generally saccharine autobiography. 
"It was very easy. I was a young, healthy, full-blooded American and had 
achieved a certain amount of fame, which, of course, made it easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was an actor. A roamer. A lover," he wrote. "I made pictures, I made love 
and I made martinis." 
</P>
<P>
 His philandering caused Lenore to attempt suicide at one point when she had 
sailed to join him in England during filming of "Under Capricorn," one of his 
two films for Alfred Hitchcock, which was released in 1949. She recovered, and 
Cotten, he later wrote, "discovered the true meaning of fidelity." She later 
died of leukemia in Rome when Cotten was working on the 1960 film "The Angel 
Wore Red." 
</P>
<P>
 After his wife's death, Cotten directed a play at the La Jolla Playhouse, and 
then retired to his garden to mourn. Among his callers was the actress Patricia 
Medina, who had been a friend of his wife's as well. He married her on the 
Selznicks' terrace in the fall of 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing his love of travel and conviviality, Medina performed in many touring 
plays and some films with Cotten, but generally subordinated her career to his. 
</P>
<P>
 They performed together in "Calculated Risk," which hit Broadway in 1962, just 
as the newspapers went on strike, preventing publication of the original 
review. Resurrecting his advertising expertise, Cotten set out to publicize the 
production on television commercials for soap or beer, always demanding his pay 
in air time to tout the play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time his name had appeared above the title on a Broadway 
marquee, he explained, and he was simply "too vain to close." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotten continued to make movies in the 1960s and '70s, totaling nearly 60 
films during his long career. Later forgettable films ranged from "The Last 
Sunset" to the Japanese "Latitude Zero" to "The Abominable Dr. Phibes." He had 
a cameo role in "Airport '77" and even happily appeared on television's "The 
Love Boat." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a lot of junk," he candidly told an interviewer in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone," he reflected matter-of-factly in his book, "flirts now and then 
with a little trash." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't care about the movies, really," he said in his 80s. "I was tall. I 
had curly hair. I could talk. It was easy to do."

WILSON CRIME SUMMIT TO HAVE HARD-LINE FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN and DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his advisers convinced that voter fear of crime will drive the election, 
Gov. Pete Wilson opens a two-day crime summit in Hollywood today that will be 
dominated by law-and-order advocates and crime victims, and light on voices for 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit, postponed last month because of the Northridge earthquake, will be 
held at the First Presbyterian Community Center, a 700-person hall usually 
reserved for Bible studies and receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The invitation-only event will begin with an early morning memorial for crime 
victims and will be weighted throughout with proponents of the "three strikes" 
movement that seeks to imprison habitual criminals for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Panels will include Marc Klaas, father of Polly Klaas, the Petaluma 
12-year-old whose abduction and murder fueled the latest wave of public outrage 
over crime, and Mike Reynolds, whose daughter was murdered in 1992 and who is 
the sponsor of the "three strikes and you're out" initiative proposed for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Salarno, founder of Justice for Murdered Victims, will be among the 
parents of slain children who will speak at the opening ceremony. Salarno has 
been active in anti-crime efforts since her daughter, Catina Rose, was murdered 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Public concern about crime is running high and Salarno hopes that in this 
election year the summit will add to pressure on lawmakers to approve more 
anti-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is starting to peak," Salarno said. "People have been crying out. 
They want public safety. They don't want to have to look over their shoulder. 
The timing is perfect. We've got to take advantage of the timing." 
</P>
<P>
 The cast of political leaders scheduled to attend includes Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren, Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco), and many other state legislators. Los Angeles County Sheriff 
Sherman Block and Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams will be there. In 
all, 5,000 invitations were sent. Organizers expect 1,200 people to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aides say the two-day talkfest is aimed at developing consensus on 
anti-crime legislation and focusing pressure on the Legislature to pass bills 
that in past years have been blocked by the Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every Californian has a fundamental right not to become a crime victim, not 
to live in fear," Wilson said, explaining his reason for convening the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those not invited are Wilson's Democratic challengers, Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. The governor's rivals 
say the summit will be little more than a campaign event. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Republicans screw up the economy, they turn to crime. It's a 
time-honored strategy," said Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager. "The 
economy is in terrible shape and (Wilson) doesn't want people focused on that." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, a Democrat, also was not invited. An aide to 
Wilson said Reno, the nation's top law enforcement official, was not asked to 
attend because the governor wanted to limit the event to state officials -- 
although one of the scheduled speakers is an assistant U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will be light on liberal voices. But the governor's office did make 
a late addition by inviting Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripston will appear on a panel with Reynolds, Rob Bonner, head of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration under President George Bush; Superior Court Judge 
Lois Haight, a Justice Department official in the Ronald Reagan Administration, 
and Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels, long active in law-and-order efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a small part of me that thinks by appearing I am playing into their 
hand," Ripston said. "But I am willing to take a chance. . . . It's important 
that somebody says: 'Wait, this ("three strikes" movement) isn't going to do 
what everybody says. It won't make people safer.' I'm hoping that I'll be the 
voice of reason." 
</P>
<P>
 The summit is being held at a time when the Legislature is rushing to pass 
anti-crime bills, and when major crime has fallen, down 3.8% in 1993 in 
California. Even though crime overall fell last year, homicide climbed 2.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real intensity," George Gorton, Wilson's campaign manager, said of 
the public's perception of crime. "I think it's (because of) the random nature 
of the violence and the unpredictability of the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing the location for the summit, Wilson took a cue from Brown, who 
held a highly publicized economic summit last year at the Biltmore Hotel. The 
summit is being held in Los Angeles to ensure television coverage in the 
state's biggest media market. Los Angeles television stations have no 
Sacramento-based reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, who is helping to organize the event for the governor, explained 
that Hollywood was selected as the summit site for symbolic reasons. It is, he 
noted, a district "struggling with a crime problem." The Presbyterian community 
center was chosen to show that "communities need to be involved" in the fight 
against crime, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's staff fretted about holding the summit so soon after the 
Northridge earthquake. But if Wilson had postponed it further, he would have 
run into a conflict with Brown's summit on education next week in San 
Francisco, and other scheduling problems in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very concerned about crime any way you look at it," Gorton said. 
Although the quake and its aftermath is a concern, voters "certainly have 
enough room to focus on both." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said that before the event was rescheduled, he checked with Los Angeles 
police to make certain the summit will not interfere with more pressing 
disaster-related duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake has caused some logistic problems. Federal disaster workers have 
taken up many hotel rooms in Hollywood, and some people scheduled to speak when 
the conference was set for January could not make it in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti is among those who was supposed to 
speak in January, but cannot attend today. Garcetti, an opponent of the "three 
strikes" initiative, will be at a crime conference in Washington, D.C., his 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the governor's invitation, Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris, 
who ran against Garcetti in 1992 and endorses the "three strikes" initiative, 
will be among the panelists. 
</P>
<P>
 Long active in crime victims organizations, Norris said he hopes that the 
summit will add to public outrage over crime, thereby putting more pressure on 
officials to pass and carry out tough anti-crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we enlist the public in the outrage against crime, we are not going to 
get anything done," Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit will include sessions on crime's impact on business, school 
violence, crimes against women and children, and juvenile crime. There is no 
scheduled discussion of the impact of increased incarceration on the state 
budget. The politically touchy issue of gun control will be addressed in the 
last panel, at 4 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Former San Jose Police Chief Joseph McNamara, an outspoken advocate of gun 
control, will be among the speakers on that panel. He is calling for higher 
taxes on guns, proficiency tests for anyone buying a gun, and state legislation 
allowing cities to pass their own gun ordinances. As it is, the state controls 
gun law -- and legislators rarely pass measures limiting access to firearms.

AZERBAIJANIS ON DEFENSIVE AS FIGHT INTENSIFIES IN KARABAKH; CAUCASUS: FIERCE 
RESISTANCE TO AN ARMENIAN ADVANCE IN THE DISPUTED ENCLAVE IS REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXIS ROWELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fighting has intensified in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, with 
Azerbaijani troops back on the defensive despite weeks of attempting to seize 
the initiative in the 6-year-old war with Armenian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interfax news agency reported over the weekend that Azerbaijani troops 
were "fiercely resisting" an advancing Armenian force in northern Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry said about 40 Armenians have been killed in 
the last few days. It did not report the Azerbaijani casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Azerbaijan's army had begun a large-scale offensive in mid-December after 
months of putting up little resistance to Armenian advances. The offensive 
aimed to recover some of the 20% of Azerbaijani territory that Armenian forces 
then controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the year, the warfare around Karabakh has escalated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Azerbaijanis have made small gains but lost "thousands" of troops in 
January, according to a senior international aid worker based on the 
Azerbaijani side of the front line. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable Azerbaijani success in January was the capture of the 
strategically important Morov Mountains and some villages to the south in the 
Kelbajar region between Armenia and Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may have been a costly victory: The operation claimed "more than 100" 
Azerbaijani lives, said Asad Issazade, an Azerbaijani Defense Ministry 
spokesman. And the supply lines to the area extend over a 9,000-foot-high 
mountain pass, a harsh journey in mid-winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Azerbaijanis have also recaptured the railway junction of Horadiz near the 
Azerbaijani-Iranian border. But the string of Azerbaijani towns outside 
Karabakh captured by the Armenians last year, including Agdam and Fizuli, 
remain out of Azerbaijani control. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Western diplomats in Baku believe that Azerbaijan's advance will soon run 
out of steam. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Armenians could then be in a position to inflict an even greater defeat 
upon the Azeris than they did last year," one senior European diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asim Mollazade of the opposition Azerbaijan Popular Front said last week that 
"the Armenians have already gone on the counteroffensive, but (Azerbaijani 
President Geidar) Aliyev does not want the people to know." 
</P>
<P>
 There is scarce reporting here of the heavy Azerbaijani losses because of 
strict censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 But funerals are increasing. New graves, draped with Azerbaijani flags, appear 
every day in the Martyrs' Cemetery outside Parliament in Baku. 
</P>
<P>
 In Yevlak, about 50 miles from the front, the men who make and erect 
tombstones were hard at work last week in the town's main cemetery. "That one 
went to the front on Friday and came here on Tuesday," said one gravedigger, 
pointing at a new tomb being covered with a layer of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Azerbaijanis know a high price is being paid. The general feeling here, 
however, is that the tide has turned and Aliyev's hard-line policies could win 
the Karabakh battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyev came to power last year after the military overthrow of his unpopular 
nationalist predecessor, Abulfez Elchibey. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraits and photos of Aliyev, the former Azerbaijan Communist Party leader, 
hang in virtually every shop window and office in Baku. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliyev has reportedly hired about 1,000 Afghan moujahedeen mercenaries to 
stiffen the backbone of the Azerbaijani army. Both sides also use mercenaries 
from the former Soviet armed forces, and some diaspora Armenians. 
</P>

 More than 15,000 people have been killed in the conflict over Karabakh, which 
erupted in 1988 after the ethnic Armenian majority there began a campaign for 
greater autonomy and the Azerbaijani authorities, backed by Soviet troops, 
tried to stamp it out.

OPPOSITION CANDIDATE WINS COSTA RICAN PRESIDENCY; ELECTIONS: HERO'S SON LEADS 
IN EARLY RETURNS, OVERCOMING SCANDAL IN A BITTER CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ending the most bitter election in modern Costa Rican history, voters Sunday 
chose as their next president the 39-year-old son of a national hero who had to 
overcome old murder allegations to stay in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition candidate Jose Maria Figueres appeared well on his way to defeating 
businessman Miguel Angel Rodriguez of the ruling Social Christian Unity Party, 
early returns showed. Rodriguez conceded Sunday night, pledging to heal the 
deep wounds opened by the acrimonious campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Electoral Tribunal released partial results that gave Figueres, 
trained at both West Point and Harvard, a slim victory margin of 2 to 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 "This triumph of the Costa Rican family is a triumph of truth over lies . . . 
of the teamwork of thousands over arrogance," Figueres told a jubilant crowd of 
supporters in downtown San Jose. "I hope we never again live through such a 
tumultuous campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Voting in this army-less traditional democracy was peaceful and festive. Costa 
Ricans loaded into their cars and filled the streets of San Jose and other 
cities, honking horns and waving banners with their party colors. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign, however, was a different matter. Scandals eclipsed issues, and 
the negative tone raised questions about just how democratic Costa Rica's 
famous democracy is. It left many Costa Ricans wondering whether their 
country's tradition of polite politics has been shattered forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueres, of the National Liberation Party, had to fight accusations that he 
participated in the 1973 death-squad murder of a two-bit drug dealer, an 
allegation he denies. Rodriguez was dogged by a 1982 U.S. indictment on charges 
he exported tainted meat to the United States; the charges were dropped, but 
his firm was fined. 
</P>
<P>
 Both campaigns made the most of these scandals, using the allegations in 
advertisements and stump speeches. Rodriguez warned that Figueres was a danger 
to the country, while Figueres called Rodriguez a liar with a "sick mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Rica has relied on a political system of consensus and compromise to 
remain Central America's most stable country, and the exchange of insults 
during the campaign will make it difficult for opposing parties to work 
together in the future, analysts here said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one candidate is calling his opponent a murderer, and the other is calling 
his opponent a swindler and a cattle thief, then how do you get beyond that?" 
asked a senior Costa Rican government official. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters Sunday also chose all 57 members of the National Assembly and dozens of 
city councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the campaign, Figueres capitalized on the name of his father, Jose 
(Don Pepe) Figueres, who led and won Costa Rica's 1948 civil war and is 
credited with founding the modern state. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Figueres abolished the army, instituted broad health and education 
reforms and built a social safety net that has enabled Costa Rica to avoid the 
war and abject poverty suffered by its Central American neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 While Figueres pledged to "modernize" the programs of his father, Rodriguez, a 
54-year-old economist trained at UC Berkeley, said he would accelerate the 
economic reforms of outgoing President Rafael Calderon, lowering tariffs to 
promote trade and encouraging privatization of select government enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueres' National Liberation Party has dominated Costa Rican politics since 
the civil war. Costa Rica did not officially have a two-party system until 
1984, when Calderon's Social Christian Unity Party was registered as an 
"institutional party," meaning it would automatically appear on ballots every 
election along with the National Liberation Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The domination of Costa Rican politics by two moderate parties has left little 
room for third parties and little room for serious dissent beyond a narrowly 
defined middle road, analysts here say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bi-party system has meant that democracy here has always been . . . an 
exercise in consensus -- an exercise in 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch 
yours,' " political analyst Luis Guillermo Solis said. "There are two forces 
that define all the rules of the game. That does not create a lively democracy. 
It may not destroy democracy, but it weakens it."

ISRAELI LOSES HEALTH REFORM, QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health Minister Chaim Ramon resigned Sunday after Labor Party apparatchiks 
blocked his attempt to reform Israel's health system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the Cabinet that I can no longer take responsibility for the health 
system," Ramon said on Israel Radio. The resignation, made in writing and read 
out by Ramon at the weekly Cabinet session, goes into effect Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon's proposal aimed at guaranteeing citizens basic medical services 
regardless of income or employment status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am obligated to the voter, to the public and also to myself," Ramon said. 
"If I did not do what I did today I would find it very hard to live with 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon's plan easily passed the first of its three required votes in 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cabinet withdrew the proposal last week after the Labor Party, the 
dominant partner in the coalition government, came under pressure from 
Histadrut, the trade union that represents about 60% of Israel's workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Histadrut owns the country's largest health care organization, which relies on 
government handouts to stay afloat. Most of Histadrut's officials are members 
of the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon's plan would have cut subsidies to such organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan called for Israelis to pay a health tax of 4.8% of their income. Many 
Israelis now pay a similar amount, an average of about $650 annually, to 
various health funds that run clinics and fund hospitalization in some cases. 
But the funds are not required to accept all applicants, and an estimated 
350,000 Israelis are uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 The demise of the health bill was seen as a personal defeat for Ramon, a 
leader of Labor's free market-oriented Young Turks, and a setback for efforts 
to reform still-dominant socialist holdovers from Zionism's early days, such as 
the Histadrut. 
</P>
<P>
 Commentators also said his stance might help him in the struggle to take over 
the party once the current generation of leaders retires.

AMERICAN ALBUM: IN DENVER, A REAL ESTATE MARKET THAT'S A MILE HIGH; BIDDING 
WARS, OFTEN WITH CALIFORNIA TRANSPLANTS, ARE PUSHING UP PRICES AS MUCH AS 2% A 
MONTH. 
</P>

 Andrea Green was emotionally spent after being outbid on a fourth home in this 
city's red-hot housing market. When she saw No. 5, she was determined to have 
it, no matter the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 After a five-minute inspection, Green and her agent hurriedly wrote an offer, 
wary of a competitor -- a woman who had also been aced out on house No. 4 the 
night before -- writing her own bid in a car parked outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Green clinched the deal the same afternoon last June, but she winces when 
asked how much more she paid than the asking price of $157,500 for the 1920s 
bungalow in Washington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like going through childbirth or something -- I've blocked the whole 
thing out of my mind, it was so painful," said the 32-year-old designer and 
sales manager for a small Denver clothing maker. "Here I was, offering $2,500 
over asking price!" 
</P>
<P>
 Read it and weep, homeowners in California, where once rock-solid real estate 
values have fallen an average of 5% statewide in two years -- and as much as 
30% in high-priced areas such as Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Denver region, homes are so sought after that prices have jumped 
sky-high over the same period. In the university town of Boulder, home values 
climbed 18% last year. In the rapidly gentrifying Washington Park area of 
southeast Denver, appraisers say bidding wars have pushed prices up 2% a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The market is so superheated in the Mile High City that real estate agents, 
inspectors and legions of home-repair workers are busy seven days a week. 
Prospective buyers rushing to advertised "open houses" are finding that nine 
out of 10 homes are already sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers, meanwhile, have become so cocky that many are routinely refusing to 
make basic repairs to close a deal -- things like golf-ball-size holes in 
roofs, old and frayed wiring, even water-damaged foundations. Dropping the 
price is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad for the buyer, because Buyer B is right behind you and is 
willing to take it that way," said Shelley Bridge, a Denver real estate agent 
who in 1993 had her best sales year in more than a dozen years in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver residents often blame the soaring prices on the influx of immigrants 
arriving in Colorado since 1991 -- including 33,000 Californians, many armed 
with bundles of cash from selling higher-priced homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, who moved from the San Francisco Bay Area three years ago, lost her 
first bid on a house to a Californian with cash in hand. House No. 4 went to a 
California couple that bid $5,500 over the $149,500 asking price for a 
three-bedroom, one-bath bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only part of the story, say real estate and regional economic 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that has really caused our market to explode is the existing 
resident who is selling, cashing out nice equities and buying back into the 
local housing market," said broker Duke Fyffe, who sold 100 homes with a total 
value of $16 million in 1993. "Because of low interest rates, they're getting a 
lot more house for the same monthly payment." 
</P>
<P>
 In certain areas, particularly the established tree-lined neighborhoods within 
minutes of downtown Denver, the demand for vintage homes far outstrips the 
supply. Which explains why some sellers are getting as many as five and six 
bids -- usually full price or more -- the day their "For Sale" signs go up. 
</P>
<P>
 For the losing bidders -- and their agents -- there are often bruised feelings 
and jangled nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was the most financially rewarding of her 14 years in the business, 
but broker Judy Wolfe said it was also the most taxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because of the pressure of knowing that every time you show a house 
these days, your buyer has no time to make rational decisions, no time to 
really look over a place," Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Carter has seen tough times at both ends. When her husband was 
transferred from California to Denver by his company in December, they sold 
their Contra Costa County home at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I hadn't been a real estate agent myself and my husband's company hadn't 
picked up closing costs at both ends," they would have lost much more, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctant to get stuck again, she searched for a home in the suburbs, offering 
below the asking price for a four-bedroom, three-bath home in Englewood, about 
15 minutes southeast of Denver. The seller snapped up the offer of almost 
$200,000 on the 15-year-old fixer-upper. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Carter is itching to get back in the real estate game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to tell you, it's nice to move into a hot market."

 DOWN MEMORY LANE: Military planners are looking to make the 50th anniversary 
of D-Day on June 6 even bigger than the 40th, when then-President Ronald Reagan 
played a starring role. Apart from an appearance by President Clinton, who will 
get a chance to parade as commander in chief, the early planning calls for a 
large-scale re-enactment of the Normandy landing that led to liberating Europe 
from the Nazis. . . . Planning for the 50th anniversary of V-J Day -- which 
marked victory over Japan on Sept. 2, 1945 -- is more complicated because of 
Japanese sensibilities. Trying to avoid friction, U.S. military historians have 
already traveled to Tokyo to confer with their Japanese counterparts. One 
potential problem: the National Air and Space Museum's plan to unveil in 1995 
the extensively restored Enola Gay -- the U.S. plane that dropped the atomic 
bomb on Hiroshima, killing tens of thousands and forcing Japan's surrender.

 TERMINAL TREND? The drive to limit House members to three two-year terms is 
being undercut by lawmakers stampeding toward the exits on their own. The 
number of incumbents announcing departures from the House continues to outpace 
even the record-setting 1992 cycle, when 65 voluntarily gave up their seats. So 
far, 36 incumbents have announced they will leave at the end of this session. . 
. . If the trend continues, less than half the people elected to the House this 
November will have more than three terms under their belt. Only two decades 
ago, nearly two-thirds of House members had served more than three terms.

 HIP TV: You might think that insomniacs, retirees and shut-ins are most of the 
people who watch C-SPAN, those two cable channels that televise House and 
Senate proceedings and other steamy fare. Think again. . . . A C-SPAN survey of 
1,400 viewers found that 77% are under 50 years old, and the largest group 
(40%) are in the 18-to-34 age group, the very people experts thought didn't 
care about public affairs. . . . During the last presidential campaign, 58 
million people tuned in at least once -- and 98% of them say they voted. Which 
explains why politicians actually claw for time on C-SPAN.

 STICKING AROUND: Here's one indication of who plans to be calling the shots as 
the Administration negotiates with Congress over health care reform. According 
to aides, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will travel only on Mondays and 
Fridays for the rest of the year. That way, she can be in Washington when 
Congress does its heaviest lifting, Tuesday through Thursday.

 YOU BE THE JUDGE: Just what is Bill Clinton -- Old Democrat, embracing liberal 
dogma, or New Democrat, practicing pragmatic moderation? Radically different 
answers can be found in new books from the far left and far right. . . . Author 
Norman Solomon spews disappointment over Clinton's New Democrat tendencies in 
"False Hope." "Amid all the talk of 'change,' routine economic brutality is 
undisturbed," he says. . . . But a distinctly contrary view is taken in a 
booklet mailed to subscribers of the conservative Human Events magazine. 
Spotlighting 26 people tapped for top jobs by the President, the publication's 
title is: "Clinton's Crazies: The Loony Left Is Alive and Well in the Clinton 
Administration." PAUL HOUSTON and ROBERT SHOGAN

15-YEAR-OLD IRAN REGIME HAS LITTLE TO CELEBRATE; MIDEAST: THE ECONOMY IS A 
SHAMBLES. BUT TEHRAN'S ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT IS SQUABBLING OVER FOREIGN VIDEOS, 
PORNOGRAPHY AND PROPER WOMEN'S CLOTHING.

<P>
 On the 15th anniversary of Iran's revolution, the austere Islamic republic has 
less to celebrate than at any time since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini forced the 
shah to abandon the legendary Peacock Throne, according to U.S. officials and 
Iran experts. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Khomeini's revolutionary regime faced its primary challenges from 
abroad: the war with Iraq, diplomatic isolation imposed by the United States, 
economic sanctions from the West, the disdain of the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Iran's problems are largely internal. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economy a shambles, the government is squabbling over such 
distractions as foreign videos, pornography and proper women's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no mortal, external threat to the revolution," said a Clinton 
Administration official who asked not to be named. "The greatest destruction is 
coming from within." 
</P>
<P>
 The mounting internal tension erupted during commemorations at Khomeini's tomb 
last week when five shots were fired in what Tehran radio later called an 
assassination attempt against President Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Iran has spurned repeated opportunities over the last year to take steps 
-- including improving diplomatic and trade relations with the West, 
particularly the United States -- that might help ease its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between Washington and Tehran have turned colder after what had 
looked like a thaw at the end of the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafsanjani's regime is believed to be well-aware of its plight. But for all 
its initial interest in repairing international relations, it has hesitated for 
fear of backlash at home. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rafsanjani was elected president after Khomeini's death in 1989, U.S. 
diplomats viewed him as a pragmatist who favored loosening Iran's strict 
Islamic rule politically, economically and socially. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, and again after the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when Iran remained neutral 
and then helped win release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon, Rafsanjani gave 
American officials grounds to hope for improved relations. 
</P>
<P>
 They expected him to move toward political, economic, social and diplomatic 
reforms after purging Khomeini's die-hard followers from Parliament in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hard-liners were, indeed, driven from office. But they were replaced by 
social conservatives who had little use for reforms. Rafsanjani's maneuvering 
room was further circumscribed last year by the narrow margin of his own 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts are now pessimistic that Rafsanjani's second term -- and his final 
one, under Iran's constitution -- will feature significant openings in either 
domestic or foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political base of the regime is now very narrow," said Shaul Bakhash, a 
professor at George Mason University in Virginia. "To keep this base happy, the 
regime must appear radical on international issues and Islamically correct on 
social issues like women's dress and Coca-Cola." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem faced by Rafsanjani is known in Tehran as the "Gorbachev 
syndrome" -- the land mines that await leaders who try to introduce a little 
reform into authoritarian countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev "made concessions that were intended to 
reform communism, not scrap it. But in the end he lost everything," said 
Geoffrey Kemp, a National Security Council staffer in the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. "Even Iranian pragmatists are afraid that, if they make 
concessions, reforms will never be enough and will instead open up a slippery 
slope. They're obsessed with fear that the whole idea of a modern Islamic 
republic will collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Iran's economy -- depleted by the prolonged war with Iraq, a birthrate that 
has nearly doubled the population in 15 years and rampant corruption and 
mismanagement -- is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation has reportedly reached almost 100% a year, while unemployment and 
underemployment are soaring. Middle-class workers, forced in the last five 
years to work second jobs to make ends meet, are now taking on third jobs. Up 
to two-thirds of Iranian factories run at limited capacity, with raw materials 
in chronic shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Iran's Majlis, or Parliament, passed laws to make Iran once 
again inviting for foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the new laws are even more favorable to foreigners than those 
in effect during the shah's Western-oriented regime, they have failed to lure 
significant outside interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the drop in world oil prices has led to an estimated 20% budget 
shortfall for the Islamic year ending in March, according to Iran's Oil 
Ministry. The resulting cash-flow problem has increased the difficulties of 
gaining access to the credit necessary to buy foreign consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic woes have, in turn, forced the government to propose reductions in 
subsidies for gasoline and other necessities -- moves criticized in both 
Parliament and the press and likely to hurt the regime's power base among the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 While the economy has collapsed, the Majlis, once the engine of revolutionary 
action, has passed no major legislation. Instead, tangential issues have 
dominated the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of a thriving black market in videos, for example, the Majlis last 
year finally allowed foreign videos. The government went into the business of 
dubbing movies in an attempt to control content, and it allowed the death 
penalty for repeated convictions for distributing pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 The Majlis came down hard when state-controlled Iranian television, which is 
run by the president's brother, tried to introduce more entertainment and 
foreign shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, it condemned Iranian television for showing "Billy Budd," a 
1962 film based on a Herman Melville novella about an 18th-Century seaman who 
is court-martialed for killing a sadistic master-at-arms. The criticism was 
based on the characterization of Budd as highly moral, even though he was 
implicitly illegitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all its problems, the regime still faces no internal opposition force 
capable of ousting it, American officials say. And the regime still likes to 
blame the United States for its woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, Rafsanjani declared that Washington had "lost the game" of 
trying to topple the Islamic republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been exposed to a very dangerous propaganda plot engineered by 
arrogant powers, particularly America," he said in a sermon at Tehran 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 But Iran is now "out of danger," he said. "We're in need of practically 
nothing with regard to defense. . . . Iran has reached a state of stability, 
and they can no longer do us harm." 
</P>
<P>
 But American policy has grown less intent on manipulating Iran, Administration 
officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the hostage period, we have come of age in a difficult area. We no 
longer believe we can play games inside the country to strengthen one wing or 
weaken another," an Iran analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is now pursuing a strategy of "enhanced containment," 
focusing only on the actions and policies that concern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notable are Iran's opposition to the Middle East peace process and its 
support of extremist groups, both Islamic and secular. 
</P>
<P>
 In accord with that strategy, the Administration has banned the sale to Iran 
of any goods that might have military uses. And Iranian goods may not be sold 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the door is not completely shut. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. oil companies are now the biggest buyers of Iranian oil. Since they can't 
bring it home, they sell it outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. exports to Iran -- consumer goods, oil equipment and other non-military 
material -- climbed from $60 million in 1989 to $750 million in 1992, according 
to the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, the Reagan Administration official, said the Clinton Administration had 
adopted "a realistic approach to Iran that calls for a dialogue. Iran has 
rejected that call. And it's highly unlikely that Tehran will be able to change 
its policy on that count anytime soon. It's a unique situation where we're so 
used to the United States not talking to people. Now it's the other way 
around."

AS IRE FADES, PEROT GROUP IS A SPOTLIGHT IN SEARCH OF A FOCUS; POLITICS: UNITED 
WE STAND PLANS TO ISSUE SCORE CARDS ON MIDTERM CANDIDATES. BUT WITH VOTER 
OPTIMISM ON THE RISE, THE TEXAS TYCOON MUST FIND A RALLYING POINT. 
</P>

 "Both political parties are doing everything they can to see that you'll go 
away," Ross Perot told leaders of United We Stand, America, Inc. as they 
gathered for their first national strategy session. "But we are not going to go 
away. We're going to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 But one central question remained unanswered when the meeting concluded 
Sunday: Can the organization Perot founded a year ago find a message strong and 
clear enough to stir voters in this fall's midterm election and fulfill the 
Texas billionaire's bright hopes for its future? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a formidable challenge. But Perot and his followers demonstrated in 1992 
that they can exceed conventional political expectations when they found a 
place on the ballot for his presidential candidacy and helped him get 20% of 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 United We Stand officials hope to match that achievement this year by 
following a blueprint released Sunday after three days of workshops and pep 
talks for the group's 100 state chairmen and directors, two from each state. 
</P>
<P>
 Banned from directly endorsing candidates for office because of its tax-exempt 
status, United We Stand will instead concentrate on informing voters of the 
views of office-seekers on 11 issues: a proposed balanced-budget amendment to 
the Constitution, campaign-finance reform, health care reform, the line-item 
veto, term limits, budget reform, congressional accountability, welfare reform, 
foreign lobbyists, government waste and education. 
</P>
<P>
 But to have any real effect on voters, the organization must overcome a number 
of obstacles, including a noticeable improvement in the mood of the American 
public since Perot entered national politics in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot was able to exploit voter distress about the recession and frustration 
with the gridlock that froze the Democratic Congress and the Republican 
President. Now the economy is surging, and Capitol Hill and the White House are 
bustling with activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perot is good at stirring up people about the failure of government to solve 
problems," Vanderbilt University political scientist Erwin Hargrove said. "But 
if the political system seems to be working and at least to be trying to 
address problems, he doesn't have much to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Still another problem for United We Stand is Perot himself. While the tycoon 
is the group's chief asset, providing not only the resources of his bank 
account but the celebrity of his name, the other side of the coin is that it 
still seems to be heavily influenced by Perot's personal inclinations and 
quirks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Perot is like the weather," said Russell Verney, a former Democratic 
Party state director who signed on with Perot to help develop issues. "It's not 
safe to predict what he is going to do until after he does it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the state leaders assembled here say that Perot's control of the 
organization is exaggerated. "The reason it's misunderstood is that people get 
their information from the media," said Dan Miller, a Los Angeles real estate 
operator who is United We Stand's state director for California. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair or not, the organization seems to be stuck with the public perception 
that Perot calls most of the shots. For that reason, its fortunes are heavily 
dependent on public perceptions of Perot, whose image took a battering after 
his performance last fall in a televised debate with Vice President Al Gore 
over the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the NAFTA debate showed Perot's weakness on facts and the pettiness 
of his personality," said George Shipley, a Democratic political consultant 
from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that Perot will drift into the Republican Party, taking his 
followers with him, in an effort to win the 1996 GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts speculate that Perot might seize upon the health care issue, as 
a substitute for NAFTA, to get juices flowing among the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the weekend meeting, Perot cited health care as a high priority for United 
We Stand, derided Clinton's plan and warmly praised Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), 
author of an alternative to the White House initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perot's inherent mistrust of any form of federal health care reform would 
have to be overcome before he would get behind any of the competing proposals 
now before Congress, including Cooper's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cooper's bill has been endorsed by the Business Roundtable, just 
the sort of economic power group Perot often inveighs against. 
</P>
<P>
 Another challenge for United We Stand, because it is limited to providing 
information about issues rather than nominating or endorsing candidates, is to 
find a niche for itself in a political system dominated by partisan loyalties 
and personality preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign battle plan for United We Stand "makes it sound something like 
the League of Women Voters," said Micah L. Sifry, editor of the Perot 
Periodical, a quarterly newsletter devoted to news of Perot and his movement. 
"If you are going to have a League of Women Voters agenda, you may just wind up 
with nothing more than League of Women Voters clout." 
</P>
<P>
 But United We Stand leaders say they can confound the skeptics by blazing a 
new trail. "We will follow our own pattern, making it as we go along," said 
Connie Smith, a state director. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the group decided to keep the size of its membership to itself, 
reportedly because a majority believed that whatever figure was released would 
detract attention from more serious concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is the number we should focus on," said Kentucky Chairwoman Debi 
Berberich as she pointed to a chart pegging the national debt at 
$4,522,736,000,000. "United We Stand America will be present until that number 
is zero."

SCIENCE SATELLITE RELEASE FAILS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second day in a row, NASA failed to release a science satellite from 
the space shuttle Discovery on Sunday and tried to salvage what little it could 
from the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground controllers raced against the clock to try to resolve the latest 
satellite problem: a malfunctioning guidance system.NASA said today would be 
its last opportunity to deploy the Wake Shield Facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wake Shield was supposed to fly free of the shuttle for two days so 
scientists could try to grow semiconductor films in the ultra-clean wake 
created by the saucer-shaped craft. There would be time for only one day of 
free flight if the satellite is deployed today. 
</P>
<P>
 As Discovery whizzed around Earth with the Wake Shield propped on the end of 
the shuttle's robot arm, Mission Control struggled to pinpoint the problem with 
the satellite's horizon sensor. The infrared sensor is supposed to help guide 
the satellite when it flies. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Discovery's six crew members were stymied by radio interference 
and glare from the sun. Those problems were resolved Sunday: Astronaut Jan 
Davis tilted the satellite on the end of the arm to eliminate the interference, 
and the crew used electronic signals, rather than status lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew was disappointed by the setbacks, especially astronaut Ronald Sega, 
who has spent years working on the Wake Shield. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, the first Russian to fly on a U.S. shuttle, had 
trained for more than a year to retrieve the satellite.

PRESIDENT'S HEALTH PLAN VS. RIVAL BACKED BY BUSINESS; LEGISLATION: REP. COOPER 
DRAWS ATTENTION WITH HIS ALTERNATIVE TO THE ADMINISTRATION BILL. BUT MANY ARE 
UNCLEAR ON HOW THE TWO PLANS DIFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Propelled into the spotlight by powerful interest groups, Rep. Jim Cooper's 
formula for national health care reform is now being hailed as the leading 
alternative to President Clinton's proposal for improving the way Americans 
receive medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents praise it as the sensible middle ground between radical tinkering 
and doing nothing. Critics deride it as a business-oriented scheme to shift 
health care costs onto middle-class workers and predict that its appeal will 
evaporate under closer scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 But the overriding fact about the Cooper plan -- written by the Tennessee 
Democrat and Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) -- is that almost no one outside the 
health care industry has more than the haziest impression of what it would do 
and how it would do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the plan, for example, offer greater freedom of choice for consumers? 
Would it assure universal coverage? Would it avoid large bureaucracies making 
what ultimately are highly personal decisions about the medical care of 
thousands of individuals and families? 
</P>
<P>
 It is easier to tell what the Cooper plan would not do: Unlike the Clinton 
formula, it would not require businesses to provide health benefits for their 
workers, and it would not impose government cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
 It was for these reasons that the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce and the National Assn. of Manufacturers came out against the Clinton 
plan last week. The Roundtable, composed of the heads of 225 large 
corporations, and the Chamber of Commerce endorsed the Cooper plan, the 
Roundtable calling it a good "starting point" for the health reform debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cooper bill, said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), one of the President's chief 
conservative detractors, is "Clinton with a smile." Not so, said Sen. Thomas A. 
Daschle (D-S.D.), a Clinton ally who derides the Cooper measure as "health care 
that is barely there." 
</P>
<P>
 Both plans spring from the same premise: that consumers, by banding together 
in large groups, can gain more clout in the health care marketplace and force 
quality up and prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end they both would create huge cooperatives that would purchase 
health care -- whether from health maintenance organizations, more informal 
networks of doctors or doctors working on a traditional fee-for-service basis 
-- for most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how Cooper's bill diverges from the Clinton plan: 
</P>
<P>
 Who Is Covered? 
</P>
<P>
 Because it does not require anyone to buy health insurance, Cooper's bill 
falls short of what the President has said is his bottom line: guaranteed 
coverage for every American. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's reasons for wanting to bring everyone into the system are more 
than humanitarian. Many health economists argue that it is impossible to bring 
costs under control until everyone is covered by the same system, because the 
uninsured will continue to receive care at the expense of everyone else. In 
principle, it is like trying to put a family on a budget while leaving one 
relative a credit card to use without limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper insists that the difference between his approach and the President's is 
semantic. Once the obstacles that prevent many Americans from affording 
insurance are removed, Cooper says, "there is no reason why everyone won't be 
covered. If there are some, we will soon know who they are and be able to cover 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 What Benefits Do They Get? 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan spells out a list of guaranteed health benefits that the White 
House says are similar to those offered by most major corporations. Critics 
warn that Congress would be tempted to embellish Clinton's formula. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper claims his approach will take the politics out of the process by 
establishing a commission to decide which benefits would be covered in all 
health insurance plans. Congress would be allowed to accept or reject the 
package, but not to amend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Would Have to Join Health Purchasing Groups? 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cooper would not require all employers to provide health benefits for 
their workers, those that do and have 100 or fewer employees -- in other words, 
those that employ about half the U.S. labor force -- would have to buy benefits 
through a state-chartered alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives say they are worried that forcing businesses into purchasing 
alliances would dampen competition. Many firms, they say, would do better if 
left to provide their own health coverage -- as many large companies do now and 
would continue to do under either the Cooper or Clinton plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton would force even more companies into government-organized purchasing 
groups. His proposal calls for those firms with fewer than 1,000 workers -- or 
those employing more than 70% of the work force -- to purchase coverage through 
alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 How Are Costs Contained? 
</P>
<P>
 Both plans say competition will do most of the work in keeping health costs 
under control, but both add other incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan would put limits on health premiums -- a thinly disguised 
price-control mechanism. Critics point to history as evidence that this is 
bound to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's plan turns to the tax code, allowing employers to deduct from their 
taxable income only the cost of the cheapest plan in their area. Employers 
could offer more, but the incremental costs would not be deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it is wrong for the taxpayer to continue subsidizing fully loaded 
"Cadillac" health plans when 37 million Americans do not have even a 
stripped-down Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) says the Cooper proposal would 
encourage employers to offer their workers only bare-bones coverage. "People 
are going to be losing what they already have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses also object to losing some of their tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Cooper's plan would break new ground by allowing individuals 
to deduct their full share of the cost of the cheapest health-care option 
offered by their alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 What Happens to Medicare and Medicaid? 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper and Clinton would leave Medicare, the government program that finances 
health care for the elderly, intact. But Medicaid, the joint federal-state 
program for the poor, would be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicaid's acute-care benefits would disappear under both plans, which would 
integrate the poor into the same purchasing cooperatives that would serve other 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan would leave Medicaid's long-term care unchanged, with the 
federal government and the states roughly splitting the bill. Cooper's plan, by 
contrast, would gradually put the entire burden for long-term care on the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 This provision in the Cooper plan is generating deep concern among the 
nation's governors. Gov. Pete Wilson warns that California, which now pays 
about half of Medicaid's $2.4 billion a year in long-term care costs, would 
face "a bottomless pit." 
</P>
<P>
 What About Those Who Cannot Afford Coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan, while it would require businesses to spend up to 7.9% of 
their payrolls on health care for their workers, would provide subsidies for 
those businesses with fewer than 75 workers and average wages of less than 
$24,000. Those subsidies would reduce the effective cost to as low as 3.5% of 
payroll for firms with fewer than 25 employees who earned less than $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also would require most individuals to pay about 20% of their health 
care costs, up to 3.9% of their income. But those earning less than 150% of the 
poverty level would be eligible for subsidies that, for the very poorest, would 
reduce their contribution to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government defines a family of four earning less than $14,764 as 
living in poverty; thus, those earning $22,146 or less would be eligible for 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper targets all subsidies toward individuals, with those earning up to 200% 
of the poverty level eligible.

GIFTS OF GAB AT THE TIFFANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIDGET BYRNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lobby of the Tiffany Theatre was abuzz with animated, opinionated, 
interruptive talk at the reception following the invitational premiere of David 
Mamet's play "Oleanna" on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that everyone was trying to ape Mamet's way with words in his 
controversial take on the politics of sexual harassment. The crowd was 
friendlier than that, with no overt signs of war between the sexes. But, as 
producer Paula Holt pointed out: "People always find themselves talking about 
the content of this play, not about the set or who they sat next to, though 
actually somebody did tell me how excited they were to find themselves sitting 
next to David Hockney." 
</P>
<P>
 There had been controversy offstage as well. The production moved from the 
Mark Taper Forum after Taper officials objected to casting Lionel Mark Smith as 
the professor accused by a student of sexual misconduct in the two-character 
play. Smith, who is black, says he believes that the decision was racist, which 
the Taper denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Those congratulating the night's stars -- Smith and Kyra Sedgwick -- and 
exchanging industry gossip over wine, coffee and hors d'oeuvres included 
Sedgwick's husband, Kevin Bacon (Bacon's skinhead appearance was due to his 
role in the film "Murder in the First" in which he plays a prisoner in 
Alcatraz); Bud Cort; Corky Hale and her husband, Mike Stoller, and Gene Davis, 
who is working with Hale on a documentary about pioneering black actress Hattie 
McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 Also there was Jim Curley, excited that there is talk of a sequel to "In the 
Line of Fire," in which he played the lackluster President saved from the 
assassin's bullet by Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a bit of a knot in my stomach watching the end of this play because 
Kyra could get hurt, but I love watching her act. I'd like to watch her act 365 
days a year. It's one of the great things she does, and she's great at a lot of 
things," Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had trouble applauding that young lady because I wanted to give that little 
broad she played a punch in the stomach," said Esther Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams went on to recall how she used to cope with sexual harassment. "Being 
athletic and a champion and taller than them" helped her to keep many men in 
their place, Williams said. "Louie B. Mayer used to shout at me, which is a 
type of harassment, so one day I said, 'Don't yell at me.' He said, 'I yell at 
everybody.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And I said, 'You can't get to the end of the pool first. If you got in the 
water with me, you'd sink.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He went quiet and he never yelled at me again."

MIDDLE CLASS BETWEEN A SHOCK AND A HARD PLACE; EARTHQUAKE: MANY EARN TOO MUCH 
TO RECEIVE GRANTS, YET ARE TOO DEEP IN DEBT TO ASSUME A GOVERNMENT LOAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One day Lynn Solky was a taxpaying citizen who ran a travel agency and shared 
a condominium with her husband in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day she was a homeless woman with a damaged business. 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of San Fernando Valley residents, Solky's life came tumbling 
apart when the Northridge earthquake shook the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated and bitter, Solky says that she has yet to hear from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and that she has been unable to borrow against the 
equity in her condemned condo to make a down payment on a new house for 
herself, her husband and her elderly parents, whose apartment complex also was 
trashed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "What annoys me is that people in the mainstream who work, who pay taxes, who 
are in the system are not getting help," Solky said. "We support the system, 
why can't the system support us now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Solky and other quake victims, who describe themselves as middle class, say 
they are being forced to rebound from the disaster by applying for federal 
loans they cannot afford to pile on top of existing debts such as mortgages and 
car payments and their kids' college tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, last month's quake threw barely comfortable lifestyles into a 
tailspin. And they will only begin to recover if and when they get financial 
assistance to replace lost possessions and repair their damaged homes or 
finance new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top 20% of the population has enough money to take care of their problems 
and the bottom 20% gets help from the government," said Richard Close, 
president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., whose community was 
particularly hard hit by the quake. "It's the 60% in the middle that nobody is 
addressing." 
</P>
<P>
 This scenario has angered some Valley residents who say the government relief 
system punishes the middle class by serving only the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Bolton, a demographer at the UCLA Business Forecast Project, is not 
surprised that middle-class victims are resentful about the degree of aid -- or 
lack thereof -- being offered to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our taxes go to help people in need and now they are the people in 
need," Bolton said. "There is a very large sense of disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it is likely that the bulk of the federal dollars will be used to 
rebuild infrastructure and provide emergency food and shelter, Bolton wonders 
how well the middle class will rebound from its quake-induced losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they have experienced is an extreme loss of wealth," Bolton said. "That 
certainly is a problem for the victims, some of whom won't be able to replace 
what took them years to build up." 
</P>
<P>
 In Lake View Terrace, Rick Olguin ponders his fate as he stands among a 
lifetime collection of rare Victorian paintings, about 50 of which were ruined 
when they fell off the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Olguin, an amputee, stood in a FEMA line on a prosthesis and his left leg for 
two hours, only to be told that he and his wife do not qualify for a grant 
because they earn too much money. 
</P>
<P>
 But after using his last $250 to pay a plumber to fix their quake-damaged 
pipes, Olguin says he is too poor to take out a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a state of shock when they told me," Olguin said. "We're 
middle-class, tax-paying, law-abiding citizens, but we're not poor enough for 
FEMA." 
</P>
<P>
 Olguin's disenchantment was echoed by David Gray, a Valley traffic officer, 
whose Simi Valley home also suffered quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so mad at this government," Gray said. "We're supposed to feel good about 
the government loaning us money?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's wife, Suzanne, said she was told by FEMA workers that she and her 
husband do not qualify for a grant and that they should apply for a 
low-interest Small Business Administration loan to repair their home and 
replace their lost possessions. They estimate that the bill could be as much as 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them we are house-poor," Suzanne said. "All of our money goes into 
our house and we don't have money to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Already saddled with mortgage payments and college fees for their two sons, 
Gray said the quake may foil his plans to retire from the Los Angeles Police 
Department in three years. He fears that he will no longer be able to "enjoy 
the fruits of life I had earned." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like every middle-class person, we live right up to our means. . . . You're 
always struggling," Gray said. "Now I'm going to go deeper and deeper into 
debt. We're all going to slip a little further back." 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA spokeswoman Rita Kepner said confusion persists over who qualifies for 
aid from her agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much how much money you make, as it is what kind of damage you 
suffered," Kepner said. "This is an emergency disaster program, not a 
commercial insurance program. We are a program intended for urgent and 
necessary needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims displaced by the quake qualify for temporary housing regardless of 
income, but the length of time that the housing will be provided will vary for 
victims depending upon their needs, Kepner said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA grants also may be available for low-income victims who suffered real 
estate damage or property losses but who have limited ability to repay a loan, 
said SBA spokesman Rick Jenkins. For example, an unmarried applicant who earns 
less than $10,455 annually may qualify for a FEMA grant, as could a family of 
four that earns less than $17,938 each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners, renters and business owners who exceed the income limits, and who 
SBA processors determine have a good ability to repay a loan, are directed to 
apply for an SBA loan, Jenkins said. Those can be as much as $200,000 for real 
estate damage and up to $40,000 for personal property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of people will come to SBA because we are the government's 
primary form of long-term recovery," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is that alternative that frustrates quake victims such as the Olguins, 
who live paycheck to paycheck and have little or no savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if you are poor, middle class or wealthy: If you don't have 
it, you just don't have it," Charlotte Olguin said. "To me, that's the bottom 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 Solky said she, her husband and her parents are staying with their son in 
North Hollywood until they can obtain financing for a new home that they plan 
to share. Solky and other owners at her condominium complex plan to jointly 
apply for a $1-million loan to repair their building, but more immediately, she 
needs a source of funds so she can make a down payment on a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not asking for food stamps or free housing," Solky said. "We're 
looking for assistance so that we can stay in the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless quake victims receive restructured home loans and favorable treatment 
from FEMA and lending institutions, they may be unable to absorb "the financial 
aftershock of the Jan. 17 quake," said Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners group President Richard Close pondered the quake's effect on his 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The middle class for most of the south Valley is made up of people who used 
to have a lot of equity in their houses," he said. "On Jan. 17, a lot of that 
equity disappeared, so they may not be middle class any more." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, possibly the most serious effect of the Northridge quake may be 
the shock waves into the future, Close said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before the earthquake, there was the perception that the middle class 
was going to move out of the Valley," he said. "Whether this is going to 
precipitate that move, I don't know."

BUT, SERIOUSLY...; HUMORIST ART BUCHWALD EXORCISES HIS DEMONS WITH TALES OF 
PAIN AND LONELINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY RIVENBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has lampooned politicians, chased goats through the mountains of Yugoslavia 
and engaged in lawyer-to-lawyer combat with a movie studio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, humorist Art Buchwald is joining the celebrity confession circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Leaving Home" -- his first serious book -- the 68-year-old newspaper 
columnist reveals the dark forces behind his comic vision: a mother who was 
sent to a sanitarium shortly after his birth (and whom he never visited in the 
35 years she lived there before her death); a childhood foray into "hell and 
damnation" Christianity; two bouts with severe depression as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 He also admits to shoplifting from a Woolworth store at age 11 and tormenting 
a poodle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfinished business," a barefoot Buchwald says during a recent book-tour 
interview in his suite at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. "Putting it down 
on paper . . . has freed me from all of these demons." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, it's hard to imagine the cigar-puffing, smiling Buchwald as a 
man plagued by demons. His twice-weekly humor column is syndicated in about 550 
newspapers (including The Times), he hangs out with a pantheon of Washington 
and Hollywood glitterati, and he seems to have a comic perspective on almost 
everything.  
</P>
<P>
 As featured speaker at USC graduation ceremonies last spring, for example, he 
advised future doctors to "get as much malpractice insurance as you possibly 
can (because) for every student finishing medical school today, there are two 
students graduating from the law school dying to sue you." 
</P>
<P>
 But Buchwald says the humor is a mask. 
</P>
<P>
 In the autobiography, which has received favorable reviews, he tries to take 
that mask off. 
</P>
<P>
 Before, when someone asked about his mother, "I lied. I said she died when I 
was born." In the book, he reveals that she was institutionalized for severe 
chronic depression and paranoia -- and that he never saw her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a child, they would not let me visit," he writes. "When I grew up, 
I didn't want to. I preferred the mother I had invented to the one I would find 
in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 He also saw little of his father. "Pop," an Austrian-born drape installer 
struggling to make a living in the Depression, shuffled young Buchwald and his 
three sisters off to a series of orphanages and foster homes before reuniting 
the family 15 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first stops was a Seventh-day Adventist boardinghouse. Buchwald, 
whose family was Jewish, says the talk of demons and the strict dietary rules 
there caused nightmares even years after he left. 
</P>
<P>
 In psychoanalysis as an adult, he concluded that "somebody had been messing 
around with my head during those early years and they left footprints on my 
brain. . . . To this day, I can't eat fish with scales on them. . . . There is 
still a tiny Seventh-day Adventist inside of me screaming to get out every time 
I make a pass at a tuna sandwich." 
</P>
<P>
 About age 7, bumped from one foster family to the next and feeling lonely and 
confused, Buchwald decided: "This stinks. I'm going to become a humorist." He 
adopted the role of class clown and set about doing everything he could to make 
people laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Until now, you've done almost nothing but humor -- 29 books, 
thousands of columns. What was it like writing this? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It became much more than just a book. It was therapy, catharsis and an 
educational experience. I found out I'd spent my whole life believing things 
that weren't necessarily accurate. My sisters' memories of certain events are 
entirely different from mine.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about the book now that it's done? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Pretty good. A humorist has to be taken seriously before he's considered a 
real writer. This is the first thing people have taken me seriously on. . . . 
I'm prouder of this book than (of) anything else I've written because I think 
it's the most honest stuff I've ever done.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long do you plan to continue the humor column, then? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'll keep going for some time. . . . (But) I've reached the stage where I 
don't need any of this to make a living anymore. And once that happens, you 
become a lot freer to do what you want. One of the liberating things about 
writing the book is that now, every once in a while, very rarely, I'll write a 
serious column.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you wish you had done this book earlier? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think I would have been able to, psychologically. I don't think I 
would have been ready to expose myself.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the book's revelations seem suitable for afternoon talk shows. 
Buchwald tells of losing his virginity at 15 to a hotel chambermaid and 
describes after-school masturbation sessions with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 He also discloses that he was hospitalized twice for depression -- in 1963 and 
1987 -- and that he felt suicidal both times, but he avoids detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was triggered by something happening in my life, but I didn't want to go 
into it," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchwald, who says he still sees a psychiatrist on occasion, likens the 
depression episodes to "speeded-up therapy. . . . You never completely get past 
it, but once you go through it and come out of it, you're a much better person 
and a much better writer." 
</P>
<P>
 Such true confessions apparently have struck a chord with readers. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people are fearful of talking about their lives," Buchwald says. 
"Something like this gives them permission to tell their own stories. One woman 
said she gave the book to her father and when he finished it, he told her (for 
the first time), 'I was an orphan, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He says several hundred letters have piled up in his Washington office since 
the book came out in mid-January. Many share experiences similar to the woman 
and her orphan father. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of "Leaving Home" is so grim. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Buchwald runs away to join the Marines, which he considers the best 
foster family he ever had, the tone turns more optimistic. The corps gets "full 
credit for straightening me out," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, he attended USC (where he now offers a scholarship to the 
"most irreverent" journalism student) and then headed for France, hoping to 
follow in the footsteps of Hemingway and Fitzgerald. The book ends with 
Buchwald hired as food and wine critic for the European edition of the New York 
Herald-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, there's a sequel in the works. It will cover his 14 years in Paris, 
where he won note for such reporting stunts as Yugoslavian goat chasing and a 
three-week limousine trip behind the Iron Curtain to show communists what a 
"bloated, plutocratic capitalist really looked like." 
</P>
<P>
 For Buchwald, humor became "salvation," the antidote to an unhappy childhood.  
</P>
<P>
 "People ask what I am really trying to do with humor," he writes. "The answer 
is, 'I'm getting even.' . . . For me, being funny is the best revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think humor has changed in recent years? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My standard answer to that is, I couldn't care less. I know what I do and 
it's accepted pretty well. . . . And one of the reasons I'm in such good shape 
is (that) there's very little competition. Dave Barry writes once a week, and 
there's Erma Bombeck, but it's not like in other sections of the newspaper 
where young sportswriters are coming up trying to push the old sportswriters 
out the window. There's none of that in humor columns. . . . And I think it's 
because editors don't encourage humor.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why? Are they afraid? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I wish it were only that. I think they simply don't understand it.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your impression of newer comics and humorists? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't understand a lot of the humor of the young, and I guess I shouldn't 
at my age. . . . I took my grandchildren to see ("Wayne's World") and I didn't 
get it. They understood it, so I guess some people find that funny. All I do is 
fight to keep what I do funny.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you see your work? What do you think you've accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think people feel better reading one of my columns than they do reading 
about nuclear waste in Tennessee.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any plans to write for Hollywood again? (In 1990, a judge ruled that 
Paramount Pictures had stolen Buchwald's idea for what became the Eddie Murphy 
film "Coming to America," and later awarded Buchwald and a partner $900,000. 
Paramount has appealed the ruling.)  
</P>
<P>
 A: No.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have any taboo subjects? 
</P>
<P>
 A: AIDS. I tend to be very gun-shy about anything to do with death. I'll 
probably write about the (recent) earthquake, but I won't do it soon.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Buchwald admits to something of a fascination with death. "For a humorist, 
I think (about it) a lot," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more so lately. Separated from his wife, Ann, and contemplating his 
own mortality, Buchwald clearly seems anxious to come to terms with his past 
and sum up his life and work with "Leaving Home" and its sequel: "I like a 
little tennis and I like to play chess, but now that time is running out in 
terms of things I want to do, I'm pretty much at the computer."

THE HUMAN CONDITION: WHY WE'RE CAMERA-SHY; FLINCHING AT EVERY SHOT; WE GO 
RIGID. WE GRIT OUR TEETH -- AND SMILE . AND THROUGH IT ALL, WE JUST KNOW WE 
LOOK AWFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This probably happened to you just recently: You were at a family gathering, 
chatting up Grandma or Uncle Merl.  
</P>
<P>
 You were enjoying yourself when, without warning, somebody called out: "Scoot 
closer together!" Suddenly, you were staring into the pitiless black eye of 
posterity. The photographer fiddled with the focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Smile, for heaven's sake. You have such a nice smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to be a good sport, you bared your teeth. But looking into the lens, 
you felt like a deer caught in headlights. And just as your intrepid 
photographer depressed the shutter button, you flinched. 
</P>
<P>
 Why?  
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if this was the first time somebody had taken your picture. You've 
had cameras aimed at you since you were a few hours old, cone-headed and 
squinty. 
</P>
<P>
 So why do we hate to have our picture taken? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because we know that the infamous flinching photo -- complete with 
uncombed hair, spinach between the teeth and those devilishly red "camera 
flash" eyes -- will end up in a scrapbook, right next to a snapshot of the 
holiday ham. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we know that the camera strips us of charm, leaving the unvarnished fact 
of our faces, our imperfect bodies, on heavy sheets of color paper. Leaving us 
to count flaws at our leisure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people never get used to the startling reality that they don't look like 
they think they look," says Kelly McAlister, a 33-year-old biochemist and 
former actress, who had to learn to stare the camera down. "Our faces aren't 
symmetrical like models, but that's what we compare ourselves to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At this point in the story, we usually introduce a psychologist to tell you 
this is all in your head. Not this time. Instead, please meet Lt. Verne King of 
the Los Angeles Police Department, who says there may be something to this fear 
of photos thing -- especially if police are behind the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 King has watched hundreds flinch for the camera, from gang members on the 
street to the newly arrested, posing for a mug shot. In this case, they fear 
the camera mostly because they know someone could recognize their pictures, 
King says. Sometimes their concern is well-founded. 
</P>
<P>
 King's favorite story involves a robbery suspect and a photo lineup. A couple 
years ago, King asked a jailer to assemble a lineup of the suspect and five 
other men, then take a picture so King could show it to the victim for 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you know how these lineups are supposed to be fair and everyone looking 
somewhat alike?" King says. "This jailer took my suspect and put him under a 
spotlight, facing straight ahead. Then he lined up three guys on either side of 
him and had all of them turned and facing my suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I couldn't use it, but it was funny. I had it hanging up in my 
cubicle." 
</P>
<P>
 The photo stayed there until one day when King was interviewing another 
robbery victim at his desk. She looked at the picture. She looked again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then she points at one of the other guys in the lineup, one who was looking 
at my suspect, and she says, 'That's him. That's the guy who robbed me!' And 
sure enough, it was. We convicted him," King says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. photographer Ann Summa's favorite stories involve the Very Powerful and 
Well-Known who end up on the wrong side of her Hasselblad. Almost all of them 
-- business tycoons, rock stars and artists -- squirm. 
</P>
<P>
 Since getting subjects to relax can be a full-time job, Summa has learned the 
art of chatting. She laughs easily. 
</P>
<P>
 But even old friends fear Summa once she's picked up her camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Groening, creator of "The Simpsons," and Summa have been friends for 15 
years, ever since they both worked at an alternative weekly newspaper. They 
visit each other's homes, go to the same parties. They are usually happy to see 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Summa says that when she shows up at Groening's office -- lugging a 
backdrop, lights, camera equipment and an assistant for publicity shots -- the 
smile drops from his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last time, I think he groaned," Summa says. 
</P>
<P>
 Summa understands her friends' reactions. She doesn't particularly like having 
a camera trained on her either. Why do you think they call it shooting ?  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's hard for most people to be the center of that kind of attention. 
It makes them self-conscious to be focused on," Summa says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Academia has actually studied this recoiling we do. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, USC professor T. Shelley Duval, of the Psychology and 
Human Behavior Department, concocted a study that would be considered 
nightmarish by photophobes. 
</P>
<P>
 Duval took two groups of 20 people and set them about a particular task. One 
group was allowed to work unmolested. The others performed while photographers 
recorded their every move. Not surprisingly, Duval found that mood and 
self-esteem plummeted in the photographed group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Photographs really cause us to focus on the gap between the true self and the 
idealized self," Duval says. "It makes us overly self-conscious. And 
self-consciousness is a bummer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I'm convinced there is an uncharted gene somewhere in the DNA 
strand labeled "photogenic." 
</P>
<P>
 There must be. Think of the people you know who don't try but still look good 
on film. Somehow, they catch the right light, always have a perky tilt to their 
chins. 
</P>
<P>
 My three sisters are like that -- the older one in particular. She can wear a 
bulky sweater and paint-stained overalls and, seen in person, you think, 
"There's a person in a sweater and overalls." 
</P>
<P>
 But take a picture. The Venetian red and gold paint splashes become . . . 
cosmetic. She never flinches. And she doesn't seem to mind the presence of a 
camera. She got the gene; I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe in a survival-of-the-fittest scenario, this could be bad. Think 
of how important photographs are today. Far-away relatives may know us only on 
film. We are remembered by how we looked on a certain day. And with the 
strangely continuing popularity of video-dating, some people pick -- or discard 
-- future mates based on celluloid. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't look good on film, you could end up in the slush pile. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's probably paranoid. And any good photographer will tell you that 
paranoia is the worst thing you can take with you in front of a camera. Your 
attitude becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy: You get nervous, you flinch. You 
flinch, you look bad. You think you're unphotogenic and the next time, you make 
that face again. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional photographers will tell you that the least photogenic people are 
those who believe that they look terrible in pictures. It is our vanity that 
derails our faces, makes us flinch and count the flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The best subjects, photographers say, are the people who look past the camera 
-- relate to the person instead of the awful black box they hold in front of 
their faces. Super models know this, and they get a lot of money for it. Maybe 
we can learn from them.  
</P>
<P>
 So, the next time somebody aims a camera at me, I'm going to forget it's 
there. I will blithely ignore its presence, and when the photographer's finger 
is making its final plunge onto that little black button . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, hell, I'll probably flinch.

CULTURE WATCH; ARE '60S ACTIVISTS HAPPY AT LAST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How are middle-aged '60s activists faring? 
</P>
<P>
 Female former activists are happier and more successful than non-activist 
women or male former activists, according to a study in the Journal of 
Personality and Social Psychology by Williams College and Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
 The study included 116 people -- 46 of them activists -- who came of age in 
the mid-1960s. They were interviewed at ages 31 and 41: 
</P>
<P>
 * Male former activists had lower-paying jobs, often in public service, than 
non-activist men or female activists. They were the least happy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Female activists protested for the rights of everyone -- women, blacks, the 
poor, draft resisters. Men often took on a personal cause against the Vietnam 
War draft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Both fought traditional wife/mother and soldier/provider roles. But society 
changed more to accept women in the workplace than to accept non-traditional 
men. KATHLEEN DOHENY

RELAXATION TECHNIQUES FOR THE SHUTTER-SHY

<TEXT>
<P>
 So you hate to be photographed?  
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few tips from professional photographers on how you can get over 
your fears and see better results on film. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loosen up before the first shot is taken. Do anything you can to keep from 
going rigid: rub your arms, rub your face. Take deep breaths and blow out 
vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ignore the camera. If you can, make it invisible and relate to the 
photographer, not the box. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not practice your smile beforehand. A practiced smile is a phony smile. 
The camera can see the difference.

 * Allow the photographer -- amateur or no -- to take a lot of pictures. This 
way, the best ones can be chosen and the rest can be trashed.

<P>
 * If it's a long photo session, insist on getting up and moving around. Shake 
your limbs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Change body position, even if only slightly: drop your shoulder, move you 
legs.

<P>
 * Convince yourself that this is fun. You can do that, the same way you 
convinced yourself you look bad. EMILY ADAMS

CAREERS; SHIFTING GEARS; THE SHIFTING WORLD OF WORK; EXPERTS SAY FLEXIBILITY, 
CUTTING-EDGE SKILLS ARE THE BEST DEFENSE AGAINST 'WORK-QUAKE' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who survived the 6.6-magnitude temblor that rocked Los Angeles last 
month, author Richard Nelson Bolles has another term sure to illicit shudders 
from job-seekers: "work-quake." 
</P>
<P>
 What? That's right. Just as the plates beneath the earth's surface 
periodically realign themselves, the underpinnings of our career landscapes are 
profoundly and unalterably shifting as well. Most "downsized" jobs aren't 
coming back. Many lost employee benefits aren't returning. And many skills that 
were in demand for the last 30 years are no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as scary as all that sounds, experts advise us not to panic. Instead, 
they urge workers to continually learn new skills, to remain flexible and to 
move toward jobs in growing industries rather than get trapped in a business 
heading toward extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Following are the views of six experts on what these shifts mean and how we 
can best avoid being trapped by them.

 Edward Lazear 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Fellow, Hoover Institution 
</P>
<P>
 Professor of Economics and Human Resources, Stanford University Graduate 
School of Business 
</P>
<P>
 The most important trend in the coming years is the globalization of trade, 
Lazear says. 
</P>
<P>
 With growing competition from abroad, American employers will place a premium 
on highly educated workers with strong information processing and analytical 
skills. At the same time, manufacturing jobs will radically change as 
production and assembly work continues to move offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than simply making huge quantities of widgets, blue-collar workers will 
increasingly be asked to solve production problems, such as creating optimal 
inventory controls. To do this, blue-collar workers will increasingly be forced 
to use information technology and to expand their experience to include 
organization and marketing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Lazear predicted, "production workers will be wearing white shirts 
and ties."

 Al Osborne 
</P>
<P>
 Professor of Business Economics, UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management 
</P>
<P>
 Director, UCLA Entrepreneurial Studies Center 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important ability that anyone can have is the ability to think," 
said Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it sounds simple, even too simple. But Osborne argues too many people 
are held back by outdated notions of how their lives should be ordered and the 
ways information should be processed. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne says new social and economic orders are being forged as the result of 
advances in communications and information processing that will encourage 
non-traditional forms of working, such as telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Even seemingly conventional jobs will change, Osborne says. Nursing will 
continue to be an important profession but, instead of working in hospitals, 
nurses will be involved more in home health care. And they will need to stay 
abreast of advancements in technology that are transforming the way medical 
care is delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Other institutions and their jobs are changing, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be willing to do different jobs; work in a team," Osborne advised. "Think in 
ways that are different." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Richard Nelson Bolles 
</P>
<P>
 Author, "What Color is Your Parachute?" 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about trying to figure out what the hot industries are and where most 
jobs will be created, Bolles advises. Better to decide what your skills are and 
where your interests lie, and then determine which careers fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to be a teacher, but can't find traditional teaching jobs? Try corporate 
education programs. "Broaden your net a little bit, look in non-traditional 
places," Bolles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if firmly entrenched in a career, continue to talk to others in related 
fields. There's no such thing as job security anymore, he says, so always be 
ready to move quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you are among the growing legion of temporary workers, get used to it, 
Bolles says. Temporary workers receive about 30% less pay and usually have no 
benefits, but short-term assignments can lead to full-time jobs. However, 
landing that full-time job will mean working harder, doing better work and 
showing more enthusiasm than existing full-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most successful careerist of the '90s is the person who recognizes the 
shakiness of the job market and always has alternative ways of going about the 
job hunt." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Bill Charland 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Fellow, Center for the New West 
</P>
<P>
 It's the dawn of the era of the techno-professional, Charland says, a blurring 
of the line that once strictly separated blue-collar workers from white-collar 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers will be looking more for skills than pedigrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees demonstrating abilities in many areas, such as design and production 
engineering, technology management and hands-on production skills, will be most 
marketable. The key, Charland said, is "combining technical skills with 
business management." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean you have to spend the next 10 years getting an MBA and an 
electrical engineering degree? Not at all, Charland says. In fact, he believes 
degrees have been oversold. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to stay close to the skills we feel comfortable with and move out 
from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, if you're a production worker, try to learn more about, say, 
international business and marketing. If you're a white-collar type, become 
conversant with the production process.

 Marilyn Moats Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
 Publisher, Kennedy's Career Strategist, monthly newsletter on career planning 
</P>
<P>
 Want a fulfilling, lucrative career in this cutthroat job market? Try a little 
personal initiative and creative thinking, says Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 That means looking at social and economic trends and finding ways to satisfy 
consumers' changing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because professionals and working women have less free time than they once 
had, start a house-cleaning service. Recycling is gaining popularity, but think 
about more than just bottles and cans. What about collectibles from the 1960s? 
</P>
<P>
 That advice also applies when you work for someone else, Kennedy says. Sell 
yourself as a set of skills, a creative-minded individual who can accomplish 
certain goals. Look ahead and propose new projects and ways to divide your 
time. Don't just be a carpenter; be a carpenter who can also do plumbing and 
electrical work. 
</P>

<P>
 Ron Krannich 
</P>
<P>
 Author/publisher, Impact Publishing 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming decade, Krannich predicts, we'll continue to see more corporate 
downsizing and increasing numbers of mid-career people being forced out of 
jobs. At the same time, we'll see more contingent and part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
 To cope, Krannich advises workers of any age and at any stage of their careers 
to learn one new skill a year. Adopt a hobby that could also be a marketable 
skill. Take advantage of corporate or community college training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, Krannich says, technical skills are what people will need most 
to compete. If you don't know anything about computers, now is the time to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Krannich also counsels workers to be ready to move. California is no longer 
the promised land. States such as Utah, Colorado, Arizona and Florida have the 
highest demand for new workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, retirement will increasingly be a moving target, he notes, with 
workers who end their careers at one company returning to the work force as 
consultants, trouble-shooters and part-time workers.

CAREERS; SHIFTING GEARS; THE NEW GLOBE-TROTTERS; TREND TOWARD INTERNATIONAL 
COMMERCE IS BRIGHT SPOT ON HORIZON FOR CAREER-SEEKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hopeful that the explosion of international trade will generate job 
opportunities, an unprecedented number of students and workers are seeking 
careers in multinational business. 
</P>
<P>
 The logic, especially in California, is compelling. An estimated 10% to 15% of 
California's economy -- representing about 1.5 million jobs -- is tied to 
international commerce, said Stephen Levy, the economist who heads the Center 
for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 And trade is one of the fastest growing sectors of the state's otherwise 
stagnant economy. The value of all international trade into and out of 
California climbed fourfold from 1979 through 1992, to $192.4 billion, 
according to the California World Trade Commission. Exports of goods produced 
in California doubled in five years, to $68 billion in 1992 from $34 billion in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Products made in the United States are very competitive in price and quality 
today," explained Richard Drobnick, director of the International Business 
Education & Research Program at USC's Graduate School of Business 
Administration. And with the U.S. economy recovering very slowly, he added, 
companies are saying "go over there and sell it overseas because you're not 
selling it in Alabama." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, globalization is one of the great business trends of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has happened pre-NAFTA," Drobnick said. With approval last year of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, a renegotiated General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade and an emerging Pacific trade zone, the volume of 
international commerce and its importance to both the U.S. and California 
economies are expected to expand.  
</P>
<P>
 The prospect that business globalization will generate new and better jobs 
draws business people such as Peter Guyer to programs like Drobnick's. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Pomona College in international relations, Guyer, 32, 
had worked in Bangkok and at American import-export firms for 10 years before 
returning to USC for his MBA degree. 
</P>
<P>
 This was his calculus: "American companies in general are awakening to the 
fact that they must operate in an international arena. That's a given if they 
want to grow and be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Already equipped with overseas experience and language skills -- he speaks 
Japanese and is studying Korean -- Guyer figured the USC program's 
internationally oriented MBA would give him "the tools to build my career and 
operate in this environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing numbers of USC business students are making similar choices. Drobnick 
says courses that include trips to Japan and Europe are oversubscribed. 
Enrollment is up dramatically in non-credit, evening language classes. A new 
"Dean's International Fellows Program" includes study and internships abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Guyer's investment in an international MBA paid off. He's now manager for the 
Asia Pacific area at Nestle Foreign Trade Co. in Glendale, figuring out how to 
sell Quik, Nestea and other U.S.-produced Nestle products in South Korea, 
Japan, China and other Asian nations.  
</P>
<P>
 "I understood that a company like Nestle -- a very global company -- would be 
able to use my skills, both in my current job and in future jobs," said Guyer, 
who anticipates a career with many overseas stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch-owned Nestle may not typify American companies when it comes to 
global-mindedness, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their talk of needing "global managers," international awareness 
remains an afterthought for many U.S. companies, and some of their most worldly 
workers are demoralized victims of an "Americentric" glass ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous amount of lip service -- and very little action to back 
up any part of it," said Hal B. Gregersen, a professor of organizational 
behavior at Brigham Young University and co-author of "Global Assignments," a 
book about working overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Research by Gregersen and his colleagues shows that fewer than 5% of big U.S. 
companies consider an employee's international experience in making overseas 
assignments, instead looking for workers with the technical expertise to solve 
immediate problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically a fire drill," he says: "We have a problem now in Kuala Lumpur 
or wherever it may be. Who's going to put out that fire as quickly as they 
can?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is only after they land abroad that many of these workers realize how 
little they know about the culture of the country where they are supposed to be 
solving problems or how big a handicap the lack of language skills can be.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, their careers often slide into out-of-sight, out-of-mind limbo, 
Gregersen said. In one study he helped conduct, half of the senior-level 
executives who returned home -- whether to a U.S., Japanese or European firm -- 
after assignments abroad had no idea what their next job in the company would 
be. Half were demoted. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, many who see international opportunities in their future will have to 
work on faith. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Mark Huffman, 34, did when he left USC's international program 
last August to take an unpaid internship at the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service 
office in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Guyer, Huffman had overseas experience -- a decade with Nixdorf computers 
in Germany and Asia. With a computer science degree from UC Santa Cruz, he had 
the technical skills. And he had connections: He met the chief U.S. commercial 
officer in Sydney at a USC conference, leading to the internship, which has 
turned into a paid job doing market research work for the Commerce Department 
while he secures an Australian work permit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffman still hasn't landed the management or technical consulting job he 
wants, which has led him lately to compare his life and career to those of 
former classmates who followed more conventional paths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot more experiences than any of these people," he muses. "They 
have condos, real nice cars. A lot of them are married and have children. . . . 
You begin wondering: What are the real trade-offs? That's the issue I'm 
wrestling with right now."

CAREERS; SHIFTING GEARS; INTERACTIVE PROMISED LAND; THERE ARE FEW CAREERS NOW 
IN MULTIMEDIA, BUT GROWTH IS COMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Meet Paul Drexler, antique dealer turned comedy writer turned corporate 
scriptwriter turned software marketer. And Chris Lathrop, video director and 
producer turned pay-TV executive. And Tim Bigoness, TV production assistant 
turned high-tech publicist. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their disparate career paths, Drexler, Lathrop and Bigoness have 
converged on common ground: interactive multimedia, the hot new industry that 
merges pictures, sound, graphics and text, and has enlivened the market for 
video games, educational computer software and corporate presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 The field of interactive multimedia is suddenly all the rage, attracting such 
high-powered types as fallen Wall Street maven Michael Milken, an investor in 
multimedia start-ups, and Hollywood's Strauss Zelnick, who left as president of 
20th Century Fox Film Corp. to head a small video game company. 
</P>
<P>
 All the hype about interactivity and free-flowing digital data on the 
Information Superhighway makes multimedia sound like the career for the 1990s 
and beyond. But keep in mind that the hubbub has been way out of proportion 
with the fledgling industry's size. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've been bitten by the multimedia bug and wonder whether you have the 
right credentials, here's a dose of reality: Getting a job won't be easy, or 
especially lucrative, unless you're one of those rare people with computer 
skills, creativity, vision and experience. On the other hand, there is broad 
agreement that the industry is poised for a hiring boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia is "exciting and fun," but at the moment it's "like a TV job -- 
everybody wants one but there are not a lot to go around," said Bigoness 
(pronounced Bee-jho-nay), vice president of marketing at Morph's Outpost, a 
multimedia magazine in Orinda, Calif. (The industry does have its rewards: He 
spoke by phone from Cannes, where he was attending a multimedia conference.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relatively small market right now," said Bruce Ryon, multimedia 
analyst at Dataquest Inc., a San Jose research firm. Even so, he added, it's 
packed with potential, as the public embraces CD-ROMs, the compact discs that 
come loaded with video and sound to make interactivity possible on computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that 2.4 million systems with multimedia capabilities were shipped in 
the United States last year, up from 700,000 the year before. Dataquest 
projects shipments of three million this year and 30% annual growth for the 
next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the computers shipped for home use this year will have CD-ROM drives, and 
by 1998, practically all machines are expected to come equipped with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some giant companies -- including Paramount, Viacom, Microsoft and 
Apple -- have started multimedia divisions, the industry is mostly concentrated 
in cottage ventures with fewer than five employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-growing players in California include Compton's NewMedia of Carlsbad; 
Electronic Arts in San Mateo, and Knowledge Adventure in La Crescenta. The 
staff at Compton's, which produces an interactive encyclopedia, has doubled 
every year for the last three years and now numbers 200. Electronic Arts, which 
has several top-selling sports and game titles, has grown to 1,050 from 450 
workers two years ago. Both companies expect to boost staff by 10% to 20% this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the work to develop and produce multimedia titles is being done on a 
contract basis. Especially in demand for full-time and contract work are 
experienced content developers: graphic artists, writers, animators and 
producers. There is also a big need for contract programmers, who earn $60 to 
$70 an hour. (Very "hot" programmers and producers can make as much as $80,000 
a year, but salaries of $40,000 or less are typical.) 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a foot in the door of any company, large or small, is tricky. The 
industry requires long hours and high energy, so it's no surprise that most of 
its practitioners are well shy of 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for people who were successful in traditional media and want to 
work for half as much," said Bing Gordon, a co-founder of Electronic Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 For newcomers, professionals advise taking classes to learn the language of 
multimedia and the dizzying scope of an interactivity project. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs are sprouting at universities such as USC and UCLA and at the 
American Film Institute. At San Francisco State University's extension, a 
multimedia program that started with two classes 18 months ago enrolled more 
than 900 students last semester. And in the first week of the most recent 
sign-up period, 452 students snapped up classes in interactive filmmaking, 
writing for multimedia and 3-D.  
</P>
<P>
 At USC, Apple Computer, Viacom and Warner Bros. joined to establish the 
four-month-old Entertainment Technology Center to train the multimedia experts 
of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 With advantages like that, you're certainly more likely to find a home in 
multimedia in California than if you lived in, say, Alabama. California has 
three thriving multimedia incubators -- San Francisco, (known as Multimedia 
Gulch); Los Angeles, with its Hollywood connection, and northern San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Drexler, the former antique dealer, got started in multimedia thanks to a 
contract with Apple Computer that led to a stint in the computing pioneer's 
multimedia lab. Three years ago, he started InterWorks with his wife, Julie 
Marsh, a veteran video producer and director. 
</P>
<P>
 From two offices in their San Francisco home equipped with five computers and 
some audio equipment, they are developing children's interactive fairy tales, 
with occasional coaching from their twin 5-year-old daughters, Lily and 
Michelle. Drexler and Marsh are scouting out investors: Developing and 
publishing a title can cost $300,000 or more.

CAREERS; SHIFTING GEARS; INTERACTIVE PROMISED LAND; CRUISING INFORMATION 
SUPERHIGHWAY WON'T BE A WALK IN THE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's going to take a lot more than a pick and shovel to build the information 
superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers who want to join what is touted as the next great economic boom will 
need high-tech skills in everything from computers to electronics -- not to 
mention such old-fashioned creative talent as knowing how to recognize a good 
story or having an artistic eye. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the early consensus among employers involved in the initial stages of 
the interactive television business. But these executives caution that because 
the technology of the information highway is still evolving, it is difficult to 
know exactly the kinds of jobs that will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers don't even have real names or titles yet for the kinds of workers 
they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Green, president of Denver-based Cable Labs, the technology research 
consortium of the cable TV industry, says cable TV operators and telephone 
companies building the information superhighway are looking for people who are 
"flexible enough to have a foot in the computer business, know about 
networking, telecommunications, cable and consumer electronics." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the jobs will be in the so-called computer-collar class developing the 
software and programming that will flow over the fiber-optic pipeline into 
homes. But there will also be jobs at the hardware end of the information 
superhighway -- literally laying the fiber-optic foundation, installing and 
maintaining the sophisticated equipment, and running the complicated 
transmission systems. 
</P>
<P>
 As cable TV systems around the country begin offering services that have 
historically been provided by telephone companies, cable operators will be 
looking for technicians who understand operating systems and can write the 
software to run them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable companies "are looking for highly technically trained employees, 
possibly coming from (the) aerospace industry, but also Bell Labs, the regional 
Bell companies, AT&T Long Lines, McGaw Cellular, MCI," said Bruce Gillman, vice 
president of human resources at Viacom Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Technicians, who know how to deploy fiber-optics and understand digital as 
well as analog transmission systems, will be needed. There will also be a 
demand for engineers and managers who can make the technology "customer 
friendly" and enticing to consumers. Because the cost of bringing the 
fiber-optic lines into homes is three to four times more expensive than 
traditional telephone or cable service, people with the marketing savvy to 
wring more dollars out of customers will be particularly prized. 
</P>
<P>
 One area where the skill base is already high -- and getting higher -- is on 
the software side. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset, interactive media was dominated by people with computer 
backgrounds, but this is no longer the case. Increasingly, it attracts people 
with more traditional skills -- writers, producers, graphic designers.  
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the shift in skills is turning up at the training grounds for the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Extension is offering a new curriculum, "Multimedia and Digital 
Technologies," where students can take classes in the game paradigm and 
interactive communications, and virtual reality. The American Film Institute 
inaugurated classes on interactive design. New York University offers a 
graduate program in interactive telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the aspiring multimedia producer in the not-too-distant future is 
going to have to be as knowledgeable about arcane topics such as cross platform 
interactive multimedia and optical storage as they are about what agent to call 
for the next hot writer or up-and-coming director. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom New Media, for example, has hired 100 people in the past year and is 
looking to add 50 more. The Viacom Inc. unit develops interactive games for the 
CD-ROM market, but one day such programming is expected to be delivered over 
cable or telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 It can take more than a year to develop a single CD-ROM title with a team of 
eight to 12 people. They include writers, computer programmers, graphic 
artists, game designers, interface developers and beta testers -- not typical 
of the people found on a Hollywood set.

 "This is not just imitative," said Michele DiLorenzo, vice president of Viacom 
New Media. "We are combining animation, video, writing, graphics, and combining 
it in some way to come up with a new experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the programming for the information superhighway is being developed by 
small computer-game companies that have been pioneering interactive media for 
several years. And that is where many of the new jobs are expected to 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 ActiVision, a Los Angeles-based video game producer, placed an ad in a 
Hollywood trade magazine a few months ago announcing that it was looking for 
"producers, programmers, artists and technologists." The company got more than 
400 responses. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Industrial Light & Magic in San Rafael, the company famous for 
creating the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park," recently hired 100 new employees and 
trained them in the use of high-tech computers to create special effects and 
animation. 
</P>
<P>
 So where do people learn the skills they need to produce, say, interactive 
programming? Tom Williams, who oversees digital production at Industrial Light 
& Magic, said he goes to multimedia industry conventions, such as SIGGRAPH held 
every summer in Anaheim, to recruit potential employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also notes that technical knowledge -- the ability to work with a 
computer, for example -- is not as valuable sometimes as innate talent. ILM 
hires many artists to help design special effects, and Williams notes that the 
necessary training can be done in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment is not the only area in which interactive producers will be 
needed. Education and home shopping programming, which some experts believe 
will be major components of the information superhighway, will employ growing 
numbers of producers and designers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest demands will be for artists who can work at computer work 
stations creating the software for the programming that, for example, would 
show a sweater from a clothes catalogue in every style and color and from every 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such projects can be as technically impressive as a NASA shuttle 
launch, they are years away from resulting in meaningful employment 
opportunities, cautioned Steven Koltai, senior vice president at Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury is still very much still out as to what is going to be entertaining 
to the consumer," he said. "We've had an interactive video business for six 
years and in the pay-per-view business, the lion's share of the (business) 
history has been (for pro) wrestling."

CAREERS; SHIFTING GEARS; CHANGING OF THE GUARD; DIVERSITY IN CORPORATE AMERICA 
HAS WHITE MALES FEELING LEFT OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When Douglas Tennant, an electrical engineer, applied for a job at Pacific Gas 
& Electric, the company would only offer him work as a long-term independent 
contractor, not as a full-fledged employee.  
</P>
<P>
 "Informally, they told me that . . . what openings they had would most likely 
go to women and minorities," he said. It wasn't a perfect situation, but it 
also wasn't too bad for a white male former defense industry worker desperate 
for a job.  
</P>
<P>
 So he took the position. But about a year later when PG&E restructured, 
Tennant was laid off. However, his two teammates -- a black woman with no 
engineering degree and an Indian man with a civil, not electrical, engineering 
background -- kept their jobs, he said. Although Tennant, of Tracy, Calif., now 
has a high-tech job that makes him happy, the memory of his experience at PG&E 
still upsets him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who stayed to do the same thing I was doing were less qualified than I, 
but were kept on because of political correctness," he contends. "What they did 
to me was crummy." PG&E disputes Tennant's version of the story and notes that 
all members of that contract work team are no longer at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 With corporate America culling its ranks, baby boomers scrambling to advance 
and industry anxious to diversify its work force, white men -- particularly 
those in mid-career -- are feeling increasingly left out, fearful and betrayed. 
The best jobs lost in the past decade have been theirs; the best jobs created 
in the future may not be.  
</P>
<P>
 Many view their new competition -- women, blacks, Latinos and Asians -- 
warily, certain that they have lost any chance for equal consideration in this 
shrinking job market. Still, not everyone is sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "One white male came up to me and said, 'I'm being treated like a minority, 
and I don't like it,' " says Harris Sussman, president of Workways, a 
consulting firm that offers diversity seminars for large corporations. "On the 
one hand, you can hear that he's angry and pained. On the other hand, the women 
and the nonwhites in the room may say, 'So, welcome to the club.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mid-1980s, recession-plagued industries have dispensed with their 
costliest and most-experienced workers through buyouts and downsizing -- both 
long-term structural changes that have purged the workplace of layers of 
mid-level managers. 
</P>
<P>
 A large percentage of the replacement workers have been -- and will continue 
to be -- women, Latinos, Asians and blacks. The result is that white male 
workers are being squeezed from above and below. "It's definitely a wrenching 
experience," says David Lewin, director of the UCLA Institute of Industrial 
Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers of white men in the work force are dropping -- and demographers 
say the trend will continue. The shift is even more dramatic in the managerial 
and professional ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year 47.3% of the work force was composed of white men, down from 50.2% a 
decade earlier, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 1993, 
53% of all professional and managerial workers were white men, a significant 
drop from 63.5% in 1983. Among the upper ranks, white women have been the major 
beneficiaries of men's loss of dominance, although the decade has seen an 
increased number of Latinos, Asians and blacks become managers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 When looking for work, many white males are faced with want ads that exclude 
them. "You go through the paper, and the ads say, 'English and Spanish 
preferred,' " recounts one former retailing executive now looking for work. 
"What this really means is you have to speak both. For me, not having any other 
language skill is something of a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 At the office, where management often shows heightened concern about career 
opportunities for women and minorities, many white men feel any chance for 
advancement has withered away. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, about a third of the nation's largest firms have 
instituted "diversity awareness" training programs that try to explain the 
reasons for the attention on opening the workplace to all employees and to ease 
the pain that may cause. 
</P>
<P>
 However, such classes often do as much harm as good. "If you just put on a 
single diversity talk, people's awareness may be raised to a point where they 
realize there's not much diversity where they are," Sussman says. "There is 
increasing discomfort and concern about it, especially by white men." 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, which has trained nearly all its U.S.-based workers in diversity 
awareness, has recently added a seminar to its sensitivity training catalogue, 
one called "White Men: The Dilemma." (Informally, the program is known as the 
"Whimpering White Men Lectures.") 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the pleasant surprises is that the nonwhite male participants have 
told us that they come away from these courses with a more sensitive view of 
white men," said Burke Stinson, an AT&T spokesman. "The tendency to throw all 
white men into one pail is (one) they avoid." 
</P>
<P>
 To many, however, it is still relatively easy to make sweeping generalizations 
about the need for a "natural correction" in the workplace that equalizes the 
job differences among the races and genders at the expense of the white male. 
Much more difficult, admits Sussman, is to deal with an individual's concerns 
by supplying a personalized road map through the increasingly complex 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few guidelines he offers is for workers to kill what remaining 
shreds of loyalty they may still have for the company that employs them. "I 
believe the new reality is that everyone is self-employed," he says, even if 
they work for a Fortune 500 firm. "The sooner they realize it, the better off 
they'll be. They will no longer be stunned when they hear they are no longer 
needed."

CAREERS; SHIFTING GEARS; NEW EXPECTATIONS, SAME APPEAL FOR TODAY'S MBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The MBA may not be the same sure-fire ticket to a high-paying job that it 
often was in the heady 1980s, but the lure of an advanced business degree 
remains potent, especially one from the nation's most prestigious universities. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "The MBA has traditionally been a ticket to challenging and financially 
rewarding careers in management, and I expect it will continue to be so," said 
Charles W. Hickman, director of projects and services at the American Assembly 
of Collegiate Schools of Business. 
</P>
<P>
 New demands from students and employers, however, as well as the nation's 
sobered economy, have combined to modify the traditional business school 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Many schools now put greater emphasis on teaching entrepreneurial skills and 
such so-called soft skills as personnel management, team membership and 
communication. Other schools are integrating disciplines such as marketing and 
finance, and stressing international business. Others are making better use of 
new technologies and more industry-specific training in fields such as real 
estate or computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, experts say, seem to have stemmed from what was starting to look 
like a drop in the MBA's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of master's degrees in business administration grew 
steadily until the early 1990s -- more than 700 colleges awarded about 78,000 
MBAs in 1991 -- a few signs indicating a decline started to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the number of students taking the Graduate Management Aptitude 
Test has fallen about 16% in the last two years. The GMAT is the main entry 
exam for graduate business schools. At the John E. Anderson Graduate School of 
Management at UCLA, the class of 1995 has 47 fewer students than the one that 
graduates this year, which in turn has 21 fewer students than the class before. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent surveys suggest, however, that MBA graduates from well-regarded schools 
can still command good starting salaries at the firms of their choice -- a 
sharp contrast to anecdotal evidence that MBA holders are finding it ever more 
difficult to get jobs in an economy characterized by widespread corporate 
downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reasons offered by the latest surveys is a more realistic set of 
expectations among executives regarding the abilities of MBA graduates. In the 
1980s, some corporate officers seemed to view the degree as a panacea for a 
company's ills. At the time, failed expectations soured some companies on MBAs. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for MBAs this year should be up, according to the Lindquist-Endicott 
Report, a widely read employment survey of Northwestern University. The report 
forecasts that MBA hiring this year will increase almost 13% over 1993, after 
several years of up and down demand for business degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, 1994 salaries for MBAs with technical undergraduate degrees 
are expected to climb 7.4%, to $51,540, the report predicts. For MBAs with 
non-technical undergraduate degrees, salaries are expected to rise 3.4%, to 
$49,584. 
</P>
<P>
 The positive outlook distinguishes MBA graduates from their colleagues in 
other professional degree programs, such as law. There, "the market seems to 
have gotten more competitive," said Sandford Lechtick, president of Esquire 
Legal Search Consultants, a legal placement firm in Los Angeles. "Some firms 
have cut back on the number of lawyers on staff, and others have cut back on 
recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Bartron, for one, is glad she went back to school to earn her MBA. She 
didn't always think she would. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the kind of person who said, 'Four years and that's it; I never want to 
go to school again,' " said Bartron, 28. After earning an undergraduate degree 
in political science and organizational behavior from Brown University, she got 
a job as an account executive at a Los Angeles advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-and-a-half years of that job persuaded her that an MBA might be a ticket 
to the executive suite. "Advertising . . . kind of eats you up and spits you 
out," she said. "I decided if I were going to go into marketing . . . that an 
MBA would definitely help." 
</P>
<P>
 She enrolled at UCLA and earned her MBA in June. The degree led to a position 
as assistant marketing manager for E. & J. Gallo Winery in Modesto, with more 
responsibility, fewer hours and about triple the salary of her former job. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate school turned out to mean more than simply climbing the corporate 
ladder, she added. "It was the best thing I've ever done for myself, in terms 
of growing and a self-discovery experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Things have changed for MBAs from the 1980s, when the popular -- and not 
entirely accurate -- perception was that an MBA could command a six-figure 
salary on Wall Street right out of school, and retire in 10 years as a 
millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the economy has changed the types of companies that are hiring 
MBAs. Now there are many more small- and medium-sized firms interested in 
hiring managers, not deal-makers, said William P. Pierskalla, dean of the 
Anderson school at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a change in the kinds of students pursuing MBAs. At UCLA, fewer 
nascent General Motors executives or future Michael Milkens seem to be 
enrolled, although the fallen junk-bond king did act as a guest lecturer for 
one UCLA business class last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, "there's a changing focus among the young people who come to get the 
degree to be more entrepreneurial," Pierskalla said. "Students want to create a 
career for themselves that makes them fairly independent." 
</P>
<P>
 For Terri Focht, the new approach helped broaden her horizons. Focht, 28, 
entered UCLA's MBA program after concluding that her bachelor's degrees in 
economics and psychology did not give her enough breadth of knowledge in 
business.

CAREERS; SHIFTING GEARS; FORETHOUGHT IS KEY WHEN STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Carlene Gibson believed that if anyone could start her own business, it was 
she. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Gibson had headed Cypress College's Training and Economic 
Development office, which educated would-be entrepreneurs. When the college 
eliminated the program in 1991, Gibson decided to provide the services herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the contacts and had done the groundwork," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 But it soon became clear that she didn't have everything it takes to be an 
entrepreneur. It wasn't a lack of cash or a poor plan, the leading causes of 
failed start-ups. Rather, Gibson's problem was her need to be around people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized my energy comes from being with people, people who are generating 
ideas all the time," she said. "As I sat in the office in my home, I didn't 
have anyone to talk to. I was not of that temperament. I need people." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the dean of admissions at Cypress College, Gibson's on-and-off struggle 
with self-employment is a poignant illustration of the dimensions of the 
problems facing would-be entrepreneurs. Money, products, vision and energy are 
all important. But one of the most significant, and perhaps most overlooked, 
ingredients is personality.  
</P>
<P>
 Having the proper attitude and being ready to accept a dramatic change in 
lifestyle are among the factors in successfully launching a business, even if 
it means just hanging out a shingle as a consultant to the industry that once 
employed you. 
</P>
<P>
 Massive layoffs in aerospace, construction, real estate, banking and other 
industries in recession-plagued California have produced a bumper crop of 
bright, motivated people who are thinking about becoming self-employed. 
Certainly there are ample attractions to being your own boss. 
</P>
<P>
 You have control over your duties, hours and income. You're able to hire the 
talent you want to work with, and there's the overall satisfaction of 
succeeding or failing on your own and, perhaps, of eventually providing work 
for others. Women, in particular, often see self-employment as an alternative 
to the glass ceiling that holds many back in corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming self-employed also allows some people "to go back to what they really 
wanted to do when they were 20 years old," said Greg Kishel, director of the 
Orange County Small Business Development Center in Santa Ana. "Maybe they 
wanted to be a photographer or an architect, and now they've been given a 
second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 But the challenges are just as numerous. There's the lack of a routine 
paycheck, and no employer to pay for your health insurance, sick leave, 
vacation time, unemployment benefits and workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 You might hire the people you want, but you also have to deal with their 
problems. There are the threats to your own well-being caused by sleepless 
nights and other stress. The uncertainty of your new venture also can unsettle 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Robbins knows both the good and bad. After working as a Hughes Aircraft 
Co. engineer for 11 years, he took a voluntary retirement offer in 1992 and 
started Bad Moon Books, a mail-order provider of science-fiction, horror and 
mystery books. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, 38, had been collecting such books for 15 years, and he jumped at the 
chance to turn his passion into commerce. But because he runs the fledgling 
firm from his Anaheim home, he learned it can cause lifestyle problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had envisioned that when I went into business for myself, that it would be 
pretty low-key with minor stress," he said. Instead, "I tend to be pretty 
driven," and it's a struggle "knowing when to turn off the business and get on 
with my life and not neglect my family," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you have the right disposition, what tools do you need to be 
successful? 
</P>
<P>
 "The single most critical thing is you must have a good plan," said Susan Fox, 
director of the Business Ownership Service System (BOSS), a program to train 
laid-off aerospace and defense workers run from Kishel's center in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Success also means "being willing to gain knowledge and experience in the 
business you wish to go into," said Bert Dragin, a Los Angeles counselor for 
the Service Corp. of Retired Executives , an arm of the U.S. Small Business 
Administration that provides free help to would-be entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 That suggestion might sound simplistic. But Dragin said a surprising number of 
people say they want to open a restaurant, for instance, without ever having 
worked in one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We advise them to take a job in a restaurant and learn the business before 
they mortgage their house or sell the farm to open the restaurant of their 
dreams," Dragin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, the book seller, agreed. "Make sure that whatever you're going into, 
that you have an incredibly deep knowledge" of the business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-employment is no place for the shy, Dragin said. Even with a solid 
business plan, "you've still got to sell someone" on your product or service, 
he said. "That's what a lot of people are afraid to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget the familiar bane of most people launching their own firms: 
insufficient cash. 
</P>
<P>
 There are lenders that provide start-up capital, but too often the 
entrepreneur mistakenly thinks he doesn't need much of his own money to get 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of those that come through (the door) are people looking for 
100% financing," said James Whitney, head of the Small Business Administration 
loan division of American Pacific State Bank, a Sherman Oaks-based bank that 
specializes in that type of lending. 
</P>
<P>
 But at American Pacific, the entrepreneur is expected to kick in 20% to 50% of 
the new firm's total "project costs" -- the initial cash needed for working 
capital, inventory, equipment and other operating costs, he said. Starting Your 
Own Business 
</P>
<P>
 Want to launch your own business? Here are organizations that provide courses, 
counseling, booklets and other services to help you, often at no charge.

in California. To find the center nearest you, call the state SBDC office at 
(916) 324-5068 or contact your local office of the U.S. Small Business 
Administration.

CAREERS; SHIFTING GEARS; CAREERS FOR THE AGES; PREPARING FOR BRAVE NEW WORLD OF 
WORK MEANS BREAKING OUT OF LOCK-STEP NOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, careers were linear.  
</P>
<P>
 They started when you were young. They ended when you were old. There were a 
few, mostly predictable landmarks along the way. Maybe you moved: upward, 
downward, sideways. Maybe you made new connections, met new people. Maybe you 
switched firms. Maybe you had a mid-life crisis, and then got over it. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the individual deviations, you could plot your progress against a 
stable societal standard: career was the X axis, age the Y. You knew where you 
were supposed to be, and when. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the career graph is broken. Huge changes in the economy have distorted the 
lines. Corporations are cutting white-collar, managerial jobs by the tens of 
thousands. Manufacturing jobs are going overseas. Businesses are increasingly 
relying on temporary contract workers rather than hiring full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, each generation -- having progressed to its proper point on the 
old graph -- is left scrambling to find a new guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Generation X, the twentysomethings, face a tougher job market than their 
parents or their parents' parents. People in mid-career are often left 
wondering what it was they spent the last 10 years pursuing and why. Older 
workers, who trudged dutifully along their paths until the end was in sight, 
suddenly face some unexpected zigs and zags before they can retire. 
</P>
<P>
 With the abrupt loss of continuity, age divisions become increasingly sharp. 
Sometimes the generations blame each other for their predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not going to be much of a job market for college graduates until 
those baby boomers start retiring," grouses a typical Xer. Older workers see 
the young, cheap labor force as a potent threat.  
</P>
<P>
 But while there is generational competition, each group is absorbed mainly 
with the task of redrawing its own graph, and recrafting the concept of 
"career." 
</P>
<P>
 Generation Xers work part-time, overtime or shift between jobs many of their 
parents don't consider "real." Part of that is the result of economic reality 
and part of it is by choice. They see how the slavish devotion of time and soul 
required of their parents' careers has paid off and they're not anxious to 
imitate it.  
</P>
<P>
 The thirty- and fortysomethings, often high-powered and ultra-directed, are 
reassessing their values, thinking more about making work enjoyable. Flexible 
hours, working from home, having more control over their lives are being woven 
more tightly into the definition of career success. 
</P>
<P>
 For older workers, the terror that comes with the realization that the end may 
not be as steady as expected also brings the realization that unpredictability 
can be invigorating. The end does not have to be the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the dilemmas is that people of all generations are needing to change 
careers," says Richard Knowdell, executive director of the Career Planning & 
Adult Development Network in San Jose. "In the year 2000, close to half the 
jobs there are going to be (then) have not been created yet. We all have to 
change our paradigm of what the rules are in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the stories of three workers facing these changes.

 When Lourdes Francisco gets together with her friend, Barbara Matias, the 
conversation often turns to their jobs. It can sometimes get depressing.  
</P>
<P>
 The two recent college grads, both 25, are clerical workers. Well, sort of. 
Matias is a "coordinator." But she does a lot of faxing. Francisco's situation 
is more clear-cut: "I'm a secretary," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years at UCLA, a bachelor's degree in psychology and some impressive job 
experience as a mental health coordinator for the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency during a riot recovery project in fall 1992, just after graduation, were 
not enough to land Francisco a job in her field. It wasn't that she didn't 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent out about 60 resumes," she says. Several interviewers told her she 
needed more experience. "They told me there are people with master's (degrees) 
out there that are out of a job. The competition is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The twentysomething crowd has become known as the slacker generation -- 
underemployed, unambitious and, all in all, unexceptional. But Francisco says 
that's a bad rap. The truth is, her generation faces one of the tougher job 
markets in several decades, in part because of the recession and in part 
because the generation that came before hers -- the in-your-face baby boomers 
-- is so large. 
</P>
<P>
 With many of the boomers out of work, recent college graduates find themselves 
competing with older applicants who have vastly more experience. And those 
positions that are open to younger workers are often entry-level with little 
room for advancement. Says Francisco: "Even if I did get a job in my field, I'd 
be making less than $18,000 a year and doing a graveyard shift probably." She 
makes $26,000 as a secretary.  
</P>
<P>
 It makes for a rethinking of what it means to have a "career."  
</P>
<P>
 "Barbara and I talk about that a lot," Francisco says. "You're out of college 
and you expect a nice job, or at least the kind of job you thought you were 
getting trained for in school, and you have to settle for less. It's really 
frustrating. The older generation, the people in their 30s and 40s had it much 
easier. "  
</P>
<P>
 "You need an MBA and 10 years of experience to get a consultant position now," 
Francisco notes. "I know some of the vice presidents here that started a long 
time ago only had a BA. One of them didn't even finish college. It's really 
amazing, the change." 
</P>
<P>
 When her own job search proved fruitless, Francisco went to a temporary 
agency. Her typing skills -- and the fact that she knew the owner of the 
agency, who steered her into one of the higher-paying temp jobs -- helped her 
get the secretarial job. Eventually, the management consultant firm hired her 
as a permanent employee. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not complaining. "They treat me really well. It's stable, good benefits, 
good salary. I'm just glad I'm working," she said. "There are so many people 
out there who aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude distresses her father, a lawyer in the Philippines, who likes to 
remind Lourdes of a speech she made in kindergarten when she declared her 
ambition to become a doctor. Her father, who made a similar speech at that age 
about becoming a lawyer, tells her he "stuck with it." Her response: "OK, this 
is really realistic, Dad. Give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Francisco doesn't plan to be a secretary forever. She may return to 
graduate school for a master's degree in public health. Or she may brush up on 
her Spanish and become a bilingual teacher. She has thought about becoming 
licensed to take care of children and starting a day-care center.  
</P>
<P>
 "But for now, this is what I have to do. I have to pay back loans; I have to 
make money. When I think of a career, I think I like dealing with people. Maybe 
I'll be a teacher; that's more like a 'career.' But I really don't even know 
what that means. It's hard to define."

<P>
 In the 1980s, Mira Anixt-Greenwald was a yuppie -- a highly sought-after one 
at that. Working in direct marketing for Citibank's credit card division in New 
York, she was used to getting regular calls from head hunters. She was in high 
demand and itching to continue her upward trajectory. She was exactly where she 
wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a headhunter's call that brought the high-powered thirtysomething to 
Los Angeles four years ago to work as an account manager at a well-known 
advertising agency. But when the firm's major account, Security Pacific Bank, 
merged with Bank of America two years later, she found herself out of work, out 
of step -- and a little scared. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time ever, she was looking at the job listings in the 
newspapers. For the first time ever, she called the head hunters herself. And 
for the first time, they had nothing to offer her.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Anixt-Greenwald found a sales job at a marketing information firm, 
for considerably less money than she'd been used to commanding. It wasn't 
anything like the work she had done before. Instead of conceptualizing 
marketing ideas, she was telemarketing computer software to businesses. And 
with the Southern California economy in a slump, it was, she says, "a very hard 
sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago she left the firm. Now, with the help of an outplacement 
counseling program, Anixt-Greenwald, 37, is rethinking her priorities, laying 
plans for what could be a very different career from the one she had pursued 
since college. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first moved out here, it was like a brave new world," Anixt-Greenwald 
remembers. "I was going to network myself to death and make as much money as I 
possibly could, and I was so optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 But she took a 25% pay cut to land a job after being laid off from her 
$70,000-a-year-plus-stock-options marketing job, and faces the potential of 
another cut now. However, that prospect is less onerous than it would have been 
several years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Now money isn't as important to her. Although she would like to pull down at 
least $65,000 per year, she is willing to trade her salary demands for a more 
flexible job arrangement. "If I don't have to, I don't want to go back into a 
traditional setting. I'd like to be self-employed and have enough freedom to 
have a family," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many people her age who have been involuntarily derailed from unbroken 
career tracks by the economic recession, Anixt-Greenwald is re-evaluating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am 37, and I'm at a point were I'm looking at a lot of different 
things. I'd like to find something that I love. I'm married now, so I'm 
thinking about having children. So maybe I find a part-time job that I can work 
into my day-to-day life, that wouldn't interfere with having a family. . .But 
those are not the types of jobs that really pay well, so I'm not sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon the advice of career counselor Susan Miller at Vocational Training 
Consulting Services, Anixt-Greenwald is drafting several resumes. And, she 
says, she is somewhat surprised at how many directions she could take. 
</P>
<P>
 Options include working with her husband's real estate business (she's in the 
midst of getting her brokers' license) or looking for a marketing job in the 
budding interactive multimedia industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is a return to nonprofit work. When she was a 
communications undergraduate, an internship at a nonprofit firm led to her 
first job in 1980 as a direct marketing manager and launched her career. 
"That's the kind of job I'd love," Anixt-Greenwald says. "But I know I'd have 
to compromise on salary." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if she doesn't go the nonprofit route, Anixt-Greenwald realizes she may 
never make the kind of money she expected to be making when she looked ahead to 
this point in the early days of her career.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very service-oriented background. I've worked in marketing 
departments and ad agencies as an account executive, and there are so many 
people out there that are looking for these types of positions. You can find a 
$40,000-a-year-person for a job that somebody used to get $60,000-$80,000 for," 
Anixt-Greenwald says. "It's pretty amazing."

 Jimmy Crabtree started working at McDonnell Douglas when the aircraft company 
was setting out to build its very first commercial jet. The year was 1957. He 
was just out of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Crabtree is still at Douglas; he's one of the lucky ones and he knows 
it. But after nearly four decades of steady predictability, the 55-year-old 
engineer, like many of his colleagues, is suddenly confronting the unexpected: 
For the first time in his long aerospace career, Crabtree's future is far from 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truthfully, at my age, there's not much out there in the way of a job 
market," Crabtree admits. "I'm counting on sticking around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although optimistic, Crabtree finds his situation bewildering. Like most men 
of his generation, Crabtree was raised to believe career planning is a one-time 
event in life. You decided what you were going to do when you graduated and -- 
so long as you worked hard -- you followed a straight line from that moment 
until retirement at age 60 or 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all that has changed.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last year dozens of Crabtree's engineering colleagues have lost their 
jobs. Of those who looked for new jobs, most have yet to find one. 
</P>
<P>
 Many simply retired early -- an option Crabtree says isn't feasible for him, 
largely because Douglas recently dropped guaranteed lifetime medical insurance 
for its retirees and dependents.  
</P>
<P>
 It was an especially painful blow to Crabtree, whose wife is a quadriplegic. 
He doesn't know how he's going to pay the steady stream of medical bills once 
the company withdraws its support.  
</P>
<P>
 "After that, we have no idea what happens," Crabtree says. "It was something 
we kind of counted on. It was one of those things that helped entice us to have 
a career here -- the benefit package for the future. It's been a real shock for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the massive cutbacks in the aerospace industry are not limited to 
older workers. "The young ones have been suffering too," Crabtree notes. But 
while many are starting over, switching industries or venturing into business 
for themselves, Crabtree feels in no position to start something new. "It's a 
little late to be thinking about a new career," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly started out on the right track. As a boy, Crabtree had always 
been fascinated by aviation. When he heard Douglas was having an open test for 
drafting trainees, he headed south from his California hometown of Kingsburg to 
Santa Monica and entered the company's training program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an eight-week course held in West Los Angeles," Crabtree remembers. "I 
worked six years at the Santa Monica and Culver City plants until I got caught 
in the 1963 layoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 But in those days, when an aerospace engineer got laid off, he could almost 
always find a job with a competitor. "It was almost like you could just walk 
across the street," Crabtree says. He spent the next six years at North 
American, working on the Saturn missile launcher for the moon shot -- the 
booster for the Apollo program.  
</P>
<P>
 Later he bounced back to Douglas, then to Northrop, on to Rockwell and then 
back again to Douglas in 1978. "I've been here ever since," Crabtree says. 
"Twenty-seven-and-a-half years." 
</P>
<P>
 As an engineer in the product support division, Crabtree's chances for keeping 
his job are better than most. The 150 engineers in his department handle 
aircraft that have already been delivered, and there are plenty of planes out 
there that need service for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been cutbacks all over, and that has meant a quickening in the 
pace of work -- and a heightening of the stress level.  
</P>
<P>
 "The way things work today, it's not a function of seniority. It's a matter of 
whether your type of expertise is needed at the moment or not. If you don't 
perform, you don't have a future." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees live in fear of "RIF" slips, the industry acronym for "reduction in 
force," which means involuntary layoffs for unspecified amounts of time. In 
some departments, the clawing to remain employed has led to increased 
competition among colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, looking back, Crabtree says he has "loved the industry. It's been good 
to me." One thing he would do differently, though: "In the past, I would have 
recommended it highly to a youngster coming out of college. But based on the 
way it's been going I would not recommend it any more."

 The era of the hotshot is over. Executive recruiters and other employment 
specialists say companies increasingly are looking for team players -- and 
giving the brushoff to prima donnas -- when they make hiring decisions these 
days. Employers' attitudes have changed sharply from a few years ago, when 
companies put more emphasis on technical prowess and less on interpersonal 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The '80s was a 'me' decade . . . There's been a reaction to that. Those kinds 
of people may be brilliant, but one person can't do everything," said John A. 
Challenger, executive vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a 
Chicago-based firm that helps laid-off workers find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long gone are the days when (employers) just hired a hotshot and brought them 
aboard," said Cecile V. Munoz, a Los Angeles consultant who advises businesses 
on employment issues. "My clients are trying to bring aboard people who mesh 
well and work together harmoniously." 
</P>
<P>
 A main reason for the change is that so many companies are operating with lean 
staffs, the result of rounds of layoffs. These firms can no longer afford as 
many specialists or other employees who balk at performing tasks outside their 
normal duties. Instead, employment specialists say, firms want people who are 
willing to "pitch in." 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to like change and to be adaptable," said Sandra Young, co-owner of 
Womens Focus/Career Focus, a career development and job placement firm in 
Tustin. Further, such in-vogue management concepts as "total quality 
management" and "self-managed work teams" rely on extensive cooperation among 
peers in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "With one bad apple, the whole thing is messed up," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on building a staff of team players comes at a time when, 
according to business etiquette mavens, interpersonal behavior at many 
workplaces is hitting a new low and rudeness is getting out of hand. "People 
have forgotten the basics that your mother taught you," said Richard A. Moran, 
author of the hot-selling gift book, "Never Confuse a Memo with Reality." 
</P>
<P>
 "People are so worried about their jobs that they avoid dealing with workplace 
etiquette issues with their bosses and co-workers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some experts worry the current hiring mood may be leading to 
excesses. "Everyone is looking for individuals who will do more," said Gary 
Kaplan, owner of a Pasadena executive recruiting firm. "It's the whole issue of 
doing more with less. We've gone to a sweatshop mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Kaplan said, in the push for collegiality, some firms "are losing 
out on individuals who are strong-minded and opinionated, the type who take no 
prisoners." As a result, he said, some firms are missing out on the most 
talented people. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the experts acknowledge that so-called "people skills" are likely to 
remain crucial on the job. "Everyone is vulnerable these days," Moran 
explained, and those who handle business situations with class and grace are 
likely to be the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 One employer reflecting the trend is Provident Investment Counsel, a 
Pasadena-based firm that manages investments for pension funds and 
profit-sharing plans. Two years ago, Provident hired a psychologist to screen 
its job applicants for clerical positions. Among other things, the psychologist 
tested applicants to determine their general attitude toward work and their 
willingness to work with others, with the overall goal of gauging how 
compatible they would be with their prospective supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The results have been impressive. Provident has had no turnover among the 
roughly 30 clerical staffers it has hired since beginning its new approach, 
versus annual turnover of 15% or higher before, said Thad Brown, the firm's 
senior vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still very much looking for people with the ability to think on their 
feet and people who can work on projects on their own. But we're also looking 
for a situation where we won't have to spend nine months working out personnel 
problems" after new hires are made, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now end up with team players. We end up with people who are compatible 
with each other." Before, he said, "We'd see one or two people in a department 
bring down their entire department because they were disgruntled." 
</P>
<P>
 In hiring executives, too, companies have changed their priorities. "They're 
looking for people who are natural leaders, who can build consensus and manage 
in a non-authoritarian manner," said Kaplan, adding that many firms are looking 
for "people who are willing to make things happen themselves rather than direct 
someone else to make things happen."  
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on team players has been a boon to people such as Louis Rovner, a 
psychologist and head of the Woodland Hills consulting firm Employee Selection 
Services. He devised the test being successfully used by Provident to screen 
job applicants for compatibility with their prospective supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he designed the test after recognizing that in most cases, firings and 
resignations stem from "personality conflicts, even though that might not be 
the reason stated on paper. Somebody is just not getting along."

CAREERS; SHIFTING GEARS; SOME FATHERLY ADVICE; REMEMBER, WHAT WORKS FOR ONE

<P>
 I am constantly giving my son job advice. He doesn't really listen. Good for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 What the hell, I didn't listen to my father. Back in the '60s he advised me to 
go into aerospace technical writing. It pays much more than journalism, he said 
-- and that was the only thing he was right about. An aerospace engineer in the 
heady days of the Cold War, my father had used his fat Boeing paychecks to 
build a beautiful house in a Seattle forest. But by the time he was in his 
mid-50s, Boeing had laid him off, and he was scratching to sell real estate in 
Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that what my father accepted as the norm -- steady, lucrative 
employment at companies that repaid loyalty with security -- had been just 
another economic upswing. Sure, that was probably naive of him, but now I 
wonder whether my generation is any wiser.  
</P>
<P>
 We accepted the values of our parents: Work, have a family, support them, lift 
the kids a rung above you on the ladder -- just as your parents did. And I hear 
myself passing on the same American Dream mantra to my high school graduate, 
who's already well into his 20s.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the words have changed a bit. You're not interested in college? 
OK, I say, but you can still get some security by excelling at a skill in 
demand. Choose something, I advise, where there is room to excel, where the 
best is a lot better than the average. People want the best mechanic to work on 
their cars, but they don't care whether the best carrier delivers their mail. 
Nowadays, if you start at the bottom, you're likely to stay at the bottom.  
</P>
<P>
 The only problem is, my homilies lack conviction. Is it really still possible 
for someone without a Stanford business degree, highly prized skills and a 
driving ambition to live the American Dream as we did? 
</P>
<P>
 (And why didn't I say "as we do"?) 
</P>
<P>
 I graduated from high school in California in 1960. If you had good grades, 
you didn't think about junior college. You could go to the University of 
California. And because you were a Californian, the state wanted you there. It 
built huge dormitories to accommodate huge freshman classes and made the fees 
cheap. Really cheap. I'm-a-trucker-but-I'm-sending-my kid-to-college cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 So why didn't my son's friends, all of them sharp guys, get university 
educations? Because nowadays you need more than just good grades to get in. You 
need super grades, they tell me. And none of their families can afford the 
immense fees and the wasted time? 
</P>
<P>
 Wasted? 
</P>
<P>
 Wasted, they say. Unless you're coming out of law school, it doesn't translate 
into money. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are so many of my son's friends, all in their mid-20s, still unmarried? 
Because as soon as you're married, they tell me, your wife costs you half of 
your money. Then your chances are gone. If you want even to get your foot on 
the ladder, you have to save, save, save. Marriage and family are definitely 
back-burner. 
</P>
<P>
 How are they going to make it? By being the boss, the only guy who's going to 
be making any money anymore, they tell me. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my son's friends works at a carpet-cleaning service. He endures the 
ghastly hours and the slavish labor, believing that in a few years he'll have 
saved enough money to start his own carpet-cleaning service. Then he'll be 
handling the cash box and the prod instead of the oar. Then it's hello, 
American Dream . . . if there's any time left. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a workplace that seems alien to me, but is it really? 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere I see traditional employees being gently or not-so-gently shown the 
door and replaced by the newer models. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ones are young and grateful -- that's nothing new. But they don't 
expect benefits such as retirement and health insurance -- now or maybe ever -- 
and that is new. Those who snag jobs even with poor health insurance plans feel 
as if they've struck gold. 
</P>
<P>
 These jobs are designed to be cheaply filled and conveniently jettisoned. The 
people who have them don't seem to be employees to me. They seem more like the 
vanguard of what may lie ahead, a work force that is, in effect, self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
 Will their jobs survive the slightest economic ripples? Will they be replaced 
by an outside contractor as soon as a good bid comes in? Will they ever be able 
to make plans based on any kind of job security? I wonder what awaits my son 
and his friends when they are as old as I am. I wonder whether I am being too 
pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 But I no longer wonder whether my fatherly advice has any validity. I sadly 
know that it doesn't. What I counsel is irrelevant, because it is based on a 
life I thought was ordinary but was, I fear, America's Golden Age.
