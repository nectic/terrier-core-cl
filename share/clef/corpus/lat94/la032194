STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: FOR STRANDED FREEWAY MOTORISTS, A KNIGHT IN A 
SHINING TOW TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is one of the easy days -- a rare day when the temperamental tide of the 
Ventura Freeway forgoes its usual tantrums and flows as smoothly as in one of 
those washed-out driver's training films. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means we're doing our jobs," says Mike Dizacomo as he edges his tow truck 
into the noisy current of metal and rubber, scanning for breaks between the 
cars and looking for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush hour on the Freeway Service Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tow truck operator in the taxpayer-supported patrol, Dizacomo spends the 
morning and afternoon rush hours trying to keep Southern California's 
automotive arteries clear of the clogs that knock commuters' blood pressures 
off the scale. Dizacomo's mission -- and the that of other tow truck operators 
in the Freeway Service Patrol -- is to repair flat tires, recharge dead 
batteries and cool overheated radiators. 
</P>
<P>
 He has even patched a broken accelerator with a piece of baling wire. 
</P>
<P>
 All for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by Proposition C and state highway funds, the patrol is an effective 
tool in combatting freeway congestion. The California Department of 
Transportation -- which operates the program with the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority and the California Highway Patrol -- estimates that 
the tow trucks cut freeway delays 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 140 trucks contracted to the 2-year-old program cover 44 stretches 
of Los Angeles County freeways from Long Beach to Calabasas, more than 400 
miles in all. 
</P>
<P>
 Each driver covers a specific beat. Dizacomo's stretches 10 miles along the 
Ventura Freeway between Reseda Boulevard and Las Virgenes Road -- a 20-mile 
loop he will patrol 12 to 14 times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of coverage means that more than half of the 1,250 motorists 
assisted each day are reached within five minutes -- sometimes before they walk 
up to an emergency call box. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I will not leave you until you are either on your way or off the 
freeway," says Dizacomo, whose job demands him to alternately play the roles of 
a MacGyver, a Job and a Freud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you are stopped at the shoulder, the freeway is a different place than it 
seems from behind the wheel at 65. It is bigger. And much louder. It is 
downright scary. Blurred 18-wheelers rumble and groan just inches away. 
</P>
<P>
 The solid, white line seems thin and not quite so solid. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the freeway Dizacomo knows. "It's a dangerous situation to be stuck 
out here when everyone else is zipping by you at 65 miles per hour," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And he knows. Tow truck operators have been killed by the protruding side 
mirrors of cars and the handles of garbage trucks. Dizacomo has had close 
calls, such as the time he was nearly squashed by a skidding pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 He never turns his back on traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while, you learn to jump," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger comes not only from the cars and the trucks coursing past, but also 
from the people who drive them. Dizacomo recalls an eerie, pre-dawn moment in 
October when he came across a small pickup abandoned in the middle of the 
just-opened Century Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a puddle of blood and this drip, drip, drip," Dizacomo says. "And 
the engine was still running, so that was strike two." Flashing his light into 
the cab, Dizacomo discovered a man lying face down behind the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been shot in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 And he was lying on top of another man whose life had been snuffed in the same 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Only minutes before, Dizacomo had passed the spot and the pickup had not been 
there. "Somebody had just put the truck there," he said. "If I had seen him, 
what would he have done to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, motorists are glad to see Dizacomo's bulky frame 
approaching in their rear-view mirrors. On a recent morning, Dizacomo gave 
directions to a lost motorist, provided water for a broken radiator and 
directed traffic after a tractor-trailer's brakes locked up and blocked 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a slow day. He towed no one. On an average morning, he may help seven 
or eight motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 He will pull his truck behind anyone stopped at the side of the freeway -- 
whether or not they have called for help. He has urged drivers pausing for a 
catnap to find a safer spot. He has stumbled onto mothers nursing their babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "And some people can't wait to go to the bathroom," he says, relating the tale 
of a woman who was caught literally and proverbially with her pants down. "I 
said, 'Oops,' and threw it in reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 12 years of towing, Dizacomo has learned that the little things can make 
all the difference. He has plugged motorcycle tires with a patch of duct tape 
and can change a tire in less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 He is relentlessly friendly, even to the woman who once insisted on lighting 
up in the cab of Dizacomo's truck, which is decorated with magnets thanking you 
for not smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the morning traffic on the Ventura Freeway zips past, Dizacomo keeps 
his truck steady in the slow lane at 55 m.p.h. "Most people are in a hurry to 
get to work," he said. "I'm already at work." 
</P>
<P>
 Most do not even know he is there. Until they need him. Then they often 
suspect he is a freeway predator offering a tow for a hefty fee. Except for 
small decals on his truck and a patch on his tidy, blue coveralls, there is is 
nothing indicating that he is working for the taxpayers. So often he laughs and 
explains that it is all free. No, really. It's free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the magic words: 'It's free.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He is not allowed to accept tips. Sometimes, grateful motorists will insist 
and insist, despite his refusals. In those cases, the money is turned over to 
the CHP and donated to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, a woman gave him a hug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked, 'Do I have to turn this in?' I sure don't want to hug those guys 
back at the garage."

GEORGE RAMOS: A MATTER NOT OF RACE, BUT OF RIGHT AND WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found out quickly that Don Lopez is different when I telephoned the other 
day. It was the way he answered the phone: "Racist's residence." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez says it was his own stab at humor because of all the abuse he's been 
taking lately. You see, he is vehemently opposed to the presence of 
Spanish-speaking day laborers looking for work in his neighborhood in Ladera 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others in the comfortable, mostly African American neighborhood say the 
men -- immigrants who station themselves at the parking lot entrances to a 
HomeBase store -- are a blight and a danger to the area. At times, the 
residents say, the laborers urinate on their lawns, make lewd comments to 
residents and make some parents fear for their children's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandson of Mexican immigrants who is fluent in Spanish, Lopez shakes his 
head at being called a racist by the laborers, little old ladies and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does that happen?" Lopez, 39, asks. "Explain it to me. I'm no racist." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, I was drawn to the squabble in Ladera Heights because it's another 
sign of tensions between the city's two largest minority groups -- Latinos and 
blacks. Latino politicians and community leaders say it is the thorniest issue 
that faces them as they try to make sense of post-riot L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who is black, seemed to be aware of 
it as she chose her words carefully last week in talking about her compromise 
ordinance to defuse the day laborer controversy. She said race doesn't play a 
role in the dispute and cited Lopez's opposition to the day laborers as proof 
that it isn't just a black vs. brown thing. 
</P>
<P>
 When I called Lopez and heard his "racist" greeting, I knew he was one man I 
had to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 When we did at his South-Central auto remanufacturing shop, which sells and 
exports rebuilt auto parts, he proudly told me how his parents, Margarita and 
Gustavo Lopez, began the business in the 1950s and eventually turned it over to 
him and an older sister, Carolyn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't inherit this business," he says. "I bought it from them." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the day laborers in Ladera Heights has worsened in the last 
three years, says Lopez, who has lived in a corner home on Slauson Avenue for 
more than 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The men crowd sidewalks and yards, block traffic and are disrespectful to 
residents. He has talked to them repeatedly about such conduct but says it does 
no good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not opposed to people waiting for the bus or waiting for a ride," he 
says. "That's life. But I do mind having an employment line in front of my 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 He has gone to meetings with immigrant advocates and others in recent months 
to try and find a solution but came away frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it is wrong for laborers to be out on the streets asking for work and 
for their advocates to fight for their right to do so. Organizations such as 
the ACLU would be better served if they helped organize the men so that they 
can meet at an office or building, obtain decent-paying jobs and avoid 
exploitation from conniving employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of gender," he says, "or of race. It's a matter of good and 
bad. . . . There's right and there's wrong, and what these people are doing is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 As I'm listening, I'm trying to keep in check my own sympathies. I feel for 
immigrants because of my own family's history of coming to L.A. from Mexico. 
It's an experience many share. If a Latino is critical of that experience, some 
might suggest that person is rejecting that history. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might even call that person a racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your father who came from Mexico," he asks, "did he teach you to urinate on 
people's lawns?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," I reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he teach you to stand on a corner and ask for work?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't come to that. But what if it's the only way to find work, no matter 
how wrong you think it is? What if it's the only way?" 
</P>
<P>
 After a pause, he remarks, "It's still wrong. I'm not saying you should 
conform or get out. We all have to live in society. There's a right way to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think Lopez is a racist. He's proud of his Mexican roots. And his 
commitment to keep his business in South-Central, where all of his workers are 
minorities, says a lot about him. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't agree with him. You just can't be closed-minded about banning 
job-seekers because of the acts of a few bad apples. The men come there because 
the demand for them seems to be there. Since he does speak Spanish, Lopez can 
help find a solution if he chooses to. 
</P>
<P>
 My dad said, "Find a job, work hard and people will respect you." I'm sure 
Lopez's parents told him the same thing.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one in Southern California is singing "Happy Days Are Here Again," but 
there are signs the recession may finally be leveling off and the local economy 
may be on the way to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The February unemployment rate in L.A. County, by the best estimates, dropped 
to 9.7% from 11% in January and the state gained 9,500 jobs. Still, the state 
reportedly has lost as many as 800,000 jobs since mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can predict when, or if, the state will ever return to its boom days. 
But one thing is certain: The job market -- locally, nationally and abroad -- 
will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the changing job market was the hot topic at a meeting last week in 
Detroit of the finance and labor ministers from the world's seven most 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit meeting did not result in any change in White House policy or new 
legislation. But it underscored what is becoming the consensus among experts: 
The best way to improve job opportunities is to improve education, training and 
worker skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Those conclusions are particularly apt for displaced workers in Southern 
California. In today's Community Comment, Mary Anne Rust urges employees to 
re-evaluate their job options, target dynamic industries and enroll in 
retraining programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts, like Jon Goodman, director of the entrepreneur program at USC, 
agree. "Unfortunately, huge numbers of people are being displaced," she says. 
"When looking for a new job, you need to go for new training, lower your 
expectations, be willing to compromise and be willing to be committed to 
lifelong learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman suggests looking at smaller companies with $50 million to $150 million 
in annual revenue. "There are a lot of those companies in L.A. It takes some 
homework to find them because they're not likely to advertise," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Begun, general manager of Search West, an executive search firm in 
Westlake Village, suggests that there are signs that job opportunities in 
Southern California are improving and certain industries remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are better," Begun says. "We're not booming, especially here in 
California. California is going to lag behind the rest of the country. 
Obviously the aerospace industry was hard hit. But a lot of other industries -- 
data processing, health care, insurance, banking, chemicals -- are doing well." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other, perhaps smaller, signs that things are looking up. Jerry 
Houser, director of career development at USC, said his school has had a 21% 
increase in job listings for both full- and part-time jobs in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 But finding a job, the experts agree, ultimately depends on the worker's 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Houser targets two areas that he believes can improve anyone's chances for 
employment: a strong ability in verbal and written communications and the 
ability to collect data accurately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in technical firms, employers want someone who can work in teams, talk 
across cultures and communicate with people," Houser says. "And in this new age 
of business, you need to be able to collect information, reconfigure it and 
understand it."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MODEST PROPOSAL; USE 
COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO LINK NEEDS OF EMPLOYER, UNEMPLOYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORRIS NEUSTADT; Ph.D., former physicist/ mathematician, Los Angeles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a tremendous jobless situation in this country, especially in 
California and particularly in Los Angeles. It is very difficult for an 
unemployed engineer to find a job today. If he looks in the newspaper, there 
are very few advertisements for engineers. I suggest that a "data bank" be 
established to link employers who want to hire people with particular skills to 
jobless people with those skills. 
</P>
<P>
 With the data bank concept, an individual would have his experience, education 
and what he is good at -- such as aerodynamics, mathematics, physics, 
chemistry, accounting, law, acting, typing, managerial, computer proficiency, 
etc. -- entered into a computer. The jobless person would list companies he has 
worked for in the past five, 10, 20 or 30 years as the case may be. 
</P>
<P>
 The data bank concept would marry the employer's needs to the jobless person's 
skills. For example, an employer needs an engineer with capability in 
aerodynamics, structures and computers, as well as a broad background in 
physics. He calls the data bank and gets a list individuals who satisfy his 
requirements along with their telephone numbers and addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an idea whose time has come, namely, the marriage of computer 
technology to the employer's needs for particular personnel and the unemployed 
person's need for a job. This would also enable the federal, state or local 
government to determine where there are significant employer requirements that 
cannot be satisfied locally and could assist in pointing unemployed people to 
states where jobs are available and help people relocate.  
</P>
<P>
 Jobless individuals could apply for inclusion in the data bank in person at an 
office near their homes. The interviewer would ask questions and enter the 
information directly into the computer, eliminating the need for a lot of 
paperwork. An employer seeking a person with a particular capability would call 
in and give his requirements.  
</P>
<P>
 This plan would apply to people in all economic strata. It would also enable 
retired people or those with low incomes to get temporary or part-time 
employment. The data bank could be set up in a few months. It should be 
implemented as soon as possible on a city, state and national level, wherever 
there is a need.

CAREER ADVICE FOR '90S: BE WHAT MARKET WANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE RUST, Mary Anne Rust, a clinical psychologist turned career 
strategist, heads Success Training Institute in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tough job scene is heightening anxiety in workers young and old alike. 
Consider: Last summer, 50% of San Fernando Valley families were reported to 
have had one or more members either unemployed or re-employed at lower wages. A 
recent job fair at the closed GM plant drew 6,000, reminding state Sen. David 
A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) of the soup lines during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 What many people don't understand is that the work world has permanently 
changed. Networking, sending resumes and job fairs are basically ineffectual, 
as computers and other innovations have eliminated layers of jobs for good. The 
key is to reposition into an emerging field. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think job, think career. Often many think of a job as a parking place to 
sell their time to pay for what they enjoy doing after work. A career is an 
opportunity to enjoy work while being paid -- a way to grow, fulfill talents 
and potentials, do something meaningful that gives satisfaction. A talented, 
top-quality worker can always find a good job even in tough times. 
</P>
<P>
 My research has identified more than 3,500 career opportunities that are well 
positioned for the coming decade in terms of demand, job security and earnings 
over $40,000. Some of today's growing industries include telecommunications, 
multimedia, electronics, biotechnology, health care, infrastructure repair, 
financial services and medical support services. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick is to take your talents and interests and put them in sync with what 
the marketplace wants. Points to consider in career positioning include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Read about industry trends in such periodicals as Investor's Business Daily, 
Fortune, Standard & Poor's Outlook, and the Valueline Investment Survey. 
Companies that are good stock picks with solid sales and profits are good 
places to work. The greatest glass ceiling to your career advancement is not 
age or race but working at a struggling company that can't afford raises or 
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assess your talents and strengths from the practical perspective of an 
employer seeking to hire a person to solve a problem and make or save the 
company money, thereby justifying the salary. If you see yourself as "being 
good with people," translate this general quality into a specific job target 
such as customer service, management, sales, market research or administrative 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk to personnel directors to learn what companies are seeking. What job 
skills will they need five years from now? Are you employable as is? If not, 
what training or degree should you get? What local schools do they prefer in 
hiring grads? This will help you decide if you should get more training and 
where. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get more education and training to advance yourself and qualify for the 
better jobs. Don't wait for government programs or employers to train you. 
Investing in yourself to increase your earnings base is the best investment you 
will ever make. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not be a victim of the myth that you are too trapped by family and 
financial obligations to go back to school full time. Federal education loans 
are available; for information, call (800) 831-5626. You may also qualify for 
private loans through the ExtraCredit Board, which can be reached at (800) 
874-9390. 
</P>
<P>
 * If full-time training is impossible, check out business-related 
certification programs at local colleges, which can be done at night. Focus on 
such high-demand programs as accounting, taxation, marketing, 
telecommunications, computer networks, technical writing and desk-top 
publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see the latest economic news as demoralizing; others see it as a wake-up 
call and golden chance to move their lives and careers ahead. The choice is 
yours.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
ONE AGENCY'S APPROACH: FLEX LEGAL MUSCLE FOR TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With few exceptions, unsubsidized "entry level" housing for Los Angeles' 
poorest residents is virtually synonymous with barely affordable and barely 
habitable dwellings according to housing advocates. Thousands of renters reside 
in substandard housing and services to ensure that buildings meet the city's 
code were limited long before the Northridge earthquake added pressure to 
maintain Los Angeles' housing stock. Since 1980, the Inner City Law Center has 
helped the city's poorest tenants in their fight for repairs of seriously 
substandard buildings. Lawyers and private law firms donate services and work 
with the center's staff to sue for building repairs and money damages for 
tenants. In 14 years, the center has yet to lose a single case. Judgments and 
settlements for their clients average more than $100,000. The center combines 
slum housing litigation with services to secure safe, decent housing for the 
disabled homeless. It serves more than 3,600 clients each year. CASE STUDY 
</P>
<P>
 1985 Inner City Law Center initiates lawsuit on behalf of 81 people living in 
a Pico Union slum apartment. Center director Nancy Mintie describes building 
conditions as "hellish." According to the tenants, one mother living there 
miscarried her twins after being attacked by a rat in her apartment, and 
another family lost their firstborn during the winter after he contracted a 
respiratory illness in their unheated apartment that had broken windows and no 
hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 After four years of litigation with co-counsel from the law firm Talcott, 
Lightfoot, Vandevelde, Woehrle & Sandowsky and attorney Barb Blanco the Inner 
City Law Center helps plaintiffs to settle the case for $1.25 million. A 
substantial amount of the money was paid up front. Some tenants bought their 
first homes with the funds, others started businesses or moved to apartments in 
safer neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 1991-93 Collection problems on the remainder of the settlement arise. The 
landlord stops payments altogether after skipping some installments. An 
insurance company that signed the settlement agreement goes into receivership 
and refuses payment. Center staff pursues parties and pressures them to make a 
payment of $247,500 in mid-December. ONE PERSON'S EXPERIENCE 
</P>
<P>
 Luz Duenas 
</P>
<P>
 Student, 25, Los Angeles Community College, lived in building cited in 1985 
lawsuit with five of her nine siblings and her parents who were plaintiffs in 
case. Luz and her family moved into a Los Angeles home purchased three years 
ago with proceeds from her parents' share of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 We used to live in downtown L.A. over by Union and 8th, and we had some 
problems with the building. We wouldn't have water sometimes for a week, 
sometimes for a month. There were a lot of rats and cockroaches. One day my two 
little sisters were taking a bath and part of the ceiling fell down on them. 
The area has a lot of gangs and drugs and the front door to the building was 
always open. It's a very dangerous place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inner City Law Center helped everyone in the building to get the landlord 
to keep the front door locked, to put new carpet and painting in the building, 
to get us hot water and electricity everyday. They also helped my parents and 
the other people who lived there to file a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 If this hadn't happened I think my life and my sisters' would have been 
totally different. I probably would have just worked to help my parents, and 
school would have been very far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking that you have other choices is so important. The center showed us 
there was something else for us other than the conditions we were living in. 
You can live better and have a better life. They taught us not to be scared of 
raising your voice to be heard and to say, "Hey, I'm a human being." And they 
showed us how to work to make sure that other people don't take advantage of 
you because you stay quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of people who are still living in conditions that our family 
lived in. They need to raise their voices and get together and do something. It 
is possible. If you get together you can make a big difference. TO GET INVOLVED

COMMENTARY FROM OTHER MEDIA; TIME FOR IRA TO TAKE ITS SEAT AT PEACE TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a commentary by Finbar Hill in the Irish Tribune, a monthly paper 
published in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is now over two months since the joint declaration of a charter for peace 
and reconciliation in Ireland was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most important aspects was the statement that all parties committed 
to the peace process would be able to take part in the negotiations. This was 
an appeal, in particular, to the IRA to declare peace and for their political 
arm, namely, Sinn Fein, to take their place at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only hope and pray that they heed the wishes of the vast majority of 
the people of Ireland and help establish a United Ireland.

 "I take walks down the path by the Ballona Lagoon to the Marina del Rey 
Channel. It's good for when you need to get the blood flowing through your 
mind.There's some beautiful gardens and a lot of birds. The best thing is you 
see so many people, especially people walking their dogs. Everybody's really 
friendly, and you have a sense of a community. Dogs sort of break down the 
social barriers and you feel more open about starting conversations. " 
</P>

<P>
 The Ballona Lagoon Coastal Access Path is about a mile long, running from 
Washington Street to the Marina del Rey Channel and connecting to the newly 
restored Venice Canals. Ilene Weiss, president of the Ballona Lagoon Marine 
Preserve, says the path borders the only functioning tidal wetland in Los 
Angeles County. There are many species of crabs, clams, fish, and a wide 
variety of waterfowl and shorebirds, including the endangered least tern. For 
information, call (310) 306-5078.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; CLINTON 
AND WHITEWATER: 'IT'S POLITICS'

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Whitewater controversy is threatening President Clinton's legislative 
agenda. We asked some Southern Californians if Clinton is getting what he 
deserves or if the Republicans and other critics are ganging up on him? JOSEPH 
CHESS 
</P>
<P>
 Owner, Canoga Jeep Eagle, Chatsworth 
</P>
<P>
 I think probably they didn't use good moral judgment in the beginning and that 
seems to have mushroomed. I don't think there's much there, but I think the 
fact that they didn't use good judgment in clarifying the situation immediately 
has cost him. When you don't use good judgment, you're open for any kind of 
flak. JOHN GLYNN 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal bond broker, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 They are ganging up on him, but he is getting what he deserves. And that's not 
for what he may or may not have done. He is getting what he deserves because he 
hasn't learned from the mistakes of past presidents. He should come clean and 
fully disclose the facts. PATRICIA TURNIER 
</P>
<P>
 Painter, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 I am a moderate Republican as are many of us in Laguna. But my impression is, 
frankly, that there is too much attention paid by the press to the peccadilloes 
of people in public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Clinton may be quite guilty, slightly guilty or not guilty at all, I 
think the press should get away from people's personal lives and concentrate 
instead on how wrong-headed many of Clinton's policies are. DAHLONEGA CRUZ 
</P>
<P>
 Writer, West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 What I find really ironic is that 20 years ago, Richard Nixon walked away from 
the Oval Office. Ever since then, the Republicans have been sniffing at the 
Democrats' laundry basket. And, frankly, the only thing the two have in common 
is H2O. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that the only people really interested in Whitewater are politicians, 
specifically Republicans, and the media. I don't think the public at large, 
including myself, is interested. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't care about what's in Clinton's 1040, I'm interested in what's in my 
tax returns. I'm concerned about crime, education, health issues, the economy 
and world peace. If the allegations and speculation advance to congressional 
hearings, then perhaps I will rise to the edge of my seat and take notice. JEFF 
MAZIE 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance executive, Burbank 
</P>
<P>
 It's politics. The Democrats did it to the Republicans with the Silverado 
Savings & Loan issue (looking into the role of Neil Bush, son of former 
President George Bush, in the failure of the Colorado thrift) and the 
Republicans are getting back at the Democrats this time. I think it's 
undeserved but, again, that's what happens inside the Beltway.  
</P>
<P>
 CAROLINE ROSS 
</P>
<P>
 Rehabilitation counselor, 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When this first came up, I thought this is just another Republican tactic to 
find anything wrong with the Clintons, especially with Hillary. Now, I'm not 
quite sure what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is odd that the Clintons didn't come forward sooner about the whole thing. 
I want to believe the best about Clinton because I think he's doing a good job. 
I think Hillary is doing a good job. And I look at his Republican critics and 
wonder about their integrity. It's just puzzling to me that it has gone on so 
long.

'I STARTED OUT PRETTY MUCH AS A GOFER'

By Interviewed by Rip Rense for The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ALEX PILMER 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer, 27, graduate of Loyola Law School, has been with Buchalter, Nemer, 
Fields & Younger law firm in Los Angeles since last October specializing in 
banking and finance 
</P>
<P>
 When I was in college, I got a job in a law firm, starting out pretty much as 
a gofer. I got more responsibility and the guy I worked for liked what I 
did.When I started law school, I worked at another law firm where I could work 
fewer hours and continued to be a law clerk. I did that for six years, and I 
think that being on my resume is why I got a job. 
</P>
<P>
 I did what was probably a very common way of getting a job 10 years ago. At 
law schools during the fall of your next-to-last year, law firms come on campus 
and interview people for summer jobs. After doing the 10-week summer program, 
they decide of those people who they're going to make job offers to. So I went 
through that process and got a job offer for the summer at Buchalter. I was 
fortunate because I discovered there was a kind of anti-night-school bias at 
law firms. They kind of view them as second-class students, which is unfair 
because we go through the exact admission process, exact same classes, exact 
same professors. There's no difference at all. I think night students have it 
much tougher: Most worked full-time and went to school at night.

'THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET GOOD GRADES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled for The Times by Erik Hamilton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheating is on the rise in the nation's high schools, according to a survey by 
Who's Who in America. We asked Southern California students enrolled in honors 
courses how widespread the problem is here.  
</P>
<P>
 EMIGDIO CERVANTES 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 17, Santa Ana High School, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know of anybody in the honors program who cheats. I know that cheating 
is pretty widespread in the non-honors classes. I know it's pretty easy. But 
for myself, and I think for those who are taking honors classes, it's a matter 
of pride. I want to get a good grade based on what I know. I don't want to get 
it by cheating. JONATHAN BIALON 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 17, Rosemead High School, Rosemead 
</P>
<P>
 I would have to say at least 80% to 90% of the students cheat. It ranges from 
cheating on tests to copying homework. But I think most of the cheating is 
confined to the lower-division classes. That's not to say there isn't cheating 
going on in honors classes. But I don't see it. Besides, I think most of the 
kids who are in honors classes realize that if they do cheat, it will come back 
to them when they go to college. To me, it just isn't worth it. KELLY MATZEN 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 17, Rosemead High 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of cheating going on in school. It's widespread and it's not 
just in lower-division classes. I know some kids have a lot of pressure from 
home, so they are driven to get that good grade no matter what. As a freshman, 
you can really feel the pressure and sometimes cheating is the only option, 
especially if you want to get into a good college. Kids put a lot of pressure 
on themselves. But I'd have to say that a lot of that pressure comes from the 
home. DEBORA HOEHNE 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 17, Polytechnic High School, Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 I'd have to say that cheating is widespread, but only in those classes where 
teachers let it happen. In the honors classes, it's also there. Some students 
are not willing to take chances and rely on their study habits. There's a lot 
of pressure to get good grades so you can get into a good school. I do not 
cheat. I work hard and study hard. Sometimes I don't do as well as I'd like. 
But I don't beat myself up when I don't do well on a test. I tell myself it's 
OK. But for some, getting a good grade, no matter how you get it, is the most 
important thing in the world. JOEL JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 18, Estancia High School, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Cheating happens at all levels. The degree of cheating, though, is worse in 
the non-honors classes. I never had to cheat; I'm too stubborn to let it 
happen. But those who do cheat, and I'm talking about the honor students, they 
cheat because of the pressure that parents put on them. Sometimes the material 
is too hard. And if some students fail, their world comes crashing down on top 
of them. I was taught that cheating was wrong. But I was also taught that 
failure is not the worstthing that can happen to you. KAREN HELMUTH  
</P>
<P>
 Senior, 17, Estancia High 
</P>
<P>
 I have friends who cheat. And I have to say that I've cheated. In my freshman 
year, I put all this pressure on myself. I had to do well. I think I've matured 
though. And I understand that hard work and study are usually the answer. Now, 
when one of my friends cheat, I hate it. I think to myself, 'Hear I studied 
hard and this person didn't and he got a good grade.' But I can understand why 
they cheat. But I also have to say that sometimes teachers make it easy for 
kids to cheat. The temptation is there, so kids cheat.

'THIS ISN'T A GAME'; 'IF WE ALLOW DANGEROUS PEOPLE BACK ON THE STREET TOO SOON 
SOMEONE WILL DIE AND IT MIGHT BE YOUR CHILD OR MINE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO GREENE, Leo Greene is a broadcast journalist in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was waiting for my two young sons to finish their ice creams when I saw the 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 We had been making a Saturday afternoon of it at a middle-class park in San 
Dimas. The park was crowded with children in play areas, picnickers and 
basketball players bumping and panting back and forth across a concrete court. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been watching the young man for some time. His gang attire, including 
the neatly pressed super-baggy trousers, seemed out of place. So did his cold 
demeanor. For a good while he had been sitting at a park bench staring at 
another young man, a clean-cut guy of about the same age shooting baskets by 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, a second young Latino in obvious gang attire joined the man 
at the bench and together they beckoned to the black man. Putting down his 
basketball the young guy on the basketball court walked over. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't hear their words, but the body language spoke hostility. Suddenly 
the young basketball player turned and ran. One of the two men pulled out a 
small, chrome gun. They ran after the young black man. I saw the weapon being 
aimed and heard gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the young guy escaped injury, and sheriff's deputies arrived in 
time to make an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days later I was down at the sheriff's station going through pages of 
photographs. The investigators were pleased when I made correct 
identifications. They said I would be a key witness in the case. I was eager to 
help the authorities. What those two young men did enraged me. I felt as if 
these two gangsters with the cheap chrome handgun had threatened my own 
children's lives as well as the lives of all the people in the park and in that 
neighborhood. These two were waving a stick of death in the midst of dozens of 
innocent people and because of something broken or missing in their moral 
character they didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, this experience brings to bear several issues involving the criminal 
justice system, crime prevention and the utter failure of our political leaders 
to act in our best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes and you're out" is the latest addition to a patchwork 
sentencing system. It's one more unstudied knee-jerk fix that works well in a 
pre-election speech but will probably end up accomplishing little or causing 
more problems than it cures. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong. We desperately need to get tough, especially on the 
incorrigibly violent. 
</P>
<P>
 But why fix a flat tire when the whole damn car is broken? 
</P>
<P>
 The young men with the gun in that San Dimas park will undoubtedly be 
unaffected by the three strikes law. Whether they're dealt with as juveniles or 
tried as adults, I'll wager the punishment won't fit their crime. 
</P>
<P>
 As for their crime, let me spell it out. 
</P>
<P>
 They carried a concealed weapon in a public park; they handled the gun near 
the vulnerable bodies of young children; they used a pistol so cheap and 
unreliable that it can only fire round bullets and might discharge if dropped; 
they fired a deadly weapon down a street where children, mothers and fathers 
live, and they tried to take the life of another human. 
</P>
<P>
 For such wildly criminal behavior these would-be assassins need to be put away 
for a long time. It's not a matter of strikes. This isn't a game. Experience 
tells us that if we allow these people back on the street too soon someone will 
die and it might be your child or mine. The point I'm getting to is that we 
need to comprehensively re-examine our entire sentencing system and 
intelligently establish new criteria and reorder the priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, dangerous people need to be taken off the street until they are 
no longer dangerous -- if and when that time comes. Second, people who are not 
dangerous must be punished, but their prison terms should be shorter. That 
sounds stupidly simple, but our system isn't doing that. Third, when it comes 
to punishment we need to come up with cheaper but still-effective ways to deal 
with nonviolent criminals so that we can afford to keep the dangerous people 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The next order of business involves guns. That inexpensive "Saturday night 
special" used by those two almost-killers is the favorite weapon of young 
gangsters. The weapons are cheap, plentiful and hang inconspicuously in the 
deep pockets of baggy trousers. 
</P>
<P>
 How do kids get them? They steal them or buy them from licensed gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The solutions are obvious: Ban the cheap little gangster guns that intelligent 
gun owners wouldn't buy anyway; next, make federal firearms licenses harder and 
more expensive to get; make sure new gun dealers are in conformance with local 
laws, and use the additional money to better monitor the dealers. Bills are 
pending. Get them passed. Finally there is the issue that involves our children 
and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminologists warn us that the threat of punishment is a weak deterrent. I've 
spent a good deal of time with gang members and I know it to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 As a society we can no longer afford to stand by wailing indignantly about 
unparented children and moral decay. Efforts in preventing crime intersect with 
our need to improve education. The answer lies in early intervention. If we can 
reach the lost children between the ages of 3 and 6 with educational and 
ethical indoctrination -- including activities, creative play, reading to 
children and exposure to positive role models -- I am convinced we can change 
things for the better in every way. We would reduce crime. Our children would 
be better prepared to enter school. We would ultimately save billions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if we choose not to act, we will continue to pay the high 
price of wasted and dependent lives, violent crime and expensive and crowded 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't turn back the clock for the two young gang members with the cheap gun 
in that San Dimas park. 
</P>
<P>
 But we can change the future.

WILL THE REAL JANET RENO PLEASE STAND UP?; LET'S STRAIGHTEN OUT FEDERAL 
SENTENCING LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The oddities and growing inequities embodied in federal criminal sentencing 
laws long have troubled civil libertarians and, more recently, a handful of 
outspoken federal judges. However, their opinions have counted for little when 
stacked against congressional majorities bent on federalizing yet more crimes, 
and against an electorate hopping mad over street crime. 
</P>
<P>
 ABSURD ANOMALIES: Determined to fight drug trafficking and violent crime, 
Congress, beginning in 1984, progressively has stripped from federal trial 
judges their traditional discretion in sentencing criminal offenders. The 
so-called mandatory minimum prison sentences that now attach to specific 
criminal offenses do not easily square with our notions of rational punishment. 
Sentences like five years without parole for possession (including possession 
for personal use only) of more than five grams -- or one-fifth of an ounce -- 
of crack cocaine. Or 10 years without parole for having any role in the 
distribution of more than 50 grams of crack -- a sentence well above the range 
specified in the guidelines for solicitation of murder. These sentences must be 
doubled, to 10 and 20 years respectively, for any defendant with a previous 
drug felony conviction, no matter how long ago or how minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Conviction for trafficking in LSD that is on blotter paper carries a lighter 
sentence than does conviction for selling the same amount of LSD dissolved in a 
sugar cube. Why? Because the cube weighs more and the total weight figures into 
the computation of the prison sentence. And it goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, these weird and rigid guidelines have now filled federal 
prisons with nonviolent offenders. A recent Justice Department study found that 
one-fifth of federal inmates committed mostly nonviolent, first-time drug 
offenses. In some cases, violent offenders have been released to make room for 
petty drug dealers or teen-agers who made one bad mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 TURNED-OFF JUDGES: A critical mass of federal judges of all ideological 
stripes is voicing alarm at these consequences. In recent years, several 
prominent district court judges, including Terry J. Hatter Jr. of Los Angeles 
and Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn, have announced they will no longer hear drug 
cases when they take senior status, leaving these cases to younger colleagues. 
Their isolated voices were amplified earlier this month by U.S. Supreme Court 
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy -- not exactly a liberal. In congressional hearings, 
Kennedy said, " . . . I am in agreement with most judges in the federal system 
that mandatory minimums are an imprudent, unwise and often unjust mechanism for 
sentencing." 
</P>
<P>
 As Congress debates the crime bills now before it, some of which define new 
federal crimes and call for tougher punishments, conspicuous by her silence is 
U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, whose Justice Department is still reeling from the 
resignations of its No. 2 and No. 3 officials. Reno long has been critical -- 
courageously so -- of the rigid sentencing laws, but she has kept too quiet 
since joining the Clinton Administration, which is taking a hard line on crime. 
Her moment is now, if she can put aside her personnel crisis. Justice Kennedy's 
comments put her squarely in the spotlight.

 Re the Church of England's ordination of women priests: 
</P>
<P>
 "Bravissimae" to the 32 women who followed the call in their hearts to 
priestly ministry. Their fidelity in the face of opposition and bitterness is 
truly inspiring.And congratulations to the Church of England for having the 
courage to so painstakingly discern such a controversial and important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Church of England's decision to ordain women into the priesthood came 
after decades of listening to the spirit found in Scripture, in tradition, and 
in the hearts of the faithful. This is why these women's ordination, as painful 
as it is for the dissenters to accept, can only bring blessings to a community 
that believes as Jesus did, that spiritual authority and holiness originate not 
in maleness or femaleness, but in faith in God, and in love of God and 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a cause for great celebration that this basic spiritual truth is 
complementing the Anglican priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, one day soon, the 400,000-member Roman Catholic priesthood will 
also realize this truth.

BATES ON FARRAKHAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when Louis Farrakhan is steadily escalating his racist rhetoric, 
Karen Grigsby Bates calls the Nation of Islam leader a "creation of American 
racism" and says, "If race were not an ongoing problem, he wouldn't exist" 
(Commentary, March 11). It's a nice touch to describe Farrakhan not as a 
producer of racism but as its creation. But in justifying or excusing 
Farrakhan's bigotry because it constitutes only a small portion of a generally 
positive program, Bates opens the door to other bigots who may have a cause. 
Whatever became of condemning bigotry because it is wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Bates applauds Farrakhan's "efforts to make black neighborhoods safer" while 
"lament(ing) the parts of him that are anti-Semitic." Bates' applause was 
echoed in the thousands of votes David Duke received for speaking to issues of 
white alienation. In suggesting that the public should overlook or ignore the 
incendiary racism and anti-Semitic scapegoating that are an inseparable part of 
Farrakhan's message, Bates seems to suggest that Farrakhan's bigotry is 
deserving of special consideration. Is she concerned that criticism of 
Farrakhan's anti-Semitism will subvert his efforts "to persuade young men 
dangling on the precipice of self-destruction to commit themselves to a 
communal good"? 
</P>
<P>
 It is shameful that Bates can only "lament" and not condemn when Farrakhan 
engages in anti-Semitism and attacks "degenerate gays," white "devils," etc. 
Months ago, Farrakhan's apologists claimed he was moderating his message and 
becoming more tolerant. No such claims have been made, however, since he 
televised his Jewish conspiracy theories just last month. Now his defenders 
acknowledge his bigotry, but take issue with those who would remember that the 
civil rights struggle was based upon speaking out against bigotry without 
temporizing.

<P>
 I am appalled at Bates' suggestion that we simply accept the implied racism 
and anti-Semitism of Farrakhan's rhetoric as an idiosyncrasy, and that his 
positive message to American blacks outweighs whatever hateful and anti-white 
statements sprinkled therein. Does Bates then conclude that the world in the 
1930s was correct to ignore Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitism because he was so 
brilliantly successful in bringing Germany from the depths of economic 
depression to global power? 
</P>
<P>
 If this Farrakhan controversy proves anything it is that the longer blacks 
keep looking for national black leadership to solve their problems, the further 
backward we will go. We don't need black and Jewish leaders to sit down at a 
table to discuss our differences; all we need is for you, me and everyone else 
to respect each other and simply do our best to get along. What we don't need, 
from Farrakhan or Bates, is a justification for more hatred. 
</P>

<P>
 Bates got certain things right in her analysis.  
</P>
<P>
 Her estimate of African and African American deaths during the slave trade era 
(13 million), compared to Jewish losses in the Holocaust, is reasonable -- 
unlike Farrakhan followers' claims that 6 million Jews did not die, but that 
600 million blacks (according to Khalid Abdul Muhammad) lost their lives as a 
consequence of the slave trade. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also undoubtedly right that the crux of black-Jewish conflict these 
days involves the African American middle class -- not the inner-city poor, 
with whom American Jews have insignificant contact, either positive or 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
 My difficulty is with her apologetic explanation that, for middle-class 
blacks, identifying with Farrakhan is "vicariously liberating." I suppose that 
identifying with the Hebrew children in bondage to Pharaoh was "vicariously 
liberating" for enslaved African Americans -- except that such an 
identification ultimately contributed to real freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who go down the road with Farrakhan are heading toward the dead end of a 
resegregated American society, which is the Nation of Islam's longstanding 
goal.

<P>
 Bates' piece blaming "American racism" for black acceptance of Farrahkan and 
his Nation of Islam message is a cop-out; that "to begin the dialogue, we must 
come to the table as equals," a myopic view of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If we are equal there would be no need for the dialogue and developing 
programs to erase "American racism." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor should the parties "around the table" be but black and white. It has to be 
all of us, individuals and groups from the mosaic of American culture and 
society. We have an equal stake in the outcome.

TONIC FOR ACHING U.S. LABOR RELATIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The relationship between U.S. employers and employees is in the middle of a 
historic shift whose outcome is far from revealed. The labor market certainties 
of the booming 1950s and '60s have been replaced with ambivalent and unforeseen 
labor force developments, such as those that President Clinton and leaders of 
the other major industrial nations tried to puzzle out at their jobs summit in 
Detroit last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States seemingly permanent changes include leaner work forces. 
People with the right skills can pick and choose, but it's tough to say what 
such skills will be a decade from now. Many companies with smaller managements 
need workers to take more responsibility, but workers who don't trust 
management are loath to take on that kind of accountability. Manufacturers need 
employee concessions to stay competitive, but no one wants to give up a nickel 
without some guarantee that his or her job won't be moved away. Union 
membership in the private sector has declined from a high of 45% in the 1950s 
to about 12% now, and no proven model for labor relations has emerged to 
stabilize the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The logical referee in these difficult times is the National Labor Relations 
Board, whose task is to enforce fairness in labor-management relations. Labor 
had little good to say about the NLRB during the Bush and Reagan years. 
Unionists dated their reversal of fortune to the day President Ronald Reagan 
ordered the replacement of striking air traffic controllers in 1981. Later, 
said labor leaders, firings of union activists went unpunished by the NLRB and 
companies were allowed to endlessly dispute union elections. To his credit, 
President George Bush named three relative moderates to the five-member NLRB 
board, appointments that started the pendulum in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The NLRB was paralyzed for several months, without a leader, while President 
Clinton's nomination of William B. Gould IV as chairman was stalled short of 
confirmation. Gould has stated his belief in unions, and although he has worked 
for management some business interests have bitterly opposed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, finally, this experienced labor lawyer has been sworn in, the first 
African American to head the NLRB. He has said that his chief job will be 
"fostering a more cooperative relationship between labor and management." The 
harsh words spoken on both sides in his confirmation battle will have to be 
forgotten first. 
</P>
<P>
 The old contentiousness between big unions and big companies surely wasn't the 
best model, but neither are fear and instability among workers. A revived NLRB 
could help define a new relationship, which needn't be lovingly hand in hand, 
but how about civil and equal?

NEED FOR VIRTUOUS CAPITALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The excerpt of Michael Novak's remarks on winning the Templeton Prize 
identifies the dangers for a democratic capitalist society adrift of its moral 
and ethical moorings ("The Urgent Need for Virtuous Capitalism," Commentary, 
March 13). However, he neglects to offer a viable intellectual basis for the 
"virtuous cultural awakening" required for free societies to survive. The 
strength of Weber's "Protestant Ethic" is founded on individual responsibility 
and accountability. The theory of the firm does not dispel this maxim. It is 
when human associations and institutions depart from individual responsibility 
and accountability that society's moral bearings begin to fray. Such is the 
root of the tyranny of bureaucracy, the torpor of socialism, the hubris of 
unchecked political power and the corrupted ethics of free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs and benefits of human action must be internalized and borne by the 
individual actor whenever and wherever possible in order to promote prudent 
social behavior. This is an economic, legal and moral basis for justice in a 
society that seeks to ensure individual liberty and individual preference. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL HARRINGTON 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Novak has his work cut out for him if he is going to reconcile 
Catholic theology with capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not that it is impossible to imagine moral ways of acting 
within capitalism if one should choose to do so; people can always choose (and 
some have chosen) to act morally. The problem is that the system of capitalism 
itself does not require moral action outside the context of its own operation. 
Honoring contracts, for example is "morally necessary" for capitalism to work, 
but having economic hardship for someone else result from one's actions has no 
moral force in capitalism. The potential problem with Adam Smith's "invisible 
hand" has always been that it might crush us. 
</P>
<P>
 In reference to Novak's description of "the distinctive capitalist social 
invention, the business firm held together by voluntary consent and teamwork," 
this is more of a political economist's ideal than a reliable generalization 
about the real world. It is possible to see one's work as being part of a team, 
but the concept of mutual loyalty and interdependence between worker and 
company in fact only fully exists in those economic situations which are 
controlled markets rather than free markets. 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely in paternalistic, mercantilist economies, the sterling example 
of which is Japan, that such relationships can be pursued. I don't see how this 
squares with Novak's otherwise laissez-faire description of how capitalism 
properly works.

WHY WE NEED MORE WOMEN COPS; LAPD: STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY ARE JUST AS 
EFFECTIVE AS MEN, RESORT LESS TO EXCESSIVE FORCE AND HAVE BETTER PEOPLE SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZEV YAROSLAVSKY, Zev Yaroslavsky represents parts of the Westside and San 
Fernando Valley on the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A debate is raging on a proposal to increase the number of women officers in 
the Los Angeles Police Department, even though study after study has 
demonstrated that women make good cops. Furthermore, as a group, they're better 
than men at avoiding excessive use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1973 study of female police-officer performance in Washington, D.C., found 
that women were dealing with just as many violent or unruly suspects as the 
men, and were responding to similar types of calls. The study found that "there 
were no reported incidents that cast doubts on the women's abilities to perform 
patrol work satisfactorily." Further, the women "seemed more effective than the 
men in defusing potentially violent situations." 
</P>
<P>
 In a study of all 3,515 complaints filed against New York City police officers 
in 1989, women received fewer complaints, were less inclined to use deadly 
force and were involved in fewer shooting incidents, even though they were 
involved in just as many violent confrontations as the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Los Angeles, the Christopher Commission found that "female LAPD 
officers are involved in excessive use of force at rates substantially below 
those of male officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Author and former police officer Joseph Wambaugh knows perhaps more about the 
psychology and culture of policing than any opinion-maker of our day. He 
believes that police departments should be 50% female or more. In 1992 he 
wrote: "It is no longer even remotely sensible to assert that size and strength 
are prerequisites for police service . . . ." In 1991, he told The Times: 
"Police work is not about physical altercations, it's not about shooting people 
. . . . It's about talking to people. Women are awfully good at talking to 
people. They're awfully good at problem-solving and that's all police work is. 
The very best cops are the ones who can get people to talk to them. Women are 
eminently better qualified at that." In other words, women make good cops. By 
hiring more of them, we can reduce our liability in lawsuits alleging excessive 
force by officers, which, according to the Christopher Commission, cost the 
city more than $20 million between 1986 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 We can also halt the marginalization of our female officers, and perhaps put a 
stop to the cop-on-cop sexual-harassment lawsuits that over the last several 
years have cost the taxpayers $400,000 -- and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it is in the city's policing and financial interest to hire more 
qualified women for the LAPD. The motion that I and Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg have introduced would increase the annual police hiring goal for women 
from 30%, as it stands now, to "work-force gender parity," or 43.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's debunk some of the counter-arguments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Increasing the female hiring goal will not lower standards. I have called 
for "validating" our admissions testing process to ensure that it's 
job-related. It is unfair -- and illegal -- to require job-seekers to adhere to 
a standard that has nothing to do with the job. We currently require applicants 
to scale a 6-foot wall. But once they've been hired, they never again have to 
demonstrate this skill. In fact, the LAPD has no ongoing physical fitness 
requirements or training of any kind. Applicants -- and police officers -- 
should be physically fit. But we shouldn't employ a standard that has nothing 
to do with the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * Our proposal will not create a "quota system" for women nor risk a lawsuit 
by white men. Our proposal has nothing to do with mandatory quotas. Instead, it 
sets a goal, which, according to the city attorney, is entirely lawful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adding more women will not lower department morale. This same argument was 
made 50 years ago against racial integration of the armed forces, and even 
against integration of LAPD. It was wrong then, and it's wrong now. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women officers do not leave the department more quickly. The attrition rates 
for women and men are nearly identical. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women want these jobs. It's true that most women have not been brought up to 
think of policing as a career. If women are made to feel wanted and respected 
in the department, they will apply and succeed as cops. If the city insists on 
perpetuating the myth that women aren't up to the job and are therefore not 
wanted, then indeed women won't apply. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Police Department that is balanced between men and women will do 
much good for our city. It will reduce excessive-force incidents and advance 
the goal of community-based policing. It will improve the department's response 
to domestic-violence and sexual-assault cases, which make up a significant 
percentage of its calls. It will lower the incidence of sexual harassment and 
discrimination among officers and reduce the city's financial liability. It 
will produce a police department that reflects the face of our society -- and 
that's the best kind of a police force to have.

CAN HAYDEN SUCCEED WHERE SINCLAIR FAILED?; POLITICS: THE CHICAGO SEVEN ALUMNUS 
IS A DEFINITE FACTOR IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE SCOTT, Joe Scott, a Los Angeles-based political consultant, was 
communications director for Mayor Richard Riordan's 1993 campaign. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sixty years ago, Depression-era California voters rallied behind the End 
Poverty in California platform of an unlikely candidate for governor, Socialist 
Upton Sinclair. He won the Democratic nomination by a landslide.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the talk is about whether the Democrats can produce, in a recessionary 
era, another victor from the left with the populist appeal of yesterday's 
muckraking author and pamphleteer -- and who, unlike Sinclair, can win a 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising the progressive banner will be Tom Hayden, 1960s Vietnam War resister 
and New Left leader, 1970s guerrilla-style activist and insurgent challenger 
for a U.S. Senate seat, 1980s and '90s assemblyman and state senator. While the 
odds are against his making the November ballot, Hayden has positioned himself 
as the messenger of reform against the corrupt power of money and lobbyists in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether Hayden, aping former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown and 
businessman Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential campaign, can make his "Reform 
in '94" message resonate with the salience of hot-button issues like crime, 
jobs and education.  
</P>
<P>
 Hayden has tried to downplay his chance at winning the Democratic nomination. 
But the feeling among political cognoscenti in both parties that state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown has the nomination wrapped up has eroded with the 
growing perception that she lacks core beliefs. Now, the specter of a focused 
campaign by Hayden, a proved vote-getter adept at attracting free media 
attention, raises the possibility of pivotal, three-way debates that include 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite insisting that he will not run paid radio and TV spots, Hayden, a 
multimillionaire thanks to his huge divorce settlement from Jane Fonda in 1989, 
says he may use his own money to buy 15- to 30-minute "infomercials." He 
personally spent an estimated $750,000 to win a state Senate seat in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 One has only to recall the success of the political-reform campaign of Jerry 
Brown in 1974 to understand that the dynamics of state Democratic politics in a 
crowded primary historically tend to favor the most populist candidate. A 
similar developing scenario suggests that Hayden's uphill battle to win the 
nomination may depend on igniting core liberal constituencies currently soft on 
the bland campaigns of "New Democrats" Brown and Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's anti-Establishment dream of the 1960s remains unrequited. His 
candidacy will fragment the race and cut the margin needed to win the primary 
to perhaps 37%. If Hayden is able to mobilize his constituency, he could 
seriously weaken Brown, whose campaign has had a major shake-up in recent days 
in search of a new message. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's bland campaign slogan, "Enough is enough," while comforting to an 
upper-middle-class constituency -- notably women who identify with her -- was 
not specific enough to ignite her candidacy among liberals, whose vote in the 
Democratic primary carries far greater weight than in the general election. And 
the largest portion of her supporters are young blacks and Latinos, susceptible 
to Hayden's populist rhetoric.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the good-luck admonition to his sister by Jerry Brown had an 
uncharacteristic vagueness. He declared he was glad Hayden was putting the 
issue of political reform "front and center," then added: "I'm certainly urging 
my sister to get out front on political reform." That raises the tantalizing 
question of whether there will be a tactical shift to the left in Kathleen 
Brown's campaign to blunt Hayden's rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Hayden remains an unpredictable wild card, Brown, who leads Gov. 
Pete Wilson in the polls -- will be forced to campaign harder and spend more 
general-election reserves to nail down the nomination. Even repelling Hayden, 
Brown would still start against Wilson substantially weakened by the populist 
assault. Remember 1976 and Sen. John V. Tunney, who never recovered from the 
Chicago Seven alumnus' pummeling and lost to maverick Republican S.I. Hayakawa. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, Hayden's mischief in roiling the Democratic primary is serious 
political manna. With the luckiest of bounces, he might even draw Sinclair's 
heir as his November opponent.

PERSPECTIVE ON ASIA; ITS NEIGHBORS WANT A STRONG CHINA; MODERNIZATION MEANS 
MARKETS, SOCIAL STABILITY AND LESS RELIANCE ON MILITARY MIGHT. BUT THE U.S. 
MUST STAY INVOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHEL OKSENBERG, Michel Oksenberg is president of the East-West Center in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Tokyo and Seoul to Canberra, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, one finds a 
broad consensus about six points concerning China. Given the wide range of 
views among Asian thinkers on most issues, this consensus is striking.  
</P>
<P>
 First, it is generally believed that the underlying fundamentals for China's 
continued, rapid economic growth are sound: a populace with a propensity to 
save and hence a high rate of capital accumulation; an entrepreneurial 
tradition; a basically sound natural-resource endowment; a leadership that has 
been deft in guiding the economy; the magnetic pull of the region as a whole; a 
propitious international setting, and the assistance available from Hong Kong, 
Taiwan and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and North America. Of course, 
major uncertainties and constraints exist as well, and Asian leaders and China 
specialists differ on the severity of China's domestic difficulties, though 
these are generally seen to be short- and medium-term impediments. 
</P>
<P>
 A second part of the Asian consensus is that the entire region would suffer if 
China's modernization failed, if China suffered the chaos that Russia is now 
experiencing, or if major social instability and unrest occurred. Disorder 
would spill across China's border, certainly affecting Hong Kong and probably 
Taiwan, and prompting substantial population migration to other destinations as 
well. More important, because most Asians have begun to view China's dynamic 
economy as a major locomotive for regional growth, they have concluded that a 
massive political and economic failure in China would damage their own future 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, and most important, if China does continue its rapid economic 
development, the eventual outcome is something Asians anticipate with a mixture 
of apprehension and optimism. They recognize that China will be a formidable 
market competitor, and that the next generation of leaders -- no matter who 
they are -- will seek military might as the economy permits. That is, in the 
view of most Asian leaders, China is determined to be a complete power, 
transforming the strategic map of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the China-watchers' optimism, that springs from some self-confidence 
that China's economic growth will provide the region with attractive markets 
and investment opportunities, and that China can be woven into webs of economic 
interdependence before it attains genuine force projection capabilities. There 
is also some confidence that the countries on China's periphery, from Japan and 
Korea to India, have the wherewithal -- assisted by America's continued 
military presence in the region -- to balance and counter assertive tendencies 
that may emanate from Beijing. However, the Asians also feel confident that 
they will not have to subordinate their China policies to the dictates of the 
United States, as was the case in the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth point of broad consensus among Asian leaders centers on an 
awareness of Chinese pride and Beijing's prickly sensitivity to issues of 
sovereignty. Most Asians will studiously avoid gratuitously insulting Beijing's 
leaders, and they will distance themselves from such affronts by others. Many 
Asian leaders are even encouraging Beijing to resist American efforts to impose 
our values on China. In this regard, many identify somewhat with China's 
reaction to the American human-rights agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 This leads to the fifth point: the Asians' desire for the United States to 
sustain a constructive relationship with China. They recognize that an 
effective strategic dialogue and an extensive economic relationship between 
China and the United States are essential to maintenance of stability in Korea, 
a peaceful evolution of the Taiwan issue and the continued prosperity of 
Southeast Asia. They recognize that simultaneously good relations among China, 
Japan and the United States are key to the entire region's stability; they fear 
that tensions among these major powers would force the others to choose sides. 
They agree that the continued American presence and positive 
Sino-American-Japanese relations since the mid-1970s have brought unprecedented 
stability and prosperity to the region.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Asia's leaders are prepared to diverge from U.S. policy if the United 
States ends up with an adversarial relationship with China. They feel that the 
accomplishments of the government of China in the past decade, despite the many 
blemishes and the tragedy of June 4, 1989, merit respect rather than scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 I am convinced that if the United States retreats from the historical task of 
incorporating China into the emerging Asia-Pacific community of nations, then 
those countries -- Japan, Korea, Australia, the ASEAN states, Burma, Pakistan 
and possibly even India, Vietnam and Russia -- will pursue that task without 
us. They have too much at stake to abandon the effort that most of them began, 
with American encouragement, in the 1970s and '80s; they feel that the strategy 
of engagement is working. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are now debating whether to link extension of China's favored trade 
status to its human-rights record. But the broader strategic choice for the 
United States is whether it wishes to continue the path of engagement pursued 
since 1972 or isolate itself from the China policies being pursued by our 
allies and friends in the region. The trade penalty would push the United 
States in the latter direction.

A DANCE TO OUR MICRO-SELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEBAN, Richard Beban writes about the environment for PS 
Enterprises, a public relations and environmental policy firm based in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cartoonist Jules Feiffer occasionally draws a near-anorexic, often depressed, 
but nonetheless resilient ballerina who proposes a dance to this subject or 
that. Sometimes she ends with a pirouette of joy, sometimes she slumps to the 
floor in a posture of abject defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 With a bow to Feiffer, and more than a genuflection to Whitman, I propose a 
dance to spring, to the season of life's renewal, that is also a dance to 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mean our macro-selves, the meat-puppets who slam-dance their way 
through the urban landscape, sometimes clad in two-ton chunks of armor, 
sometimes wrapped only in the callus of indifference, the protective carapace 
we wear to distance ourselves from each other and our fears. 
</P>
<P>
 I propose instead a dance to our micro-selves, a dance to our dance. For we 
are a dance. Every one of our cells is a living, pulsating, undulating 
protoplasmic Nijinsky. Some of our cells thump to the steady beat of rap, some 
glide to a pavane, some measure their lives in the complex percussions of the 
gamelan. Some dance together as organs, others dance alone.  
</P>
<P>
 I propose a dance to spring on a cellular level, and, to begin, I'd like to 
sashay across the floor and tap on the shoulder of a phytoplankton, our 
one-celled cousins who boogie in profusion just offshore, in Santa Monica Bay 
and Long Beach Harbor and in the great oceans beyond. Because the concentration 
of salts in both seawater and blood are almost identical, and because, 
millennia ago, our unicellular ancestors were themselves born of the sea, any 
dance to the phytoplankton is, in truth, a dance to ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 I celebrate their importance: Through a process that can only be called magic 
-- and so much of "science" is just inventing names for the magic -- they 
engage in photosynthesis, turning sunlight into food and oxygen far more 
successfully than the ancient alchemists' lofty promises of gold from base 
metals. 
</P>
<P>
 I celebrate their gifts: Oxygen, for one -- somewhere between 40% and 60% of 
the oxygen we breathe comes not from the forests on land, but from the forests 
of phytoplankton in the sea. Food, for another -- they are the bottom of the 
aquatic food chain, prey for the organisms next in size, etcetera, etcetera, 
until the life they wrest from sunlight metamorphoses into the flesh of the sea 
creatures and plants that feed us. 
</P>
<P>
 I celebrate their delicacy: The marvelous process of photosynthesis that is 
their gift can take place only in the first 33 feet of offshore water, give or 
take a foot. Sunlight cannot penetrate below that level, nor can photosynthesis 
take place in turbid water, or too-cold-water, or too-warm or too-salty water. 
</P>
<P>
 I celebrate their resilience: They flourish in the face of the continuous 
assault of our urban runoff -- that's the bureaucratic name for the tens of 
millions of gallons of excess lawn and car-wash water that daily conveys every 
manner of toxic pesticides, detergents, automotive fluids, pet waste, 
polystyrene and just plain trash from our streets into storm drains and, 
untreated, into the phytoplanktons' living room. 
</P>
<P>
 They survive our "treated" human waste, which we delicately call "solids," 
that can overenrich their aquatic environment and cause them to bloom 
magnificently, then die of oxygen depletion, gone like a supernova consuming 
itself. And they survive the chlorine we dump in to purify our solids. 
</P>
<P>
 They survive our fires and our floods, our development practices that denude 
hillsides and wash tons of topsoil into the water, often making it too cloudy 
for photosynthesis. 
</P>
<P>
 I celebrate their survival and, as I bow to my phytoplankton partner in thanks 
for this moment of terpsichorean bliss, I bow as well in a short prayer that we 
humans -- prideful agglomerations of bacteria that we are -- have not gone so 
far as to irreparably damage the gracile web of life that cradles us all in its 
strands. 
</P>
<P>
 If you'd care to join me, find a quiet spot, sit and listen. Hear the throb of 
blood in your ears, the slow, steady, reassuring rhythm of the tough muscle 
cells of your heart at work, propelling the rich blood cells that carry the 
nourishing oxygen that began in the sea. Compare that rhythmic sound to the 
tidal cadence of ocean waves, and imagine the phytoplankton hard at work just 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a dance, to spring.

CHRISTOPHER DOUBTS CHINA VETO ON N. KOREA SANCTIONS; DIPLOMACY: U.N. VOTE 
EXPECTED OVER NUCLEAR PLANT INSPECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher predicted Sunday that China will not 
veto a U.N. Security Council resolution imposing economic sanctions on North 
Korea if Kim Il Sung's hard-line regime refuses to permit inspections of its 
suspected nuclear weapons sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "China has a very strong interest -- the same one we have -- that North Korea 
not go nuclear," Christopher said. "I think they will support us on the Korean 
question because it is in their own self-interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on CBS' "Face the Nation," Christopher confirmed that the Clinton 
Administration will seek U.N. sanctions, reinstate suspended U.S.-South Korea 
military maneuvers and ship Patriot missile defense systems to South Korea 
unless North Korea reverses course and permits inspections by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said there is still "some hope" that North Korea will allow 
the inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "There appear to be people within North Korea that want to proceed to 
normalization of their country's relations with the international community, 
and people who don't," Clinton said upon arriving in Miami for a health care 
forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some extent, the ball is still clearly in their court. But we are 
proceeding to consider all our options," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAEA board of directors meets in Vienna today to consider North Korea's 
refusal to permit unfettered inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board determines that North Korea has violated non-proliferation 
guidelines -- as it almost certainly will -- the matter will be sent to the 
U.N. Security Council for action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be seeking a resolution," Christopher said. "I think we'll be preparing 
for trade sanctions, but exactly what happens in the U.N., we'll have to wait 
to see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Because China is one of North Korea's few remaining allies, there has been 
speculation that Beijing will use its Security Council veto to block action 
against Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fears are heightened by the friction in U.S.-China relations caused by 
U.S. criticism of China's human rights performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher, who returned last week from an acrimonious visit to Beijing, 
said he expects China to either abstain or vote for the resolution. Either 
action would virtually ensure its approval. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Christopher said the Administration will not back down from 
its threat to cancel China's favorable trade status unless Beijing makes 
substantial progress on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Many U.S. business leaders have suggested that U.S.-China trade relations are 
too valuable to be put at risk in a dispute over the way China treats its own 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 The China trade "is important to us, but it is even more important to them," 
Christopher said, noting that 40% of China's exports come to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's decision to punish North Korea for blocking nuclear 
inspections won bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on NBC's "Meet the Press," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) called for 
sanctions, military exercises and deployment of Patriot missile systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole went even further, suggesting that "we may want to beef up our own forces 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States maintains more than 36,000 troops in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said there are no plans now to increase U.S. troop strength in 
Korea, although he said, "We'll be looking at that situation day in and day 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. forces in Korea would probably come under fire in the opening minutes 
of any new North Korea-South Korea conflict.

BOSTON MOTORCADE, MINUS GAY GROUP, HONK FOR ST. PATRICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a St. Patrick's Day celebration Sunday in South Boston after all -- 
minus an Irish gay and lesbian group. 
</P>
<P>
 A hastily organized motorcade of more than 200 vehicles briefly cruised the 
traditional route of the St. Patrick's parade, which organizers canceled this 
year after a court ordered them to allow the gay group to march. 
</P>
<P>
 With headlights on, horns honking and passengers waving, the motorcade drove 
up and down East Broadway, the commercial heart of South Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The unofficial observance lasted less than an hour. There were no protests or 
confrontations, and drivers in the motorcade obeyed all traffic laws, police 
spokesman Jerry Vanderwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the motorcade was not illegal and did not require a parade permit 
because organizers did not request a police escort or the rerouting of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, known 
as GLIB, said the motorcade was an illegal attempt to evade the court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 GLIB, which marched under court order in the 1992 and 1993 parades, said it 
would not protest and planned a separate celebration at a 
Unitarian-Universalist church. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's motorcade was organized by several groups, including the South Boston 
Allied War Veterans Council, which runs the traditional parade. The groups used 
flyers, signs and word of mouth.

BEFORE HEALTH FORUM, CLINTONS SPEND DAY AT EXCLUSIVE RESORT

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton helicoptered Sunday to 
a pricey resort island that promises "a serene, pampered environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons arrived in Florida a day early for a health care forum and 
Democratic fund-raiser scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons took the day off on Fisher Island, a 216-acre exclusive resort 
south of Miami Beach and north of Key Biscayne. The island is accessible only 
by helicopter and ferry; a private security force keeps unwanted visitors away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons arrived in Miami late Sunday afternoon, then made the brief trip 
to the island aboard Marine One. The suite used by the Clintons cost the White 
House $500, spokesman Jeff Eller said.

MODERN ARTWORKS STOLEN IN ATHENS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Modern artworks by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall and others, estimated as worth 
more than $500,000, have been stolen from an Athens museum, police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38 lithographs and prints by some of the world's most distinguished 
painters and sculptors belonged to a private collection on display at the 
Goulandris-Horn Foundation since Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Prints by Spanish painter Joan Miro, French painter Fernand Leger and Swiss 
sculptor Alberto Giacometti were among works missing from the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the theft took place between Thursday night and Friday morning, 
when the foundation's neoclassical building in the Plaka area under the 
Acropolis was not guarded.

RIOTING KURDS CLASH WITH GERMAN POLICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurds demonstrating for an independent homeland clashed with police in Berlin 
and in the Bavarian city of Augsburg. More than 80 police and at least four 
Kurdish protesters were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police took 24 Kurds into custody to face riot charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berlin, 38 police were hurt in clashes Saturday with Kurds, who threw 
stones and firebombs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bavaria, trouble began Saturday after police stopped buses carrying about 
6,000 Kurds to a banned demonstration in Augsburg linked to today's annual 
Kurdish spring festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Kurds blocked the Munich-Stuttgart expressway, overturning several 
vehicles and setting fire to improvised barricades. Police used water cannons 
to clear the road after about nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were street battles in Augsburg, where courts had banned a Kurdish 
rally on grounds that it had been called by the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party, 
known as the PKK.

500-meter World Cup race of the season, clocking 36.25 seconds, and beating Dan 
Jansen, who had already won the overall gold medal.

 Jansen said he would not decide until the summer whether to continue skating 
another season, but Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair said she will skate for 
one more year so she can compete at the World Championships in Milwaukee next 
year.

 "Woman warrior." That's what Elizabeth Guerrera's last name means in Spanish, 
and from the moment she arrives in the Central American country of Bellavista 
to report for a New York newspaper, it's evident that she will have to do her 
share of fighting -- against her editors, U.S. diplomats and advisers; against 
the country's repressive military, and, most of all, against herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellavista has an earthquake-ravaged capital like Nicaragua's and a right-wing 
oligarchy like El Salvador's. It is full of dirty secrets, including the mass 
murder of civilians. Guerrera's job is to ferret out those secrets, but she has 
a secret of her own: a masochistic attraction to men such as Bellavista's 
defense minister, Gen. Victor Rivas Valdez. Serious as "A Year of Favor" is, 
one can't help thinking of the little devil and the little angel that buzz like 
flies around the head of a cartoon character faced with a moral choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The devil here is Rivas Valdez, touted as a centrist strongman by U.S. 
officials who seem to have learned nothing from the Vietnam War except how to 
manipulate the press. Under a veneer of civility, he is a sadist in private as 
well as a tyrant in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fierce and reckless wanting," Guerrera says of the affair that will 
ruin her career. "I'd wanted him to touch me -- as if, when he did so, he would 
give me some of his power." 
</P>
<P>
 The angel is Mary Healy, an East Coast socialite turned midwife and 
missionary, who says Bellavista's real problem is "sin . . . evil at work in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Healy argues: "The skirmishes all of you (journalists) write about, your 
tallies of victories and losses, don't matter. . . . The rise or fall of 
communism is irrelevant. Because a spiritual process has been set into motion. 
The poor have begun taking part in . . . their own liberation." 
</P>
<P>
 Subordinate angels are Sonia Alvinas, the street-tough Bellavistan 
photographer who sneeringly calls Guerrera "Miss America," and Alan Hartwell, 
her predecessor, who ruined his career by jettisoning objectivity in his search 
for the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you tell both sides when one side, the most powerful side, is lying 
-- and the other side is inaccessible?" Hartwell asks. "Besides, when you know 
they're lying, isn't it irresponsible, and immoral, to repeat their lies?" 
</P>
<P>
 Torn and wavering, Guerrera spends most of "A Year of Favor" -- the title 
refers to one of Healy's mystical concepts -- in such extremes of lust, fear, 
bewilderment, exhaustion and awe that the crisp little news stories at the end 
of each chapter seem to have been written by somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia MacDonnell, a former reporter, does several things well in her first 
novel. She writes vividly of the craft of journalism and her not-so-imaginary 
Central America. She has a powerful vision of women as a life-giving force that 
counteracts murderous machismo. Births figure prominently; the novel's best 
scene is of Healy performing a Caesarean section by candlelight on a 
15-year-old girl in a refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonnell takes a big risk, though, by giving Guerrera such a major weakness. 
Try as she does to explain it by references to Guerrera's absent father; her 
clinging mother; her gloomy Catholic upbringing; her sense of herself as a 
blond, green-eyed "fake ethnic"; her insecurity in a male-dominated profession; 
her inability to bear children, it still seems far-fetched that she would fall 
so abjectly for Rivas Valdez, who -- although tall, dark, handsome and magnetic 
-- is obviously a creep. 
</P>
<P>
 Their love scenes seem borrowed from another kind of novel, as if chapters 
from "The Story of O" were scattered through Joan Didion's "Book of Common 
Prayer." The political and social story -- even the feminist story of women's 
empowerment -- is obscured rather than heightened, because Guerrera is such a 
special case. 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonnell surely tells some of the truth about U.S. misdeeds in Central 
America in the 1980s. And since journalism didn't seem to blow the whistle loud 
enough -- it gave us plenty of facts but not enough context -- she recasts that 
truth in fiction, at the cost of inventing some facts and simplifying others, 
as fiction must do. At her best, it's a moving story that makes us wish we had 
read the newspaper more carefully.

 'Gun' Shoots a Bull's-Eye: "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult" shot to the 
top spot at the box office over the weekend. The comedy from Paramount starring 
Leslie Nielsen grossed $13.5 million in its opening weekend, according to early 
industry estimates. TriStar's "Guarding Tess" dropped to second with $5 
million. Another newcomer, the kid-pleaser "Monkey Trouble" from New Line, was 
third with $4.6 million. Universal's "Schindler's List" fared well during the 
pre-Oscar weekend with $4 million and fourth place. Savoy Pictures' "Lightning 
Jack" was in fifth place with $3.2 million. Universal's "The Paper" had an 
impressive opening in limited release. The movie grossed $165,000 on only five 
screens, including two in Los Angeles, for a respectable $33,000 per screen.

 Get Razzed: And the loser is . . . "Indecent Proposal." The movie starring 
Demi Moore and Robert Redford was dishonored as worst picture of 1993 at the 
14th annual Oscar-spoof, the Golden Raspberry Awards held at the Hollywood 
Roosevelt on Sunday. The film was also given the worst screenplay award by the 
Golden Raspberry Award Foundation. The worst actor "Razzie" went to Burt 
Reynolds for "Cop and a Half," and Madonna was razzed as worst actress for 
"Body of Evidence." Worst new star went to Janet Jackson for "Poetic Justice," 
and worst director went to Jennifer Chambers Lynch for "Boxing Helena."

 A Party for Regular Folk: With several charities competing for superstar 
attendees for their Oscar night benefits, one party is being held for those 
regular folk who just want a festive atmosphere from which to watch the 
trophies being handed out. Ed Debevic's, the '50s-themed Beverly Hills diner, 
is hosting its party tonight as a benefit for the Los Angeles Regional 
Foodbank. The all-you-can-eat buffet is open to all for $19.94.

 Food for Thought: Extra food from those glamorous Oscar night parties will not 
go to waste, thanks to the End Hunger Network. As part of a program sponsored 
by the group devoted to increasing awareness of hunger, along with the Los 
Angeles Regional Foodbank's Extra Helpings project, the unserved food will be 
donated to homeless shelters, soup kitchens and food pantries in Los Angeles, 
particularly in downtown's Skid Row. Actor Jeff Bridges, who will present an 
Oscar tonight, is a board member of the organization and was active in setting 
up the program.

 Eldin No More: Actor Robert Pastorelli has announced he will be leaving the 
CBS comedy "Murphy Brown," where he's played house painter-turned-nanny Eldin 
Bernecky since the show's 1988 premiere. Pastorelli will segue to a new CBS 
series, "Double Rush," produced by "Murphy Brown's" Diane English and Joel 
Shukovsky along with Stephen Nathan, who worked on the husband-and-wife team's 
"Love & War." The new series is about a New York City bicycle messenger 
delivery service owned by Pastorelli's character. David Arquette, Adam Goldberg

of the Detroit radio station where star Martin Lawrence is host. Filming is set 
for today on a scene in which Stan has reconstructive facial surgery to hide 
from the Internal Revenue Service. The episode will air in May. The actor is 
still recovering from being shot in the chest and arm in an attempted robbery 
in South-Central Los Angeles. QUICK TAKES

 Lena Olin has a new leading man: film director Lasse Hallstrom ("What's Eating 
Gilbert Grape?"). The two were married at a secret ceremony Friday in a 
Stockholm church. . . . High school students in Vienna are able to see 
"Schindler's List" free as part of a project announced by the city's mayor, 
Helmut Zilk. After the screenings, students question Holocaust survivors and 
other witnesses of the Nazi years. The first such participant was Nazi hunter 
Simon Wiesenthal. . . . The false eyelashes Glenn Close wore in her 100th 
performance as Norma Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard," signed by Close and framed, 
will be on the auction block tonight to raise money for the AIDS Hospice 
Foundation at an Oscar party at the Directors Guild of America. . . . The new 
CBS series "704 Hauser" premieres April 11 at 8:30 p.m., not 8 p.m. as was 
previously reported. Moving into the 8 p.m. slot that night is "Dave's World."

HUMOROUS 'FLOOR' PROBES THE MOTHER-DAUGHTER WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle between mothers and daughters approaches bedlam in Cheryl L. West's 
"Jar the Floor," at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 West throws four generations of resentful daughters together -- and these 
women not only jar the floor, they raise the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a familiar theme. For one of many examples, think of the Witch in "Into 
the Woods" (which happens to have been born at the Old Globe) lamenting about 
how children transform from someone you love into someone you lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiply that feeling by four and you glimpse the rage and the irony within 
"Jar the Floor." West handles the irony even better than the rage; it's "Jar 
the Floor," not "Gnash the Teeth." This show is desperately funny. 
</P>
<P>
 West also varies the nuances of her skirmishes so as to avoid monotony. How do 
these women love/hate their mothers, and vice versa? Let us count the ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest is Vennie (Susan Payne), 27, a struggling pop singer whose mother 
gave her every advantage. She feels smothered -- and determined to throw these 
advantages back in her mother's face. Her latest best friend (Jurian Hughes) 
is, significantly, of the same sex and of a different race. Eyebrows rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Vennie's uptight mother is MayDee (Brenda Pressley), 47, a college professor 
who awaits news of whether she got her tenure. MayDee felt neglected by her own 
mother -- which is why she tries too hard to compensate with her daughter. 
MayDee is even more disdainful of men than her daughter; we soon learn that she 
was molested by one of her mother's many boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 Lola (Crystal Laws Green), 65, is MayDee's mom. OK, she may not have been 
there when MayDee needed her. But she provided piano lessons -- money that was 
wasted, as MayDee now refuses to touch the keyboard. Besides, look at Lola's 
own history. If her father played with her, her mother got jealous -- and made 
it clear that she preferred Lola's brother. As a result, Lola has always sought 
comfort in the arms of men. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's MaDear (Irma P. Hall), 90, Lola's mother and the matriarch 
whose birthday party is the occasion for this particular reunion. MaDear's wits 
are slipping away. But, near play's end, we get a glimpse of her problem as 
well. Her own mother impressed on her a sense of her "nappy-headed" ugliness. 
No wonder she felt insecure. 
</P>
<P>
 MaDear's mother isn't around to defend herself, so we don't get to hear what 
her own mother did to her . But we get the point. 
</P>
<P>
 West traces a few moments in which racism affected this endless cycle of 
recriminations and regrets, but she also makes it clear that these patterns 
transcend race. Raisa, Vennie's white friend, testifies that her own family is 
a lot like this one. That's hardly Raisa's only role in the play, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Raisa also is a cancer patient who visibly has only one breast left. West 
treads on the edge of sentimentality here and risks diffusing her own focus. 
However, Raisa is hardly there to jerk tears; if anything, her condition 
provokes healthy laughter when we see the older women react to it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of this family's problems is that they all disapprove of each other's 
looks, in one way or another. Raisa's matter-of-fact attitude toward her 
appearance challenges them on this score. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, West knows how to write her way through potentially treacherous 
territory. Her dialogue is wonderfully flavorful and moves the play along 
quickly. Indeed, the Lola-MaDear relationship could use a bit of embellishment; 
its details remain a bit sketchy. But, by then, the play is on its way to a 
semi-ritualistic conclusion that momentarily lifts the women out of their 
endless cycle for a brief moment of mutual support. It's an affecting ending, 
although its warmth probably won't last. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this production is the prolific West's introduction to the Southland, 
her cast has played these roles in other productions, and this is the fifth 
"Jar the Floor" that Tazewell Thompson has staged. All that earlier work pays 
off in the vigor and seamlessness of this ensemble. As usual, sight lines in 
the arena-style Cassius Carter arena are occasionally obscured, but, here, the 
intimacy is well worth these minor sacrifices. 
</P>

CHAN COMBINES SLAPSTICK, MARTIAL ARTS IN 'PROJECT A' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Project A," a frequently funny 1984 martial arts comedy in which Jackie Chan 
directs and co-writes as well as stars, takes us back somewhere around the turn 
of the century when, according to Chan, Hong Kong's coast guard was engaged in 
a fierce rivalry with its cops. 
</P>
<P>
 As a stalwart of the guard, Chan leads a barroom brawl against a haughty young 
police officer (Yuen Biao), only to wind up under his command when the guard is 
abruptly disbanded, having been undermined by a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan knows, however, that pirates will have to be dealt with sooner or later 
-- and that he of course will be in the midst of the fray. In this instance 
he's aided by his shady but helpful pal (comedian Samo Hung). 
</P>
<P>
 There's lots of wonderfully silly slapstick sequences, and there's an 
especially inspired sequence when Chan and a bad guy battle it out while 
enmeshed in the huge gears of a building clock -- Chan even dangles from its 
hands, a la Harold Lloyd in "Safety Last." 
</P>
<P>
 "Project A" is good-natured fun, but it could have been much better. 
</P>
<P>
 The production design is tacky and cheap, always a drawback in a period piece, 
with one garish European-style interior so rickety that it wobbles even before 
it breaks away during combat. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the film's whole sense of period is wobbly and vague. 
</P>
<P>
 "Project A," which has a running time of 1 hour, 46 minutes, would surely play 
better were it 15 minutes shorter.

MOVIE REVIEWS; SAVAGE, UNSTABLE MOM AT HEART OF ELEGANT, SCARY 'BOYS'

<P>
 "Mother's Boys," a scary and unsettling drama of psychological suspense, is as 
elegant as it is risk-taking. No wonder Jamie Lee Curtis was lured into 
returning to the kind of genre film with which she launched her career, for 
this handsome picture affords her the most bravura role of her big-screen 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 She is Jude Madigan, a beautiful, sexy wife and mother of three sons who in 
the throes of postpartum depression, abandons her rich Los Angeles family to 
wander about Europe. When her husband, Robert (Peter Gallagher), at last files 
for divorce, having fallen in love with a demure but resilient assistant 
principal (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) at his 12-year-old son's school, Jude 
abruptly terminates her three-year absence and returns home. No one, even her 
mother (Vanessa Redgrave), is remotely glad to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 Our initial tentative sympathy for Jude gradually evaporates when we realize 
that she's not interested in merely winning visiting rights or even partial 
custody of her three children. She is absolutely and utterly determined to get 
back her entire family, including her husband. In time we realize we're in the 
presence of a dangerously unstable but utterly ruthless and resourceful woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Barry Schneider and Richard Hawley's adroit adaptation of Bernard 
Taylor's novel, director Yves Simoneau dares to proceed at a languorous pace, 
which soon provides a fine contrast to Curtis' nervy, multifaceted portrayal of 
the savage -- and sometimes savagely funny -- Jude and ultimately sets up a 
jolting, literally cliff-hanging finish. The script is anchored in two sad 
truths about human nature: that the demons of one generation can so easily 
infect the next, and that nice, decent people can be exceedingly vulnerable to 
the clever sociopath. 
</P>
<P>
 Simoneau is wonderful with his actors, especially with young Luke Edwards in 
the pivotal role of Kes, the eldest son, the only one old enough to remember 
and feel abandoned by his mother, who proceeds to manipulate him for her own 
ends. "Mother's Boys" climaxes in an edge-of-your-seat action-filled finish, 
but it's actually at its scariest in its convincing depiction of the horrendous 
things people do to one another in the name of love.

JAZZ REVIEW; MULLIGAN QUARTET RETAINS REPUTATION FOR CREATIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than 40 years Gerry Mulligan has been one of the most versatile 
musicians in jazz. Saturday at the Ambassador Auditorium, he displayed his two 
principal gifts, as baritone saxophonist and composer, while offering evidence 
of his ability as a talent scout. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan led his first famous quartet in 1952; since then his quartets, 
quintets and numerous othertets have maintained a consistently creative level; 
among them his present group ranks exceptionally high. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Rosenthal is a pianist of rarest skill, weaving rapid single-note lines 
that span out into rich chordal patterns, parallel octaves and hints of the 
blues. He works in complete empathy with Mulligan, occasionally doubling the 
melody but generally playing a subtly supportive role. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Johnson joined the rapidly swelling ranks of brilliant bass players, both 
in sectional and solo contributions. Ron Vincent on drums completes a spirited 
group that gives Mulligan the impetus he needs. 
</P>
<P>
 If any complaint could be lodged against this admirable program, it would be 
his near-total failure to announce the tunes. Most were attractive originals; a 
couple were standards ("Georgia on My Mind," "My Funny Valentine") and "When I 
Was a Young Man" reminded us that Mulligan has a charming way with words. He 
should sing more often. LEONARD FEATHER

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; TEXAN SHAVER IN DOWN-TO-EARTH SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So much has been written in praise of Jimmie Dale Gilmore in the '90s that 
it's easy to assume he's the only overlooked Texas veteran of worth in country 
music. Before you buy that, check out Billy Joe Shaver, who made a rare West 
Coast appearance on Friday at Jacks Sugar Shack. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-year-old singer-songwriter has been recording since the early '70s 
without ever having a country hit to call his own, though his songs have been 
hits for everyone from Waylon Jennings to John Anderson. His music contributed 
greatly to country's classic outlaw movement, helping define the romantic, 
wanderlust notion of someone who doesn't have to answer to anything but his 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 After a low profile for years, Shaver bounced back last year with "Tramp on 
the Street," an album whose spiritually tinged highlights showcased an 
endearing, optimistic spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a hard-biting, three-piece band that included his son Eddy on 
guitar, Shaver was as down-to-earth as his songs in the opening set Friday. 
Though his voice was frequently buried in the sound mix, he found enough 
breathing room on the acoustic numbers to demonstrate the richness and warmth 
of his music.  
</P>
<P>
 In a time when country music is selling more than ever but finding it 
increasingly difficult to reflect the simple human traits of its tradition, 
artists like Shaver are too valuable for the country world to ignore. ROBERT 
HILBURN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; DAVIS CONDUCTS MANNHEIM STEAMROLLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chip Davis, the Nebraska-based composer who appeared at the Universal 
Amphitheatre on Saturday with his Mannheim Steamroller, has been one of the 
remarkable success stories of the music business for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 His loosely-defined ensemble is actually a range of different sized groups 
that have sold almost 10 million albums of original compositions Davis likes to 
describe as "18th-Century rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 What he conducted with his full orchestra on Saturday, however, had very 
little rock or roll, and a great deal of atmospheric, film music-like themes 
bearing titles such as "Sunrise at Rhodes," "Earthrise" and "Dancing Flames."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Davis was also the composer of C. W. McCall's 1976 novelty hit 
"Convoy," his preferences clearly lean toward combining easy-listening melodies 
with classical forms and orchestrations. But many of his pieces Saturday were 
so short, and so epigrammatic, that they functioned primarily as accompaniment 
for a series of big-screen projections of nature scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' conducting -- workmanlike and efficient with his own music -- produced 
a concert-opening reading of segments of the "Spring" Concerto from Vivaldi's 
"Four Seasons" that can most charitably be described as lugubrious. Mannheim 
Steamroller seems a more appropriate medium for his skills. DON HECKMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MCGOVERN GIVES MUSICALLY SUPERB SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maureen McGovern's performance at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts 
on Friday (where she appeared with the recently reviewed Joel Grey) may not 
have had Whitney Houston's contemporary stylishness or Barbra Streisand's 
legendary framing, but in terms of pure, gorgeously articulated, musically 
superb singing, it was as good as mainstream pop gets. 
</P>
<P>
 What raises McGovern above most other artists in her stylistic arena is her 
unique combination of a natural vocal ability, knowledgeable musicality and an 
amiable manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Her readings of "What Is This Thing Called Love" and "Every Time We Say 
Goodbye," for example, were equivalent to the cleaning away of accumulated dust 
and grime from medieval paintings -- brilliant re-establishments of the bright 
colors of the original works. 
</P>
<P>
 On "A Little Jazz Bird" and "Mr. Paganini," she displayed her astounding 
four-octave range but never as a show-off device and always with precise 
musical accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Further expanding her stylistic presentation, she created a fanciful parody of 
Deanna Durbin singing "Tales From the Vienna Woods" and countered with a 
theatrical rendering of Comden, Green and Styne's "If" (from "Two on the 
Aisle"). It was a splendid demonstration of a world-class artist at the peak of 
her powers. DON HECKMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; BLUES BLOWDOWN AT STRAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the event's name, you'd suppose that the eighth annual Blues Harmonica 
Blowdown would be a lung-powered cutting contest, with laurels going to whoever 
was left standing after all the gusts had died down. 
</P>
<P>
 But far from presenting the blues as a zero-sum game that tries to winnow the 
losers from the winners, the show on Saturday at the sold-out Strand suggested 
that blues music is an open door through which musicians of varying 
temperaments and styles are welcome to enter.For this evening, at least, player 
after player and band after band went through that door and found something on 
the other side that brought out the vitality in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The satisfying if overlong program (seven acts playing for more than six 
hours) featured the loving but playfully rendered traditionalism of the 
Hollywood Fats Band, reunited after 15 years -- sans the late Fats, but with 
his guitar protege David (Kid) Ramos ably complementing Al Blake's astute 
vocals and harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently revamped James Harman Band played with reinvigorated sizzle, and 
the night ended with the virtuosic, highly idiosyncratic jamming of Carey Bell 
Harrington, who got his schooling in the harmonica on the 1950s Chicago blues 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A solid under card of Southern California blues talent included young veteran 
Robert Lucas, and elderly veteran Blind Joe Hill. Harmonica Fats, another 
longtime presence on the Los Angeles blues scene, was casual about playing his 
namesake, but made a strong impression with gritty, biting vocals and his 
trademark stage antics. MIKE BOEHM

DANCE REVIEWS; CONTRASTING IMPRESSIONS FROM LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Asked to describe what his ballets looked like, choreographer Alonzo King 
declined. "For me, that's appearance stuff," he told a Times writer recently. 
"My obsession is getting behind appearances to the essence of something." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, appearances are what are first encountered in dance, and first 
encounters of two works danced by King's San Francisco-based LINES Contemporary 
Ballet troupe Saturday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre gave widely contrasting 
impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bach Cello Suite" showed the choreographer's sensitive musicality and his 
company to be warm, gracious communicators as well as strong technicians. 
"Compelling Geological Evidence," reviewed in these pages after it was 
performed in San Diego in 1992, however, seemed diffuse and over-freighted with 
intellectual pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Balanchine said that mothers-in-law can't be shown in ballet because that kind 
of relationship cannot be demonstrated strictly through movement. How much more 
difficult it is to show in movement "the boundary lines vanishing . . . between 
the realms of the living and the non-living," which is a quote by scientist 
Jagadis Chandra Bose that King appended to the program note for "Geological 
Evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What we saw in the hourlong work was a gradual transition from simpler to 
complex structures, from few dancers to many, and the eventual appearance of 
Katherine Warner, presumably as Bose, equipped with spelunker gear, measuring a 
few dancers, capturing one of them, crawling on all fours, seeming to descend 
in space. 
</P>
<P>
 In some striking images, she also tried to climb a ladder only to be pushed 
back again and again, whereas another dancer reached the top and still another 
struggled through the rungs. 
</P>
<P>
 But meanings were often far from clear. Without Bose's quote as guidance, who 
would have guessed that "points of contact" were emerging between "the living 
and the non-living"? 
</P>
<P>
 No such intellectual weight burdened the Bach Suite, set to seven movements 
drawn from three of Bach's Suites for Solo Cello. 
</P>
<P>
 King responded to the phrasing and accent of the music and even to the texture 
of the bowing by the unidentified cellist (on recording), extending ballet 
technique with infusions of modern dance and gymnastics, sometimes extraneously 
so but mostly with impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The company in general looked terrific here, with especially notable 
contributions by a heroic Christopher Boatwright, an intense Yannis Adoniou, a 
poised Valerie Madonia and Carmen Rozestraten and Gregory Dawson in fluidly 
executing a duet of tensile strength and sinuous line. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was part of the Feet First Contemporary Dance Series sponsored by 
the Irvine theater and UCI Cultural Events.

TV REVIEW; 'HECK WITH HOLLYWOOD!': INDIE LOOK AT INDIE FILM BIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seldom has a filmmaker shared more in common with his subject than Doug Block 
with the fellow struggling American independent movie makers in his acerbic yet 
cheery "The Heck With Hollywood!" It's strategically airing on KCET-TV Channel 
28 as soon as the Hollywood Establishment has had its self-celebratory orgy 
with the Academy Awards tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the Bravo Channel is promoting its airing of the Independent Spirit 
Awards during breaks in Oscarcast, the real, hard-bitten, rock-hard indies are 
in Block's film. He's collected a good range of types. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Artist is documentarian Jennifer Fox, whose "Beirut: The Last Home Movie" 
is her personal account of a visit to Beirut to inquire why people are drawn to 
war -- and why she is as well. The Good Guy is Ted Lichtenheld, and with his 
violence- and sex-free movie starring David Morse, "Personal Foul," he presents 
an ideal of Middle American cinema. The Huckster Clowns are director Gerry Cook 
and co-producers Charlie Schmidt and Peter Hundrichs as they hustle to sell 
their made-in-Spokane comedy, "Only a Buck," about -- of all things -- a guy 
trying to make his own movie. 
</P>
<P>
 They reflect the shades of value in the movie business, independent or not, 
and they surely reflect Block's own personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is a serious go-getter, with a clear sense of her role as an artist and 
businesswoman, both reflective about her work and willing to run around New 
York streets to put up posters. She doesn't hedge ("I'm not a Hollywood 
filmmaker"), she knows how to operate at the annual Independent Film Project 
market, and she openly criticizes her distributor, Circle Releasing, when she 
thinks it's not working as hard as she is. Even better, "Beirut" wins awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Lichtenheld's film doesn't wow folks at the IFP screening for "Personal Foul," 
and, judging by the clips here, that's not surprising: It looks like a lame TV 
movie-of-the-week. But Lichtenheld filmed it in his hometown of Rockford, Ill., 
risked his marriage and credit rating, seduced investors and secured a 
distributor.  
</P>
<P>
 Block probably has the most fun with Cook and his buddies, who work up all 
sorts of gimmicks to sell their comedy, from a portable video monitor showing 
clips from "Only a Buck" to a traveling van from which they actually sell video 
copies.  
</P>
<P>
 Fox, Lichtenheld, Cook, Block -- they're all seemingly hooked on a crazy 
dream, since even the movie we're watching was a struggle to get made and sold. 
</P>
<P>
 But we're seeing it, aren't we?

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: THE OSCARS

<P>
 PARTY TIME: Tonight is Oscar night, and Orange County is celebrating with 
parties at places like Planet Hollywood, Roxbury and the Sports Club Irvine. . 
. . Playwrights and thespians will watch the telecast at the Laguna Playhouse 
and bestow some awards of their own. Last year, for example, they declared 
"Vidal Sasoon Bad-Hair Day" and "Edith Head Worst-Dressed" winners. . . . The 
$15-per-head event is "more of a friend-raiser for us than a fund-raiser," says 
spokesman Richard Stein. 
</P>
<P>
 WEST COAST FRONT: Many motion pictures have been filmed in Orange County, but 
the most-awarded was "All Quiet on the Western Front," an anti-war, World War I 
epic. . . . The 1930 film, shot in the then-barren hills above Corona del Mar 
where Harbor View Homes now stand, won Academy Awards for best picture and for 
best director, Lewis Milestone. . . . For trivia buffs: It was Milestone's 
second milestone. He won best comedy director for "Two Arabian Knights" in 
1928, the first-ever Oscar ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSIE RUBBLE: Actor-comedienne Rosie O'Donnell, one of the Oscar presenters 
tonight (her 32nd birthday), will star as Rizzo in the pre-Broadway tour of a 
revival of "Grease" at the Orange County Performing Arts Center beginning next 
week. . . . A resident of the San Fernando Valley who will stay locally during 
the run, O'Donnell has appeared in films like "A League of Their Own" and 
"Sleepless in Seattle." Come May she'll be Betty Rubble in the movie version of 
the cartoon classic "The Flintstones." 
</P>
<P>
 CLASS PROJECT: A group of USC cinema professors, addressing the Orange County 
alumni chapter in Santa Ana last week, told how difficult it will be for their 
kids to get into the film school. . . . Two films nominated for the 
best-documentary Oscar tonight were made by current USC students, and one made 
an Oscar-nominated film even before applying to USC. . . . It appears, joked 
USC administrator Mark Harris, that "you have to make an Academy 
Award-nominated film just to get into our school. This sets a new standard."

5.3 AFTERSHOCK RATTLES SOUTHLAND; TEMBLOR: FRIGHTENED PEOPLE FLEE STORES AND 
MOVIE THEATERS AND TWO FIRES ARE STARTED. BUT THERE IS LITTLE OTHER DAMAGE FROM 
THIRD-LARGEST JOLT SINCE THE JAN. 17 NORTHRIDGE QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A powerful aftershock to the Northridge earthquake rolled across Southern 
California on Sunday, igniting two fires, disrupting power to thousands of San 
Fernando Valley residents and sending people fleeing from malls and movie 
theaters, but inflicting little physical damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5.3-magnitude quake, centered near Panorama City, was felt over a wide 
area of Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties when it hit at 1:20 p.m. It 
was the third strongest of more than 6,000 aftershocks that have struck the 
region since the Jan. 17 quake that killed at least 61 people and caused at 
least $13 billion in structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh aftershock greater than magnitude 5.0, and it served to 
keep quake-jittery Angelenos on edge for yet another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeways sustained some "cosmetic cracking," but no major damage, a state 
transit official said. 
</P>
<P>
 For fans camped outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for tonight's Oscar 
ceremonies, the shaker gave them a second authentic L. A. experience -- but did 
not move them from their cherished places. Rhea Sprecher, an art teacher from 
Wisconsin, still managed to spot Debbie Allen, Goldie Hawn and others. "I felt 
some rumbling under my feet and I said: 'Would that be an earthquake?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, chandeliers swayed, seats rocked and huge pieces of scenery rattled. 
"Everybody, stay in your seats!" Oscar director Jeff Margolis ordered over the 
public address system. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city Fire Department officials said two fires were started by the 
earthquake. A mini-mall blaze in Van Nuys began because of electrical damage 
caused by the quake, and a transformer at a Department of Water and Power plant 
near Burbank Airport caught fire after earthquake damage caused oil in the unit 
to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire destroyed the Woodley Plaza shopping center in Van Nuys, burning a 
mini-market, video store and a restaurant, said Fire Department spokesman Jim 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 But elsewhere, there was little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, a minor rockslide failed to disrupt traffic. And in Santa Monica, 
life in the bustling Third Street Promenade shopping and dining area was back 
to normal shortly after the temblor stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seismically, this is a very expected behavior. Probably the big news story in 
this earthquake is people's nerves," said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere, hundreds of people were evacuated 
from malls and theaters as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people were removed from IKEA, a home furnishings store in 
Burbank. Despite shoppers' anxiety, the evacuation was quick and orderly, said 
Dennis Rodriguez, the store's operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were a little frightened. We got workers together with customers and 
guided them downstairs," Rodriguez said. Some children were separated from 
parents but were reunited outside the building, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 500 shoppers were evacuated from the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall, 
where the aftershock shattered plate glass alongside an escalator and sent some 
overhead spotlights crashing to the floor. No one was injured at the mall, 
where the first 34 of the complex's 140 stores closed since the Jan. 17 quake 
reopened only Saturday, employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the rain yesterday, and another aftershock today," said Bob Smith, a 
mall employee. "It's been a tough weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also rocked the Glendale Galleria shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shook us pretty hard," said Drew Boghorsyan of the mall's customer 
services department. "We heard the building just rumble. It was really scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Boghorsyan said 26 of the 248 stores in the mall closed after the quake 
because merchants wanted to go home. He said he knew of no damage to the stores 
that closed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sherman Oaks house, moved off its foundation by the Jan. 17 quake and 
scheduled for demolition today, was sent sliding another 20 feet down the 
hillside, imperiling other houses below. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley movie theaters, moviegoers fled their seats as they were showered 
with broken plaster and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some big tiles that fell down," said John Corcoran, who was at the 
Fallbrook Mall theater in Canoga Park. The jolt also shook up construction 
workers still repairing damage from the January temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 James Booth of Burbank was on a bucket lift filling cracks on the second floor 
of the Cal State Northridge science building when the shaking hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was this jackass shaking the bottom of the lift," Booth said, 
pointing to a co-worker. Then, he added, "I thought the entire building was 
going to come down." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge Fashion Center, badly damaged in the January quake, 23 
employees from a wrecking firm also were startled by the aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the center of the mall when it hit," said Al Flores, a supervisor 
for Cleveland Wrecking Co. "It was a lot of bumping up and down. We just got 
all our people together, made sure everyone was all right, and got out of 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer Chris Brock, of Law/Crandall Inc., a firm hired to evaluate the 
damage caused at CSUN by the Northridge quake, said inspectors have found "many 
new cracks, but nothing major yet." 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Monica conference of the Anxiety Disorders Assn. of America ended with 
a bang as the quake struck. "I tell you, the timing couldn't have been better. 
It was the last day, the last minute, the last second and it hit. It was pretty 
ironic," said association President Jerilyn Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 At Disneyland in Anaheim, some of the more elaborate attractions were 
temporarily closed down. At Universal Studios in Universal City, all 
attractions closed immediately after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cangco of Glendale was on a tram going over a bridge that falls apart as 
part of the special effects tour at Universal when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize it was an earthquake at the time. I thought it was an effect 
of the . . . tram." 
</P>
<P>
 But the shocks seemed too intense to be part of the attraction, he said, and 
the driver didn't say anything. The ride continued, but the King Kong and 
earthquake attractions, scheduled to be included in the tour, were closed. Only 
when the 45-minute ride ended did someone inform the riders that a real 
earthquake had hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock also knocked out power to about 77,000 San Fernando Valley 
residents, most for five minutes or less, Department of Water and Power 
spokeswoman Mindy Berman said. However, about 7,000 customers in Van Nuys were 
without electricity for half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, phone service in the western portion of the city was off for 
about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans reported minor damage to freeways near the epicenter of the 
aftershock, but none serious enough to close any roads. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Golden State Freeway north of Granada Hills, the aftershock dislodged 
temporary asphalt filler that had been used to close a 6-to-8-inch gap caused 
by the Northridge quake. Temporary asphalt fixes also came loose in a concrete 
overpass at the interchange of the Simi Valley and San Diego freeways. Caltrans 
crews quickly refilled the gaps without shutting down any of the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that would alarm anyone," said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie 
Tiritilli. "It's super-minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech seismologists said the aftershock was expected and fell within the 
normal range. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is perfectly normal. This is what we expect," said Egill Hauksson, a 
seismologist at Caltech. He said Sunday's shaking occurred on the east side of 
the fault plane where the main shock occurred on Jan. 17, but was not on the 
same fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismic authorities said the aftershock was centered about two miles 
west-northwest of Panorama City, and about three miles northeast of the 
epicenter of the Northridge quake. It fell within a "pie-shaped aftershock 
zone" where shocks have been clustered, Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock was closer to the surface than the Northridge quake, with 
preliminary estimates putting it about nine miles underground, compared to 12 
miles for the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 With a preliminary magnitude of 5.3, the quake is 1/20 the magnitude of the 
Jan. 17 quake. Hutton said the average number of aftershocks continues to 
decline each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's temblor "is an aftershock, but it is also an earthquake on its own" 
and will produce its own aftershocks, she said. However, there is only a 1 in 
20 chance that it was a precursor of a larger quake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two other aftershocks, at magnitudes 5.6 and 5.9, have been stronger than 
Sunday's, and both occurred the day of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's aftershock was followed by two lesser ones, a 3.4-magnitude 
aftershock recorded at 3:34 p.m., and another reading 2.7 at 8:05 p.m., 
seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a spokesman for Farmers Insurance Co. said Sunday's aftershock 
could trigger a temporary suspension of underwriting earthquake insurance in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geologists may call this an aftershock, but this is a separate quake for 
insurance purposes," said Jeffrey Beyer, spokesman for Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows insurers to impose a moratorium of up to 60 days on sales of 
earthquake insurance when an quake occurs. A moratorium imposed after the Jan. 
17 Northridge quake covered about 100 square miles and lasted no more than 30 
days at many companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any moratoriums still in effect," Bill Schulz, spokesman for 
the California Department of Insurance, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock prompted Valley business owners and authorities to close some 
public structures so they could check for structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, owners shut down the 75-store Media City Center mall for the day 
after sprinklers jolted by the aftershock drenched some shoppers. City building 
inspectors also ordered the mall parking structure closed until it could be 
inspected, said Lt. Don Brown, of the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said schools will be 
open "as usual" today, although workers will inspect repairs from the January 
quake to make sure they held. In all, 76 public schools were damaged in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, the district's facilities director, said, "We will be out at the 
schools where there was previous damage to make sure the repairs are still 
holding." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to hit the ones that had the most damage and the least permanent 
repair work done and work our way back from there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington, D.C.-based Anxiety Disorders Assn. had been discussing such 
problems as traumatic stress disorders, like those brought on by the Jan. 17 
quake, in its four-day conference at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final seminar drew to a close, the fifth-floor banquet room began to 
shake and the chandeliers rattled noisily. The seminar ended with applause and 
laughter -- for the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the 550-person conference had featured a seminar called "The Los 
Angeles Earthquake and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder." And as their time in 
the city came to a close, some of the psychiatrists and social workers joked 
about earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jokingly, we who'd never experienced an earthquake said, 'Gee, I wish I could 
feel just a little one so I could know what it feels like,' " Ross said. 
</P>

 SHIFTING GEARS: Peace is pushing a growing number of defense and aerospace 
firms to look for profit in building electric cars or other clean-burning 
vehicles (D1). . . . As is the case with APS Systems in Oxnard, some firms can 
minimize the employment casualties of the Cold War's end. "Despite the downturn 
in military-related business, we have been able to maintain our entire staff," 
said Steve Melkonian of APS. The 30-person firm still makes aircraft equipment, 
but is also busy building prototypes of an electric bus.

 SOUR NOTE: Eight months before the Civic Arts Plaza auditorium opens, the 
1,800-seat theater has spawned complaints of snubbing one of Ventura County's 
two symphonies and giving an unfair boost to the other (B4). . . . The director 
of Thousand Oaks' Conejo Symphony objects to the Oxnard-based Ventura County 
Symphony playing Wednesday night during the auditorium's first full week of 
operation. Everett Ascher persists in his complaints, even though the Conejo 
Symphony snagged the better weekend dates.

 HALL OF FAME: One is the winningest football coach in Ventura County history. 
Another is a five-sport letterman from Oxnard High School in 1937. A third is 
described as a legend among community softball leagues. . . . All of them, on 
June 18, will be inducted into the Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame. "It's a 
great honor," said John Reardon, head football coach of Rio Mesa High since 
1968. As for his title of winningest coach? "That's probably true because I've 
been around for so long."

 CATCH THE BULLET: Ventura County supervisors get a chance this week to be 
bullish on the bullet train. They will consider endorsing high-speed rail 
service that could whisk passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 5 1/2 
hours. The 125-m.p.h. train would stop in Ventura County along the way. It 
would also help restrain the 33% surge of traffic projected for the Ventura 
Freeway within 15 years.

 SPY FALLOUT: Although CIA Director R. James Woolsey has promised reforms, the 
Aldrich H. Ames spy case is costing the agency severely on Capitol Hill. Start 
with the CIA's secret budget, estimated at $30 billion a year. Many in the 
intelligence community argue that the Ames affair -- in which the Russians are 
said to have paid an accused "mole" more than $2 million for national security 
secrets -- proves the need for continued high-budget spying and counter-spying. 
But key lawmakers say they believe that the case demonstrates the need to slash 
CIA waste and inefficiency. "We're pounding money down a mole hole," one aide 
grumped. . . . Also in trouble is CIA-backed legislation to give the FBI access 
to bank records of CIA employees without notifying them. An aide said lawmakers 
"feel you can't legislate these problems away; they are part of the culture of 
secrecy that must be fixed with new leadership." . . . Congressional discontent 
with Woolsey is strong. In a closed session with the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, he was blistered for failing to bring in new management blood the 
way Louis J. Freeh did when he became FBI director last year.

 WINDY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN? Daring to return to the scene of one of the party's 
historic disasters, Democrats appear certain to hold their 1996 national 
convention in Chicago. Although four other cities are in the running, sources 
indicate that the Windy City clinched the deal with a monster reception thrown 
by Mayor Richard M. Daley for top Democratic officials, including Chicagoan 
David Wilhelm, the party's national chairman. The mayor served up mountains of 
Chicago-style hot dogs, deep-dish pizza, chocolate cheesecake -- and a 16-piece 
jazz ensemble. . . . Daley is untroubled at the prospect of reviving unpleasant 
memories of the politically ruinous convention of 1968, when his late father, 
the former mayor, was the focus of outrage as Vietnam War protesters clashed 
with police in the streets. "Vietnam is over," the younger Daley told a 
reporter. "They lifted the embargo."

 NO SALE: The Clinton White House has taken a brisk broom to more than just the 
chefs, ushers and travel agents there. Now it has swept away a small business 
that sells, to the White House staff and press corps, a wide range of items 
bearing an official-looking White House crest. . . . All through the Ronald 
Reagan and George Bush presidencies, no one complained about the sale of these 
curios, ranging from crystal glasses to golf club covers. In fact, Bush and his 
wife sent many handwritten notes to Taddese Ghebremeschel, owner of G.M.L. 
Design Inc. of Arlington, Va., thanking him for shirts and jackets carrying the 
words "White House" above an eagle similar to the one on the presidential seal. 
Ghebremeschel says he also had "verbal permission" from Reagan and Bush lawyers 
to operate. . . . But Clinton counsel Marvin Krislov has demanded in a letter 
to G.M.L. that it cease sales because they violate "longstanding White House 
policy" regarding use of the White House logo. Ghebremeschel is going out of 
business with bitter words: "I thought President Clinton was supposed to be for 
the little guy." . . . Commented presidential spokesman Arthur Jones: "We do 
everything we can to avoid commercialization of White House property."

KENNETH MACKEY, 76; THIRD EARL OF INCHCAPE, EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenneth James William Mackey, the third Earl of Inchcape, who molded his 
family's global trading empire into Inchcape & Co. with shipping giant P & O 
Steam Navigation Co. at its head, has died at age 76, the British media 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 No time or cause of death was given. 
</P>
<P>
 Descended from a lengthy line of wealthy merchants and traders, the earl by 
age 31 was a director of 18 companies and a partner in nine others. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw P & O through difficult times as chairman in the 1970s and multiplied 
the family's wealth many times over during his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Inchcape was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge University. He 
became the third Earl of Inchcape when his father died in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II he commanded an armored car unit in Italy and France. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1946, he went to work in the Calcutta offices of the British India Line, 
where James Mackey, the first earl, had begun his rise to fortune in 1874. The 
company merged with P & O in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 Inchcape returned to Britain in 1948 to manage family interests in tea, 
cotton, engineering, shipping and insurance, chiefly in India but also in East 
Africa, the Persian Gulf and Australia.

LEWIS GRIZZARD; SOUTHERN HUMORIST AND COLUMNIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lewis Grizzard, whose down-home humor in columns and books such as "My Daddy 
Was a Pistol and I'm a Son of a Gun" delighted and sometimes enraged readers, 
died Sunday. He was 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Grizzard had a history of heart trouble, including four operations, the most 
recent one Friday at Emory University Hospital. He never regained consciousness 
before he died in the intensive care unit, a hospital statement said. The 
surgery led to extensive brain damage, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grizzard -- pronounced griz-ZARD -- wrote a column four days a week for the 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution and was syndicated in 450 newspapers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 A fiercely proud Southerner whose columns played redneck humor to the hilt, 
Grizzard took special delight in attacking Yankees, draft evaders and 
feminists. He often devoted his column to letters from readers he had enraged. 
</P>
<P>
 His greatest ire was directed at Georgia Tech, the football rival of his 
beloved alma mater, the University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 He also poked fun at his marital problems, and wrote, often movingly, about 
his late parents. He married Dedra Kyle, his fourth wife, in a hospital room 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 His third wife, Kathy Schmook, retaliated for his barbs in her own book in 
1988, "How to Tame a Wild Bore," in which she tattled that Grizzard wore the 
same underwear for weeks, hated kids, snored and was such a hypochondriac that 
he feared a popcorn kernel was a tumor on his gum. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his female followers considered him cute, even Grizzard conceded that 
as a kid he was so homely that his nickname was "D.U." for "Doubly Ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Grizzard was hailed as a "Faulkner for plain folks" and "this generation's 
Mark Twain." 
</P>
<P>
 His book "My Daddy Was a Pistol and I'm a Son of a Gun," a memoir of his 
father, was his favorite of his 20 books. 
</P>
<P>
 Other books, many of them collections of his columns, had similarly beguiling 
titles, such as "Elvis is Dead And I Don't Feel So Good Myself" and "Don't Bend 
Over in the Garden, Granny, You Know Them Taters Got Eyes." Total sales ran 
into the millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Grizzard even poked fun at his health problems. "They Tore Out My Heart and 
Stomped That Sucker Flat," about his first heart operation in 1982, became his 
highest-selling book. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a popular figure on the lecture circuit, commanding up to $20,000 a 
speech. He would occasionally appear on television, including guest spots on 
the "Tonight Show" and "Designing Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Grizzard was born in Ft. Benning, Ga., and grew up in Moreland, about 45 miles 
southwest of Atlanta, after his father left his mother when he was 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Before launching his humor column in 1978, Grizzard was sports editor with the 
Athens (Ga.) Daily News, executive sports editor with the Atlanta Journal, 
assistant city editor with the Atlanta Journal and executive sports editor at 
the Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
 He chronicled his newspaper career in a book whose title summed up his 
feelings about the South: "If I Ever Get Back to Georgia, I'm Gonna Nail My 
Feet to the Ground."

 Irvin Flores, 69, one of the Puerto Rican nationalist leaders who attacked the 
U.S. Congress in 1954. Flores spent 25 years in federal prisons for the March 
1, 1954, attack in which five congressmen were injured.In 1950, he was briefly 
incarcerated for his alleged role in the island's nationalist rebellion. After 
his release, he moved to New York to join independence leader Rafael Cancel 
Miranda, who introduced him to Lolita Lebron and Andres Figueroa Cordero. 
Together they carried out the attack, shooting at U.S. representatives from a 
second-floor balcony in the Capitol. All four were imprisoned until they were 
pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. "Of the four, Irvin was the only 
member of the working class, a defender of workers' movements, not an 
intellectual," historian Mini Seijo Bruno said. "He is the one that best 
represents the people of Puerto Rico." In San Juan on Saturday of cancer.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; TULSA'S ONE-TWO PUNCH IS FOR REAL; 
MIDWEST: AFTER KNOCKING OUT UCLA, GOLDEN HURRICANE ELIMINATES OKLAHOMA STATE 
AND MOVES TO ROUND OF 16. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rafael Maldenado, who is 6 feet 11 and doesn't need to look any taller, stood 
on top of a press row table anyway and led cheers for the Tulsa Golden 
Hurricane, Oklahoma's newest sweetheart in the Sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa completed its one-two Midwest Regional sweep of UCLA and Oklahoma State 
and earned its first trip to the NCAA tournament's round of 16 by knocking the 
Cowboys off their saddles, 82-80, Sunday at the Myriad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricane, which was seeded No. 12 in the region, defeated the No. 5- and 
No. 4-seeded teams in a span of three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an emotional roller-coaster," said Tulsa Coach Tubby Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, it's been a totally unexpected joyride for the Hurricane of 
the Missouri Valley Conference after taking down better-known teams from 
better-known conferences such as the Pacific 10 and Big Eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa (23-7) trailed by 13 points in the first half and by 13 points again in 
the second half, but made a key defensive change to corral 7-foot, 290-pound 
Bryant (Big Country) Reeves, then made two three-point shots in the last 1:41 
to pull off another upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves scored 32 points, but he was not nearly as much of a factor down the 
stretch once Smith made his critical defensive adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith told Gary Collier and Shea Seals to back off their defensive assignments 
and position themselves in front of Reeves at all times, not just when he had 
the ball, which was the first-half strategy when Reeves dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we decided to bag that," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State (24-10) played without starter Fred Burley, who was suspended 
by Coach Eddie Sutton for violating an undisclosed team rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cowboys led by 11 points at the half, 52-39 early in the second half 
and 78-77 with 1:29 to play when Randy Rutherford made a three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:01 to play, Lou Dawkins missed the front end of a one-and-one, but 
Collier got inside Rutherford, snagged the rebound and scored quickly for a 
79-78 Tulsa lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a fundamental error, something that never should have happened," 
Sutton said. "But give credit to Collier for making a great play." 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma State dumped the ball inside to Reeves, but his short jumper rolled 
off the front of the rim with 41 seconds to play. The Hurricane moved the ball 
upcourt, but not quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier dribbled to work the clock down, then spotted Dawkins as he moved 
toward the lane and faded to the left corner. Collier passed the ball to 
Dawkins, then watched him launch a three-pointer as Sean Sutton made a late 
rush. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball came down cleanly through the hoop with 8.7 seconds left and Dawkins 
raised both arms as he ran back downcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it went through, I just loved it," Dawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves tipped in a missed shot with 1.4 seconds remaining and the Cowboys 
called time out, but Tulsa inbounded the ball on a long pass to Maldenado and 
the clock ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Collier finished with 25 points and Alvin Williamson had 20 for Tulsa, which 
made 12 of 22 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've proven to be a good basketball team, beating UCLA and beating us," 
Sutton said. "They're capable of beating anyone if they shoot the ball like 
that."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; THESE EAGLES PRODUCE OWN HIGHLIGHT 
REEL; EAST: BOSTON COLLEGE STUNS NORTH CAROLINA, 75-72, AFTER WATCHING 
VIDEOTAPE OF FOOTBALL TEAM'S UPSET OF NOTRE DAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Early Sunday afternoon, hours before ninth-seeded Boston College would deliver 
the upset of the NCAA tournament, Eagle Coach Jim O'Brien asked his players to 
report to a room at the team hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 As a charter bus waited outside to take them to their East Regional 
second-round game against top-ranked North Carolina, O'Brien turned to his team 
and said, "If you believe in yourselves, this can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, a videotape was popped into a VCR and soon the Eagles were watching 
highlights of Boston College's remarkable 41-39 football victory over 
top-ranked Notre Dame last November. For about seven minutes, the tape rolled 
on and as it did, the room grew more quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 At tape's end, a single word appeared on the screen: 
</P>
<P>
 Believe.  
</P>
<P>
 Boston College did more than that. It won, 75-72, but only after North 
Carolina freshman center Rasheed Wallace, who hadn't attempted a three-pointer 
the entire season, found himself with the ball and a chance to tie the score at 
the buzzer. He missed badly, sending the Eagles to their first Sweet 16 
appearance since 1985 and sending the Tar Heels home this early for the first 
time since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very stunned," said North Carolina forward Jerry Stackhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith did what he could to defend Wallace's decision, even going so far as to 
comment on the freshman's outside shooting during recent practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been shooting very well," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is one thing to shoot a couple of lazy three-pointers in workouts and 
quite another to try your first real three-point attempt as the clock ticks 
down and Boston College defenders are rushing toward you. Worse yet, Wallace 
had guards Jeff McInnis and Donald Williams positioned nearby for the final 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised he didn't throw it to McInnis," said Smith, realizing it was 
useless to pretend he was pleased with Wallace. After all, McInnis had made 
three of four three-point shots Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Smith probably would argue that the Eagles' victory had more to do with 
thuggery than Wallace's last-second goof or any sort of video inspiration. 
That's because Derrick Phelps, his senior point guard and the team's best 
defender, spent the last 15:53 sitting on the bench, dazed from a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, as well as the 18,922 fans who squeezed into drafty USAir Arena, 
watched in horror as beefy Eagle forward Danya Abrams performed a mid-air body 
slam on Phelps as the Tar Heel playmaker glided toward the basket for a 
breakaway layup. Phelps crumpled to the court, sparking an angry exchange of 
words, threats and finger-pointing from the North Carolina players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Gesturing toward the 6-foot-7, 265-pound Abrams, Smith had to be restrained 
after rushing onto the court. Tar Heel center Eric Montross, visibly upset by 
the sight of Phelps writhing in pain, told a cameraman not to intrude and later 
shoved the mini-cam away. Other Tar Heel players yelled at Abrams as the 
freshman was summoned to the bench by O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no place in basketball for that," Smith said of Abrams' intentional 
foul.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Smith said he had warned his team beforehand that "No. 24," as he 
called him, was known for his rough and sometimes questionable methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw him step on (Georgetown center Othella) Harrington's toes on tape," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams, who finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds, actually seemed pleased 
that Smith had singled him out for his play. 
</P>
<P>
 "For him to say something like that, I take it as a compliment," Abrams said. 
"I don't mind at all. As long as I get the job done, I don't care what they 
call me." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams insisted that he wasn't trying to injure Phelps, who weighs nearly 100 
pounds less than the Eagle forward. Instead, Abrams said he simply wanted to 
send a message. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you come down the lane, you're going to pay for it," he said, adding 
later, "I'm not a bad guy here. I'm just going out and playing well." 
</P>
<P>
 To O'Brien, the entire incident smacked of North Carolina whining. Yes, he 
said, it was an intentional foul. Yes, he wished it wouldn't have happened. 
Yes, the officials made the right call by sending the Tar Heels to the line for 
two free throws and allowing them to retain possession of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But his Boston College team a collection of thugs? Not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had the best basketball win in the history of Boston College and 
we're having to defend ourselves against rough play from a team like that?" 
O'Brien said. "Please." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the foul, the Eagles led, 50-40. But the enraged Tar Heels 
responded with a 13-3 run and tied the score with 10:59 to play. This was about 
the same time that North Carolina distanced itself from Liberty in the first 
round.  
</P>
<P>
 Not this time, though. Guard Gerrod Abram (21 points) kept making three-point 
shots and 6-9 center Bill Curley (18 points) kept finding ways to score despite 
having to contend with the 7-0 Montross, the 7-0 Kevin Salvadori or the 6-10 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Williams, who all but won the NCAA championship for North Carolina 
last season, was suffering through an awful shooting slump. He made two of 12 
shots, none of six from beyond the three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just one of those days," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Boston College, it was something else altogether -- like an upset for the 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta believe," said Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina does.

LAKERS RETAIN THEIR MAGIC TOUCH, 97-91; PRO BASKETBALL: L.A. IMPROVES TO 3-1 
AGAINST ORLANDO AS THREATT SCORES 30 POINTS. O'NEAL HAS 29 POINTS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Lakers leaned into the wind of a Shaq Attack again Sunday night and lived 
to tell, going far beyond survival in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 This is nothing new, of course, only the latest installment. Shaquille O'Neal 
gets his big night and the Lakers get the victory, this time by 97-91 before 
17,505 at the Forum to improve to 3-1 against his Orlando Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal scored 29 points, making 12 of 19 shots and five of 10 free throws to 
go with 16 rebounds. He averages 29 points and 15.6 rebounds and shoots 69% 
against the Lakers, but has little to show for it in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team that plays the Orlando Magic plays way above their head," O'Neal 
said. "They were pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal and the sellout crowd he pulled in, the first at the Forum since 
opening night, were the obvious factors. Then the Lakers took it from there, 
getting a game-high 30 points from Sedale Threatt, 20 points and 13 rebounds 
from Elden Campbell and 19 points and 10 rebounds from Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal had nine points and five rebounds in the fourth quarter, only to be 
undercut by Threatt, a 6-foot-2 guard. His three-point play gave the Lakers a 
10-point lead with 4:25 remaining and his baseline jumper while falling over 
the end line with 2:55 left opened an eight-point cushion.  
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, it came down to one shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic had closed within 91-89 at that stage, prompting the Lakers to call 
a timeout with 51 seconds left. Standing in front of the Laker bench, George 
Lynch threw the ball in to Threatt along the baseline. Anfernee Hardaway, 
Orlando's 6-7 guard, stood between Threatt and the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me a step," Threatt said. "I guess he thought I was going to drive. 
That's my game. I'll take that shot any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Including this one, launching the 16-footer over Hardaway's outstretched arm. 
When it went in with 48 seconds to go, the Lakers had a 93-89 lead and what 
turned out to be the winning points. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a read by Sedale," Laker Coach Randy Pfund said. "He had a couple of 
options. But we put the ball in Sedale's hands and know there was a chance 
something good was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers readied for the arrival of O'Neal and his 31.1 points, 15.4 
rebounds and 57.1% shooting in the 17 games after the All-Star break with the 
usual Shaq Rules. Keep the ball out of his hands as much as possible -- that 
worked in the fourth quarter to key a December victory in Orlando -- and don't 
let him get position an arm's length from the basket. And, if all else fails, 
foul rather than concede layups, because free throws are a glaring weak spot in 
the arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, you don't get him mad," Pfund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or hope you win in spite of it -- O'Neal averaged 29 points and 15.7 rebounds 
and shot 71.1% in his first three games against the Lakers. The time, he had 
six rebounds and 12 points, going six of 11 from the field and missing both 
attempts from the line in the first half, but Orlando trailed at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 That pace never changed. O'Neal played on, but the Lakers played through. 
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 It still appears Shaquille O'Neal will fill one of the final two spots on the 
Dream Team II roster for this summer's world championships, even though no 
agreement has been reached among sponsors. NBA officials met last week with 
representatives from Pepsi, which has an exclusive soft drink contract for 
O'Neal's services, in an attempt to resolve the deadlock created because 
Coca-Cola is one of the sponsors for the world championships and one of the 
clauses in the Pepsi deal is that he can not appear in Coke ads. An 
announcement by USA Basketball on the final two spots -- with Danny Manning and 
Jeff Hornacek also possibilities -- is expected a week from today. . . . James 
Edwards rejoined the Lakers after skipping the last five games to be with his 
sick mother in Seattle. . . . With 11 assists Wednesday against Washington and 
10 on Friday against New Jersey, Nick Van Exel became the first Laker to reach 
double figures in that category in a year.

CLIPPERS POWERED BY SPENCER; PRO BASKETBALL: ENIGMATIC CENTER HAS 24 POINTS AND 
EIGHT REBOUNDS IN 114-110 VICTORY OVER THE TRAIL BLAZERS.

 Elmore Spencer, a 7-foot center, might be the Clippers' biggest enigma. 
</P>
<P>
 Capable of dominating a game, he can just as easily vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, who had career highs of 28 points and 14 rebounds in a 10-point 
victory against the Sacramento Kings on Feb. 25, has been inconsistent since, 
averaging 6.3 points and 5.3 rebounds in his last 10 games. He was benched for 
the second half of last Tuesday night's victory over the Utah Jazz because he 
was unable to contain center Felton Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 But matched against Portland center Cliff Robinson in Sunday night's game 
against the Trail Blazers, Spencer scored 24 points and grabbed eight rebounds 
as the Clippers won, 114-110, before an announced crowd of 13,531 at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Spencer) had a great game," said Clipper forward Dominique Wilkins, who had 
26 points and eight rebounds. "When you get that kind of effort out of him 
every night it makes us that much tougher because they have to play him in the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely need that from him every night, and he has the ability to do 
that. He has to come out and believe in himself and play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring nine points in the first half, Spencer had 15 points and five 
rebounds in the second as the Clippers (24-39) won for the fifth time in six 
games to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. They trail the Denver Nuggets 
(32-32) by 7 1/2 games in the race for the eighth and final Western Conference 
playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have won four of their last five home games, open a six-game 
Eastern trip Tuesday against the New Jersey Nets at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've shown that we can win at home, we just have to show that we can win on 
the road," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Clippers leading, 112-109, after Trail Blazer forward Buck Williams 
made two free throws with 1:18 to play, Spencer dunked off a no-look flip from 
Ron Harper to give the Clippers a 114-109 lead with 1:06 remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who had averaged 32 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 3.6 steals 
over the last five games, had 22 points, seven rebounds, nine assists and five 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who missed 12 of 22 shots in Thursday's 102-99 loss to Denver, 
continued to struggle, making 10 of 25 shots. But Wilkins, who missed four of 
five shots in the third quarter, got hot when it counted, making three of four 
shots and scoring nine points in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers also got a good contribution from their bench as reserve forward 
Harold Ellis made his first five shots and scored 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, at 105-105, after Harvey Grant, who had 28 points, made a 
jumper with 3:50 remaining, the Clippers scored five points in a row to take a 
110-105 lead. Harper made a free throw after he was fouled by Grant, who 
committed his sixth foul with 3:40 remaining, and scored on a layin with 3:12 
left to give the Clippers a 108-105 lead. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins, whose agent revealed Saturday that he has broken off 
contract talks with the Clippers, said he won't let the stalled talks affect 
his performance. "I'm just going to continue to come out and play ball, I'm not 
going to worry about that too much anymore," said Wilkins, who could become an 
unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. "I'll just do what I have to 
do and go from there." . . . The Clippers activated forward Loy Vaught, who had 
sat out the last six games because of a strained right hip flexor. Vaught had 
no points and no rebounds in 10 minutes as a reserve. To make room for Vaught, 
the Clippers placed Tom Tolbert on the injured list because of a lower back 
strain. Tolbert will be eligible to return to the active roster on March 28.

MORNING BRIEFING: GRIPES ABOUT HIS TATTOOS ARE GETTING UNDER RODMAN'S SKIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an interview with Inside Sports magazine, Dennis Rodman of the San Antonio 
Spurs questioned whether he should be considered strange for having so many 
tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people think my tattoos are strange," he said, "they should name a city 
Tattooville, USA, and put everybody with a tattoo there. It'd be so 
overpopulated, people would have to wait in line to use their own bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't even be the mayor there -- I'd probably be just a street cleaner. 
In Tattooville, nobody cares if you got a tattoo. They think you're different 
if you don't have one."

 Makes sense, or does it?

 Bruin update: It has been reported that UCLA's 112-102 loss to Tulsa was the 
most points given up in a regulation game in Bruin history. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record was 110 in a 110-83 loss to Illinois at the outset of the

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Considering that Gordie Howe hasn't scored a goal since 1980, it was a pretty 
good bet that Wayne Gretzky eventually would catch him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But leave it to the Great One to add the surprise element to the inevitable, 
the 801st goal of his career coming when it seemed that the Kings would lose to 
San Jose and perhaps blow all hope of reaching the playoffs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky tied Howe and the Kings tied the Sharks with 49 seconds left Sunday. 
With 12 games left, Gretzky undoubtedly will pass Howe. And, who knows, the 
Kings might even pass the Sharks. They have a favorable schedule, experience 
and No. 99 on their side. . . . * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harrick isn't making this business of trying to be the voice of reason any 
easier for me. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He did a lousy job of preparing UCLA for the NCAA tournament. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't so much that the Bruins lost to Tulsa -- a dangerous 12th-seeded 
team playing in its home state and an upset winner over Oklahoma State on 
Sunday -- but how. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins trailed by 29 points not long after removing their warm-ups, and 
the game wasn't nearly as close as the 112-102 score indicated. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A team that began the season 14-0 and was voted No. 1 in the nation in late 
January split its last 14 games and might not be ranked in the top 25 if there 
were a poll this week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As the schedule got tougher, the Bruins got weaker. Their opponents made 
adjustments. They didn't. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The rap against Harrick-coached teams is that they don't improve. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Their intensity level seems to drop. . . .

<P>
 I mean, you don't often find the words inspired and Bruins in the same 
sentence. It was as though they were playing Oregon again Friday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They rarely win games they shouldn't and often lose games they shouldn't. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 But, no, I don't agree with the radio talk-show callers who think Harrick 
should be strung by a rope -- or even fired. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA athletic department is in no financial position to buy out the last 
three years of a contract it extended last March. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, too many changes and mistakes have been made at UCLA since John 
Wooden retired after the 1975 season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Would Harrick's successor be any better than most of his predecessors? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former assistant Denny Crum would still be coaching in Westwood if he had been 
signed after Wooden. But Gene Bartow was picked, to be followed by Gary 
Cunningham, Larry Brown, Larry Farmer, Walt Hazzard and Harrick. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Harrick has improved as a recruiter, and his class that includes 6-foot-11 
center omm'A Givens, 6-9 J.R. Henderson, 6-4 Kris Johnson and 6-4 Toby Bailey 
is rated among the best in the nation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Only starting guard Shon Tarver and backup center Rodney Zimmerman probably 
will be missing from a team that was well-stocked with potential NBA players, 
but finished 21-7 and was eliminated in the first round of the tournament. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Harrick says his record speaks for itself. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now it is his job to raise it from the whisper of the 1993-94 season. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Thumbs-up to the one local men's coach who did have his players ready for the 
postseason: Tom Asbury of Pepperdine. The undermanned Waves won the West Coast 
Conference tournament and then took Michigan into overtime. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC, which was on a roll, should have been able to handle Fresno State in the 
first round of the National Invitation Tournament. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina underachieved, not a first for Dean Smith. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Biggest flop opening day of the tournament was Jason Kidd, who was four for 17 
from the floor, had a below-par seven assists and didn't do much at crunch time 
during California's loss to Wisconsin Green Bay. But the Bears could wind up a 
winner if Kidd decides to stay in school another year after the disappointment. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Marquette? I thought the Warriors quit playing basketball when Al McGuire 
retired from coaching. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Say what you want about Bob Knight, but perhaps no other coach could have 
gotten Indiana past the second round. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter became a Kentucky Derby candidate by winning the $200,000 
San Felipe Stakes Sunday at Santa Anita, but the reputation of neither Brocco 
nor Valiant Nature was tarnished on a tiring, muddy track. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The NFL should outdo the NCAA by not only adopting the two-point conversion, 
but outlawing the one-point conversion.

TENNIS; SAMPRAS MAKES AGASSI PAY FOR HIS SPORTING GESTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Sampras can credit his latest tournament title to aces and Andre Agassi's 
sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Sampras delivered seven aces in his final two service games and 
defeated Agassi, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3, in Sunday's final of the Lipton Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the match was delayed an hour because Sampras had a stomach 
ailment. Agassi agreed to the delay, even though the rules permitted him to win 
in a walkover when Sampras was unable to take the court at the scheduled time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't beat the best player in the world, I don't deserve the trophy," 
Agassi said. "And I certainly don't deserve it if I can't beat him when he's 
sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi's decision to decline the walkover cost him $114,000, the difference 
between first- and second-place prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, who earned $242,000 and his fourth title this year, said he 
appreciated Agassi's gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showed me a lot of class, and it's something I'll never forget," Sampras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras awoke Sunday feeling sick and blamed a pasta dinner. He received 
intravenous fluids for 90 minutes before taking the court on an empty stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as surprised as everyone in this room that I won," he said during a 
postmatch news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi was surprised, too. He saw Sampras before the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked a lot worse then than he did in the third set," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of fading during the 2-hour 14-minute match in warm, humid weather, 
Sampras finished strong. He delivered three aces to hold serve for a 5-2 lead 
in the third set, then fired four aces in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras became the first player to win two consecutive Lipton championships in 
men's singles. He improved his record to 23-2 this year, the best start of his 
career.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; VICTORY PUTS DUKE IN A FAMILIAR 
POSITION; SOUTHEAST: HILL LEADS WAY AS BLUE DEVILS DEFEAT MICHIGAN STATE, 
85-74, TO REACH ROUND OF 16 FOR EIGHTH TIME IN NINE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All-American Grant Hill and the Duke defense took Shawn Respert out of the 
game early, and by the time the Michigan State star broke loose, it was too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils shut out the high-scoring Respert until early in the second 
half of an 85-74 victory Sunday in the second round of the NCAA Southeast 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Working hard on both ends, Hill also had 25 points to send Duke (25-5) into 
the round of 16 for the eighth time in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this isn't the Duke of past years," Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote 
said. "It is a really good Duke team with a great, great player." 
</P>
<P>
 Cherokee Parks scored 24 points and Antonio Lang had 16 for the second-seeded 
Blue Devils, who will play Marquette in Knoxville, Tenn., on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Respert, averaging nearly 25 points, was held to only one shot in the first 
half and forced into six turnovers. His first basket came with 16:49 to play 
and cut the Spartans' deficit to four points, the closest they would come the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a late flurry in which Respert scored 16 of the Spartans' last 18 points 
enabled him to finish with 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a long while to figure out what I needed to do against them," Respert 
said. "You have to give Duke credit for playing the type of defense they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill handled most of the job, guarding Respert one on one. But when Respert 
was able to work through an elaborate set of screens and seemed free, Marty 
Clark or Cris Collins or Lang rushed to cover him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a Respert-awareness out there," Hill said. "It wasn't just me, it was 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The game may have been the last for Heathcote. The 66-year-old coach led the 
Spartans to a 20-12 record this season and has said he will decide in a few 
months whether to retire after 18 seasons at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the regular season, an associate athletic director at Michigan State 
sent a memo to the school president suggesting that Heathcote be pressured to 
resign or be fired. But shortly thereafter, university President M. Peter 
McPherson said the coach would decide when to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said forever and forever all year I'll weigh several factors and make a 
decision in mid-summer," Heathcote said. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been talk, too, that Respert might leave after this season. The 
junior's struggles against Duke may have changed his mind about the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is proof that Shawn Respert is not ready," he said. "Maybe I'm not able 
to take over a game the way Grant Hill did today." 
</P>
<P>
 Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, who relied on his outside shooters to defeat Texas 
Southern in the first round, 82-70, vowed to go inside to Parks and Hill 
against the Spartans. The strategy worked as Duke built a 10-point lead late in 
the first half, helped by the dominating defense on Respert. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were shocked we were able to do that," Krzyzewski said. "They had a very 
physical game against Seton Hall in the first round. He may have been a little 
tired. In the second half, he showed his true colors." 
</P>
<P>
 Respert scored 16 points in the final five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke made 15 of 16 free throws in the last three minutes and never led by 
fewer than seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke became the second of five Atlantic Coast Conference teams in the NCAA 
tournament to reach the round of 16, joining Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss by Kentucky in the earlier game prevented any rematch between the 
Wildcats and Duke. They met two years ago in one of the greatest college games 
ever, a 104-103 overtime victory by the Blue Devils in the East Regional final 
on a last-second shot by Christian Laettner after a long pass from Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State was one of seven Big Ten schools picked for the tournament. 
Purdue, Indiana and Michigan advanced to the regional semifinals, but the 
Spartans were denied their first trip to the final 16 since 1989-90.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; NO SPARKS FLY AS INDIANA BEATS 
TEMPLE; EAST: COACHES KNIGHT AND CHANEY HUG INSTEAD OF FIGHTING AS THE HOOSIERS 
ADVANCE, 67-58. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In case you are wondering, Indiana beat Temple, 67-58, and now advances to the 
East Regional semifinal in Miami, where the Hoosiers will play Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
 But enough of that. America wants to know about the Mt. Vesuvius Twins, 
Indiana Coach Bob Knight and Temple Coach John Chaney. The two lovable 
newsmakers faced each other Sunday for the first time in their combined 51 
years of coaching, which prompted all sorts of pregame hoopla and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Would Knight unveil the notorious bullwhip for old times' sake? 
</P>
<P>
 Would Chaney issue any more "I'll-kill-you" threats? 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh, yes, would Indiana be able to solve Temple's famed matchup zone and 
would the Owls be able to continue to survive on the play of guards Eddie Jones 
and Aaron McKie? 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the answers were less exciting than the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 To watch the pre-tipoff hug-fest between Knight and Chaney was to think the 
two men were lifelong friends. As cameras clicked away and the crowd watched 
with mouths agape, Knight put his arm around Chaney and began talking into his 
ear. Chaney nodded a lot, hugged Knight back, then left.  
</P>
<P>
 But rather than return to his bench, the disoriented Chaney started to walk 
toward the Hoosiers before realizing his mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney can be forgiven for being a little lightheaded. Not only did he have to 
deal with Knight's unexpected display of public affection and respect, he also 
had to beat the solid Hoosiers with only three weapons: his beloved matchup 
zone and Jones and McKie. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't near enough. Jones scored 24 points and McKie contributed 18, but 
the rest of the fourth-seeded Owls were on spring vacation. No other Temple 
player broke double digits and that includes point guard Rick Brunson, who 
checked out with a three-of-12 day from the field, and much-maligned center 
William Cunningham, who scored eight points and had seven rebounds in the first 
half, one point and two rebounds in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-seeded Indiana had its own problems, but not as many as Temple. Point 
guard Damon Bailey had a pulled muscle in his side, forward Brian Evans was 
playing despite a brace on his right shoulder, forward Pat Graham was running 
with a presumed broken foot and later, freshman guard Sherron Wilkerson (of 
Knight head-butt fame) suffered a broken leg five minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hoosiers did have two distinct advantages: An actual bench and the 
best three-point shooting (by percentage) team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 It showed, too, as the Hoosiers made 10 of their 20 three-pointers and placed 
four players in double figures. Evans had 18, Alan Henderson had 12, Todd 
Leary, who was benched at the start of the second half, but returned when 
Wilkerson was hurt, had 15 and Graham had 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple stayed closed until midway through the second half. But Jones and McKie 
couldn't do everything, although they tried. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Chaney tried to remain philosophical. If nothing else, he will 
always have The Hug. 
</P>
<P>
 "Facing Bobby Knight today was something that . . . only Bobby Knight and 
myself . . . could appreciate," he said. "It was a great pleasure to go up 
against a master in this business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (Knight and Chaney) felt like warriors ourselves. I wish I could have shot 
a jump shot, though."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; REEVES POWERS ARIZONA INTO ROUND OF 
16; WEST: SENIOR GUARD SCORES 21 OF HIS 30 POINTS IN SECOND HALF OF 71-58 
VICTORY OVER VIRGINIA. 
</P>

<P>
 The defensive specialist that Khalid Reeves had not heard of got the best of 
him in the first half. The second half belonged to Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves burned Cornel Parker for 21 of his 30 points in the second half Sunday, 
leading Arizona into the NCAA tournament's round of 16 with a 71-58 victory 
over Virginia in the West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the first half I wasn't moving with the ball," Reeves said. "I 
came into the second half knowing I'm always aggressive in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just played my heart out." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker picked up his third foul early in the second half and couldn't keep a 
lid on Reeves, who a day earlier had responded "Cornel who?" when asked about 
the Virginia senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew I had two fouls," Parker said. "After I picked up my third, I guess I 
was pretty timid the rest of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Reeves: "He's a great defender, but he just didn't play the way he did in 
the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 Not by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves opened the second half by scoring the first six points for the 
second-seeded Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 He made 10 of 20 shots, 10 of 13 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona, a first-round loser the last two years, advanced to a game against 
Louisville on Thursday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 While Reeves stayed busy penetrating seventh-seeded Virginia's defense, the 
rest of the Wildcats dominated the rebounding and held the Cavaliers scoreless 
for 7:37 late in the game. By the time Harold Deane's jump shot ended 
Virginia's drought with 2:20 to play, Arizona (27-5) held a 62-48 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves' backcourt mate, Damon Stoudamire, scored 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody said coming in they had the best backcourt in the country, and I 
don't think you'll get a lot of disagreement from us," Virginia Coach Jeff 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Owes had 15 points and 10 rebounds and Joseph Blair added 12 rebounds for 
the Wildcats. Arizona Coach Lute Olson said his team's 47-46 rebounding edge, 
especially its 36 rebounds at the defensive end, was the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defensive rebounding was critical," he said. "Virginia is a tremendous 
offensive-rebounding team, but we got some of our own." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Burrough led the Cavaliers (18-13) with 20 points, but missed 13 of 22 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia made only 31% of its shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona used a 20-2 run late in the first half to take a 33-26 halftime lead. 
But the Cavaliers got back in the game with a 13-2 spurt, cutting the Wildcats' 
lead to 41-39 with 15:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Reeves took over, scoring nine consecutive points. He capped his romp 
with a tough bank shot and grabbed a defensive rebound at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, the Wildcats fell behind, 21-13, then scored 16 consecutive 
points. Stoudamire had nine points during the run while Arizona controlled the 
defensive rebounding and pressed the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They increased their defensive intensity and tried to pressure the basketball 
more," Jones said. "We tried to rush things." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves, who leads the Wildcats with a 24-point average, scored only three 
points in the game's first 17 minutes while being guarded by Parker. But 
Reeves, who scored 32 points in a first-round victory over Loyola of Maryland, 
got loose for three consecutive baskets while Parker sat out the final three 
minutes of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves' dunk gave Arizona a 33-23 lead with 50 seconds left.

LOUISVILLE SOLO SHOW IS ENOUGH; WEST: MORTON IS THE ONLY CARDINAL WORTH HIS 
SALT, BUT HIS SHOOTING STOPS MINNESOTA, 60-55.

<P>
 Louisville's Dwayne Morton was too much for Minnesota to handle on Sunday, 
leading the Cardinals to a 60-55 victory in the second round of the West 
Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton tied an NCAA regional record by making all five of his three-point 
shots and led all scorers with 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than a free throw in the closing seconds, Morton did not miss, making 
all seven of his shots from the field and seven of eight free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was only one guy on our team who played as well as he was capable of 
playing -- that was Dwayne," said Louisville Coach Denny Crum, whose team made 
11 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Louisville (28-5) will play Arizona (27-5) on Thursday night at 
the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The seesaw game saw many lead changes and featured 19 three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton's final three-pointer gave Louisville the lead for good, 56-55, with 
1:20 to play, and his two free throws iced the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Voshon Lenard led sixth-seeded Minnesota (21-12) with 20 points, including 
four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 With All-American and leading scorer Clifford Rozier being double- and 
triple-teamed, Crum ordered the offense redirected toward Morton, who averaged 
14.9 points during the season. A senior from Louisville, Morton scored only 11 
points and made only three of 10 shots in a first-round victory over Boise 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Crum said he told Rozier at halftime that he needed to pass the ball 
outside if Louisville was to score against Minnesota's tough defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was just my day," Morton said. "I had to step up and be assertive." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Osborne was second among Louisville scorers with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville set the tone by sinking three-point shots for its first two 
baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins said he was proud of his team, even though the 
Golden Gophers squandered a 34-22 halftime lead and scored only 21 points in 
the second half, when they shot only 32%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leads in the college game today are not safe," Haskins said. "With the 
three-pointers, you've got to play for a full 40 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota shot 50% in the first half, then made only eight of 25 in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't show a lot of patience," Haskins said. "We had our opportunities to 
win the game."

NBA ROUNDUP; CELTICS SHOW THEY'RE A FEW BIRDS SHY OF A FLOCK 
</P>

<P>
 The last year the Boston Celtics had a losing record was 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Bird began playing for them the next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Any more Birds out there? 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics clinched their first losing season in 15 years Sunday with a 
performance that epitomized why they are heading to the draft lottery instead 
of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They shot only 33% and were outrebounded, 58-49, in a 101-80 loss to the 
Atlanta Hawks at the Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Willis had 31 points and 14 rebounds for the Hawks, and Mookie Blaylock 
added 18 points and 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willis is having a great year, he's doing everything we ask him to do," 
Atlanta Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "He's been providing leadership and he's an 
aggressive offensive player." 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Augmon had 13 points and 11 rebounds, but Danny Manning was in foul 
trouble and had only 12 points -- 10 below his season average -- for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier McDaniel had 18 points for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to play when you're winning, but basketball is a lot tougher when 
you're losing," McDaniel said. "When we were 6-2, basketball was fun. We've 
only won 16 games since then and that tells you we don't respond well to 
adversity." 
</P>
<P>
 It also tells you they have had plenty of opportunities to respond. The 
Celtics have lost six games in a row and 19 of 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fairly small effort we gave," center Robert Parish said. "Atlanta is 
one of the top teams in the league and you'd think we'd come out with fire, but 
we were flat and lethargic." 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics went scoreless in the opening 2:34 and missed 10 of their first 12 
shots, allowing Atlanta to open an early 14-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 90, Minnesota 80 -- The Bulls, getting 18 points from Horace Grant, 
overcame some poor early shooting at Minneapolis to maintain their perfect 
record against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago won its fifth in a row while increasing its record against Minnesota 
to 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 103, Philadelphia 101 -- Rookie Vin Baker made a slam dunk with 12 
seconds to play to complete a late rally by the Bucks, who snapped a six-game 
losing streak by beating the 76ers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 124, Charlotte 115 -- Gary Payton scored a career-high 32 points, and 
Shawn Kemp had a triple double for the SuperSonics, who rode a 17-2 
third-period surge to a victory at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp had 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career-best 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall Gill had 22 points against his former team. He also had a brief 
shoving match with the Hornets' Larry Johnson and exchanged unpleasantries with 
Charlotte Coach Allan Bristow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Perkins added 20 points, making four of six three-pointers, for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 132, Washington 99 -- The Nuggets set a season-high for points and 
margin of victory at Denver in rolling over the Bullets, despite a career-high 
39 points by Washington's Rex Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf led Denver scoring with 23 points.

 Purdue kept turning the ball over Sunday and it didn't hurt, but that can't 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for us to get to the Final Four, we have to eliminate our turnovers 
and our bench has got to continue to help us," said Boilermaker Coach Lin Dunn 
after Purdue was an 86-59 winner over Washington in the NCAA West regional at 
West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Purdue got 20 points from freshman Leslie Johnson and 16 from 
Stacey Lovelace in advancing the region semifinals at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boilermakers will play Texas A&M on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am thrilled to death to win a second-round game," Dunn said. "I thought key 
to the game was that they weren't able to produce points off our turnovers, 
even though we had 31 turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
 Jannon Rolland scored 13 points and Cindy Lamping and Tonya Kirk each added 11 
for Purdue (27-4). Washington (21-8) was led by Katia Foucade with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M 75, San Diego St. 72 -- Lisa Branch sank the go-ahead layup in the 
final seconds of overtime to give the Aggies (23-7) a 73-72 lead over the 
Aztecs (26-5) at San Diego and Marianne Miller added two free throws with two 
seconds to play for the final points. MIDWEST REGIONAL 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama 84, Iowa 78 -- Betsy Harris scored 24 points, including six 
three-pointers, to lead the Crimson Tide at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama (24-6) advanced to next Thursday's regional semifinal against 
defending national champion Texas Tech. Iowa ended its season at 21-7. EAST 
REGIONAL 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut 81, Auburn 59 -- Rebecca Lobo scored 21 points and Kara Wolters 
added a career-high 20 as the Huskies beat the Tigers at Storrs, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolters, whose previous best was 19 points, finished 10 for 11 from the field, 
including seven for seven in the first half. Jennifer Rizzotti added 18 points 
for the Huskies (29-2). 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the 20th in a row for Connecticut, seeded No. 1 in the East 
and with a game Thursday against Southern Mississippi at Piscataway, N.J., 
ahead. It gave the Huskies a 19-0 record at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielette Coleman scored 16 points to lead ninth-seeded Auburn (20-10). 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina 63, Old Dominion 52 -- Charlotte Smith scored 15 points and had 
a season-high 16 rebounds before being ejected as the Tar Heels defeated the 
Monarchs at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina center Sylvia Crawley had 13 points and 10 rebounds as the Tar 
Heels (29-2) snapped Old Dominion's 18-game winning streak. The Monarchs (25-6) 
suffering their first loss since a Jan. 13 defeat at No. 1 Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina advanced to a region semifinal game against Vanderbilt on 
Thursday at Piscataway, and the Tar Heels will have to play without Smith, who 
was averaging 15.1 points a game. Her ejection came for fighting Old Dominion's 
Beth McGowan and Deanna Vander Plas.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; LAROCCA REBOUNDS TO BEAT ORANGE COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Josh LaRocca, coming off a poor start, pitched a six-hitter to help Golden 
West to a 10-1 victory over host Orange Coast on Sunday in an Orange Empire 
Conference baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 LaRocca (1-2) didn't allow a hit after the fourth inning.He retired 16 of the 
final 17 he faced, including 14 consecutive batters before a ninth-inning 
error. He had allowed seven earned runs in two innings Tuesday in a loss to 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Flanagan had two hits, including a two-run triple, and Dustin Martin had 
two hits and scored two runs for Golden West (9-11, 3-6). Robert Prince hit his 
first home run for the Rustlers to tie it, 1-1, in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 11th consecutive loss for Orange Coast (3-14, 0-6). 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange Empire Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 6, Riverside 1 -- Rob Crabtree pitched his second consecutive complete 
game for Cypress (18-5, 5-2). Crabtree, a sophomore right-hander, allowed eight 
hits, had 11 strikeouts and didn't allow a walk. He has 24 strikeouts in his 
last two starts and hasn't walked a batter in his last 18 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers scored four runs in the fifth to take a 6-0 lead. After a dropped 
third strike and two errors loaded the bases, Josh Kliner had a sacrifice fly, 
Jason Hodges followed with a two-run double and Andy Gonzales ended the scoring 
with an RBI double. Riverside is 17-4, 7-2.

GOLF ROUNDUP; TWELVE YEARS LATER, ROBERTS FINALLY WINS A TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his 13th year on the PGA Tour, Loren Roberts sat in the clubhouse Sunday 
while the rest of the field of the Nestle Invitational lifted a burden from his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts shot a five-under-par 67 Sunday for a four-round total of 13-under 275 
at Arnold Palmer's Bay Hill Club in Orlando, Fla., and won after Fuzzy Zoeller 
and Vijay Singh faltered on the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was worth $216,000 and much more. At day's end, Roberts was no 
longer the golfer who had won the most money on the tour without winning a 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means getting that big onus off my back," he said. "I've been out here 12 
years and made a lot of money. But that doesn't cut it out here. You're just a 
day laborer until you win." 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller (69) and and Singh (71) shared second at 276 with Nick Price, a winner 
last week in the Honda Classic. Price (70) had a chance to tie Roberts, but 
missed an 18-foot birdie putt on the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, 38, of Memphis, Tenn., was in the clubhouse while first Zoeller and 
then Singh blew a lead over the last two holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller self-destructed, pushing a three-iron shot into the gallery and off 
the bald head of a spectator and into the water on the par-three 17th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had ugly written all over it," Zoeller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Singh bogeyed the 17th and 18th holes to hand the title to Roberts. 
</P>

CSUN'S D'AOUST GETS EARLY SHELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aaron D'Aoust had a week to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll have just as long to analyze the results. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Aoust, making his first scheduled start of the season, gave up seven runs to 
Cal State Sacramento in the first inning Sunday as the Hornets rolled over Cal 
State Northridge, 17-8, in a Western Athletic Conference game at Hornet Field. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Aoust, who earned a surprise start a week earlier and defeated 24th-ranked 
Hawaii, earned a spot in the rotation. For the first time, the former reliever 
had a week to prepare for his start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that had anything to do with it," D'Aoust said. "I felt fine -- 
I just didn't get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 The results, D'Aoust admitted, were disappointing to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much gave them a good foothold," said D'Aoust, a junior transfer 
from Long Beach City College. "They sure got off to a good start." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a rocket leaving the launch pad, in fact. This one started like Friday's 
game ended when Sacramento battered Marco Contreras for seven consecutive hits 
in the eighth inning to come from behind to win, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento, which won two of three in the series, rolled up seven consecutive 
hits to open the bottom of the first and had a 5-0 lead before D'Aoust recorded 
an out. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fire was extinguished, Sacramento led, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the players after the first inning that seven wouldn't be enough," 
Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "And I was right." 
</P>
<P>
 But every time Northridge (15-12, 4-2 in WAC play) got within relative 
striking range, Sacramento (13-11, 3-3) answered -- and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge gave up a season high in runs and tied a season high in hits 
allowed (19). D'Aoust, who had the lowest earned-run average on the team (2.19) 
entering the game, gave up 10 hits and 10 earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, he didn't have it," Kernen said. "He'd pitched well six or seven 
times in a row. Today he got rocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it came early, the game's most important blast was a three-run homer by 
Derek Brown in the second inning that gave Sacramento a 10-1 lead. D'Aoust 
(4-1) was replaced by Jason Vargas to open the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge never got closer than five runs thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas pitched two scoreless innings, but Sacramento jumped all over 
right-hander Evan Howland in the late innings. Howland, a sophomore 
right-hander, gave up seven runs in three innings as the Hornets blew the game 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it was not a great day to be a Matador pitcher. The Sacramento 
runs all were earned, raising the team ERA from 5.29 to 5.76. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kicked our . . . today," Kernen said. "We got blasted." 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Arnold slugged a two-run homer in the eighth as the Matadors scored three 
runs to close within 13-8, but Sacramento scored four more off Howland in the 
bottom half to close the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, catcher Josh Smaler and second baseman Keyaan Cook led the Matadors 
with two hits each. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Aoust, hoping to step forward and assume the role as the team's third 
starter in place of injured Keven Kempton, said he wants another shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen said D'Aoust will get one. "I'm not done," D'Aoust said. "I'm 
definitely not done." Matador Notes 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Jason Shanahan drove in a run in the seventh with a double. He 
has driven in runs in 11 of the past 12 games. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Keyaan Cook has hit safely in eight consecutive games and is 15 
for 30 over that span. Earlier this season, Cook had a streak in which he 
scored in eight consecutive games.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Bentt, who collapsed after losing the World Boxing Organization 
heavyweight title to Herbie Hide, suffered significant injuries to the brain 
and should never fight again, his doctor said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentt, 28, was floored in the third round and again in the seventh when the 
referee counted him out Saturday night at the New London Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Sutcliffe also said Bentt has no memory of the fight nor any event in 
the four to six hours leading up to the bout and that he had a similar collapse 
a month before the fight, though dehydration was blamed for that. 
</P>
<P>
 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentt, who had a long, successful career as an amateur, won the WBO title last 
October in his 12th professional bout with a first-round knockout of Tommy 
Morrison at Tulsa, Okla.

 Nicole Bobek, the 16-year-old replacement for Tonya Harding at the World 
Figure Skating Championships in Chiba, Japan, was eliminated today when she 
failed to survive the qualifying round. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobek, who was told Wednesday she would be competing in Japan, finished 13th 
in her group. She had to be in the top 12 to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding resigned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association last week as part of 
an agreement in which she pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution in the 
investigation into the January attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>

 "My feet just didn't feel under me," said Bobek, who fell on her opening 
triple lutz and took another spill on a triple toe loop. Hockey

 New York Islander forward Brian Mullen, trying to come back from heart 
problems, suffered a seizure at practice in Uniondale, N.Y., the team said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cause of the seizure is unknown, but it is not uncommon in stroke 
victims," the Islanders said in a news release. "He suffered no paralysis and 
no long-term effects and is resting comfortably at North Shore University 
Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullen, 32, suffered a mild stroke last Aug. 11 and underwent surgery to 
repair a small hole in his heart last Sept. 13. He had been taken off blood 
thinners Feb. 16 and had resumed practicing with the team.

 Johann-Olav Koss of Norway capped his season with a gold medal in the combined 
5,000- and 10,000-meter speedskating World Cup events at Heerenveen, 
Netherlands.

 In another race, Manabu Horii of Japan broke the track record in the final 
500-meter World Cup race of the season, clocking 36.25 seconds, and beating Dan 
Jansen, who had already won the overall gold medal.

 The senator intent on stripping baseball of its antitrust exemption critized

 "By refusing to hire a commissioner and by downgrading that job, the owners

Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said. 
</P>

 Metzenbaum was to deliver his statement today at a hearing on baseball's

 Michael Andretti ignored an angry invitation from 1993 IndyCar champion Nigel 
Mansell to "put the boxing gloves on" Sunday and won the Australian IndyCar 
Grand Prix at Surfers Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti averaged 80.994 m.p.h. and led from the start of the race, which was 
delayed 2 hours 20 minutes because of rain and accidents in the warm-up laps. 
The race was ended after 55 laps, 10 fewer than scheduled, because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti, driving for the Chip Ganassi team and using the new Reynard chassis, 
finished 1.33 seconds ahead of Emerson Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Andretti, driving in his final IndyCar season, was third over the 
2.795-mile Paradise street course. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell, who spun out on lap 25 and needed a push to restart, finished ninth, 
a lap behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The near altercation between pole-sitter Mansell and second-place qualifier 
Andretti occurred after Mansell claimed Andretti had cut him off on a pace lap 
before an aborted start. 
</P>
<P>
 Freelance photographer Richard Campion witnessed the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mansell went over to Andretti and pushed him on the shoulder, sort of 
pointing the finger at him," Campion said. "Mansell said, 'Let's settle this 
right now, Michael, let's put the boxing gloves on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Campion said Andretti replied: "It wasn't me, Nigel."

SANTA ANITA; LONGSHOT SOUL OF THE MATTER HITS RIGHT NOTE IN SAN FELIPE STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burt Bacharach said that it was the most bizarre of days. Finishing an 
exhausting concert tour, the Academy Award-winning composer flew from Atlanta 
to Los Angeles on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There I was on the plane, reading a copy of Vanity Fair with Jack Nicholson 
on the cover," Bacharach said. "A few hours later, here I am at Santa Anita, 
and Jack's handing me a trophy. And in between, I'm in the middle of another 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The ground shook at Santa Anita at 1:20 p.m., while the horses for the third 
race were in the tunnel that leads to the track, and at 2:04 Bacharach's colt, 
Soul Of The Matter, registered a shock of his own. While Brocco and Valiant 
Nature, the two favorites, were battling through the stretch in the $208,500 
San Felipe Stakes, Soul Of The Matter and Kent Desormeaux completed a 
successful run from last place to win the 1 1/16-mile race by 2 1/4 lengths. 
The Kentucky Derby had gained a new contender. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bacharach arrived at Santa Anita, the first thing he and trainer Richard 
Mandella needed to discuss was whether Soul Of The Matter should run on a track 
that was gooey from Saturday's 1.15 inches of rain. "I write the songs and Dick 
(Mandella) trains the horses," Bacharach said. "Whatever he decided to do was 
all right with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Another trainer, Charlie Whittingham, had inspected the track and decided to 
keep his San Felipe entrant, Numerous, in the barn. Whittingham had also 
scratched Numerous from a race on Saturday, when the track was sloppy, and on 
Sunday he was saying: "This is a $1.7-million horse, and the track is 
dangerous. The jockeys said the track was spotty. This is the kind of track 
where a horse can hurt a tendon or break something. We'll wait for the Santa 
Anita Derby (on April 9)." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Soul Of The Matter's development has been hampered by a cracked hoof 
on his left foreleg, Mandella decided that the colt was going to run. "If the 
track had been sealed and it had been hard with some grease on top, we would 
have scratched," the trainer said. "We had just put a new patch on the crack a 
few days ago, because the other one wore out. It might have been better for him 
to run on a track that was softer than usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, winning his first stake, won for the third time in five 
starts and paid $14.60 as the third betting choice in a field of five. His time 
was a slow 1:44 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco, winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and second to Valiant Nature in 
the Hollywood Futurity, suffered his second loss. He beat Valiant Nature out of 
third by a head, and it was 16 lengths farther back to Gracious Ghost. Soul Of 
The Matter carried 116 pounds, three less than Brocco and Valiant Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Brocco nor Valiant Nature had run in three months and their trainers 
were reluctant to run because of the mud. To keep them in the race, Santa Anita 
officials had considered switching the San Felipe to a mile on grass. Brocco's 
trainer, Randy Winick, and Ron McAnally, Valiant Nature's trainer, plan to be 
back for the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter had run twice at the meet before Sunday, winning an 
allowance race and running third in a minor grass stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my horse started moving, I felt good," Mandella said of Soul Of The 
Matter's stretch run. "Those other horses had three months off and had a right 
to get tired in this kind of going." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking from the outside post, Valiant Nature was angled to the rail and the 
lead by Laffit Pincay. Pollock's Luck separated Valiant Nature and Brocco down 
the backstretch, with Brocco and Gary Stevens moving closer to the leader on 
the inside as the race reached the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter was last after a half-mile, 10 lengths off the pace. At the 
three-quarter pole, he was still eight lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sat in behind them with dirt in his face, but nothing ever bothers him," 
Desormeaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-stretch, the battle was on up front, with Brocco sticking a head in 
front and Valiant Nature refusing to give up. Soul Of The Matter blew by both 
of them with a sixteenth of a mile left. 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux has ridden Bacharach's colt for all three victories. "He went 
straight as a needle all the way," the jockey said, "but when he got to within 
a half-length of the first two, he tried to lean in. I don't know why. We 
couldn't have had a better setup. I just hope we get the same setup in the next 
one and that we have the same amount of horse under us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella said his colt probably will run next in the Santa Anita Derby, the 
Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland or the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct. The Kentucky 
Derby is May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Bred by Bacharach, Soul Of The Matter is a son of Private Terms and Soul 
Light, whose dam, Icantell, produced Heartlight No. One, the composer's 
champion 3-year-old filly in 1983. Soul Of The Matter was bred in West 
Virginia, a state that's never had a Kentucky Derby winner. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Strodes Creek is expected to join stablemate Numerous for the Santa Anita 
Derby. . . . In the Daily Racing Form's weekly survey of Nevada future books, 
Soul Of The Matter was listed as between 25-1 to 60-1 for the Kentucky Derby, 
with the average odds 40-1. . . . In another 3-year-old race Sunday, Blumin 
Affair, second to Brocco in the Breeders' Cup and fourth in the Hollywood 
Juvenile, ran fourth as his Jack Van Berg-trained stablemate, Cut N. Cruise, 
scored a 20-1 upset. . . . At Golden Gate Fields, Chris Antley rode Southern 
Truce to victory in the $100,000 Miss America Handicap. . . . The only ticket 
with all the winners in the Pick Six was worth $394,948.40.

 The Angels are seriously considering converting Russ Springer to a bullpen 
stopper.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've actually been thinking about it ever since we got him," Angel General 
Manager Bill Bavasi said, "but it's been talked about a lot more lately." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, who retired nine in a row after a leadoff single in his three-inning 
stint of the Angels' 5-2 defeat to the San Diego Padres in Tempe, has started 
only one game this spring. Although he would prefer to start, he says he 
wouldn't mind being a closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I have a role, and they don't have me bouncing back and forth, 
that's fine," Springer said. "Anything beats going back to Vancouver and 
watching it snow for two months." 
</P>
<P>
 If Springer is kept solely as a starter, the Angel bullpen is set: Mike 
Butcher, Joe Grahe, Bill Sampen, Bob Patterson, Lee Guetterman and Scott Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although newly acquired pitcher Mark Leiter can start and relieve, Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers said he is considering Leiter only as a starter. BOB

JAZZ REVIEW; A RICH UNCLE: FESTIVE, FUN, ASTUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the most part, pop/jazz is an aesthetic wasteland. So many of the 
top-selling contemporary groups from the genre hit their audiences with tunes 
that have the kind of sappy, three-notes-up-and-back melodies you hear on TV 
jingles, and the rhythmic oomph of a yawn. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there's Uncle Festive. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by keyboardist Ron Pedley, the quartet played Saturday night at Randell's 
and proved that pop/jazz can be astute and intelligent -- not to mention fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Each selection -- from "Sit and Spin," the second set's medium slow opener, to 
"Incognito" with its big band be-bop bite -- sported an intriguing melody that 
started in one place and arrived gradually at another. These melodies, and the 
subsequent solid solos by Pedley and guitarist Ken Berry, were underpinned by 
crisp, bracing rhythm from bassist Dean Taba and drummer Randy Drake. 
</P>
<P>
 This was plain good jazz, whatever the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the classy elan with which these fellows played, it was surprising to 
learn that the 8-year-old L.A.-based band was playing its first engagement in 
about 18 months (Pedley has been touring with such pop figures as Barry 
Manilow) and that Berry and Taba were subs. Though they were reading charts, 
the musicians played with an appealing tightness that made it sound as if they 
had been working together for months if not years. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a pleasing variety in the tunes offered, all of which were composed 
by Pedley except for "The Last Man," co-written with guitarist John Pondel. 
Many were culled from the band's latest Bluemoon album, "Drive Down the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like the gently moving "Sit and Spin," were psychological in bent. The 
number has a two-faced melody: At first it seems simple and pretty, but it 
segues to a slight undertone of sadness that comes from subtle minor chords and 
gives the piece a richer poignancy. You could imagine it as the theme of a 
French film in which a young woman struggles with her direction in life -- 
stuck in a rut, perhaps, as the title suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Other numbers -- such as "Bob," named for Pedley's cat -- were more fanciful 
and carefree, but that's not to say the composer just knocked off a line and 
was done with it. He took the melody, made up of of small snippets, and moved 
it up, down and around, turning it the way you might look at a jewel in the 
light to reveal all its facets, or the way a cat might look at an object he was 
encountering for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The selections were driven by simultaneously surging and sensitive back beats 
from Drake, who locked in deftly with Taba. Pedley, meanwhile, never stopped 
surprising listeners. Playing electronic synthesizers, he issued a continually 
shifting panorama of tones, sounding like everything from an acoustic grand 
piano and a Fender Rhodes electric to an electronic version of a jazz 
orchestra. And his solos were first rate, each played craftily and building to 
numerous climaxes, telling musical stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sit and Spin" found him employing that grand piano sound and going from 
brief, bluesy phrases to gushes of notes -- a pile of leaves blown by a sudden 
gust of wind. During "The Reveal," he played sparse figures to echo the tune's 
quirky melody, then dropped in sprays of notes and chunky, hammered chords that 
made you sit straight up. "Incognito" was a platform for his be-bop wares; his 
lines were full of natty embellishments and curving, lunging statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry added plenty of punch. His inventive solos delivered a wide spectrum of 
tones -- some as wide as paint from a roller, and as popping as a live wire 
loose on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad that circumstances have kept Uncle Festive out of the limelight. 
Pedley obviously has the creativity and musical acumen to make a name for the 
band and to provide the kind of inspiration that keeps major leaguers on their 
toes.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BLOWDOWN: THE BLUES IN, THROUGH THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By its name, you'd suppose that the eighth annual Blues Harmonica Blowdown 
would be a lung-powered cutting contest, with laurels going to whoever was left 
standing after all the gusts had died down. 
</P>
<P>
 But far from presenting the blues as a zero-sum game that tries to winnow the 
losers from the winners, this satisfying (if, at six hours, overlong) sold-out 
program Saturday night at the Strand suggested that the blues are an open door 
through which musicians of varying temperaments and styles are welcome to 
enter. 
</P>
<P>
 For this evening, at least, player after player and band after band went 
through that door and found something on the other side that brought out the 
vitality in them. 
</P>
<P>
 There were seven acts, with a strong streak of Orange (County, that is) to go 
with the blue. The top of the bill featured the loving but playfully rendered 
traditionalism of the reunited Hollywood Fats Band, the reinvigorated sizzle of 
the recently revamped James Harman Band and the idiosyncratic jamming of Carey 
Bell Harrington, who got his schooling on the 1950s Chicago blues scene that 
the two younger headliners absorbed from afar. 
</P>
<P>
 A solid undercard of Southern California bluesmen featured young veteran 
Robert Lucas, playing a tradition-minded solo-acoustic set, and elderly veteran 
Blind Joe Hill, who looked fragile in a comeback performance after heart 
surgery, but sounded sure and steady when blowing his harp. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmonica Fats, another longtime presence on the Los Angeles blues scene, was 
casual about playing his namesake but made a strong impression with gritty, 
biting vocals and his trademark stage antics. Flat Top Tom and his Jump Cats 
also emphasized showmanship. Their swinging, up-tempo blues were tightly 
played, but the big treat was watching leader Tom Hall and a dance partner do a 
flashy jitterbug. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Fats Band's reunion followed the recent reissue of "Rock This 
House," an obscure late-'70s album that was the L.A./Orange County unit's only 
release. Band leader Michael (Hollywood Fats) Mann died in 1986 at age 32; the 
four other charter members were back, along with a player ideally suited by 
ability and background to stand in for the prodigious Fats (whom Blowdown 
organizer Bernie Pearl recalled in his introduction as "a genius of the 
blues"). 
</P>
<P>
 That would be David (Kid) Ramos, the Anaheim resident who formed an explosive 
blues guitar tandem with Fats in the early- to mid-'80s lineup of the Harman 
Band. Ramos, 35, was amazingly fluent as he probed and skipped across the 
strings of his hollow-body electric guitar. More than expertise, he brings to 
bear the extra presence and snap that separates skillful players from special 
ones. Ramos' solos won ovations, and when playing in a supporting role his 
performance had the same attentive, fully engaged quality that is Hollywood 
Fats' hallmark on the "Rock This House" album. 
</P>
<P>
 That was true of the entire band. Fred Kaplan is a tasty piano player, coyly 
trilling along. Richard Innes is the sort of drummer who makes the players in 
front of him more vivid by lending just the right accent at just the right time 
-- an intensification or drop in dynamic, or a syncopated embellishment that 
provides an always moving, ever-reactive framework for what the soloists are 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In his thin-framed glasses and fedora and with his low-keyed stage manner, 
front man Al Blake called James Joyce to mind more readily than any blues 
forebears. But his performance had all the intensity and range of inflection 
needed to carry music culled from '50s Chicago blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawling here, adding some wryly plaintive intensifying notes there, Blake 
sounded anything but professorial. He opened the show with an unaccompanied 
harmonica segment that showed his range on the instrument, from clean, 
sprightly lines to thick-toned moans. Between songs, the Laguna Beach resident 
displayed a scholar's knowledge and a lover's fondness for the music. Surveying 
the packed house for this year's Blowdown, Blake mused at one point: "Maybe 
next year we'll be at Dodger Stadium. Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not likely. But if the Hollywood Fats Band elects to keep going instead of 
just playing occasional reunions, it would be a classy and no doubt 
well-received addition to any major blues festival. The only thing lacking in 
this set was time. With 45 minutes, the band wasn't able to fit in a headlong, 
jumping burner in which Blake's harp could play a speeding tag game with Ramos' 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 The set's excellence, and particularly Ramos' prominent part in making it so, 
paved the way for some extracurricular drama -- maybe not quite a competitive 
challenge, but an inevitable comparison begging to be made. Next up would be 
the James Harman Band, and with it a new, very young guitar player occupying 
the slot that Ramos himself held for many years until his departure from the 
band in 1988. Inheriting the crowd that the muscular Ramos had just ignited was 
Robby (Sugar Boy) Eason -- blond, slender, and looking every bit his age, which 
is 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to minimize Ramos' excellence in the least, but Eason probably was the 
guitarist who most in the audience went home raving about. Slinging a 
Stratocaster and playing a totally different style than Ramos, the new kid was 
a revelation. With Jimmie Vaughan-style thrust implicit in his playing, the San 
Diego resident betrayed no nervousness, just focused intensity, and he played 
with a combination of vigor, taste and control that by all rights should be 
utterly beyond anyone his age. His solos shot through the room, and his work 
within the ensemble was colorful and energetic. Word is going to get around, 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman himself has never been less than a spirited performer. With Eason and a 
sharp new drummer, Michael Cherry, in his band (as well as solid holdover Jeff 
Turmes on bass and slide guitar), he sounded positively inspired. The 
bandleader from Huntington Beach was at the top of his game both vocally and on 
the harmonica -- shifting hues constantly in a performance brimming with 
free-flowing spontaneity and delight. 
</P>
<P>
 The 65-minute set featured four songs from "Cards on the Table," a new album 
due in mid-May. The opening salvo, "Night Ridin' Daddy," was a striking new 
number, cool yet steamy, coursing with a tense sexuality. Harman kept that 
tension going through the first few songs before moving toward more broadly 
humorous fare including another good new one, "Three Way Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman's two studio albums since the loss of Hollywood Fats and Ramos have 
taken a laid-back, ultra-traditional approach, but material from them sounded 
newly boisterous as well. (The Harman Band will play April 1 at Linda's Doll 
Hut in Anaheim and April 2 at the Heritage Brewing Co. in Dana Point.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carey Bell Harrington (who drops his last name for the stage, performing as 
Carey Bell) turned in a jam-oriented concluding set that showcased his 
virtuosic command of the harmonica. Using a chromatic harp, a larger variant of 
the standard harmonica, he produced whirls of breath that could come out clean 
and sprightly like an accordion, thickly swirling like a Hammond B3 organ, or 
just crusty and tough, like a Chicago blues harp is supposed to sound. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was an engaging singer, favoring bright, conversational tones. His 
prolonged jams with the Bernie Pearl Band, which provided backup for three of 
the seven acts, featured frequent humorous byplay between Bell's chattering 
harmonica and Hollis Gilmore's sure, unflappable tenor saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
 With his weathered face and slumped shoulders, Bell, in his late 50s, looks a 
bit droopy. But on stage he was full of life, even if the audience wasn't as 
his set continued on past 1:30 a.m. to an ever sparser crowd.

DANCE REVIEWS; '90S TOKYO REFLECTED IN 'MASTERS' PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The elegant, accordion-pleated program read "Masters of Japanese Classical 
Dance," Friday at the Japan America Theatre. Officially designated Living 
National Treasure Jyuraku Hanayagi appeared, as did five grand masters from 
some of Japan's most distinguished music and dance schools. 
</P>
<P>
 However, much of the performance offered a radically updated classicism, one 
in which traditional styles of music alternated -- and sometimes clashed -- 
with harsh bursts of amplified metallic percussion, assaultive sound effects 
and pounding rhythms. Forget the calm beauty of Japan: This classicism 
reflected the extremes and energies of '90s Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a new reworking of the Kabuki classic "Narukami" featured a 
score by Yaoji Tokiwazu that juxtaposed long passages of choral singing, 
ear-splitting thunderclaps, clangorous gong-and-bell music and more familiar, 
plangent, aristocratic ensemble playing. Moreover, stark silence reigned in the 
key sequence when the tempted saint (the forceful Kikunojyo Onoe) succumbed to 
the beautiful princess (the graceful Mitsutae Takahamaryu) and, in this 
version, groped her joylessly. 
</P>
<P>
 A celebration of the Japanese fan, Sonokisuke Hanayagi's new male sextet 
"Senkei" featured steady, decorative movement gambits that seemed fundamentally 
disconnected from the propulsive sound score credited to Shin Miyashita 
(arrangement: Hiromitsu Nishikawa). Only at the end -- during a powerful 
buildup of percussive effects -- did music and dance grow in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1843 dance-drama "Kyo-Ningyo," Jyuraku Hanayagi played a master 
doll-maker whose creation (Rankei Fujima) came to life -- the same story as the 
1870 French ballet classic "Coppelia" using some of the same sight gags. 
Hanayagi emphasized sly bemusement in his artful portrayal, while Fujima 
doll-waddled deliciously in hers.

 M ail call. The envelope, please. . . .

<P>
 In regard to "People's Choice: Manson, Dahmer," I share your dismay that the 
networks are pandering to the prurient interests of a segment of the TV viewing 
audience. But I think you're being too hard on the public at large. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 The Manson show got 30% of the people tuning in, or about 35 million viewers 
(this according to Nielsen, whose dubious sampling method reminds me of the old 
joke about the drunk who has lost his wallet in a bar but is searching for it 
under a street lamp because the light is better there). 
</P>
<P>
 But even assuming the ratings are accurate (a big stretch), getting 30% of the 
viewers means that 70% were watching something else. That's about 82 million 
people. Add that to the other 133 million Americans who apparently weren't 
watching anything and you get about 215 million who never saw Charlie and his 
angels at all. That means only about 14% of the country's population did see 
the show. So what's all this hand- wringing about the public getting what they 
deserve for their depraved taste? 
</P>

 I can't express adequately my feelings of dismay and repulsion as the air time 
with Manson went on and on . I thought that, perhaps, they'd allow him a few 
seconds worth and spend more time with the victims' families or putting the 
crimes into topical perspective. I was counting on the Mansons taking 20 
minutes of the hour. Finally, I switched off in disgust. These people have 
nothing to say, and their presentation on TV can do no possible social good. So 
what was the point? 
</P>
<P>
 The point is exploiting the lowest and basest temptations of audiences for fun 
and profit, even at the risk of providing a negative inspiration in the figure 
of the notorious Manson to a whole new generation of disaffected youth. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if ABC News President Roone Arledge called Manson in prison and 
congratulated him: "Thanks, Charlie boy. You really pulled us out of that 10 
p.m. slump we've been having since we lost 'thirtysomething.' We're prepping 
for a sequel."

 A column you wrote touched upon my biggest problem with this 
news-as-high-tension-melodrama approach. It leaves a lot of people thinking 
that real life really is a nonstop roller coaster of shock, horror, outrage and 
violence. Polls have indicated that people who get their news from television 
tend to vastly overestimate the likelihood of themselves being the victim of a 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't been mugged in years, if at all, their car has never been stolen, 
they have never been raped and no one has ever attempted to murder them. But, 
when television tells them that the life they seem to be living is somehow 
abnormal, they decide that they are simply not perceiving their surroundings 
correctly. They begin to see evil lurking everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 When people assume that everybody around them is involved in some frightening 
melodrama and that they will be the victims, they do extraordinary things. The 
only time I ever had a gun fired at me was not in a robbery. It was when I was 
walking down a neighborhood street and some woman decided that by walking 200 
yards behind her I must be "following" her. She whipped out a pistol and fired 
several shots at me before racing off down the street screaming for help! The 
world is full of people who, taking their cue from melodramatic newscasts, 
expect everyone everywhere to be the enemy.

 Louis Farrakhan's appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show" further confirmed my 
belief that I don't need Howard Rosenberg to interpret or distort the view of a 
man who is quite capable of articulating his own positions. Upon closer 
examination, it is obvious that there is no problem of anti-Semitism involving 
Farrakhan, only a difference of political and theological viewpoint. We are 
maturing as a nation. God bless America! Wake up, Mr. Rosenberg!

 Whoopi Goldberg should not be confused about Louis Farrakhan's appearance on 
"The Arsenio Hall Show." After all, she not only had racist Ku Klux Klan leader 
Tom Metzger on her now-canceled show, but she sat with him and smiled while he 
insulted blacks and Jews.

 Yes, indeed, we all hail Sid Caesar and he deserves our praise. But so do the 
head writer, Mel Tolkin, and Lucille Kallen (who was one of two female writers 
during that era) deserve our praise. And let us not omit James Starbuck, the 
choreographer who contributed a body of work unmatched in TV.

STREET SMART: YORBA LINDA BLVD. STOP SIGNS INCONVENIENT, BUT BOON TO SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 This letter is to inquire about the new (August, 1993) stop signs on Yorba 
Linda Boulevard just before the Riverside Freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 I travel this road daily from Weir Canyon Road to California State University, 
Fullerton. I understood this rationale for placing some kind of traffic control 
along Yorba Linda Boulevard, due to cross traffic from the Riverside Freeway, 
but these two stop signs have added 15 minutes each way to my daily drive. 
Often there are evenings when traffic is backed from the signal at La Palma 
Avenue all the way to Santa Ana Canyon Road. This commute can often take more 
than the entire time it takes me to drive all the way to CSUF. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, the signal at Santa Ana Canyon and Weir Canyon roads in 25 out 
of 26 days will be red when approached from Weir Canyon going south, regardless 
of whether anyone is coming off the Riverside Freeway or coming from Yorba 
Linda Boulevard / Weir Canyon. Can this be explained? 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Evans Emery 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the ranks of several Street Smart readers who have also complained 
about the long delays created by those stop signs. Not to worry. Traffic 
signals are on the way.  
</P>
<P>
 The stop signs were erected last year as an interim safety measure by Caltrans 
with the agreement of Anaheim city officials, said Russ Maguire, deputy city 
engineer for Anaheim. Caltrans was in charge of the work because a freeway 
interchange was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly don't disagree that it has caused some inconvenience, but it has 
been a tremendous boon to safety," Maguire said. "The safety issues so 
outweighed any other issues that we concurred with Caltrans' idea to install 
the stop signs on an interim basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic signals should be installed in late May or early June of this year, 
Maguire said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the seemingly constant red traffic light on southbound Weir Canyon Road 
at Santa Ana Canyon Road, it's intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 At each intersection with a traffic light in Anaheim, one direction is 
designated "main phase," which means the the signal rests in green, and the 
other direction is designated for the signal to rest in red. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Canyon Road, which runs east and west, is on a main phase, which 
means the signal generally will be green, Jim Paral, principal traffic engineer 
of systems for Anaheim, said. Weir Canyon Road is the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 When a car traveling on Weir Canyon Road approaches the Santa Ana Canyon Road 
intersection, a sensor loop under the pavement will send a signal to the 
traffic light and it will turn green at an appropriate time allowing the 
vehicle to make its move, Paral said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Beginning next Monday, Orange County commuters will be able to choose from 
three daily commuter trains that will run between Oceanside and Los Angeles 
with stops in San Juan Capistrano, Irvine, Santa Ana, Orange, Anaheim and 
Fullerton. The trains will be part of the five-county Metrolink commuter train 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be three round trips each day in new, double-deck trains operated 
by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority. The last four days of March 
are a good time for potential train commuters to give Metrolink trains a 
firsthand look. Travel on all Orange County Metrolink trains will be free next 
Monday through March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Train riders can also take advantage of Orange County shuttle buses, which 
link every Orange County train station to major employment areas. Shuttle 
service is free to those who transfer to or from a Metrolink train.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the free-ride period ends, riders can buy train tickets from automated 
ticket machines at each station starting April 1. The machines accept cash, 
credit cards and ATM cards and dispense tickets for one-way and round-trip 
travel as well as monthly passes and 10-trip tickets, which allow a person to 
ride 10 times within a 90-day period.  
</P>
<P>
 Fares depend on the length of the trip and vary from $6 to $18 per round trip. 
For example, traveling between San Juan Capistrano and Los Angeles is $14 for a 
round-trip ticket, while the round trip between San Juan Capistrano and Santa 
Ana is $10. People 65 and over and people with disabilities ride for half 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding Metrolink is done on the honor system because tickets are not collected 
or stamped. Passengers are required to have their tickets in their possession 
while riding the train and must show them to a conductor if asked. Those 
failing to produce a ticket can be fined up to $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink operations began in Los Angeles and Ventura counties on Oct. 26, 
1992. The Orange County Metrolink line will be the fifth and longest corridor 
in the system, with service extending 87.3 miles between Oceanside and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>

 OCTA, Caltrans and the South Orange County Chambers of Commerce will host a 
community open house to provide information on the reconstruction of the El 
Toro Y interchange. The open house will be held from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Tuesday 
at the Hot Spring Dance Hall, 32506 Paseo Adelanto, San Juan Capistrano.  
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA / Caltrans Y Team will provide an overview of the 2 1/2-year 
construction project, which will improve one of the most congested interchanges 
in Orange County. The reconstruction is a $105-million project funded primarily 
by Measure M, the half-cent sales tax approved by Orange County voters in 1990 
to improve transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA officials will be on hand to answer questions and offer suggestions on 
how residents and businesses can manage during the project. A 12-minute video 
will also provide an overview.

DOCTOR IS WOUNDED IN AMBUSH AT HIS HOME; VIOLENCE: OBSTETRICIAN HAD JUST 
ARRIVED AT HOUSE AFTER DELIVERING A BABY AT CEDARS-SINAI. HIS FAMILY HAD MOVED 
TO NORTH HOLLYWOOD AFTER BEING DISPLACED BY THE QUAKE.

<P>
 Physician Paul Hackmeyer stayed up late to bring another baby into the world, 
only to be nearly robbed of his own life when he returned to his North 
Hollywood home early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer, a 41-year-old obstetrician, was returning from Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center when he was ambushed and shot in the chest shortly after midnight in 
what may have been an attempted robbery, Los Angeles police said. He was 
reported in stable condition after undergoing surgery at Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer had been at Cedars-Sinai delivering a baby boy, colleagues and 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pulled into his driveway and observed a couple of (men) in front of his 
residence," Sgt. John Stilo said. "He turned to go into his house and was shot 
several times." 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer may have been followed home from work, Stilo said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Hackmeyer's neighbors said: "I heard scuffling and then shots. Then I 
heard a lady screaming, 'Paul's been shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, she said, she went to her balcony and saw a car drive away, 
though she could not determine the make. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Galen, a family friend, said Hackmeyer was conscious after the surgery. 
"He was able to talk with his wife," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer, his wife -- attorney Nancy O. Hackmeyer -- and their three children 
had rented the North Hollywood home less than two months ago because their 
house in Sherman Oaks needed earthquake repairs, real estate agent Jane Kim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake devastated their home," said Kim, who found them the house on 
the 12600 block of Addison Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor said she had met Hackmeyer only last week, when she noticed that 
thieves had broken the window of his late-model Chrysler convertible, which was 
parked on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me he left his car on the street because he was a doctor and 
sometimes had to leave home fast," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues say Hackmeyer is a popular obstetrician and gynecologist on the 
staff of Cedars-Sinai. News of the shooting traveled quickly among the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is just horrified," said Virginia Siegfried, an obstetrician. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer, who completed medical school at New York Medical College, has 
worked at Cedars-Sinai since 1978, through his internship and residency. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanford Tisherman, a physician who shares an office with Hackmeyer, said he 
has rescheduled appointments with 50 to 60 patients, many of whom are pregnant 
women who "are beyond distraught at the news. Some of them can't even speak on 
the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Tisherman said Hackmeyer is known for his caring manner and clinical skills. 
"This is someone I would trust taking care of members of my own family.' 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors on Addison Street said they have had little trouble with crime in 
the past, which is in the Valley Village area of North Hollywood. Homes there 
typically sell for between $500,000 and $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects have been arrested and robbery detectives have been assigned to 
the case, police said.

WIFE FACES CHARGES OF HIRING ASSASSINS -- TWICE; COURTS: MARY ELLEN SAMUELS IS 
ACCUSED OF PAYING A HIT MAN TO KILL HER HUSBAND, THEN HIRING TWO MORE TO KILL 
THE GUNMAN. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAY SHE IS INNOCENT AND A VICTIM OF SPOUSAL 
ABUSE.

<P>
 To look at Mary Ellen Samuels, nothing would make you expect to find her where 
she will be this week -- in a courtroom, on trial in the murders of both her 
husband and the man she allegedly hired to shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Muffin," remarked a friend recently, waving at Samuels, 45, from the 
front row of a Van Nuys courtroom. "She's so darling," the friend added to 
another court watcher. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi, uses other choice words: 
greedy and manipulative and callous.  
</P>
<P>
 Samuels goes on trial this week in Van Nuys Superior Court; the charges 
include murder, attempted murder and soliciting murder. If the seven men and 
five women on her jury find Samuels guilty of deliberately killing her husband 
-- and then her hit man -- for financial gain, she could become the fifth woman 
among the 381 killers on California's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi is alleging that greed and a pending divorce motivated Samuels to hire 
a gunman to kill her husband of nine years, 40-year-old motion picture 
cameraman Robert B. Samuels, who had worked on the television series "China 
Beach" as well as the "Lethal Weapon" feature films and "Heaven Can Wait." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 8, 1988, he was ambushed inside the Sepulveda house the couple once 
shared, and shot in the head with a 16-gauge shotgun. There was no sign of a 
struggle. Mary Ellen and her 18-year-old daughter Nicole called the police, 
saying they had found his body in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The picture that I have of her is she was really pretty pampered by her 
husband," Maurizi said. "She was well taken care of. Her child was in private 
school. I think she already had what the average American would consider the 
good life. But half of it wasn't going to be good enough for her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About six months after Samuels' slaying, a botany professor on a nature hike 
found the body of the suspected hit man, a 27-year-old reputed cocaine dealer 
named James R. Bernstein, which had been dumped in remote Lockwood Canyon in 
Ventura County. Maurizi alleges that Samuels had to hire more hit men to do 
away with Bernstein when he asked for more money and threatened to go to the 
police if she did not pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys Philip Nameth and Justin M. (Josh) Groshan will tell the 
jury a different story. They contend that Bernstein, who carried a business 
card calling himself "James R. Bernstein, specialist," was smitten with the 
Samuelses' daughter. He acted on his own when he killed Robert Samuels, they 
say, after Nicole told him that Robert Samuels, her adoptive father, had 
molested her and raped her when she was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels is likely to testify, and her story of family abuse will 
play a key role in the defense case, Nameth said. As for who was involved in 
Bernstein's death and why, the defense attorneys say their list of people with 
strong motives is a long one that includes drug customers and suppliers -- but 
not Mary Ellen Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi said she does not believe that Samuels or her daughter were abused, 
adding that she has not found any medical or police reports to substantiate the 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The abuse defense angers Susan Conroy, Robert Samuels' sister. "It's the 
ultimate betrayal. He isn't here to defend himself. Bob was a hard-working guy 
and he loved them very much. He never would have done anything to them," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Edwin Gaul and Darell Ray Edwards, the men who admitted killing 
Bernstein, will testify under plea bargains that spared their lives but sent 
them to prison for 15 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other people Mary Ellen Samuels once considered her closest friends 
also will testify for the prosecution under grants of immunity to protect them 
from being charged after admitting their knowledge of the alleged plots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The defense maintains that Samuels is being sold out by a flock of 
"fair-weather friends" who implicated her to save themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Samuelses' marriage broke up in 1987 when Mary Ellen moved out, taking the 
refrigerator and leaving a five-page "Dear John" letter. She moved to a 
condominium in Reseda. For a while, according to court records, Robert Samuels 
expected them to reconcile. But reconciliation apparently was far from her 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 She said "that she hated him and that he abused her and her daughter and she 
wanted him done," longtime friend Heidi Dougall testified at a preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, Mary Ellen Samuels did not want to give up their 
investment -- a Subway sandwich franchise she managed on Van Nuys Boulevard in 
Sherman Oaks -- or the $1,600 she received in monthly support. 
</P>
<P>
 During the second half of 1988, Samuels spoke openly about having her husband 
killed, prosecutors say. She allegedly had to look no further than her friends 
and their lovers for her hit men. Even Nicole's high school friends were 
approached, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole, then a senior, turned to a friend in the cafeteria at Alemany High 
School and asked for help in finding a gun, Maurizi said. She said her mother 
had found someone to kill her father. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend, Celina Krall, recalled at an earlier hearing that Nicole "asked if 
I could get a gun so someone could take care of her father. She was tired of 
him beating her mother and raping them. She said she wanted to get rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Nameth called that scenario nonsensical. "Oh, come on. Be serious," he said. 
"What hit man doesn't carry his own gun?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Maurizi says Samuels did not seek out "the typical, Hollywood-style hit 
man."  
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels asked Celina's brother, John, and her fiance, David 
Navarro, if they would be interested in carrying out the hit, according to 
court records. She then continued to shop for a hit man and found one, 
prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
 About a month before Robert Samuels died, his wife arranged a dinner for him 
and several friends at a restaurant in Northridge. According to court records, 
the plan was to get him drunk and take his car, leaving him confused and 
vulnerable to the hit man who would stalk him in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the hit man never showed. Robert Samuels took a taxi home and Samuels 
complained bitterly to a friend that she and her hired hit men had "tried to do 
him" three or four times, Dougall testified at the preliminary hearing. "She 
said she'd spent almost $15,000 and nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Samuels allegedly became so frustrated that she took matters into her 
own hands, beating him with a broomstick, according to court records.  
</P>
<P>
 Other plots involved getting Robert Samuels drunk and driving him off a cliff 
along Mulholland Drive, Dougall said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the whole tale seems incredible, many of Mary Ellen Samuels' friends did 
not want to believe it, either. Hatched in some of the San Fernando Valley's 
better-known bars and restaurants, the murder plot seemed to be an open secret 
in some circles of the Valley's newly divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night always was rock 'n' roll night at the Tickets lounge at the 
Woodland Hills Marriott, where Marsha Hutchison met Mary Ellen Samuels in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone would talk about their divorces," complaining about being broke, she 
said. Hutchison was taken aback, however, when Samuels asked her for a loan to 
pay for a hit man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she just flipped out, had cracked up," Hutchison testified.  
</P>
<P>
 Just before Christmas, 1988, Hutchison testified, she received a call from 
Samuels. "She said something terrible had happened. Bob was dead. She said he 
had been shot in the head," Hutchison said.  
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, nobody wanted to talk about what had happened to Robert Samuels. 
And no one went to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels seemed to police to be very much the distraught spouse, and 
was not an immediate suspect. Her status in the investigation changed as 
Samuels collected about $500,000 worth of insurance and went on a shopping 
spree, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 She paid $50,000 in cash for a new white Porsche, bought a $130,000 condo in 
Cancun, Mexico, and was photographed lying on a bed -- wearing only a smile and 
about $20,000 in strategically placed stacks of $50 and $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Groover, a concert promoter who took the picture while vacationing with 
the recently widowed Mary Ellen Samuels in 1989, described it in court last 
week: "U.S. currency. Mary Ellen. A hotel bed, I believe in Cancun." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Michael Hoff has ruled that the prosecution can show the photograph to 
the jury, finding it relevant to the financial gain allegation. However, the 
judge ruled that the jury will not hear testimony about the personal license 
plate on her convertible: NAST VXN. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff consulted his desktop dictionary for that ruling. Nasty, he noted, means 
"very dirty or filthy, offensive, morally offensive, indecent, mean, malicious, 
ill-humored," while "vixen" is defined as "a female fox" or an "ill-tempered, 
shrewish woman."

IT'S TIME OF THE SEASON FOR HAY FEVER VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's hay fever season again. 
</P>
<P>
 But you hardly need to be reminded if you're among the estimated 20% of 
Americans with pollen allergies. That means eyeballs that itch, noses that run 
and stuffed-up heads that feel about ready to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 The symptoms probably showed up in the San Fernando Valley during the past 
couple of weeks, brought on by the recent spell of unusually warm and sometimes 
windy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, allergy experts say the pollen levels in the air are normal for this 
time of year. But it is still early and for many people the worst is yet to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, this year's sneezing season may turn out to be milder than last 
year's. The heavy winter rains last year made trees and plants grow like crazy. 
By comparison, this past winter was dry. 
</P>
<P>
 "As near as I can tell, it looks like a normal hay fever season," said Zeb 
Dyer, an allergy researcher at the Santa Barbara Medical Foundation Clinic. 
"But it all depends on the weather from here on out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rain would help wash some of these pollens out of the air," he said. "But if 
we have a lot of dry, windy days dispersing pollen all over the place, there 
are going to be a lot of sick people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some allergy sufferers are having a harder time of it this year because of the 
Northridge earthquake. Aftershocks from the Jan. 17 temblor continue to kick up 
lots of dust to irritate already sore noses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Donald L. Unger, an allergist who practices in Thousand Oaks, added that 
molds, growing in damp cracks of quake-damaged homes and offices, are also a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of my patients who are mold-sensitive are having a heck of a time," 
Unger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, pollinating trees are the biggest problem for most people, 
especially the Arizona cypress, coast live oak and olive. 
</P>
<P>
 But far more hay fever sufferers are allergic to pollen manufactured by 
grasses, such as false ragweed and other relatives of the best-known hay fever 
producer, Bermuda grass, Timothy grass and fescue. 
</P>
<P>
 And grasses won't begin pollinating in earnest for another couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, "people with asthma will also be having more symptoms," said Dr. 
Wayne E. Imber, an Encino allergist. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other allergy experts say the best thing a sufferer can do is identify 
the source of the problem and try to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other survival tips: Stay indoors if possible during the early morning and 
afternoon hours, when pollen levels are highest. If you have to go outside at 
those times, change clothes when you get home and wash your hair to get rid of 
pollen. Use an air conditioner indoors with a good filter. Imber said many hay 
fever sufferers can get through the season with non-prescription remedies, such 
as eyedrops, antihistamines and nasal sprays. 
</P>
<P>
 If those don't work, other allergists recommend several relatively new 
prescription antihistamines that are non-sedating, including Seldane, Hismanal 
and Claritin. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are new prescription steroid nasal sprays that work well without 
the serious side effects of other medicines containing steroids. 
</P>
<P>
 If all else fails, allergy shots are probably the answer. The shots, initially 
once a week then with decreasing frequency for at least six months, almost 
always work. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the literature, they're 90% effective," Imber said. Springtime

POLICE STILL SEARCHING FOR COMPUTER THIEVES; CRIME: AUTHORITIES SAY A BOTCHED 
ROBBERY IN RESEDA IN WHICH TWO MEN ARE SHOT IS THE FIRST VALLEY INCIDENT IN A 
SERIES OF SUCH CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police Sunday were still looking for armed intruders who have been shopping 
for victims through ads in the Recycler, a weekly advertiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men shot Saturday were the latest victims -- but the first in the San 
Fernando Valley -- of robbers who pretend to be interested in buying Macintosh 
computers from Recycler classified ads, but instead steal them by force. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves have struck in the Westside eight times since December. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley case, one man was shot in the leg and another shot twice in the 
chest by a man in his early 20s who had knocked on the door to ask about a 
computer advertised for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the house in the 18400 block of Keswick Street, the robber pulled 
a handgun and bound both men with rope, Los Angeles police said. One of the 
victims managed to free himself and went to get his own gun. He and his 
companion were shot during a gun battle with the robber. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said their injuries were not life threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer, which police believe the intruder intended to steal, was not 
taken, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Recycler robberies were in West Los Angeles, Culver City and Santa 
Monica, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Recycler last week called 100 advertisers in the Los 
Angeles and South Bay areas to warn them about the robberies. They advised 
advertisers to meet with buyers during the day and in a public place whenever 
possible, said Paul Schultz, the paper's director of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the suspects had been using a beeper, advertisers were also warned to 
verify that the buyer had a home phone number. The suspects had been using the 
name Mike or Michael, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can't even do business from their own homes," said a neighbor of the 
Reseda victims.

EARLY MORNING FIRE DESTROYS GLENDALE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire gutted a three-story home early Sunday after an explosion that may have 
ignited the blaze, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 firefighters battled the 12:30 a.m. blaze in the 2800 block of 
Kennington Drive and brought it under control within one hour, but cleanup 
efforts at the scene continued until about 7 a.m., said Mike Hand, a fire 
dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the home was a total loss, and estimated the structure's 
loss at $500,000. The loss to contents in the home was estimated at $50,000, 
Hand said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the blaze is under investigation, Hand said.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: 5TH-GRADE JOURNALISTS REPORT QUAKE NEWS CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the most poignant, firsthand reporting of the Northridge earthquake 
came from a handful of young journalists who put out something called the 
Calahan Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Calahan School fifth-graders worked with fervor and diligence to get out their 
special earthquake edition -- which they reported and edited in two weeks, 
instead of the six weeks it usually takes to produce their newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 800 copies of the 12-page paper go out to all school families and many in 
the school's Northridge neighborhood, as well as to other schools and school 
administrators in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And this particular issue went to other cities, to the many people who had 
lent aid and support after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Calahan School was near the epicenter, an area of heavy damage. Help came to 
the school and its families from all over, including bags of clothing sent from 
students at Bancroft Elementary School in Spring Valley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Calahan Principal Rick Wetzell, the paper is a good learning 
experience for the students, as well as an excellent way to reach out to the 
community and tell the school's neighbors what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper's adviser is Cheryl Crooks, a free-lance journalist whose byline has 
appeared in Time, Parents and American Health magazines. Crooks, whose two sons 
attend Calahan, comes into the classroom every Friday morning to work with 
fifth-graders on the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 She and the young staff begin the process of putting out each issue with a 
story conference, the way they do at big-league national publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discuss what subjects are of interest in the school and in the community, 
and then students request the stories they would like to do," Crooks says. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are then responsible for following up on the interviewing and 
reporting. "Their level of responsibility, competence and enthusiasm often 
surprises me," Crooks says of the 9- and 10-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Crooks began the program two years ago in what has been a strictly volunteer 
effort, with the support of fifth-grade teacher Marianne Brooker. 
</P>
<P>
 Crooks has taught her young reporters such concepts as the inverted-pyramid 
style of news writing and how to craft a proper lead. The students punch their 
stories into one of the paper's three computers, and Crooks edits them and lays 
out the paper on her home computer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the earthquake edition there was a front-page story, by Christine Lu and 
Kristen Rodner, about the personal experiences of Calahan students, many of 
whom were left homeless by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Calahan kindergartner Jasmin Horton, who lived in the Northridge Meadows 
apartment complex, tells how she hid under the coffee table when the shaking 
started, while her dad kicked the apartment door open so the family could get 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 First-grader Sheer Laskier and third-grader Ron Laskier tell about escaping 
their collapsing apartment by jumping out a window, and fourth-grader Antuane 
Rosas says her family got out of their apartment by "stepping over our stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Kesiha Hawkins, a fourth-grader, tells how her apartment was condemned and she 
is now living with a relative, and Terra Marie Weigold, a fourth-grader, tells 
how her mom had to unscrew a door to get her dog out. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the first page is a story by Tamara Matinata, which tells how 
topsy-turvy things were once Calahan School was able to reopen Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside stories tell about how the earthquake affected local businesses and how 
some Cal State Northridge students are attending class at Calahan because their 
classrooms are condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 One enterprising student, Eric Hodgkins, did a phone interview with Eric 
Riggs, a California Institute of Technology data analyst of seismic activity. 
His story included a two-page printout of what the quake looked like on a 
seismograph, courtesy of Cal Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgkins' first question was, "why can't we see earthquakes coming?" 
</P>
<P>
 Something we would all like to know. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was that they are undetectable because they are an underground 
phenomenon, something the Calahan Chronicle definitely is not. Happy Mother's 
Day -- and Eat My Dust

 Mother's Day is May 8 and it's not a moment too early to let the family know

at Palmdale's Los Angeles County Raceway, where you can wheel around in a 
$50,000 dragster capable of doing a quarter-mile in nine seconds flat? 
</P>
<P>
 If that's a bit pricey, you can take the family vehicle out to the raceway any 
weekend and for $20 floor that sucker all day long to your heart's content.

 "We get a lot of frustrated motorists out here for both the school and 
raceway," says Donna Tite.

Bernie Longjohn, "and it's cheaper than therapy." Overheard:

2 ORCHESTRAS SQUABBLE OVER PLAZA SCHEDULING; THOUSAND OAKS: THE SYMPHONIES 
BICKER OVER WHICH SHOULD COME FIRST AT THE NEW PERFORMING ARTS CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When first confronted with a noisy dispute between Ventura County's two 
symphony orchestras, Larry Janss labeled it "a clash of titans." 
</P>
<P>
 But half an hour of bickering later, Janss revised his metaphor, telling the 
symphony directors that their rivalry resembled "a lot of monkeys" mixing it up 
"in a small cage." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the analogy, the relationship between Thousand Oaks' Conejo Symphony 
and the Oxnard-based Ventura County Symphony has hit a sour note. And Janss -- 
a member of Thousand Oaks' theater commission -- will likely listen to a lot 
more dissonance this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of the City Council, the theater commission Wednesday will 
revisit the issue of when to schedule orchestral performances in the new Civic 
Arts Plaza's 1,800-seat auditorium, which opens in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the Conejo Symphony, Everett Ascher, has complained long and 
loud that the schedule as written gives an unfair boost to the out-of-town 
Ventura County Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has stripped away any lingering stereotypes of classical musicians 
as refined, sophisticated folk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, people who are very artistic in nature tend to get more emotional 
and more excited about issues," said Karine Beesley, executive director of the 
Ventura County Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuckling, theater veteran Tom Mitze added: "It's not genteel." 
</P>
<P>
 But as executive director of the Civic Arts Plaza auditorium, Mitze said he 
recognizes that "the issue of scheduling never goes away." 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, the case of the dueling symphonies is coming back again at 
Wednesday night's meeting -- a full month after theater commissioners thought 
that they had resolved the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by Councilman Frank Schillo, Ascher plans to plead for revisions in the 
opening week schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 His primary concern: Although his Conejo Symphony will preside over the 
performing arts center's grand opening, the rival Ventura County Symphony will 
launch its regular season of classical music with a splashy performance during 
the auditorium's first full week of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard-based group plans a "symphony orchestra blowout, with quadruple 
woodwinds and brass" and up to 100 musicians, Beesley said. The symphony may 
also weave some of its funky trademarks into the show by flashing colored 
spotlights on the musicians or displaying slides on an oversized screen behind 
the orchestra pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three days after its rival's sound-and-light extravaganza, the Conejo 
Symphony will kick off its own subscription series with a concert featuring 
renowned pianist Victor Borge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Symphony has snagged better dates -- the concerts with Borge are 
scheduled Saturday night and Sunday afternoon, whereas the Ventura County 
Symphony will perform on a Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mere fact that the Ventura County Symphony comes first in the schedule 
seemed a snub to Ascher and his Conejo Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo agreed, telling the council last week that the schedule disturbed him. 
Reluctant to step into a cultural war, the other council members decided to 
refer the matter to the seven-member theater commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would much rather this be handled by the Civic Theaters Commission," Mayor 
Elois Zeanah said. She added, however: "One of the reasons I'm excited about 
the new auditorium is that it will give the Conejo Symphony a place to perform. 
I certainly consider them our resident orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have always promised to give local groups priority in using the 
Civic Arts Plaza. Although they hope that the auditorium will gain fame as a 
regional cultural center, they also want it to serve as a showcase for 
home-grown talent. 
</P>
<P>
 By most reckonings, the Conejo Symphony qualifies as local. For 33 years, the 
orchestra has performed at a local school gym, wooing audiences despite the 
hard metal seats and occasional plink-plink of rain hitting the tin roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians, like the listeners, have proved loyal. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling professionals, they perform throughout Southern California. They 
play in many venues more glamorous than the California Lutheran University gym, 
but they return to Thousand Oaks season after season. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 75 to 90 musicians featured in each concert, most consider themselves 
Conejo Symphony veterans, Ascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these Thousand Oaks die-hards want to be the first to test Civic Arts 
Plaza's vaunted acoustics with a full-scale classical concert. Their director 
believes that it's their due, especially because the Conejo Symphony 
contributed nearly $400,000 to the Civic Arts Plaza fund-raising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the commitment of our orchestra, board of directors and symphony guild 
to the city, it's only right and fitting that we should open the regular season 
subscription series," Ascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ascher said he has "no particular problem" with the Ventura County Symphony 
performing on Conejo Symphony turf. They can play in the Civic Arts Plaza any 
time they want, he said, "but we just don't think they should have the 
privilege of opening the season subscription series." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Beesley professes amazement at the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand what's such a big deal here," she said. "We wanted to be 
part of opening week, and it would be foolish of us not to take advantage (of a 
free night). We think we have an orchestra that deserves to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Both symphonies have thrived for three decades in the county, with overlapping 
but largely distinct audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County orchestra draws most of its 1,100 season-ticket holders 
from west of the Conejo Grade, and the Thousand Oaks group reaches more than 
800 subscribers in the eastern valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestras also perform different types of music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Symphony usually sticks to familiar classical music, famous guest 
stars and scattered pop performances. "We don't perform the stuff of poets and 
prize committees, because that would drive our audience out of the house," 
Ascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Symphony, on the other hand, aims for more off-beat, 
experimental productions. Next year's season, for example, will feature a 
semi-staged opera and a musical interpretation of Shakespeare's "Midsummer 
Night's Dream" backed by a women's choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the distinct styles, the symphony directors worry that for some 
audiences, classical music is classical music. And too much classical music 
could turn potential patrons away from the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Symphony will perform three concerts there in the 1994-95 
season, and the Conejo Symphony will present seven shows plus the grand 
opening. Eventually, Beesley hopes to bring a full six-concert Ventura County 
Symphony series to the Thousand Oaks auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could easily happen that because of scheduling conflicts, both symphonies 
could end up bleeding to death," Ascher told the theater commission last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners declined to comment on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo eagerly jumped into the fray last week, telling the council that 
the schedule disturbed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may sound like a small thing, but (opening week) is a onetime event," he 
said. "I think there's something wrong when we have another symphony open the 
season at our Civic Arts Plaza, no matter how good they might be." Symphony 
Season 
</P>
<P>
 Season tickets to the Conejo Symphony's inaugural season in the Civic Arts 
Plaza will range in cost from $66.50 to $266 for seven performances. Ticket 
prices for individual concerts have not yet been determined. Here is the 
tentative program schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 29 and 30: Orchestral concert with pianist Victor Borge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 10: Performance with baritone Sylvester Blue and the Sherwood Singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 14: Concert featuring pianist Daniel Pollack playing Beethoven's Concerto 
No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 11: Program featuring the music of American composer Gordon Getty. 
</P>
<P>
 March 11: Concert featuring violinist Glenn Dicterow, concert master and 
soloist for the New York Philharmonic, playing Brahms violin concertos. 
</P>
<P>
 April 22, 1995: Concert with pianist Vladimir Feltsman. 
</P>
<P>
 May 30, 1995: Pops program featuring Shirley Jones, actress and singer who 
appeared in movies "Oklahoma!" and "Carousel."

COUNTY SUPERVISORS AND ECOLOGICAL SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Much of your Feb. 20 op-ed piece by Sandy Wohlgemuth about significant 
ecological areas consists of opinions based on inaccuracies and distortions of 
the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Wohlgemuth states that the board majority of county supervisors -- Deane 
Dana, Pete Schabarum and myself -- were opposed to the SEA concept. As a matter 
of fact, the board -- on my motion -- has twice adopted general plan updates, 
one for the Santa Clarita Valley in 1984 and the other for the Antelope Valley 
in 1986, in which we affirmed our commitment to SEAs. This was in the face of 
opposition from affected landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 He fails to mention that the lawsuit leading to the development of the SEA 
concept was filed against the previous "liberal" board made up of Supervisors 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, Ed Edelman, Kenneth Hahn and Baxter Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 He then adds (incorrectly) that the county has allowed these resource areas to 
deteriorate. Of course, he offers no examples. Nor does he acknowledge that 
over half of the identified 61 SEAs are outside the county's control and under 
the control of one or more of its cities, which are not obligated under state 
law to respect any of these SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
 We have done a great deal, within our limited resources, to enhance these 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan has never prohibited development within SEAs. Most do not 
require public ownership (assuming we could afford to buy them). They can 
coexist with sensitively designed developments. In most cases, the county has 
required developers to "cluster" developments on the property, leaving the 
sensitive areas as permanent open space. Acreage has also been purchased, using 
park bonds, to protect certain of the sensitive areas both in Santa Clarita and 
the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one case in which Mr. Wohlgemuth has cause to complain, about which 
he is strangely silent. That case involves the board's approval of the 
expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill last year. That action, which I 
opposed, permitted the conversion of about one square mile of SEA lands (and 
the cutting of about 3,000 oak trees) to permit the expansion of a dump. I 
fought that action, but was overruled by the current "liberal" board. 
Supervisor Edelman (one of Wohlgemuth's white knights) made the motion to 
approve this destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Wohlgemuth closes by stating that the courts may be the final authority on 
this issue, and he cites the Westridge case in the Santa Clarita Valley as an 
example. He incorrectly states that the judge in that case did not rule on the 
SEA issue, ignoring the fact that the attorneys for the plaintiffs somehow 
missed the appeal date, as if they were bumbling neophytes unschooled in 
judicial procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Mr. Wohlgemuth has a political (as opposed to an environmental) 
agenda far removed from the protection of ecological resources. He tries to 
condemn "conservatives" (without justification) while ignoring the real 
failures of the "liberals" (who are the ones willing to surrender these 
resources to other uses like landfills).

 * My adorable poodle "Cream Puff" was taken out of my yard by a coyote in 
February, 1993.My yard is fenced, but the coyote still got in.

 I put signs out after the incident to warn others with small animals and

THE BOTTOM LINE AND EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * What is Cal State Northridge teaching its students by planning to pay a 
$15,000 fee to a visiting poet (Valley Newswatch, March 10) while the 
classrooms in the portable trailers lack basic necessities, such as chalk, 
boards and trash cans? Are they supposed to feel better about substandard 
teaching conditions by listening to the "pricey poet . . . read some of her 
works?" 
</P>
<P>
 It seems irresponsible to keep telling the students that the university's 
budget is strained to the limit, and then to turn around and incur an expense 
that is clearly a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the value of "living within one's means" worth teaching any more?

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Our dog was found seven weeks after the Jan. 17 earthquake, roaming the 
hills of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Her safe return occurred only because of numerous caring people and their 
special efforts, and the family would like to express our appreciation: 
</P>
<P>
 * To the couple who spotted her living on the San Diego/Ventura Freeway 
interchange and scoured the neighborhood for a flyer, alerting us. 
</P>
<P>
 * To freeway motorists who assisted us in our (unsuccessful) Feb. 19 pursuit, 
donating a rope and even dog food. 
</P>
<P>
 * To the animal shelter volunteers, rescue groups and many kind individuals 
who responded to ads by phoning advice and encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 * To Westward Ho, Thrifty Drug and other merchants whose posted flyers 
effected her return. 
</P>
<P>
 * And most especially to the family who insured her survival by providing food 
-- three times a day for two weeks for one large, skinny, frightened great Dane 
mix named Boogie. And had she ever "boogied!"

SUPPORTERS OF STADIUM TO BEGIN FUND RAISING; SCHOOLS: HIGHLAND HIGH HOPES TO 
GENERATE AS MUCH AS $1 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A 6,000- SEAT ATHLETIC 
FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The goal is to raise as much as $1 million for a stadium. The method will 
include everything from collecting loose change to seeking $5,000 donations 
from local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of an ambitious plan by staff, parents and supporters of 
Highland High School who are preparing to kick off a fund-raising drive to 
build a 6,000-seat stadium at their school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want it to be something beautiful for the whole community," said 
Barbra Johnson, vice principal-athletic director at Highland High. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school and its eastside sister campus, Littlerock High School, opened 
in the fall of 1991, each with a football field but without bleachers, ticket 
booths, concession stands, or even bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not sufficient monies remaining after the schools were designed to 
meet the academic requirements to fund an entire stadium," said Con Oamek, 
Antelope Valley Union High School District assistant superintendent of business 
services. "There were sufficient funds to build a football field at the stadium 
location." 
</P>
<P>
 While the fields, which cost more than $30 million each, allow members of the 
football, soccer and track teams to practice, games have to be played at other 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And that can get expensive. Playing games at Antelope Valley College cost the 
high school as much as $1,500 per game in fees, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a stadium," Johnson said. "We need to generate the school spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas being pursued to raise money include promoting a concert, a community 
candy drive and placing large water bottles around campus for students to 
contribute their spare change. 
</P>
<P>
 "When kids had a penny or a dime or a nickel they could put it in there," she 
said. "Every penny counts." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee may also sell spots on a plaque that would be at the stadium, 
Johnson said. Donors of $200 could have their names, or that of someone else, 
preserved for posterity. A car raffle, golf tournament and fund-raisers at 
local restaurants are also being considered to help the school reach its goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland High Principal Jay Clark said the school may receive some money as a 
result of the district's recent agreement with the Palmdale Redevelopment 
Agency. It is estimated that the agreement will provide the school district 
with about $30 million over the next 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely, he said, that the stadium will be built as funds are raised. The 
bleachers would be first, then maybe the lights and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just really in the infant stages right now," Clark said. "We know it's 
going to take awhile to do this. It's not going to happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson estimated that it would take two years to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
 She said, "Sometimes I wish I could go house to house and say, 'Do you have a 
dollar?' "

EASTERN EUROPEANS ARE NEW REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ahmet Hadzimujagic and his wife, Aida, 
led a charmed existence. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a successful architect. She was a doctor. They owned a bed and 
breakfast in Srebrenica, then a popular resort town famous for its mineral 
springs. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, the Hadzimujagics (pronounced Ha-jee-moo-jah-jick) and their two 
young daughters, Selma and Jasmine, are penniless refugees living in this small 
city thousands of miles from home -- their sole means of survival a $730 
welfare check and $191 worth of food stamps. They arrived in Orange County two 
months ago from a refugee camp in Split, Croatia. "Step by step, we are getting 
used to life here," said Aida Hadzimujagic, 36, during an interview at the 
county welfare office in Anaheim. "But the biggest problem is money. What we 
get from welfare is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hadzimujagics are among a small but growing number of Eastern Europeans in 
Southern California who came to the United States as political refugees and now 
depend entirely on public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1989, there were just 289 cases of former Eastern Europeans and 
Soviet citizens on a variety of welfare programs in Orange County. In January, 
1994, there were 738 cases. In many instances, each case represents three 
people, and sometimes more. 
</P>
<P>
 According to social services officials, the increasing visibility of Eastern 
Europeans and citizens of the former Soviet Union on local welfare rolls -- 
there were virtually none 10 years ago -- is one barometer of a shift in U.S. 
immigration policy. With the normalization of relations between the U.S. and 
Vietnam, immigration slots that once were automatically reserved for Southeast 
Asians are now gradually being redistributed among Eastern Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 One result of the new immigration quotas has been an unprecedented flow of 
Russians, Romanians, Armenians, Poles and others into county welfare offices, 
according to social services officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Eastern Europeans still make up just 1% of the 40,000 Orange County 
families receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children payments, social 
services officials say they are monitoring the numbers closely in an effort to 
prepare for the possible impact on future caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the coming years, we're going to be seeing different groups than what 
we've been seeing over the past 15 years," said Angelo Doti, director of 
financial assistance for the Orange County Social Services Agency. "We're 
trying to plan ahead and think about things like our language capability and 
staff recruitment." 
</P>
<P>
 Social worker Darek Gartska, a Polish native who was himself a refugee four 
years ago, has been called upon numerous times to act as an interpreter in 
Russian, Polish and Czech. Gartska's Eastern European clients run the gamut: 
Ukrainians, Armenians, Lithuanians, Bosnians and Russians, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Ahmet Hadzimujagic, some of Gartska's clients are highly skilled 
professionals. But because they can communicate only in their native languages, 
he said, their chances of finding work here are virtually nil. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with children can collect AFDC until their children turn 18. Single 
people and couples without children are eligible for the federal government's 
Refugee Cash Assistance program, which contributes a small amount toward their 
living costs for a maximum of eight months. Refugees are also eligible for 
MediCal. 
</P>
<P>
 They include people like Oleg Pinkevich, a 21-year-old from the former Soviet 
Union, who says he left his native country last September to avoid serving in 
the army. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid because they can send you to strange places far away from home 
like Afghanistan," Pinkevich said through a Russian interpreter. He also said 
he feared that he would be mistreated in the army because he is a Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkevich said he left his mother, father, brother and sister behind five 
months ago to come to live with an uncle in Brea. He attends a technical school 
and, because he is unemployed, receives $299 a month from the Refugee Cash 
Assistance program plus $102 in food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 According to immigration officials, more than half of the 120,000 people 
admitted to the United States as political refugees this year will come from 
Eastern European countries -- mainly the nations of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 will gravitate to California, most because they already have 
family, friends and business contacts here. Although most will settle in Los 
Angeles, Orange County and San Francisco will also be popular destinations, 
said Bruce Kennedy, chief of the state Department of Social Services' refugee 
and immigration bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "The largest percentage -- primarily Soviet Jews -- will go to New York. But 
the second largest number will come to California," Kennedy said. "They tend to 
go where the previous settlement patterns have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Many times, however, the relatives who promised to help them get on their feet 
renege when they actually arrive. Many, Gartska says, are left in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very common where the relative says, 'I'm sorry, I can't help you," 
Gartska said. "When people come over, it's not an easy job. They have 
transportation problems, they need to find schools. A lot of the times they 
can't speak English." 
</P>
<P>
 Other refugees end up in Orange County because several international 
sponsorship agencies have branches here. The agencies process the necessary 
immigration forms but often do little to help the new refugees find work once 
they get here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some volunteer agencies abhor anyone coming here to be a public charge 
whereas others almost encourage it," Doti said. "Plus, a lot of the people from 
communist countries view government differently. They view public assistance as 
a right." 
</P>
<P>
 But some are ashamed to be on public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to work," said Alma Ibrahimovic, a 35-year-old urban planner from 
Sarajevo who now lives in Yorba Linda with a Muslim family that sponsors her. 
"I have applied for 18 positions, but unfortunately, almost every day, I 
receive a letter that says I'm not accepted."

WAVE OF HOPEFULS VIE TO BE LIFEGUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another crop of heroes was being harvested at the Newport Pier early Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was required of the 55 hopefuls competing for summer lifeguard jobs 
with the city was the ability to swim like a fish, run like a deer and be as 
gracious as a church usher. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about half of the job-seekers will make it to the payroll. Although it's 
a summer job, most who make the grade come back year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to quit once you start," said Brent Jacobsen, 26, who will only 
walk away from his job as a lifeguard if he learns he has passed the state bar 
exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Irwin, 76, has yet to walk away entirely. He knows the attraction of the 
sand and surf.  
</P>
<P>
 Irwin was pressed into duty as a 14-year-old bystander in 1932 when the bodies 
of five youngsters had to be retrieved near the mouth of the Santa Ana River. 
He became a full-time employee the next day and retired from lifeguard duties 
in his late 60s. But Irwin still volunteers at the annual tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all I've done all my life -- ocean work and swimming," the wiry Irwin 
said as he waited for the race to begin. Irwin also coached high school and 
college sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the lifeguards are college or even high school students who return to 
their jobs every year between semesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets them through college," Marine Safety Department Lt. Jim Turner said. 
"You get them four to six years. You really get them at a neat time in their 
lives. You get them as 16-year-olds and (when they leave the job) they are 
adults." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 of the 55 lean, young men and women will be selected to work during 
the summer months at $10.95 an hour. The swimming and running tests are only 
the beginning. Applicants must also pass a written test and medical evaluation. 
Lifeguards also must show poise or, as one veteran described it, "good public 
relations" when dealing with the people they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good summer job," panted a breathless Jason Klick, 19, the first 
applicant to emerge from the churning surf after completing an 800-yard swim in 
just over 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifeguards all work for the Newport Beach Marine Safety Department, which 
increases from 10 year-round employees to about 150 lifeguards during the warm 
summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the allure of a day in the sun at the beach, this is deadly serious 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer hundreds of lives will be saved by the men and women who 
gathered Sunday on the sand beneath the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Belshe, 59, retired as a lifeguard in 1987, but like Irwin he too still 
shows up to help at tryouts. In all his years as a lifeguard, Belshe never got 
to a swimmer in distress too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had unconscious victims, but I have gotten them to come around," Belshe 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good feeling to save people," Belshe said. "A lot of times you don't 
get a 'thank you' because they may be embarrassed. But a lot of times you do. 
It's pretty rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the work is not for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes dedication -- the ability to sit in that tower at all times and 
still be alert," Irwin said. "When that surf comes up and that tide comes in, 
some of these guys will make 18 to 20 rescues a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "But maybe tomorrow there will be nothing out there, and they still have to be 
alert."

SHOOK UP, BUT STILL STANDING; TEMBLOR: AFTERSHOCK JOLTS VALLEY RESIDENTS' 
ALREADY FRAYED NERVES. TROUBLE SPOTS INCLUDE A QUAKE-DAMAGED SHERMAN OAKS HOUSE 
THAT SLIDES ANOTHER 30 FEET OFF ITS FOUNDATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Sunday's 5.3 aftershock to the Northridge earthquake rattled San Fernando 
Valley residents' already-frayed nerves, but caused few problems at spots that 
were the hardest hit by the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 One exception was in Sherman Oaks, where the aftershock sent a house at 3623 
Dixie Canyon Ave. that slipped off its foundation in January tumbling another 
30 feet down the hill. Residents of two homes below the house on Inwood Street 
had to be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitness Luis Ortiz, who was polishing a car on Inwood Street when the slide 
began, said, "I saw the whole house coming down. I thought it was going to hit 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 But elsewhere in the Valley, the freeways held up, as did the Northridge 
Meadows apartment complex on Reseda Boulevard, where 16 people died in the 
January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 No freeways in the Los Angeles area were closed due to the earthquake, said 
Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few freeways near the epicenter sustained minor damage, by Sunday 
afternoon Caltrans crews had cleared away the debris and shored up the damaged 
stretches. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Golden State Freeway near Balboa Boulevard, Caltrans crews replaced 
temporary asphalt patches made after the Jan. 17 quake that came loose during 
the aftershock. Other patches were also replaced at the interchange of the Simi 
Valley and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials had worried that the powerful aftershock would cause 
further damage to a portion of the San Diego Freeway near Rinaldi Street in 
Mission Hills that had been elevated on temporary support beams for repairs. 
But the support beams held fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiritilli said Caltrans crews will continue Monday to inspect freeways 
throughout Los Angeles. "It's an ongoing process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The street in front of the Northridge Meadows complex was crowded with gawkers 
when Sunday's aftershock rumbled through, as it has been nearly every weekend 
since the three-story building collapsed. But no one seemed upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was incredible," said Jamie DeMatoff, who sells souvenir quake T-shirts in 
a mall parking lot next to the crumbled complex. "Traffic came to a halt. All 
these cars were bouncing, and about 25 people came running out of the Mongolian 
Bar-B-Q (restaurant)." 
</P>
<P>
 "There were all these looky-loo tourists and they came out scared," he said. 
"They were saying, 'Was that the real big one?' and I was saying, 'No, that's 
not the big one. You'll know when the big one hits.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the intersection of Balboa Boulevard and Rinaldi Street, water flowed from 
a broken hydrant, but it was a burble compared to the gusher of water and fire 
that spouted Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Hollywood, Karen Back, a free-lance writer, said her home was not hit 
nearly as hard as in January but "different things happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Back said in the January quake, "we lost our chimney, most of our china and 
dishes and had a computer that was severely damaged. We were cleaning up for a 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, several household items that withstood the previous quake fell, 
including a couple of clocks and a perfume bottle that was an anniversary gift 
from her husband, John. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This shake was so different from the other aftershocks," Back said. "I can't 
believe they're calling this an aftershock, it felt so much like the Jan. 17 
quake. Enough already." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if that meant she was ready to leave Los Angeles, Back said: "I've been 
thinking about it because of the economic situation as well as the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (Sunday's aftershock) puts another notch in the belt."  
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, what is left of the former Dixie Avenue house perched 
precariously on the hillside was to be removed early today, said Frank Bush, an 
inspector for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The house had already been scheduled for demolition before Sunday's quake, 
Bush said. It is owned by Mary Bond, 85, who lived there 40 years before Jan. 
17, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, "We've found many new cracks, but nothing major yet," 
said engineer Chris Brock of Law/Crandall Inc., following Sunday's aftershock. 
The firm has been involved in work resulting from widespread damage to the 
university by the January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock forced Sherman Oaks Fashion Square to close because of minor 
damage, including broken floor tiles and glass near the escalators, said Juan 
Baello, a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Square had just reopened Saturday for the first time since the Jan. 17 
quake. Relatively few shoppers were in the mall when the aftershock hit because 
only 34 of its stores had finished cleaning up from the Northridge quake. 
Fashion Square planned to reopen again Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Galleria, which was also forced to close temporarily by the 
Northridge quake, remained open Sunday, although about half of the 80 stores 
were closed by shop owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Engineers were checking and there were no problems," said mall spokeswoman 
Pam Evertz. 
</P>
<P>
 But several shops in the Glendale Galleria closed. "It shook us pretty hard," 
said Drew Boghorsyan, of the mall's customer services department. "We heard the 
building just rumble. It was really scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Boghorsyan said 26 of the 248 stores in the mall closed after the quake 
because merchants wanted to go home. He knew of no damage to stores that 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge Fashion Center, where the January quake delivered some of 
its worst damage, 23 workers still working to clean up that mess so the mall 
can reopen were on hand for Sunday's shaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the center of the mall when it hit," said supervisor Al Flores of 
the Cleveland Wrecking Co. "It was a lot of bumping up and down. We just got 
all our people together, made sure everyone was all right, and got out of 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 A new shift of workers went in the Fashion Center about 2:30 on Sunday, and 
work resumed inside the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacoima, Lt. Joe Hiltner, night watch commander at the Foothill police 
station, said the building suffered some broken pipes and cracks. Some existing 
cracks got bigger, and ceiling tiles fell. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sylmar, the aftershock knocked objects off shelves and caused residents to 
flee into the streets. Electricity was out for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dozen quake-jittery people lined up at a Vons supermarket to buy 
bottled water, although one resident said there was no official notice that tap 
water was bad. In the city of San Fernando, another Vons store on San Fernando 
Mission Boulevard closed for two hours after the temblor caused merchandise to 
fall off the shelves. The store's manager said no one was hurt.

FOR OXNARD'S TOM HOLDEN, 'CHANGE' IS STILL THE WATCHWORD; POLITICS: COUNCILMAN 
BELIEVES THAT THE CITY SHOULD BE RUN LIKE A BUSINESS. EFFICIENCY, PRIVATIZATION 
ARE AT THE TOP OF HIS AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tom Holden was preaching to the converted. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's newest councilman returned last week to the neighborhood of his 
youth, a middle-class community like many in the city that are fighting hard to 
loosen the grip of gangs and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 He told members of the Fremont neighborhood patrol how they have come to 
represent Oxnard's future: a group of residents willing to look out for 
themselves rather than waiting for the city to ride to their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk a lot about changing the way we do things and, when you talk about 
change, you leave the comfort zone," Holden told the patrollers, who nodded and 
chanted their approval like churchgoers swept up in a religious revival. 
</P>
<P>
 "But just because it's not comfortable doesn't mean we shouldn't deal with 
it," he added. "The days of saying that the city is going to do it all alone 
are pretty much gone." 
</P>
<P>
 These, too, are unprecedented days in the life of the 39-year-old eye doctor 
turned politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden concluded his first year of City Council service last week. In that 
time, he has faced a room full of angry firefighters, roused by the council's 
consideration of a proposal to merge police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his fellow council members pulled the plug on a proposal to bring 
big-time gambling to Oxnard, an issue that split the community and ultimately 
prompted an investigation into possible laundering of campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 He has helped hire a new city manager, voted to put more police officers on 
the street and supported merging city departments as a way to cut costs without 
cutting services. 
</P>
<P>
 The job has been more work than Holden expected. Yet he has all but committed 
to running for reelection when his term expires in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very difficult not to run again," said Holden, who beat out 12 
rivals in a special election March 2, 1993, to fill the seat vacated when 
Manuel Lopez was elected mayor four months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a question of a system being broken. It is broken," Holden said in 
an interview. "But we -- the residents, city staff and the council -- are 
changing that, and I'm excited about the prospects for our city." 
</P>
<P>
 But some are less than comfortable about those prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard remains Ventura County's most crime-plagued city, and even the recent 
addition of eight police officers leaves the city short on crime fighters. Most 
park restrooms, closed years ago because of budget cuts, remain locked. 
</P>
<P>
 And some residents fear what Holden might mean when he talks about a city in 
need of change. Is it wise to merge city departments if the result is that the 
library is now headed by the recreation director? 
</P>
<P>
 Has the city that battles gangs and graffiti forgotten that youngsters also 
need recreation programs to keep them out of trouble? And will the City 
Council's zeal to boost the economic base translate into neglect of its poor 
and powerless? 
</P>
<P>
 "When a council becomes so interested in money, in the almighty dollar, then 
it's easy to lose sight of the best interest of the community," one longtime 
council observer said. "They don't understand; they don't see anything wrong 
with all this pro-growth. But it can be reckless and, in the end, gain the city 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said he believes that the city is in its best shape in years, and he 
doubts that many people would disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you are going to find a whole lot of residents who think that 
city government is changing too fast to become cost-effective and efficient," 
he said. "I think what they will say is that we are 10 years behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Holden best say it was his longing to return to a day when 
Oxnard was financially sound and services were plentiful that stoked his desire 
to seek elected office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He remembers Oxnard as being a small town, and I think he was concerned about 
the direction it was going," said Lisa Knapp, Holden's wife of six years and 
business partner. "He was frustrated in that he thought things could be done a 
lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Added his father, longtime Oxnard businessman Pat Holden: "He's probably one 
of the few people who still figures that one person can make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The Holden philosophy of orchestrating city government is actually quite 
simple: City Hall should be run like a business. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-generation Oxnard businessman campaigned on the idea that the city 
should strive for maximum efficiency in its attempt to provide the same level 
of municipal services for fewer dollars. He championed the cause of 
private-sector competition and, in some cases, advocated private management and 
operation of public programs. 
</P>
<P>
 And he stressed the need to find new approaches to old problems. 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been easy. He joined a panel that had been unable to reverse a 
financial slide that critics attributed to years of fiscal mismanagement, bad 
business deals, and the failure of past councils to make hard decisions about 
spending and saving. 
</P>
<P>
 And he inherited a stubborn budget shortfall that had whittled down the city's 
work force and gutted services over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't continue doing what we were doing and still be OK in the next 10 
years," Holden said. "The knee-jerk reaction is to cut services. It's much 
harder to really look at things and find ways to make them better." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, he joined his fellow council members last summer in reorganizing 
five departments in city government, in an effort to reduce costs without 
cutting services. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, he backed a move to put the city's economic development 
program in the hands of a private contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 His was the strongest voice in support of allowing private landscapers to 
compete with city crews to provide gardening services around some public 
walkways and medians. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time to balance the city's budget over the summer, Holden and 
other council members refused to adopt a spending plan calling for more service 
cuts. Instead, they saved money by reorganizing city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time in years, they agreed to take $500,000 from reserves to 
hire eight more police officers. Holden points out with pride that the reserve 
fund was repaid, with interest, earlier this month with money saved by 
downsizing city government. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Holden has not been alone. His election came four months after a 
hard-fought campaign forged a historic shift of power at Oxnard City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In that election, residents installed their first elected Latino mayor, first 
black councilman and only the fourth Latino councilman in Oxnard's 90-year 
history. Holden tapped into that formula for success. 
</P>
<P>
 He built a diverse coalition, recruiting many of the volunteers who helped 
organize Councilman Andres Herrera's successful campaign in November. He told 
voters that he was unlike previous council members, that he was a candidate 
willing to make bold changes to pull Oxnard out of its economic funk. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, he saw himself as a candidate who could appeal to a large 
cross-section of the city. Still, he is not without his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the citywide uproar over the card club proposal, critics note that 
Holden didn't decide against the project until the eleventh hour, in the face 
of an investigation by the county's top prosecutor into possible laundered 
campaign contributions and in front of a room full of people outraged that city 
leaders would consider such an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and the rest of the council should have never let it get that far," one 
observer said. "That issue clearly tore the community apart." 
</P>
<P>
 And affordable-housing advocates note that little has been done in the past 
year to better the conditions of thousands of Oxnard's poor, who live in 
garages and toolsheds or double and triple up with relatives just to scrape up 
rent money. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is still falling miserably short of its goal of building 1,450 
low-income units by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Holden recently joined a unanimous decision to back construction of a 
controversial low-income apartment complex in downtown Oxnard, activists say he 
missed other opportunities to beef up the city's low-income housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "His record hasn't been great, but he hasn't been alone in that," said Eileen 
McCarthy, a poverty lawyer. "But I hope to see a shift by Holden and the rest 
of the council during this coming year." 
</P>
<P>
 And some residents cringe at Holden's willingness to put public services in 
the hands of private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Former city employee John Zaragoza, who has already announced that he will 
seek election to the council in November, said Holden's approach to privatizing 
services could prove dangerous in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It amounts to passing the buck," Zaragoza said. "There is no accountability 
when you put a city service in the hands of a private contractor. Council 
members must live up to their responsibilities as elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden argues that he is doing exactly that. He said his responsibility is to 
ensure that taxpayers get the best value for their dollars, regardless of who 
provides the services. 
</P>
<P>
 "That philosophy has gotten us to where we are now," Holden said of Zaragoza 
and others. "That is part of the mentality that has kept us stuck in a mode 
where we continue to cut services to balance the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden has witnessed that decline firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born and raised in Oxnard. He attended Santa Clara Grammar School and 
graduated from Santa Clara High in 1972. Afterward, he went to work in his 
father's downtown Oxnard liquor store until he was 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom was the only one of my kids who didn't enroll in a four-year college," 
Pat Holden said. "He was kind of a late bloomer." 
</P>
<P>
 At 25, he started taking courses at Ventura College. Ten years after 
graduating from high school, he enrolled in the Southern California College of 
Optometry, where he met his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden and Knapp were married a month after she graduated from optometry 
school in 1987. They immediately moved to Oxnard and opened a practice together 
in late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 No one -- not his father nor his wife nor his close associates -- was 
surprised when Holden decided to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got the fire necessary to commit to the challenges he will 
face," said Barry Braff, an Oxnard optometrist who introduced Holden to the 
career during late-night poker parties. "The same thing that allowed him to put 
on a good bluff in a poker game will give him the strength to get through." 
</P>
<P>
 So Holden will continue to embrace change. Park restrooms are set to open soon 
under a plan that would put the chore of maintaining them into the hands of a 
private contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained to members of the Fremont neighborhood patrol how he recently 
learned that it took more than eight months of staff time to put up a couple of 
basketball hoops and resurface the courts at a city park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer afford to charge 40% more and take 10 times as long to 
accomplish something," he said. "The reasons the bathrooms were closed, the 
reason things have become so difficult, is because of an unwillingness to 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he told the neighborhood patrol group that it was the park restrooms 
that spurred his interest to run for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it basically symbolized where we had gotten to," Holden said. "I just 
looked at the situation and thought there has to be a better way."

2 ORCHESTRAS SQUABBLE OVER PLAZA SCHEDULING; THOUSAND OAKS: THE SYMPHONIES 
BICKER OVER WHICH SHOULD COME FIRST AT THE NEW PERFORMING ARTS CENTER, WHICH IS 
SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN OCTOBER. THEATER COMMISSION WILL REVIEW THE DISPUTE 
WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When first confronted with a noisy dispute between Ventura County's two 
symphony orchestras, Larry Janss labeled it "a clash of titans." 
</P>
<P>
 But half an hour of bickering later, Janss revised his metaphor, telling the 
symphony directors that their rivalry resembled "a lot of monkeys" mixing it up 
"in a small cage." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the analogy, the relationship between Thousand Oaks' Conejo Symphony 
and the Oxnard-based Ventura County Symphony has hit a sour note. And Janss -- 
a member of Thousand Oaks' theater commission -- will likely listen to a lot 
more dissonance this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of the City Council, the theater commission Wednesday will 
revisit the issue of when to schedule orchestral performances in the new Civic 
Arts Plaza's 1,800-seat auditorium, which opens in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the Conejo Symphony, Everett Ascher, has complained long and 
loud that the schedule as written gives an unfair boost to the out-of-town 
Ventura County Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has stripped away any lingering stereotypes of classical musicians 
as refined, sophisticated folk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, people who are very artistic in nature tend to get more emotional 
and more excited about issues," said Karine Beesley, executive director of the 
Ventura County Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuckling, theater veteran Tom Mitze added: "It's not genteel." 
</P>
<P>
 But as executive director of the Civic Arts Plaza auditorium, Mitze said he 
recognizes that "the issue of scheduling never goes away." 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, the case of the dueling symphonies is coming back again at 
Wednesday night's meeting -- a full month after theater commissioners thought 
that they had resolved the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by Councilman Frank Schillo, Ascher plans to plead for revisions in the 
opening week schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 His primary concern: Although his Conejo Symphony will preside over the 
performing arts center's grand opening, the rival Ventura County Symphony will 
launch its regular season of classical music with a splashy performance during 
the auditorium's first full week of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard-based group plans a "symphony orchestra blowout, with quadruple 
woodwinds and brass" and up to 100 musicians, Beesley said. The symphony may 
also weave some of its funky trademarks into the show by flashing colored 
spotlights on the musicians or displaying slides on an oversized screen behind 
the orchestra pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three days after its rival's sound-and-light extravaganza, the Conejo 
Symphony will kick off its own subscription series with a concert featuring 
renowned pianist Victor Borge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Symphony has snagged better dates -- the concerts with Borge are 
scheduled Saturday night and Sunday afternoon, whereas the Ventura County 
Symphony will perform on a Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mere fact that the Ventura County Symphony comes first in the schedule 
seemed a snub to Ascher and his Conejo Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo agreed, telling the council last week that the schedule disturbed him. 
Reluctant to step into a cultural war, the other council members decided to 
refer the matter to the seven-member theater commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would much rather this be handled by the Civic Theaters Commission," Mayor 
Elois Zeanah said. She added, however: "One of the reasons I'm excited about 
the new auditorium is that it will give the Conejo Symphony a place to perform. 
I certainly consider them our resident orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have always promised to give local groups priority in using the 
Civic Arts Plaza. Although they hope that the auditorium will gain fame as a 
regional cultural center, they also want it to serve as a showcase for 
home-grown talent. 
</P>
<P>
 By most reckonings, the Conejo Symphony qualifies as local. For 33 years, the 
orchestra has performed at a local school gym, wooing audiences despite the 
hard metal seats and occasional plink-plink of rain hitting the tin roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians, like the listeners, have proved loyal. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling professionals, they perform throughout Southern California. They 
play in many venues more glamorous than the California Lutheran University gym, 
but they return to Thousand Oaks season after season. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 75 to 90 musicians featured in each concert, most consider themselves 
Conejo Symphony veterans, Ascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these Thousand Oaks die-hards want to be the first to test Civic Arts 
Plaza's vaunted acoustics with a full-scale classical concert. Their director 
believes that it's their due, especially because the Conejo Symphony 
contributed nearly $400,000 to the Civic Arts Plaza fund-raising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the commitment of our orchestra, board of directors and symphony guild 
to the city, it's only right and fitting that we should open the regular season 
subscription series," Ascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ascher said he has "no particular problem" with the Ventura County Symphony 
performing on Conejo Symphony turf. They can play in the Civic Arts Plaza any 
time they want, he said, "but we just don't think they should have the 
privilege of opening the season subscription series." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Beesley professes amazement at the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand what's such a big deal here," she said. "We wanted to be 
part of opening week, and it would be foolish of us not to take advantage (of a 
free night). We think we have an orchestra that deserves to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Both symphonies have thrived for three decades in the county, with overlapping 
but largely distinct audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County orchestra draws most of its 1,100 season-ticket holders 
from west of the Conejo Grade, and the Thousand Oaks group reaches more than 
800 subscribers in the eastern valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestras also perform different types of music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Symphony usually sticks to familiar classical music, famous guest 
stars and scattered pop performances. "We don't perform the stuff of poets and 
prize committees, because that would drive our audience out of the house," 
Ascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Symphony, on the other hand, aims for more off-beat, 
experimental productions. Next year's season, for example, will feature a 
semi-staged opera and a musical interpretation of Shakespeare's "Midsummer 
Night's Dream" backed by a women's choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the distinct styles, the symphony directors worry that for some 
audiences, classical music is classical music. And too much classical music 
could turn potential patrons away from the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Symphony will perform three concerts there in the 1994-95 
season, and the Conejo Symphony will present seven shows plus the grand 
opening. Eventually, Beesley hopes to bring a full six-concert Ventura County 
Symphony series to the Thousand Oaks auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could easily happen that because of scheduling conflicts, both symphonies 
could end up bleeding to death," Ascher told the theater commission last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners declined to comment on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo eagerly jumped into the fray last week, telling the council that 
the schedule disturbed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may sound like a small thing, but (opening week) is a onetime event," he 
said. "I think there's something wrong when we have another symphony open the 
season at our Civic Arts Plaza, no matter how good they might be." Symphony 
Season 
</P>
<P>
 Season tickets to the Conejo Symphony's inaugural season in the Civic Arts 
Plaza will range in cost from $66.50 to $266 for seven performances. Ticket 
prices for individual concerts have not yet been determined. Here is the 
tentative program schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 29 and 30: Orchestral concert with pianist Victor Borge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 10: Performance with baritone Sylvester Blue and the Sherwood Singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 14: Concert featuring pianist Daniel Pollack playing Beethoven's Concerto 
No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 11: Program featuring the music of American composer Gordon Getty. 
</P>
<P>
 March 11: Concert featuring violinist Glenn Dicterow, concert master and 
soloist for the New York Philharmonic, playing Brahms violin concertos. 
</P>
<P>
 April 22, 1995: Concert with pianist Vladimir Feltsman. 
</P>
<P>
 May 30, 1995: Pops program featuring Shirley Jones, actress and singer who 
appeared in movies "Oklahoma!" and "Carousel."

SIMI MULLS FEE HIKE FOR STORM DRAIN MAINTENANCE; FINANCES: CITY STAFF 
RECOMMENDS NEARLY QUADRUPLING ASSESSMENT, WHICH WOULD INCREASE FROM $5.25 TO 
$20 PER HOUSEHOLD IF APPROVED.

<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council will hold a public hearing tonight on whether to 
nearly quadruple a fee residents pay to keep storm water from carrying 
pollutants through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also consider applying for a permit to launch a federally 
mandated program to monitor and purify storm water. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff is recommending that the council approve charging nearly $20 per 
household to cover the $733,000 annual cost of the city's Storm Water 
Management Program, Deputy Public Works Director Mike Kleinbrodt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides street and storm drain cleaning, as well as safe removal 
of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the council rejected a similar staff recommendation, approving an 
assessment of $5.25 per household, which raised less than $200,000. The rest of 
the funds came from the city Sanitation District's share of property tax 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis said he would oppose any increase over last year's fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand why staff would want to recover the entire cost of the 
program, but I have a real concern right now in raising any fees," Davis said. 
"With so many houses busted up in the earthquake, this is not the time to 
hammer on people." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, the council will consider approving a countywide 
application for a federally mandated program to rid storm water of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley, the county and its other nine cities recently formed the Ventura 
County Storm Water Management Task Force to share the costs of a storm 
pollution control program required by the federal Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's first tasks are to put together a storm water management 
proposal and get a pollution removal permit from the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 By acting as part of a larger district, Simi Valley reduces its share of the 
cost of these tasks. So far, the city has contributed $127,000 to the cost of 
preparing the proposal, less than half the estimated cost of applying alone, 
Kleinbrodt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, if the city acted alone, it could be required to construct as 
many as five water-monitoring stations, at a cost of $50,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 With the task force, however, only three additional stations may be required 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those stations are planned for Simi Valley, along the Arroyo Simi. The 
first is planned for the Alamo Street overpass between Wanda and Jasmine Glen 
avenues. The second is slated for the Heywood Street overpass between Erringer 
Road and Morley Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The location of a third, agricultural water-monitoring station has not been 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two monitoring stations in Oxnard, and one each in Camarillo and in 
Ventura.

CONTROVERSY GROWS OVER ANNEXATION; POLICE ISSUE SPLITS CABRILLO VILLAGE 
RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pancho Garcia, a 62-year-old retired farm laborer, has lived in Cabrillo 
Village for 30 years. In a few months, his neighborhood will become part of the 
city of Ventura, and he's pleased at the idea of changing from a county to city 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gangs are a problem," Garcia said. "The sheriff's deputies don't come too 
much. The police will come here more." 
</P>
<P>
 But down the street from Garcia, 26-year-old Steven Tellez, who was raised in 
Cabrillo, is far from happy about the annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sucks," Tellez said. "We have enough coverage from the sheriff's. Ventura 
police always feel we're up to something. We don't get bothered by the 
sheriff's deputies." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo Village is an unincorporated island, surrounded by the city of 
Ventura. City officials want to annex the 32-acre neighborhood to reduce 
confusion in providing police protection for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 As the annexation draws closer, Cabrillo Village residents say the topic has 
generated a lot of controversy within the tight-knit Latino community on 
Ventura's east end. One resident, who refused to be identified for fear of 
retaliation, said a neighbor's tires were slashed after a local newspaper 
quoted him as favoring the annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Cabrillo Village resident, who also declined to give his name, said 
the neighborhood is divided on the annexation issue because it will involve 
switching from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department to the Ventura Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The adults want it because they think more police will come, and the kids are 
against it because of the police supervision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as a farm laborers camp in the 1930s has blossomed into a sizable 
Latino enclave on the edge of Ventura, sandwiched between the Santa Clara River 
and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks, just west of Saticoy Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council will initiate the annexation at its meeting tonight. 
Cabrillo Village, which has 154 apartments and houses owned by the first 
cooperative housing association ever formed in Ventura County, is scheduled to 
be annexed later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Cabrillo's 1,000 residents, only 90 showed up at a meeting two weeks ago to 
vote on the annexation. Seventy-seven voted in favor, 13 against. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who favor annexation do so because they want better service from city 
police than they say they receive from county deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good because we will have more police," said Benito Martinez, 53. "They 
should come here at night; we have curfew problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But some youths in the community say they fear being hassled frequently by 
Ventura police officers, and are not pleased with the impending changeover in 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Ventura police met with Cabrillo residents and warned that 
they will cite parents of teen-agers who repeatedly violate the city's 10 p.m. 
curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz Muro, 90, who has lived in Cabrillo Village for 40 years, said he is 
afraid that the increased police presence will result in a tragedy later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police will come in here and kill one of the kids," Muro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say the low-income neighborhood is not a major crime 
problem. Still, older residents and parents say that beginning in the late 
1980s, the community began experiencing gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabrillo Campers, a gang of about 30 youths from the neighborhood, has a 
strong rivalry with the Ventura Avenue Gangsters, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been an ongoing beef between the two groups," said Sgt. Carl Handy, 
who heads Ventura police's gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
 That rivalry reached a violent climax in 1989, when a fatal shooting erupted 
in the neighborhood. Two men, who were not gang members, were killed in a 
drive-by shooting as they left a baptism party with a group of friends. Two 
other men were wounded in the attack by the Ventura Avenue gang. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Sheriff's Department, battery, shootings and vandalism have 
increased in the neighborhood since 1988, and the nature of the calls has 
become more serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo Village is being annexed at the request of the Local Agency Formation 
Commission, a state-sponsored county panel that regulates changes in boundaries 
for cities and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura has already annexed parcels of land on two sides of 
Cabrillo Village for new housing subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest change that will occur from the annexation is the switch in law 
enforcement agencies, city officials said. Cabrillo has received fire 
protection from the city, as well as water, sewer and trash services, for some 
time. Cabrillo also has some city-sponsored recreation programs, and children 
in the neighborhood already attend school in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The new housing developments to the east and west of Cabrillo Village could 
also have a long-term effect on the area, some residents say. The Paloma and 
North Bank Green subdivisions, which total about 250 homes, are being built and 
sold now. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellez said he thinks that the new homeowners who will move into the more 
upscale neighborhoods adjacent to Cabrillo will eventually pressure city 
officials to get rid of the community, which is home to many farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city takes over, it will get kind of ghetto-ized," Tellez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo's new neighbors, who are paying $160,000 to $175,000 for their 
houses, will be upset that they are living so close to an area that attracts 
gang members from Ventura Avenue, El Rio and Saticoy, Tellez said. 
</P>
<P>
 More negative attention will be focused on Cabrillo Village over time, and the 
neighborhood will be in danger of vanishing in a few decades, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people will pay a lot of money for their houses, while ours are a 
fraction of that," Tellez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city leaders say they think that Cabrillo's more wealthy neighbors will 
have the opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who live in Cabrillo Village have pride of ownership, and I think 
that with nice developments going up around them, it will only increase their 
pride of ownership," Councilman Gregory L. Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo Village is hardly a ghetto now. Not every house has a well-kept lawn, 
but many have fresh coats of paint, and the majority are well maintained. Some 
have white picket fences in front. Graffiti and vandalism are not apparent, and 
residents tuck their cars in garages and carports instead of parking them on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood is, in many ways, a self-contained community. There are only 
two ways to enter Cabrillo Village. It has a small one-story church, market, 
laundry room, community center, library and playground. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino heritage of its residents is apparent from such street names as 
Cinco de Mayo and Si Se Puede. The small market specializes in Latino foods, 
and Latino street vendors come into the neighborhood frequently to sell corn 
and deep-fried churros . 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Martinez, a 20-year-old Ventura College student, said the whole 
neighborhood gathers after Mass on Sunday to watch soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows each other here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first houses in Cabrillo Village were little more than wooden shacks, 
built by Saticoy Lemon Co. in 1937 to house its fieldworkers. 
</P>
<P>
 When a health and safety inspector condemned the village and the packing 
company's labor contract had expired, the entire housing project was set to be 
razed in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents stopped the bulldozers by holding hands and forming a human 
shield around the houses. With the help of the Catholic Church and the United 
Farm Workers, they halted the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm workers formed a housing cooperative and raised $80,000 for the first 
down payment to buy the 80 houses and the property from Saticoy Lemon Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the community has added 74 apartments to its housing association, 
which is run by a seven-member board elected by residents. Residents pay 
monthly rent ranging from $220 to $450, which goes to the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Slade, housing administrator for the association, said turnover in the 
village is very low. Last year, only two people moved out, he said. When there 
is a vacancy, Slade turns to a waiting list with more than 100 names. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the apartments were built with federal money and, in order to qualify 
to live there, residents must be farm workers or work in agricultural-related 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Villanueva, a packer at Saticoy Lemon Co., said she is hoping that 
Ventura police will do a better job than sheriff's deputies in watching the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son, who is 14, is at the stage where he's hanging out with the gang 
members in the neighborhood," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, deputies and Ventura police say Cabrillo Village is not that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really a trouble area for us," Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Bruce 
Norris said. "They have kids that dress the part, but they're more likely to 
just mouth off." 
</P>
<P>
 Norris said deputies who patrol the area respond to some shootings, but with 
the exception of the highly publicized attack in 1989, few people have been 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's surprising how many times you go down there and there aren't any 
victims," Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the physical layout of Cabrillo Village, with its two entrances and 
numerous speed bumps, outside gang members are likely to be discouraged from 
coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris said only two deputies in one patrol car are assigned to the area. He 
said deputies drop in about 10 times a day, either responding to calls or just 
doing routine patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Police Department takes over, Norris said, it may send more officers 
than the Sheriff's Department because Ventura police patrol a smaller area. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two and up to six Ventura police officers will be in the Cabrillo 
Village area, Ventura police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may see a little more police presence," said Ventura Police Officer 
Ralph Martinez, who was raised in Cabrillo Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cabrillo youths and some residents say most of the problems stem from 
outside gangs coming into the neighborhood, Martinez discounts that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say they're innocent bystanders," Martinez said of his former 
neighborhood. "Sometimes the kids are the provocateurs. But they're not as 
hard-core and they're not as sophisticated as some of the other gangs in the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few youths in the Cabrillo Campers gang are considered major 
troublemakers, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've gone from drinking beer to some serious crimes such as vehicle 
burglary, but I would not say they're violent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustavo Hurtado, 19, said he was pressured to join the Cabrillo Campers, but 
has successfully avoided it. "I didn't want to do anything stupid to screw up 
the rest of my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nico Esquivel, who grew up in Cabrillo and has since moved into one of the new 
adjacent subdivisions, said he is pleased that police will be enforcing curfew 
in his former neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Tellez, who is worried that Cabrillo's crime and its new neighbors will 
be the area's downfall, Esquivel says the new subdivisions will help lessen 
Cabrillo's gang problems over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people begin to complain on both sides of the village," Esquivel said, 
"police protection will increase and keep the gangs out. You have taxpayers 
complaining and things will change."

STREET SMART: RETROFITTING OVERPASSES A PRIORITY OVER WIDENING BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The two-lane bridge on California 150 crossing San Antonio Creek on the east 
side of Ojai is narrow and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 California 150 is a popular bike riding route from Ojai to Soule (Recreation 
Area) and on to Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, this is the most direct route into town for the residents of 
east Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bicyclists and pedestrians have no choice but the ride/walk in the 
traffic lanes. To cross the bridge, they are forced to compete with cars 
traveling 45 to 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 This creates an extremely dangerous situation, especially with the amount of 
automobile, bicycle and foot traffic over the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this bridge be widened and a bicycle lane added? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael R. Laber, Ojai 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, there are no plans to widen or change the bridge over San Antonio 
Creek, says Tony Colella, senior Caltrans engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it does sound like there is a safety concern at the bridge, the state 
Department of Transportation has just embarked on a major bridge retrofitting 
project to make 45 overpasses in Ventura County -- and 1,000 around the state 
-- more earthquake-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, that project takes top priority, so your bridge widening may have 
to wait. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 How hard would it be to change the left-turn arrows at two consecutive 
intersections on Telephone Road in Ventura to allow more time for turning? 
</P>
<P>
 At both Clinton and Montgomery avenues, drivers are only allowed to turn left 
on a green arrow. Then the arrow turns red and you have to wait through a full 
light cycle for another chance to turn left. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the red arrow be removed so that drivers could turn left on green? It 
seems like these intersections are open and wide enough so that drivers can see 
oncoming traffic and make safe left turns on green. 
</P>
<P>
 One place where this works well is the intersection of Telephone and Saticoy 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this change be made? 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy J. Troske, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be hard, but it would be expensive to change the two intersections 
to allow motorists to turn left on a green light. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been major changes in state traffic signal regulations since the 
lights were installed at Clinton and Montgomery avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 So removing a red left-turn arrow isn't as simple as replacing it with a new 
signal. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-turn signals now at the two intersections are anchored to the median, 
a design Caltrans no longer permits. 
</P>
<P>
 To switch to left turn on green, new overhead signals, which cost $35,000 
apiece, must be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 But take heart. Traffic engineer Nazir Lalani agrees that left turns should be 
permitted on green lights, and the funding is on the city's list of future 
projects. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm writing about a problem that for me is like fingernails on a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about a pothole. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't just any pothole, but a sneaky little thing that gets me every time 
I drive down Los Angeles Avenue in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason it's such a problem is that it's in the left-turn lane right before 
you get to Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 There's only one left-turn lane, so if you're turning left, you're bound to 
hit it. Unless you remember it's there ahead of time, boom, down you go. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the city fix this thing before it gets worse? 
</P>
<P>
 Kellie Linder, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 That pothole is history. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on your complaint, city workers rushed out and filled the hole, says 
Traffic Engineer Bill Golubics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to take care of these problems right away," Golubics said. "But we 
don't see everything." 
</P>
<P>
 If you'd like to see all your pothole problems addressed this efficiently, 
report the nasty road dips to the Public Works Department by calling 583-0393.

NEW TO THE SYSTEM; LAID-OFF PROFESSIONALS AND SKILLED LABORERS SEEKING WELFARE 
AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More and more fired and laid-off workers are joining Ventura County's 
hard-core unemployed in welfare lines, asking for their chunks of a dwindling 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of family welfare cases rose by almost 20% to include 11,557 in 
1993, according to the latest report from the Public Social Services Agency, 
with unemployment-related cases jumping by more than one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's welfare reforms pared the amount of aid available to 
Ventura County welfare recipients to $6.53 million in 1993, or 8.4% more than 
the amount spent in 1992, said the report, which was released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest of the poor -- laid-off professionals and skilled laborers -- are 
frustrated and insulted by the process, caseworkers say. 
</P>
<P>
 They simply cannot believe how little welfare pays. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just roll their eyes and go, 'My goodness, how do they expect you to 
live on this?' " said Karl Arasmith, a welfare caseworker in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The county welfare system helps indigent people through three programs: the 
state-funded, general relief program for single adults; the Aid to Families 
with Dependent Children program, and the federal food stamp program. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the newest recipients are jobless workers whose state-managed 
unemployment benefits have run out. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuts to welfare benefits over the past two years have shaved the monthly 
welfare check for two people -- for example, a mother and child with no income 
-- from $535 to $490. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'I can't even rent an apartment on that,' " Arasmith said. "And (I) 
say, 'Well, you've got to redo some of your thinking.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Food stamp grants, $206 a month for two people with no income, have increased 
only slightly in recent years, and recipients often complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're always running out of food in the middle of the month," said Retha 
Meurs, a caseworker in the Oxnard-based office that oversees Camarillo, Port 
Hueneme, Santa Paula, Fillmore and Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 For many new welfare recipients, shame comes with the handout. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last four months, we've seen more people that apply that have degrees 
and their companies have folded and moved out of the county," Meurs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most are pretty embarrassed," she said. "When they come in, they say, 'I'm 
only going to do this for a month.' A lot of them end up getting off (welfare) 
after six months -- they have degrees, they're looking for other work. But some 
end up staying on the aid because they can't find a job." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not for lack of trying, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Social Services Agency works to prod people off public assistance 
and into jobs as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It offers more aid to people who find temporary work. The agency's Greater 
Avenues for Independence program provides mandatory job counseling for nearly 
all welfare recipients except disabled people, pregnant women in their third 
trimester and mothers with children under age 3, Meurs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the caseload increases as the economy keeps more people out of work 
longer, said Karla Olander, who oversees the welfare offices countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in cases, she said, could mean that recipients are staying on welfare 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be an indicator that there are more people staying on longer and 
their unemployment benefits are running out," Olander said. "They're having to 
come to us for help, whereas before they were probably going back to work 
before they lost their unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 As laid-off workers add to the new cases, so do the more traditional types of 
welfare recipients, said Teresa Elenes, manager of the Camarillo-Santa Paula 
welfare office in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pretty used to the third or fourth generation of people coming in, 
where we know the grandmother and mother," she said. "We hear stories of 
younger people . . . now their kids are wanting their own case files. Your 
heart goes out to these (other) people that have worked all their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare application forms ask intimate details of personal lives and take 
more than an hour to fill out, said Maria Older, Ventura district office 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ask you everything under the sun, and some of it's very personal," she 
said. "It's worse than the income tax form." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill of Simi Valley, who declined to give his last name, reluctantly applied 
last week for welfare and food stamps. He is trying to retrain himself after a 
back and leg injury ended his job as a spray painter. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a "pinkie," as Simi Valley caseworkers call the first-time applicants 
who carry their pink application forms into the clutch of cramped cubicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunkered over the desk in a 7-by-9-foot cubicle with caseworker Valerie 
Wilson, Bill answered several personal questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Who is his landlord? How old is his landlord? Who lives in his house with him? 
Are they working? Do they share or prepare meals there with him? Are any of 
them illegal immigrants? Does he have any bank accounts? Does he own any real 
estate or personal property? What kind of car does he drive? 
</P>
<P>
 Then she read him his rights, saying he must keep answering such questions if 
he hopes to receive aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are required to cooperate with the county, state or federal staff," 
Wilson said, reading the governmental fine print. "You may not get benefits, or 
your benefits will be stopped if you do not cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 As the interview continued, he told a reporter: "I'm just really doing what I 
have to do to make ends meet. I don't like it at all. It's very uncomfortable. 
I was always brought up that you pull your own weight around and you don't like 
to get handouts." 
</P>
<P>
 As difficult as the application process is, there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 Many laid-off professionals have too much money set aside or earn unemployment 
benefits that disqualify them for welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for them," Arasmith said. "They're amazed at what our gross income 
and property limits are. One-third don't even qualify because they exceed our 
maximum limits." 
</P>
<P>
 Single applicants for food stamps must earn no more than $756 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them are OK with it, but others are mad at the system," he said. 
"They feel they paid into the system. . . . They curse you out and say things 
like, 'If I were a Mexican, Spanish-speaking person here illegally with 12 
kids, you'd be giving me aid.' That's not true, but that's how they feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian Sharples fumed on the sidewalk outside the Simi Valley welfare office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharples said she was two months behind on her rent after GTE fired her while 
she was seeking workers' compensation for job-related stress. She said 
caseworkers warned her that she will probably be turned down for welfare 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that she owns a 10-year-old Cadillac. She cannot prove to 
caseworkers that she is unable to get work or visit doctors without a car, but 
she would not get much if she sold the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "After nearly 30 years working in this country, my country's telling me to go 
live out on the street," groused Sharples, 48, who is originally from 
Liverpool, England. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to borrow money from my friend just to buy toilet paper," she said, 
"after working and paying into this system for 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 As the caseload grows, welfare offices countywide are running out of space, 
caseworkers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, caseworkers sometimes must meet clients in conference rooms 
because all the cubicles are occupied, said Kathi Strahl, district manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Caseworkers who once handled 145 cases a month now handle 185 a month, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, clients from Camarillo and Santa Paula often wait up to an hour for 
a caseworker and a cubicle, Meurs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra caseworkers added to the regional offices force staff to squeeze 
themselves and case files into conference rooms, Elenes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put workers and cases in every nook and cranny that we could," she said. 
"We are at our capacity with the spaces we have."

AT 99, HE STILL MANAGES TO TRAVEL IN THE FAST LANE; SENIORS: DRIVERS IN JOHN 
CHAPMAN'S BRACKET ARE MALIGNED, BUT HAVE FEWER ACCIDENTS THAN THE YOUNG. AND HE 
ACED HIS RECENT DMV TEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's just say John H. Chapman deserves the very senior citizen discount on 
his car insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, this 99-year-old former mechanic is not only of sound mind and body, 
he still drives. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of his pet peeves: Older people who drive too slowly for their own -- 
and everybody else's -- good. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get on the freeway and there's a slow mover, nine times out of 10 you 
look over and it's an old gray-hair. I say, if you can't keep up with the flow 
of traffic, well then, maybe you ought not be on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's cruise control: "Don't trust it." 
</P>
<P>
 Metered on-ramps: "Do they do any good? You wait 15, 16 seconds, and when you 
get on the freeway it's still congested." 
</P>
<P>
 And factory-installed cassette decks: "I guess you're supposed to put records 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, actually, it's for tapes, but such innovations were hardly de rigueur 
when Chapman first hit the road in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessed with a ready wit and vigor to spare, Chapman recently walked into a 
Department of Motor Vehicles building in Laguna Hills, aced a driving test and 
got a new license. It authorizes him to be driving past the age of 100, which 
he will reach next February, and makes him one of the oldest registered drivers 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all I want," said the man who was born the year before actor-comedian 
George Burns, everybody's favorite senior citizen, "to be able to say I drove 
at 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, as of July, 1993, dozens of Californians over the age of 99 had been 
issued driver's licenses -- although Chapman may be the only one of them who 
still uses the fast lane. And while there's a widespread perception that 
Chapman and his fellow nonagenarians and centenarians are menaces on the road, 
it's not entirely deserved, or true. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of age-ism going around," state Department of Motor Vehicles 
spokesman Evan Nossoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Older drivers actually get in fewer accidents each year than very young 
drivers, according to the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
 For every 100 drivers 85 and over, an average of 4.8 are involved in accidents 
each year. By comparison, for every 100 drivers 16 to 19 years old, 9.4 are in 
accidents in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers of ages 45 through 84 have the fewest accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 While DMV statistics show that drivers over the age of 85 are involved in more 
serious accidents per mile than other age groups, it's roughly equivalent to 
the danger posed by younger drivers -- 4.5 accidents per one million miles for 
drivers 16 to 19, compared to 5.5 accidents per million miles for drivers 85 
and up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, said the DMV's Nossoff, if people over 70 were to be barred from 
driving because of the increased danger they posed, "we'd have to -- on the 
same grounds -- take licenses away from men under the age of 24 and women under 
the age of 20." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of impaired vision and duller reflexes, older drivers do tend to drive 
slower and make ill-advised turns and lane changes. But statistics show time 
and again that the most dangerous violation is speeding, and older drivers, as 
a group, aren't guilty of that anywhere near as often as their younger 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, three of every 100 drivers 85 and over are ticketed each year -- the 
lowest number in any age group, according to the DMV. By comparison, 42 of 
every 100 drivers in the 20 to 24 age group are ticketed each year. Not 
surprisingly, the highest number of tickets -- 47 each year -- involves the 
16-to-19 group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What it is," Nossoff said, "is that people, as they get older, are annoying 
to be on the road with, but they're not more dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 As further proof, he offers: 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 34 oldest drivers in the state -- an elite group that includes a 
104-year-old man and probably will soon include Chapman -- there have been two 
accidents in the last three years, resulting in injuries to two people, 
"although," Nossoff said, "I can't guarantee all 34 of those people are still 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 "The best indicator of a person's driving ability is the driving record, not 
the ability to pass tests or age." Nossoff said. Which means plucking a license 
from someone like Chapman isn't exactly just, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are we to mess with Mother Nature and survival of the fittest?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, who said his only health problem is having too much potassium ("and 
I'm not sure that's a problem," he said), actually serves as a perfect example 
of why some older drivers are safer bets than younger ones: They're 
experienced, they drive less and they stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The year Chapman started driving, George V ascended the British throne. 
Congress passed the Mann Act, which prohibited transportation of women across 
state lines "for immoral purposes." And Madam Curie published her "Treatise on 
Radiography." 
</P>
<P>
 In three years Chapman has logged only 4,800 miles on his glossy white Saturn, 
which he washes himself. ("Why not? I've got nothing but time," he said.) 
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes to wrongs committed against him by other drivers, "mostly 
young fellas," he subscribes to the turn-the-other-cheek school of thought, a 
school that few Southern California drivers have attended, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, he padded out of his Irvine townhome, ascended a half-flight 
of stairs and climbed into his car with the dexterity of a man half his age, 
shortly before darting off to see the "tax man." 
</P>
<P>
 As he chugs down the San Diego Freeway he's no speed demon, but he doesn't 
mind pushing it to 60, even 65, to keep up with the flow of traffic. In fact, 
he thinks the speed limit should be increased. "Cars today are . . . made to go 
faster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the older-drivers-aren't-safe debate, he says, "A lot of elderly people do 
go too slow. But it depends on the physical makeup of the person. I don't think 
I'm any hazard to other drivers, but then again I don't necessarily go slow 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the thousands of miles of roads he's driven, what's his favorite stretch? 
"The 17-Mile Drive" on the Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 His worst driving experience? As a young man in Los Angeles, he was once 
struck by a street car equipped with a cowcatcher and carried half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst car he ever owned? A Hupmobile, produced by the defunct Hupp Motor 
Car Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Best car? An Oldsmobile, but he admits to being partial because he worked for 
the company for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The next car he'd like to buy? "I'd like to have a new car, but it'd be 
foolish to buy one now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am close to 100, you know."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA / YORBA LINDA; SCHOOL BOARD TO TALK OF METAL 
DETECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District officials want to use hand-held 
metal detectors at all of the district's middle schools and high schools in an 
effort to find weapons on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time they say that the district has no major problem with 
weapons and that using the detectors would be a preventive measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed policy, to be considered at a Board of Trustees meeting Tuesday 
night, would not limit weapons searches to certain grade levels, but Supt. 
James O. Fleming said the effort would focus on the district's continuation 
school, five middle schools and three high schools. He did not rule out using 
the devices at elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society is changing," Fleming said. "We're seeing more violent things happen. 
This policy gives schools another tool to make our campuses safer." 
</P>
<P>
 So far this school year, the district has expelled 13 students for carrying 
weapons. None of the weapons found were firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Jerry Brakebill, a Brea police detective and former DARE officer, said 
hand-held metal detectors should be used not just at schools but at athletic 
events, school dances and other school-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metal detectors are effective as a deterrent," Brakebill said. "I would like 
to see them used, particularly at special events." 
</P>
<P>
 Brakebill said the district has been lucky so far in avoiding serious problems 
with weapons on campuses. But, he added, even one weapon is cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute you have one kid bring a weapon on a campus, it is a problem," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dennis Kreil, director of pupil services, many of the students 
disciplined for carrying weapons were caught with relatively harmless pocket 
knives, but the district does not make a distinction between those and other 
types of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to send a strong message to the students that no weapons or potential 
weapons can be brought on campus," Kreil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, students who are found with weapons have been turned in by other 
students, most often in middle schools, where students generally bring weapons 
to school to show off to their friends, according to Kreil. 
</P>
<P>
 "A student will have the weapon in his backpack and on the way to school or 
even at school will take it out and show it to someone," Kreil said. "Another 
student sees it and reports it to a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 While middle school students are apt to tell teachers about weapons, high 
school students are more reluctant to turn in another student, Kreil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kreil credits high school students with being more aware of the ban on weapons 
and said they are less likely to bring knives or guns on campus merely to show 
off. This makes discovering weapons more difficult and their presence more 
dangerous, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a high school student has a weapon, they usually have an idea about the 
weapon that is more likely to include (using it)," Kreil said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will discuss the policy at Tuesday's board meeting but will not vote 
on it until the next meeting, on April 12. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FUNDS FOR CROSSING GUARDS ON AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Giving up hopes of receiving county funding, Thousand Oaks council members 
Tuesday will consider spending $2,820 to provide crossing guards for two 
elementary schools through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many students at Walnut and Madrona elementary schools live in 
unincorporated areas, Thousand Oaks officials last fall sought partial county 
reimbursement for the cost of providing crossing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 While they waited for a response, council members agreed to spend city funds 
to support crossing-guard service for six months -- a period that will end 
March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that county supervisors have made it clear that they will not contribute 
funds, the council must decide whether to continue the crossing-guard program 
at Wendy and Ruth drives, and Camino Manzanas and Marian Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Service through the end of the school year would cost $2,820, and several 
council members indicated that they would be willing to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is nominal, and public safety must be our No. 1 concern," Mayor 
Elois Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that the county won't do it, but it's still our 
responsibility." STEPHANIE SIMON

 Drinking water in Simi Valley in 1993 met all state and federal health 
standards, city officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff report to be considered by the City Council today says water supplied 
by the city-owned Waterworks District No. 8 met government health and purity 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 About two-thirds of the city's residents are supplied by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The other third receive water from Southern California Water Co., which has 
not yet released its water quality information for 1993. SARA CATANIA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; CITY OKS TRASH FEE HIKE DESPITE PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After postponing action at two previous meetings, the City Council last week 
voted 5 to 0 to approve an increase in sanitation fees to help pay for a new 
material-recovery facility slated to open April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The average single-family residence will see monthly sanitation bills increase 
by $1.04, bringing them to about $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite opposition from a dozen speakers over three different hearings, the 
council decided last week that the city must have the fee hike in order to meet 
a state mandate to divert 25% of its garbage from landfills by 1995. If it 
fails to satisfy the goal, the city could be fined up to $10,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is wrong," said Carole Walters, president of the Orange 
Taxpayers Assn. "The taxpayer out there is mad, and they will show it" at 
election time. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members contended that their votes were dictated by the state 
mandate. "I think it's apparent no one likes rate increases," said Councilman 
Mark Murphy. "From my perspective, there is not a lot of choice here." 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility will be able to process up to 1,500 tons of waste per day. 
But city officials estimate that Orange will use only a third of the facility's 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is negotiating to sell use of the facility to neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have excess capacity, and we are looking for customers," said Phil Pierce 
of the Public Works Department. MARTIN MILLER

<P>
 A Ventura County group that gives advice on activities affecting senior 
citizens is accepting applications for new members. 
</P>
<P>
 Members will advise the Ventura County Area Agency on Aging, make 
recommendations on funding, and act as a liaison between the agency and the 
senior citizen community, said spokeswoman Karen Mondragon. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory council meets at least 10 times a year, she said. Applications 
submitted will be forwarded to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, which 
will appoint 19 members by July 1, Mondragon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Application blanks are available at the Area Agency on Aging office, 505 Poli 
St., Ventura, or by calling 652-7560, she said. Completed applications must be 
submitted no later than April 20. KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LA COLONIA FESTIVAL CELEBRATES DRUG- AND ALCOHOL-FREE LIFE

 Watching his 2-year-old daughter tear into messy, buttery corn on the cob, 
Agustin Abarca said Sunday's drug- and alcohol-free celebration in Oxnard was 
the kind of community event he liked to go to with his young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good for the kids," said Abarca, 27. "It's good for them to see 
people having fun without alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 Abarca, his wife, Martha, 26, and daughters Alexandra, 2, and Valerie, 11 
months, were among the thousands who visited Del Sol Park on Sunday to 
celebrate Tardeada en el Parque Sin Alcohol y Drogas, or Festival in the Park 
Without Alcohol and Drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was sponsored by the Colonia Coalition on Alcohol and Other Drugs. 
Officials said they expected 7,000 people to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, formed about eight months ago to fight substance abuse in the 
low-income La Colonia neighborhood, is made up of members from the La Colonia 
Village Tenants Assn., Oxnard Police Department, Oxnard Housing Authority, 
Ventura County Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, and El Concilio del 
Condado de Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Lazer, a Spanish-language radio station, also participated in the event, 
playing music from loudspeakers while professional dancers performed on the 
grass. Booths sold food or promoted local commercial or civic organizations, 
such as a photography studio, health agency and Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to promote a clean and sober community event," said Noelia Chavez, 
coordinator of El Concilio's community health education programs. "This is a 
kickoff to show the community what can be done if the community gets involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said part of the point, too, was to impress on children that they 
could have fun without drugs or alcohol. Some teen-agers, however, weren't sure 
that it would have an effect beyond the youngest children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird that they're doing this right here in Colonia," said Maria 
Barajas, 16. "Right here, this is where the homies live, and they'll probably 
come here and (shoot up drugs) in front of people. I don't think it'll change 
anything, though it might help the little kids." CONSTANCE SOMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TEENS BRING DANCE, FOOD AND FUN TO KIDS

<P>
 Ignoring the gloomy, overcast sky that threatened rain, about 180 low-income 
and homeless children laughed and played together Saturday at a party thrown 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 During the mid-morning event, the children, who were invited to the party from 
poor neighborhoods and homeless shelters around the county, watched dance 
performances, did arts and crafts and received free food and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 volunteers, mostly high school students from throughout the county, 
organized the party event, which was held at the Southwest Minority Economic 
Development Assn. building on 2nd Street in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 After munching on chocolate chip cookies and drawing in his new coloring book, 
Luis Varrios, 12, said he admired the high school students who made the party 
possible. "They're very responsible to do this. I think it's very nice on their 
part," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, members of the Youth Leadership Council of the Volunteer Center 
of Greater Orange County, said the goal of the party was to provide a good time 
for the children as a way of helping the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public image of teen-agers is that we don't care, but that's really 
untrue," said Joe Sanberg, 14, who help coordinate the event. "We want to give 
back to the community, which has given so much to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Sewell, 27, emcee for the event, said the party was important because 
"it provides alternative (activities) for children and gives them a fun, good 
time they might not otherwise have had. It brings the community closer 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Chavez, 37, who came with his children, said he appreciated the 
tangible gifts. And he added that it is also "helpful for the small kids to see 
what the high school students are doing, because they make good role models." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in joining volunteer projects throughout the county may call 
the Volunteer Center at (714) 953-5757. JON NALICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously approved a plan to build a recreational 
facility, including a golf driving range, at the site of an abandoned school. 
</P>
<P>
 Super Sports Inc. and the Orange Unified School District received the city's 
endorsement last week to build a golf practice range with 100 tees at the 
former Peralta Junior High School site, 2190 N. Canal St. The facility will 
also feature chipping bunkers, putting greens, a golf academy and a pro shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility will also include a soccer field, volleyball courts, batting 
cages, a baseball diamond and tennis courts. Outdoor lights will be installed 
at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The development also calls for converting a former science building into a 
child care center. The center will be able to care for about 118 children. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 30 existing parking spaces, 285 new off-street parking 
spaces will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, however, voted down a proposal to hold bingo games at the new 
facility. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; CITY REJECTS BANK'S REQUEST FOR AWNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has refused to allow the Bank of America to install bright 
red awnings over an automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
 However, council members, who voted 3 to 2 last week against the bank's 
request, directed the Planning Commission to consider changing the design plan 
for La Habra Boulevard, where the bank branch is located.The plan currently 
prohibits any metal or vinyl awnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America officials said the awning would have been placed behind their 
building, out of view from the street. They said they wanted vinyl awnings 
because it is easier to cover them with graffiti-resistant paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Only cloth awnings are currently permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the design guidelines for the boulevard, bright colors must be 
approved by the Planning Commission, which denied the bank's request two months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also rejected the proposed vinyl canopies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the buildings that line La Habra Boulevard were built in the 1940s, 
and the Planning Commission had approved the design guidelines to give the 
street an "early California-Spanish" architectural style. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines state that cloth awnings provide a "soft look" and are 
consistent with the style. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is within our power to make exceptions once in a while," Councilman Juan 
M. Garcia said about the guidelines. He and Mayor David M. Cheverton cast the 
only votes in favor of the vinyl awnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work with businesses here as much as possible," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William D. Mahoney agreed with the rest of the council to ask the 
Planning Commission to reconsider the design guidelines for La Habra Boulevard.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SPECIAL BUS SERVICE FOR DISABLED TO START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Coast Area Transit will begin complementary curb-to-curb service for 
disabled Ventura County residents starting this summer, the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 In cooperation with SCAT, the commission is certifying individuals who need 
the service, which is similar to a dial-a-ride or taxi service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that fixed-route bus systems such 
as SCAT be accessible to disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare for the new service will not exceed $2 one way, which is twice the 
amount of an adult bus fare, commission officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 SCAT is planning to begin its curb-to-curb service in July, but eligible 
individuals must become certified as soon as possible so that the bus system 
can tailor its services to their needs, commission officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible, individuals must be unable to use a fixed-route bus because 
they are either physically or mentally unable to board, ride or disembark an 
accessible bus, or their disability prevents them from traveling to or from a 
bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals must fill out an application, describe their disability and attend 
a brief interview to be certified for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they are certified, an ADA identification card will be issued. 
</P>
<P>
 For applications or information, call (800) 438-1112. TRACY WILSON

 For the fourth year in a row, the Simi Valley City Council will consider

</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the request, which is up for consideration at today's

fair. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, council members have approved the plan, saying the free service

businesses. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; TUMBLEWEED CLEANUP COST $1,300 IN 1993 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley property owners who failed to remove tumbleweeds and other debris 
from their properties cost the city more than $1,300 in 1993, according to a 
staff report to be presented today to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to bill the owners for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Each fall, the city inspects all vacant parcels to determine which ones 
contain an overgrowth of tumbleweeds, also known as Russian thistle. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 230 properties were identified, and owners were sent letters asking 
them to voluntarily remove the tumbleweeds, which often break free in Santa Ana 
winds and blow through streets and residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one eventually removed the weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which spent $1,363 sending out the warnings and cleaning up the 
property, will bill owners who were late in cleaning up and those who failed to 
do so at all for the cost of the program. SARA CATANIA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RIVER FLOOD-CONTROL WORK MOVES AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana River flood-control project is moving upstream with the 
completion of another phase of construction through Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 A "construction turnover" ceremony Friday at Suburbia I Park, on the river's 
edge, marked completion of the $32-million second phase of the project, which 
stretched from Adams Avenue in Huntington Beach to just above the San Diego 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major project that we've waited a long time for. It's good to see 
it moving forward," said Herbert Nakasone, manager of flood programs for the 
county's environmental management agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Andrews, Army Corps of Engineers project manager for the lower Santa 
Ana River, said the second phase was started in April, 1992, with a completion 
target of November, 1993, but was delayed by rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The project included building a 2.3-mile concrete lining for the river 
channel, Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase is part of the $1.4-billion Santa Ana River Mainstem Flood 
Control Project, which will provide increased flood protection for those who 
live in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said the entire project is two years ahead of schedule and getting 
done at a savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We accelerated our design schedule to take advantage of the good bidding 
climate. We're getting good prices," he said. They are "coming in lower than 
expected. So it's good for the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the river upstream to just below Prado Dam on the eastern outskirts of 
Orange County is expected to be completed by the year 2000, Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, the first phase of the project between Pacific Coast Highway to 
south of Adams Avenue was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction on Phase Three, north of the San Diego Freeway to Warner Avenue 
in Fountain Valley, has also been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said that work is slated to begin in mid-April on the next phase, 
continuing north to 17th Street in Santa Ana, with completion scheduled for 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 He said construction-vehicle traffic will be routed in a way to minimize the 
impact on local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclists, joggers and others who use the river trail will be detoured onto 
city streets during this phase of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail remains open from Pacific Coast Highway to Warner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said a contract is expected to be awarded for the fifth and sixth 
phases next month, with construction to begin in late April. 
</P>
<P>
 That part of the project is between 17th and Glassell streets in Orange, with 
construction winding up in November, 1995. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; REACTION TO NEW SENIOR SITE MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Years of lobbying, fund raising and waiting will end for the city's 14,000 
senior citizens on April 9 when a state-of-the-art senior center and adult day 
care facility opens its doors on a lake in the Woodbridge village. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some seniors, the opening is a mixed blessing, because it could lead 
to several changes, including the partial closure of Irvine's other senior 
center about a mile away on Sandburg Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Irvine officials have suggested renting out portions of the existing 
senior center as a way of generating additional city revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials insist that any changes to the Sandburg center won't occur for 
several years -- and only after officials consult center patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some seniors are nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense to leave both of them opened," said 87-year-old Ethel Irish 
Coplen, who frequents the Sandburg senior center. "We need to have them both." 
</P>
<P>
 Coplen and other seniors have long been pushing for a second senior facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The new $7-million, 3,593-square-foot complex on Alton Parkway will house 
meeting rooms, an auditorium and a library, as well as a large kitchen where 
food for a meals-on-wheels program will be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult day care center will offer medically supervised services to frail 
and disabled seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sandburg center is more modest. 
</P>
<P>
 But many seniors are accustomed to using the facility for aerobics classes, 
lunches, health seminars and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Coplen said that more than 200 seniors have moved into apartments and town 
houses on Sandburg Way over the years so that they could live close to the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if all the seniors are going to be able to make it to 
Woodbridge," Coplen said. "I don't know how some of them would get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, city officials and seniors figured that the Sandburg site 
would supplement the Woodbridge facility and that a third senior center might 
one day be built in the Northwood area. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's elderly population is growing rapidly and could exceed 50,000 within 
the next few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to rent out portions of the Sandburg site came in January as the 
city staff searched for ways to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they will not decide until they measure the effect of the 
new center on the attendance at the Sandburg facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (Sandburg) center is not being utilized, then we need to do something 
about that," Councilman Barry J. Hammond said. "But at this point, it's 
premature to discuss. We need to see what happens when the new center opens." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Christina L. Shea said that if seniors stop attending the 
Sandburg facility, the city could rent out portions of it or actually sell the 
entire property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is the city doesn't have any money," Shea said. "Everyone has to do 
their part to help out." SHELBY GRAD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; CREWS TOIL TO CLEAN UP OIL SPREAD BY 
RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cleanup crews trudged two miles down a mucky dirt road Sunday, dodging 
rattlesnakes and hauling 25 pounds of equipment apiece, before they began the 
grubby, painstaking work of mopping up oil. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the obstacles, nearly two dozen workers labored from dawn to dusk, 
scouring the Santa Paula backcountry for every last wisp of an estimated 30,000 
gallons that leaked two weeks ago from a Unocal tank into the Adams Canyon 
Barranca. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all hoof and huff and mopping up everything that's around," worker 
Howard Paxton said during a lunch break taken just yards from a pile of 
oil-coated debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill occurred when a storage tank containing light crude and oil 
overflowed into the barranca. Recent seismic activity prompted a surge in the 
oil that seeps from century-old tunnels in Adams Canyon, overwhelming the small 
tank, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of the leak, Unocal officials said they immediately sent out cleanup 
crews, who almost scrubbed the barranca clean in eight days of intensive work. 
Then the rains hit over the weekend, flushing the lingering light crude down 
the swollen barranca and into the Santa Clara River, which flows straight to 
the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated and weary, the crews had to fan out again Saturday and Sunday, 
hiking along the barranca and river to sweep up the remains of a spill they 
thought that they had contained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had put in a lot of hours of manpower and had it almost all done until the 
rains came and washed the rest of the oil all over the place," Unocal utility 
worker Mike Burns said. "Mother Nature just said, 'Hey, I'm bigger than you 
guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After several hours in the trenches, Burns pronounced the barranca mostly 
clean Sunday afternoon, although he acknowledged that it could take days, or 
weeks, to remove every speck of crude. 
</P>
<P>
 A few clots of oil might have floated into the Pacific, he said, and some 
pools along the way still shimmered with oil's trademark rainbow sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, Burns said his crews had contained the contaminant. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as always with oil spills, workers said the last few gallons would 
prove the toughest to capture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might be here for four days or four weeks until we pass inspection," said 
Joaquin Lopez, a cleanup worker with Lindsey Grading & Excavation in Santa 
Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all clean, but then the rain messed things up and now we've found some 
spots that are ugly." STEPHANIE SIMON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; CITY OFFERS GRANTS TO NONPROFIT SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nonprofit groups that provide services to local residents can apply for grants 
from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are available for the 1993-94 grant program and must be returned 
by April 1 to City Hall, 33282 Golden Lantern, Suite 203. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say priority will be given to funding requests under the 
following criteria: 
</P>
<P>
 * Local nonprofit groups with active programs have the highest priority. 
</P>
<P>
 * Projects or services that fill needs within Dana Point that are not 
currently being served. 
</P>
<P>
 * Programs that target local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Projects that spend a minimum amount on administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Willingness of groups to share information about the program with the 
general public and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials stress that the money should be spent providing the service 
rather than paying office expenses, administrative salaries or other operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The applications should give specific information about how the funding would 
be spent, who the grant would benefit and where people live who would be served 
by the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the city grant program, call Shelley Velez at (714)

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; YOUTHFUL DJS OUTDO OLD GUYS OF 22 OR 23 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Nick Green and David Bailey go to high school dances, they're not there 
to meet girls or hang out with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 They're all business. 
</P>
<P>
 Green and Bailey, both 17, recently started their own disc-jockey business 
called Conquest Enterprises, which has been lining up gigs at high school 
dances throughout South County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just seen what other DJ's do and these kids are unhappy with that," 
Green said. "These guys are 23 or 22 and they don't know what the kids want." 
</P>
<P>
 Green, a senior, and Bailey, a junior at Dana Hills High School, pooled money 
they saved from Bar Mitzvahs, birthdays and part-time jobs to buy the $12,000 
in record and compact disc players, speakers, lights and the fog machine they 
bring to their shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I was saving for a car," Green said. "Then when I saw this 
business opportunity, I decided to invest it in Conquest. . . . Everything is 
bought and paid for." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go into it full-force," added Bailey, who is Dana Hills' top 
varsity tennis player and maintains a 4.0 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The two also appear to be savvy businessmen, knowing how to market their 
product and keep their customers happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of a scheduling system for seniors that gets him out of class 
by late morning, Green uses his free time to meet with activity directors at 
surrounding high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He also showcases the business by playing free promotional shows during lunch 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do everything in person," Green said. "We leave them a business card and a 
flyer." 
</P>
<P>
 They also have worked with friends on a promotional video that they plan to 
show to prospective clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Green and Bailey said they built about half of their company's music 
collection by requesting promotional copies from area record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We offer free marketing for (the stores)," Green said. "We're targeting the 
market area they're interested in reaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Thurlow, Mission Viejo High School's activities director, said he was 
impressed with the two young businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Conquest Enterprises recently played at the school and got a good response for 
the quality of its show and its music selection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But more important," Thurlow said, "these guys are very courteous and very 
prompt, and they were very professional. I was very impressed with how these 
young entrepreneurs conducted themselves and their business." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Green and Bailey say they have built the company entirely on their 
own, they did rely on family ties recently for one of their biggest promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Bailey's father is a friend of Donald T. Sterling, owner of the Los 
Angeles Clippers professional basketball team, they were able to get free game 
tickets that they gave away at the Mission Viejo High dance. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dance comes, Green said, he doesn't stay on the sidelines. A lover of 
dancing, he goes out on the floor to mingle with the other teens and find out 
what they like and dislike about the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I'm out there," he said, sounding more like a businessman than a 
dancer, "I have to do some of the marketing." RICHARD CORE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY MULLS PLAN TO REDRAW BOUNDARIES

<P>
 The Ventura City Council today will consider a plan that would help fast-track 
a proposed development of 330 townhouses in western Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would stretch the downtown boundaries significantly to include the 
Ventura Avenue area.The boundaries would move more than 20 blocks north of West 
Park Row Avenue to Delaware Drive, which would include the upper Avenue 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the council members say they like the idea of allowing townhouses in 
the Avenue, but are worried that the proposal would draw away housing 
allocations for downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, developers in the upper Avenue area would be allowed to 
immediately apply for and receive housing units. Other developers outside the 
downtown and Avenue areas must wait until next month to apply and compete 
against each other for limited allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, by the Neel and Huntsinger families of Ventura, would include 
housing and an office development north of Stanley Avenue and west of Ventura 
Avenue. PEGGY Y. LEE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; VIETNAM CHILDREN GET HELP FOR HEARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Vietnam, hospitals aren't able to provide enough specialized, expensive 
treatment for the many children who need open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 But with help from ProMedica International of Newport Beach, some financial 
supporters living in Orange County and a French-run medical institute in the 
Asian country, some of the children are getting the attention they need. 
</P>
<P>
 Judie Vivian, chief executive at ProMedica, a medical service company that 
helps sustain the 2-year-old Vietnam Heart Institute in Ho Chi Minh City 
(formerly Saigon), said that so far about 1,500 children have received 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-bed clinic was started in 1990 by two French cardiologists, Alain 
Carpentier and Alain Deloche, and sits on an abandoned football field at a 
military camp. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two operating rooms equipped for an average of four open-heart 
surgeries a day as well as pre- and postoperative care. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian, a mechanical engineer who once designed artificial heart valves, said 
that Vietnamese health care has resources to deal only with common ailments, 
not expensive, complicated procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, thousands of Vietnamese children who are born with defective 
hearts or acquire a rheumatic disease go untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 While French and Vietnamese physicians practice medicine at the institute, 
Vivian and her company head the effort in the United States to attract donors 
to pay for surgery for the many indigent children who arrive at the institute 
desperately needing help. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam earlier 
this year has opened new opportunities for the heart institute and ProMedica. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the embargo, we tried to keep a low profile," Vivian said, adding that 
many in the Vietnamese community here are critical of businesses that operate 
in Vietnam under the Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics has become very tricky. But we are completely autonomous from the 
government. And we target children." 
</P>
<P>
 ProMedica wants to expand its foothold in Southeast Asia and plans a 
teleconference in which Asian doctors can watch open-heart surgery performed on 
patients at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian hopes the effort will help doctors from neighboring countries to learn 
heart surgery techniques and the more basic things like proper sterilization 
and hospital hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Nguyen, who works at Baxter Healthcare in Irvine, is a sponsor who has 
donated more than $1,000 to the heart institute. 
</P>
<P>
 With donations from Nguyen and a pool of Baxter employees, an 18-month-old 
Vietnamese child who was born with a heart problem recently underwent 
corrective heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing fine," Nguyen said proudly, adding: "I do it because I am from 
that country and am grateful to be able to help people who need the help." BOB 
ELSTON

TWO SANTA ANA SHOOTING VICTIMS IDENTIFIED BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man shot following a three-block car chase was in critical condition Sunday 
while the suspected gang members who attacked his car and killed another man 
over the weekend remained at large, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez, 26, of South Cypress Street was wounded, police said, and 
Thomas Rodriguez, 17, who lived on East Buffalo Street, was slain. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police said the incident started about 7:40 p.m. Saturday with a 
dispute between the passengers of two cars that were playing a deadly game of 
cat and mouse.  
</P>
<P>
 Occupants in the car giving chase fired at least 12 shots, some while the cars 
were still racing along city streets, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 During the chase, a third car was hit at Orange Avenue and Bishop Street, 
slightly injuring two bystanders, police said. But the chase continued for 
several blocks until the victims' car crashed onto the lawn of a home on the 
600 block of South Cypress Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said passengers from the other car started firing at the crashed 
vehicle, fatally shooting one man in the head.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, the second man in the crashed car, was shot several times in the 
back or side and was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, Sgt. Don 
Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said investigators believe that gang members were involved in the 
attack, but no information was released on suspects in the case. "No arrests 
have been made," Robertson added.

9 ARRESTED IN LAGUNA SOBRIETY SWEEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine people were arrested on suspicion of drunk driving at a checkpoint set up 
over the weekend on Laguna Canyon Road, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach police, working with the California Highway Patrol, conducted the 
checkpoint at the 30000 block of Laguna Canyon Road between 10 p.m. Saturday 
and 2:30 a.m. Sunday, stopping more than 800 of the 1,300 vehicles that passed 
through during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Police conducted field sobriety tests on 39 drivers whom they suspected may 
have been drinking. Police said nine people flunked the test and were taken 
into custody and later released on misdemeanor charges of driving under the 
influence. Three people were also cited for open-container violations, and two 
were charged with marijuana possession, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach police generally set up the drunk-driving checkpoints about once 
a month at various spots around the city.

MIKE DOWNEY: COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; DEFINITELY KNOWING A 
SCUFFLE 
</P>

<P>
 The fight began with 3:23 remaining before halftime. You might have missed it 
when the quake coverage pre-empted the Arkansas-Georgetown basketball coverage. 
Anyway, until the melee, it had been a close and excellent contest, with 
Arkansas ahead on the judges' cards by a point. After that, well, it was not 
much of a contest at all. 
</P>
<P>
 A nasty little altercation interrupted Sunday's NCAA Midwest Regional 
nightcap, with players from both sides being ejected for leaving the bench to 
participate. Tournament favorite Arkansas eventually won, 85-73, overcoming its 
loss of a valuable player a lot more easily than Georgetown did. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the blow-by-blow: 
</P>
<P>
 With Arkansas ahead, 34-33, frisky Georgetown forward Robert Churchwell, a 
6-foot-6 senior from South Bend, Ind., who apparently is familiar with good 
tackling, wrapped his arms around 6-4 guard Clint McDaniel of the Razorbacks in 
the lane, 10 feet from the basket, bearhugging him all the way to the paint. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel didn't care for this much. First, whipping his left elbow behind him 
toward Churchwell's steeple, then rising and aiming a swift kick that nearly 
caught the Georgetown player right in the Hoyas, McDaniel prompted what is 
commonly known in other sports as a bench-clearing brawl. Among those clearing 
said bench were 6-8 junior Don Reid from Georgetown and 6-6 sophomore Scotty 
Thurman from Arkansas, although they were hardly the only ones. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the ones punished, though. Reid and Thurman, both starters, were 
banished to the dressing room by officials Tim Higgins and Dick Paparo. Instant 
replay -- CBS showed it at least eight times -- revealed that McDaniel clearly 
over-reacted to his opponent's action, but Paparo said he and Higgins never 
needed a replay, putting it this way: "We felt we had definite knowledge in the 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel was slapped with a technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. Yet he 
and Churchwell were permitted to remain in the game. And in choosing which of 
the many players who left the bench would be ejected, Higgins said, "We had 
definite knowledge of the two players we could pick up who came on the floor," 
definite knowledge becoming a key factor in this game. 
</P>
<P>
 What Georgetown Coach John Thompson definitely knew was that while both he and 
counterpart Nolan Richardson had lost important players, the Arkansas coach 
could afford to more. Or, as TV analyst Greg Kelser vividly observed: "Losing 
Thurman hurt Arkansas a little, but losing Reid left Georgetown naked." 
</P>
<P>
 An entire NCAA game, and Georgetown's season, could have turned on this one 
incident. Arkansas immediately took charge of the game and Georgetown seemed to 
lose its defensive edge and its focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was angrier, though, at the outcry from TV sportscasters -- one in 
particular, considerably shorter than Kelser -- who called for much stronger 
action against the players. Thompson said: "It's easy for (a naughty word) to 
sit up there in their Eiffel (sic) Towers and say which players should get 
kicked out of games. Billy (Packer) should know better. He played the game 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 His Hoya players put the blame more on the Razorbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised by their tactics," guard Joey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Churchwell, in some ways the instigator, said: "There was nothing to it. It 
was an intense point of the game and emotions were flying high. There was no 
reason for anybody to be tossed. It was just high emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 It can cost you a game, high emotion. We have definite knowledge of this. 
</P>
<P>
 In other definite knowledge: 
</P>
<P>
 Making Clint's Day: This Clint McDaniel who swung an elbow at a Georgetown 
player, then gave him a vicious kick? At the University of Arkansas, McDaniel 
majors in criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah? So Did Bruce Lee: Speaking of McDaniel prior to this tournament, 
Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson observed: "He has especially quick hands and 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Smith Goes On: Tulsa's next tournament trip has become Tubby Does Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention, Conventions: A reminder that Mr. Dean Smith, Mr. John Thompson, Mr. 
Eddie Sutton and Mr. Rick Pitino are now available for speaking engagements at 
popular prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Better Redhead Than Deadhead: Giving credit where credit is due, let it be 
said that Bill Walton stuck his neck out in criticizing UCLA, took some heat 
for criticizing UCLA and turned out to be totally accurate in criticizing UCLA. 
Off the wall. Right on target. Nothing but net. 
</P>
<P>
 One Million Years, B.C.: Boston College lost to Northwestern in football, but 
defeated North Carolina in basketball. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what is 
known in collegiate athletics as a full year. 
</P>
<P>
 That Guy! Missouri is coming to the West Regional in Los Angeles with a player 
whose name is Marlo Thomas Finner. 
</P>
<P>
 George Reeves Flew Solo: Oh, how America would have loved the further 
adventures of Bryant "Big Country" Reeves, the 7-footer from Oklahoma State 
whose team was eliminated. Big Country hails from Gans, Okla., population 218. 
When his college coach told him not to be nervous about a preseason tournament 
in New York in 1991, Big Country said: "Coach, I'm not worried about the game. 
I'm worried because I ain't never been on no airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Holding Pattern: After that flight, teammate Scott Sutton made up this 
story about Big Country: "He heard gum would help unclog your ears. So he asked 
me for a stick. Twenty minutes later, I'm asleep and Country wakes me up and 
asks for a stick of gum. I said, 'Country, I already gave you some gum." And 
Country said, 'Yeah, but now I need one to plug up the other ear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Attention, Idiots: Westbound for our L.A. regional, maybe Louisville Coach 
Denny Crum can explain to us again why anybody who criticizes UCLA is "idiotic" 
and knows nothing about basketball. Duh. 
</P>
<P>
 Gopher Day: Minnesota is not coming to our West Regional after all. Too bad. I 
had made Minnesota a two-point favorite over Arizona, a five-point favorite 
over the Missouri-Syracuse winner and a 50- point favorite in case it got 
another shot at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 March Seismic Madness: The regional at the Sports Arena could be the first in 
NCAA history where fans request seats under a doorway.

THEIR SILENCE HONORS A GOLDEN MOMENT; REACTION: THOSE CLOSEST TO GRETZKY SHARE 
THE CROWD'S AWE AFTER HIS RECORD-TYING GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On the ice at San Jose Arena, there was a wild celebration. But in the special 
box containing the Gretzky family, there was only silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned silence. 
</P>
<P>
 For a couple of seconds, there was no visible reaction to Wayne Gretzky's 
801st career goal, tying Gordie Howe's all-time NHL mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all froze," said Mike Barnett, Gretzky's agent. "We realized we were 
witnessing history. It was like time stood still in the arena." 
</P>
<P>
 There was time for Walter Gretzky, who suffered a brain aneurysm 2 1/2 years 
ago, to enjoy having recovered enough to view in person one of the crowning 
achievements of his son's brilliant career. 
</P>
<P>
 There was time for Phyllis Gretzky to smile at the accuracy of her prediction. 
She had announced Sunday morning that her son would get two goals later that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what prompted her to make that prediction, Phyllis, who has been 
traveling with the Kings, said, "I want to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 There was time for Janet Gretzky to marvel at seeing her husband tie a record 
she didn't even know existed when she started dating him. The St. Louis native 
had never even heard of Gordie Howe when she met Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was time for Barnett to recall when he had first seen Gretzky play 
as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "You knew right then," Barnett said, "that something special was happening." 
</P>
<P>
 After the initial silence in the box, the family all began yelling, "He did 
it! 801! He did it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, as he had done in Edmonton when he had broken Howe's career mark 
for points, Gretzky reached a milestone at a crucial point in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Edmonton, Gretzky set the points record with a goal that sent the game into 
overtime, then won it in the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Gretzky scored his record-tying goal with 49 seconds to play to enable 
the Kings to tie the San Jose Sharks, 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he have any idea how he is able to rise to such occasions? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, but I love it," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why he is what he is," King owner Bruce McNall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the very reason he belongs in Los Angeles," Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne always seems to bring out the drama and make it exciting," Janet said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way Sunday afternoon could have been any better would have been if 
Howe himself had been there to share in the joy. 
</P>
<P>
 He has stayed away from Gretzky's record-breaking tour, maintaining that 801 
is not the true record total, insisting that the goals Howe scored in the old 
World Hockey Assn. should also count, boosting the career mark to 975. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gordie and Colleen (his wife) feel the excitement," said Janet, who has 
spoken to the couple several times recently. "It's been a little bit of a 
travel situation for them. They have their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Might the Howes now change their travel plans and head west in time for the 
Kings' next game, Wednesday night at the Forum against the Vancouver Canucks? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think," Janet said with a smile, "that might be a good time for them to 
come." Especially if Phyllis Gretzky is to be believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked when her son would score No. 802, she said: "He'll definitely do it 
Wednesday."

FORMER EDISON STAR JESSIE IS READY TO TAKE OFF; BASKETBALL: HE STRUGGLED EARLY 
BUT SOME KEY ADVICE LED TO A PRODUCTIVE TERM AT VENTURA COLLEGE. HE IS READY TO 
MOVE UP TO A BIGGER PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Stretched face down on the hardwood floor, perspiration pouring from his body 
and his hands covering his eyes, Brandon Jessie heard the celebration nearby 
but couldn't bear to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to end like that. 
</P>
<P>
 All the laughter and hugs and yelling in that torrent of humanity at the other 
end of the court was supposed to be done by Jessie and his Ventura College 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the script didn't work out. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't believe what had happened," Jessie said. "We were the No. 1 
team but we didn't get to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates entered the title game Saturday at UC Irvine poised to claim the 
State community college championship, but Long Beach City College ruined those 
designs with a 63-61 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura endured a similar fate the previous season in the final at the 
University of San Francisco. Ranked No. 1, the Pirates returned home with the 
bitter taste of a 97-88 upset defeat to Columbia College and the resolve to 
take care of business this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, another team gave them the business. Ventura weaved 37-2 and 36-3 
records the past two seasons, had winning streaks of 21 and 29 games, but fell 
short both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jessie, the heart and soul of the top-ranked team in the state since the 
preseason, was crushed. He lay motionless on the floor of the Bren Events 
Center for a few seconds until Coach Philip Mathews asked him to join the other 
Pirates on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie trudged to the sideline, threw a towel over his head and sat quietly, 
his marvelous two-season career at Ventura ended in despair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A week has passed since that loss, but the heartache is still visible. It 
probably will be for a long while. 
</P>
<P>
 To Jessie, a 6-foot-5 forward with remarkable quickness and jumping ability, 
winning the State championship was the ultimate payoff for those months of hard 
practices and tough games. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived at Ventura two summers ago with unquestionable credentials as a 
player but a notorious reputation for wanting to do things his way, on and off 
the court. Part of that came from his great success as a basketball, football 
and track star at Edison High.  
</P>
<P>
 As a three-year varsity starter for the Chargers, Jessie set school records 
for points (1,580) and rebounds (818) and twice was named the most valuable 
player in the Sunset League. He also was an outstanding wide receiver and 
league sprint champion in track. His schoolwork and attitude, however, needed 
some adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admit I was crazy," Jessie said. "I did a lot of stupid things. . . . I 
started getting into fights at parties, my grades suffered." 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Ron, the former Ram All-Pro wide receiver, heard about the Ventura 
basketball program. He learned that Mathews stressed academics, so he prodded 
his son to visit the school. Jessie was sold immediately but soon realized he 
had walked into a land mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in at over 240 pounds (he weighs around 215 now) and I was way out of 
shape," Jessie said. "Every day in conditioning he (Mathews) would be running 
next to me, yelling in my ear, calling me fat and lazy. After my first day, I 
called my mom and told her I wanted to come home. I said, 'He is killing me.' 
My dad got on the phone and said to stick it out, that I had made a 
commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 The advice paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992-93 season, Jessie averaged 16.5 points and 9.3 rebounds in the 
regular season, and was named to the All-Western State Conference North 
Division first team after helping the Pirates to their seventh consecutive 
divisional title. He led the team in scoring with 78 points and rebounds with 
34 in three games at the State championships, and was selected to the 
all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mathews, who says he rode his prized player in order to tap into Jessie's 
vast potential, the results confirmed that he had Jessie headed in the right 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brandon came in with the reputation that he played any which way he wanted," 
Mathews said. "We decided he was going to play the VC way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under Mathews, who guided the Pirates to the State title in 1987 and to the 
final eight the past three seasons, the VC way of playing basketball means 
all-out, intense, baseline-to-baseline action for 40 minutes. Loafers need not 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
 No one perhaps exemplified that approach like Jessie, a tireless worker who 
seldom gave up on a loose ball or a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kid can really play," Mathews said. "He has immense talent. On raw 
talent, he is probably the best we've had. I put him in a class with (Cedric) 
Ceballos (of the Phoenix Suns). . . . He could be in the league (NBA) if he 
wants to." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Jessie seemed as if he belonged in another league this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He blossomed into a force who led the team in practically every category and 
took the Pirates to another WSC North title. Jessie averaged 22.9 points, 10.9 
rebounds, made 51.6% of his shots and 74.8% of his free throws, and had a 
team-high 70 steals. The division coaches named Jessie and teammate Joey 
Ramirez co-most valuable players, and their counterparts around California 
voted Jessie the state's co-player of the year with Columbia's Jamie Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
 During the State championships last week, Jessie scored a tournament-high 78 
points, had 23 rebounds in three games and was named to the all-tournament 
team. But the trophy that got away, the one presented to the winning team, is 
what Jessie wanted most. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we go through here from August to March, the conditioning, the practices 
-- it's brutal," Jessie said. "I mean, to work hard like that and get to the 
finals and lose it. The first year was unbelievable. The second year was 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy-five percent of it was the loss of the game but the other 25% was 
knowing that I wouldn't be playing anymore with Joey or D'Mitri (Rideout) or 
Michael (Tate) or Alfred (Kennedy). We did everything together for two years. I 
told the guys and the coaches after the game that it was the best two years of 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 That old gang of theirs will be elsewhere next season, playing for other 
coaches and with new teammates, perhaps in faraway places. Jessie has been 
courted by virtually every major four-year school in the country but still 
doesn't know which he will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 He considered an offer to play football and basketball at Florida State, but 
says he hasn't heard from Seminole officials lately. However, he did hear from 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has crossed my mind (playing football and basketball) so many times," 
Jessie said. "My dad said it would be hard. He said to save my bones now and 
stick to basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 That must be sweet music to recruiters from Duke and UCLA and Georgetown and 
other Division I schools jockeying for position to persuade Jessie to join 
their program. A sociology major, Jessie has the grades to attend the 
university of his choice but he apparently has narrowed the front-runners to a 
precious few. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at so much stuff (when selecting a school)," Jessie said. 
"Who is leaving (the team)? Who is coming in? Will you get playing time? Every 
decision would be good. You just have to make the best one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been talking to Duke a lot. I've been talking to (center) Cherokee 
(Parks, another former Orange County high school product) and he thinks I can 
come in and definitely play. I also would like to stay close to home and UCLA 
would be good for me because of that. That's what's going to get me, right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jessie said he will visit five campuses in the next few weeks before 
deciding. He said his two seasons at Ventura were a solid foundation for what's 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up a lot here," he said. "The discipline I learned here will stick 
with me for the rest of my life. I think Coach (Mathews) has prepared me very 
well. He got me mentally ready for anything I'm going to face at a higher 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made it through two years of hell with Phil Mathews, but it was worth it."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; AFTER LONG NIGHT, STRAWBERRY DELIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry spent about 12 hours getting from the Orlando airport to 
Vero Beach after the limousine he hired broke down on a dark, two-lane Florida 
highway Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't about to get out of the car and walk down that dark road," 
Strawberry said. "So we just slept there, but you don't really sleep, you 
know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry arrived in Orlando about 9 p.m. Saturday after spending Friday 
night in Los Angeles with his wife, Charisse, and their new baby, Jordan Shay, 
who was born Thursday. Strawberry said that midway to Vero Beach, which is a 
90-minute drive from the airport, the limo's engine overheated because the 
driver had forgotten to put oil in it.  
</P>
<P>
 "The driver said to me, 'We are a long way from anywhere,' " Strawberry said. 
"And I told him, 'Let's just sit here and wait.' He didn't have a phone in the 
car. So about 7:30 this morning (Sunday), a policeman came by, and he called a 
tow truck for us." 
</P>
<P>
 A tired Strawberry arrived at Dodgertown at about 10 a.m., in time to play in 
a 7-6 loss to the New York Mets, and had his best game of the spring. He lined 
a fastball from Bret Saberhagen to center field in the second inning for a 
single, stole second base and later scored. In the fourth, he robbed Luis 
Rivera of a home run with a catch over the fence. And in the eighth inning, 
Strawberry hit his second home run of the spring, a solo shot over the 
right-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times in the past two years I had doubts about getting to this 
point," said Strawberry, who had permission to stay longer in Los Angeles, but 
wanted to get back for Sunday's game. "I couldn't steal bases before and I 
certainly couldn't hit a good fastball from Saberhagen. . . . That was 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Gross made his first start of the spring and pitched four scoreless 
innings, giving up four hits and three walks. He says he will be ready when the 
season starts. . . . For the second consecutive game, Billy Ashley came off the 
bench and hit a two-run homer. . . . Cory Snyder has inflammation in his lower 
back, but no herniation. He will stay in Los Angeles this week for treatment. . 
. . Chan Ho Park will make his fourth start today, against the Montreal Expos. 
. . . Greg Hansell, Omar Daal and John DeSilva were optioned to triple-A 
Albuquerque. . . . Delino DeShields says he no longer needs his protective 
mask, but he has been blanked at the plate the last couple of games. "I'm doing 
everything the same," he said. "I just think I may be trying too hard trying to 
show everyone I can play." . . . Left-handed pitcher Mike Milchin will have 
surgery on his left elbow this month. MARYANN HUDSON

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; YOUNG FIGHTERS READY TO STEP IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are overshadowed on undercards, fight at fairgrounds for meager purses, 
and watch as the television networks gobble up the rights to every 40-something 
fighter still able to wobble toward the middle of a ring. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Olympic Auditorium joins the Forum as one of Los Angeles' major 
boxing venues, young area fighters such as Shane Mosley and Robert Garcia 
appear to be ready for major recognition exactly when the demand is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya and the Ruelas brothers, Rafael and Gabriel, are also young 
and talented and figure to dominate the local scene for years. But they have 
already received more exposure than Mosley, Garcia, Carlos Hernandez and Juan 
Lazcano can dream of -- and De La Hoya and the Ruelas are being considered as 
Las Vegas headliners, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 So besides the Mexican fighters the Forum features regularly, who will 
headline the 40 to 50 shows a year scheduled at the Olympic and Forum? 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all great young fighters, all coming up at the same time," said 
veteran trainer Art Miles, who is working with Lazcano, an 18-year-old junior 
lightweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick look at four of the local fighters mostly likely to succeed: 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Mosley -- He more than held his own in the amateurs with De La Hoya and 
the Ruelas brothers, and great things have been expected from him ever since. 
But while De La Hoya has won a gold medal and earned more than $2 million, 
Gabriel Ruelas is a No. 1 contender and Rafael Ruelas has an International 
Boxing Federation title, Mosley, 21, has been quietly biding his time. 
</P>
<P>
 It might take an impressive victory in his scheduled 10-rounder with Oscar 
Lopez Saturday at the Fairplex in Pomona for Mosley to emerge as a legitimate 
lightweight title contender. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mosley, he's definitely the best prospect," said De La Hoya's trainer, Robert 
Alcazar. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a homecoming fight for Mosley, who is from Pomona and has won all nine of 
his pro fights on knockouts. But Lopez is easily the toughest opponent he will 
have faced. Lopez, also 21, is 20-6, but has faced a slew of top-10 lightweight 
contenders and is known for his Hector Camacho-like agility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've taken my time a little bit," Mosley said. "I think it's time for me to 
fight somebody people recognize -- like Oscar Lopez. I know this is a step up 
in class for me, but I feel I can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley, who is trained by his father, Jack, had been sparring with Zachary 
Padilla, the World Boxing Organization's junior-welterweight champion, before 
Padilla's bout March 12 at the Olympic. 
</P>
<P>
 There are tentative plans to get Mosley a date at the Olympic sometime this 
spring, and perhaps a spot on George Foreman's undercard this summer. But 
first, he must beat Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Garcia -- The Oxnard native is establishing himself as one of the 
bigger hitters in the featherweight division with nine knockouts in 11 fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, 19, part of the De La Hoya-Alcazar stable, won a six-round decision 
March 12 at the Olympic on Padilla's undercard, and is scheduled to be on 
Gabriel Ruelas' undercard April 16 at the Olympic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, he's a puncher," said Alcazar, who doesn't like to compare Garcia 
to De La Hoya, but says he expects Garcia to fight for a title before the end 
of 1995. "I want him to use the ring, learn how to box. Because he's got the 
power, everybody knows that already. He's just 19, but he's got 11 fights, 
almost as much as Oscar." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Hernandez -- Hernandez's pro debut ended in a draw, but he has won 14 
in a row since.  
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 23, a 5-foot-6 junior-lightweight based in Bellflower, headlines 
Thursday's Irvine Marriott show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see much missing in him except experience," veteran trainer Jackie 
McCoy said. "He has a good chin. He's very strong, he's very quick. I think he 
gets another five or six fights under his belt, he can fight anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Lazcano -- He could have waited and been a candidate for the U.S. team in 
the 1996 Olympics, but Miles says, "Why wait that long?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lazcano, originally from El Paso but now based in Los Angeles, is a 
straight-ahead fighter in the Julio Cesar Chavez mold. He already is 6-0 and is 
scheduled for a four-rounder on the Mosley-Lopez undercard Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to knock out De La Hoya in the Olympic Auditorium in December of this 
year," Miles said. "We'd like to fight (World Boxing Council 
junior-welterweight champion) Frankie Randall in El Paso probably by next June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll stop De La Hoya in three rounds. He's got no defense . . . 
nobody has ever backed him up. Lazcano will back him up. He's a true Mexican 
gladiator." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lazcano: "My time is about to come."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; VETERAN TANANA IS GIVEN RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Tanana poured himself a cup of coffee, put his right arm around 
92-year-old Jimmie Reese, and momentarily wondered if he was going to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun being with Jimmie," Tanana said. "You know I'll always love you." 
Reese, coach with the Angels the first time Tanana was here, said: "Me too, 
Frank, me too." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana, 40, was given his unconditional release, perhaps ending his 20-year 
career as a starting pitcher. He will head back to Farmington Hills, Mich., 
with his family today, and wait for the phone to ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a shock, but it's like a rejection," Tanana said. "It's not a good 
feeling. This is unusual for me. I've never been in this situation. I've always 
seen guys get released, but I never got released before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess if you hang around long enough, you're going to see everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana, who was 0-3 with a 13.50 earned-run average this spring, still 
believes that he can help a contending team. He won't quit the game, he said, 
until baseball gives up on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Buck Rodgers: "It's never easy to tell a 40-year-old man 
his career is over. I thought it was a longshot, anyway. It was just like 
(Dave) Winfield. How long do you go with a guy who's 40 years old?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Angels, no longer even camouflaging their intentions of trading first 
baseman J.T. Snow, played him in left field Sunday during a 7-0 split-squad 
loss to the Colorado Rockies at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Several club have expressed interest in Snow since word got out that he is on 
the trading block. At least two National League teams have called in the last 
few days. The Angels were told Sunday that New York Met starter Anthony Young, 
who is being offered in exchange for Snow, will pitch Wednesday against 
Atlanta. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; JORDAN EXPECTED TO BE CUT TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jordan, expected to be cut today, got his third spring hit and a small 
scare when a woman jumped from the stands to hug him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan did not start Sunday's exhibition game between the Chicago White Sox 
and Florida Marlins, but was a defensive replacement in the sixth inning.One of 
his many fans among the 33,263 at Joe Robbie Stadium leaped from the right 
field bleacher seats, ran to Jordan and hugged him. The woman then left on her 
own, climbing over a side wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scared me," Jordan said. "I told her, 'You'd better get back before you 
get arrested.' She asked me, 'How do I get back out?' and I told her, 'The same 
way you got in.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't mean to hurt me. She just wanted to say hello." 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, Jordan hit a chopper to third baseman Jerry Browne. Browne 
tried to backhand the ball, but couldn't and Jordan was generously credited 
with a hit.

NFL MEETINGS; REALIGNMENT SPARKS OWNER UNREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A funny thing happened on the eve of what the NFL is touting as its most 
peaceful owners' meetings in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners bickered. And bickered. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind potted plants, underneath man-made waterfalls, in various corners of a 
resort hotel here, discussions began on a topic that has suddenly become hot 
and heavy: 
</P>
<P>
 Realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 And the owners thought figuring out expansion was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 82nd Airborne couldn't get this league realigned," said Art Modell, owner 
of the Cleveland Browns. "The last time we realigned (1970), it took so long, 
two of my suits went out of style." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for realignment is the inclusion of the two expansion teams for 
1995, the Charlotte Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for problems is that the existing teams that should move do not 
want to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the ones who want to move, there is no place for them to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geography doesn't matter, because if it did, we wouldn't have played this 
long in the current divisions," said George Young, New York Giant general 
manager. "This is about tradition, about identification." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the league wants the Arizona Cardinals to move to the NFC West, 
therefore opening up a spot in the NFC East for Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 But that one dissenter is Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials claim they have experienced enough turmoil for one off-season 
after hiring Coach Buddy Ryan and then changing their name from "Phoenix." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have established good rivalries in the East, and we want to keep those," 
said Bill Bidwill, the Cardinal owner who cashes his biggest checks after the 
Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants have come to town. 
</P>
<P>
 In the AFC, where the larger-market Panthers will be placed for television 
purposes, the East Division could have a vacancy if Indianapolis moves to the 
Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Colts want. . . . "I feel sure we will move, and the Central 
Division would make sense," said Jim Irsay, the team's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 But they would not be welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would we want to do that?" asked Dan Rooney, Pittsburgh Steeler 
president. "We don't need them in our division." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the problems with the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints. 
Both teams want to leave the NFC West, but until a new Gulf Coast division is 
created, there is no place for them to go. 
</P>
<P>
 If the realignment committee cannot make a decision by May, Paul Tagliabue, 
NFL commissioner, has been given the power to insert the two new teams into the 
current divisions with vacancies -- Charlotte to the AFC Central, Jacksonville 
to the NFC West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's what is going to happen," Rooney said. "We gave the league an 
out, and they are going to take it. We'll never get the majority to agree on 
any of these plans."

CORONA DEL MAR SWIMMERS SECURE WITHOUT CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His reasoning applies in every back yard but his own. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mike Starkweather, the Corona del Mar boys' swim coach, said pulling high 
school swimmers out of club teams would change the entire chemistry of high 
school swimming, he forgot to exclude present company. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Corona del Mar has no club-affiliated swimmers, the Sea Kings would be 
affected only by how much they would gain from such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no club swimmers, not one," Starkweather said with a shrug. "Maybe 
once or twice since I've been here, we've had one that swam for Novas, but 
overall, it's all us. That's unique for Orange County. They all swim for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost unheard of for a top program not to have at least one or two star 
club names to add some high octane kick to a high school team's roster. 
Nationally ranked Woodbridge and Mission Viejo draw heavily from the 
Irvine-based Novaquatics and Mission Viejo Nadadores. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of Corona del Mar's almost comic inexperience in highly 
competitive swimming surfaced at last year's Southern Section Division I meet. 
Senior Crosby Grant, known more for his water polo prowess, qualified in the 
200-yard freestyle and 100-yard backstroke and was the last swimmer to qualify 
for the consolation finals in the 200 free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the 16th guy," Grant recalled with amusement. "I was way out there in 
the outside lane." 
</P>
<P>
 Understand now, the intense competitive atmosphere of the section meet is as 
routine for club swimmers as flip turns, but Grant didn't have a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got it all wrong in the prelims," he said. "Because I have no experience, I 
tried to pace myself. So for the finals, I decided to swim as fast as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant, who will play water polo for Stanford in the fall, went out quickly. 
When he turned to breath out of the first 100, he didn't see anyone else and 
figured he was out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, "oh no, where is everyone?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind him, as it turned out. He was 15 yards ahead of the runner-up. His 
consolation victory in one minute 41.39 seconds would have given him a 
third-place finish in the championship final. 
</P>
<P>
 "My coaches were yelling and screaming, they couldn't believe it," Grant 
laughed. "The announcer kept calling me the outside smoker." 
</P>
<P>
 That Corona del Mar hasn't one clubbie on its boys' team isn't 
stop-the-presses stuff until the Sea Kings' accomplishments are considered.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings have won nine Sea View League titles in 10 years -- their 
dual-meet record since 1984 is 112-5 and they are 2-0-1 this season under 
Starkweather. It staggers the mind that they've have done it with seasonal 
swimmers, and they're proud of what they've accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a source of pride," Starkweather said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or a source of "ironic humor," as Grant explained it. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Greg Sawyer said: "It's kind of neat to do that well against schools 
with club swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has Corona del Mar managed to win, they've been successful despite 
losing some of their most talented athletes to the upper-classman plague known 
as senioritis, a malady that seems to hit water polo players harder than most 
other swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in Starkweather's tenure, all of the school's water polo 
players, a group from which the swim team has drawn heavily and relied on for 
depth, have stayed to swim during their senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, we lose about 30% to 40%," Starkweather said. "After you've built 
them up and trained them, it's really a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's water polo playing seniors -- Grant, Sawyer, Will Schulz, Steve 
Hamilton and Jason Yamamoto -- had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawyer, who has played water polo and swam all four years and will attend UC 
Santa Barbara on a water polo scholarship, spoke for many when he said they 
owed it to Starkweather to swim this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainly, it's for our coach," Sawyer said. "He's done so much for us in four 
years, we felt we owed it to him to go out. I wouldn't be here if it weren't 
for him. We made the decision last June to stick with Stark." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Yamamoto: "We're dedicated to our coach. We can't let him down. But it's 
also a way to keep other kids coming out for the sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalty to their coach isn't the only reason they're churning out the yardage 
and comparing their splits. Water polo players frequently approach swimming as 
a great way to stay in shape. Not this bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first class to take swimming seriously," Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 1993 league title and fifth-place section finish is a testament to that. 
After losing their dual meet to Woodbridge by 60 points, Corona del Mar 
rebounded to win the Sea View League championship by 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the kind of thing that makes it fun for kids," Starkweather said. They 
stayed because they've set team and individual goals for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 But would everyone have all these warm and fuzzy feelings if the team were 
wallowing in the league cellar? In fact, would they even be here? 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably not," Schulz said. "Actually, I know we wouldn't be. What would be 
the purpose?" 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, no one at Corona del Mar has had to answer that.

MIKE PENNER: ANGELS' NUMBERS ADD UP TO CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The numbers look like something out of the Southeast Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 15.6 
</P>
<P>
 13.5 
</P>
<P>
 12.3 
</P>
<P>
 12.0 
</P>
<P>
 9.8 
</P>
<P>
 9.0 
</P>
<P>
 6.8 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a pretty good little club. Balanced scoring, a couple contributors 
off the bench. If they can handle the press and tighten up the interior 
defense, you could see them going a ways. Ball bounces right, who knows, maybe 
they sneak into the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of this game, however, is baseball, not hoops, and those are ERAs up 
there, not scoring averages. The ERAs belong to John Farrell, Frank Tanana, 
Russ Springer, Hilly Hathaway, Brian Anderson, Andrew Lorraine and John Dopson 
-- candidates, erstwhile and otherwise, for the dueling black holes in the 
Angels' camp this spring, also known as the fourth and fifth spots in the 
starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 For a good three weeks now, or maybe not so good, Tempe Diablo Stadium has 
resembled NASA Space Center. A lot of launchings, a lot of unidentified flying 
objects floating around here. (Several are believed to be fastballs thrown by 
Craig Lefferts.) After a double dip of defeats Sunday -- split squads lost to 
Colorado, 7-0, and San Diego, 5-2 -- the team ERA is 8.20. 
</P>
<P>
 That's down from a pregame mark of 8.79, but still nearly three runs higher 
than Sunday's 5.3 earthquake in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi, overseeing his first major league training camp, never knew the 
Angel general manager's chair came equipped with seat belt and air bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as alarmed by our pitching today as I was at the opening of camp," Bavasi 
says. "I got here alarmed and I stayed alarmed. No difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The shelling has been relentless and the arms-for-hire are shuttled in and 
out, almost on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana checked out Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leiter, waived by Detroit last week, reports Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine, Hathaway and Farrell have been reassigned to the minor league camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Young could arrive at any minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Joe Magrane isn't scheduled to pitch any time soon, which is where 
this crisis originated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were going to come to spring training needing one guy," Angel 
Manager Buck Rodgers says. "Which isn't bad. Everybody in the world is looking 
for a fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then Magrane has surgery and suddenly, we're three deep. When you're 
looking for a fifth starter and a fourth starter -- and your third starter 
(Phil Leftwich) has 12 starts in the big leagues -- you try everybody in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the 18-5 scores and the need for "Hi, my name is . . . " ID tags doesn't 
surprise Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're trying out a bunch of people ranging in age from 40 to 22 for two 
positions, you're auditioning," Rodgers says. "You're going to get that -- 
balls hit all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if you start to panic and cut down on your experimentation -- 'We've got 
to win a game!' -- you lose the purpose of what spring training is for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tanana experiment lasted three starts, yielding an 0-3 record and a 13.50 
ERA. Tanana thought his trial was far too short, but time travels faster for a 
40-year-old junkballer on his last go-round than a manager with 60% of a 
starting rotation and 100% of a major league schedule in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew his stuff was going to be below average, but the thing that 
disappointed me about Tanana was his lack of control," Rodgers says. "A wise 
man told me once, 'With older pitchers, look for the walks.' Because when an 
older pitcher starts having trouble throwing the ball over the plate, I think 
that's the beginning of the end." 
</P>
<P>
 So now, it's come on down, Mark Leiter, let's see what you got, but you better 
make it fast. Detroit released Leiter after a mere six innings this spring, and 
Detroit isn't exactly drowning in starting pitching, but Rodgers says, "We like 
Mark Leiter off last year's reports, so why not spend a couple bucks to look at 
him and see if he's better that what we've got." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, who knows? Anthony Young's name continues to bounce off the walls 
here, the same Anthony Young who lost a record 27 consecutive games for the 
Mets, and the Angels are seriously considering trading J.T. Snow for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Pull the trigger on that deal and the Angels, in effect, will have traded Jim 
Abbott for Young, Springer and Jerry Nielsen -- three pitchers who, on the big 
league level last season combined for a 2-22 record and a 5.28 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Pull the trigger on that deal and "We will take some heat," Bavasi admits. 
"The press has mentioned it enough that we've already taken some heat . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I will tell you right now that if we make a trade for a pitcher, we will end 
up moving a player that is not too bad and probably going to get better. If we 
move a guy, it's probably going to be someone where you say, 'Ooh, gee, that 
hurts a little bit.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But if we can say, 'This makes our club better,' how can you not do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Angels can better their club by trading an everyday player for a 
pitcher who went 1-16 in 1993, well, that's about all you need to know about 
the state of the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," Tanana told reporters as he packed his bags, "I've seen what 
you guys have seen." 
</P>
<P>
 With those words, Tanana rolled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he tracking the flight of an imaginary gopher ball, like the real one Mark 
Langston served up to Phil Plantier Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 Or was he trying to get a closer view of the team ERA? 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, it's not Tanana's problem anymore. It's a shame Nolan Ryan just 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody got Andy Messersmith's home number?

TOMBA WINS TITLE WITHOUT HAVING TO RACE; SKIING: ITALIAN TAKES WORLD CUP SLALOM 
CROWN WHEN SEASON'S FINAL EVENT IS CANCELED. SWITZERLAND'S SCHNEIDER IS WOMEN'S 
WINNER. 
</P>

<P>
 The ski gods must be Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Tomba didn't make it out of the start gate Sunday. He didn't cut his 
usual slalom swath. He didn't so much as plant a pole. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alberto's magic," as he calls it, would manifest itself in the form of a 
quick-moving snow storm that forced the cancellation of the men's slalom at the 
World Cup Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision handed Tomba the World Cup slalom title as he made an important 
wine selection for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's slalom, raced as scheduled, was won by Vreni Schneider of 
Switzerland. It was Schneider's seventh slalom victory this season and her 51st 
on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's two-run time of 1 minute 35.91 was 1.51 seconds faster than the 
one turned in by Slovenia's Katja Koren. Germany's Martina Ertl, winner of 
Saturday's giant slalom, jumped from 15th to third with the fastest second-run 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the men's title was Tomba's to lose. Entering the final slalom, he 
held an 88-point lead over Austria's Thomas Stangassinger. To overtake La 
Bomba, Stangassinger needed to win the race and have Tomba either not finish or 
place 16th or worse, neither a likely scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Word had it Tomba was ready to side-step down the course if necessary to 
secure his sixth World Cup title, his third in slalom to go with three giant 
slalom crowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that it is over," Tomba said. "There has been much strain for me 
this season. But today, it was not luck. I was ahead by 88 points." 
</P>
<P>
 While Tomba would not break a sweat, it did not prevent Roberto Brunner, his 
chauffeur, from dumping a silver bowl of ice water over the champion's head in 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad finish for Tomba, considering he began the week dispelling rumors he 
was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 There were apparently no hard feelings in the opposition camp. Werner 
Margreiter, the Austrian coach, said Stangassinger had long since conceded the 
slalom title to Tomba. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Stangassinger knows the greater satisfaction of having defeated Tomba 
at the recent Lillehammer Olympics, taking gold to the Italian's silver. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the women, what more can be said of Schneider? 
</P>
<P>
 She entered the day having already clinched the overall and slalom titles. But 
that didn't prevent the 29-year-old veteran from capping her greatest year with 
another victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been as easy as it looks, getting this 51st World Cup win," 
Schneider said. "I'm so tired. I really had to put everything together in my 
mind to still have the energy to ski. I'm overwhelmed about being able to win 
the last slalom under these difficult circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Ertl, who finished third, nearly duplicated the dramatic leap made in 
Saturday's GS by Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who rallied from the 13th 
second-run position to win the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe I could make the top 10, not the top three," Ertl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was the men's slalom canceled and not the women's? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer given was "salt." 
</P>
<P>
 An overnight storm dumped several inches of soft snow on the two slalom 
courses. Using a salt-based chemical to harden the terrain, race organizers 
were able to set the women's course in time. While tending to the men's course, 
however, the temperature dropped about 10 degrees, causing fears that the 
hardening treatment would not hold on the much steeper hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather went in the bucket," said Jim Roberts, the race director. "The 
front came in in an instant. We're very sad to miss the men's event." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomba, naturally, agreed with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the middle of the course (during inspection) when somebody said, 
'No, we can't start in these conditions,' " Tomba said. "I think it was too 
soft for this long of race." Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Nobis was the top American in the slalom, finishing 18th. Anna 
Parisien, the only other U.S. entry, did not finish her first run. . . . 
Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt finished first on the World Cup money list, 
earning $106,794.60 for the season. Alberto Tomba was second, earning $105,567. 
No other male skier earned more than $63,294. Switzerland's Vreni Schneider was 
the women's money leader with $110,256.30. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg unable to ski in three of four events because of 
a rib injury suffered in Wednesday's downhill, Schneider ended up winning the 
overall title by a margin of 1,656 to 1,343. Wiberg and Schneider entered this 
week separated by less than 50 points. . . . Austria ran away with the overall 
Nation's Cup with 8,792 points, followed by Switzerland (6,273) and Italy 
(6,038). The United States finished seventh. Luxembourg, represented only by 
Marc Girardelli, finished 11th.

HOW TV WILL COVER THE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar fans know very well that watching the telecast is only half the fun. 
Seeing the arrivals and the post-mortems is just as important in fueling up to 
participate in the next day's gossiping.To that end, television will be more 
accommodating than ever this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecast of the Academy Awards will begin at 6 p.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 
10 and 42). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Arrivals: KABC-TV Channel 7, cable's E! Entertainment Television channel 
and CNN will chronicle the arrival of celebrities at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. E! begins its coverage at 4 p.m., with Steve Kmetko, Michael Castner 
and Paula Poundstone. KABC's coverage, with Roger Ebert and Pam Thomson 
hosting, begins at 5 p.m. CNN will offer a half-hour special at 2:30 p.m., with 
updates at 3 and 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Post-Show: As soon as the Oscars conclude, E! will be back live with a 
two-hour program featuring interviews and backstage reports. CNN will present a 
live, half-hour summation on "Showbiz Today" at 9:30 p.m. The KABC wrap-up, 
with Ebert's commentary, begins about 10 p.m., after "The Barbara Walters 
Special." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Alternatives: Comedy Central will present its usual lineup opposite the 
Academy Awards tonight, but at the bottom of the screen will run a printed 
"crawl" giving "results, commentary and factoids" about the awards as they are 
announced. The Bravo channel will run award-winning shorts during the Oscar 
telecast, interrupting whenever ABC goes to commercial to show segments taped 
last weekend at the Independent Spirit Awards, which recognize achievement in 
independent films.

SPIRIT AWARDS -- A HOLLYWOOD MAVERICK GETS TAMED; MOVIES: NINTH ANNUAL AWARD 
CEREMONIES FOR INDIE FILMS HAS SUBDUED ATMOSPHERE, MOST WINNERS MISSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They held the Spirit Awards on Saturday for movies produced independent of 
Hollywood's mainstream film companies. But for the first time in its nine 
years, the spirit and spunk of the annual alternative to the Academy Awards 
seemed to be missing. 
</P>
<P>
 What had been the maverick of awards shows has been tamed by the demands of 
the media, security and the sheer size of the crowd -- 1,200 Saturday at the 
Hollywood Paladium. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-actor Buck Henry's acerbic commentaries about Hollywood were absent 
too. Like actor-comedian Billy Crystal of the Oscar show, Henry, the Spirit 
Awards host for many years, bowed out this year, Robert Townsend stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing too were many of the winners. Director Robert Altman's comic and 
biting "Short Cuts" was named best independently made American feature film of 
1993, and producer Cary Brokaw accepted the award. Director Jane Campion's 
Gothic romance, "The Piano," picked up the prize for best independent film made 
in another nation and producer Jan Chapman accepted the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman and Campion are nominees for best director at tonight's Academy Awards, 
but on Saturday Altman was in France making his latest film "Pret a Porter" and 
Campion was in her native New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent also from Saturday's ceremonies, sponsored by the Independent Features 
Project West, was best actress winner Ashley Judd for her role in "Ruby in 
Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Lili Taylor, who appeared in "Household Saints," and Christopher Lloyd, in 
"Twenty Bucks," were named as best supporting actress and actor, but neither 
was present. 
</P>
<P>
 A poignant factor that contributed to the subdued atmosphere this year was the 
recent death of young actor River Phoenix, who won the Spirit Award for best 
actor in 1992's "My Own Private Idaho." Phoenix was remembered in remarks by 
director Richard Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
 Still the Spirit Awards is the kind of event where Sean Penn and Sandra 
Bernhard made presentations. It drew Oscar nominees for best actress, Angela 
Bassett and Holly Hunter, directors Kenneth Branagh, Oliver Stone and keynote 
speaker Jim Sheridan ("My Left Foot" and best picture Oscar nominee "In the 
Name of the Father"). 
</P>
<P>
 And director Jim Jarmusch received the Independent Features Project's John 
Cassavetes Award from actor John Turturro. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an enthusiastic Jeff Bridges who took the stage to claim his best actor 
award, for his role as an ex-con in the film "American Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it was an independent film, we didn't have to compromise our vision. 
We made the film that we set out to make," Bridges said. "Another reason this 
was such a gratifying experience for me was it was a chance to shed some light 
on a part of our society that doesn't get the light shed on it too often . . . 
that's the part of us who live below the poverty line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among other winners was the screenplay for "Short Cuts," by Altman and Frank 
Barhydt, based on the stories by Raymond Carver. That gave "Short Cuts," 
released by Fine Line Pictures, three awards, making it the only multiple 
winner in this year's competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The cinematography by Lisa Rinzler for "Menace II Society" was a winner too. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Robert Rodriguez, whose videotape movie shot for $7,000, "El 
Mariachi," was picked up for distribution by Columbia Pictures last year, 
summed up the financial problems common to independent filmmakers, as he 
accepted the award for best first feature film. 
</P>
<P>
 He said when he learned that Columbia wanted to distribute the film just the 
way it was, rather than re-shoot it, he told executives: "Look, if I had known 
people were going to see it I would have done so many things differently." Then 
to much laughter, he added, ". . . just give me $2,000 and I'll re-shoot half 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Rodriguez told the audience: "It really isn't the wallet that 
makes the movie. It's your creativity, your passion, your hard work."

CALENDAR GOES TO THE OSCARS; A LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENTS BUT ONLY A TINY 
PENSION; MOVIES: FILM EDITOR GENE RUGGIERO'S MONTHLY CHECK IS $242.71. BUT HE 
CLAIMS HE DESERVES ABOUT $1,250 A MONTH.

<P>
 All the happy talk that surrounds Oscar season is met with some bitterness at 
Gene Ruggiero's temporary home. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mantle is his tarnished statuette earned in 1956 for co-editing "Around 
the World in 80 Days" -- now a mottled color more copper than gold. In his 
glory era that also included an Oscar nomination for "Oklahoma!," he sent it 
out to be cleaned, and it came back instead stripped of its thin electroplated 
veneer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years he could afford to have it replated, he didn't. And today, at 83 
and nearly destitute, it'll never happen. 
</P>
<P>
 But sell it at auction to raise needed cash? Never. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best work. My favorite film -- still," he said, nestling it in the crook 
of his arm as he moves over to the couch to sit for a photograph.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Motion Picture Guide, Ruggiero recounts how he and "80 Days" co-editor 
Paul Weatherwax were handed countless reels of film by producer Mike Todd: "I 
told (Todd) to go away for two weeks and leave us alone. And then we cut the 
monster down to something that made sense." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All these decades later, missing nearly all his front teeth and suffering from 
shingles, Ruggiero is in a strange place. He has just collected another trophy, 
the American Cinema Editors' Career Achievement Award, which was given out a 
week ago Saturday by Martin Scorsese -- yet his monthly check from the Motion 
Picture Industry Pension Plan is a mere $242.71. 
</P>
<P>
 After his lifetime of working in the film business, he believes he is owed a 
higher amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no ordinary business . . . it's a crazy business," he said, lucid but 
flummoxed when asked to fully explain his situation. After all, he has worked 
and survived nearly everyone he's known since he moved to Hollywood in the late 
1920s at the express wishes of Loews Inc. President Nicholas Schenck, worked at 
MGM for 31 years, owned and sold production companies, owned screenplay 
properties and story rights, worked well into his 70s -- and still is broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Several failed marriages (he'd rather not discuss the exact number) may have 
had something to do with it. (One ex-wife, Eva, has kindly taken him back in.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some would say it is an oft-told tale, the flip side to the glittery life in 
and around the star factories. Usually, it's the higher-profile actors and 
actresses whose checkered careers are written about -- rarely the fate of 
below-the-line technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruggiero, however, believes his story is more than just a recap of fanciful 
tales about the rich, famous and infamous. Given a rare moment's pause in the 
conversation, he will go on about his regular morning round of golf at 
Hillcrest Country Club with Louis B. Mayer (Ruggiero, a scratch golfer, toyed 
once with turning pro), or how he bested Douglas Fairbanks Sr. in a tournament, 
or how Mario Lanza wouldn't make a picture unless he, Ruggiero, cut it. He'll 
even tell (off the record) a few salacious tidbits about Bugsy Siegal's 
mistress, Virginia Hill, and the real facts of Siegal's gory ambush in his 
Beverly Hills living room -- and it's not the Warren Beatty version seen in 
"Bugsy." John Ford was a "cheapskate" in the salary department, he says, as 
well as a creative gift-giver. Ford's idea of mollifying Ruggiero on "The Wings 
of Eagles" came in the offer of a new putter. 
</P>
<P>
 What's really on Ruggiero's mind, though, is getting the MPIPP to pay him some 
heed. 
</P>
<P>
 And helping him are two screenwriter-producers, Cary Solomon and Chuck 
Konzelman, who met Ruggiero three years ago when he helped them negotiate 
rights on a spec script. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always read about old Hollywood, and he was old Hollywood," said Solomon. 
"He helped us out, and we thought helping him out was the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruggiero believes he banked enough hours as an editor to earn a pension equal 
to that which 30-year editors get, about $1,250 a month. He says that he could 
prove it but that the documents that could do so have long since been lost or 
thrown out. He claims moving to Rome in the '60s to work for offshore 
production companies interrupted payments into the fund. Upon his return to 
Hollywood, he worked on such pictures as "Cast a Giant Shadow" and "Moonshine 
Country Express" while running his own company, Post Production Inc., where he 
believes his employees were awarded hours he was not.  
</P>
<P>
 What he needs is for his former employers -- the Hollywood studios and 
production companies -- to provide documentation for the number of hours he 
worked for them. Problems arise when those same employers, some of them 
independent, are either out of business or never were signatory to the editors 
guild, Local 776. 
</P>
<P>
 MPIPP Administrative Director Harley B. Blakenship said the inch-thick file on 
Ruggiero shows that the editor has initiated two prior inquiries "represented 
by legal counsel . . . neither of which would show a basis for additional 
pension entitlement." Ruggiero, he says, could try again.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ruggiero is sitting on a number of story rights he's entertaining 
offers to sell. One is about the Big Bopper, the '50s novelty hit-maker J. P. 
Richardson, whom the late John Candy had expressed interest in portraying not 
so long ago.

PASSION FOR IDEAS AT FOREIGN-FILM SYMPOSIUM, LUNCH; MOVIES: MODERATOR DECRIES 
THE MEDIOCRITY, EXCESSES OF MOST ENTRIES DESPITE QUALITY OF OSCAR NOMINEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year's Oscar nominees for best foreign language film represent the 
strongest array of worthy contenders within memory. Yet, at the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' annual symposium Saturday at academy 
headquarters in Beverly Hills, moderator George Schaefer stated surprisingly 
that beyond a half-dozen or so top contenders among this year's 35 submissions, 
the rest were "quite disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Film director Schaefer decried a "proliferation of movies with violence, with 
sex carried to ludicrous extremes, even to pornographic excess. This was the 
year of the bathroom, the obligatory vomit scene." Schaefer's blunt opening 
remarks were in stark contrast to his usual observations stressing what a tough 
task it was for the academy to nominate five films from an embarrassment of 
riches. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at lunch at Le Dome, where members of the academy's directors branch 
honored Spain's Fernando Trueba ("Belle Epoque"), China's Chen Kaige (Farewell 
My Concubine"), Wales' Paul Turner ("Hedd Wyn," a beautiful anti-war film not 
yet released in the United States), Vietnam's -- and France's -- Tran Anh Hung 
("The Scent of Green Papaya") and Taiwan's Ang Lee ("The Wedding Banquet"), 
Schaefer asked his fellow directors why so many other foreign films fell so 
short of the nominated group. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy foreign language committee chair Fay Kanin spoke of the problem of 
getting countries to submit their very best films rather than those that were 
the most commercial, which in turn led to a long consideration of how tough it 
is to get movies made and then seen, anywhere, everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 While the luncheon, always genial and amusing, has always been more sedate 
than the symposium, this year the reverse was true. Admittedly, Trueba, fluent 
in English, as are all the foreign directors except Tran, did get off a sharp 
retort during the symposium when someone from the audience asked if he were 
concerned about losing his integrity in making his American film debut in Miami 
with an adaptation of a Donald Westlake novel. "Like virginity, I think the 
best thing to do with integrity is to lose it as quickly as possible," quipped 
Trueba -- "like Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder did," citing foreign directors 
who made dazzling careers in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Trueba ended up with none other than Billy Wilder, who admired "Belle 
Epoque," a mischievous period romantic comedy, as his luncheon partner. As 
Hollywood's puckish senior statesman, Wilder can always be counted upon to come 
with a quip -- "You should get Lorena Bobbitt to cut up your Oscar in five 
parts so you could all be winners" -- but he was also more serious than usual, 
especially in regard to the challenges facing foreign film industries in making 
their mark both on home ground and across the world. He spoke of his friend 
Volker Schlondorff, the eminent German director, who has taken over the 
Babelsburg studios outside Potsdam -- formerly East Germany's DEFA and before 
that, the legendary UFA where the pre-Nazi masterpieces of Lang and Pabst were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, Babelsburg is owned now by the French -- they probably will turn it 
into a St. Tropez," said Wilder. "Babelsburg can't hope to outspend us, out 
special-effects us. They are going to have to make pictures that are German. If 
people in Germany start seeing pictures with ideas they may be successful. You 
need patience -- and enough money to subsidize the next picture. The language 
thing is very difficult, but you can overcome it with a great idea. There's 
only one Schwarzenegger -- thank God! -- but why don't they get their lantsman 
to come back and make a movie?" 
</P>
<P>
 As always, the Hollywood directors expressed envy over the virtually total 
control enjoyed by their foreign colleagues but not necessarily their modest 
budgets and meager salaries -- Tran, for example, earned only $40,000 for 
making "The Scent of Green Papaya," his evocation of a vanished Vietnam. Even 
Chen, thanks to his Hong Kong producer who expressed her confidence in him by 
refusing to see any of "Farewell My Concubine" until its premiere, enjoyed 
total autonomy of his $4-million historical epic. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen, who thinks conditions in China are worse and more unpredictable than 
ever, believes that the reason that the Oscars this year will not be seen in 
China is because his film was nominated. Nevertheless, he hopes that his next 
picture will be -- "Madame Mao." 
</P>
<P>
 As the evils of economics and know-nothing studio heads were bandied about, it 
was left to Paul Mazursky to sum up quietly the luncheon's lively discussion. 
"As romantic as it sounds, I think the obligation is still ours. If we're not 
willing to fight for ideas and to take less money, too bad. We can't lose our 
passion for ideas."

 Two Information Age entrepreneurs who already have earned massive fortunes in 
telephone and computer technology are teaming up to build what they hope will 
be a $9-billion worldwide satellite communications network. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture, backed by computer software whiz William H. Gates and cellular 
telephone executive Craig O. McCaw, would economically bring two-way voice and 
digital communication to isolated communities around the globe beyond the reach 
of traditional land-based telephone lines. If successful, the venture would 
create the biggest and most ambitious satellite system to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates is chairman of Microsoft Corp., the world's largest computer software 
company, and McCaw founded McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest cellular 
telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
 Their joint venture, to be called Teledesic Corp., based in Kirkland, Wash., 
plans to launch 840 small satellites over the next seven years so that it can 
begin offering the service worldwide by 2001. It expects to file its proposal 
for the service with the Federal Communications Commission today. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the network has been under design for nearly four years, the financing 
for the ambitious system has not yet been worked out, said Russell Daggatt, a 
communications lawyer who is president of Teledesic. 
</P>
<P>
 Daggatt said the company hopes to attract investment from telecommunications 
equipment manufacturers and governments of countries that lack broad 
communications networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The design is fairly advanced from a technological standpoint," Daggatt said 
in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C. "To actually do it requires 
broad international cooperation. It is beyond the ability of two individuals, 
beyond any company or country, to do it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very, very vast undertaking, with lots of manufacturers and service 
providers pulling together," said Robert A. Ratliffe, McCaw's vice president 
for communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledesic would not be the first such venture, though as planned it would be 
by far the most extensive satellite network. Motorola Corp. is building a 
$3.3-billion system, called Iridium, that would rely on 66 satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the Teledesic network would provide telephone communications, 
computer linkages and two-way video conferences between any two points in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of it as a global Internet," Daggatt said, referring to the highly 
popular computer communications network. 
</P>
<P>
 Daggatt said that the satellite network would not deliver entertainment 
services or television programming, but would concentrate on providing 
educational and medical information and communication. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Gates and McCaw together own about 30% of Teledesic, though he 
declined to say how much each man had invested or what the company is worth. He 
said that McCaw Cellular owns a smaller piece of the company, and a Los Angeles 
venture fund headed by telecommunications engineer Edward Tuck owns about 10%. 
Daggatt credited Tuck with first "inspiring the technical effort" and getting 
the investors involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Daggatt said that the ownership stakes in the venture would be diluted as new 
partners come on board. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a spokesman for Microsoft, that software company is not directly 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is apparently something that Bill is doing on his own," Microsoft 
spokesman Marty Taucher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daggatt said the design challenge was to develop a system that was 
comprehensive yet affordable, suitable for linking the far reaches of the 
Amazon as well as isolated pockets of rural Montana. He said that the design 
has been discussed and reviewed among scientists, including those at the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratliffe said the system is viewed as a link between the Information Age haves 
and have-nots. "Craig has a strong feelings about bringing communications to 
remote parts of the world, and it is in that spirit that they are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates co-founded Microsoft and built it into a software behemoth. His personal 
fortune is estimated at $7 billion, making him the second-richest man in 
America behind investor Warren Buffett. 
</P>
<P>
 McCaw also has built a vast personal fortune as well as a corporate 
powerhouse. His company is in the process of being acquired by American 
Telephone & Telegraph Co. for $12.6 billion.

RULING PARTY TAKES BIG LEAD IN SALVADOR VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government's right-wing political party jumped to a substantial lead 
Sunday over leftist former guerrillas in peaceful but flawed elections, the 
first voting since the end of El Salvador's bloody civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the ruling Nationalist 
Republican Alliance, or Arena, was leading by nearly a 2-1 margin over leftist 
legislator Ruben Zamora. But Zamora insisted that a runoff will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The former rebels who dominate Zamora's coalition party angrily denounced a 
host of irregularities that prevented thousands of people from casting ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 With the full political spectrum participating for the first time in 
Salvadoran history, the elections were seen as an important step in El 
Salvador's struggle to rebuild and heal deep wounds after a war that claimed 
75,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, 
battled U.S.-backed forces for 12 years until both sides were forced to 
negotiate a settlement. U.N.-brokered peace accords ended the war in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels agreed to disarm in exchange for sweeping political, military and 
judicial reforms, many of which are still incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary results tabulated by the Jesuit-run University of Central America 
and the Spanish-language U.S. television network Telemundo gave Calderon Sol 
48.7% of the vote nationwide, to 25.8% for Zamora. If no candidate receives 
more than 50% of the vote, a runoff is required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Arena were claiming victory Sunday, while supporters in cars, 
honking horns and waving red, white and blue flags, pushed through the streets 
of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvadorans were also choosing all 84 legislators and 262 mayors nationwide. 
Results in these races were not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 Only scattered violence was reported in Sunday's elections. But a number of 
irregularities were observed by journalists and international monitoring teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting stations opened with up to two-hour delays; scores of people with valid 
voter cards were not included in official registrar lists and thus not allowed 
to vote; lines that stretched for blocks under a searing tropical sun moved 
painfully slowly, and there were isolated reports of double voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these irregularities take away from the transparency, honesty and 
liberty of this event," said the FMLN's top official, Schafik Handal, a veteran 
Communist who ran for mayor of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 Handal spoke at a hastily called news conference of the FMLN's senior 
five-member command an hour after the polls closed. The command members were 
clearly angry at what they called the Supreme Electoral Tribunal's deliberate 
strategy of impeding voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribunal is the government agency in charge of overseeing elections and is 
controlled by pro-government magistrates. 
</P>
<P>
 "These irregularities, and they must be understood as such, are a form of 
fraud," FMLN leader Francisco Jovel said. "It isn't the fraud of military 
dictatorships, of filling ballot boxes and taking them to the barracks. Today 
it is a fraud in the sense that the people have been denied their 
constitutional right to vote. . . . We are talking about a lot of people who 
had the desire to vote, and today that was frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora himself, speaking to reporters later Sunday, took a more moderate tone. 
He said he was confident he would dispute a second round of voting with 
Calderon Sol, and pledged to make the system work better than it did Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult to determine independently just what impact the delays and 
other problems would have on election results. California Democrat Rep. Dan 
Hamburg, part of a team of observers, said late Sunday: "There's a consistent 
pattern of something between willful incompetence and just plain incompetence. 
. . . It isn't like any one thing was so horrible. It's like five votes here, 
10 votes there." 
</P>
<P>
 Turnout was estimated by local television at between 55% and 60%, or about 1.4 
million people. Authorities before Sunday had predicted that more than 2 
million people would vote. 
</P>
<P>
 President Alfredo Cristiani, who by law is barred from running for reelection, 
acknowledged minor irregularities early in the day. He did not immediately 
comment on the FMLN's specific charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is perfect," he said. "The important thing is that these problems are 
not intentional." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, many voters said Sunday's exercise represented a marked 
departure from the past, when fighting, rebel boycotts and fear marked 
elections that were riddled with fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "These elections are important for all Salvadorans (as) an opportunity to show 
that we all have a right to express our opinions," said Ernesto Rodriguez, 36, 
who was voting accompanied by his family. "Here among us are people who were 
carrying guns, and now they're participating in an electoral process, and that 
is the most important thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've voted in past elections, but there were fewer people (because) we were 
afraid to come and vote," Ena de Rivas, 26, whose sister lives in Los Angeles, 
said as she left a voting station in the densely populated San Salvador suburb 
of Soyapango. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters, however, met only frustration. To vote, a Salvadoran citizen with 
a valid voter-registration card must report to the appropriate voting station, 
find his or her name on a computer printout of the registrar and then report to 
his or her assigned voting table to receive and deposit the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 In many voting stations visited by journalists, hundreds of people could be 
seen searching for their names on the pink computer printouts, taped to the 
walls of gymnasiums or nailed to trees and often not posted in alphabetical 
order. If the name does not appear, the person cannot vote. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman searched for her name for two hours -- finding the names of her dead 
father, her dead uncle and a sister who left El Salvador for Australia nine 
years ago. But she never found her own name -- even though she possessed a 
valid voter card -- and was not allowed to cast a ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people just give up and leave," said police agent Gloria Zamora, who 
was helping people find their names at a voting station in a San Salvador. "A 
lot of people don't know how to read, and the lists are really a mess. We are 
losing a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey contracted by a group of reporters revealed that the highest 
incidence of frustrated voters occurred in former war zones. By late morning, 
10% of the people who tried to vote in the northeastern town of Chalatenango 
were unable to do so; the rate was 5% in the towns of Suchitoto and Tecaluca. 
By contrast, in Santa Tecla, an upper-middle-class suburb of San Salvador, the 
rate was 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 There were scattered reports of double voting. Zamora's campaign manager, 
Hector Silva, found that when he presented himself at the voting booth, someone 
had already voted in his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only allowed to vote because I am a legislator and television cameras 
were on top of me," Silva said. "Undoubtedly, if it is lack of ability, it is a 
huge lack of ability. A low turnout goes against us. Intentional or not, we are 
affected by the turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 In Guazapa, a town north of San Salvador on the skirts of a dormant volcano 
that was once the scene of vicious guerrilla battles and air force bombings, 
more than 200 people had lined up by 7 a.m. But the polls opened an hour later. 
Juan de Dios Fernandez, a corn farmer in a straw hat, had hiked and taken a bus 
beginning at 4 a.m. to reach the school where he was assigned to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an obligation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris Valle, a 24-year-old former FMLN fighter, was voting for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make things different," he said. "If things don't change, I'll 
have to go to the States. But if things change, I will stay here forever in the 
struggle, here with my beans and corn." 
</P>
<P>
 The irregularities in Sunday's voting did not necessarily follow political 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a sweltering gymnasium in Zacamil, a working-class suburb of San 
Salvador, Santos Pleitez de Sigaran, 49, would have liked to vote for Arena 
because she believes that the party helped bring peace to El Salvador. But her 
name was not on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "One comes with good intentions, but if they don't let me vote, well, there's 
nothing I can do," she said after she could not find her name. "I am not going 
to force it. It does not make me happy. By right, my name had to be there."

5.3 AFTERSHOCK RATTLES SOUTHLAND; TEMBLOR: FRIGHTENED PEOPLE FLEE STORES AND 
MOVIE THEATERS AND TWO FIRES ARE STARTED. BUT THERE IS LITTLE OTHER DAMAGE FROM 
THIRD-LARGEST JOLT SINCE THE JAN. 17 NORTHRIDGE QUAKE.

<P>
 A powerful aftershock to the Northridge earthquake rolled across Southern 
California on Sunday, starting two fires, briefly disrupting power to thousands 
of San Fernando Valley residents and sending people fleeing from stores and 
movie theaters, but causing little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5.3 magnitude quake, centered near Panorama City, was felt over a wide 
area of Los Angeles and Orange counties when it hit at 1:20 p.m. It was the 
third-strongest of more than 5,000 aftershock to hit the region since the Jan. 
17 quake, which killed at least 61 people and caused at least $13 billion in 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeways sustained some cracking in the aftershock, but none were closed, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city Fire Department officials said two fires were started by the 
earthquake. A mini-mall blaze in Van Nuys began because of electrical damage 
caused by the quake, and a transformer at a Department of Water and Power plant 
near Burbank Airport caught fire after earthquake damage caused oil in the unit 
to overheat, said Jim Wells, a Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sherman Oaks house, moved off its foundation by the Jan. 17 quake and 
scheduled for demolition today, was sent sliding another 25 feet down the 
hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaker rattled nerves as well, although no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 For fans camped outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for tonight's Oscar 
ceremonies, the quake was a second authentic L.A. experience -- but it did not 
move them from their cherished places. Rhea Sprecher, an art teacher from 
Wisconsin, still managed to spot Debbie Allen, Goldie Hawn and others. "I felt 
some rumbling under my feet and I said: 'Would that be an earthquake?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, where organizers were rehearsing the introduction for the visual 
effects Oscar, chandeliers swayed, the seats rocked and huge pieces of scenery 
rattled. "Everybody, stay in your seats!" Oscar director Jeff Margolis ordered 
over the public address system. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, a minor rockslide failed to disrupt traffic. And in Santa Monica, 
life in the bustling Third Street Promenade shopping and dining area was back 
to normal shortly after the temblor stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seismically, this is a very expected behavior. Probably the big news story in 
this earthquake is people's nerves," said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities reported little damage to homes and businesses, hundreds 
of people were evacuated from malls and theaters in the San Fernando Valley 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, about 1,000 people were removed from IKEA, a home furnishings 
store in Burbank. Despite shoppers' anxiety, the evacuation was quick and 
orderly, said Dennis Rodriguez, the store's operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were a little frightened. We got workers together with customers and 
guided them downstairs," Rodriguez said. Some children were separated from 
parents but were reunited outside the building, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 500 shoppers were evacuated from the Fashion Square Mall in Sherman 
Oaks, where the aftershock shattered plate glass alongside an escalator and 
sent some overhead spotlights crashing to the floor. No one was injured at the 
mall, where the first 34 of the complex's 140 stores closed since the Jan. 17 
quake reopened Saturday, employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the rain yesterday and another aftershock today," said Bob Smith, a 
mall employee. "It's been a tough weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley movie theaters, patrons fled their seats as they were showered with 
broken plaster and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 James Booth of Burbank was on a bucket lift filling cracks on the second floor 
of the Cal State Northridge science building when the shaking hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was this jackass shaking the bottom of the lift," Booth said, 
pointing to a co-worker. "I thought the entire building was going to come 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Mid-City area, Percy Bennett's furniture and appliance store still had 
plywood up from the Jan. 17 quake, which shattered its glass front. Inside, 
another souvenir of Jan. 17 is the ceiling that still has a hole the size of a 
big screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Bennett just pulled his merchandise out onto the sidewalk and kept 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 "This quake was nothing compared to that big one," he said. "I was sitting 
here on this (exercise bike) just peddling along when I started swaying. But 
yeah, I sure could feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Monica conference of the Anxiety Disorders Assn. of America ended with 
a bang as the quake struck. "I tell you, the timing couldn't have been better. 
It was the last day, the last minute, the last second and it hit. It was pretty 
ironic," said association President Jerilyn Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 At Disneyland in Anaheim, some of the more elaborate attractions were 
temporarily closed down. At Universal Studios in Universal City, all 
attractions closed immediately after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cangco of Glendale was on a tram going over a bridge that falls apart as 
part of the special effects tour when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize it was an earthquake at the time. I thought it was an effect 
of the . . . tram." 
</P>
<P>
 The ride continued, and only when the 45-minute trip ended did someone inform 
the riders that a real earthquake had hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock knocked out power to about 77,000 San Fernando Valley 
residents, most for five minutes or less, DWP spokeswoman Mindy Berman said. 
However, about 7,000 customers in Van Nuys were without electricity for half an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans reported minor damage to freeways near the epicenter of the 
aftershock but none serious enough to close any roads. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Golden State Freeway north of Granada Hills, the aftershock dislodged 
temporary asphalt filler that had been used to close a 6-to-8-inch gap caused 
by the Northridge quake. Temporary asphalt fixes also came loose in a concrete 
overpass at the interchange of the Simi Valley and San Diego freeways. Caltrans 
crews quickly refilled the gaps without shutting down any freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that would alarm anyone," said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie 
Tiritilli. "It's super-minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech seismologists said the aftershock was expected, and in the normal 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is perfectly normal. This is what we expect," said Egill Hauksson, a 
seismologist at Caltech. He said Sunday's shaking occurred on the east side of 
the fault plane where the main shock occurred on Jan. 17, but was not on the 
same fault. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock was centered about two miles west-northwest of Panorama City, 
and about three miles northeast of the epicenter of the Northridge quake, said 
Hutton, within a "pie-shaped aftershock zone" where shocks have been clustered. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock was closer to the surface than the Northridge quake, with 
preliminary estimates putting it about nine miles below the earth's surface, 
compared to 12 miles for the main Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 With a preliminary magnitude of 5.3, the quake is 1/20 the magnitude of the 
main Jan. 17 quake. Hutton said the number of aftershocks continues to decline 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's temblor "is an aftershock, but it is also an earthquake on its own" 
and will produce its own aftershocks, she said. However, there is only a 1 in 
20 chance that it was a foreshock to a larger quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3.4 magnitude aftershock was recorded at 3:34 p.m. Sunday, and another 
reading 2.7 hit at 8:05 p.m., seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a spokesman for Farmers Insurance Co. said Sunday's major 
aftershock could temporarily suspend earthquake insurance underwriting in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geologists may call this an aftershock, but this is a separate quake for 
insurance purposes," Jeffrey Beyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows insurers to impose a moratorium of up to 60 days on sales of 
earthquake insurance after a quake occurs. A moratorium after the Jan. 17 
Northridge quake covered about 100 square miles and lasted no more than 30 days 
at many companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any moratoriums still in effect," Bill Schulz, spokesman for 
the state Department of Insurance, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock prompted some business owners and authorities to close some 
public structures so they could check for structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, owners shut down the 75-store Media City Center mall for the day 
after sprinklers jolted by the aftershock drenched some shoppers. City building 
inspectors also ordered the mall parking structure closed until it could be 
inspected, said Lt. Don Brown of the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Glendale Galleria, "we heard the building just rumble," said Drew 
Boghorsyan of the mall's customer services department. Merchants at 26 of the 
mall's 248 stores closed up shop to go home, but Boghorsyan knew of no damage. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said schools will be 
open as usual today, although workers will inspect repairs from the January 
quake to make sure they held. In all, 76 public schools were damaged in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, the district's facilities director, said: "We will be out at the 
schools where there was previous damage to make sure the repairs are still 
holding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to hit the ones that had the most damage and the least permanent 
repair work done and work our way back from there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington, D.C.-based Anxiety Disorders Assn. had been discussing such 
problems as quake-related stress in its four-day conference at the Loews Santa 
Monica Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final seminar drew to a close Sunday, the fifth-floor banquet room 
began to shake and the chandeliers rattled noisily. The seminar ended with 
applause and laughter -- for the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the conference had featured a seminar called "The Los Angeles 
Earthquake and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder." And some of the psychiatrists 
and social workers later kidded one another about earthquakes. "Jokingly, we 
who'd never experienced an earthquake said: 'Gee, I wish I could feel just a 
little one so I could know what it feels like,' " Ross said.

POST-DISASTER MENTAL HEALTH EFFORTS DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is becoming a tradition in Los Angeles: In the wake of a disaster, federal 
money pours into the city for long-term psychological counseling and other 
mental health programs to help Angelenos cope. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 riots, the Federal Emergency Management Agency allotted more 
than $11 million to the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health for a 
riot-related mental health program called Project Rebound-Civil Unrest, a 
program that at the beginning was plagued by so many administrative problems 
that program organizers found it difficult to spend all the money they had been 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 After the wildfires last fall, FEMA allocated almost $500,000 for Project 
Rebound-Firestorms, an extensive mental health program that relatively few 
people ever used. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the wake of the Jan. 17 earthquake and its continuing aftershocks, 
comes the biggest -- and most expensive -- disaster-related mental health 
program ever undertaken in Los Angeles. Project Rebound-Earthquakes, operated 
like its predecessors under the auspices of the county Department of Mental 
Health, has been allocated $11.6 million by FEMA -- and about $17 million more 
is being requested. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is: Have those multimillion-dollar mental health programs really 
done any good? 
</P>
<P>
 To mental health professionals, the answer is obvious. They believe 
passionately that counseling is as important to the rebuilding process as steel 
and bricks and mortar, that every dollar spent on mental health counseling is a 
dollar well spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't underestimate the costs of long-term, post-traumatic stress" after 
disasters, said Robert Scott, a psychologist who has advised the Red Cross on 
disaster-related mental health efforts. "Every dollar you put in immediate 
mental health programs can save hundreds of dollars in long-term emotional 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 But others -- either less sensitive or more practical -- complain that what a 
city needs after a disaster is more shovels, not more social workers. In the 
immediate aftermath of the earthquake, as counselors from various agencies 
fanned out across the city to offer free emergency counseling at shelters and 
parks, even some of the people hardest hit by the quake seemed more concerned 
about what was happening around their bodies than inside their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (counseling) is there, and it's not too hard to get to, I guess it would 
be OK for some people," Verna Stewart, 22, said as she sat on a cot at the Red 
Cross shelter at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys a day after the earthquake 
destroyed her Tarzana apartment. "For me, as long as I'm with my family and 
friends, that's all the support I need. What I really need right now is a place 
to live." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mind?" asked Alberto Garcia, 35, as he sprawled on a blanket in Recreation 
Park in San Fernando, riding out aftershocks with his wife and their three 
children. "My mind is OK. I just wish (the ground) would stop shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, thousands of people have received some form of Project 
Rebound-Earthquakes service, ranging from serious psychological treatment to a 
few reassuring words as they stood in line at assistance centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics provided by Project Rebound-Earthquakes show that in the first five 
weeks after the earthquake more than 9,000 people called the program's crisis 
hot line; during the first week of March, calls were still coming in at a rate 
of up to 150 a day, program officials said. And aftershocks such as Sunday's 
magnitude 5.3 shaker do little to calm frayed nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Rebound-Earthquake's 550 counselors and representatives -- who are 
Department of Mental Health employees, workers loaned from other counties and 
counselors from private agencies hired by Project Rebound -- have made more 
than 29,000 counseling contacts at shelters, disaster assistance centers and 
parks where fearful earthquake victims congregated. 
</P>
<P>
 (The American Red Cross, which operates its own privately funded 
post-earthquake mental health program, reports more than 36,000 counseling 
contacts since Jan. 17. However, according to Red Cross disaster mental health 
services officer Dusty Bowenkamp, the Red Cross will soon wrap up its program 
and leave long-term counseling programs to Project Rebound.) 
</P>
<P>
 All told, in the first five weeks after the earthquake, the period when it 
would seem that the demand for counseling would be highest, more than 38,000 
people received some form of mental health assistance through Project Rebound 
-- 74,000 if the Red Cross program is included. 
</P>
<P>
 That may not sound like very many for a disaster that touched millions in one 
way or another. But Project Rebound officials say it is only the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be seeing many, many more people," Project Rebound-Earthquakes 
Director Patricia Mendoza said. "It's going to take a long time for the fear to 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also going to take a lot of money; the FEMA-financed mental health 
services do not come cheap. More than half of the initial $11.6 million FEMA 
grant, about $6.3 million, is being used to contract with private social 
service agencies to provide counseling services; mental health workers from 
those agencies are paid $65 an hour for licensed psychologists to $20 an hour 
for graduate school interns to $12 an hour for "paraprofessional 
outreach/community workers." An additional $1.8 million is being spent on 
salaries for Project Rebound employees. Other expenses range from $176,000 for 
the crisis hot line to $173,000 for office supplies to $708 for telephone 
pagers for Project Rebound workers. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just for the initial, short-term mental health program. To provide 
long-term earthquake-related mental health services, Project 
Rebound-Earthquakes is in the process of applying for an additional $17-million 
FEMA grant for a nine-month program of counseling, disaster preparedness 
training and other mental health efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The effectiveness of mental health programs is difficult to quantify. And 
almost everyone agrees that the earthquake was a much different form of 
disaster -- from a mental health standpoint -- than any previous disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if previous Project Rebound programs are any indication, the earthquake 
mental health program could turn out to be a case of too much, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The original Project Rebound, Project Rebound-Civil Unrest, got off to a rocky 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 (The name is an acronym for "Rebuilding and Empowerment by Outreach, 
Understanding, Networking and Dedication"; the words Civil Unrest were added 
later to distinguish it from subsequent post-disaster mental health efforts.) 
</P>
<P>
 That there might be a need for mental health counseling programs was apparent 
to anyone who saw the shell-shocked looks on people's faces as they stood amid 
the smoky ruins of their homes, their businesses or their lives. But six months 
after the riots, long after the smoke had cleared, after most people had gotten 
on with their lives, county officials were still struggling to organize the 
mental health effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with millions in FEMA money, Project Rebound organizers were trying to 
hire "contract agencies" in riot-affected areas to provide psychological 
counseling programs. Eventually more than 35 organizations, from the Los 
Angeles Unified School District to the National Conference of Christians and 
Jews, received Project Rebound grants. 
</P>
<P>
 But some private social service agencies declined to participate, citing 
extensive federal paperwork requirements. There was a shortage of bilingual 
counselors to provide services in minority neighborhoods. And almost $750,000 
was used just to administer the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort took so long to get off the ground that Project Rebound had to 
return almost half of its original $5.9-million FEMA grant because it couldn't 
spend it before the grant expired. It later received another grant for $8.2 
million. (The Project Rebound grants accounted for about 8% of all riot-related 
FEMA grants in Los Angeles. That figure does not include other federal 
allocations, such as Small Business Administration loans.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza estimated that 400,000 people eventually were served in some way by 
post-riot Project Rebound mental health programs -- some through face-to-face 
counseling, far more through brief contacts over telephone hot lines and 
educational programs at schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time Project Rebound-Civil Unrest ended last November, the money 
was being used for programs that had only a marginal connection to the riots of 
18 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, for example, the National Conference of Christians and Jews used 
part of a $330,000-Project Rebound grant for a weekend retreat for Latino high 
school students at a private camp in Glendale. The riots were hardly mentioned 
at the retreat, which followed earlier ones for black students and mixed-race 
groups. Instead, discussion sessions bore titles such as "Relationships," 
"Gay/Lesbian/Bisexuality" and "Life After High School." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just as the Project Rebound-Civil Unrest was winding down, firestorms 
ravaged Malibu, Laguna and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The mental health efforts for fire victims began last October, before the 
fires had even been put out, when FEMA awarded a $399,000-grant to the county 
Department of Mental Health for emergency counseling programs for fire victims. 
Later, another $65,000 grant was added, with the money being about equally 
divided between Malibu and Altadena. The program was dubbed Project 
Rebound-Firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the fires, as happened after the earthquake, Project 
Rebound-Firestorms personnel went to the disaster areas, and to Red Cross and 
other relief centers, to answer questions and provide other on-the-spot help. 
Later the counseling programs, operated by local social service agencies hired 
by Project Rebound, moved into disaster relief centers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Altadena area, the counselors set up shop in the Community Disaster 
Recovery and Preparedness Center in Pasadena, a 3,000-square-foot office that 
served as a fire-related operations center for FEMA, the state Office of 
Emergency Services, insurance industry representatives and other disaster 
relief agencies. The center, open Monday through Saturday, opened Dec. 27. 
Counselors from two Project Rebound-Firestorms contract agencies, Pacific 
Clinics and Foothill Family Service, were on hand to provide crisis counseling, 
organize survivors support groups and perform other mental health functions. 
</P>
<P>
 But three months after the wildfires raged through Altadena, destroying 151 
homes, there was good news and bad news about the mental health of area 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news was that if the response to the Project Rebound counseling 
programs was any indication, the mental health of fire area residents was 
almost shockingly sound. Although thousands of people were affected by the 
fires, only a few dozen people had showed up for counseling programs in the 
first two weeks after the opening of the Community Disaster Recovery and 
Preparedness Center. One support group drew just two participants -- and they 
were married to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news, as far as some fire-area residents were concerned, was that 
taxpayers had spent about $230,000 for those underused programs for victims of 
the Altadena fires -- money that they said could have been better used 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an awful lot of money," Frank Griffith of the Eaton Canyon Recovery 
Alliance, an umbrella group representing eight homeowners' associations in the 
fire area, said in a pre-earthquake interview. "That's 80 more fire hydrants we 
could upgrade. If you ask me, people up here would be a lot more 
psychologically relaxed if they just had more hydrants and water tanks and 
escape routes." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar opinions are offered by other fire-area residents, even while they 
gave federal and state agencies high marks for other firestorm disaster relief 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were watching our kids (in the preschool), but none of the kids had any 
signs of problems," said Beverly Slocum, a preschool director, as she and her 
husband Dick worked in their fire-damaged yard on Kinneloa Canyon Road. "People 
we know are having a lot more problems with their insurance companies than they 
are with their mental health." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taking a while for the word to get around," admitted Molly Proctor, a 
Foothill Family Service counselor who worked at the disaster recovery center. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Clark, an Office of Emergency Services spokeswoman, said an average of 
three to five people sought psychological services daily at the center in its 
first two weeks of operation. An estimated 20,000 people live in the Altadena 
fire area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, the director of Project Rebound-Firestorms as well as Project 
Rebound-Earthquakes, said several factors may have contributed to the low 
demand in Altadena, including the relative affluence of the residents, many of 
whom have the resources to turn to private mental health services if they 
desire help; the holiday season, which diverted people's attention, and the 
fact that disaster-related psychological problems can take a long time to 
manifest themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the immediate aftermath of a disaster people tend to devote their energies 
to more immediate things such as dealing with insurance companies," she said. 
"People will put the emotional stuff on the back burner . . . I think in the 
future people will find their way to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some Altadena residents weren't sure they needed, or wanted, government 
sponsored mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel lucky, not emotionally damaged," said Kellin Francis, whose home on 
Kinneloa Canyon Road suffered only landscaping and outbuilding damage in the 
fire. As for government-sponsored mental health help, Francis said, "To people 
around here that has an aura of welfare. If they need that kind of thing, 
they'll probably go to a family doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is probably too early to predict whether Project Rebound-Earthquakes will 
become like Project Rebound-Firestorms or Project Rebound-Civil Unrest, that 
is, a program that, however well-intentioned, is not used by very many people, 
or one that seems to last long after the disaster that created it is becoming a 
dim memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake, of course, was far different from other disasters. For one 
thing, it affected a wide group of people, rich as well as poor. Also, mental 
health professionals say, it is a recurring trauma. Every time there is an 
aftershock, Mendoza and others say, there is a spike in the hot-line calls and 
visits to earthquake counseling centers. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how long that will last, or how many people out there need 
counseling, but for one reason or another have not sought it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just been touching the tip of the iceberg," said Cedric McRae, a 
regional coordinator for Project Rebound, as he stood amid the organized chaos 
of the Earthquake Service Center on the Westside.

PAINSTAKING EFFORTS EXPOSE STATE'S LARGEST OIL SPILL; POLLUTION: UNOCAL ADMITS 
PROBLEMS OVER 40-YEAR PERIOD. FIRM IS TAKING MORE EXTENSIVE CLEANUP MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathy Johannes remembers the winter of 1988 in vivid detail: Dozens of seals 
and sea lions struggled ashore and suffered fatal seizures on the beaches of 
Central California. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals all had an oily sheen, and beneath their fur she could see that 
their skin was inflamed. Soon, the volunteer animal rescue worker became 
convinced that the deaths were linked to frequent oily discharges from the 
Unocal Corp. oil field on the sand dunes of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Los Angeles based-company denied that it had spilled any oil, and 
local authorities declined to take action. "In 1988 we were telling them there 
was a problem and nobody listened," Johannes said. "Nobody did anything about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks largely to a new state agency funded by a tax on oil companies, 
Unocal's pollution problems at the Guadalupe field are no longer being ignored. 
Evidence painstakingly collected by the state Office of Oil Spill Prevention 
and Response shows that for 15 years, some Unocal employees sought to cover up 
what has become the largest petroleum spill in California history. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators found that as far back as 1978, employees at the field 
were told not to call attention to repeated spills of diluent, a petroleum 
thinner used in large quantities to dilute Guadalupe's heavy crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 When one diluent spill formed an oil slick 4 1/2 miles long on the ocean in 
1986, Unocal remained silent. When questioned about another ocean spill in 
1988, the company produced laboratory tests incorrectly showing that Unocal was 
not to blame. Under state law, oil companies must report any petroleum spill 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unocal misstated the facts in a way that the government regulators were 
misled about the true nature of the pollution problem," said warden Allen N. 
Huckaby, the dogged investigator for the oil spill agency who helped break open 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Unocal acknowledged this month that it has leaked up to 8.5 million 
gallons of the clear, diesel-like fluid into the ground in a series of 
discharges and pipeline breaks over 40 years. The company pleaded no contest 
last week to three misdemeanor pollution charges -- including failing to report 
ocean spills -- and was ordered to pay $1.5 million in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Unocal officials, embarrassed by the revelations, insist that they were 
shocked to learn of the magnitude of the spill and disappointed by the failure 
of employees to notify authorities when leaks occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Vice President John F. Imle Jr., who personally entered the 
company's no contest plea in court, insisted that the firm's highest levels of 
management never ordered a cover-up. But he conceded that workers at the aging 
oil field, worried that pollution problems could shut down the operation, may 
have kept the spills quiet to protect their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities uncovered no evidence that top officials of the company helped 
conceal the spills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can assure you there was never an institutional cover-up," Imle said. 
"Somewhere in the system, we dropped the ball. . . . We will review our own 
procedures to see where they broke down." 
</P>
<P>
 Leased by Unocal since the early 1950s, the oil field is spread among the sand 
dunes at the southern edge of San Luis Obispo County, a mile from the little 
town of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach, where the field's first wells were drilled, is the site of Unocal's 
greatest problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on the best of days, the odor of diluent rises from the sand. Beneath the 
beach, diluent from numerous spills sits on top of the ground water in an 
underground pool. 
</P>
<P>
 On the worst of days -- usually during winter high tides -- the ocean scours 
away the sand down to the water table and washes the diluent into the ocean, 
where it poses a hazard to surfers and aquatic life. 
</P>
<P>
 Some surfers say they have suffered rashes from exposure to the diluent. One 
group of surfers has notified Unocal that it intends to sue the company under 
Proposition 65, which requires businesses to warn the public of exposure to 
cancer-causing chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the marine mammals recovered by Johannes, wildlife experts 
question what kind of damage the leaks have done to marine creatures, 
particularly the Pismo clam, found four miles north at Pismo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last decade, there have been years when the clams have produced 
virtually no offspring. Biologists have generally attributed the unusual 
reproductive pattern to ocean currents and the voracious appetite of the sea 
otter. But Unocal officials say they plan to study whether the spills could 
have been responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, we have seen no evidence to connect it, but it's not conclusive," 
said Marjorie Hatter, who was recently assigned by Unocal to head the cleanup 
effort. "We have a lot more work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Farther inland under the oil field, test wells have found greater 
concentrations of diluent floating on top of ground water. Altogether, there 
are 28 plumes of the fluid, with the largest concentration near tanks used to 
store and distribute the diluent for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the repeated seepage of diluent into the ocean, the massive spill 
-- caused by broken pipelines, overflowing tanks and careless handling of the 
cheap and plentiful liquid -- might have gone unnoticed for many more years. 
Spilled diluent usually soaked quickly into the sandy, porous ground without 
leaving visible signs. Ground water beneath the oil field is not used for 
drinking, so the contamination did not surface in wells. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the winter of 1990, a major ocean spill forced the company to 
acknowledge that the petroleum was coming from its oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 The company stopped using diluent, shut down most oil production at the field, 
installed wells on the beach to pump out the fluid and built a submerged 
seawall in an unsuccessful attempt to stop further ocean spills. But the 
company still did not acknowledge the full extent of the leaks at the field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until 1993 -- after the oil spill agency had seized some of 
Unocal's records and ordered the company to drill a dozen test wells -- that 
the company admitted there was contamination throughout the oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until then, I don't think anyone (outside Unocal) even had a remote 
indication there was this kind of a problem," said Stephen L. Sawyer, a lawyer 
with the Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response. "The pattern of failing 
to report is the (heart) of the offense. If they had reported as required, all 
the leaks throughout the field might not have occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 The oil spill agency, which was created by the Legislature after the 
Huntington Beach oil spill of 1989, is preparing to file a civil suit this week 
seeking penalties of as much as $170 million from Unocal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the end of the criminal case against the company, the Guadalupe oil 
field is being transformed into a cleanup site. 
</P>
<P>
 In one part of the field, workers are drilling wells in a pilot project to see 
how effectively they can recover diluent floating on the ground water. 
Elsewhere, experts are taking carbon dioxide measurements and sinking test 
probes to map out the location of the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that its earlier beach cleanup efforts failed, Unocal is proposing 
to stop the ocean spills once and for all this spring by excavating the beach 
several feet down to the water table, installing a wall farther inland to halt 
the migration of diluent, and replacing the beach with clean sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the oil field, the company proposes to drill wells to pump up the 
diluent, recovering about 30% of what is there. Then they plan to rely on 
bacteria to consume the rest of the product, pumping oxygen and moisture into 
the ground to accelerate the natural process. The entire project could take 
five years. Within the same period, Unocal plans to halt production and remove 
all traces of the wells above ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Imle, who is a member of Unocal's board of directors, said he wished that 
employees had come to him long ago with reports of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, the message has been delivered loud and clear that employees 
must comply with reporting laws. "The standard today is, you spill a drop of 
diluent or anything else in that field and you tell somebody about it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to evidence compiled by the state oil spill agency, Imle's 
philosophy was not the rule from 1978 to 1993. In a report filed last week with 
the San Luis Obispo district attorney's office, Huckaby, the investigating 
agent, documented some of the efforts by Unocal employees to cover up spills. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, an employee named John Smith suggested installing a pump to collect 
diluent that was floating on top of the ground water in a shallow hole near the 
beach. His proposal was rejected by a foreman who told him: "We don't want 
anybody to know we know this is here," according to Huckaby's report. Shortly 
afterward, the foreman ordered the hole filled in. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith later became a key figure in the case after he called the state agency 
anonymously in 1992 to report that Unocal was attempting to cover up another 
major leak. His call led to a search warrant and raid of Unocal offices in 
which agents seized numerous company records and began to unravel the cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Another incident cited by Huckaby occurred in the winter of 1988, when diluent 
entered the ocean in such quantities that residents of the area complained of 
oil pollution at Guadalupe Beach, just south of the oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal took samples of the spilled oil and reported that it did not match 
diluent used at the field. The company suggested that the oil had come from a 
passing ship that discharged fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging that Unocal collected bogus samples, Huckaby wrote: "It is clear 
Unocal lied to or deliberately misled (local authorities) concerning the oil 
contamination to the beach and surf." 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the three months after this spill that Johannes, the animal 
rescue worker, recovered 72 dying or dead sea lions and seals, according to her 
records. She said she also found dead marine mammals after spills in 1989, 1990 
and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her repeated pleas, local authorities were unwilling to take on Unocal 
in the face of the company's denials, she said. Finally, she became so 
frustrated she turned in her federal permit for rescue work, saying she no 
longer wanted to be an accomplice to the oil company's pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was running around picking up animals for five years," Johannes said. "I'm 
very angry about it. They owe that money (court penalties) in a big way because 
they ignored the animals. They've been covering this up for years." Record 
Spills 
</P>
<P>
 The total volume of petroleum thinner spilled at the Guadalupe oil field ranks 
it as one of the largest oil spills in the nation. These are the top 10 
petroleum spills reported in the United States during the past 25 years: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1. The Corinthos, a ship carrying Algerian crude oil, was rammed by another 
ship while offloading oil in Pennsylvania's Delaware River in January, 1975. 
Thirty-eight people died. Total spill: 11.2 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 2. The Burmah Agate, a Liberian ship, exploded after colliding with another 
ship at the entrance to Galveston Harbor, Tex., in November, 1979. Total spill: 
10.7 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3. The Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in March, 
1989. Total spill: 10.1 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4. Petroleum thinner spilled at the Unocal oil field near Guadalupe, Calif., 
during hundreds of pipeline breaks and leaks over four decades of operations. 
Total spill: estimated up to 8.5 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 5. The Argo Merchant, a Liberian tanker, went aground near Nantucket, Mass., 
in December, 1976. Total spill: 7.7 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6. Waste oil and sludge spilled into the Schuylkill River, Pa., in June, 
1972, from a reclamation plant during floods from Hurricane Agnes. Total spill: 
7.1 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 7. An offshore oil well near Santa Barbara operated by Union Oil (now 
Unocal) blew out in January, 1969. Total spill: 4.2 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 8. Oil escaped during maintenance at the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 
Pa., in September, 1978. Total spill: 3 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 9. The tanker vessel Alvenus ran aground off Louisiana in July, 1984. Total 
spill: 2.7 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 10. A Chevron oil platform off Mississippi caught fire, spilling oil and 
gas, in February, 1970. Total spill: 2.7 million gallons.

AID CONVOY REACHES BOSNIA CITY AS SERBS LIFT BLOCKADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 U.N. relief workers brought food and medicine to the starving and devastated 
northern Bosnian town of Maglaj on Sunday, after Bosnian Serb gunmen abandoned 
a barricade from which they had been blocking humanitarian aid deliveries for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheering Bosnians, some in tears, lined Maglaj's streets as the convoy rolled 
in, according to news reports from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought this day would never come. We have suffered so much," said Sophia, 
a 55-year-old Muslim woman who could not hold back her tears. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. troops and aid workers confirmed their worst suspicions upon arrival in 
the ruined enclave where more than 100,000 Muslims had been surrounded and 
thrashed by artillery fire by both Serbian and Croatian nationalist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no buildings left in Maglaj," said Peter Kessler, the U.N. refugee 
agency's spokesman in Sarajevo, conveying reports from convoy drivers who 
described the town's devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. witnesses compared the destruction to that of the eastern Croatian 
town of Vukovar, where a three-month Serbian artillery bombardment in 1991 
flattened the suburban community into a moonscape of jagged ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine trucks loaded with 80 tons of food and other vital goods reached Maglaj 
in midafternoon. Three of the trucks traveled on to the nearby village of 
Tesanj. 
</P>
<P>
 North Atlantic Treaty Organization warplanes roared overhead, ready to strike 
in case of any moves by Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first ground convoy since Oct. 25 to get into the town, whose 
population has been swollen to five times its original size by Muslims driven 
out of surrounding villages. It was only the second aid delivery in nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. relief official who visited the desperate enclave two months ago 
reported widespread malnutrition and emaciated women and children. Some wore 
bandages covering wounds suffered while trying to retrieve air-dropped food 
parcels from surrounding woods that were booby-trapped with mines and raked by 
snipers. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors arriving with the convoy were to help the sick and wounded, Kessler 
said, and nine people were evacuated for further treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb gunmen loyal to nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic appeared 
to have fled the barricade south of Maglaj because they had become vulnerable 
to counterattack now that Bosnia's Muslims and Croats have reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslims and Croats, who account for two-thirds of Bosnia's 4.4 million prewar 
population, had initially fought together against the Serbian insurgency that 
began in April, 1992. But the erstwhile Bosnian allies took to fighting each 
other for what scraps of territory were left after Serbs had conquered 70% of 
Bosnia, and international mediators seemed resigned to an ethnic partitioning 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 State-controlled Croatian Radio reported that Serbs had begun pulling back 
from the Maglaj roadblock late Saturday, after Croatian forces that had earlier 
allowed them safe passage through Croat-held territory issued an ultimatum for 
the Serbs to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian nationalists had in some areas, such as Maglaj, suspended their 
conflict with the Serbs to allow the better-armed faction to pummel Muslim 
civilians in areas the Croats wanted to take for their own ethnically pure 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Croatian political leaders in Bosnia and in neighboring Croatia agreed 
March 1, under pressure from U.S. diplomats, to reconcile with the Muslims and 
give up aspirations of carving out a Croatian ministate within Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Croats have been promised economic assistance from the United 
States and other Western countries in exchange for their cooperation in efforts 
to rescue as much of Bosnia as possible for an emerging new federation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials concede privately that Bosnian Serbs are unlikely to join the 
union, making an ethnic partitioning inevitable. But they and other Western 
mediators contend that ethnic division and capitulation to the Serbs' land grab 
are preferable to more bloodshed.

COLUMN ONE; SAVING THE GLORY THAT WAS GREECE; IN ATHENS, DIGGING A SUBWAY VITAL 
TO THE SHABBY CITY'S FUTURE HAS UNEARTHED TREASURES FROM ITS PAST. DESPITE A 
GIANT RESCUE EFFORT, SOME FEAR THE ANCIENT TROVE WILL BE LOST IN THE PUSH TO 
KEEP THE METRO ON TRACK.

<P>
 Archeology has taken massively to the streets of Athens, combing through the 
splendid Greek past in search of a more livable future for a now-ramshackle 
capital literally gasping for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 The harvest is bountiful -- and bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of a $2.8-billion underground Metro for Athens is imposing a 
delicate and painful balance between the demands of modern urban life and the 
legacies of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Metro excavations have opened archeological digs the size of 22 football 
fields along major streets in the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Artifacts in dazzling array, from toys to sarcophagi to sexy bedroom lamps, 
are being recovered as part of the largest effort ever undertaken to mine and 
rescue the underground treasures of a metropolis whose majesty beckons across 
25 centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scale is indescribable. In pieces, there are hundreds of thousands. In 
bulk, tons. We are talking large trucks and heavy cranes," said William G. 
Stead, the American engineer overseeing Metro construction. "Scholars will be 
writing their theses on this material 25 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that large numbers of newly seen landmarks from Athens' past 
-- walls, foundations, wells, aqueducts -- will be bulldozed goodby in another 
few months to keep Metro construction on schedule. Not everybody is sure that 
there will be time to fully digest the trove. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent morning, a worker digging a few feet beneath street level near 
Syntagma, or Constitution Square, uncovered a broken pocketbook-sized 
terra-cotta brick bearing the image of two prancing panthers. Archeologist 
Costas Saris hustled over. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mold from a metal-working shop; about the time of Christ," he told a 
visitor above the rasp of a No. 136 bus trapped in traffic a few yards away on 
Amalias Avenue before the national Parliament. To the fury of motorists, the 
Metro digs have institutionalized gridlock since tunneling began in earnest in 
November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The panthers, duly documented, by now lie in one of the fast-growing artifact 
warehouses of the Greek Culture Ministry. They will be studied -- eventually. 
There is no time for that sort of scholarly luxury right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we don't excavate all year round, so winter offers a chance to study 
and to reflect. Here, we don't have that chance," said Saris, one of a dozen 
archeologists overseeing workers at what will become the Metro's biggest 
station. "A site this size would normally keep us busy for many years. But we 
have only six months. I wish we hadn't found so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Stead, who ran San Francisco's Municipal Railway for five years and also 
worked for New York and Boston transit systems, is himself a trained 
archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
 He sympathizes with the yearning to linger over the past. But time is money, 
in this case European money: about 1 million marks for every day of delay -- 
nearly $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slow archeology is not necessarily good, and fast archeology is not 
necessarily bad," said Stead, chief of a Bechtel International team providing 
management and engineering services to the Greek company responsible for the 
Metro. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally planned for completion in 1997, the project is already more than 
one year behind schedule because of the archeology. Now, Stead said, Athens 
must avoid the mistakes of Rome, where standoffs between builders and 
conservers repeatedly delayed subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, features like wells, walls and foundations will be destroyed. 
Once they are measured and recorded, we'll have to bulldoze them out of the 
way," Stead said. "But the glass is also half full. Except for the Metro, these 
sites would never have been excavated to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 That there is any excavation at all is because 80% of Metro financing comes 
from Greece's concerned partners in the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the largest contribution that the EU (formerly the EC) and the European 
Investment Bank have made to any single project. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it bluntly, their European partners -- like the Greeks themselves -- 
are alarmed at Athens' decay. 
</P>
<P>
 Classical Athens was the most wondrous city on Earth in the 5th Century BC. 
Modern Athens is the most polluted and choked capital in the EU, 12th of 12 in 
livability and efficiency, by most reckoning. Greeks believe that it is time 
the past moved over to make room for regeneration. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncounted false Metro starts across 30 years of explosive urbanization have 
left Athenians disbelieving that anything good could ever emerge from any new 
hole in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most people tell pollsters that while they do not want archeology 
sacrificed for the Metro, neither do they want the Metro sidetracked by 
archeology. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not hard to understand why. In 1961, there were 39,000 cars in Athens, 
where a third of Greeks live. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are 1.4 million cars in a metropolitan area with almost 3.5 
million people. Despite Draconian traffic restrictions, little moves downtown 
in the historic, commercial, financial and governmental heart of Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 A century ago, a wide-eyed Mark Twain could see the Acropolis from his ship 
docked at the port of Piraeus, five miles away. Today, just peering across the 
street can be an eye-searing event. A noxious smog damages people and monuments 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece was mortified to have been bypassed as the site of the 1996 centennial 
Olympic Games, but anybody who has navigated the streets of Athens -- or tried 
to use the telephones -- understands why. 
</P>
<P>
 Metro to the rescue: Planners say that by century's end it could be carrying 
450,000 passengers a day, reducing daily auto trips by 250,000 and the city's 
exhaust pollution by 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Metro is an environment and quality-of-life issue," Stead said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-mile, 21-station, two-line underground will link with the upgraded 
version of an existing surface line that runs from Piraeus to the northern 
suburb of Kifisia. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners promise the result will improve not only capital life, but also the 
international image of a city that now leaves tourist hordes as 
transport-despairing as Athenians. A functioning Metro system, who knows, might 
even restore credibility in government -- customarily as hard to encounter here 
as a parking space. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of skepticism. But even with fences two feet from buildings and 
businesses, I think we are gradually winning public acceptance for the idea of 
short-term pain for long-term gain," said William G. Margaritis, a Greek 
American spokesman for the project and one of 26 Bechtel employees representing 
the Greek client Attiko Metro before a construction consortium of 25 Greek, 
French and German companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine any other issue on which there could be a political 
consensus to allow major thoroughfares to be dug up for long periods of time," 
Margaritis said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the need for the Metro is persuasive, so is the case for preserving a 
legacy of history that belongs not just to Greece but to all of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-sought underground railroad, one of the largest public works projects 
now under way in Europe, will include five stations within the walls of ancient 
Athens, some of them in the shadow of the Acropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 It is some of the most fertile soil for archeology on Earth: One trench 
surrendered a neolithic obsidian blade at its bottom and a 1920s coin near its 
top -- the detritus of 7,000 years in 15 vertical feet. In all, about 767,000 
square feet of city streets are being systematically laid bare for 
archeological scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The digs are very important for understanding the history and topography of 
the city. But we didn't expect to find material in such good condition right 
under the street pavement," said Olga Zachariadou, supervising archeologist for 
the Greek Ministry of Culture. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent morning, 100 workers with shovels backed by a dozen archeologists 
with fine brushes pored over the site at Syntagma, where two Metro lines will 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely the Syntagma archeology that is delaying construction. Despite 
detailed research with sources ranging from ancient travelers' journals to old 
city maps, test trenches and ground-penetrating radar, archeologists are 
finding the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "This site was a cemetery outside the walls of the classical city beginning 
around the 4th Century BC. Later, it was incorporated inside the much larger 
Roman city. We found ruins of two metalworking shops we had no idea existed," 
Zachariadou said. "A big Roman bath was built here under the Emperor Hadrian 
(AD 117-138) that lasted until the 5th or 6th Century. Above that are some 
ruins of Byzantine Greece." 
</P>
<P>
 There was great slaughter amid much destruction when the Roman general Sulla 
conquered the city in 86 BC. And as the wellspring of Western civilization, 
Athens has been subsequently pawed by vandals and enthusiasts alike. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, much of what is being uncovered now was disturbed long ago. A lot 
of the artifact pieces are just that. But some of the finds have been fresh, 
surprising and of museum quality. 
</P>
<P>
 One sealed tomb contained the 2,000-year-old remains of a young boy and the 
toys laid to rest with him. At the Pentagono station, a marble sarcophagus the 
size of a conference table protected a 20-something woman and myriad vials left 
by her mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 One round, stone room for which there was no obvious entrance held never-used 
marble tabletops and at least 100 terra-cotta oil lamps in mint condition, each 
painted with erotic scenes, Stead said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Larissa station, archeologists discovered a Roman drain. Elsewhere, 
they are engrossed in newly visible city walls, workshops, aqueducts, cisterns, 
ancient roads and the bed of a dried-up river. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the artifacts being stockpiled for Culture Ministry safekeeping are 
many bulky architectural features: chunks of wall and aqueduct, a 
nine-foot-tall stone storage jar prized out of the digs by cranes. Some of the 
fragments will go back underground as displays in new Metro stations. 
</P>
<P>
 While the stations, de facto, need access to the surface, the tunnels between 
them will be dug in bedrock around 60 feet deep to avoid disturbing whatever 
lies above. Workers manipulating huge, jet-engine-shaped mechanical diggers 
will use boring techniques perfected in construction of the "Chunnel" that 
connects Britain and France under the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 To minimize damage to known archeological sites, several stations -- Olympion, 
Monastiraki and Akademia -- will be built by underground tunneling rather than 
surface excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, though, many features will be destroyed, particularly at Syntagma, 
the system's only two-level station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every station hides its own secrets . . . baths, a market, the ruins of a 
Byzantine church at Monastiraki. In some stations we can move things slightly 
to preserve archeological features, but here at Syntagma a lot will be lost," 
Zachariadou said. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not one to vouchsafe Athens' thirst for better transportation, or the 
need to keep Metro construction moving. Still, Zachariadou said, on the day 
this spring when the bulldozers come to Syntagma, she intends to be far, far 
away.

SPIELBERG'S CREATIVITY MAY BE GETTING A NEW FOCUS; ENTERTAINMENT: EXPANSION 
INTO HIGH-TECH VENTURES IS A POSSIBILITY. DEAL-MAKING COULD ECLIPSE FILMMAKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After creating dinosaurs real enough to scare up nearly $1 billion at the box 
office with "Jurassic Park" and a wrenchingly real-to-life vision of the 
Holocaust with "Schindler's List," what's next for Steven Spielberg? The answer 
could be "Let's Make a Deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old director/producer, who is expected to sweep tonight's Academy 
Awards for "Schindler," has signaled that he may temporarily shift his 
attention from filmmaking to deal-making in the coming year as he takes a 
well-publicized directing sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg has always been ambivalent about the pure business side of the 
business -- even as he has amassed vast personal wealth from a string of hits 
stretching from "Jaws" to "Jurassic Park." But sources say he finally appears 
ready to take advantage of opportunities to expand Amblin Entertainment, the 
company that has served as his base for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Creative Artists Agency, the Hollywood talent firm that represents Spielberg, 
is in discussions with top technology companies over a number of business 
ventures that would move him swiftly onto the information superhighway. Sources 
say that Spielberg, who is personally close to CAA's deal-making chairman, 
Michael S. Ovitz, sees much of his future in interactive technology, computer 
games and other forms of "alternative" entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had discussions about all of that," one associate said. "But he's not 
thinking about anything now except the Academy Awards, and he won't focus on 
this for several months." 
</P>
<P>
 New technology would be a natural progression for Spielberg, who has always 
operated on the cutting edge of special effects in movies and television, and 
who is technically proficient enough to play video games over long-distance 
phone lines with actor/comedian Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The director, who is responsible for four of the top 10 movies of all time, is 
mum on the question, though friends say he is intrigued by the idea of 
reinventing himself as a New Age entertainment/technology guru, after 
overseeing video game spinoffs of his movies. At Amblin, which is housed in a 
Southwestern-style complex on the MCA/Universal Pictures lot, plans are under 
way to consolidate Amblin/Universal's London-based animation group, 
Amblimation, with the rest of Spielberg's Los Angeles operations as part of the 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the big question on many industry executives' minds is whether Spielberg 
has the same will to direct a broad-based entertainment empire as movies. The 
prevailing view in Hollywood is that Amblin operates more as an outlet for 
Spielberg's personal creative impulses than a traditional business. That has 
served the company well in the film arena, where Spielberg lavishes most of his 
attention. But the company is considered an underachiever in other media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven tends to obsess over one project at a time," one associate said. 
"That's a great quality in an artist, but not such a good quality if you're 
running a company." 
</P>
<P>
 One example of that is feature animation, where Amblin was seen as a threat to 
Walt Disney Co.'s hegemony in the 1980s, after producing "An American Tail" and 
"The Land Before Time" for Universal Pictures. Amblin was also behind "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit," which became a major hit for Disney. But lately it has 
had trouble duplicating that success. 
</P>
<P>
 Amblin's most recent release was "We're Back," a dinosaur tale that quickly 
became extinct despite its shared pedigree with "Jurassic Park." After being 
blasted by critics, it took in only $9 million at the box office last fall. The 
explanation from Hollywood insiders: Spielberg was too busy working on 
"Jurassic" and "Schindler's" to supervise it. 
</P>
<P>
 Amblin has had more success in TV animation, with "Tiny Toons" and 
"Animaniacs" on the Fox network. At Warner Bros., which distributes both 
programs, President Terry Semel said those cartoons alone qualify Spielberg as 
a major animation force. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has two of the most successful animated shows on the air ever, two 
Emmy-award-winning and financially successful shows," Semel said. "He helped 
create all these characters and is actively involved in every episode and all 
the marketing and merchandising of the product that has come about." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Spielberg can lay claim to the hearts and minds of kiddie cartoon 
watchers everywhere, he is still searching for that same level of acceptance in 
prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 Amblin's latest launch, "seaQuest DSV," ranked 78th in the most recent Nielsen 
ratings. In its Sunday time slot, it is in fourth place behind CBS' "Murder, 
She Wrote," ABC's "The Adventures of Lois and Clark," and Fox's "Martin/Living 
Single" combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry analysts also see disturbing similarities to "Amazing Stories," 
the ambitious but unsuccessful Amblin anthology series that ran on NBC in the 
1980s. In both instances, they say Spielberg may have miscalculated the tastes 
of the viewing audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incredible success he has had in features is unique and it hasn't 
happened in the TV world, at least as yet, probably because of cost 
considerations and in a sense, the audience is different than his core audience 
in the feature world," said Kenneth Ziffren, one of Hollywood's leading 
attorneys. "His successful pictures are selling to the 12-to-24 or 
12-to-34-year-olds and that's not the bulk of the core TV network audience 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Tartikoff, who headed entertainment at NBC when "Amazing Stories" 
aired, said he was awe-struck by Spielberg's story-crafting. But, like many 
people who have worked with Amblin, Tartikoff said the magic often disappeared 
when Spielberg delegated. "This is a business where you've got to have not just 
great chiefs, but great Indians," Tartikoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amblin's staff of 60 is unlike most others in Hollywood. From the start, 
Spielberg has surrounded himself almost entirely with creative people instead 
of business executives. On the positive side, that has made Amblin more nimble 
than many competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment attorney Linda Lichter said: "I think dealing with Amblin is 
much better than dealing with the studios because the chain of command is 
shorter. People obviously have to check with Steven on creative issues like 
hiring a director or writer, but Amblin likes to have its own creative controls 
and the studios don't look to overrule them." 
</P>
<P>
 The creative hothouse environment at Amblin has also spawned a lot of fresh 
talent, said David Kanter, a motion picture agent at United Talent Agency. 
"Steven has championed a number of young writers and directors," Kanter said. 
"When he's in town and focused, he gets extremely involved. He's not an 
absentee producer. He develops personal relationships with people he wants to 
work with. His seal of approval is extremely important in this town." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the filmmakers Spielberg has helped launch are Robert Zemeckis of "Back 
to the Future" fame, director Chris Columbus of "Home Alone," Kevin Reynolds, 
whose film "Fandango" was a first starring role for Kevin Costner, and director 
Phil Joanou. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, critics say that Amblin's unconventional structure encourages 
cult-like devotion to Spielberg, rather than Hollywood's usual creative give 
and take. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very dysfunctional place emotionally because Steven is perceived as a 
deity," said one former employee who asked not to be identified, partly on 
grounds that all Amblin workers are required to sign lifelong confidentiality 
agreements. "He's not really the head of a company, he's sort of god. He's 
protected at all turns from everything that will be unpleasant. The line you 
walk there is you never bring anything unpleasant to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got there, someone said: 'Steven is the company, don't ever forget 
that,' " the former Amblin executive added. "It's not like a regular working 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Most people agree that former Amblin president Kathleen Kennedy was the only 
person who consistently stood up to Spielberg. She and her husband, Frank 
Marshall, ran Amblin until last year, when they left to form a production 
company at Paramount Pictures. Neither returned repeated calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, another husband-and-wife team will replace them. Writer-producer 
Walter Parkes has been hired as president of Amblin's movie division, and 
producer Laurie MacDonald will serve as executive vice president. But even in 
light of Amblin's likely forays into the high-tech arena, Parkes and MacDonald 
said they are committed to keeping the company close to its roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amblin has been a filmmaker enterprise historically, that has been the key to 
its success," Parkes said. "Steven and I have had no specific talks, but I get 
the impression he's looked at certain (high-tech) companies. . . . The real 
challenge is going to be to help focus on the most essential thing -- the 
creative impulse that flows into these new business opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Creativity versus commerce. That has always been the key issue in discussions 
over Spielberg's future, and there is no reason to believe that will change. 
Sources say he receives counsel from a close circle of associates that includes 
Ovitz, MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg; his manager, Gerald Breslauer, and 
his lawyer, Bruce Ramer. Ultimately, however, Spielberg tends to follow his own 
instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past that has meant maintaining the status quo, despite countless 
opportunities to grow his business beyond its core base of movies, TV, video 
and merchandising. A few years ago, Spielberg and director Martin Scorsese 
considered launching a low-budget film company called Red Shoes. The idea, 
sources said, was to make independent, filmmaker-driven movies that might be 
too offbeat for the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg and Scorsese spoke to various Japanese investors but were 
unsuccessful in raising money, supposedly because neither was willing to make a 
total commitment to be involved creatively with the projects. One source close 
to the talks said Spielberg -- who is accustomed to others financing his dreams 
-- balked at the idea of having to pay $200,000 to put together a business plan 
for the company, which died after three months of discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 On the financial side, Spielberg has declined offers to take Amblin public, 
even though Wall Street sources said he could easily raise half a billion 
dollars, based on his name alone. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that Spielberg has access to more than enough cash needed to 
finance his assorted projects. He has worked all over Hollywood, but is closest 
to MCA/Universal and Warner Bros. Universal Pictures Chairman Tom Pollock said 
Spielberg has the clout to make whatever he wants, though Universal also brings 
certain projects to his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's always had this thing about focusing on the projects, not 
focusing on the machine," one source said. "He's used Universal and Warner to 
basically be his machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends point to that as a prime example of Spielberg's business savvy, which 
is sometimes overlooked in stories focusing on the goofy man-child image of the 
director. Spielberg has helped perpetuate that image by saying things like: 
"I'm not really interested in making money. That's always come as a result of 
success, but it's not been my goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg is partnered with him in the 
restaurant DIVE!, which they plan to take national after the first one opens in 
May in Century City. Asked about Spielberg's financial prowess, Katzenberg 
laughed and said: "Give me a break, the guy's a killer. He's as smart as 
anyone, and he understands the business as well as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 That is borne out in Hollywood deal meetings, where sources say Spielberg has 
the unsettling ability to segue from boyish yarn-spinner to flinty negotiator. 
Knowledgeable executives said he receives $1 million to $1.5 million against a 
small piece of initial gross receipts on his movies. Once a studio has recouped 
its production costs and earned a low distribution fee, Spielberg's overall 
take of the net receipts is said to skyrocket to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 One former negotiator said: "I think he's a son-of-a-bitch business-wise. 
George Lucas is the same way. They have a huge amount of leverage, so they can 
make tough deals." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's tough negotiating stance and occasional brusqueness have created a 
certain level of hostility toward him within his industry. But Warner's Semel 
said he is worth the money. "In general, it's fair to say, both as director and 
producer, his deal is commensurate with his success. He has a very good deal. 
If you're up there as one of the best, as Steven is the best, he'd be a fool 
not to be compensated as the very best." 
</P>
<P>
 Although few people know his precise worth, it is believed to be in excess of 
$500 million. Friends are fond of pointing out that Spielberg will continue to 
make more money than most Hollywood heavyweights, whether he expands his 
business or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet keeping people guessing about his next moves has always been part of 
Spielberg's magic. For the near term at least, Amblin continues to churn out 
highly commercial entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Flintstones," which is in post-production, is being touted as Universal's 
big summer movie. Still before the cameras are "The Little Rascals" and 
"Casper." "Little Giants" starts next month. Another project, which bears the 
title, "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar," goes into production 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Amblin is also taking another swing at feature animation with "Balto," the 
story of an Alaskan dog that saves lives. "Tiny Toons," "Animaniacs" and 
"seaQuest" are cranking away. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA's Sheinberg, who has served as a mentor to Spielberg for more than a 
quarter of a century, said he expects the director to remain intimately 
involved with Amblin, even during his sabbatical. He recalled driving onto the 
Universal lot just two days after the Jan. 17 earthquake, and finding Spielberg 
busily inspecting the damage to his sets and building. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheinberg would not speculate on where Amblin goes from here, but said its 
future is secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can do whatever he wants with Amblin," Sheinberg said. "The test should 
always be, does it work for Steven?"

LITTLE SAIGON GETS A BIG VOICE; RADIO: NINE MONTHS AGO, PLANS FOR FULL-TIME 
VIETNAMESE BROADCASTING SOUNDED LIKE A LONG SHOT. TODAY, DESPITE SOME CRITICS, 
KWIZ-FM IS AN INSTITUTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Trang Nguyen, president of Little Saigon Radio Broadcasting, barely had time 
to sit down at her desk Tuesday morning before her phone started ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not stop for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Early reports had just hit the news about the Vietnamese American man who had 
gone on a shooting rampage at a Santa Fe Springs electronic plant the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's Vietnamese-speaking listeners wanted to know if the station could 
tell them more about Tuan Nguyen, the Orange County man who had killed three 
people and then himself. Reporters from mainstream media also were on the line, 
asking if Little Saigon Radio could provide additional information for their 
own coverage. Even tearful relatives and friends of the victims called in, 
seeking advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it has been on the air for a mere nine months, Little Saigon Radio has 
become an influential voice in Vietnamese American affairs throughout Southern 
California at a time when debate over U.S.-Hanoi relations has intensified 
here. The station provides news, a platform for debates on controversial issues 
and community service information. 
</P>
<P>
 Its emerging, multifaceted role was not planned by station founders when the 
idea of the first extensive Vietnamese-language daily broadcast in Southern 
California was bandied about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a bold move to start a daylong radio program, especially since 
other, shorter Asian-language programs on the radio at the time were not very 
successful," said Nghia Tran, executive director of the Vietnamese Community of 
Orange County, a nonprofit social service organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, like many others in the expatriate community, had politely dismissed the 
program's chances of success when Trang Nguyen initially asked his opinion 
about the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow, against all odds, it has become an institution, a medium which 
Vietnamese -- those who are not acculturated as well as those who are fluent in 
English -- can turn to for help and information," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroll through almost any store in Little Saigon during business hours any day 
of the week, and chances are that, if the radio is on, it is tuned to KWIZ-FM 
(96.7). Broadcast entirely in Vietnamese, the program features music, 
commentaries, talk shows and news -- local, state, national and international. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the station supplies news that Vietnamese Americans in Orange 
and Los Angeles counties usually cannot find or understand in the 
English-language media. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of need for information in the Vietnamese community, and 
people trust us," Nguyen said. "We're journalists. We're professionals. But our 
listeners also know that we want to extend our hands instead of just doing a 
job. It's not a cliche: We are a community service." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics charge that the programming at times displays an anti-Communist 
bias in its coverage of Vietnam and the local community. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Co Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, who has received 
death threats for supporting the normalization of diplomatic ties between the 
United States and Vietnam, cited as an example a demonstration in front of his 
office in September -- the first major story broadcast by the station since it 
began airing July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest began with one man staging a hunger strike in the parking lot of 
Pham's Westminster practice. Over two days, it grew into a crowd of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham alleges, and some in the community privately concur, that by allowing 
demonstrators to get on the airwaves to ask for participants, Little Saigon 
Radio unduly helped fan the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were only a few hundred anti-Communist protesters at my office several 
months ago, but they said on the air there were several thousand," Co recalled. 
"Then their announcer urged listeners to go join the protest. So several hours 
later there were several thousand people. That's irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon Radio said it was merely doing its job by reporting the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Viet Dzung, the morning disc jockey who broadcast the event live, denied he 
encouraged listeners to protest. But "even if I did," Dzung said, "if Dr. Co is 
in the right, if what he does is for the good of the community and not his own, 
then I could have screamed my lungs out for people to show up and protest and 
no one would have come." 
</P>
<P>
 His boss, Nguyen, is just as unabashed. She and other board members of the 
private corporation were disappointed, she said, when President Clinton ended 
economic sanctions against Vietnam last month, allowing the two former enemies 
to conduct business. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the months to come, while the U.S. government mulls over whether to 
renew diplomatic ties with Vietnam, Nguyen said, the station's broadcasters 
will continue to say normalization should occur only when human rights and 
democracy for the Vietnamese are restored. 
</P>
<P>
 But the broadcasters also will invite those who support normalized relations 
onto the program to present the other side, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen pointed out that in the interests of balance, the station has been 
willing to risk losing advertisers who oppose the ending of economic sanctions. 
The program last year interviewed Nghia Nguyen, an economist who works for the 
World Bank and who favors the lifting of the embargo. After that interview, 
station employees fielded calls and letters from angry anti-Communist callers, 
some threatening to bomb the station, Trang Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not have supported (the economist's) viewpoint," she said, "but we 
were not going to suppress it either." 
</P>
<P>
 The station "can't tell the listeners what to think about anything," Nguyen 
said. "They will make their own decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Other criticisms of Little Saigon Radio have less to do with station's 
politics than with the broadcasters' ethnocentric approach. 
</P>
<P>
 A few Vietnamese American followers of the station say broadcasters seem to 
promote ethnic elitism during the morning and afternoon drive-time talk-shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics cited the closing comments last week by Viet Dzung after an on-the-air 
interview with a witness to the Santa Fe Springs shootings. During his address 
to the listeners, asking Vietnamese to unite in the aftermath of the tragedy, 
the disc jockey labeled mainstream media coverage of the shooting as "distant, 
cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the broadcasters' practice of complimenting the audience and many 
of the guest speakers, said Yen Do, editor of the Westminster-based Nguoi Viet 
Daily newspaper, "the listeners get this image that our community is all good 
and we're the victims of the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
 But for every critic, the owners of Little Saigon Radio said, there are 
thousands of listeners who value their program and the community voice it has 
indisputably become. 
</P>
<P>
 When the station began airing, the corporation formed by Nguyen and three 
partners had attracted only five advertising accounts after weeks of 
soliciting. Three weeks into the program, the station filled all its 
advertising air time. It now has about 200 advertisers, and new accounts are 
lining up every day, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost the partners, including Nguyen's husband, $150,000 to launch the 
station. They had hoped to be in the black within six months; they reached that 
goal in three months. Nguyen declined to discuss the station's profitability 
because of future potential competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The program began with nine hours of daily air time, Monday through Friday. 
Today, it broadcasts from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lessens the stress of homesickness in our community," Co Pham said. Do, 
the editor, said: "Now, any time people have questions or comments, they call 
up the station." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the case for Chi Pham of Garden Grove, whose fiance, Chin Nguyen, was 
one of the three people shot to death last week at Extron Electronics in Santa 
Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the shooting, when official information was still scant, she 
frantically called Little Saigon Radio for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's going on," she tearfully told Trang Nguyen in Vietnamese. 
"Please help me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen told Pham what the station knew and helped calm her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know who else I could trust to give me some information," Pham said 
later. "The radio was my only link."

TEACHERS ASSN. IS NEUTRAL ON PRIMARY RACE FOR GOVERNOR; POLITICS: NEITHER BROWN 
NOR GARAMENDI WINS 60% OF DELEGATE VOTES IN THE STATE'S LARGEST EDUCATORS 
UNION. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER NONETHELESS VIEWS THE VOTE AS A VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 Providing an unexpectedly ambiguous end to a weekend marked by relentless 
lobbying, the California Teachers Assn., the state's largest teachers union, 
announced Sunday that it will not endorse a candidate in the June 7 
gubernatorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise announcement came after CTA delegates twice split their votes 
between state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi. In a first ballot Saturday and then in a runoff on Sunday, neither 
candidate won 60% of delegates' support -- the threshold required for 
endorsement under union rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The standoff was widely perceived as a victory for Garamendi, who is running 
behind Brown in the polls. Many had expected Brown, a former Los Angeles school 
board member, to win the endorsement of the union despite her differences with 
the rank and file, some who resented her support of the breakup of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District and her support of charter schools, in which 
parents, teachers and community leaders customize each school's curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 532 ballots cast in Sunday's runoff, Brown received 288 votes, 
Garamendi 244. At least 320 votes were required to win the endorsement of the 
union, which represents 230,000 public school teachers and is among the largest 
fund-raising organizations in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Reese, Brown's campaign spokesman, put a positive spin on the CTA's 
decision, noting that although Brown did not win the endorsement, she did 
receive the recommendation of the CTA's 24-member board of directors, which 
formally urged its 660 delegates to vote for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was always going to be a very difficult endorsement for us to win, with 
the 60% threshold. That she won the (board's) recommendation was a victory all 
on its own," he said. Asked to explain the outcome, he said: "Garamendi is a 
master at pandering. He was lock-step with their issues. No questions asked." 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, countered: "Being in sync with the 
views of the electorate may be pandering with Kathleen Brown. It just happens 
to be where John Garamendi is." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow said he was "thrilled" with the CTA's decision, which he considers "a 
win." Noting that Garamendi has received the endorsement of the California 
Federation of Teachers, which has 40,000 members, Sragow said:"John Garamendi 
is the only candidate for governor who has been endorsed by teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the CTA failed to endorse in a primary for governor was in 1974, 
when the leading Democratic candidate was Brown's brother, Jerry. After Jerry 
Brown won the primary, the CTA endorsed him against Republican Atty. Gen. 
Evelle Younger. 
</P>
<P>
 The CTA's delegate assembly will meet again after the June primary to consider 
endorsing a gubernatorial candidate in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's runoff capped a tumultuous weekend during which both campaigns vied 
aggressively for CTA support. Garamendi's campaign, expecting a Brown victory, 
went on the offensive Saturday, faxing to reporters complaints that the 
endorsement process had been tainted by what Sragow called a conflict of 
interest -- a supposed business connection between one CTA official and the 
Brown campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 CTA officials denied that Brown received any special treatment. Brown campaign 
staffers called the suggestion of conflict of interest insulting. It is 
unlikely that the implications had any impact because they did not reach most 
delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday morning, the contest seemed so close that Brown and Garamendi took 
the unusual step of dropping by the Los Angeles hotel where the CTA was meeting 
to shake delegates' hands one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's very unusual," said Ned Hopkins, an associate executive director of 
the CTA. "Candidates usually stay away." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins called the failure to endorse a surprise, and he attributed the close 
vote in part to Garamendi's tough campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Garamendi made a wonderful impression at a candidates forum we had in 
January. . . . He was articulate, right on the issues, and really made a 
favorable impression. Most people thought he had won that debate," said 
Hopkins, who noted that most CTA delegates later received Garamendi campaign 
mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the weekend, he noted, delegates were greeted by Garamendi campaign 
literature on their chairs. On Sunday morning, the candidate himself appeared 
-- more than an hour before Brown showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was there right at 9 o'clock when the session began. She came at 10:30," 
Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CTA delegates did endorse several candidates, including: Controller Gray 
Davis for lieutenant governor, Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) for 
attorney general, Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose) for controller, former 
California Democratic Party Chairman Phil Angelides for treasurer, 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) for secretary of state and 
Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont) for superintendent of public 
instruction.

NEWS ANALYSIS; RAPIST'S RELEASE SHAKES UP GOVERNOR'S RACE; CAMPAIGN: WILSON IS 
TAKING HEAT EVEN THOUGH HE ADVOCATES LIFE TERMS FOR SUCH CRIMINALS. THE OUTCRY 
THREATENS HIS BEST POLITICAL WEAPON -- A REPUTATION OF BEING TOUGH ON CRIME. 
</P>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who built his political career advocating laws to lock up 
criminals for longer terms, now finds himself the object of considerable scorn 
over the release of just the sort of person he has said should be put away 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican governor has been assailed by a Democratic challenger, 
criticized by Bay Area residents and ripped by law enforcement officials in 
Modoc County, the rural outpost that the state decided should be the new home 
for Melvin A. Carter, a serial rapist who has confessed to assaulting more than 
100 women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson's name is mud around here right now," said Alturas Police Chief 
Larry Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
 After absorbing the equivalent of a political clubbing, Wilson might be 
forgiven for posing the question that figure skater Nancy Kerrigan made famous 
a few weeks ago: "Why me?" 
</P>
<P>
 For it was Wilson who, three days after taking office in 1991, deplored the 
state's short prison terms for rapists and proposed legislation to triple their 
time behind bars. Since then he repeatedly, and unsuccessfully, has urged 
Democratic lawmakers to lengthen those sentences and to curtail the kind of 
good-time credits that enabled Carter to slice his 25-year prison term in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's aides and political strategists hope to turn the anger at the 
governor into energy that will help him gain passage of the so-called "one 
strike" bill that would imprison first-time rapists and child molesters for 
life without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 They note that the "three strikes and you're out" sentencing bill Wilson 
signed this month was moribund in the Legislature until 12-year-old Polly Klaas 
was kidnaped and murdered in Petaluma last year. They think that the Carter 
case and that of a Southern California serial rapist whose term also is ending 
could be just the push the rape sentencing bill needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the meantime, they are faced with trying to limit political damage to 
Wilson from an issue that historically has been his best weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wilson responds, he risks sounding weak if he complains, accurately, that 
his hands are tied and that he has no choice but to release Carter. He risks 
sounding whiny if he complains, truthfully, that the Legislature would not pass 
his proposals. He risks offending rural voters if he suggests that the urban 
areas' worst criminals should be released in remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wilson, whose strategists believe can win reelection if he brings back 
into his fold Republican women who have turned away from him in many polls, 
must find a way to sound tougher and more sympathetic on the rape issue than 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate most eager to 
challenge him on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown helped set off the political storm last week when she criticized Wilson 
for allowing the release of Carter, 49, who was convicted in 1982 of raping 12 
women in Palo Alto, Berkeley and other Bay Area college towns. Sentenced to 25 
years in prison, Carter was released after 12 years because of credits for good 
behavior and his willingness to work while behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 As Carter's release date neared, a Bay Area newspaper publicized the case, 
setting off an uproar in Hayward, where prison officials had hoped to place 
him. Brown said that Wilson and the Department of Corrections had fumbled a 
chance to keep Carter locked up for two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson responded immediately with evidence that undercut Brown's charge, and 
political consultants and pundits concluded that he had effectively snuffed the 
controversy and gained the upper hand by making Brown appear unprepared and 
irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then the matter has continued to escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is now getting heat not only for releasing Carter -- an action he could 
not prevent -- but for his choice of Modoc County as host to the notorious 
criminal. The suspicion in Alturas is that Wilson chose their county after 
doing a bit of political calculus and realizing that he had much more to lose 
by sending Carter back to his populous Bay Area home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognize that the reason they're releasing this guy is because of laws 
passed long before Wilson took office," said Assemblyman Bernie Richter, a 
Chico Republican who represents the area. "I don't blame him for those laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't just thrust the Hitler of all rapists on this small community 
of good, hard-working people. The people here feel violated, used and dumped 
on. They're loyal Republicans, and they feel betrayed, like they've been the 
victim of a political rape." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Pickett said Wilson has alienated his traditional allies in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you," Pickett said, "Pete Wilson is gone. I voted for him. The 
sheriff voted for him. But we sure as hell won't support him in the future. He 
made this a dumping ground for dangerous parolees." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Alturas believe there is some simple math behind Wilson's 
decision: The discontent of 10,000 registered voters in the state's isolated, 
northeastern corner means little in a governor's race playing out in front of 
14 million registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark DiCamillo, an assistant to veteran pollster Mervin Field, said Wilson's 
long record on crime issues should insulate him from any significant widespread 
defections over the release of Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a thorny issue for the governor and it will probably cause some minor 
damage in the short term," DiCamillo said. "But I don't think the governor is 
vulnerable on the issue of crime. He has shown himself to be as tough as he 
possibly can be on criminal justice." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Democratic candidates, particularly Brown, are intent on trying to 
undercut Wilson's perceived advantage on the crime issue. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brown has been quiet about the Carter case since she leveled her 
original attack, her campaign spokesman said that the treasurer believes Wilson 
can be held accountable for failing to win legislative approval for longer rape 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a governor who will always blame somebody for his failures; in this 
case he's going to blame the Legislature," said Michael Reese, Brown's press 
secretary. "This state needs stronger leadership and not just election-year 
leadership. That's what has been missing in this Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said Brown supports lengthening the sentences for rape but opposes the 
"one-strike" bill because she believes it may discourage rape prosecutions. She 
has not put forward another specific proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign spokesman, said the public outcry over the 
Carter case was fed in part by what he called a "massive campaign of 
misinformation" by Brown that he predicted will backfire on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a technique that historically has worked in the short run," Schnur said. 
"But it's never worked in the long run. Eventually, the facts catch up with 
you."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: PETE (GIVE 'EM HELL) WILSON STRIKES BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has been reading a lot of newspaper commentary about the new 
"three strikes" law that he signed. He also has seen TV reports. All this 
coverage has made such an impression that he's been lifting some of the 
material -- and giving it a different flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The media critiquing and carping about the life sentences being too costly, 
ineffective and Draconian have inspired the governor's sardonic side -- and 
also his use of the word "hell." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he was telling the California Peace Officers Assn. last week 
about the man he'd read about who was charged with mugging a drifter for 50 
cents on Los Angeles' Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "The editorial writers, the pundits are claiming this thug is a victim of a 
misguided law," the governor said. "The 'victim' has a rap sheet that is 52 
pages long -- 52. It includes convictions for manslaughter and kidnaping and 
now he's mugged a homeless man. He's looking at life in prison for assault and 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critics say that's proof of everything that is wrong with the 'three 
strikes' law. Well, the hell with that. I say it's proof of everything that's 
right with 'three strikes.' This is exactly the kind of incorrigible career 
criminal that we should go after." 
</P>
<P>
 And the governor added, mockingly: "The public defender says (her) client is 
-- quote -- 'very, very upset.' (Pause for laughs.) You know, I believe that. I 
hope he is. That was the whole idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also told about the TV interview of a man who had served time for 
manslaughter and now was awaiting trial for armed robbery. "He said his fellow 
inmates don't like the new California crackdown," Wilson reported. "This is a 
quote: 'A lot of 'em are talking about going out of state.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You know something, I find that far more persuasive than many of the pundits. 
. . . I'm convinced that the new crackdowns are, in fact, persuading (this 
inmate) and his pals that they ought to think about doing business elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson says the Legislature shouldn't be satisfied with just passing the 
"three strikes" law. "To hell with that, too," he told the peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other tough measures, the governor is pushing a "one strike" bill to 
require life in prison without possibility of parole for first-time violent 
child molesters and rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 March into the legislative halls, he admonished the officers, "and politely 
raise as much hell as you need to in order to bring about change." 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature already has felt plenty of hell-raising for one session -- 
from Mike Reynolds, whose murdered daughter motivated him to sponsor the "three 
strikes" initiative; from Mark Klaas, father of murdered Polly; from radio talk 
shows, and the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democratic politicians also are feeling the heat from Republicans who 
have glommed onto Reynolds' "three-strikes" ballot initiative and are grasping 
to make it an issue in the November election. The initiative is identical to 
the bill Wilson just signed and thus is redundant. But one would never know 
that from listening to the likes of Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), 
who is using the ballot measure as the cornerstone of his U.S. Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the antsy Legislature, Democrats privately are debating whether to 
completely walk away from the "three strikes" issue -- since they've already 
succumbed to public pressure and passed the bill -- or to offer an alternative 
on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Any alternative would target only so-called serious or violent felons for 
"three strikes and you're out." Unlike the Reynolds measure, such criminals as 
car thieves and store burglars would not be locked up for 25 years to life. 
Therefore, the state would save billions in prison costs -- money that could be 
spent on crime prevention and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by the District Attorneys Assn., new Senate Leader Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward) is gingerly trying to determine if there's support for a compromise 
alternative. But Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) wants none of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Reynolds is not going to run me out there on that tree," the Speaker 
says. "I don't think Mr. Reynolds and his crowd (of Republicans) are going to 
be able to benefit from the 'three strikes' measure on the November ballot 
unless we give them a reason to." 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus is that without Wilson's support, no alternative could attract 
the two-thirds vote needed to pass the Legislature. And Wilson, Lockyer 
suspects, would demand provisions too tough for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson understands that although many politicians and pundits contend that 
it's unfair and unwise to lock up career thieves for life, most people echo his 
view: To hell with them.

SOMALIS KILL 2 JOURNALISTS FOR REPORTEDLY REFUSING TO SURRENDER VEHICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From the Washington Post

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two journalists working for an Italian television network were shot to death 
Sunday by gunmen who reportedly tried to hijack their vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were identified as reporter Ilaria Alpi, 28, and cameraman Miran 
Krovatin, 45, who were killed with a burst of rifle fire near the former 
Italian Embassy in the gutted ruins of downtown Mogadishu. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the journalists were traveling in a pickup truck with a Somali 
driver and two armed guards when they were stopped by a Land Rover full of 
Somali gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Chris Budge, a U.N. military spokesman, said the gunmen opened fire when 
those in the pickup truck resisted demands that they relinquish the vehicle. He 
said the pickup was riddled. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpi, who had spent time in Somalia last year, returned two weeks ago to 
report on the imminent departure of Italy's military contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had just spoken this morning," Paola Spinelli, a foreign news editor for 
the RAI-3 television network, told the Associated Press. "Ilaria was a brave 
girl, and she never backed down." 
</P>
<P>
 Krovatin, based in Trieste for an independent agency, worked frequently with 
the Italian network. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpi and Krovatin were the sixth and seventh journalists to be killed here 
since the U.N. operation began last May. Several others have been wounded and a 
number of local employees working for news organizations have also fallen 
victim, including eight Somalis killed while working for Cable News Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The withdrawal of Western military contingents, which will be capped by the 
departure on Friday of virtually all remaining U.S. soldiers, has triggered an 
outburst of banditry in the capital. Although nearly 20,000 U.N. troops remain 
in Somalia, they have stopped efforts to disarm Somali gunmen. SOMALIA

AMERICAN ALBUM: RIVER HAS PUSHY PANHANDLERS HANGING IN TREES; FLORIDA OFFICIALS 
WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE 250 MONKEYS FROM TOURIST ATTRACTION. THE ANIMALS HAVE MANY 
FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Many years before Mickey Mouse -- or even Walt Disney -- was born, a 
monumental artesian limestone spring east of this old town in central Florida 
became the state's first great tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard steamboats negotiating winding streams all the way from Jacksonville, 
early eco-tourists -- including Ulysses S. Grant, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Thomas 
A. Edison and Henry Ford -- came to relax and marvel at huge fish deep in the 
gin-clear water gushing from the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors from all over the world still come to see the spring and ride 
glass-bottom boats down the seven-mile-long Silver River that flows from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the banks, they can see all manner of creatures in the wild -- turtles; 
fat, contented alligators; elusive river otters; great blue herons, and 
acrobatic rhesus monkeys. Rhesus monkeys? In the wild? In Florida? Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 250 of them in several troops are on the loose -- this after more 
than 200 were captured during the 1980s. They swing in the trees along the 
river, hide out in the Ocala National Forest, occasionally loll on boat docks 
on the Ocklawaha River and show up near the community of Ft. McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, a North Carolina family canoeing found itself surrounded by 
60 to 80 monkeys after a small boy taunted one of them with food. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports indicate that they have harassed picnickers and dogs in the area and 
raided orange groves. The first reported trouble came more than 50 years ago, 
when a lawman shot a monkey for what was regarded as threatening behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Folklore has it that the monkeys were left behind when MGM came to film the 
first of six Tarzan movies along the river. The truth is that they were already 
here when Johnny Weismuller and Maureen O'Sullivan arrived with a chimpanzee to 
make "Tarzan Finds a Son." 
</P>
<P>
 Ancestors of the animals that now beguile tourists were brought in by an 
entrepreneur in 1938. Colonel Tooey -- he wasn't a colonel, his name was 
Colonel -- released a monkey troop on an island in the river, figuring they 
would enhance visitors' illusions of traveling through a jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Tooey, manager of the Silver River Jungle Boat Cruise, knew more about 
tourists than he knew about monkeys. The animals swam off the island and have 
proliferated in the forest -- intermittent efforts to deport, sterilize or kill 
them notwithstanding. But, as Tooey expected, they have added to the appeal of 
the Silver Spring Attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that two years ago, the monkeys were found to be infected with 
simian Herpes B virus, which can be fatal if transmitted to humans through a 
bite. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Florida -- which had long been interested in taking over the 
commercial Silver Spring Attraction, removing all of its exotic species and 
turning the area into a state park -- by that time had acquired 4,000 acres 
along the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Glisson of the state Division of Recreation and Parks stepped in to get 
rid of the monkeys, planning -- after consultation with Humane Society 
officials -- to trap, tranquilize and kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I blithely stepped into it and very quickly learned that euthanasia is not an 
option," he said. Almost overnight, animal welfare activists and visitors 
captivated by the monkeys produced petitions with thousands of signatures 
demanding that they be spared. When the Ocala Star-Banner solicited reader 
opinions, it received 625 replies, 615 of them calling for the monkeys to 
remain along the river. 
</P>
<P>
 But the viral infection demanded that something be done. The monkeys, Glisson 
said, "are not only intelligent, gregarious and adaptive, but pushy and very 
aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 The state has postponed opening its 4,000 acres along the river, although the 
public can pass through in boats. "Everything else," Glisson said, "has been 
deferred until the monkey issue is resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, owners of the Silver Spring Attraction at the spring itself 
agreed to sell their remaining property and facilities to the state. Under the 
arrangement, the owners will continue to operate their animal attractions, the 
boat rides and tourist facilities for another 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the property is turned over to the state, it is understood that all of 
the exotic species, monkeys included, will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 It is up to the Legislature to decide how. 
</P>
<P>
 A study led by the University of Florida has presented several options, 
including euthanasia, sterilization, relocation or confinement in a huge 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these would require capture. But that, said one bemused local resident, 
would pose no great difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 All it would require, he said, is that Silver Spring Attraction officials stop 
feeding them sweet potatoes, as they do to keep them on the property. Then they 
would simply walk into local restaurants, where they could be arrested, he 
says.

ARAFAT AND ISRAELIS MEET IN BID TO RESTART NEGOTIATIONS; MIDEAST: INCREASING 
TEMPO OF CONTACTS CALLED ENCOURAGING. TOPICS INCLUDE SELF-GOVERNMENT AND 
SECURITY OF CIVILIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the highest-level contact since the Hebron mosque massacre, Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat met Sunday night in Tunis with a 
delegation of senior Israeli bureaucrats in an effort to restart negotiations 
over Palestinian self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 A PLO official said the talks focused on steps Israel could take to ensure the 
security of Palestinian civilians in Israeli-occupied territory, the PLO's main 
condition for resuming formal negotiations, according to news agency reports 
from the Tunisian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 If sufficient progress is made in the preliminary talks, Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres will meet in Paris on Thursday, Israel Radio 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are scheduled to be in the French capital that day for an 
international donors' conference intended to raise funds to pay for Palestinian 
self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will try to speed up the completion of the negotiations as well as the 
implementation of the agreement" on Palestinian autonomy signed in September, 
Peres said Sunday in Jerusalem, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both Israeli and PLO officials insisted that the formal talks have 
not yet resumed, the increasing tempo of contacts was a hopeful sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side wants to appear to give in to the other, but both Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin clearly want to complete work on the 
Palestinian self-rule agreement as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials on both sides, Israel and the PLO were very close to 
wrapping up the details of Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip and 
the West Bank town of Jericho when the PLO broke off the talks to protest the 
Feb. 25 massacre of about 30 Palestinian worshipers in a mosque in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO has demanded that Israel disarm radical Jewish settlers, close down 
some settlements and take steps to guarantee the safety of Palestinian 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Israel has banned two militant Jewish organizations and ordered 
some settlers to turn in their army-issued weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 But PLO officials have said the steps are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem on Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet approved in principle the 
establishment of a Palestinian police presence in Hebron under Israeli 
authority. Rabin suggested such a move after talks last week at the White House 
with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But the PLO says the measure is not acceptable because Israel would retain 
ultimate authority over the police. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli delegation that met Arafat, led by Uri Savir, director general of 
the Foreign Ministry, arrived in Tunis on Sunday afternoon aboard a U.S. Air 
Force jetliner from a military base in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli television said the United States provided the transportation after 
Tunisian authorities refused to permit the Israelis to land in their own 
aircraft. But Reuters news agency said Tunis airport officials said they knew 
nothing of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving Israel, Savir said, "There is principally a need to pave the 
way to (resume) negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Savir said Israel will comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 904, 
passed Friday, demanding that Israel allow establishment of a temporary 
international presence in the occupied territories to protect Palestinian 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the Declaration of Principles that Israel and the PLO 
signed on the White House lawn Sept. 13, Israel was supposed to have withdrawn 
from the Gaza Strip and Jericho during a four-month period from Dec. 13 through 
April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with the negotiations over unsettled details in the declaration still 
incomplete, the Israeli pullback has not yet started. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres said Sunday that Israel is willing to accelerate the pace of its 
withdrawal, turning governmental functions over to a Palestinian authority 
within four to six weeks after the negotiations conclude. But he said nothing 
can be done until the PLO returns to the bargaining table.

FORMER JUDGE, ACCUSED OF FRAUD, TRIES TO IMPLICATE CLINTON; INQUIRY: HE 
REPORTEDLY PROMISES SPECIAL COUNSEL HE WILL TELL OF PRESIDENT'S WHITEWATER 
ROLE. WHITE HOUSE DISCOUNTS CHARGES BY DAVID HALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ and WILLIAM REMPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Hale seems like the last person who should be hurling unsubstantiated 
accusations of criminal wrongdoing at the President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Municipal Court judge, Hale himself stands accused of conspiring to 
defraud the government of $900,000 through phony financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been a saint," he concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite his own legal problems, Hale has been successful in getting people 
to listen to his allegations that President Clinton was a co-conspirator in 
some of his alleged financial misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has discounted Hale's story as a complete fabrication. Betsey 
Wright, a top aide to Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas, says the tale 
is "filled with absolute lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, legions of Democrats, Republicans and other interested observers 
are watching to see if Hale will back up any of what he has alleged with hard 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sources reported Sunday night that Hale had reached a plea agreement 
with special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. under which he agreed to tell a 
federal grand jury what he knows about Clinton's involvement in the Whitewater 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale is expected to enter a plea Tuesday in federal court. A guilty plea would 
clear the way for him to begin testifying Tuesday before a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony could lead to embarrassing public disclosures for the Arkansas 
political Establishment, including the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske had identified Hale as a potential witness in his probe of whether 
Clinton improperly benefited from his investment in a Ozarks real estate 
development company when he was governor. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, Hale, who served as a municipal judge (appointed by then-Gov. 
Clinton) until he was indicted, has not had an opportunity to tell his story in 
detail to Fiske or any other authorities -- only to members of the news media 
who have come to Little Rock to cover the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale went public with his charges late last year after federal prosecutors 
refused his efforts to use the information to negotiate a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hale tells it, his financial and legal troubles stem directly from his 
allegiance to Clinton and his willingness to help what he describes as the 
President's "political family" in Arkansas. It was out of loyalty to Clinton, 
he says, that he began making improper loans from his family's investment 
company to friends and associates of the then-governor. 
</P>
<P>
 While also working as a judge, Hale ran Capital Management Services Inc., a 
firm subsidized by the Small Business Administration to loan long-term venture 
capital to minority and disadvantaged borrowers. Together with his wife and 
sister, he said, he invested about $500,000 in the firm, and the SBA had added 
$1.5 million to create the investment pool he managed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale says he was approached for money in late 1985 by attorney Jim Guy Tucker, 
now the governor of Arkansas, and James B. McDougal, owner of Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan. McDougal and Tucker were partners in several business deals, 
just as McDougal and Clinton were joint investors in the real estate venture 
known as Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale says McDougal's real estate deals had put Madison Guaranty on the brink 
of insolvency and he wanted loans from Hale to help save it. Eventually, Hale 
would lend a total of $700,000 to McDougal-related enterprises, none of which 
was ever repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's name was mentioned in connection with the initial loan request, 
according to Hale. When Hale ran into Clinton in the rotunda of the state 
Capitol a short time later, he said, the governor made it clear that he wanted 
the loans to be made "to help Jim (McDougal) and me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting at McDougal's direction, Hale said, he loaned $50,000 to a former 
Clinton aide and campaign adviser; $260,000 to a real estate development 
partnership including Tucker, and $100,000 to a McDougal real estate venture in 
Nova Scotia. Although the loans apparently breached SBA rules, Hale claims that 
it never occurred to him that he could refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I didn't ask any questions," he said. "That's just how it's done here." 
</P>
<P>
 On an evening in February, 1986, Hale claims, he went to an office on the 
outskirts of Little Rock to meet with Clinton and McDougal, who wanted him to 
make another loan for $150,000. McDougal later upped the request to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It was agreed at that meeting, Hale said, that the loan would be made to 
McDougal's then-wife, Susan, to satisfy government regulations that SBA-backed 
loans be made to disadvantaged people. Her loan application suggested she had 
been denied loans from regular sources because she was from an impoverished 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 As collateral for the loan, according to Hale, Clinton offered to put up some 
raw land in the Ozarks. But Hale declined on grounds the government does not 
regard undeveloped land as reliable collateral. "At that time," Hale said, "I'd 
never heard of Whitewater Development." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $300,000 Hale loaned to Susan McDougal's Master Marketing firm, a 
subsidiary of Madison Guaranty, $110,000 was diverted into the Whitewater 
venture. It is not known where the rest of the money ended up. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hale's firm had no money left to lend at the time of the alleged 
Clinton request, he says he and McDougal cooked up a complex transaction 
designed to persuade SBA officials to provide additional funds for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened this way, according to Hale: McDougal arranged for Hale to sell a 
piece of property the judge owned at a grossly inflated price of $825,000. 
McDougal financed the sale with a loan from Madison Guaranty. In reality, the 
property was worth no more than $400,000, and Hale's equity was only $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said he then put the "profits" into his SBA-backed investment corporation 
and used that money to persuade the government to give him another $1 million. 
Typically, the SBA requires the owner of the investment corporation to raise a 
third of the money while the government supplies the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Flush with new capital, Hale says he was then able to make the new loan to 
Susan McDougal's firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale has never been charged with any crime in connection to the loans related 
to Madison Guaranty, which failed in 1989, but he is accused of defrauding the 
government using a similar scheme three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the later instance, he is accused of borrowing $800,000 from a Shreveport, 
La., man and passing it through his accounts to deceive the SBA into giving him 
another $900,000. As part of his defense to those charges, Hale claims that he 
became involved in the scheme in an effort to make up the money lost in the 
McDougal loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Clinton and McDougal deny that they attended the meeting at the center of 
Hale's story. McDougal concedes that $110,000 of the loan money was diverted to 
Whitewater Development, but he insists that Clinton knew nothing about it and 
that he was managing the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske, a Republican appointed by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to investigate the 
Whitewater case, has said that looking into Hale's story will be a "fundamental 
part" of his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiske had also said he is skeptical of Hale's effort to use the story 
about Clinton as a defense against charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale admits that he is trying to trade his testimony against Clinton for 
leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't be easy for Hale to establish his credibility. Evidence collected 
by Fiske includes a 1987 financial report that quotes Hale defending the 
soundness of a loan now known to be a phony transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Coleman, Hale's Little Rock attorney, said his client is determined to 
testify about the role that Clinton and Tucker played in his downfall. 
</P>

 As he awaits his day in court, Hale portrays himself as a scapegoat who is 
being forced to take the blame for cooperating with some of Arkansas' leading 
Democrats.

 "I don't think it's right for me and my family to be left alone bearing the 
consequences of what was really Arkansas politics as usual," he said. "I guess 
I thought when things got bad for me, the 'political family' would be there for 
me like I was there for them."

DOLE, DEMOCRATS TO PLAN HEARINGS ON WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said Sunday that he will meet with 
Senate Democratic leaders this week to begin planning hearings on the 
Whitewater case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's do it.Let's get the facts out," Dole said on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 But House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, appearing on the same program, 
warned against doing anything that might damage the inquiry being conducted by 
special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is looking into the involvement of President Clinton and First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton in an Arkansas land development corporation linked to a 
failed savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is also probing White House contacts with Treasury Department officials 
regarding a federal investigation of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Fiske) says he's going to get the Washington part of it done in three or 
four weeks. We can have hearings after that, if it's appropriate to do that," 
said Gephardt (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted Thursday to hold hearings on Whitewater but set no timetable. 
Dole said he plans to meet Tuesday with Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) to begin working out a format and schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to interfere with (Fiske's) investigation, but we don't believe 
we have to wait till he shoots the firing pistol and says, 'OK, you can start 
now,' " Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), who has been leading the charge for a Senate 
investigation of the Whitewater controversy, said in an interview Sunday there 
may be "little if anything" at its core. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never said I expected any substantial wrongdoing or any at all," D'Amato 
said on WNBC-TV in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that hearings will start in late April or early May, adding that 
the Clintons probably would be asked to give sworn statements.

<P>
 People tossed their children from the windows of an apartment building, then 
jumped to escape a smoky fire that killed seven people Sunday.Authorities said 
the fire was purposely set. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 10 people sustained injuries, ranging from smoke inhalation to 
second-degree burns. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began in the building's rear stairwell and in two garbage containers, 
Fire Commissioner Raymond Orozco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julius Kuntu, 26, confessed to starting the fire, police said. Kuntu, a 
tenant, was charged with seven counts of first-degree murder, one count of 
aggravated arson and one count of arson, Hernandez said. No motive for the fire 
was given.

RAPIST PAROLED NEAR VICTIM'S HOME, SHE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who says she was a victim of convicted serial rapist Melvin Carter 
faced her "worst nightmare" when he was paroled less then 10 miles from her 
rural Modoc County home, a local official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who said she was raped 16 years ago by Carter while she was a 
student at Cal State Hayward, contacted Modoc County authorities Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, known as the "College Terrace rapist," was paroled Thursday to a 
minimum-security prison camp in the county. He served 12 years of a 25-year 
sentence after pleading no contest to 23 counts of rape, assault, burglary and 
attempted burglary in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was her worst nightmare," Dist. Atty. Ruth Sorensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department of Corrections had no idea that a victim was living in 
the county, agency spokesman Tip Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no indication that any of his victims resided in Modoc 
County," Kindel said. "We've not been officially notified about this. If the 
alleged victim gets in touch with the department, we will certainly review the 
issue."

JACK SMITH: IMITATION HEMINGWAY MAKES FOR REAL LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I have been for the past several years, I was a judge the other night for 
the 14th annual Imitation Hemingway Competition at Harry's Bar and American 
Grill in Century City. It was, as usual, a festive event, with much drinking of 
Chianti and stronger spirits and an Italian feast featuring a ragout of wild 
boar. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges convened two hours before dinner to pick a winner from 11 
finalists, selected by a screening panel from hundreds of entries. My fellow 
judges were Ray Bradbury, Barnaby Conrad, Digby Diehl, Bernice Kert, Paul Keye 
and Dean Faulkner Wells, all writers of note and dedicated Hemingway buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 We had all been on the panel before and were wary of each other's stubborn 
idiosyncrasies. I had never yet picked a winner that the others agreed with and 
was regarded by my colleagues as rather a dangerous nuisance. None of the 
finalists were known to any of us. As it turned out, six of them were women, 
five men. 
</P>
<P>
 Having only 11 papers to read, we were soon engaged in our usual squabble over 
the winner. Surprisingly, I agreed with the choice of most of my colleagues on 
an entry by one B.B. Richmond of Westfield, N.J. Of the noncommittal B.B., I 
assumed the author was a man. 
</P>
<P>
 It began: "She did not have to smile. She did not have to toss her head back 
and laugh, or smoke, or cross her fine white legs the way she did. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemingway certainly would have noticed those fine white legs. So far so good. 
It goes on, "She did not have to lick her lips with that tongue, the kind that 
would not quit. What was she trying to do? Was this her way of being coy at 1 
a.m., or was there a poppy seed caught in her teeth? God only knew, if there 
was a God. And if there was a God, and he knew, he was not talking. And even if 
he did know and was talking, no one would have been listening. Not here. Not 
now. Not with her sitting and licking her lips at Harry's Bar and American 
Grill." (The plug for Harry's Bar is mandatory.) 
</P>
<P>
 One can sense Hemingway's hand in the next paragraph. "All she had to do was 
sit there and breathe and be beautiful. And if he was lucky, perhaps the rain 
would stop and she would get stinking drunk and go for his castanets. He prayed 
she was short. She put out her cigarette in the eye of an old drunk and slid 
off her stool. She was tall. That was fine. Tall was his second choice. (We all 
agreed that "Tall was his second choice" was a funny line.) 
</P>
<P>
 "She walked towards him. His throat tightened and it was not the whiskey. It 
was those defiant breasts of hers, laughing at the law of gravity, calling to 
him, mocking him, taunting him the way Kilimanjaro had taunted him, only 
pinker." 
</P>
<P>
 OK. Like Kilimanjaro, only pinker. We agreed that was a funny line too, 
although a subtle kind of humor that Hemingway didn't often produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had the kind of body that could make the dead jump and the lame rise, and 
he was ready to jump and to rise and also to bark like a dog . . . for a rainy 
night in a tin shack with her. When she got close to him she stopped. She wet 
her lips again and smiled. No poppy seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Got change of a dollar, amigo?' she asked. 'I have to call my old man to 
get the truck and drive me home. Unless, you'd like to . . . drive me home?'  
</P>
<P>
 "Looking into her vapid eyes, he knew she was not only cheap but exquisitely 
shallow, even for Harry's. But any kind of happiness was as rare as turtle 
(word deleted) on a toreador and he had run out of change the way she had run 
out of dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Digby Diehl, taking over the mike at dinner, said someone had called B.B. 
Richmond to tell her she had won, and she cried, "Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh, my 
God!" (Evidently she was surprised.) 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had entered her piece in another contest, but it was disqualified 
because of that one word, which I have excised. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond said she was an artist and writer and owner of Sky Bright Cards, a 
mail-order greeting card company. She described herself as a wife and mother 
with "a strange, twisted sense of humor." She didn't say whether she was short 
or tall, but of course it wouldn't matter.  
</P>
<P>
 The evening ended with dignity and eloquence, and a touch of authentic 
Hemingway, when Charlton Heston read a melancholy paragraph of early Hemingway 
and proposed a toast, with grappa, to the old reprobate himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Heston's brief reading proved that all the entries had been only imitations.

HESTONS MARK 50 YEARS OF 'SYMBIOSIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone was dying to know the secret of Charlton and Lydia Heston's 50 years 
of marriage. Respect? Loyalty? Undying love? 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been asking me, and I have no sensible answer," said Lydia. "But 
tonight I think I know -- turn Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 The former socialist was kidding, but the 200 people who came to celebrate the 
Heston's half-century wedding anniversary loved it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family gathered at the Hotel Nikko in Beverly Hills Friday night 
for a five-hour black-tie dinner-dance that lasted past midnight and included 
loving toasts to the couple as well as some well-meaning roasts, some aimed at 
Heston's well-known conservative politics. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far bigger affair than the Hestons' wartime wedding, witnessed by two 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping the couple celebrate this time around were Edie and Lew Wasserman, 
Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, Mike Medavoy, Fred Hayman, Lee Minnelli, Wayne Rogers, 
Jack Valenti, Martin Landau, Veronique and Gregory Peck, L.A. Mayor Richard 
Riordan, Rosemarie and Robert Stack, former education secretary and drug 
enforcement chief William Bennett, Mel Torme, and Heston children Fraser (with 
wife Marilyn) and Holly (with husband Carlton Rochell). Some offered their own 
theories on the couple's successful union. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very dedicated to each other," said Paramount producer A.C. Lyles, 
who met Heston when the actor first came to the studio decades ago. "And 
they're in love with each other -- I guess that helps, doesn't it? They have 
the unique ability to be in the most glamorous city in the world and yet be the 
most common couple, the way they live, the way they conduct themselves, their 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Torme, a friend of the couple for about 10 years, "At the risk of using a 
cliche, they're very much in love, and it shows at every turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Fraser Heston, who has directed his father in several projects, added, "They 
have their own lives and they have lives together. My mother went from being an 
actress to being a photographer, and the two of them are equally good together 
or apart -- I think that's part of the strength of it. They need each other, 
rely on each other, but it's a good symbiosis." 
</P>
<P>
 Lydia Heston agreed with everyone's assessment of her marriage, and offered 
this advice for newlyweds: "Hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlton Heston recalled meeting his wife in a theater class at Northwestern 
University when he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my first date," he said. "My first date with anybody. I was a pretty 
weird kid then. But I obviously found the right girl the first time out. And I 
had the brains to recognize that, even at 17." 
</P>
<P>
 Further details of their courtship were laid out in "Pursuing Lydia," a 
chapter from Heston's not-quite-completed autobiography that was given to each 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
 The party had a definite anniversary celebration feel to it, with guests like 
Robert Stack showing some fancy footwork on the dance floor and Heston taking 
his grandson Jack Heston around for a spin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hestons cut a four-tier anniversary cake to the strains of "Moonlight 
Serenade" and then settled in for entertainment from Torme and guitarist Liona 
Boyd, plus a round of toasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Said friend Leonard Stern: "A toast to a couple currently appearing in the 
longest-running marriage in town. May there be many curtain calls."

INTERNAL NATIVE AMERICAN DISPUTES STALL KOLL PROJECT; ARCHEOLOGY: DEVELOPERS 
SAY THEY DID EVERYTHING RIGHT IN PLAN TO BUILD 4,286 HOMES NEAR BOLSA CHICA 
WETLANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group thought it had done everything right. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost from the beginning of its effort to construct 4,286 homes near the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands, the company had followed state recommendations by 
employing a Native American to monitor the site in case workers stumbled on an 
ancient burial ground or uncovered artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, about the time that Native American bone fragments were discovered, 
Koll contacted leaders of the two Orange County bands -- the Juanenos and the 
Gabrielinos -- to make sure that each group could participate in preserving its 
heritage by designating separate monitors for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 And recently company officials organized a gathering of the six people 
designated by the California Native Heritage Commission as the "most likely 
descendants" of the individuals whose remains had been found. The purpose: to 
hear their recommendations regarding the bones' disposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite its stated good intentions, Koll today is embroiled in a 
controversy that has stalled the project. So far there have been two Native 
American demonstrations protesting the work. And the Huntington Beach City 
Council recently voted to ask the Orange County Grand Jury to investigate 
whether the handling of the bones was legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, Koll officials are trying to figure out what went askew. They deny 
any wrongdoing. Yet they have been caught in the middle of a slew of age-old 
conflicts among Native Americans involving territory, tribal status and fierce 
competition for monitoring jobs that pay $200 to $300 a day. Central to the 
dispute is the location of Bolsa Chica, to which two bands of Native Americans 
lay claim. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are serious questions regarding the handling of the bones. A 
report compiled by Councilman Ralph Bauer contains, among other things, 
eyewitness accounts suggesting that human remains may have been found at the 
site much earlier than Koll has admitted. Further, Bauer has records indicating 
that the find may not have been reported to the coroner's office quickly enough 
to satisfy the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials have steadfastly denied any error. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those clamoring for the investigation, however, were Native Americans 
angry at the developer for a different reason altogether: They said the company 
had left them out of the loop by dealing with the wrong Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is war," said Jim Velasques, chief of a group called the coastal 
Gabrielinos. "There'll be no more messing around." 
</P>
<P>
 Said archeologist Patricia Martz of the Bolsa Chica controversy: "It's a 
pretty typical situation." Martz, an archeologist on the faculty of Cal State 
Los Angeles and head of the state historical resources commission, said she had 
seen similar situations up and down the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only human nature," she said. Native Americans "are not getting their 
share of the American dream and they were the first Americans. It's sad, 
really," she said. Protecting their heritage "is the only empowerment they have 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Velasques put it into economic terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Archeology is a gold mine," he said. "Native Americans can make money hand 
over fist." 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't the first time such issues have been thrust under the noses of Orange 
County developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Velasques himself was being paid $35 an hour -- $10 of it for 
a leased pickup truck and cellular phone -- to act as a full time monitor for 
the Irvine Co. on its Newport Coast construction project. A group calling 
itself the Native American Coalition of Southern California threatened to stage 
a demonstration protesting the alleged mishandling of human remains. One of its 
major concerns, said the coalition -- whose members included David Belardes, a 
Juaneno, and Vera Rocha, founder of a separate Gabrielino group -- was the 
selection of Velasques to represent the Gabrielinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we had was a difference of opinion among different people who 
represented themselves as Gabrielinos," recalls Bernard Maniscalco, who oversaw 
the project for the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of negotiations, the company hit on a solution: hire the 
opposition as well. Members of both the Belardes and Rocha families were given 
full-time jobs as archeological field assistants on the project, working with 
Velasques. And almost immediately, the problem disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was miscommunication," Maniscalco says now. "Hiring representatives of 
both families helped to provide for better communication all around." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Koll company say that they too tried hard to hire the correct 
representatives of the Native Americans for Bolsa Chica. Back in 1992, they 
say, following the advice of the California Native American Heritage 
Commission, the company contacted designated representatives of both the 
Juaneno and Gabrielino bands to get their recommendations regarding Native 
American monitors. Speaking for the Juanenos was Belardes. Representing the 
Gabrielinos was Cindi Alvitre, then chairwoman of the Gabrielino/Tongva Tribal 
Council. What followed was a three-month correspondence between Koll and 
Alvitre that seemed to start with good intentions, but unraveled altogether in 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the subject was monitors; Alvitre approved the hiring of an interim 
monitor to serve on a temporary basis until permanent monitors -- including two 
Gabrielinos -- could be selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the company asked her to sign an agreement on behalf of her band under 
which any remains found would be reburied with full Native American 
participation at another site near the wetlands. It was during negotiations on 
this issue that Alvitre made the request that ultimately proved fatal to the 
discussions: she asked for $4,800 from the company to pay for four Native 
American shamans -- religious leaders -- to visit the site for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Koll officials balked, saying that while they were willing to make the site 
available to the shamans for one day, they were not willing to pay for the 
visit. Alvitre wrote back rejecting the offer and negotiations broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is a shakedown," Velasques later said of Alvitre's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvitre, who has since resigned from the tribal council and formed a separate 
group, did not return several calls. During the recent meeting with a Koll 
official and other Native Americans to discuss the disposition of the bones, 
however, she defended her request as both reasonable and necessary. "I didn't 
feel it was inappropriate," she is quoted as saying in a transcript supplied by 
the company. "Many of these medicine people I was going to bring out . . . are 
on fixed incomes. . . . We're not being reimbursed or compensated for any of 
this. . . . It's not a financial endeavor . . . not an exploitive type of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the Koll organization hired three Native American monitors for the 
project -- a member of the Luiseno band, a Juaneno and a Gabrielino whose 
standing later was challenged by Alvitre and others. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Bolsa Chica controversy has heated up in the last couple of 
years, such tribal challenges and conflicts go back centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, most archeologists agree, the Gabrielinos occupied the territory 
north of Aliso Creek -- in what is now South Laguna -- while the Juanenos were 
on the land to the south, principally around what would become San Juan 
Capistrano. Juanenos, however, now cite what they describe as a longstanding 
agreement between the two bands under which, on political matters, they 
represent Orange County and the Gabrielinos represent Los Angeles County, an 
assertion the Gabrielinos dispute. And in recent years at least four separate 
Gabrielino groups have emerged, each claiming to truly represent the band. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Gabrielino factionalism, in fact, that provides much of the fuel for the 
present debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasques, chief of a Santa Ana-based group called the Local Coastal 
Gabrielino Tribal Council, says he represents 500 Native Americans and is the 
true spokesman for the Orange County Gabrielinos. Martin Alcala, current 
chairman of the Gabrielino/-Tongva Tribal Council based in Marina del Rey, 
claims that his group is the sole legitimate voice of Gabrielinos. And both 
Alvitre and Rocha have broken off to form their own separate Gabrielino groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Riverside makes no formal 
distinctions between the various groups of Gabrielinos, according to tribal 
operations officer Frances Muncy. Upon request, she said, the bureau will 
document an individual's family heritage and issue a certificate attesting to 
tribal affiliation and degree of Native American blood. 
</P>
<P>
 And in designating the most likely descendants for a particular archeological 
dig, the California Native American Heritage Commission plays no favorites, 
preferring instead to stay out of jurisdictional disputes, said Larry Myers, 
executive secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it is extremely difficult to determine who represents which group," 
Myers said. "I don't really want to get caught in an argument over who's a real 
Indian; we accept (people's claims) at face value." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the field is wide open for competition and backbiting among 
various tribal groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, in fact, Velasques stood up at a Huntington Beach City 
Council meeting to publicly blast Native Americans who accept money to oversee 
the disinterment of their ancestors' bones. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that was my mother's bones," he said, "I promise you that no one would 
have to grease my palms to be out there watching. If you have to pay them, you 
own them." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in addition to serving as full time paid monitor for the Irvine Company 
from 1988 to 1991, Velasques last year applied for -- but did not get -- a 
similar job on a project at Loyola Marymount University in Westchester. And as 
recently as last November, Koll officials say, he made an offer -- which the 
company refused -- to provide an archeological "peer review" of the Bolsa Chica 
project for a fee of $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he wouldn't even have to visit the site," Susan Hori, a lawyer 
representing the company, recalled. "He assured me that everything was going 
fine on site and that if we hired him it would resolve any potential problems 
with the Gabrielinos." 
</P>
<P>
 Velasques confirmed that he had made such an offer, adding that a simple 
conversation with the archeologist involved in the project would have made a 
site visit unnecessary. "I just wanted them to tell me what they were doing," 
he said. Had the Koll company been willing to negotiate separate deals with him 
and with the various other Gabrielino factions, Velasques said, "they could 
have laid the thing to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which leaves Koll officials shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to go through things like the tribal councils and end up getting 
caught in a lot of personal battles between individuals," Hori said. "There 
seem be a lot of power struggles and you end up getting caught in the middle."

<P>
 A powerful aftershock to the Northridge earthquake rolled across Southern 
California on Sunday, igniting two fires, disrupting power to thousands of San 
Fernando Valley residents and sending people fleeing from malls and movie 
theaters, but inflicting little physical damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5.3-magnitude quake, centered near Panorama City, was felt over a wide 
area of Los Angeles and Orange counties when it hit at 1:20 p.m. It was the 
third strongest of more than 6,000 aftershocks that have struck the region 
since the Jan. 17 quake that killed at least 61 people and caused at least $13 
billion in structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh aftershock greater than magnitude 5.0, and it served to 
keep quake-jittery Angelenos on edge for yet another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeways sustained some "cosmetic cracking," but no major damage, a state 
transit official said. 
</P>
<P>
 For fans camped outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for tonight's Oscar 
ceremonies, the shaker gave them a second authentic L. A. experience -- but did 
not move them from their cherished places. Rhea Sprecher, an art teacher from 
Wisconsin, still managed to spot Debbie Allen, Goldie Hawn and others. "I felt 
some rumbling under my feet and I said: 'Would that be an earthquake?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, chandeliers swayed, seats rocked and huge pieces of scenery rattled. 
"Everybody, stay in your seats!" Oscar director Jeff Margolis ordered over the 
public address system. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city Fire Department officials said two fires were started by the 
earthquake. A mini-mall blaze in Van Nuys began because of electrical damage 
caused by the quake, and a transformer at a Department of Water and Power plant 
near Burbank Airport caught fire after earthquake damage caused oil in the unit 
to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire destroyed the Woodley Plaza shopping center in Van Nuys, burning a 
mini-market, video store and a restaurant, said Fire Department spokesman Jim 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 But elsewhere, there was little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, a minor rockslide failed to disrupt traffic. And in Santa Monica, 
life in the bustling Third Street Promenade shopping and dining area was back 
to normal shortly after the temblor stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seismically, this is a very expected behavior. Probably the big news story in 
this earthquake is people's nerves," said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere, hundreds of people were evacuated 
from malls and theaters as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people were removed from IKEA, a home furnishings store in 
Burbank. Despite shoppers' anxiety, the evacuation was quick and orderly, said 
Dennis Rodriguez, the store's operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were a little frightened. We got workers together with customers and 
guided them downstairs," Rodriguez said. Some children were separated from 
parents but were reunited outside the building, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 500 shoppers were evacuated from the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall, 
where the aftershock shattered plate glass alongside an escalator and sent some 
overhead spotlights crashing to the floor. No one was injured at the mall, 
where the first 34 of the complex's 140 stores closed since the Jan. 17 quake 
reopened only Saturday, employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the rain yesterday, and another aftershock today," said Bob Smith, a 
mall employee. "It's been a tough weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also rocked the Glendale Galleria shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shook us pretty hard," said Drew Boghorsyan of the mall's customer 
services department. "We heard the building just rumble. It was really scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Boghorsyan said 26 of the 248 stores in the mall closed after the quake 
because merchants wanted to go home. He said he knew of no damage to the stores 
that closed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sherman Oaks house, moved off its foundation by the Jan. 17 quake and 
scheduled for demolition today, was sent sliding another 30 feet down the 
hillside, imperiling other houses below. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley movie theaters, moviegoers fled their seats as they were showered 
with broken plaster and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some big tiles that fell down," said John Corcoran, who was at the 
Fallbrook Mall theater in Canoga Park. The jolt also shook up construction 
workers still repairing damage from the January temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 James Booth of Burbank was on a bucket lift filling cracks on the second floor 
of the Cal State Northridge science building when the shaking hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was this jackass shaking the bottom of the lift," Booth said, 
pointing to a co-worker. Then, he added, "I thought the entire building was 
going to come down." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge Fashion Center, badly damaged in the January quake, 23 
employees from a wrecking firm also were startled by the aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the center of the mall when it hit," said Al Flores, a supervisor 
for Cleveland Wrecking Co. "It was a lot of bumping up and down. We just got 
all our people together, made sure everyone was all right, and got out of 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer Chris Brock, of Law/Crandall Inc., a firm hired to evaluate the 
damage caused at CSUN by the Northridge quake, said inspectors have found "many 
new cracks, but nothing major yet." 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Monica conference of the Anxiety Disorders Assn. of America ended with 
a bang as the quake struck. "I tell you, the timing couldn't have been better. 
It was the last day, the last minute, the last second and it hit. It was pretty 
ironic," said association President Jerilyn Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 At Disneyland in Anaheim, some of the more elaborate attractions were 
temporarily closed down. At Universal Studios in Universal City, all 
attractions closed immediately after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cangco of Glendale was on a tram going over a bridge that falls apart as 
part of the special effects tour at Universal when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize it was an earthquake at the time. I thought it was an effect 
of the . . . tram." 
</P>
<P>
 But the shocks seemed too intense to be part of the attraction, he said, and 
the driver didn't say anything. The ride continued, but the King Kong and 
earthquake attractions, scheduled to be included in the tour, were closed. Only 
when the 45-minute ride ended did someone inform the riders that a real 
earthquake had hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock also knocked out power to about 77,000 San Fernando Valley 
residents, most for five minutes or less, Department of Water and Power 
spokeswoman Mindy Berman said. However, about 7,000 customers in Van Nuys were 
without electricity for half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans reported minor damage to freeways near the epicenter of the 
aftershock, but none serious enough to close any roads. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Golden State Freeway north of Granada Hills, the aftershock dislodged 
temporary asphalt filler that had been used to close a 6-to-8-inch gap caused 
by the Northridge quake. Temporary asphalt fixes also came loose in a concrete 
overpass at the interchange of the Simi Valley and San Diego freeways. Caltrans 
crews quickly refilled the gaps without shutting down any of the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that would alarm anyone," said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie 
Tiritilli. "It's super-minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech seismologists said the aftershock was expected and fell within the 
normal range. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is perfectly normal. This is what we expect," said Egill Hauksson, a 
seismologist at Caltech. He said Sunday's shaking occurred on the east side of 
the fault plane where the main shock occurred on Jan. 17, but was not on the 
same fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismic authorities said the aftershock was centered about two miles 
west-northwest of Panorama City, and about three miles northeast of the 
epicenter of the Northridge quake. It fell within a "pie-shaped aftershock 
zone" where shocks have been clustered, Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock was closer to the surface than the Northridge quake, with 
preliminary estimates putting it about nine miles underground, compared to 12 
miles for the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 With a preliminary magnitude of 5.3, the quake is 1/20 the magnitude of the 
Jan. 17 quake. Hutton said the average number of aftershocks continues to 
decline each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's temblor "is an aftershock, but it is also an earthquake on its own" 
and will produce its own aftershocks, she said. However, there is only a 1 in 
20 chance that it was a precursor of a larger quake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two other aftershocks, at magnitudes 5.6 and 5.9, have been stronger than 
Sunday's, and both occurred the day of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's aftershock was followed by two lesser ones, a 3.4-magnitude 
aftershock recorded at 3:34 p.m., and another reading 2.7 at 8:05 p.m., 
seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a spokesman for Farmers Insurance Co. said Sunday's aftershock 
could trigger a temporary suspension of underwriting earthquake insurance in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geologists may call this an aftershock, but this is a separate quake for 
insurance purposes," said Jeffrey Beyer, spokesman for Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows insurers to impose a moratorium of up to 60 days on sales of 
earthquake insurance when an quake occurs. A moratorium imposed after the Jan. 
17 Northridge quake covered about 100 square miles and lasted no more than 30 
days at many companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any moratoriums still in effect," Bill Schulz, spokesman for 
the California Department of Insurance, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock prompted Valley business owners and authorities to close some 
public structures so they could check for structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, owners shut down the 75-store Media City Center mall for the day 
after sprinklers jolted by the aftershock drenched some shoppers. City building 
inspectors also ordered the mall parking structure closed until it could be 
inspected, said Lt. Don Brown, of the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said schools will be 
open "as usual" today, although workers will inspect repairs from the January 
quake to make sure they held. In all, 76 public schools were damaged in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, the district's facilities director, said, "We will be out at the 
schools where there was previous damage to make sure the repairs are still 
holding." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to hit the ones that had the most damage and the least permanent 
repair work done and work our way back from there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington, D.C.-based Anxiety Disorders Assn. had been discussing such 
problems as traumatic stress disorders, like those brought on by the Jan. 17 
quake, in its four-day conference at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final seminar drew to a close, the fifth-floor banquet room began to 
shake and the chandeliers rattled noisily. The seminar ended with applause and 
laughter -- for the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the 550-person conference had featured a seminar called "The Los 
Angeles Earthquake and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder." And as their time in 
the city came to a close, some of the psychiatrists and social workers joked 
about earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jokingly, we who'd never experienced an earthquake said, 'Gee, I wish I could 
feel just a little one so I could know what it feels like,' " Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 * FEW REPEATS: Sunday's temblor caused few problems at Valley sites hit hard 
by the Jan. 17 quake. B1

CITY'S THIRST POSES THREAT TO WATERWAY; ENVIRONMENT: THE VENTURA RIVER SERVES 
URBAN WATER NEEDS. BUT SIPHONING AFFECTS THE LIFE IT SUPPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 About six miles up the Ventura River Valley and just west of California 33 
sits Foster Park, a river-side refuge where lovers court and swallows dart 
through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a canopy of giant sycamores, eucalyptus and oaks, this 200 acres of 
nature offers something few other parks in Southern California can -- a river. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura River, with its brushy banks that give children a chance to 
trap a tadpole or listen to a symphony of chirping birds, also slakes a city's 
growing thirst. 
</P>
<P>
 And Foster Park is where the city of Ventura taps the river's flow most 
heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the city diverts water for up to 20,000 families a year, slowing the 
river and leaving it shallower, thereby warming it and essentially altering the 
life it supports. 
</P>
<P>
 The diversion can hardly be noticed from the park. An underground dam cuts 60 
feet down to the river's bedrock and pipes water to the city's water treatment 
plant along upper Ventura Avenue. Four wells farther up the river siphon 
subsurface river water off to also be sent to the water treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our oldest and best water supply," said Ronald J. Calkins, director of 
public works for the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has turned to the river first to fill as much of its annual water 
needs as possible, he said. After the river, the city looks to Lake Casitas, 
which also gets its water from the river and its tributaries. Lastly, Ventura 
goes to its deep water wells in the city's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the city wants to increase its supply from the Ventura River. Although 
the city would have to prepare a complete environmental impact report before it 
could take more water, Calkins and other officials maintain they may have 
rights to claim all the water in the river during dry months. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's that claim -- despite city assurances that environmental 
repercussions would be considered -- that has state biologists concerned that 
the lower river may soon face one of its most serious threats yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a convoluted series of water rights transfers over the last 120 years 
among the Santa Ana Water Co.; Ventura Water, Light and Power Co.; Southern 
California Edison and others, the city claims the right to 4,000 miners' inches 
per year from the river. 
</P>
<P>
 That's an antiquated term of measurement left over from the state's early 
mining days. It's the equivalent of about 54,000 acre-feet of water per year -- 
or enough water to totally supply 108,000 families. 
</P>
<P>
 That is more than five times what the city now takes from the river and much 
more than the city needs, Calkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the city may have a more far-reaching right to the water. The city 
believes that it has so-called pueblo water rights granted more than 200 years 
ago by Spain. And he believes that the city could prove that, if necessary, by 
examining historical records in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some question whether we have a pueblo right, which is the right to 
just about anything," Calkins said. "But if we have it, it's great stuff. A 
pueblo right is the granddaddy of them all." 
</P>
<P>
 A pueblo right, which California courts have already ruled can be claimed by 
the cities of Los Angeles and San Diego, dates from the days of the missions 
and entitles the cities to all the water they need from nearby rivers, 
including ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a pueblo right -- which could still be contested in court -- would 
exempt the city from being forced to allow a minimum amount of water to flow 
down the river, as California Department of Fish and Game biologists have 
requested, Calkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's population of 96,000 uses 16,000 acre-feet of water annually, with 
up to 10,000 acre-feet of that taken from the Ventura River. City-paid experts 
will soon begin studying the river to find out how much more water it can give 
up, and at what environmental cost, said Steve Wilson, the city's water 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 After that study, the city will write a master plan to improve water works at 
Foster Park by altering the underground dam's intake, building a permanent dike 
to funnel the water into the dam and refurbishing the four subsurface wells. 
The city's pipelines also need to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know yet how much water is available," Wilson said. "But we're 
trying to get the most we can of our water rights with the most minimal impact 
on the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The city wants the extra water for two main reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson would like to ship more water to the city's east end, which is now 
supplied by poor-quality ground water from wells in east Ventura and Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to improving drinking water in the east, it would also allow the 
basins there to rest and refill. That would make more water available during 
times of drought. 
</P>
<P>
 But more importantly, Calkins said, the city may be able to delay for several 
years the very expensive proposition of building a plant to desalinate seawater 
if it can enhance its present water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The city proposes to spend $1.5 million to study, design and implement 
improvements to its water diversion facilities. That compares to estimates of 
$33 million to $55 million to build a desalination plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spending millions to use the resources we have really pays off," he said. 
"It's a lot of money, but it's a lot cheaper than desal." 
</P>
<P>
 Calkins said Fish and Game's request to leave water in the river for fish and 
wildlife may not be valid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure they can make us do that," Calkins said. "But we try to balance 
the needs of the river because the health of the river is important to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Wilson, a Fish and Game biologist and environmental specialist, said the 
issue is not how much water is taken when the river is swollen from rain, but 
how much passes by when the water level is low. 
</P>
<P>
 "They believe they can take all the water they want to," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diverting too much water will dry up pools, heat up the water and could wipe 
out the endangered species that live in the estuary along with what is left of 
the steelhead trout population. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, we have to say we're not going to take any more water from 
these streams," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the lower stretch of the river below Foster Park is dried up by diverting 
too much water, what is left of the once plentiful steelhead run could 
disappear entirely from the Ventura River, said Fish and Game biologist 
Mauricio Cardenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Steelhead, which once ran up the river by the thousands, still exist in the 
river, possibly 100 to 200 of them. Cardenas said he wants to see that the 
population grows strong once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in cowboy boots and jeans, Cardenas recently walked the river's banks, 
checking on algae bloom at the outfall of the Ojai Valley Sanitary District 
sewage treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, as he hiked down a trail and through the brush behind the 
abandoned Petrochem refinery, he spooked a white egret and prompted it into 
graceful flight. Later, a startled great blue heron also took flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in his lumbering green pickup truck labeled with the Fish and Game logo, 
Cardenas drove down Old Creek Road and stopped for an impromptu temperature 
check of the San Antonio Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is concerned about the city's plan to take more water from the 
river and the effect that might have on the once mighty steelhead population as 
well as other fish and wildlife downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," Cardenas said. "Really scary." Other Perils Ahead 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it retains enough water for fish and wildlife to live, the Ventura 
River faces other perils, now and in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The river is protected from pollution at its headwaters by the forest, where 
few people live, farming is sparse, and golf courses and industry do not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the large sources of pollution along the river have been controlled in 
recent years under the federal Clean Water Act. Industry is no longer allowed 
to dump chemicals into the river. The oil companies that line Ventura Avenue 
are highly regulated, although accidents -- like a 370,000-gallon spill of oil 
byproducts disclosed last week -- can always occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewage treatment plants also must meet a strict standard for bacteria and 
water temperature before their treated water can be released into the river. In 
fact, the Ojai Valley Sanitary District now is under state order to upgrade the 
level of treated sewer water it discharges. 
</P>
<P>
 But a more insidious problem remains in the seemingly harmless gutters along 
the streets of the entire populated area of the Ventura River watershed. Mark 
Capelli, executive director of the Friends of the Ventura River and a lecturer 
at UC Santa Barbara, said the storm drains are one of the most serious threats 
to the river and its health. 
</P>
<P>
 "A river is a creature of and a product of its watershed," Capelli said. 
"That's one of the reasons rivers are so vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 The gutters that empty into storm drains collect tire remnants, dog droppings, 
back yard pesticides and crankcase oil. Waste from the streets of Ojai, Meiners 
Oaks, Oak View, Casitas Springs and west Ventura empty untreated into the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 But a newly enforced measure of the Clean Water Act requires the cities and 
counties to write plans to get the pollutants out of storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Those plans are years away from being translated into action in the 
communities. In the meantime, said Alex Sheydayi, manager of the Ventura County 
Flood Control Department, public education is a must. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to be educated not to back their cars up over the curb and open 
their crankcase into the catch basin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ventura County is working on regulations to reduce the amount of 
runoff from construction and other industrial sites, where unused concrete or 
grease may be left out to be knocked over in an earthquake or flushed into the 
river during a storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take time," said Sheydayi. "It's taken us many years to get here and 
now it will take us many years to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, still more people and businesses will move into the Ventura River 
Valley and the Ojai Valley. The population in the area already tops an 
estimated 50,000 people. And the county's current plan for the unincorporated 
area alone calls for another 2,188 homes and 5,560 residents by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Those residents will not only draw their drinking water from the river or 
subsurface wells, they will add to the problems of runoff by their numbers 
alone. Many will use fertilizers and pesticides to plant new lawns and kill 
weeds; residues of those chemicals will eventually make their way into the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 And more industry is likely to eventually settle along Ventura Avenue, which 
parallels the river. A project proposed by Michael Towbes Development of 
Montecito had been in the works for five years. It would have created an 
industrial park on 21 acres near the avenue at Canada Larga. The project was 
withdrawn earlier this year, due in part to the economy and the environmental 
report that would have been required, said county planner Pat Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Richards said, there will be other proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is vacant land and someone is going to come along and develop it 
sometime," he said. "The only way to change that is to change the zoning." With 
the area already surrounded by industry, it would be difficult to change the 
zoning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And once the oil fields that line Ventura Avenue become unproductive, there 
will be pressure to convert that land to other industry as well, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to runoff from industry, there is residue from sprayed crops that 
makes its way into the river. The pesticides used to keep fruit and vegetables 
disease- and bug-free can also harm or kill native plants and animals in and 
along the river, biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 And golf courses, with their manicured lawns and velvety putting greens, are 
notorious for high pesticide use. 
</P>
<P>
 There are already two golf courses in the Ventura River watershed, the public 
course at Soule Park east of Ojai and the private course at the Ojai Valley 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Farmont Corp. proposes to build another golf course on 203 acres of 
open land west of the Ventura River. Japanese media tycoon Kagehisa Toyama, 
owner of the Farmont property, plans to build a lavish retirement resort there, 
said Maurice Stans, head of the project for the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an 18-hole course, driving range and clubhouse with restaurant 
that have already won approval, Toyama also wants to build a retirement home on 
an adjacent lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He reveres golf as a religion," said Stans, a former Nixon Administration 
official now working in Los Angeles. "He wants to build one of the best golf 
courses in the world, within an hour of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cat Brown, a biologist with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, sees golf 
courses in another light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Golf courses are a terrible waste of land," she said. In this case, "it will 
convert something with a very high value habitat into a pesticide-laden 
playground for the wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
 The course will attract deer, birds and other wildlife, which might come to 
drink from the artificial lakes. But the animals of the woods are not likely to 
be welcome visitors at the course, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be lucky if they are only scared away," Brown said. "More likely, 
they will be killed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Richards pointed out that the Ventura County Board of Supervisors placed 
restrictions on the company to protect the environment when it approved 
Farmont's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmont will be required to install a type of membrane beneath the course that 
would, in theory, catch the runoff from the greens and channel it back into the 
lakes on the course, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Farmont must stop using potable water and find a source of 
reclaimed water for the grounds within eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents have argued that a golf course maintains open space and is better 
than developing the area with housing. The current General Plan, however, 
allows only one house on every 20 acres for the area, Richards said. The 
Riverbed Homeless 
</P>
<P>
 As the Ventura River winds its way from the Los Padres National Forest to the 
sea, it encounters one of the most complex political problems of all -- 
homeless people who live in the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in dry areas of the river bottom beneath the Main Street Bridge, live 
about 100 people. They include the mentally ill, the down and out and the 
desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have spacious if rudimentary living areas, accentuated with carpets, 
picnic tables and abandoned car benches. One dwelling has two bedrooms, 
protected from wind and rain by blue tarps lashed to wooden frames with duct 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 They live without benefit of plumbing for washing or personal needs. Soap from 
washed dishes and clothes goes into the river or into the ground. Garbage is 
buried or discarded in piles, although some carry their trash out to bins. And 
without bathrooms anywhere nearby, the ground often serves as a latrine. 
</P>
<P>
 And all of it -- the furniture, the trash, the human waste -- becomes refuse 
that is washed down the river and into the estuary when heavy rains create the 
kind of torrential flows the county saw during the last two winters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The presence of humans down there has a serious impact on the wildlife," said 
Lawrence E. Hunt, a biologist who walked through bushes one day only to 
surprise a group of homeless men who told him he was lucky he was not shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fish can become infected if there is a high level of bacteria," he said. "And 
birds can become infected when they eat infected clams and snails and other 
filter-feeding organisms." 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless interfere with the natural ecosystem in other ways as well, Hunt 
said. Some of the river-bottom inhabitants fish without a license or regard for 
fishing season, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spread nets across the water and catch the steelhead when they are going 
upstream to spawn," he said. "It's a bad situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is now planning a major restoration of the lower river. The first 
phase relies mostly on volunteer efforts to remove the giant reed, arundo 
donax, which has invaded the river's entire length. The reeds suck up water and 
oxygen, choking out native plants and clogging up the river's flow during 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city also wants to create a nature area, called the Seaside Wilderness 
Park, at the mouth of the river. The project -- a joint effort of the city, 
California Department of Parks and Recreation, and the California Coastal 
Conservancy -- envisions the wilderness area with interpretive signs and 
possibly wooden walkways to protect sensitive wildlife habitat and vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Millais, director of community development for the city, said the 
restoration can never be complete as long as there are people living in the 
river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real dichotomy," said Millais. "We have a nature preserve at the river 
mouth, and up the river we have a substantial homeless population living in 
substandard conditions. But it is an issue without an inexpensive or easy 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
 There are not enough homeless shelters in the county to provide a place to 
live for those people, Millais said. And even if there were, he said it is 
unlikely that they would all leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some would welcome the opportunity for a place to live," he said. "But others 
would not." 
</P>
<P>
 A man who called himself Easy, who lives at the river bottom, falls into the 
latter category. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can they make us all leave?" he asked. "Some are experienced jungle 
fighters. And everybody has a weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Herbie, the 27-year-old "cellmate" with whom Easy shares a lean-to, came to 
the river bottom recently after he got out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got nowhere else to go," he said. "But I wouldn't live in a shelter. 
They're too disrespectful all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Millais said the city at one time provided portable toilets and garbage bins 
in a city parking lot near the bicycle trail at Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that didn't begin to address the problem," Millais said. "And ideally, we 
would like to get facilities (elsewhere) that would entice people to leave the 
river rather than making it easier for them to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 But the homeless are not the only people who affect the river bottom, Hunt 
said. He has also found tracks from motorcycles near the estuary, and shells 
left by people shooting at rodents, quail or "anything else that moves," Hunt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All those problems must be addressed if the plan to restore the estuary and 
create a nature preserve is to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hunt, Brown, Capelli and others who want to preserve the integrity of the 
river agree that the park must be planned in a way that allows people to see 
nature, without trampling all over it. "It's a balancing act," Hunt said. 
"You're trying to preserve an area, but you don't want to keep people out." 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli said exposing people to a little-known resource that is so close to 
them is the best way to convert people to the cause of protecting and 
preserving the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people don't even see the river unless they drive up Highway 33," he 
said. "And yet, here is this beautiful jewel of a river right in our own back 
yard." An Endangered Habitat 
</P>
<P>
 MYRIAD THREATS TO PLANTS AND WILDLIFE 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura River and its tributaries provide an essential network or 
corridors for wildlife that roam the forest and the Ventura River Valley. The 
rivers and their wide channels offer animals the necessities of life -- water, 
foraging grounds and shelter along the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Voices 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some question whether we have a pueblo right (to Ventura River 
water), which is the right to just about anything. But if we have it, it's 
great stuff. A pueblo right is the granddaddy of them all." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ronald J. Calkins, director of Public Works, city of Ventura on the city's 
water rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary. Really scary." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mauricio Cardenas, biologist, California Department of Fish and Game, 
referring to plans by the City of Ventura to study how much more water can be 
taken from the Ventura River at Foster Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental Issues 
</P>
<P>
 * The homeless: About 100 homeless people live in the river bottom beneath the 
Main Street Bridge without benefit of trash pickup or flushing toilets. Their 
encampment, which adds waste and other pollution to the river, causes concern 
among public agencies working to develop a wilderness area downstream at the 
river mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 * New houses: The new Ojai area portion of the county General Plan calls for 
another 2,188 homes in the area around Meiners Oaks, Mira Monte and Oak View by 
the year 2010. That will add another 5,560 residents to the area. They will 
either take their water from Lake Casitas or from the ground water basins of 
the Ventura River Valley or the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * New development: Vacant lots along Ventura Avenue are zoned for commercial 
and industrial use and eventually will be developed. In addition, as the oil 
fields along Ventura Avenue become unproductive in years ahead, property owners 
will want to convert that land to other industrial uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Main Street Bridge: The current bridge built in 1932 and its predecessor made 
a favorite spot for fishing in the first half of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Fairgrounds: The fairgrounds, which filled in wetlands and part 
of the river delta, was at one time a Chumash village with as many as 400 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaside Wilderness Park: The city of Ventura, California Department of Parks 
and Recreation and the California Coastal Conservancy are working together to 
create a wilderness area that would let people see nature up close. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife Along The River 
</P>
<P>
 Los Padres National Forest: The forest, which is a vast tract of undeveloped 
land, helps protect the river and its watershed. There are few houses or roads 
and no development to cause pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo Willow ( Salix Lasiolepis ): The Arroyo willow grows along the length 
of the river. It is a common native tree with a thin trunk only a few inches in 
diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyote ( Canis Latrans ): Coyotes are nighttime wanderers along the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Goldenrod ( Euthamia ocidentalis ): The Western goldenrod is one of 
the native wildflowers found in the lower Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster Park: The park has a river running through it, something few parks in 
Southern California can match. It is also the site of the city of Ventura's 
water intake, which could be refurbished to allow the city to increase its 
diversions from the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Mule Deer ( Odocolleus hemionus ): Mule deer graze along river and roam 
through the area, nibbling on riverside vegetation and bedding down in the 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Least Bell's Vireo ( Vireo bellii pusillus ): Endangered least Bell's vireos 
returned to nest in the Ventura River for the first time in 85 years after 
Southern Pacific Milling Co. moved out. The county's relatively small 
populations inhabit wetlands and riparian scrub. 
</P>
<P>
 Steelhead Trout ( Salmo gairdneri irideus ): The steelhead, which is being 
considered for listing as an endangered species, was once abundant in the 
river, living in the ocean most of its life and then swimming up the Ventura 
River and Matilija Creek to spawn. Up to 200 steelhead are thought to live 
between the San Antonio Creek confluence with the Ventura River and Foster 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Beldings Savannah Sparrow ( Passerculus sandwichensis beldingi ): The only 
songbird in salt marshes, the five-inch bird nests exclusively in pickleweed. 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Marsh Baccharis ( Baccharis douglasil ): The native salt marsh is found 
in the wetlands area of the estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil Spill: In January 1993, 370,000 gallons of toxic oil byproducts that 
spilled into the ground and a nearby creek was pushed into the Ventura River by 
heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Estuary: Fish and wildlife that live or forage at the river mouth include 
the endangered tidewater goby fish, as well as California brown pelicans, the 
snowy plover, the California least tern and ospreys. 
</P>
<P>
 California Least Tern ( Sterna antillarum browni ): Colonies breed along 
coastal dunes and feed in nearby wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Snowy Plover ( Charadrius hiaticula ): These birds nest along the 
shoreline, marking and hiding their eggs with twigs and grass. 
</P>
<P>
 California Brown Pelican ( Pelecanus occidentalis californicus ): While the 
pelican breeds on the Channel Islands, it is commonly found along the county's 
coastline.

SOME BOLIVIANS FEAR RETURN OF EX-DICTATOR; SOUTH AMERICA: GARCIA MEZA IS 
EXPECTED TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON FORMER CRONIES, COLLABORATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The expected extradition of former dictator Luis Garcia Meza, under arrest in 
neighboring Brazil and wanted here to serve a 30-year prison sentence, could 
spell trouble for some Bolivians. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian police arrested Garcia Meza in Sao Paulo on March 11. Since then, 
Bolivia has been abuzz with speculation that the returning fugitive may 
incriminate many people who collaborated with his 1980-1981 regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people sweating bullets," said a foreign diplomat in La 
Paz. "I think a lot of people were hoping he would never be found." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Supreme Court began its trial for Garcia Meza in 1986 for a long list 
of crimes, he was free on his own recognizance. But when the court ordered his 
arrest in January, 1989, he went into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Before and after his conviction in absentia last year, it was common knowledge 
that Garcia Meza moved quietly around Bolivia and took trips abroad with false 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were more sightings of Garcia Meza than Elvis Presley," the diplomat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia Meza's capture has been hailed as a strong signal that military coups 
and dictatorial abuses will no longer go unpunished in Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing more of his former collaborators and later protectors to justice 
would reinforce the message. 
</P>
<P>
 But paradoxically, some analysts said, it might also destabilize Bolivia's 
democracy by stirring up political and military unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "sightings" late in 1993, the former army general had taken up 
residence in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
 The information was confirmed by an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration in Brazil, the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the DEA passed the information to Brazilian federal police, who 
tracked the fugitive down and arrested him in an apartment that he had moved 
into recently. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brazilian authorities presented Garcia Meza to reporters after his 
arrest, he said he had been writing a book that will be "a bomb," revealing 
names of people who were secretly involved in his 1980 coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivian officials say a key tip on Garcia Meza's presence in Sao Paulo came 
from a Bolivian woman living there. The woman wrote to German Quiroga, the 
Bolivian minister of government, saying she had spotted the general jogging in 
a Sao Paulo park with bodyguards. Quiroga said he passed the information on to 
the U.S. Embassy in La Paz. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiroga has told reporters that the woman deserves a $220,000 reward that had 
been offered by the Bolivian government for information leading to Garcia 
Meza's arrest. But there is a problem in paying the reward: The letter-writer 
identified herself only with initials. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia Meza seized power in a violent coup in July, 1980, that reportedly was 
backed by neo-fascists and drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 13-month regime, notoriously brutal and corrupt, at least 50 people 
were killed and 22 others disappeared after being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The former dictator and 43 officials of his regime were convicted last April 
of crimes including genocide, murder, sedition and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of those convicted are now in Bolivian prisons. About 10 are still 
fugitives, and others have won "conditional suspension" of short sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Arce Gomez, Garcia Meza's interior minister, is serving a U.S. sentence 
for drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressman Juan del Granado said dozens of other Bolivians should be tried 
for crimes under the dictatorship. In Garcia Meza's trial, Del Granado acted as 
an attorney representing Bolivia's labor federation and families of victims. He 
asked for a second trial for 75 other people, but the Supreme Court ruled 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 When Garcia Meza returns to Bolivia, he may try to incriminate past 
collaborators who have turned against him, Del Granado said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he will want to hurt people who took part in his government and now 
are with the democratic system," Del Granado said.

RIVER IS ESSENTIAL SOURCE FOR VAST ARRAY OF FISH, WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since a great upheaval of rocks and mountains created the Ventura River valley 
more than a million years ago, the river's waters have provided the essentials 
of life to plants, wildlife and humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest settlers in modern times were the Chumash Indians, who had a 
village of 400 people at the estuary and several other villages along the river 
and its tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Since those pre-mission days more than 200 years ago, homeowners, farmers, 
developers and businesses have claimed much of the Ventura River's 16-mile 
length for their own, leaving only a stretch of land at the estuary, Foster 
Park and Casitas Springs for public property. 
</P>
<P>
 But the animals that roam the night ignore property lines, prowling the river 
bottom and banks that connect the Los Padres National Forest to the north, the 
Santa Ynez Mountains to the west and Sulphur Mountain to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 "The river is a source of water, habitat and foraging grounds," said biologist 
Lawrence E. Hunt, who has spent many days walking the river. "It is essential 
to the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Mule deer drink the water and munch on the young willow stems along the 
river's edge. They browse along its banks. And after dark, they walk the 
riverbed before finding a spot to curl up for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small mule deer herd that lives in the area," just north of the Main 
Street Bridge, said Hunt. "I've seen as many as 15 of them at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobcats, coyotes, foxes, skunks and raccoons roam the river and its banks as 
well, searching for small rodents for their evening meals. Lizards scamper over 
the rocks, searching for a spot to sun by day and hunt by night. Frogs and 
snakes stay under a cool cover of vegetation during the day before emerging for 
nighttime foraging. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are bats, 2,000 to 3,000 of them, that make up one of the biggest 
bat roosts along the central coast, Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animals, like the birds of prey, hunt all along the river and its 
tributaries. Hawks are a common site circling for upward drafts above the 
Matilija forks, and ospreys can be found as far south as the river's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the river's banks, white egrets with their delicate black legs pick 
their way along the sand. Small flocks of mallards fly in noisy formation 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 The California least tern issues its piercing call as it searches for food. 
And at the estuary, hundreds of shorebirds, including the endangered California 
brown pelican, loaf in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the top of the watershed all the way down to the ocean, the Ventura 
River is one of the really valuable wildlife habitats in Southern California," 
Hunt said. Hunt is now on contract to Southern Pacific Milling Co. to write a 
restoration plan for 23 acres of the river two miles north of the Main Street 
Bridge. SP Milling Co. mined the area for its rock and sand for more than 25 
years before it pulled out of the river last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in that area last year that a pair of endangered least Bell's vireos 
nested for the first time in 85 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They moved in as soon as the human disturbance from the sand and gravel 
mining moved out; it was no coincidence," Hunt said. "It is a sign that the 
area is capable of supporting this endangered species." 
</P>
<P>
 It was two years ago when he first heard the distinctive call of the male 
flying around singing to attract a mate. 
</P>
<P>
 As if through clenched teeth, seeming to ask a question and then answer 
itself, the tiny songbird sings, "Cheedle cheedle chee? Cheedle cheedle chew!"  
</P>
<P>
 The vireo is among 237 species of birds that have been sited in the lower 
eight miles of the river alone. No studies have been done to document species 
on the upper half of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, sensitive species include the western snowy plover and the yellow 
warbler, the yellow-breasted chat, the tricolored blackbird, the western 
yellow-billed cuckoo, the California least tern, the Peregrine falcon, the 
Belding's savannah sparrow and the California brown pelican. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists have also found at least 12 other species -- six bird, three fish, 
two reptile and one mammal -- listed by state or federal agencies as 
endangered, threatened, or species of special concern or special animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish include the tidewater goby, newly listed this month as endangered, and 
the once-abundant southern steelhead trout, which is being considered for 
endangered species status all along the Pacific coast. The endangered arroyo 
chub is also found in the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists have counted two kinds of amphibians, four reptile species, and 23 
species of mammals in the lower eight miles of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Endangered or rare reptiles and amphibians include the Southwestern pond 
turtle, the California red-legged frog and the two-striped garter snake. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several species of plants that are threatened with extinction as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 But what difference if a tiny and obscure fish like the tidewater goby becomes 
extinct, or even the steelhead, which once was so plentiful in the river that 
children caught them with pitchforks? 
</P>
<P>
 "If one species is lost, you really don't know what the effect on other 
species will be," Hunt said. "You can get a domino effect where the whole 
system degrades. Then you are left with a few common species." 
</P>
<P>
 And if one species is allowed to go extinct because it is too much work to 
save it or humans need its habitat, it could too easily become the norm, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you draw the line; when do you stop and say, 'OK, we've lost enough 
species?' " he asked. "There has to be a balance."

TURNING WHEELS INTO THE FUTURE; NASCENT ADVANCED TRANSIT INDUSTRY IS STARTING 
TO GENERATE JOBS AND PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While economists brew prophecies of the jobs that could be created by an 
advanced transportation industry in California, Ralph C. Valdez already has 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez, one of the tens of thousands of economic casualties of the Cold War's 
end, spent more than 14 years hand-forming aircraft parts at McDonnell Douglas 
before he was laid off more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he reports each morning to a freshly painted workshop on Olympic Boulevard 
in East Los Angeles where he fashions parts for buses, trucks and cars as they 
are converted from gasoline or diesel fuel to natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming from a Fortune 500 company, I wanted to hook up with a company like 
this that's going to be on the rise," Valdez, 45, says of NGV Ecotrans, his new 
employer. "I can't wait for it to go public so I can buy stock." 
</P>
<P>
 The new company -- a joint venture of NGV Systems Inc., a Long Beach-based 
natural gas technologies developer, and Ecotrans Aftermarket Corp., a 
subsidiary of Southern California Gas Co. -- just opened for full production, 
with contracts to convert more than 900 vehicles this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30 jobs it has created -- and the 70 others likely to be added over the 
next three years -- don't by themselves do much to replace the 200,000 
California jobs estimated to have been lost in the defense downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet NGV Ecotrans is but the latest in a quiet wave of companies that are 
finding profit -- and jobs -- in the expansion of mass transportation and in 
state and federal mandates for cleaner vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the jobs are being added in dribs and drabs, and the wages 
rarely match those in the lost aerospace positions, many of which were union. 
</P>
<P>
 But skilled jobs like those at NGV Ecotrans are what economists dream of when 
they talk about establishing new manufacturing industries in beleaguered 
Southern California. And transportation technology companies are starting to 
add workers.

 Calstart -- the public-private consortium attempting to foster an advanced 
transportation industry in the state -- recently polled 33 member companies, 
about a third of its membership. The companies reported investing $229 million 
and creating 1,041 new jobs in advanced transportation projects, mostly in 
electric vehicle technologies. They expect to create 8,917 new jobs by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be the new economic base for the region," says Mark Pisano, 
executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments (SCAG). 
</P>
<P>
 AlliedSignal Inc.'s Torrance facility, for example, is developing a civilian 
version of what's called a turbogenerator -- a simple, highly efficient turbine 
that has only one moving part and uses no polluting lubricants because it 
rotates on air bearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed to run the lights, computers and other auxiliary systems on military 
tanks, it can generate electricity for electric vehicles from compressed 
natural gas, liquid natural gas, diesel, reformulated gasoline or methanol -- 
"basically about any fuel you can think of," says Mary Gerstner, the program 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 While only 30 AlliedSignal employees are now working on turbogenerators, the 
company expects the project to add 1,000 jobs by 2005, with more potential 
growth beyond that. The same facility has five engineers working on fuel cells, 
another technology in which AlliedSignal sees great potential. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Torrance plant of Hughes Power Control Systems, more than 200 
engineering and manufacturing employees are at work on electric vehicle 
components -- from drive systems to the electronics for special power-steering 
and air-conditioning units. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a whole slew of components that change when you go to an electric 
vehicle, because you lose your fan belt," says Fred Silver, marketing manager 
for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 100 engineering employees at other GM Hughes Electronics subsidiaries 
in Southern California are developing systems that provide vehicles with 
sunlight-bright light at night or put printed information on the windshield so 
drivers don't have to look down to consult maps. And Hughes researchers in 
Malibu are doing longer-range work on other aspects of transportation 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the prognosticators continue to expect a rosy future for new 
transportation businesses in California. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2000, California could generate 10,000 jobs from electric vehicles and 
225,000 in advanced transportation as a whole, according to Project California, 
Gov. Pete Wilson's blue-ribbon committee to encourage advanced transportation 
and telecommunications industries. The group projects the total rising to 
409,000 jobs by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Calstart, meanwhile, says that if California can corral a third of the 
worldwide electric vehicle component industry, that would create 55,000 jobs by 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 And the latest estimates available -- in a draft report by SCAG's advanced 
transportation technology task force -- show equal if not greater promise. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2010, the task force estimates, 355,000 jobs could be created in five 
fields: making electric vehicle components, converting or servicing other 
alternative-fuel vehicles, manufacturing the myriad components of an 
intelligent transportation system, telecommuting and what the task force is 
terming the "smart shuttle" -- a high-tech version of today's airport shuttle, 
which would serve individuals traveling throughout the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting such projections "is going to be very, very difficult," acknowledges 
task force chairman John C. Cox Jr., a Newport Beach city councilman. "There's 
going to be worldwide production of these things. It's a question of how 
competitive we can be in California, to produce the best products at the best 
price." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there are competitors everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Eco Expo, an annual environmental business trade show that runs April 
8-10 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, Westinghouse Naval Systems -- of 
Cleveland -- will show off its own defense conversion products, including an 
electric scooter and, reportedly, an electric lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 "The start-up is the big hump to get over," says Goetz Wolff, a labor market 
economist whose firm, Resources for Employment and Economic Development, is 
based in Los Angeles. "The question is whether all the pieces are in place to 
get a start-up." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, it's one job at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough for us," says NGV Ecotrans worker Robert A. Serpas, 27, 
another veteran of McDonnell Douglas layoffs who has struggled to make ends 
meet for his wife and two children. "But we're doing all right now. We've got a 
lot of future with this company -- if it takes off."

KEY DISCOVERY BOOSTS IMAGE OF AGOURON; BIOTECHNOLOGY: LA JOLLA PHARMACEUTICAL 
COMPANY ZEROING IN ON CURE FOR THE COMMON COLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the kind of scientific breakthrough biotechnology companies dream about: 
a discovery that could lead to the development of a drug for treating the 
common cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Agouron Pharmaceuticals' announcement March 11 that it had discovered the 
structure of an enzyme critical to reproduction of viruses that frequently 
cause colds boosted its profile on Wall Street. The research breakthrough was 
one of a series of successes that have driven up Agouron's market value 21.3% 
since Dec. 31. The company's stock closed at $14.25 in Friday's trading on 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery does not ensure that Agouron will develop an effective 
cold-fighting drug -- that won't be known for several years at least. Still, 
the prospect of having a blockbuster in sight has created lots of excitement at 
the company, whose researchers are also working on treatments to combat AIDS, 
cancer and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very strong and exhilarating sensation that the technology . . . 
we set out to develop a decade ago is beginning to boil to the surface in some 
dramatic ways," said Peter Johnson, Agouron's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery is "potentially very important," said Jim McCamant, the 
Berkeley-based editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter. "One of the 
intriguing things is that it provides the promise of a solution to a medical 
problem that has been insolvable." 
</P>
<P>
 Another analyst who likes Agouron, Ed Hurwitz of Smith Barney Shearson in San 
Francisco, recently wrote that it is "one of the most undervalued and 
overlooked companies in the biotechnology industry." 
</P>
<P>
 That is high praise for a company without a drug on the market and none 
nearing Food and Drug Administration approval. But industry observers say 
Agouron's recent announcement is all the more impressive because it follows 
several recent successes in research and corporate strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Agouron announced a key financing agreement with the 
pharmaceutical division of Japan Tobacco Inc. under which it would double its 
maximum investment in Agouron to more than $56 million, provided certain 
research milestones are met. Japan Tobacco, which already owns 2% of the firm, 
is a diversified company based in Japan with $23 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will provide funding for research on drugs to treat and prevent 
common upper respiratory infections, hepatitis C and herpes. Japan Tobacco will 
gain exclusive marketing rights to the drugs in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, however, Agouron retained exclusive worldwide marketing rights 
to the anti-rhinoviral drugs -- those for treating colds and other upper 
respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Jolla-based firm was also able to negotiate a highly favorable deal 
with research partner Eli Lilly late last year involving drugs for fighting 
HIV, the AIDS virus. Lilly handed over to Agouron all worldwide commercial 
rights to its anti-HIV drugs in exchange for receiving proprietary details of 
Agouron's recent discovery related to the common cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal means that the much larger Lilly will become a competitor of Agouron 
in the race to develop a treatment for colds and other respiratory ailments. 
Nevertheless, Johnson said he was delighted by the agreement. "While we don't 
underestimate Lilly," he said, "we have a great deal of expertise and are quite 
comfortable with our ability to compete successfully.' 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements with Japan Tobacco and Lilly are significant because they 
enable Agouron to reap broader commercial benefits -- that is, profit -- if it 
can bring new drugs to market. More commonly, young biotechnology firms 
sacrifice commercial rights to their partners, usually big drug companies, in 
exchange for financing or research assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Agouron is considered one of the leaders in developing a new class of AIDS 
drugs known as protease inhibitors, which aim to stop HIV from producing an 
enzyme key to its replication. "We believe they are the most potent anti-HIV 
agents in the world," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly, but the drugs haven't yet been tested on humans. The company hopes 
to begin first-phase clinical trials -- the first of several steps to drug 
approval, dealing only with safety and dosage -- later this year. Drug maker 
Hoffman-La Roche recently began the first large-scale human studies of a 
protease inhibitor for use against HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Further along in development are several anti-cancer drugs, which are just 
completing first-phase trials in the United States and Europe. In a separate 
project, Agouron is working with pharmaceutical giant Schering-Plough Corp. on 
another cancer-related research project. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Agouron's drug development process has not always worked. In 
mid-1993, the company suspended development of an anti-psoriasis therapy after 
it proved ineffective in human clinical studies. The psoriasis treatment worked 
in a similar manner to attack the skin disorder as do Agouron's cancer drugs. 
But company officials say they remain confident that the anti-cancer drugs can 
be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Agouron's discovery of the structure of the cold-related enzyme, rhinovirus 3C 
protease, involved a highly sophisticated technique known as X-ray 
crystallography. The company said the discovery enables researchers to prepare 
an atom-by-atom design of a drug that would block the enzyme and inhibit 
replication of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, drug development would be targeted at treating infections in 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, such as emphysema and 
chronic bronchitis, which afflict about 13.8 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson said the drug might also be used to prevent infections in people 
exposed to a cold virus and to relieve or eliminate symptoms more quickly. As 
an asthma sufferer, he said, he personally looks forward to such a drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, a heavy cold can give me bronchial asthma," Johnson said. "It can 
knock me out of the box for two to three weeks, and I have children." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he has fielded a flurry of phone calls about the recent discovery 
and has been pleased by the response. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had very few people who have called and said, 'I understand you've 
cured the common cold.' People understand it was an important step in that 
direction, but there is a good deal of work that lies ahead."

OFF THE TICKER: RARE BANK NOTES, GOING, GOING . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A collection of rare 19th-Century bank notes and printers' proofs goes on the 
block this week at Christie's. 
</P>
<P>
 The J.W. Middendorf II collection features notes issued by wildcat banks 
before the Civil War. The notes give vivid snapshots of the nation's past: 
</P>
<P>
 * A $100 note printed by the Bank of Rhode Island in Newport depicts the 
Battle of Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 * A $10 note from the Bank of Selma in Selma, Ala., pictures workers loading 
bales of cotton onto a wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lamb of Christie's called the sale a natural move for a distinguished 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
 "A collector," he said, "having taken private pleasure from building it, wants 
some sort of recognition for having done it."

 Last Friday came the news that the latest victim of Southern California's soft 
economy is luxury-loving celebrity Zsa Zsa Gabor, who sought U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court protection because of cash flow problems and legal judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, here are a few of the details from the court papers that were being 
processed Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gabor's total assets are listed as $325,694, with total liabilities pegged 
at $3.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gabor's assets include $20,000 in clothes, $20,000 in jewelry, $15,000 in 
furs, $50,000 in furniture, $119,402 in a Merrill Lynch cash management account 
and a $7,500 Chevrolet pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 * Her unsecured creditors include famed lawyer Melvin Belli for $150,000 in 
legal services, a claim Gabor disputes. Others include Bloomingdale's for 
$2,800 and a limousine company for $300. 
</P>
<P>
 * Her Bel-Air mansion and a Camarillo area ranch are listed at unknown values, 
although Home Savings has a secured claim on the home for $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gabor's monthly income is estimated to be $25,696. She gets $31,788 a year 
combined from Social Security and from pensions with the Screen Actors Guild 
and the Equity League. 
</P>
<P>
 * Her monthly expenses are $22,835, including $10,099 in mortgage payments, 
$3,500 for food and a $275 phone bill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gabor claims she suffered $70,000 in earthquake damage to personal items. To 
Be Continued Someday 
</P>
<P>
 The March issue of Spy magazine includes an expose on organized crime in 
Hollywood by writer John Connolly that ends curiously with the sentence: "This 
is Part I in a series of articles on Hollywood and the New Mob." 
</P>
<P>
 The reference is puzzling since Spy is folding, with no new issues to come. So 
what becomes of Part II? "Your guess is as good as mine," says Connolly, who 
said he may publish it as part of a book. All Hype Being Equal 
</P>
<P>
 Maverick movie producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer -- makers of such 
big-budget films as "Top Gun" and "Beverly Hills Cop" -- seem to have an equal 
partnership right down to the hyperbole in publicity materials for their new 
comeback film, "The Ref." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's biography reads: "In the 1980s Don Simpson was responsible for some 
of entertainment's most popular and enduring motion pictures. In the 1990s, 
this exceptional and unique producer will undoubtedly continue to bring to 
audiences worldwide, films that thrill excite and delight." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, Bruckheimer's separate biography reads: "In the 1980s Jerry 
Bruckheimer was responsible for some of entertainment's most popular and 
enduring motion pictures. In the 1990s, this exceptional and unique producer 
will undoubtedly continue to bring audiences worldwide, films that thrill, 
excite and delight." Briefly. . . 
</P>
<P>
 And the winners are . . . : The Los Angeles advertising firm Ellis + Ross, 
which designed tonight's Academy Awards program, says it is giving out a few 
surplus copies to people "with the right connections."

U.S., JAPAN IN NEW ROW OVER LANDING RIGHTS; AIRLINES: JAL'S REQUEST TO 
INAUGURATE A ROUTE BETWEEN SENDAI AND HONOLULU SPARKED THE LATEST DISPUTE IN AN 
ONGOING QUARREL OVER A 1952 TREATY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S.-Japan dispute over air service rights is heating up as Tokyo seeks 
changes in what it views as an unfair 1952 agreement and American carriers try 
to expand Pacific Rim services under the old rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest point of friction comes from a Japan Airlines request to inaugurate 
a route between the northern city of Sendai and Honolulu beginning last 
Thursday. The U.S. Department of Transportation declined to take any action on 
the route request before Thursday, though it did give last-minute, one-time 
approval for a charter flight to carry the 275 passengers who had already 
booked tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuo Toshimitsu, president of Japan Airlines, described Washington's 
reluctance to approve the new service as "extremely regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
 The quarrel then escalated. The U.S. had previously decided that the licenses 
for transpacific flights of three Japanese airlines would be extended only half 
a year at a time, rather than a full year, as has been the practice. Japan's 
Transport Ministry responded Friday by announcing the same treatment for U.S. 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of the controversy is a 42-year-old civil aviation agreement -- 
drawn up at a time when Japan did not have its own international airline -- 
that allows U.S. carriers flying to Japan to pick up passengers for 
destinations in Southeast Asia and Australia and permits Japanese carriers to 
fly from the United States to South America. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, economic growth in Southeast Asia has made these routes 
extremely lucrative for U.S. airlines, which carry a high percentage of 
passengers picked up in Japan, while the onward flights to South America are of 
much less value to the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo has made efforts at least since 1975 to get the agreement changed, but 
Washington has steadfastly refused. Now, however, Japan may have new leverage 
with the scheduled opening in September of Kansai Airport, a large facility 
serving the Osaka area that will be Japan's first 24-hour airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Several U.S. carriers would like to expand their operations into Osaka once 
the airport opens, but Japan has refused to approve any increases outside the 
context of broader negotiations on revising the 1952 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common view in Japan is (that) the U.S. carriers have enough already, and 
they keep wanting more, and it's about time this was changed," said Geoffrey 
Tudor, a Japan Airlines spokesman in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. carriers hold about 70% of the transpacific market, even though about 85% 
of the passengers on these routes are Japanese, Tudor said. At Narita 
International Airport, the key facility serving Tokyo, U.S. carriers hold slots 
for about 800 arrivals or departures, with about 500 of these used for flights 
to or from the United States and 300 for flights to or from destinations beyond 
Japan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, Japanese carriers have about 850 slots, with 300 used 
for U.S. flights and the rest for their connections to the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor said that in the Japanese view, these statistics show that U.S. airlines 
are making an unreasonably large number of flights that are not between the 
United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. carriers such as United Airlines and Federal Express, a provider of 
freight services, feel they have the right to more flights beyond Japan than 
Tokyo allows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been trying to exercise our right to fly from New York to Narita with 
a through service to Sydney," said James C. Brennan, a Tokyo-based vice 
president for United Airlines. "That's something we . . . desire to do. It's 
somewhere embedded in those discussions between the two governments." 
</P>
<P>
 The airline controversy has no direct connection to other bilateral trade 
disputes, but disagreements over how the two governments should respond to 
Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States -- which hit $59.3 billion 
last year -- may affect the atmosphere for talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor could be the great financial pressure many airlines face, due 
partly to overcapacity and price wars. Japan Airlines expects a loss of about 
$282 million for the fiscal year that ends March 31. It has announced plans to 
cut 5,000 jobs over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Susumu Yamaji, chairman of Japan Airlines, recently told reporters that there 
should be a new bilateral agreement that "reflects today's conditions instead 
of the positions of 40 years ago."

GE CAPITAL INCREASES THE HEAT IN BID FOR KEMPER; MERGER: GENERAL ELECTRIC UNIT 
REQUESTS LIST OF SHAREHOLDERS FOR DIRECT DISCUSSION OF ITS $2.35 BILLION 
TAKEOVER ATTEMPT. A $55-PER-SHARE OFFER WAS REJECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Turning up the pressure on Kemper Corp., GE Capital on Sunday asked the asset 
management company to turn over its list of shareholders so it could go 
directly to them to discuss its $2.35 billion takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are requesting a Kemper shareholder list so that we may communicate 
directly with them and let them make the determination regarding our proposal," 
GE Capital Chairman Gary Wendt said in a letter to Kemper Chairman David 
Mathis. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, Kemper's board formally rejected the GE bid of $55 a share, 
saying it felt its shareholders would be better served if the company remained 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Electric Co. unit said that in light of Kemper's action, it had no 
choice but to go directly to the stockholders -- all but indicating that the 
bid would turn hostile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were disappointed at your continued refusal even to discuss our $55 per 
share cash merger proposal," Wendt wrote in the letter released by GE. 
</P>
<P>
 "By your refusal you leave us no choice but to proceed unilaterally and 
communicate directly with our fellow shareholders who surely will feel the 
time-sensitive urgency to consummate this transaction as promptly as possible 
or risk seeing their values decline," Wendt wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 GE has previously said it had not approached any Kemper shareholders nor tried 
in any way to pressure the Long Brook, Ill.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wendt disclosed in the letter that GE had been rebuffed by Kemper at every 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
 GE first approached Kemper on March 2 in a private letter to Mathis. The bid 
was rejected two days later. Then last week, GE made public its interest in 
Kemper, sending the fund company's stock soaring. Kemper rejected the public 
overture on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect GE will eventually raise its offer -- perhaps to as high as 
$70 per share -- and investors will gladly accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper shares closed Friday up 37.5 cents at $61.125 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 When GE Capital on March 14 made its bid public, it said it "might increase 
the price if, after a review of Kemper's real estate portfolio, it seemed 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper manages $70 billion in investors' funds, nearly 10 times as much as GE 
Capital, including $48 billion in the fast-growing mutual fund business. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper's real estate holdings have been valued as high as $1.5 billion, but 
have proven a major drag on the company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, it said its real estate segment had a net loss of $257.7 million 
in 1993, compared with a net loss of $209.1 million for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital has been very astute at buying assets burdened by excessive debt 
loads, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 With its large cash surplus generated from other segments of its business, GE 
Capital can afford to refinance the Kemper real estate assets, manage them and 
then await higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital hopes to apply this expertise to the Kemper portfolio, but analysts 
believe Kemper's mutual fund business is GE Capital's primary goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe any other company could get as much out of a buyout of 
Kemper as GE Capital can," said analyst Mike Lewis of Dean Witter.

 Michigan, Wal-Mart Settle Advertising Complaint: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has 
settled the latest in a series of charges over the fairness of its prices and 
advertising, agreeing to change signs that three Michigan competitors claimed 
were misleading.The nation's No. 1 retailer reached the agreement with state 
Atty. Gen. Frank Kelley. Kelley had threatened to sue the Bentonville, Ark., 
retailer after complaints last year by Kmart Corp. and Target Stores, along 
with Meijer Inc., a Michigan retailer. Wal-Mart agreed to change the way it 
compares prices with other stores and to update price comparisons weekly, 
Kelley said. Wal-Mart didn't admit any guilt and won't pay any fines.

 Swiss Ease Flow of Bank Information: Switzerland's Parliament passed a law 
that tightens bank regulations and eases the international flow of information 
among bank regulators.The law, modeled on European Union directives, allows 
Swiss bank regulators to pass on information about a bank or, in some cases, a 
bank client, to foreign regulators and criminal investigators. This will allow 
bank officials to work around Switzerland's bank secrecy laws, which forbid the 
release of client information unless police or a court order it. If the 
information involves a bank client, the client must be informed and can try to 
stop the release by taking the case to court.

 Saudis Open Talks With Aircraft Makers: Saudi Arabia's national airline, 
Saudia, started separate discussions with Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. on its planned purchase of about 50 American aircraft worth $6 billion. 
An Arab industry expert predicted the talks, held at the Red Sea port of 
Jeddah, could be long and tough to get the best possible deal for 
Saudia.Details of the agreement, including the share between Boeing and 
McDonnell Douglas, financing, numbers of aircraft and delivery schedules, are 
to be negotiated. A buoyant President Clinton announced last month that Riyadh 
had awarded American aircraft makers an order for at least 50 planes. The news 
shocked European makers, who had lobbied for months to gain a share of the 
deal.

MOTORCYCLE PRODUCTION REVVING UP IN CHINA; MANUFACTURING: THE NATION PASSED 
JAPAN AS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MAKER. GREATER DEMAND IS SEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China has overtaken Japan as the world's biggest maker of motorcycles -- but 
the market is dominated by models developed by three Japanese manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese production lines turned out a record 3.37 million cycles in 1993, 
while Japanese factories built 3.197 million. The gap is expected to widen this 
year with demand strong in China but weak in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect sales here to grow 15% a year until the end of the century," said 
Kazukimi Kojima, representative of Honda Motor Co. in Beijing. "There is no 
market like this in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima said Honda has first place in China, with a 37% share of the market 
held by firms with which it has technical cooperation agreements or joint 
venture agreements, followed by Yamaha at 26% and Suzuki with 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese output has soared from fewer than 50,000 machines in 1980 to 1.34 
million in 1991 and 2.05 million in 1992, according to official figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda was the first Japanese maker to arrive when it signed a technical 
cooperation agreement in January, 1982. Its rivals followed and now Honda, 
Yamaha and Suzuki have a total of 18 plants here using their capital or 
technology. Kawasaki has no plants in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two factories are appropriately in Chongqing in southwest China, a 
city so hilly that it is not suitable for the hardy bicycle, of which China has 
400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a joint venture with Honda and the other with Yamaha, reminiscent of 
the five-year Honda-Yamaha war in Japan, where motorcycle output peaked at 7.41 
million in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The main markets in China are in cities in the south and on the coast, where 
residents use motorcycles to go to work, and in villages where the cycles are 
used to carry goods as well as people. 
</P>
<P>
 Guangdong has 860,000 privately owned motorcycles, the most of any province. 
But nationwide, fewer than eight people per 1,000 own motorcycles, compared to 
a world average of 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have entered the golden age of China's motorcycles, in the footsteps of 
Japan, Taiwan and elsewhere in their period of economic takeoff," the Economic 
Daily wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no market in the world that can compare with China. If we do not 
develop production rapidly, large-scale imports and smuggling are inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Experience shows that sales of motorcycles begin when per-capita income 
reaches $300 a year and soar when it reaches $1,000. That is the income level 
in Guangzhou, where most households have bought most of the appliances they 
want. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Chinese still prefer imported models. With an import duty of 150%, they 
cost more than $1,150, against $805 to $1,030 for the popular 70cc model 
produced by Jialing, Honda's partner in Chongqing. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Japan legally exported 460,633 motorcycles to China, up from 297,260 
in 1992. Many are also smuggled in to escape the duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand is limited by government directive. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about worsening traffic chaos, many cities limit the use of 
motorcycles, with Beijing among the most strict. Other cities issue only a 
certain number of licenses per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Another limiting factor is the price of fuel, likely to rise sharply as China 
moves to discourage consumption because domestic output cannot keep pace with 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 For Japanese such as Honda's Kojima, this explosive growth in output carries a 
somber message. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1950s, we Japanese were the students and the U.S. the teacher," he 
said. "Now we are the teacher and the Chinese the students. How are we to avoid 
the decline of the U.S. and Europe? We must work even harder to develop new 
technology and new products. 
</P>
<P>
 "If China reaches the standard of Japan, we have no future."

 Profitable Qantas May Be Easier to Sell: Qantas Airways reported a healthy 
return to profitability last week, raising prospects that the government may 
sell its 75% stake in the airline this year.The national carrier reported a net 
profit of $50.8 million for the six months ended Dec. 31, contrasted with a 
loss of $259.5 million in the first half of the 1993 fiscal year. Analysts 
expect the government to raise more than $1.42 billion from the sale of its 
stake, based on a net profit for the airline of $106.5 million in 1993-94 and a 
net profit forecast of $177.5 million in 1994-95. British Airways has a 25% 
stake in the carrier.

 Rail Investment to Be Pared by a Third: The government has cut its planned 
investment in railway construction this year to $3.3 billion, the official 
China Daily reported.China had originally planned to invest $4.8 billion to 
ease transport bottlenecks, the newspaper said. No reason was given for the 
cutback. In January, China moved to curtail investment in new construction 
projects to curb inflation, but it said infrastructure projects would not be 
affected. The new construction budget is 28% higher than the 1993 budget for 
rail improvements, China Daily quoted the Railways Ministry as saying.

 Honda Gets Tough With Managers: The auto maker said it would start a tough new 
personnel policy threatening unproductive managers with demotion and pay cuts, 
a move analysts said is part of a broader trend whittling away at Japan's 
once-vaunted lifetime employment system. Under Honda Motor Co.'s new program, 
managers who fail to win promotion within eight to 12 years will be demoted and 
their salaries cut 10% to 30%, a Honda spokesman said. Honda's move echoes 
changes at other car companies which, faced with weak demand and overcapacity, 
are struggling to cut costs, improve management flexibility and link pay 
packets more closely to performance rather than seniority alone.

 Industrial Production Figures Adjusted Upward: The Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry said industrial production rose slightly more in January 
than previous data indicated.The revision of production, shipments and 
inventory figures by the ministry adds weight to the view that Japan's economy 
is pulling out of a long recession. Output at Japan's factories grew a revised 
1.0% in January, instead of the earlier estimate of 0.9%, the ministry said. 
Production of machinery, particularly computers and semiconductors, boosted 
output, a ministry official said.

 State Control of Economy to Be Eased: The government said it will reduce its 
direct control of key economic sectors by forming semiautonomous alliances of 
corporations.The alliances, consisting of at least seven major companies each, 
will manage their own operations rather than relying on the direction of 
government ministries, the state-run Vietnam News reported. Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet, a leading advocate of free market reforms, will appoint the managers 
of each group, the newspaper said. The first corporate groupings will be 
established in June on a trial basis.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: TURMOIL KEEPS MONEY OUT OF MEXICAN STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Herzfeld believes the time to buy into so-called emerging stock markets 
is when they're down, especially on political upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Miami-based money manager still doesn't want to buy Mexico, despite 
that stock market's steep plunge this year tied to the ballooning problems of 
Mexico's ruling party, the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Herzfeld isn't enamored of any of the Latin American markets that 
have tumbled since mid-February, including Chile and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll have a chance to buy them cheaper later," he says. "There's 
nothing really compelling about them now." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Holiber, analyst at D.A. Campbell Co., a Los Angeles brokerage that 
specializes in Latin American stocks, says the Mexican market's slide in 
particular has "all the characteristics of a panic" that hasn't run its course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican Stock Exchange's Bolsa index, which eased 13.66 points on Friday 
to 2,363.01, has plummeted 18% from its all-time high of 2,881.17 on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The market was able to overcome the initial surprise of the anti-government 
uprising in Mexico's southern Chiapas state in early January. But by 
mid-February, foreign investors began to focus on the severity of the Chiapas 
crisis' political fallout for the PRI and outgoing President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest aftershock from Chiapas: Manuel Camacho Solis, whom Salinas named 
to negotiate for the government with the rebels, is considering entering this 
year's presidential race on the ticket of one of Mexico's smaller political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a direct challenge to the supremacy of the PRI, whose handpicked 
candidate to succeed Salinas is 43-year-old Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 For foreign investors who since fall have focused only on what's right with 
Mexico -- especially the long-term economic promise born of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement -- Camacho has become a reminder that the country's 
political evolution may not follow the PRI's rigid script. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico still is a democracy in name only, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not at all used to political fracturing or plurality in their 
system," says Holiber. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the Chiapas uprising -- and the apparent kidnaping last Monday of 
one of the country's top bankers, Alfredo Harp Helu -- have revived painful 
discussions about how relatively little wealth generated by the country's 
economic revival has actually trickled down to the peasant masses. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market's worst nightmare is that Camacho, if he runs, could take 
enough votes away from Colosio to throw the August election to a left-wing 
candidate. That would raise the specter of re-nationalization of industry and a 
rejection of the NAFTA treaty in whole or in part. 
</P>
<P>
 If the backdrop for the PRI's woes was a healthy economy, the stock market 
might have been able to deal better with election fears. But it didn't help 
that 1993 saw the lowest level of real economic growth (0.4%) in Mexico in 
seven years, in part because of uncertainty about NAFTA's passage in the United 
States for most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy's slowdown depressed Mexican corporate profits in the second half 
of the year, and those lousy profit reports put added downward pressure on 
stock prices in late February and into this month, Holiber says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the back of many investors' minds is that all of this may well be 
transitory -- and that the odds favor Mexican stock prices being sharply higher 
two to three years from now, if the economy returns to the fast track. The 
question then is, how low should investors allow Mexican stock prices to get in 
this selloff before jumping back in? 
</P>
<P>
 The market's current average price-to-earnings ratio, as calculated by the 
Mexican Investment Board, is about 18 based on 1993 earnings, which isn't 
exactly dirt-cheap. Assuming earnings improve this year, the 1994 P-E is lower, 
of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiber, however, warns that first-quarter earnings, which will be reported in 
April and May, probably won't be encouraging. But that may not be a big 
problem, he says, only because by now, "nobody is holding out any hope that the 
first-quarter numbers are going to be good." 
</P>
<P>
 What worries Holiber and other U.S. investors is that the Mexican market's 
decline so far has been more a function of a sudden lack of buying than a 
result of heavy selling. That suggests that many investors who may want to cash 
out of their Mexican stocks haven't yet been given an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk now is that a sudden wave of buying by bargain hunters will 
immediately bring an avalanche of shares onto the market from desperate 
sellers, sending the market into a new tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any increase in prices becomes an opportunity to sell," warns Luis Maizel, 
head of LM Capital Management in La Jolla, who just returned from a week in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiber says such a selloff would complete the panic cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is that we're within 10% of the bottom," he says. A 10% decline 
in the Bolsa from here would drop it to about 2,130, which is where it was just 
before NAFTA was approved by Congress in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 Maizel, who says he liquidated many of his Mexican holdings immediately after 
the New Year's Day uprising in Chiapas, believes the Bolsa could fall as low as 
2,000 in a final panic selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maizel says he intends to begin buying again around 2,200. He expects the 
PRI's Colosio to win the election this summer, restoring big investors' faith 
in the country's ability to stay on a long-term growth path. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Maizel admits that his visits with Mexican executives and officials 
last week revealed surprising apprehension about the future, especially in 
light of the Chiapas uprising and President Salinas' decision to try and talk 
through a deal with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't like the government negotiating with a guy wearing a mask and a 
gun," Maizel says, noting that the rebels have kept their identities secret as 
they have pressed for more government aid to poor peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 While many American institutional investors have so far looked upon the 
Chiapas incident as a local problem with few long-term implications for Mexico, 
Maizel says his trip to Mexico last week left him "concerned that this is a 
little bit more serious than what (foreign investors) had been looking at." 
</P>

Juarez, the symbol of Mexican liberation in the 1800s. Mexican Shares Tumble

 Phoenix investor Wesley Phillips made his first foray into bond mutual funds 
last year. So far, his experience hasn't been an especially pleasant one. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips' adventure began in May, when he started moving money out of 
certificates of deposit into two Franklin tax-free funds in search of higher 
returns. He later added to those positions and put some cash into a third fund, 
Franklin Income, which holds bonds and higher-yielding stocks.

 Although all three funds have good track records, that was of little 
consolation when interest rates started to push higher in October and 
accelerated their rise in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Because interest rates move inversely to bond prices, the latest trend has 
hurt nearly all bond fund investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understood (at the time of purchase) that bond funds could fluctuate in 
price," says Phillips, who invested $250,000 in the three funds and has lost 
nearly $4,000 in principal, excluding the sales commissions he paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I didn't realize that interest rates were so low they could only go up." 
</P>
<P>
 In this sense, he's not alone. Investors pumped a record $144 billion into 
bond funds in 1993 and many of them, like Phillips, may be wondering if they 
can ever recoup their paper losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, of course, is yes. Bond funds can appreciate as quickly as they 
have dropped in recent weeks, assuming the interest rate trend turns favorable. 
The hard part, of course, is predicting whether that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Anderson, branch manager at brokerage Diversified Securities in Tustin, 
says he's modestly concerned about rising interest rates and is cautioning his 
clients about government bond funds, which have a somewhat undeserved 
reputation for being "safe." While the bonds owned by these funds aren't going 
to go into default -- eliminating one type of risk -- they nevertheless would 
be hurt by rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Frazier Evans, senior economist for the Colonial fund group in Boston, 
offers a more optimistic outlook. He expects to see a bond market rally 
developing by the second half of 1994, fueled by three catalysts: continuing 
low inflation, a shrinking federal deficit and a slowing economy later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Richard Schlanger, a bond fund manager for the Boston-based Pioneer 
group, thinks this year's bond market slide has been overdone. He sees the 
possibility of "rough water ahead followed by a calm." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of your forecast for interest rates, it's important to diversify 
your bond fund holdings among different segments of the market. For example, 
Anderson and Evans like the idea of multisector or flexible bond funds, which 
tend to hold a mix of U.S. government bonds, foreign government bonds and 
lower-rated or "junk" domestic debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax-exempt municipal bond funds also remain attractive despite lower prices in 
recent weeks, say Evans and Anderson. Higher tax rates this year have boosted 
demand for these securities, while the supply of new bonds coming to market is 
expected to contract to $180 billion this year from a record $290 billion in 
1993, according to Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, risk-shy investors should be careful not to put all their marbles 
in long-term bond funds. Though short-term portfolios pay lower yields, they 
don't get bruised as much when interest rates do rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative investors, even retirees, might also consider having a small 
stake in stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For clients who don't have to live off every dime of income, Anderson 
recommends some stock fund holdings as a longer-term inflation hedge and 
diversification move. 
</P>
<P>
 As a general rule, Evans suggests subtracting your age from 110, and putting 
that much of your portfolio in stock funds. For Phillips, 70, that would work 
out to a 40% equity stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter in 
Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y., also recommends a 40% stake in stock funds, 
including those that venture into international markets, within his retirement 
model portfolio. He suggests another 20% in income funds, which are dominated 
by bonds but also include some equity holdings, and just 40% in pure bond 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the new Stagecoach LifePath 2000 Fund from San Francisco-based 
Wells Fargo Bank is more conservative. This portfolio is designed for people in 
their 50s and 60s who anticipate they will retire or otherwise need the money 
around the year 2000. Though its allocation mix will fluctuate, the fund is 
expected to maintain a stock exposure of about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 And you could come up with many more allocation examples for conservative 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The main point is to realize that the vast majority of fixed-income funds will 
drop in price if interest rates continue to rise. Yet the extent of price 
damage will vary by the average maturity and types of bonds held, which makes 
diversification a good rule for even risk-shy individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Century City-based Pilgrim Group of mutual funds has lost its court battle 
with mutual fund rating service Morningstar Inc. of Chicago, which Pilgrim 
alleged had libeled it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim sued Morningstar a year ago, charging that Morningstar had damaged the 
company with a newsletter report that questioned the accuracy of some of 
Pilgrim's fund advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim wanted a trial to prove its point. But in a decision Friday from the 
California Court of Appeal for the second appellate district, the company's 
suit was ordered dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Morningstar, as a publisher, had asserted its First Amendment right to 
question Pilgrim's ads, and the court agreed that Morningstar's analysis was 
"non-actionable." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim, which manages $2.8 billion, has been embroiled in a number of 
controversies over its funds in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The company issued a terse statement Sunday indicating that it will not 
attempt to appeal the court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we are concerned, the matter is now closed, and we shall continue 
to focus our efforts on delivering top performance to our shareholders," 
Pilgrim said. Measuring Bond Viability 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all bonds and bond mutual funds decline in price when interest rates 
rise, just as they appreciate when the rates drop. However, the magnitude of 
any fluctuations depends on the type of debt instrument, especially its 
maturity. Here is roughly how much principal loss various bonds and mutual 
funds would see if interest rates rose by one percentage point.

IBM, OTHER U.S. GIANTS SLASH OFFICE SPACE; ECONOMY: IN THE PAST THREE YEARS, 
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES HAS VACATED NEARLY HALF ITS U.S. OFFICE SPACE 
-- 21 MILLION SQUARE FEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lee Dayton was anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 It was early 1993, and IBM was bleeding red ink. Dayton, IBM's manager of real 
estate, ordered his staff to slash expenses for office space. They quickly 
responded, moving four employees into one wastefully big office. 
</P>
<P>
 His. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my team that we'd better make an example of ourselves," the manager 
recalled, grinning. "They came up with a plan which required me to evict 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton's transfer to a smaller office in Stamford, Conn., was symptomatic of a 
change that is reshaping IBM and other parts of corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, International Business Machines Corp. has vacated 
nearly half its U.S. office space -- 21 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrinkage reflects IBM's sharp decline in the highly competitive, 
DOS-eat-DOS era of personal computers. IBM has shed a third of its U.S. 
employees in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer maker is not alone. Companies that have downsized their staffs 
are looking to do the same to their office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Dayton's group, in addition to pruning IBM's space, has done 
consulting work to help American Express Co. and KPMG Peat Marwick reduce 
office space. A number of corporate giants, from AT&T to Aetna, have embarked 
on space-reduction programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent Arthur Andersen & Co. survey, nearly two-thirds of 700 corporate 
executives said they had recently shrunk their office space, or planned to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last three years, they (companies) have been shedding workers like 
crazy. That has caused them to reassess how much space they need," said William 
Wheaton, director of the center for real estate studies at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Some firms have gone so far as to "re-engineer the work space so they need 
less space per worker," Wheaton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say a further decline for commercial real estate in the United States 
is unlikely, since smaller, growing businesses are moving into the empty space. 
</P>
<P>
 But some cities have been hit badly. In White Plains, 25 miles north of New 
York City, IBM has vacated five buildings. A thriving corporate center in the 
mid-1980s, it's now dotted with glass-and-concrete shells. More than 25% of its 
office space is empty, one of the highest rates in the nation, said ONCOR 
International, a real-estate services firm. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM's case is striking because of the amount of space it is cutting and its 
attempt to do more than simply dispose of unused offices. It's trying to 
squeeze every penny out of its real estate, in what Dayton calls "a fundamental 
change in thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to very matter-of-factly explain that having a private office or a 
given office size is not an entitlement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At IBM, rank used to have its privileges. Ask Linda Bodden. In the old days, 
the 34-year-old branch manager would have had a personal branch manager's 
secretary and a branch manager's desk, which was bigger than a marketing 
manager's desk." 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a branch manager in the old days was to get the big corner office," she 
said. "That was a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Bodden works out of clients' offices, assisted by a car phone, 
beeper and a laptop computer. When she checks into the Cranford, N.J., IBM 
office every two weeks, she shares a small cubicle in an open space. It was, 
she said, a "cultural change." 
</P>
<P>
 Five thousand of IBM's 125,000 U.S. employees have similarly been forced to 
become mobile in the past few years, and IBM plans to double that number. Many 
share secretaries and take turns using a sort of communal desk.

O.C. ENTERPRISE / JAMES S. GRANELLI: TROY PRINTER HELPS KEEP BUSINESSES IN 
CHECKS; THE SANTA ANA COMPANY'S NEW DEAL TO MODIFY HEWLETT-PACKARD LASERJETS TO 
MAKE CHECKS FROM BLANK PAPER COULD MEAN EXPLOSIVE GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For computer buffs, printing their own checks means buying blanks from their 
banks with the account numbers and other codes already printed in special 
magnetic ink along the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 But for corporations like Farmers Insurance Co., there's the desktop Troy 
printer. The specially souped-up unit allows agents in any field office to use 
a blank piece of paper to print everything from the logo to the signature -- 
including that magnetic strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a Troy printer saves time and money, and it makes managing cash on a 
daily basis a breeze, said Sherry Koerner, Farmers' accounting systems 
programming manager. "We know right up to the day what's been issued and what's 
outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy, a division of privately held Pierce Cos. in Santa Ana, has been quietly 
growing since it first introduced the desktop check printer in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is poised for "explosive" growth, said its president, Robert A. 
Blanchet. The company recently signed an exclusive contract with 
Hewlett-Packard Co. to modify HP LaserJet 4 printers and sell them as dual 
purpose Troy printers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The LaserJet has become the industry standard," Blanchet said. "The HP 
produces the finest printing available." 
</P>
<P>
 With falling prices -- Troy's original desktop printer cost $15,000 nine years 
ago -- Blanchet expects that the newest line at $3,200 a unit will nearly 
double the $20 million in revenue that the company had last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy will continue to offer IBM printers, but the HP units are expected to be 
the big sellers, not only because of their price and popularity but also 
because the Hewlett-Packard sales force will be recommending the printer to 
customers who want to make their own checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy was founded in 1963 as an industrial engraving company that made print 
cylinders, or drums, for printers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, it began making large, high-speed MICR printers to produce checks. 
MICR stands for magnetic ink character recognition; the numbers and codes at 
the bottom of checks have to be printed in MICR ink so that scanners at 
check-clearing centers can read checks quickly, crediting and debiting accounts 
instantaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Those high-speed MICR units, starting at $65,000, were for major customers, 
including the U.S. Treasury Department. Blanchet said Troy controls 60% of the 
U.S. market and 55% of the world market for check printers. Xerox Corp., its 
nearest competitor, has less than 20% of either market, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy came up with the desktop model for companies that don't need the speed 
but could use the versatility and savings that Troy printers and software 
offered. It eased both accounting and security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In an insurance company like Farmers, which uses about 225 Troy printers 
nationwide, the printer and the software give employees the ability to issue 
checks immediately at the local level while recording the transaction 
simultaneously at Farmers headquarters, Koerner said. 
</P>
<P>
 That gives executives in the home office the ability to manage cash needs 
easily. Previously, Farmers would have to wait for field offices to send in 
reports on expenditures, so the insurer had to keep extra cash in the bank to 
cover possibly unaccounted payments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company saves money on checks. By using blank check stock, 
Koerner said, Farmers doesn't waste paper every time it closes an account. The 
software allows the computer operator simply to key in the new account 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think before, we were typing up checks on a typewriter and mailing them 
out," Koerner said. "Now the printer does everything. We like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Progressive Corp., a Cleveland insurance company, uses more than 200 Troy 
printers in 164 offices nationwide. Executives there figured that even though 
automating the operation from scratch cost millions of dollars, they expected 
to recoup costs in less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchet said Troy printers also save money for firms like property management 
companies that have multiple accounts or often change accounts. By simply 
changing the MICR line through the computer, those companies can print checks 
quickly from numerous accounts and never change the paper. And because there 
are no blank checks from banks, there is no wasted paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest problem," Blanchet said, "is that people don't know the benefits 
of printing their own checks. It's become like letterhead. With technology, you 
don't need to buy letterhead anymore. You produce it each time you need it."

 Analyst review: "Rainbow technologies is currently the leader in software 
protection, with a 50% market share. It recently developed a new application, 
The VendorSystem, to allow its customers to distribute multiple products on a 
single compact disc and other media while remotely controlling access to data. 
The company has managed to grow in excess of 30% based on its original product. 
With its new application, it should be able to further expand its potential 
revenue base. Also, approximately 90% of Rainbow's revenues are derived from 
reorders, enhancing its revenue stability. Because the company continues to 
strengthen its presence in the software protection market, we recommend initial 
purchases for growth-oriented investors."

 Thumbs up: "I like making sure everyone who comes here has a good time. We 
have five satellite dishes, and I always try my best to find the sporting event 
that customers want to see. We have 45 color monitors, so if a party of five 
wants to watch a South American soccer match while another group is watching 
Canadian hockey games or a playoff, I can set that up and keep everyone happy. 
I also like putting on a show with all of the video and sound equipment that 
produces special effects and computerized graphics." 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs down: "It almost always seems like there's never enough time to do 
everything I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Next step: "I really like the restaurant business, and I would like to become 
more involved in management and marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 Advice: "I was allowed to grow into this job and make it what it is. It really 
helps to have a good manager to teach you things and help you see beyond your 
present job to what your career could develop into. Our first general manager, 
Dan Daugherty, showed me how to relate to customers and taught me about 
marketing. Our new manager, Robert Sylvia, showed me how to work as a team with 
other employees, and I am learning from him some of the things it takes to be 
in management. But to do this job, you really have to like getting the crowd 
going and playing host." 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: "I work five days a week. My actual hours vary according to sporting 
event schedules. Usually my hours are 2 to 10 p.m., and I work lots of 
weekends." 
</P>
<P>
 Job description: "I coordinate all the sporting event broadcasts at the 
restaurant, making sure everything is operating correctly and that customers 
get to watch what they came to see. I play host and get the crowd going, 
especially during playoffs. I tape a lot of live events for future broadcasts 
and maintain our tape library. I am also involved in marketing for our happy 
hour parties, which I also host."  
</P>
<P>
 Educational and training requirements: "I don't think there is a set career 
path for this job. But I have some college background, which helps, and so does 
my previous experience in public relations, radio and several years spent 
working as a deejay. I also used to work at Disneyland marching as a character 
in the parades, and this taught me how to approach people and help them have a 
good time. I taught sixth grade for a while, and this taught me to be patient 
with the crowds of excited people we have here. It also helps to have a 
technical background to help you work all the equipment."

 April 1 is the annual deadline for savers and investors who reached the age of 
70 1/2 in the previous calendar year to start taking distributions from their 
individual retirement accounts, Keogh plans, and employer-sponsored 401(k) 
plans, if they haven't already done so. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules specify that they must take a minimum distribution calculated by a 
formula using Internal Revenue Service tables of life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, they face a penalty tax that runs to 50% of whatever amount should 
have been withdrawn but wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to ensure that accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s are used as bona 
fide retirement savings vehicles, rather than just mechanisms for deferring tax 
indefinitely. The requirement is the same whether you have actually retired or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs like IRAs, Keoghs and 401(k)s allow savers to take a tax deduction 
for their contributions each year, and to accumulate earnings in the account 
through dividends, interest and capital gains without having to pay taxes until 
withdrawals begin. 
</P>
<P>
 You can start taking money out of these accounts at age 59 1/2 without penalty 
if you want or need to do so. But you also have the option of leaving the money 
untouched until as late as age 70 1/2, which gives your money a lot more time 
to grow without being taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 At that stage, however, you must begin withdrawals each year based on the 
total in your account divided by your statistical life expectancy in years, or 
the life expectancy of the last survivor between you and a beneficiary you have 
designated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, people who don't want to take any distributions until the last moment 
should still start planning for them as early as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules for determining minimum required distributions are complicated," 
points out the J.K. Lasser Institute in its "Your Income Tax 1993" guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contact your plan administrator well in advance to determine your options in 
selecting beneficiaries and figuring a payout schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a first distribution by April 1, a person who reached age 70 1/2 
in 1993 will have to take succeeding annual distributions by the end of each 
calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that a second distribution will need to occur this year. If the 
amounts involved are of any significant size, this can cause problems in other 
areas of your income taxes, such as estimated quarterly payments that may have 
to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 So the year when distributions from a retirement plan begin often turns out to 
be a time for extra work, and possibly extra consultations with a tax adviser, 
beyond the normal tax planning efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a further wrinkle in the procedure to help guard against the risk of 
exhausting the money in a retirement account prematurely, in the event that a 
saver lives longer than his or her statistical life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless the IRA or trustee provides otherwise, the life expectancies of the 
owner and spouse are redetermined each year," notes H&R Block in its current 
"Income Tax Guide." Thus, the amount of each succeeding minimum distribution is 
likely to vary. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you can always take more than the minimum whenever you wish. But 
the more you can leave in the account, the more it can continue to earn 
tax-deferred for as long as the rules will allow.

MARKET TIMERS ARE BOUND TO FAIL TRYING TO PREDICT BROAD SWINGS; INVESTING: 
RECENT TURMOIL HAS SOME FUND SHAREHOLDERS WONDERING IF THE LONG-AWAITED BEAR 
MARKET HAS ARRIVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLINT WILLIS, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent turmoil in the stock market has some fund shareholders wondering if 
the long-awaited bear market has finally arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Many will try to outmaneuver the markets by shifting assets out of stock funds 
and into money market funds or bank accounts. They might succeed in dodging the 
bullet this time, but any strategy that depends upon an investor's ability to 
outguess the stock market is bound to fail in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence is overwhelming that market timing -- shifting money between 
stocks and other assets in an attempt to ride bull markets and avoid bear 
market losses -- simply doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the records of funds that pursue a timing strategy. Henry Van der Eb, 
manager of the Mathers Fund (800-962-3863), became bearish on the market in 
early 1989, and moved to a largely cash position. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the fund has delivered an annualized average return of only 5.84% 
over the past five years -- compared with 13.70% for the S&P 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you ask investors who have been successful over time, they'll tell you 
that their record has nothing to do with market timing," says Roger Gibson, a 
Pittsburgh money manager and author of Asset Allocation (Irwin Professional 
Publishing, $45). 
</P>
<P>
 Such anecdotal evidence has been strongly supported by academic and other 
formal studies over the years. Those studies generally conclude that the odds 
are heavily against a market timing strategy; over the long run, you are more 
likely to make money by sticking with your stock holdings through thick and 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because over periods of three to five years or longer, stocks are 
wonderful investments -- far better than cash or anything else you can buy 
through a mutual fund. Thus, whenever you take money out of stocks you are 
probably going to pay a penalty in the form of lower long-term returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are times when it pays to be out of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But such times are more infrequent than most investors realize. Gibson cites a 
1987 study by Trinity Investment Management, which reviewed bull and bear 
markets over a 40-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 The results included these findings: 1) Bull markets lasted nearly three times 
as long as bear markets -- 41 months versus 14 months. 2) The typical bull 
market delivers a 105% gain, versus a 28% drop in the typical bear market. 3) 
Even during bear markets, stocks go up during three to four out of every 10 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trinity study is almost seven years old, but its conclusions would be even 
stronger today, as stocks have advanced steadily during most of the intervening 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 To succeed as a market timer, you must not only miss bear markets, you must 
also be sure and get back into the stock market in time for the next sustained 
rise in share prices. But those rebounds often occur after sharp declines in 
stock prices -- the very times when most timers are still scrambling to get out 
of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Also consider taxes and transaction costs. A study by Mark Hulbert, editor of 
the Hulbert Financial Digest, looked at pre- and after-tax returns of the 
recommended strategies of 29 market-timing newsletters and compared them with 
the returns of an index fund that invested in the S&P 500. 
</P>
<P>
 On a pretax basis only four of the letters beat the index fund over five 
years. After taxes were considered, only one newsletter edged out a 
buy-and-hold strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 So what should you do if you're worried? Make sure your savings include three 
to six months of living expenses in cash investments so you can cope with 
unexpected expenses or a financial setback such as a job loss. Also consider 
shifting some money from more aggressive funds to conservative growth funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crabbe Huson Equity Fund (800-541-9732), for example, has been only 41% as 
risky as the average equity fund over the past three years, but has delivered 
24.2% annual returns over the period. The fund's management team uses a 
contrarian approach, choosing battered stocks whose shares aren't likely to 
decline as steeply as the typical stock in a bear market. The fund has no 
initial sales charge and a $1,000 minimum initial investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Another conservative choice is T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation 
(800-638-5660; no load; $2,500 minimum investment). The fund has been only 27% 
as volatile as the typical growth fund during the past three years, but has 
delivered 14.7% annual returns, comparable to the S&P 500's 15.3% annualized 
gain.

STUDY FINDS FEW LATINOS IN CORPORATE SUITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latinos, one of the most affluent ethnic groups in the country, held director 
positions last year on just 94 of the Fortune 1,000 companies, said a study 
released recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the Hispanic Assn. on Corporate Responsibility, a 
Washington-based watchdog group, also said Latinos held no corporate director 
positions within entire industries such as aerospace, pharmaceuticals and 
toys-sporting goods. 
</P>
<P>
 That translates to 105 seats occupied by Latinos out of 11,248 available seats 
in the 50 states. Because some people are directors in more than one company, 
the net result is that 72 Latinos occupied the seats. By contrast, in 1992, 58 
Latinos occupied 84 board seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that Hispanics are represented on 9% of America's Fortune 
company boards," Richard Jose Bela, president of the corporate responsibility 
association, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad news is more devastating. Although we make up a substantial part of 
the market, we are not represented on over 90% of America's corporate boards 
and, in those board rooms where we are included, our representation is often 
tantamount to tokenism." 
</P>
<P>
 When calculated by the number of director seats, Latinos comprise less than 1% 
of Fortune 1,000 boards, far below their 9% representation in the general 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino group, a consortium of seven national Latino organizations, urged 
corporations to increase Latino representation on their boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other industries that have no Latinos on their boards are furniture, 
jewelry-silverware, mining, crude oil production, rubber and plastics products, 
tobacco and transportation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry with the highest Latino representation is the building materials 
industry, followed by beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino group said that among the Fortune 500 there are but 35 Latino 
executive officers out of 6,179, or 0.57%. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos are among the most prosperous ethnic groups. The March issue of 
Hispanic Business magazine reports there are 60 Latino individuals or families 
worth at least $25 million. By contrast, last year there were 50 Latino 
individuals or families worth at least $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten on this year's list made their fortunes in the category of supermarkets, 
restaurants and food-related, and another 10 were in media and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most affluent are Roberto C. Goizueta, chief executive officer of 
Coca-Cola, worth $300 million; singer Gloria Estefan and her producer husband, 
Emilio, worth $40 million, and television personality Geraldo Rivera, worth $25 
million.

BONDS AND FUNDS THAT BUY THEM HEAD SOUTH AS INTEREST RATES CLIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA STERN, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mutual funds that invest in bonds have had a nice run. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of low inflation and falling interest rates have well rewarded those 
investors who abandoned money market funds and bank certificates for the more 
promising yields of the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond fund returns grew on the strength of solid yields and rising demand for 
instruments paying anything more than the paltry 3% or 4% the banks had been 
promising. 
</P>
<P>
 But that trend has reversed. Bonds and the funds that buy them have headed 
south and might keep going that way if interest rates are set for the prolonged 
rise that some prognosticators see. 
</P>
<P>
 When interest rates rise, the prices of bonds fall as new, higher yielding 
bonds hit the street and compete with the lower yielding bonds already out 
there. For some investors, this means timing the market -- pulling out of bonds 
altogether when they expect rates to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 But most bond fund investors prefer a less drastic alternative. Wary of 
betting everything on uncertain interest rate predictions and determined to 
keep at least some of their portfolio in the bond market, they are looking for 
ways to stay in bonds without losing their shirts in a rising rate environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The choices are somewhat limited," says John Markese, president of the 
American Assn. of Individual Investors in Chicago. "Primarily, you can look 
down the maturity scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Because longer-term bonds are most responsive to interest rate fluctuations, 
the shorter the average maturity of the bond portfolio, the less volatile the 
fund is likely to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Markese suggests that investors wary of rate hikes move to 
intermediate-maturity portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you stay in the five- to seven-year range, you'll maximize return and 
reduce the risk you would be taking for going the extra way out on the maturity 
spectrum," says Markese. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that move to shorter maturities may be less easy than it sounds. Steve 
Schoepke, senior analyst with Moody's Investor Service, New York, points out 
that one can't always tell by a fund's name exactly how long- or short-term its 
portfolio is. 
</P>
<P>
 You can check in Morningstar's mutual fund guides, available at many public 
libraries, for the average portfolio maturity of a bond fund. 
</P>
<P>
 A second step to protecting a bond fund portfolio involves skirting the funds 
that are the most interest-rate sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, these are funds that buy long-term zero-coupon bonds -- instruments 
that gather no quarterly or semi-annual interest but pay off in a lump sum when 
the bond matures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the most volatile," says Markese. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, there are bond funds on the market that leverage their interest 
rate sensitivity by including derivative products -- artificial financial 
instruments that are created from pieces of other bonds and may reflect 
underlying or unrelated indexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly these leveraged products will move a multiple of the interest rate 
movement," notes Gary Arne, a director in the managed funds group at Standard & 
Poor's, New York, a investment rating firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Arne also recommends that investors steer clear of bond markets that are said 
to be illiquid, although he concedes this measure can change rapidly over days 
or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A temporary uncertainty in the municipal bond market, for example, can put a 
gap between the bid and asked price throughout the whole market that may not be 
warranted by interest rate increases or other fundamental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, bond fund investors would do well to pick the funds that seem less 
volatile over long periods, though finding them is a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's recently began issuing volatility rankings on bond funds it 
studies.

CULTURE WATCH; TWO TYPES OF TOYS: 'GROSS' AND 'PINK'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Toy manufacturers insist that they're not promoting stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 But for children beyond preschool age, toys seem to be divided into two 
categories: gross and pink. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done research," says Lisa McKendall, Mattel Toys' manager of marketing 
communications. "Boys love yucky, disgusting and scary. Girls love pretty and 
pink." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids may love this stuff -- or not: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dress & Dream Dress-Up Vanity -- Fisher-Price describes its three-panel 
vanity with makeup counter and stool as "an all-in-one play center combining 
vanity play and fantasy dress-up." $86. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Dreadful Food Lab -- Great for creating monster brains on a stick and 
other wiggly, jiggly creatures. Tyco makes a companion Drink Lab to concoct 
seriously putrid potions and foaming drinks. $25.

LIGHTS OUT AT THE BEST PARTY IN TOWN; SWIFTY LAZAR'S PALS RECALL THE MAN AND 
THE EVENT THAT BECAME AN OSCAR TRADITION 
</P>

 It was the party of the year on the night of the year, and if you could sell 
your mother for a chance to get in, you just might have done it. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar's Oscar night bash was the triple-A-list 
party, an E-ticket ride to the biggest celeb-fest ever. Although the Governor's 
Ball is the official post-Academy Awards soiree, it wasn't unusual for a 
presenter, nominee or winner to ditch it altogether and limo to Lazar's. 
</P>
<P>
 To be invited meant that you were a friend, or that you'd finally arrived. If 
you weren't asked, you had the options of leaving town or suffering the 
indignity of begging for an invitation. Or, you could do as one crasher did and 
try to wedge your fanny through a second-story window. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths of the legendary powerhouse last December and of his wife, Mary, 11 
months earlier, put an end to a tradition that spanned three decades, beginning 
as an intimate dinner for friends at the Bistro in Beverly Hills and evolving 
into a media frenzy at Spago. 
</P>
<P>
 Those close to Lazar -- the ones who called him Irving, as he preferred -- 
can't quite believe that their friend is gone, that tonight Spago will be dark, 
that there will be no glamorous celebration capped with pizza and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Caine and wife Shakira are deliberately out of town: "We don't feel 
like celebrating anything," Caine said from England. 
</P>
<P>
 Angie Dickinson will be watching the show at a friend's house. Some, including 
Barbara and Marvin Davis, will attend other parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one will forget the diminutive, bald man in oversized black-rimmed 
glasses who would admonish guests to sit down, eat dinner and watch the show on 
the various monitors around the room. Lazar didn't suffer table hoppers gladly. 
If you were seated for dinner, you sat . 
</P>
<P>
 And no one will forget Mary, described by one friend as looking like a cameo, 
as much responsible for the success of the party as her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening unfolded in stages, the first before sundown when guests would 
assemble for dinner. A second wave of guests came later from the awards show 
Downtown. Here the party found its second wind, re-energized by fresh blood and 
new faces, some gripping heavy gold statuettes and stargazing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 So many movie stars, directors, producers, studio chiefs, writers and media 
types were crammed into one place that even the most jaded Hollywood-ites were 
impressed with the view. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Lazaroff, restaurant designer and wife of Spago's Wolfgang Puck, 
recalls this scenario: "We'd do all the prep work; Wolf would be cooking all 
day. Then Mary would show up with the boards for the seating. Then Irving would 
come in, look at the boards that she'd been preparing for weeks and move people 
around. Then he'd leave and she'd move them all back. Then she'd leave. It was 
the same scene every year, but we loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something funny would always happen at the party," she says. "The year 
Madonna and Michael Jackson came together, they almost seemed like an old 
married couple. . . . And you could always measure popularity by how loudly 
people standing outside screamed. When Oprah Winfrey came walking down, you'd 
think the Messiah had arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Jacqueline Bissett calls Lazar's annual fete "an evening of excitement 
and a bit of fear." 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls "one ironic situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at a table with a lot of bigwigs, and I remember Meryl Streep was up 
for 'Ironweed,' but a lot of people at my table hadn't seen it. I thought in 
this performance she was just brilliant. And suddenly I got the sense of the 
split between the work and the social tornado -- that people in this town who 
are in the social tornado don't know the work. It was very odd. . . . There was 
a definite imbalance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was Lazar's ability to draw in all kinds of fascinating people that 
Dickinson admires. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year I remember I was seated across from Paloma Picasso, and that was 
thrilling. Another year I was seated near (Rolling Stone Publisher) Jann 
Wenner. It was also the kind of party where if you hadn't met someone, you 
could. I had never met Kathleen Turner, and I felt very comfortable going to up 
to her and introducing myself." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lazar moved his base of operations to Spago in 1985, the hype grew 
exponentially. The party extended beyond Spago's front door and could be 
diagrammed in concentric circles: On the outermost arc were fans behind 
barricades near the restaurant. A gaggle of paparazzi staked out the sidewalk. 
Security types scattered around the restaurant watched crashers and ushered in 
the biggest stars through the back entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 A few select reporters, photographers and camera crews were stationed on the 
front porch to catch sound bites. A handful of lucky media types were allowed 
inside, some told not to roam beyond the bar during dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Seating was tricky -- few relished being stuck in the back room, although 
mega-celebs sometimes were stuck there anyway. The front room was considered 
ground zero, the primo spot for watching and being watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who messed with Lazar-approved arrangements were playing with a sizable 
ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you asked to be seated with somebody, he made sure not only that you 
weren't, but that you ended up in Siberia," says producer and director Lili 
Fini Zanuck, who attended her first Lazar Oscar night party 15 years ago and 
recalls the parties, and Lazar, with great fondness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was enjoying his Holy Roman Emperor status with that, and those people 
were punished." 
</P>
<P>
 She recalls the year she and husband Richard won the best picture Oscar for 
"Driving Miss Daisy." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had great seats in the front room," she says. "And the next year we were 
moved back to the back room." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Lazar's famous party had its share of glitches and incidents. 
Lazaroff says that despite times when ex-husbands would collide with ex-wives 
and their respective new partners, no major battles ensued. There was one year 
when an accidental flip of a switch changed the Oscar broadcast to a home 
shopping channel, but it was changed back before anyone had time to purchase a 
cubic zirconium. 
</P>
<P>
 One year guests watched with amusement as Jack Nicholson walked in, stayed for 
a few minutes and left with a centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Caine recalls the year he was nominated for best actor for "Educating 
Rita" but lost to Robert Duvall in "Tender Mercies." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked in, I got the same cheers as if I had won," he says. "They all 
said, 'It's the same to us, Michael.' I didn't win, but to get an ovation like 
that from people like Cary Grant was an incredible thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Swifty was amazing," says actor Roger Moore, one in the stable of regulars. 
"The old saying says it best -- it was the best of times and the best of 
friends. And you know, egos being what they are, everybody wants to sit where 
they think is the important place, but the Lazars were able to make everybody 
feel like they were important. We'll all be thinking of them on Oscar night." 
</P>
<P>
 Philanthropist Barbara Davis remembers the night as "everything you wished New 
Year's Eve would be when you were a child. It was like Bastille Day and the 
Fourth of July. I'd think about going to that party for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the dinner he was very firm -- he didn't want people moving around. He 
wouldn't use the early part of the evening as a social time. He respected the 
industry and the industry respected him." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlee Matlin was all of 21 and a babe in Hollywood when she went to Spago 
after winning her Academy Award as best actress for "Children of a Lesser God." 
</P>
<P>
 "I arrived in shock," she recalls. "I walked in and saw all these stars and I 
thought I was in the Twilight Zone. I saw Liz Taylor and I went chasing after 
her because I had to meet her. Also, sitting near us was another personality 
who was so drunk he fell off his chair. We didn't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Oscar night regular and Lazar pal was Don Rickles, who says: "If you 
were a friend, he really showed it at the party. He was a gracious host. Even 
though there were great big major stars there, your position in life wasn't 
what always mattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their friendship, Rickles adds, "I was more in awe of him. He was like 
a general. He was the star. Every major person made it a point to say hello." 
</P>
<P>
 But being a major person didn't mean Swifty always let you have your way. 
</P>
<P>
 One year, Lazar's associate, Alan Nevins, was pulling guest-list duty at the 
door where he was seen arguing with an officious-looking young woman from Gov. 
Pete Wilson's office over his refusal to allow the governor's bodyguards 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bu-bu-but he's the governor," the woman kept repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know who he is," Nevins replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will you personally guarantee his safety?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about his safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the governor was spotted at the party, with no bodyguards in sight. 
Madonna, however, had a huge one by her side.

THE FINAL EDITION FOR SCHOOL PAPERS?; EDUCATION: NO ONE'S WRITING AN OBITUARY 
FOR THE PUBLICATIONS YET. BUT ADVISERS SAY THE QUEST FOR RESOURCES IS STARTING 
TO OVERWHELM THEM.

 The presses at Crenshaw High School are up and running again, but nobody can 
say for how long. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past five years, students have produced the Cry of the Cougar off and 
on -- sometimes monthly, sometimes quarterly, always eagerly. But the paper's 
fortunes are perpetually tied to funding and the availability of an adviser to 
oversee publication, a responsibility many teachers are loath to take on. No 
adviser, no paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that the district doesn't compensate journalism teachers well 
enough," said Robin Hernandez, Crenshaw's most recent journalism adviser. "The 
headaches outweigh the compensation. If (a high school) has a good paper, it's 
because of a teacher. Somebody is trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Hernandez in the publisher's chair, the paper has had problems. A 
dozen students share just one computer. Few businesses have been interested in 
sponsorship or advertising, so there is never enough money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a shame that a big high school like this can't manage to get out 
a lousy school paper every month," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's story is similar to those at high schools throughout California, 
where newspapers are dying off as school budgets have shrunk and priorities are 
focused on basic educational needs, said Mike Jordan, a journalism professor at 
Pepperdine University. To make matters worse, most newspapers are left out when 
companies eager to fund futuristic television and multimedia labs make large 
grants to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 School newspapers nationwide are suffering from the same problems, according 
to a recent study published by the Freedom Forum, a media think tank based in 
Arlington, Va. The study concluded that editorial and financial restrictions on 
high school newspapers nationwide are worse now than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, who has been polling California schools, said between 15% and 20% of 
the state's student-run publications may have perished in the past five years, 
although, he added, final numbers are not in.  
</P>
<P>
 School newspapers have declined to such a degree that Windgate Publishing, 
which publishes L.A. Parent magazine, began printing a journal aimed 
exclusively at teen-agers four years ago. Noise, as it is called, is written by 
a paid staff of teen-age correspondents and distributed throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide what high school newspapers used to provide -- a training ground 
for future journalists," Editor Norbert Sparrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, nearly all of the 49 standard high 
schools publish a student newspaper of some sort. But many come out only 
sporadically and almost all report problems with funding. Furthermore, most 
programs are completely dependent on the work of a single journalism adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Part editor and part teacher, advisers traditionally concentrated on 
journalistic basics. But as support for student newspapers has eroded, many say 
their part-time advisory duties have become full-time quests for resources to 
keep the papers alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Rittger, who heads the program at Narbonne High School in Harbor City, 
said she has spent her own money to buy computer equipment. Josephine Zarro of 
Manual Arts High School tried to run the presses herself. And Westchester High 
School's Cyril Baird speaks of a never-ending quest for money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The struggle gets worse every year," Baird said. "We find ourselves having to 
sell chocolate and wash cars." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this comes in addition to normal teaching loads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even five years ago, every school had (a paper)," said Jordan, who is 
conducting the poll for the Southern California Journalism Educators Assn. 
"They were healthy. They had experienced advisers and budgets. They were 
well-organized and printed frequently. What has happened in the last five years 
is disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Journalism advisers are retiring or moving on and the papers aren't 
sustaining themselves. Publication is going from 10 times a year to two or 
three." 
</P>
<P>
 Although journalism classes in the Los Angeles district are electives and not 
a graduation requirement, they are accepted for credit by University of 
California schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes are not well funded because they don't draw large numbers of 
students, said Dick Browning, director of the district's Senior High School 
Division. Because most school newspapers lose money and because electives in 
general are underfunded, Browning said publication may indeed be getting more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "The death of high school journalism is exaggerated," he said. "I don't 
think it's happening yet. But there are problems that budgets play into. I 
don't know if journalism has declined . . . but it's been a problem over the 
last 15 years. It hasn't been well funded and it's getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. O'Sullivan, principal at Fairfax High School, referred to the death 
of his school's paper three years ago as "a casualty of shrinking enrollment" 
in journalism classes. 
</P>
<P>
 But many teachers said interest would increase if they could put out a better 
product. Jordan agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not because students don't want to do it," Jordan said. "Students love 
this type of hands-on, collaborative learning. When you don't have a program 
and there's no good adviser and no commitment, it's easy to say there's no 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of 19 high school newspapers that stopped publishing in the past 
decade, the Freedom Forum study found that 52% suffered from lack of funds and 
42% cited a lack of interested faculty. But only 26% cited a lack of student 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green & Gold, published weekly at Narbonne High, has won numerous awards. 
In 1992, it was ranked among the top five nationwide by the Columbia Scholastic 
Press Assn., Rittger said. The adviser since 1982, Rittger said the paper has 
become an important part of life at Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're showing our kids their environment through language -- nothing else 
does that," she said. "It's one of the ways a school has of maintaining its 
identity. There are always kids without voices. That's who we write for. I 
would have left teaching long ago if it wasn't for the journalism classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 But the adviser, 55, said she is tired of the fight and of the quest for funds 
and administrative support. She has decided to leave next year, but worries 
that her successor will not be able to maintain the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hill keeps getting steeper," she said. "You can only be as successful as 
the school permits you to be . . . and you are not loved for it. I hope they 
hire someone I can train. I want them to bring somebody in so the program 
doesn't die. I don't know that they will." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zarro pointed out that her paper at Manual Arts has a long history, having 
published both weekly and daily in the past. Still, the print shop where the 
paper was run off lost its funding two years ago. Hoping to keep the operation 
running, she tried to run the presses herself but was stopped by administrators 
worried about safety. As a last resort, Zarro and her class began putting out a 
newsletter-style paper once a month, enlisting another school to print it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking it in increments," she said. "This year, the shop teacher is in 
the process of building up the (printing) lab again." 
</P>
<P>
 Zarro said the paper's fate rests on her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a labor of love," she said. "If I leave, there may be no paper. I don't 
want it to just go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said that a trained, well-paid adviser can make all the difference in 
running a program. "It has to be an administrative budgetary commitment," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplemental pay scale for journalism advisers in the Los Angeles district 
varies according to the size of the program, editions published and activities 
conducted, officials said. Teachers who take on journalism classes can earn an 
additional $1,288 to $2,780 per year, said Tom Killeen, administrator of 
personnel services. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplemental pay is competitive with what a band leader or coach might 
make, said Miriam Gonzales, coordinator for personnel research. This is on top 
of an average teacher salary of $40,981, according to figures for the 1992-93 
school year.  
</P>
<P>
 But for many, it's not enough, given the difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to get students to write well. It's a big headache and nobody 
wants to help do it. Then you go to the trouble and somebody has something 
negative to say about the content," said Crenshaw's Hernandez.  
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching is a thankless job and you get worn out. When you work with a 
bureaucracy, you are underpaid, overworked and stressed out, anyone can have a 
problem maintaining a positive attitude."

STUDENTS CHANNEL INTERESTS INTO TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The television studios at Beverly Hills High School rarely sit idle. 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 years, students have produced programming telecast on local cable 
channels. Newscasts, music reviews, health shows and educational programming 
are all part of the package offered five days a week to the 35,000 subscribers 
of the Century Cable System. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you are going to see more of this because the equipment is getting 
cheaper and smaller and there is more access to it," said Dave Stiles, director 
of media services at Beverly Hills High. "We almost started too early. When we 
started, we had Ed Sullivan-type, 60-pound cameras." 
</P>
<P>
 Few school TV labs have the long history of funding and school support that 
KBEV has enjoyed. But similar facilities are cropping up in high schools 
throughout Southern California, even as school newspapers publish less 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades High School will soon produce a TV version of the school newspaper 
Tideline and has plans for a closed-circuit radio broadcast by the summer. 
Students at Van Nuys High School produce two news shows a week for a class and 
hope to begin telecasting campuswide soon via closed circuit. And Hamilton High 
School in West Los Angeles will open a $350,000 multimedia communications 
center in the fall, in which students will produce a documentary to be shown on 
local cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Although nobody expects student television to eclipse campus newspapers 
altogether, some teachers say students find it more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids don't read that much, but they do watch TV," said Van Nuys teacher Lonny 
Scharf. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Bruns, director of the media center at Palisades High, said TV has added a 
new component to a journalism program that was already thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the way kids get their news," she said. "It's the way more and more of 
the population gets its news, and I don't think that's necessarily good. I 
think we need print and broadcast together. We try to present that in what 
we're doing here." 
</P>
<P>
 Most TV lab teachers said they need more money and equipment, describing their 
programs as patchwork efforts that often ride on the backs of a few dedicated 
students and aides. Still more rely solely on the expertise of one teacher or 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 But they add that these facilities allow students to receive a great deal of 
training while trying to keep their viewers entertained, if not informed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public access (channels) exposed us to the largest number of people," Bruns 
said. "We didn't promote it at all. So we were surprised at how many viewers 
found it themselves. We feel it's the best avenue. If the programs are good, 
we'll get a regular slot and develop a viewership." GLEN JUSTICE

5.3 AFTERSHOCK RATTLES REGION; EARTHQUAKE: THE TEMBLOR, CENTERED NEAR PANORAMA 
CITY, KNOCKS OUT POWER FOR THOUSANDS OF VALLEY RESIDENTS AND IGNITES TWO FIRES, 
BUT CAUSES LITTLE DAMAGE.

 A powerful aftershock to the Northridge earthquake rolled across Southern 
California on Sunday, igniting two fires, disrupting power to thousands of San 
Fernando Valley residents and sending people fleeing from malls and movie 
theaters, but inflicting little physical damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5.3-magnitude quake, centered near Panorama City, was felt over a wide 
area of Los Angeles and Orange counties when it hit at 1:20 p.m. It was the 
third strongest of more than 6,000 aftershocks that have struck the region 
since the Jan. 17 quake that killed at least 61 people and caused at least $13 
billion in structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh aftershock greater than magnitude 5.0, and it served to 
keep quake-jittery Angelenos on edge for yet another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeways sustained some "cosmetic cracking," but no major damage, a state 
transit official said. 
</P>
<P>
 For fans camped outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for tonight's Oscar 
ceremonies, the shaker gave them a second authentic L. A. experience -- but did 
not move them from their cherished places. Rhea Sprecher, an art teacher from 
Wisconsin, still managed to spot Debbie Allen, Goldie Hawn and others. "I felt 
some rumbling under my feet and I said: 'Would that be an earthquake?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, chandeliers swayed, seats rocked and huge pieces of scenery rattled. 
"Everybody, stay in your seats!" Oscar director Jeff Margolis ordered over the 
public address system. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city Fire Department officials said two fires were started by the 
earthquake. A mini-mall blaze in Van Nuys began because of electrical damage 
caused by the quake, and a transformer at a Department of Water and Power plant 
near Burbank Airport caught fire after earthquake damage caused oil in the unit 
to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire destroyed the Woodley Plaza shopping center in Van Nuys, burning a 
mini-market, video store and a restaurant, said Fire Department spokesman Jim 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 But elsewhere, there was little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, a minor rockslide failed to disrupt traffic. And in Santa Monica, 
life in the bustling Third Street Promenade shopping and dining area was back 
to normal shortly after the temblor stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seismically, this is a very expected behavior. Probably the big news story in 
this earthquake is people's nerves," said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere, hundreds of people were evacuated 
from malls and theaters as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people were removed from IKEA, a home furnishings store in 
Burbank. Despite shoppers' anxiety, the evacuation was quick and orderly, said 
Dennis Rodriguez, the store's operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were a little frightened. We got workers together with customers and 
guided them downstairs," Rodriguez said. Some children were separated from 
parents but were reunited outside the building, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 500 shoppers were evacuated from the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall, 
where the aftershock shattered plate glass alongside an escalator and sent some 
overhead spotlights crashing to the floor. No one was injured at the mall, 
where the first 34 of the complex's 140 stores closed since the Jan. 17 quake 
reopened only Saturday, employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the rain yesterday, and another aftershock today," said Bob Smith, a 
mall employee. "It's been a tough weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also rocked the Glendale Galleria shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shook us pretty hard," said Drew Boghorsyan of the mall's customer 
services department. "We heard the building just rumble. It was really scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Boghorsyan said 26 of the 248 stores in the mall closed after the quake 
because merchants wanted to go home. He said he knew of no damage to the stores 
that closed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sherman Oaks house, moved off its foundation by the Jan. 17 quake and 
scheduled for demolition today, was sent sliding another 30 feet down the 
hillside, imperiling other houses below. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley movie theaters, moviegoers fled their seats as they were showered 
with broken plaster and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some big tiles that fell down," said John Corcoran, who was at the 
Fallbrook Mall theater in Canoga Park. The jolt also shook up construction 
workers still repairing damage from the January temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 James Booth of Burbank was on a bucket lift filling cracks on the second floor 
of the Cal State Northridge science building when the shaking hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was this jackass shaking the bottom of the lift," Booth said, 
pointing to a co-worker. Then, he added, "I thought the entire building was 
going to come down." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge Fashion Center, badly damaged in the January quake, 23 
employees from a wrecking firm also were startled by the aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the center of the mall when it hit," said Al Flores, a supervisor 
for Cleveland Wrecking Co. "It was a lot of bumping up and down. We just got 
all our people together, made sure everyone was all right, and got out of 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer Chris Brock, of Law/Crandall Inc., a firm hired to evaluate the 
damage caused at CSUN by the Northridge quake, said inspectors have found "many 
new cracks, but nothing major yet." 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Monica conference of the Anxiety Disorders Assn. of America ended with 
a bang as the quake struck. "I tell you, the timing couldn't have been better. 
It was the last day, the last minute, the last second and it hit. It was pretty 
ironic," said association President Jerilyn Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 At Disneyland in Anaheim, some of the more elaborate attractions were 
temporarily closed down. At Universal Studios in Universal City, all 
attractions closed immediately after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cangco of Glendale was on a tram going over a bridge that falls apart as 
part of the special effects tour at Universal when the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize it was an earthquake at the time. I thought it was an effect 
of the . . . tram." 
</P>
<P>
 But the shocks seemed too intense to be part of the attraction, he said, and 
the driver didn't say anything. The ride continued, but the King Kong and 
earthquake attractions, scheduled to be included in the tour, were closed. Only 
when the 45-minute ride ended did someone inform the riders that a real 
earthquake had hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock also knocked out power to about 77,000 San Fernando Valley 
residents, most for five minutes or less, Department of Water and Power 
spokeswoman Mindy Berman said. However, about 7,000 customers in Van Nuys were 
without electricity for half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans reported minor damage to freeways near the epicenter of the 
aftershock, but none serious enough to close any roads. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Golden State Freeway north of Granada Hills, the aftershock dislodged 
temporary asphalt filler that had been used to close a 6-to-8-inch gap caused 
by the Northridge quake. Temporary asphalt fixes also came loose in a concrete 
overpass at the interchange of the Simi Valley and San Diego freeways. Caltrans 
crews quickly refilled the gaps without shutting down any of the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that would alarm anyone," said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie 
Tiritilli. "It's super-minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech seismologists said the aftershock was expected and fell within the 
normal range. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is perfectly normal. This is what we expect," said Egill Hauksson, a 
seismologist at Caltech. He said Sunday's shaking occurred on the east side of 
the fault plane where the main shock occurred on Jan. 17, but was not on the 
same fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismic authorities said the aftershock was centered about two miles 
west-northwest of Panorama City, and about three miles northeast of the 
epicenter of the Northridge quake. It fell within a "pie-shaped aftershock 
zone" where shocks have been clustered, Hutton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock was closer to the surface than the Northridge quake, with 
preliminary estimates putting it about nine miles underground, compared to 12 
miles for the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 With a preliminary magnitude of 5.3, the quake is 1/20 the magnitude of the 
Jan. 17 quake. Hutton said the average number of aftershocks continues to 
decline each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's temblor "is an aftershock, but it is also an earthquake on its own" 
and will produce its own aftershocks, she said. However, there is only a 1 in 
20 chance that it was a precursor of a larger quake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two other aftershocks, at magnitudes 5.6 and 5.9, have been stronger than 
Sunday's, and both occurred the day of the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's aftershock was followed by two lesser ones, a 3.4-magnitude 
aftershock recorded at 3:34 p.m., and another reading 2.7 at 8:05 p.m., 
seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a spokesman for Farmers Insurance Co. said Sunday's aftershock 
could trigger a temporary suspension of underwriting earthquake insurance in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geologists may call this an aftershock, but this is a separate quake for 
insurance purposes," said Jeffrey Beyer, spokesman for Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 State law allows insurers to impose a moratorium of up to 60 days on sales of 
earthquake insurance when an quake occurs. A moratorium imposed after the Jan. 
17 Northridge quake covered about 100 square miles and lasted no more than 30 
days at many companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any moratoriums still in effect," Bill Schulz, spokesman for 
the California Department of Insurance, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock prompted Valley business owners and authorities to close some 
public structures so they could check for structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, owners shut down the 75-store Media City Center mall for the day 
after sprinklers jolted by the aftershock drenched some shoppers. City building 
inspectors also ordered the mall parking structure closed until it could be 
inspected, said Lt. Don Brown, of the Burbank Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District said schools will be 
open "as usual" today, although workers will inspect repairs from the January 
quake to make sure they held. In all, 76 public schools were damaged in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, the district's facilities director, said, "We will be out at the 
schools where there was previous damage to make sure the repairs are still 
holding." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to hit the ones that had the most damage and the least permanent 
repair work done and work our way back from there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington, D.C.-based Anxiety Disorders Assn. had been discussing such 
problems as traumatic stress disorders, like those brought on by the Jan. 17 
quake, in its four-day conference at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final seminar drew to a close, the fifth-floor banquet room began to 
shake and the chandeliers rattled noisily. The seminar ended with applause and 
laughter -- for the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the 550-person conference had featured a seminar called "The Los 
Angeles Earthquake and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder." And as their time in 
the city came to a close, some of the psychiatrists and social workers joked 
about earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jokingly, we who'd never experienced an earthquake said, 'Gee, I wish I could 
feel just a little one so I could know what it feels like,' " Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 * FEW REPEATS: Sunday's temblor caused few problems at Valley sites hit hard 
by the Jan. 17 quake. B1

WELCOME TO OSKARCAST 1994: SPIELBERG'S NIGHT AND WHOOPI'S DAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can 1 billion people be wrong? That's how many people are expected to watch as 
Hollywood holds its biggest party for the 66th time.  
</P>
<P>
 And it seems to us that each of those 1 billion has predicted that Steven 
Spielberg will finally take home the Oscar tonight. And that Holly Hunter is a 
shoo-in for best actress. And that Whoopi Goldberg won't be mentioning Ted 
Danson in her monologue. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they'll all watch. Suspense or no, with its astonishing international 
audience, the Academy Awards is a sure draw. 
</P>
<P>
 The elements are in place: Oskar Schindler crying. A colossal train wreck. 
Strong fingers softly caressing piano keys. A butler, a housekeeper and a book. 
Opera and an IV. 
</P>
<P>
 And a new host. Tonight Billy Crystal figuratively hands the baton to Whoopi 
Goldberg, who, one hopes, will do something that will make the stuffed stiffs 
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Finances sweat profusely. Below, a 
scouting report on the once and current hosts.

</P>
<P>
 * Si, oui and more foreign nominee discussion. F4 Billy Crystal 
</P>
<P>
 Host (years served): (1990-93) 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar won-lost record: No awards or nominations, though previous three films 
have received nominations in other categories: "When Harry Met Sally...," 
nominated for best screenplay; "City Slickers," "Mr. Saturday Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Biggest hits: "When Harry Met Sally..." (1989), "City Slickers," (1991). 
</P>
<P>
 Moments they, Oscar and everyone would prefer to forget: Playing the world's 
first pregnant man in the execrable "Rabbit Test" (1978). And the sentimental 
bits of "Memories of Me" (1988) and "Mr. Saturday Night" (1992) -- they might 
bring tears to your eyes, but then, so would electroshock therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Proof that they understand the crass world of Hollywood economics: His next 
film is "City Slickers II," which features Jack Palance playing the twin 
brother of the character that died in the original, a hoary dramatic device 
usually confined to soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside skinny from "The Encyclopedia of Film": Successful, personable and 
multitalented stand-up comic ... a fine mimic and his outrageous caricatures 
have been widely showcased." This, of course, was before "Mr. Saturday Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Missteps involving makeup: Playing an elderly, kvetching Jewish comic under 
mountains of pancake makeup in "Mr. Saturday Night." 
</P>
<P>
 TV: Back when he was a nobody, playing the first openly gay character on 
network TV in "Soap" -- perhaps the most controversial thing he's ever done. 
Also put in an undistinguished year on "Saturday Night Live" (1984-85). 
</P>
<P>
 Hosting strengths: Brilliantly lampooned awards shows with such comic devices 
as the best picture medley; delivery makes scripted gags and ad-libs alike 
sound effortless. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosting weaknesses: He got tired of it fairly quickly -- last year, he seemed 
to have given up the job halfway through the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Ability to fool some of the critics most of the time: Los Angeles magazine's 
movie writer, apparently unaware of the works of Woody Allen or Jacques Tati, 
enthused, " 'Mr. Saturday Night' represents the best job of a comic direction 
himself since Chaplin in 'City lights,' " then admitted he plays poker with 
someone from the film's production company. 
</P>
<P>
 Things that make you say, "Hmm," or at least, "excuse us?": Gil Cates on 
Crystal: "You do it for four years and it gets to be a grind." Excuse us -- 
working one night a year is a "grind"? Whoopi Goldberg 
</P>
<P>
 Host (years served): (1994-?) 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar won-lost record: Nominated for best actress for "The Color Purple" 
(1985, lost to Geraldine Page for "The Trip to Bountiful"); won best supporting 
actress for "Ghost" (1990). 
</P>
<P>
 Biggest hits: "Ghost" (1990), "Sister Act" (1992). 
</P>
<P>
 Moments they, Oscar and everyone would prefer to forget: "Jumpin' Jack Flash" 
(1986), "Burglar" (1987), "Fatal Beauty" (1987), "The Telephone" (1988) -- can 
anyone explain how these movies are different? -- and playing someone with a 
brain tumor in the straight-to-video "Homer & Eddie" (1990). 
</P>
<P>
 Proof that they understand the crass world of Hollywood economics: She starred 
in "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit," in which an originally serious script 
about a real-life, inspirational choir teacher at South-Central high school was 
transformed into a wacky gag fest about gluing nuns to chairs.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside skinny from "The Encyclopedia of Film": "Made an affecting debut in 
'The Color Purple,' but her considerable talents were subsequentnly wasted in a 
series of uninspired vehicles." And this was before "Made in America" and 
"Sister Act 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Missteps involving makeup: Oh, there was that little Ted Danson-Friars Club 
thing you might have heard about ... 
</P>
<P>
 TV: Star Trek: The Next Generation." Also in the undistinguished "Bagdad Cafe" 
and "The Whoopi Goldberg Show," which nonetheless looks like brilliance next to 
Chevy Chase and Conan O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosting strengths: She's not Chevy Chase. To wit: She's funny, brash, 
opinionated and, best of all, unpredictable (at least when she's not in a 
movie). 
</P>
<P>
 Hosting weaknesses: Did you see "The Whoopi Goldberg Show"? Thought not. 
</P>
<P>
 Ability to fool some of the critics most of the time: Dramalogue called "Made 
in America" "a national treasure." Regarding "Sister Act 2" People magazine 
advised, "Say five Hail Whoopis and see it" -- baffled Americans wondered what 
sins they had committed to require such grave absolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Things that make you say, "Hmm," or at least, "excuse us?": Referring to 
presenters making unscheduled political statements on Oscar night, Goldberg 
told TV Guide, "You're not supposed to be political ... and then, of course 
they turn around and ask me to host it. I'm thinking 'Very interesting.' " 
Excuse us, but is this the best way to ingratiate herself to her employers?

SANTA ANA TAKES NEW OVERCROWDING TACK; HOUSING: OFFICIALS BACK BILL THAT WOULD 
LET CITIES SET TOUGHER OCCUPANCY LIMITS ON GROUNDS THAT CROWDING RAISES FIRE 
DANGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Santa Ana's years-long battle to limit the number of people who can cram 
into apartments and houses, a city overcrowding ordinance was deemed illegal by 
the courts, chided as a recipe for displacement by state housing officials and 
blasted as racist by Latino community activists. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new approach stressing increased fire danger as the key evil of 
overcrowding is raising proponents' hopes that a bill going before the state 
Senate Local Government Committee on Wednesday may be the city's most promising 
chance to wrest control of the issue from state hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, carried by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), would allow 
cities to set their own standards for housing occupancy, and Santa Ana 
officials are lobbying state lawmakers and scrambling for endorsements in a 
last-ditch frenzy to win support before the bill meets its first test in 
Sacramento next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we have found out that fire is an equal opportunity killer, it has become 
a more important issue," said City Councilman Robert L. Richardson, a main 
force behind the bill. "In our book, we have irrefutable evidence that there is 
a problem with the occupancy standard that the state makes us all salute. They 
either have to come to terms with leaving it be and killing people, or they can 
do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 After a major Santa Ana concession that grandfathers current residents and 
allows them to stay in their homes, the League of California Cities last year 
got behind the bill. Fire chiefs, including those in Oakland, Riverside and 
Lynwood, where two small children recently died in a garage fire, also support 
the measure, and three state fire associations have formally endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials in other Orange County cities, including Anaheim, San Clemente, 
Garden Grove and Dana Point, have offered support for the legislation, along 
with the Apartment Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 If it becomes law, Santa Ana could once again enact an ordinance that was 
deemed illegal by a state appellate court in 1992 for contradicting state 
guidelines. Under that ordinance, each unit with two occupants must have at 
least 150 square feet of living space, excluding kitchens, bathrooms and 
hallways, and another 100 square feet for each additional resident. That works 
out to four or five people in an average one-bedroom apartment, compared to the 
current, more lenient state standard of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say that the bill will not alleviate Santa Ana's crowding 
problems. What it will do, they say, is criminalize poor people and prompt 
landlords to discriminate against large families, many of whom are Latino in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain that the measure also could give slumlords an excuse to quietly 
condone overcrowding, and then evict tenants when they request repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income residents say the bill's grandfather clause offers them little 
solace. They fear that when it does come time for them to move, they will be 
frozen out of Santa Ana's already steep rental market. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there were fewer of us, we wouldn't be able to make the rent," said 
Guadalupe Flores, 25, who shares a two-bedroom apartment with her husband, 
their three small children and three other adults in a West Myrtle Street 
complex pegged by the city as overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, Manuel and Alicia Esquivel pondered their own situation.  
</P>
<P>
 Their two-bedroom apartment costs the same as the Flores' -- $600 a month plus 
about $100 in utilities. Manuel Esquivel makes $5.25 an hour as a landscaper, 
bringing home about $740 a month for himself, Alicia and their four small 
children. The reality has forced them to rent out one room to a young woman, 
but she recently told them she would be leaving at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to live with strangers, or with another family, but with my 
salary, we can barely make it," said Manuel Esquivel, 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Esquivel, 26, said she fears she would have trouble finding a cheaper 
apartment if the city begins restricting occupancy. She experienced a similar 
problem after giving birth to her fourth child, Isabel, now 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landlord said they wanted no more than two or three children. Well, what 
could we do? We have four!" she said as the children scrambled in and out of a 
cardboard clubhouse in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana officials have long argued that overcrowding strains the city's 
beleaguered school system, overloads the sewers and tests police abilities to 
serve the community. It also gives neighborhoods a blighted appearance and 
wears down property, amplifying other health and safety code violations, they 
say.  
</P>
<P>
 But after fire killed three people last January in a South Alder Street home 
believed to be overcrowded and melted copper wiring in the kitchen -- which 
happens only when temperatures reach 2,000 degrees -- Santa Ana Firefighter Jim 
Albers took up the issue with personal fervor. He has spent his own money to 
test a theory that apartments crammed with belongings burn faster and hotter, 
jeopardizing lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The data from two test burns set up by Albers are now being analyzed by 
computer, but initial results -- and a dramatic video of the first test -- 
indicate that overcrowded rooms did ignite more quickly and heat up much faster 
than rooms filled with "normal fire load." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real obvious to all firefighters that when these fires happen, they're 
going to be much more severe," said Albers, a 24-year veteran of the 
department.  
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen Santa Ana fire deaths between December, 1991, and January, 1993, were 
attributed by officials to overcrowded conditions. When several families are 
living under the same roof, they often have no idea who is in the room next 
door, or what was left to burn on the communal kitchen stove -- other factors 
that lead to confusion and increase the risk of fire, Fire Chief Allen (Bud) 
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary results from Albers' tests have helped garner statewide 
support for the Bergeson bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, Santa Ana city officials traveled to Sacramento to persuade as 
many legislators as possible to climb on board, securing a promise from Sen. 
Robert B. Presley (D-Riverside) to sign on as co-sponsor and getting support 
from Sen. Ruben S. Ayala (D-Rancho Cucamonga) they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. has been tracking down 
members of the Hispanic Caucus to sell them on the bill and head off expected 
criticism that overcrowding ordinances will come down particularly hard on 
low-income Latinos, who often live with extended families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it as a racist issue. Fire does not discriminate. If you're 
overcrowded and you're in a fire, it'll kill everyone," said Pulido, also a 
longtime proponent of regulating overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood associations throughout Santa Ana have been fighting for 
occupancy control for years, saying that large families and groups of men who 
share apartments near them are reducing property values, running down the 
housing and putting lives in danger by subjecting tenants to fire risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood groups from Thornton Park, Valley High, Northeast, Floral Park 
and more than half a dozen other areas have taken up the issue in recent months 
in a letter-writing campaign designed to urge local legislators to sign on to 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "My issue is property value starts going down when people come in to the 
neighborhood to buy, and they see people constantly leaning out of their 
balconies, hanging out on the streets, because there's just not enough room," 
said resident Jim Kendrick, who is active in the French Court Neighborhood 
Assn. There are about 1,100 apartments in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bill may just prompt other, more affluent Orange County cities to build 
their fair share of low-income housing, Kendrick added.  
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want the low-income people. They want their gardeners. They want 
their baby-sitters, but there's no place affordable for them to live, so they 
end up taking over neighborhoods. The whole kitchen staff from one restaurant 
may live together," Kendrick said.

 Community housing activists counter, however, that the bill is not the answer 
to Santa Ana's overcrowding problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're defining a new class of illegal people, based on whether they're 
working in a $4.35 an hour job," said housing rights attorney Richard Spix, who 
successfully challenged the city's initial ordinance. "They're going to stay in 
the one-bedroom place because they have a blue-collar job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has determined that 50 square feet per person meets health 
standards. When we're talking about housing people, we're talking about meeting 
their minimum health requirements," Spix said. "We're not talking about what 
would be ideal in terms of middle-class living arrangements. The alternative is 
no housing whatsoever for many of these people." 
</P>
<P>
 And, activists say, unscrupulous landlords will take advantage of tenants, as 
many did when the city implemented its ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the blue-collar rental market, where we anticipate finding the most 
overcrowding, you're going to see landlords winking and nodding, that they 
don't really care how many babies their tenants have until the time when their 
tenants might ask for some repairs," he said. "They're going to be living with 
deplorable conditions because they'll be afraid of being kicked out." Crowd

IT'S TIME OF THE SEASON FOR HAY FEVER VICTIMS 
</P>

 It's hay fever season again. 
</P>
<P>
 But you hardly need to be reminded if you're among the estimated 20% of 
Americans with pollen allergies. That means eyeballs that itch, noses that run 
and stuffed-up heads that feel about ready to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 The symptoms probably showed up in the San Fernando Valley during the past 
couple of weeks, brought on by the recent spell of unusually warm and sometimes 
windy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, allergy experts say the pollen levels in the air are normal for this 
time of year. But it is still early and for many people the worst is yet to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, this year's sneezing season may turn out to be milder than last 
year's. The heavy winter rains last year made trees and plants grow like crazy. 
By comparison, this past winter was dry. 
</P>
<P>
 "As near as I can tell, it looks like a normal hay fever season," said Zeb 
Dyer, an allergy researcher at the Santa Barbara Medical Foundation Clinic. 
"But it all depends on the weather from here on out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rain would help wash some of these pollens out of the air," he said. "But if 
we have a lot of dry, windy days dispersing pollen all over the place, there 
are going to be a lot of sick people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some allergy sufferers are having a harder time of it this year because of the 
Northridge earthquake. Aftershocks from the Jan. 17 temblor continue to kick up 
lots of dust to irritate already sore noses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Donald L. Unger, an allergist who practices in Thousand Oaks, added that 
molds, growing in damp cracks of quake-damaged homes and offices, are also a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of my patients who are mold-sensitive are having a heck of a time," 
Unger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, pollinating trees are the biggest problem for most people, 
especially the Arizona cypress, coast live oak and olive. 
</P>
<P>
 But far more hay fever sufferers are allergic to pollen manufactured by 
grasses, such as false ragweed and other relatives of the best-known hay fever 
producer, Bermuda grass, Timothy grass and fescue. 
</P>
<P>
 And grasses won't begin pollinating in earnest for another couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, "people with asthma will also be having more symptoms," said Dr. 
Wayne E. Imber, an Encino allergist. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other allergy experts say the best thing a sufferer can do is identify 
the source of the problem and try to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other survival tips: Stay indoors if possible during the early morning and 
afternoon hours, when pollen levels are highest. If you have to go outside at 
those times, change clothes when you get home and wash your hair to get rid of 
pollen. Use an air conditioner indoors with a good filter. Imber said many hay 
fever sufferers can get through the season with non-prescription remedies, such 
as eyedrops, antihistamines and nasal sprays. 
</P>
<P>
 If those don't work, other allergists recommend several relatively new 
prescription antihistamines that are non-sedating, including Seldane, Hismanal 
and Claritin. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are new prescription steroid nasal sprays that work well without 
the serious side effects of other medicines containing steroids. 
</P>
<P>
 If all else fails, allergy shots are probably the answer. The shots, initially 
once a week then with decreasing frequency for at least six months, almost 
always work. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the literature, they're 90% effective," Imber said. Springtime
