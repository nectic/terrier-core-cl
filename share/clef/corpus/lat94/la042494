<P>
 With the elite media wallowing in shamelessness, their packs of so-called 
journalists hounding after that which is most salacious and frivolous, it is 
refreshing to visit a retrospective of this bard of the tabloids. For six 
decades in the pages of the New York Post, New York Newsday and whatever 
magazines would have him, Kempton has plied the craft that the First Amendment 
was designed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that he appeared in the tabloids is a comment less on him and them 
than it is on the New York Times, which should have been the natural venue for 
the finest writer ever to cover New York and, through it, the world. But good 
writers, like other artists of integrity, can never be hobbled by the tastes of 
gallery owners who might or might not choose to hang their works. They will, 
the great ones, insist on getting it right even if only to hang it on a subway 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm gushing, I know. But I have loved Murray Kempton's work ever since I began 
reading him as a kid in the 1950s, in the New York Post. It was required 
reading in my part of the Bronx. "You saw Kempton?" my garment-worker mother 
would ask by way of opening a free-ranging dinner conversation on subjects as 
varied as nuclear war, the Mafia or Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 I mention my mother's occupation only to challenge the snobbism that might 
suggest that less-educated readers of the tabloids are unable or unwilling to 
parse what are arguably the most pungent -- and complex -- sentences written by 
anyone this side of Shakespeare, let alone a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Which may explain the mutual admiration felt by the liberal Kempton and the 
conservative William Buckley to whom this book is dedicated. Enjoying Kempton's 
prose is an acquired and addictive habit, like doing a crossword puzzle, or 
reading the classics. And while that may be why Kempton is not syndicated 
widely, this wonderful selection of three decades of Kempton columns confirms 
that the slight effort involved is well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages, about who and what we are, prove timeless, making this an 
essential book for study. But it is also a delight to dip into for a quick 
three-page random read. Making this especially easy is a detailed index wherein 
one can look up Malcolm X, Dwight Eisenhower, Karl Marx, or say, Richard Nixon, 
now sadly in the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1966, Kempton wrote in the Post about encountering Nixon at the 
Overseas Press Club: 
</P>
<P>
 "His smile across the room at the intruder is almost and unexpectedly 
beseeching. The first thought is that he is faintly crying mercy; but he must 
long ago have ceased to expect mercy anywhere; a man who has so doggedly 
followed his star without ever asking quarter from history is certainly above 
asking mercy from journalists . . . this is a man who, say what you choose of 
him, came to run the course. He will, with time, be a landmark in the history 
of quiet, determined desperation. . . . We will end surprised to discover that 
we love him. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 On the death of Martin Luther King Jr. and the riots that followed: "He died 
asserting the dignity of garbage collectors. And he died at a moment when his 
ideas had never seemed quite so unfashionable. We have been very sick; a 
country is sick when the second thought in everyone's mind with the news that a 
Nobel Peace laureate has been murdered can be the fear that his death is the 
signal for violence and arson and that his first memorial must be children 
fleeing from a burning tenement." 
</P>
<P>
 On an auction of the address book of Marilyn Monroe: "There is a note to 'call 
Jack at 11 o'clock' that has set the gossips to imagining the beat of great 
wings overhead; but since the year was 1957, the odds are that this Jack was 
only her hairdresser." 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton is ever the contrarian -- as in his acceptance of the guilt of accused 
atom-spy Alger Hiss, heresy in left-liberal circles -- and yet he is rarely 
unforgiving. Noting that Hiss, as a federal prisoner, conducted himself with 
dignity even to the point of winning the respect of fellow cons, Kempton wrote: 
"Think though I always have that his jury was correct, I shall never dismiss 
Alger Hiss as no better than a traitor so long as I know that he never finked 
at Lewisburg." 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton's greatest achievement is as a debunker of conspiracies, especially 
those concerning the Mafia, reminding us that ordinary life is naturally so 
filled with inexplicable contradiction and mystery as to mock all attempts to 
define an overarching plan imposed by mortals. 
</P>
<P>
 Like I. F. Stone, his only peer, Kempton bases his journalism as much as 
possible on what is known of the actual record. Perusing the transcripts of FBI 
wiretaps of reputed Cosa Nostra boss Simone Rizzo (Sam) DeCavalcante, Kempton 
discovers what those who make a living alarming us about the Mafia pointedly 
ignore -- that they are by and large penny-ante losers. DeCavalcante, operating 
from the "power center" of the Elizabeth, N.J., hod carriers union, was 
constantly the recipient of complaints from his "soldiers" about not being able 
to pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the FBI tape, one such soldier, Frank Cocchiaro, "told 
DeCavalcante that he has money problems as he gives his wife $50 a week, pays 
$125 a month rent in N.J. and $115 rent per month for his wife." Chump change 
you might say. As Kempton notes, being in that Mafia world "is clearly not an 
environment productive of millionaires." 
</P>
<P>
 In a long 1969 essay in the New York Review of Books, Kempton reminds the 
authors of two major works, one a journalist and the other a professor, that 
when it comes to the mob their sense of proportion is all wrong. Conceding that 
they are tops in their field he notes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Yet read alongside the real life of Sam DeCavalcante, the reports of these 
two authorities seem astoundingly credulous, the journalist and the academic 
being our chief sources of social misinformation. One of the few knowledgeable 
persons I can imagine believing them is Sam DeCavalcante himself; the faith of 
witches and of the hunters of witches survives the failure of witchcraft." 
</P>
<P>
 With Kempton it is not a matter of being arrogant but rather of being precise. 
He takes as his task the fine tuning of our consciousness so that we can hold 
ourselves and others accountable -- the highest calling of a free press in a 
democracy. Often this entails revisiting precincts no longer in the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you remember Charlotte Street in the Bronx? No? Well Murray Kempton does. 
Charlotte Street was once the favorite backdrop for journalists who journeyed 
with then-President Jimmy Carter to the burned-out borough to promise its 
revitalization. It didn't happen, instead becoming an opportunity for the 
Reagan Administration to once again "prove" that social programs don't work by 
using the power of the presidency to subvert them. The Wedtech Co. scandal is 
merely one example. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton revisited this shame on the occasion of the arraignment of Wedtech 
President Fred Neuberger, whose Bronx-based company had ripped off millions of 
Defense Department dollars intended to create jobs for the poor. Kempton 
offered this as proof positive that organized society does indeed care about 
what happens to poor people. "If organized society had not cared about 
Charlotte Street, Fred Neuberger would not have been able to move to Sutton 
Place in Manhattan and still be man of substance enough to afford a $1-million 
bail bond after pleading guilty to grand larceny." 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton goes on to co-opt the language of law and order for the cause of class 
justice. "Neuberger and his friends are gougers; they stole in the name of the 
poor, and they have cheated the poor of one of their scanty few hopes. They 
belong in jail until they rot like Charlotte Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God Murray Kempton has great memory and genes that permit him at age 76 
-- and as good as ever -- to put his wit at our service. Who else is there to 
remind today's trendy journalists that history extends beyond last week's 
lunch, that books are meant to be read, and that a writer's prose should be 
expected to inform as well as sell? When they gave him the Pulitzer in 1985, 
when he was nearly 70, they should have been deeply ashamed that it took so 
long.

YOU TELL 'EM; H.L. MENCKEN CONTINUES TO DISTURB THE PEACE; MENCKEN: A LIFE, BY 
FRED HOBSON (RANDOM HOUSE: $35; 672 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Molly Ivins, The author of Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She? (Random 
House), Ivins is a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even Henry Louis Mencken can't get away with being a curmudgeon anymore. In 
recent years his prejudices have been inspected for serious political 
"incorrectitude," his mental health pored over by prescribers of prophylactic 
doses of anti-depressants and his decline into mumpishness decried as though he 
hadn't been entitled to become an old crank. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, Mencken, where is thy sting now that we really need it? 
</P>
<P>
 The curmudgeon shortage in this country is critical -- sitting around grousing 
that the world is going to hell on a sled doesn't cut it. "Curmudgeonry" 
requires style and a talent for invective that only a few masters (e.g., Robert 
Sherrill) can provide anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 As literary biographer Fred Hobson shows in this lucid and respectful work, 
Mencken, who began his career in curmudgeonry before he was 21, made it into an 
art form. Born into a Baltimore German family in 1880, Mencken went to 
university in the city room of the Baltimore Morning Herald. All his life he 
retained the raucous and ribald glee with which good national reporters attack 
bunkum (or at least as so many of them used to before moving within the Beltway 
and developing terminal cases of self-importance). 
</P>
<P>
 By 1914 Mencken was already a noted literary critic and author of an admiring 
work on Nietzsche. As Fred Hobson demonstrates, all the planks of Mencken's 
intellectual platform were already in place, but they seem to have been 
cemented by the bitter experience of being pro-German during World War I. 
Mencken's "Germanophilia" was not so much political as cultural -- he was an 
intellectual snob and proud of it. He sought in his own German family roots an 
identity with what he considered the intellectual aristocracy. Those who were 
opposed to the war in Vietnam may remember a famous headline in Ramparts from 
that era: "What Do You Do When Your Country Is at War And You Think the Other 
Side Should Win?" Many of the '60s radicals wound up, improbably, like the 
arch-conservative Mencken in the '20s -- hypercritical of their own country. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that we ever lack a rich and inviting array of big, fat juicy targets in 
this great nation, but the '20s were almost made for Mencken's pen. The 
decade's splendid run of general silliness included fatuous academics and 
pinheaded fundamentalists, as well as the usual dweebs, dorks and crooks of 
public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson, nevertheless, persuasively makes the case that Mencken's importance as 
a social critic is dwarfed by his role in American literature. Indeed, the list 
of authors he published first in "The Smart Set" and later in "The American 
Mercury" reads like the Modern American Library. There was nothing conservative 
about Mencken's literary judgment -- it was as close to infallible as one human 
being can get in the course of a lifetime. His early devotion to Mark Twain was 
followed by a passion for Theodore Dreiser's realism and then the nurturing of 
such an astonishing range of talent that it's far easier to list whom he missed 
than whom he noticed. (He never thought that much of Hemingway and published 
only a bit of T. S. Eliot.) 
</P>
<P>
 As Hobson writes, Mencken "published fiction by Dreiser, Fitzgerald, Cabell, 
Sherwood Anderson and Dorothy Parker and poetry by Carl Sandburg, Vachel 
Lindsay, Edgar Lee Masters and Louis Untermeyer . . . nonfiction contributors 
for the two years (of The American Mercury) include Clarence Darrow, Charles 
Beard, Upton Sinclair, Carl Van Vechten, Waldo Frank, Margaret Sanger, Max 
Eastman, Emma Goldman, Joseph Wood Krutch, Carl Van Doren, Ernest Boyd, Arthur 
Krock, Josephine Herbst, Bernard De Voto and Sinclair Lewis." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent controversy over Mencken has centered on his alleged racism and 
anti-Semitism, since the prejudiced old grouch does not measure up to the 
genteel verbal standards of our day. But as Hobson demonstrates, Mencken "was 
receptive to black writers, without question more helpful than any other editor 
of his time." Among his friends he counted W. E. B. DuBois, Countee Cullen, 
James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes and George Schuyler. But Mencken also was 
capable of calling blacks "coons" and sadly, he once went so far as to write, 
"The vast majority of their race are but one of two inches removed from 
gorillas." 
</P>
<P>
 "Such a record would seem to condemn Mencken outright," Hudson argues, "and 
yet, if his utterances at times suggested severe racial prejudice, at other 
times his words -- and more particularly, his actions -- seem, given his time 
and place, a virtual testimony to racial enlightenment." Hobson contends that 
Mencken, in regards to both blacks and Jews, was not prejudiced but "verbally 
insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, is a big stretch, for while it's true that Mencken was never 
given to understatement ("lowerbole" was not his game), he was, after all, the 
author of "The American Language," still considered by many the best work ever 
printed on the subject. It's not easy to think of America's Samuel Johnson as 
"verbally insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson comes closer to the truth, I think, with this observation: "(Mencken) 
was alternately blessed and cursed, by nature he would say, both by a penchant 
for colorful and explosive language -- hyperbole, slang and epithets -- and by 
a need to categorize and to abstract everything, including nations, regions, 
religions and ethnic groups. Thus, rhetorically at least, he lived life more 
dramatically than most other mortals, attempted more, risked more, said more 
and said it more colorfully on a wider range of subjects than perhaps any other 
writer of his generation. The result, depending on what he came out with at any 
given time, was that he appeared to be both the best friend and the worst enemy 
of Jews, blacks and numerous other segments of the population." 
</P>
<P>
 As I know to my sorrow, the risks of constantly cranking out opinions into 
short newspaper columns are glib generalization, superficial analysis and 
self-contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mencken's diaries were posthumously published in 1981 and 1989, they 
touched off a fine brouhaha, as did the 1991 publication of Mencken's 
unflattering memoir, "My Life as Author and Editor." On top of being called 
racist, anti-Semitic and misogynist, Mencken now stood accused of being a 
disloyal friend and all-round misanthrope. Hobson's book helps us understand 
why Mencken's world had become so dark even before his crippling stroke in 
1948. That Mencken lived another eight years after he was deprived of the 
ability to read and write was an agonizing tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mencken's judgments on many of the writers he knew are harsh, it is a 
fact that a remarkable number of them were raging alcoholics with the 
unpleasant habit of borrowing money and not returning it. Also remarkable is 
Mencken's generosity: He often helped pay all or part of other people's medical 
bills, for example, including those of the dying American progressive Emma 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson's book leaves me liking Mencken neither more nor less than I ever did: 
I always both adored his work and disagreed with him, especially about 
democracy. Hobson does, however, give me a great deal more respect for Mencken. 
</P>
<P>
 Working hard is not a fashionable virtue, except among those who like to dwell 
on the manifold moral failings of poor folks. But the sheer amount of work 
Mencken turned out is as impressive as its caliber. I even like the 
strait-laced side and the old-fashion decency of this famous attacker of 
Puritanism. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, however, one knows that in Mencken, there stood a man you'd want to 
have a beer with.

THE WISE, THE WORLDLY AND THE WICKED; DIPLOMACY, BY HENRY KISSINGER (SIMON & 
SCHUSTER: $35; 912 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Fromkin, David Fromkin, the author of A Peace to End All Peace: 
Creating the Modern Middle East (Avon) has just finished a book about American 
world policy 1880-1961 to be published by Alfred A. Knopf in February 1995. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each new American President chooses those of his predecessors whose portraits 
he wants to hang in the Cabinet Room. In the Nixon White House, certainly 
Eisenhower, Nixon's political patron, had to be one of them, but "the President 
most admired by Nixon," Henry Kissinger tells us in this analysis of European 
and American diplomacy, "was Woodrow Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Roosevelt also chose to hang Wilson's portrait in the Cabinet Room. 
But he did so in a somewhat different spirit: he wanted to be reminded 
constantly of who he did not want to be. Robert Sherwood, one of FDR's 
principal speech writers, remembered: 
</P>
<P>
 "As Roosevelt sat at the end of the long table in the Cabinet Room working on. 
. .speeches during the war years, he would look up at the portrait of Woodrow 
Wilson, over the mantelpiece. The tragedy of Wilson was always somewhere within 
the rim of his consciousness. Roosevelt could never forget Wilson's mistakes. . 
.and there were was no motivating force in all of Roosevelt's wartime political 
policy stronger than the determination to prevent repetition of the same 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Wilson whose spirit was conjured up by President Bush in pretending 
that the Gulf War was a step on the road to a New World Order. And it is 
Wilson's ghost that must be appeased if Americans, in their idealism, ever are 
to support with any genuine enthusiasm the Realpolitik or practical politics 
that Kissinger proposes in the final chapter of "Diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was the President who brought the United States out of the western 
hemisphere and into the wars and politics of the world. He did not do so 
willingly. Like his countrymen and his predecessors, he believed that Americans 
should focus on fulfilling their dreams in their own sector of the globe. He 
agreed with his fellow Americans that the politics of Europe -- which then 
dominated all of the planet outside our hemisphere -- were not only corrupt but 
corrupting; and that it would be dangerous for us to become ensnared in them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's United States was given no real choice. Germany went back to 
unrestricted U-boat warfare in 1917, and sank the U.S. merchantman Algonquin on 
March 12; three more American merchant vessels March 18; and another, the 
Aztec, on April 1. These five sinkings (though Kissinger claims it was that of 
the liner Lusitania two years earlier) were the proximate cause of American 
entry into the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in breaking with America's isolationist past, though, Wilson reaffirmed 
its underpinnings. In his view Europe's politics remained corrupt and 
corrupting; so, since the United States no longer had the option of staying out 
of them, it had no alternative but to change them. The countries of Europe, 
Allied and enemy alike, were going to have to be persuaded to give up trade 
barriers, empires, militarism, and foreign policies that were motivated solely 
by selfish material interests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the somewhat misleadingly titled "Diplomacy," Kissinger outlines the 
international relations of the European great powers from the 17th Century 
onward in order to contrast their theory and practice with those urged upon the 
world by the American government between 1917 and 1919. This conflict between 
wise and worldly but often wicked Europe, and foolish and naive but often 
virtuous America, has been a quarrel running through the 20th Century; and it 
provides Kissinger with his theme. He makes sympathetic comments about 
statesmen on both sides, but seems especially admiring of the morally 
deplorable Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 His point is that the United States has much to learn from the realism -- some 
would say, cynicism -- of such historical figures as Cardinal Richelieu. 
Richeliue was a Roman Catholic prelate but at the same time was the chief 
minister of the King of France. It was the first half of the 1600s, and war 
raged across Europe between Catholics and Protestants. The Cardinal 
opportunistically threw France's support to the Protestants, subordinating the 
interests of his church and whatever religious principles he may have had to 
his goal of making his country the most powerful in Europe. Kissinger approves. 
</P>
<P>
 For hundreds of pages, in a simplified college outlinestyle, Kissinger 
recounts such selected tales from history. His goal, it transpires, is to 
persuade his readers that leaders who are devious, who scheme, who lie, who are 
unscrupulous, who will throw beliefs and principles overboard to see their 
country get ahead -- leaders such as Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger are said to have been -- often accomplish more good than an 
idealist like Woodrow Wilson does. But whether what Nixon and Kissinger did 
when in power, especially in Vietnam, proved the superiority of their approach 
to foreign policy, is open to question. 
</P>
<P>
 The author's idea is to call all of modern history to bear witness to the 
proposition that, much as liberals may deplore their methods, the Kissingers 
and Nixons of this world achieve the results that liberals and idealists want 
to see achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger's ambition is grand -- he wants to help America's idealistic foreign 
policy makers and followers learn from Europe's more realistic power 
politicians -- but it falters in the execution. It is not a matter of mistakes; 
those are to be expected in the book trade nowadays: fact checkers are not what 
they used to be. The problem is that the author has not always mastered his 
material. An example: his treatment of the career of John Foster Dulles. 
</P>
<P>
 In about 1941 Dulles became an active religious layman and headed a Protestant 
church group preparing plans for an international organization to preserve 
peace in the postwar world. Kissinger wrongly tells us that this was Dulles's 
"first experience with international affairs.' In fact Dulles began in 1907, as 
secretary to his grandfather, who served as China's representative to the 
Second International Peace Conference at the Hague. He was involved in 
international affairs from then on. 
</P>
<P>
 Dulles was in complete charge of foreign policy for Thomas E. Dewey, front 
runner for the Republican presidential nomination between 1938 and 1940. An 
apologist for Nazi Germany and an opponent of U.S. aid to Britain, Dulles was 
the architect of the isolationist program on which Dewey ran in 1940. One has 
to know that in order to appreciate the bridge back to internationalism that 
Dulles constructed for himself, as war approached. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger's ignorance of Dulles' background leads him to suppose that Article 
231 of the Versailles Treaty, the "war guilt clause," was intended to provide 
"moral justification" for the reparations that followed World War I. But had 
Kissinger known that clause 231 was crafted by Dulles, then a lawyer acting in 
a legal capacity, he might have surmised more plausibly that the clause aimed 
to provide legal , not moral, justification. 
</P>
<P>
 The Allies wanted Germany to sign a treaty committing her to pay reparations, 
but were unable to agree on a specific figure. They decided to commit Germany 
to pay but not tell her the amount until later, a strategy that led to the 
German resentment that some say spurred the rise of Nazism. That was the legal 
problem Dulles resolved by drafting for Germany's signature an admission of 
liability so broad that it provided a basis for German responsibility to pay 
whatever the Allies demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 As a student, Dulles had attended Wilson's lectures at Princeton; he 
hero-worshipped the President. It was odd that he and his idol allowed 
themselves to be won over to the bad old entangling politics that Wilson had 
warned against. 
</P>
<P>
 Curious: America's military and political enemies among the great powers of 
Europe were Great Britain in the 19th Century, and Germany and then Russia in 
the 20th, but our intellectual adversary throughout has been France. As 
Kissinger points out, however, France's leading statesman, Gen. Charles de 
Gaulle, was only the latest exponent of a politically amoral view of statecraft 
that went back to Richelieu -- and before. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissinger is brilliantly right about this. Moreover he has much of value to 
say, particularly in his last chapter, about how to retain the idealism in 
American policy while learning from Europe how to hedge it with realism. A 
Wilson may start us on the road to the Promised Land, but it takes a leader 
more worldly wise -- a Theodore Roosevelt, a Nixon, or a Reagan, in Kissinger's 
view; a Theodore or Franklin Roosevelt in mine -- to get us there.

 For building purposes, a dream is at least as important as sand and cement. In 
1887, the Riviera was still a place of ornate mansions, 50-servant 
establishments and European crowned heads sharing pillows with such resplendent 
courtesans as La Belle Otero and Liane de Pougy. Then the poet-promoter Stephen 
Liegeard published a rhapsodic book entitled "La Cote d'Azur." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dream of a phrase; as Mary Blume writes: "The Riviera is the entire 
French-Italian coastline, the Cote d'Azur is its myth." As much as the 
sunshine, blue water and pretty coast, a whole chain of myths -- Victorian 
moneyed discomfort and Edwardian moneyed pleasure, Jazz Age extravagance, 
film-festival glamour and the lavish decadence of tax-sheltered high-rollers -- 
has made the place what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Or rather, what it seems to be. The product of a dream is morning's grit in 
the eye. The product of the Cote d'Azur is polluted beaches, package tours, 
white unbroken stretches of high-rises and a shore of which one-quarter is 
under concrete. It is still a dream-like shock to fly in from the north over 
the hazy blue Bay of Angels, and glimpse the slow green-and-white curve toward 
Antibes and Cannes to the left, and Cap Ferrat and Menton to the right. 
Disquiet sets in with the airport taxi ride; we seem to be moving through 
someone else's dream or, rather, through a whole hungry mob of other people's 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreams and their expropriation are the center of Mary Blume's "La Cote 
d'Azur," with its parade of grand dukes, artists, writers, con men, gangsters, 
millionaire escapists, hard-eyed promoters, nuts, solipsists and Cannes' 
white-bearded Mayor Capron, who rode his white horse to visit the poor each 
morning, and continued on to the railroad station to meet arriving royalty. 
Also Mayor Capron's daughter, who saved the lives of 400 Jewish schoolchildren 
by faking their identity papers. Asked much later why she had the Legion 
d'Honneur, she replied as only one particular kind of old French woman might: 
"I was a good little girl. I ate my soup." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Blume is better known in Europe than here. For several decades she has 
written features for the International Herald Tribune that are not quite like 
anything else in American journalism. She is as distinctive as Art Buchwald, 
who was funny in Paris before coming home to be funny in the United States. She 
can be funny too -- the humor comes not from what she says but from what she 
brings out in others -- but it is not her purpose; a kind of social comedy is. 
Her subjects tend to be figures in the arts and society but she is not a 
celebrity writer. She writes the things her subjects know about themselves and 
also, without making a point of it, one or two things they don't know. Her 
locus is the uncertain connecting passage between the person and the personage. 
If Edith Wharton had been a journalist, perhaps she would have written a little 
like Blume. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the easiest kind of stretch, nor is a book the easiest form for a 
writer whose art has shaped itself so finely to a newspaper's columns. The 
social, cultural and dream history in "Cote d'Azur," running from the mid-19th 
Century to the present-day, is a melange of splendid anecdotes and pedestrian 
ones, luminous passages -- some of them quoted from interviews or memoirs, but 
many of the Blume's own -- and intervals that are relatively flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Blume brackets her retrospective with a lively, two-part portrait of Nice and 
its popular and crooked long-time mayor, Jacques Medecin, who is last seen 
selling T-shirts in Uruguay after being convicted of various financial misdeeds 
or, in Nicois parlance, salades. Blume gives us Medecin's recipe for Salade 
Nicoise and his contempt for the way Parisians make it, and for Parisians in 
general. "They are egotistical; they despise the rest of the country. They 
forget to wash most of the time, especially their feet." It is the 
French-Mediterranean resentment of the north of France; a resentment that comes 
out in Alexandre Dumas' account of an early 19th-Century Riviera innkeeper who 
said that he had some "Anglais" guests but wasn't sure whether they were French 
"Anglais" or German. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent invasion, which the locals resented and prospered from, began in 
the 1830s, when Lord Brougham became the first Englishman to build a villa at 
Cannes, and a friend's gardener became the first English real-estate agent. 
Blume writes of Queen Victoria, sunproof in hat and shawls, being served by 
Indian butlers whom the Aga Khan knowledgeably declared to be second-rate. (One 
of the many splendid photographs in the book shows Victoria at tea: teapot to 
teapot.) She writes of a swarm of Russian dukes, one of whom shot a police 
inspector under the impression that he was a nihilist. She quotes Liane de 
Pougy's inventory of her own looks: "Hazel-green eyes, not terribly large but 
my gaze is large." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborately formal display was followed after World War I by the much more 
enjoyable carousing of the Fitzgerald-Hemingway-Maugham generation. Summer 
became the season instead of winter; suntans replaced fashionable pallor. The 
wealthy and aristocratic, no longer sufficient unto themselves, cultivated 
artists, writers and musicians. Blume writes of Gerald and Sara Murphy as joint 
Masters of the Revels; and she quotes from Gerald's letter to Scott Fitzgerald 
after the fun had faded and two of the Murphys' children had died: "Only the 
invented part of our lives -- the unreal part -- has had any scheme, any 
beauty. Life has stepped in now and blundered, scarred and destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 The author tells of the wartime shutdown -- one Englishman drove his Rolls 
into the sea so the Italians wouldn't get it -- and the postwar boom. Her 
portrait of Monte Carlo as a tightly policed, stuffy haven for the super-rich 
is particularly telling. Money no longer goes in for public display or 
enjoyment on the Cote d'Azur; it is no longer a playground for fantasy and 
escape. "Escape," she writes, "with its sense of generous adventure, is a large 
word for our times; the search has narrowed to privacy and safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Blume writes with irony and regret, neither doting nor excoriating. She writes 
with the coolness of someone whose heart is not in the actual present or past 
but in her dream; located, I would estimate, somewhere between the late 1920s 
and early '30s, somewhere between Bandol and Hyeres.

DISSECTIONS OF LOVE AND DEATH; VARIOUS ANTIDOTES: STORIES, BY JOANNA SCOTT 
(HENRY HOLT: $20; 240 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Liza Pennywitt Taylor, Taylor's first novel, The Drummer Was the First to 
Die, was published in 1992 by St. Martin's Press. 
</P>

 The Cambridge University Museum of Zoology houses the enormous skeleton of an 
African bull elephant shot in 1884 by a Mr. W. Heape of Trinity College. 
Surrounding it march the bones of extinct and still-living species, all 
collected before 1900, jumbled together and apparently arranged by size rather 
than habitat or species. Wooly mammoths, giant 20-foot sloths, killer whales 
and tiny vertebrates such as shrews and mule deer and mole rats, all glare at 
the visitor through their century-old hollow eye sockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Scott's absorbing and entertaining collection of short stories bears a 
remarkable likeness to this museum display. Discoveries of bee habits, lenses, 
chloroform and a lab worker with the gene for Huntington's Chorea people these 
11 examinations of men and women who examine the human race. 
</P>
<P>
 But science, to many readers, can be dull, so I should say straight off that 
although Scott uses science as a scaffold for these gripping vignettes, the 
majority are really about love and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone in these stories is in love, and death is frequent. No fewer 
than 26 executions take place. Though most are of people, one is of the 
celebrated Coney Island elephant Topsy who was executed around 1910 by public 
electrocution, for mauling too many caretakers. All these executed characters, 
whether they die literally or figuratively, are loved. Even Topsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Corday's nameless female cousin, a cook, loved Charlotte to 
distraction; she mourns her young cousin through rhapsodies on the legendary 
onion sauce she used to cook for the girl before Charlotte was so insane as to 
go off to Paris and murder Marat. Afraid for her own life if her 
anti-revolutionary grief goes public, the cook confines herself to the grand 
gesture of never making the sauce again. 
</P>
<P>
 A family of body snatchers who provide corpses for anatomy classes get 
themselves executed because they lose patience with one healthy young specimen; 
after all, he only needed a little strangling to make him salable. Yet they 
love each other even as they watch one another be hanged and wait for their own 
turns at the noose. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Leeuvenhoek, the inventor of the microscope, takes his loving daughter so 
for granted that his endearments for the flies he dissects carry more emotion 
than his words for her. His incestuous embrace is enough to produce from her 
the tear he needs to study under his remarkable lens. 
</P>
<P>
 As varied and beautifully imagined as many of these scenes are, and as 
meticulously researched (at least they seem that way, which is what counts in 
historical fiction), a few effects are repeated enough to reach sameness. 
Dorothea Dix, a champion for the maltreated insane women of the 19th Century, 
begins to sound in her late-life ramblings not too different from the solitary 
old woman bewitched by the elephant's electrocution. The bee master, the 
childbirth expert and the hypnotist's ex-lover all seem to have their grudges 
against the world. Musings of badly understood genius don't bear much 
repetition. 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight of Scott's gifts, on the other hand, is her repeated knack of 
slowing down death. If it weren't so well done it would be easier to bear. At 
the Place de la Concorde, mashed against the sweating, shocked cook, we see the 
guillotine's slow descent to Charlotte Corday's neck. When mice are "tumbled" 
to death in a revolving drum as a scientific study of falling bodies, the 
spilled cedar chips and mouse pellets crunch under our shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 This grim super-realism may reflect Scott's absorption with the pathos and 
solitude of an exploring mind, and can serve to ask the question of how 
possible it is to exist as a thinking human in anything except a solitary 
state. Whatever their literary purpose, all those deaths were heavy going, 
despite their fanciful reframing and the supposed remoteness of history. This 
very remoteness could perhaps have made the deaths unreal, when in fact it 
rendered them eternal. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the comprehensively arranged skeletons waiting forever in the zoology 
museum, these episodes wait to be read, examined and revisited.

COVER STORY: SECRETARIES, THEN . . . AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretaries come and go on TV. Hairstyles, clothing, duties -- some 
secretaries are called executive assistants these days -- and work stations 
have changed with the times. But, basically, personalities seem to stay the 
same: Most are efficient, like the perfect secretary, Della Street; cocky, like 
Mildred Krebs; smarter than the boss, like Carol Kester; protective, like Jules 
Bennett, and frequently meddlesome, like Susie McNamera. But through it all, 
they were always endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 In honor of National Secretaries Day on Wednesday, we salute these unsung 
heroes, too often taken for granted in real life and reel life. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 OFFICE NAME: Toby Pedalbee 
</P>
<P>
 BUSINESS: Publishing 
</P>
<P>
 BOSS' NAME: Martin Tupper (Brian Benben) 
</P>
<P>
 DUTIES: Catch up on personal phone calls; never bring the boss coffee but make 
sure she has a nice cappuccino; file her nails; make a shopping list of 
errands; never do the boss' work; take long lunches; talk back to the boss; 
eavesdrop when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 DRESS CODE: Attractive, upbeat solid-colored suits accented with silk blouses; 
often wears a pin with a phone off the hook. Leaves her leather dominatrix 
outfit at home for the second job. 
</P>
<P>
 PERFORMANCE REVIEW: Only gives message if she feels like it, but makes sure 
that all manuscripts get to the printer in time, since Martin's often too busy 
in bed to remember deadlines; offers an opinion on everything, including 
Martin's revolving-door social life; gets her personal business done as well as 
his. 
</P>
<P>
 DELLA STREET FACTOR: Pushes the envelope to see how far she can go and not get 
fired, but is always on top of everything; secretly a great secretary; has her 
own separate filing system that Martin can't figure out; files according to her 
opinions, such as filing under "M" for moron or "J" for jerk. 
</P>
<P>
 QUIRKS: Often needs to leave work early to (A) Catch the soaps or (B) Visit 
one of her incarcerated relatives; also talks incessantly -- and at length -- 
about her relatives; her filing system makes her irreplaceable. 
</P>
<P>
 WORDS TO WORK BY: "Do it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 PROMOTION QUOTIENT: High. Sitting on some great ideas like the pop-up Pope 
book; knows that it will help her become the editor and/or writer she wants to

</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ACTRESS: Penny Johnson of "The Larry Sanders Show" 
</P>
<P>
 OFFICE NAME: Beverly Barnes 
</P>
<P>
 BUSINESS: Television talk show 
</P>
<P>
 BOSS' NAME: Larry Sanders (Garry Shandling) 
</P>
<P>
 DUTIES: Spend a lot of time signing Larry's personally autographed photos; get 
quizzed by Larry on his monologues; cut Larry's breakfast melon in precisely 
two-inch squares, which he claims taste better. (Once they were cut too large 
and Hank had to maneuver the Heimlich on him.) 
</P>
<P>
 DRESS CODE: Donna Karan, on a J.C. Penney budget; lots of class with very 
little money. 
</P>
<P>
 PERFORMANCE REVIEW: Sassy, brassy, classy and motherly; spots out negative 
articles on Larry and hides them from him because he gets depressed; if he does 
see the articles, she sets him straight ("Get it together Larry, I'm not going 
to feel sorry for you"). 
</P>
<P>
 DELLA STREET FACTOR: Pretty darned high; does all traditional secretarial work 
and more; she wants to be referred to as an associate or assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 QUIRKS: Is always right behind Larry, often no more than five feet away; is a 
walking drug store; carries breath spray, Visine, month's supply of Excedrin.

<P>
 WORDS TO WORK BY: "Good show, Larry" and the occasional, "Great show, Larry" 
even though she never watches the show because of her preoccupation and concern 
about Larry. 
</P>
<P>
 PROMOTION QUOTIENT: Not much room for promotion; if she wants to be an actress 
she gets her annual national exposure when Larry brings her on-camera for her 
birthday, but announces her age to everyone and makes her feel old; she thinks 
she wants to be somewhere else, but is exactly where she needs to be. 
</P>
<P>

paperwork while checking out rookies; know every stop on the Metropolitan 
Transit as well as marital status of every detective. 
</P>
<P>
 DRESS CODE: First-floor Macy's, never basement; can of Aqua Net; O'Grady says 
of Donna: "The bigger her earrings, the fewer her lines. Small earrings equate 
with good work." 
</P>
<P>
 PERFORMANCE REVIEW: Overheard at the precinct: "Donna's the best at what she 
does and looks damn good doing it." 
</P>
<P>

while fixing minor office emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 QUIRKS: New York Ranger fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
 WORDS TO WORK BY: "So many men, so many wives." 
</P>
<P>
 PROMOTION QUOTIENT: If Donna doesn't go the archaic route of leaving when she 
marries, she'll have to learn to shoot a gun and get a detective badge -- or 
she'll be replaced by a computer. 
</P>
<P>

she can type 180 words-per-minute while applying mascara; keep her away from 
the toner.

 DELLA STREET FACTOR: Not much; has a charming smile but would never use that 
hair spray; thinks legal stuff is real boring. 
</P>
<P>
 QUIRKS: She's the Post-It note queen of the Miami Herald; her notes can be 
found everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 WORDS TO WORK BY: In her constant obsession to give Dave ideas she offers such 
observations as: "Why did the dumb blond stare at the orange-juice carton? 
Because the label said concentrate. Andy Rooney would pay big for that." 
</P>
<P>
 PROMOTION QUOTIENT: To the top with a bullet. Mia says she hopes to be the 
female Dave Barry or the female Barbara Walters. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 ACTRESS: Elaine Miles of "Northern Exposure" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BOSS' NAME: Dr. Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow) 
</P>
<P>
 DUTIES: Answer the phones; run errands; help with some medical exams; file; 
always listen to Joel's conversations; always know what's going on before he 
does; offer briefly worded, philosophical but quite reasonable commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 DRESS CODE: Doesn't have one; wears what she wants; fondness for Native 
American blanket-coats. 
</P>
<P>
 PERFORMANCE REVIEW: Takes messages, but sometimes won't give them to Joel if 
she doesn't think they're important; knits; writes in her journal; neglects 
duties for her writing interest. 
</P>
<P>
 DELLA STREET FACTOR: Very low; there's no typewriter in the office, but she 
takes fast notes; occasionally does transcripts -- with commentary; gets coffee 
infrequently for Joel, only when he asks for it and then delivers it with the 
standard, "Yeah, OK." 
</P>
<P>
 QUIRKS: Can fix engines and almost anything else; always makes patients take 
numbers even if there's only one person in the waiting room; can speak French 
and play classical Russian music on the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 WORDS TO WORK BY: "You have a call on Line 1." (There is only one line in the 
office.) "You don't have any appointments." (Knowing this makes the workaholic 
Joel nuts.) 
</P>
<P>
 PROMOTION QUOTIENT: Higher than one would think. Once cured everyone of a 
weird flu. Despite Joel's opposition, her Native American moose-poop paste 
worked better than his traditional cures. She has, on several occasions, taken 
over the office. Despite her proven curative powers, she has also considered 
firefighting. ** WANTED: SECRETARY ** 
</P>
<P>

PROFILE; SERIOUS BUSINESS; REBECCA DE MORNAY PLAYS THE OPPOSITE OF GLAMOUR IN 
ABC'S 'GETTING OUT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before she went to Atlanta to makes her latest film, "Getting Out," Rebecca De 
Mornay recalls seeing a woman standing aimlessly on a Los Angeles street 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really dirty and down and out," says De Mornay, who came to fame 11 
years ago in "Risky Business" as a sophisticated call girl who seduces naive 
Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was holding an infant, standing on the street, not begging, just sort of 
standing. You saw she obviously had nowhere to go and she wasn't asking for 
anything. I thought, 'Who speaks for these people?' " 
</P>
<P>
 De Mornay feels "Getting Out," which premieres Monday on ABC, does speak for 
those who "have no voice in our society -- the marginal, shadowy figures you 
kind of hope go away. It's very emotional for me to watch the movie because 
it's really (about) these people. I do care about them. I think there's a lot 
of people who do care about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Eugene Corr and Ruth Shapiro, "Getting Out" is based on Pulitzer 
Prize winner Marsha Norman's acclaimed 1977 play of the same name. The gritty 
drama finds De Mornay as Arlene (Arlie) Holsclaw, an uneducated, young Georgia 
woman who has been rehabilitated and released from prison after serving time 
for theft and murder convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene finds it rough going in the outside world, as she desperately tries to 
put her previous life behind. Her mother (Ellen Burstyn) is cruel and abusive. 
Her ex-con pimp boyfriend (Rob Knepper) wants her to return to the world's 
oldest profession. To make matters worse, the son Arlene gave birth to in 
prison was put up for adoption by her mother. Arlene can't bear the pain when 
she's informed she has no legal rights to her son and will violate her parole 
if she tries to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
 De Mornay decided not to read Norman's play. "I didn't want to know what they 
changed," she says. "I wanted to play exactly what was in the script. I could 
feel enough of Marsha Norman in the dialogue. I didn't want to beat myself and 
scream at everybody and say, 'You got to put this back in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they could have put anything back in. The movie came in at nearly two 
hours, "so they cut about a half-hour out. This character was basically in 
every scene, so they cut a half-hour out of my character." 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old actress laughs: "That's what I hate!" 
</P>
<P>
 De Mornay says she worked hard to get a specific look for Arlene, one far 
removed from her coolly glamorous turns in "Risky Business," "The Hand That 
Rocks the Cradle" and "Guilty As Sin." 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of look haggard in it," De Mornay says, sipping on a soft drink in her 
publicist's Beverly Hills office. "I didn't want to have a svelte body for it. 
I thought it would be wrong. I didn't do anything huge. I didn't want it to be 
about, 'Look. Rebecca De Mornay really gained weight.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But she did gain 10 pounds by eating cheeseburgers and French fries. She also 
changed her reddish-blond hair to a mousy brown. "I didn't wear any makeup in 
it except for a few scenes." 
</P>
<P>
 De Mornay also made sure she perfected her Southern accent before filming 
began. "I worked on it by myself. That was very important because I could never 
be thinking about the accent. It had to be totally second nature and that 
worked pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the film was made in 20 days, De Mornay didn't have time to rehearse. 
"It was boom, we were shooting," she says. "I didn't even get to meet Ellen 
Burstyn until the last week when we shooting all of her stuff." 
</P>

 Director John Korty ("The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman") is pleased with 
De Mornay's work in the film. "I think she needs a lot of support as she goes 
along," he explains. Before Korty began the project, he screened all of his 
leading lady's films. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some good work there," Korty says. "But even in 'Runaway Train' 
with Jon Voight, she had a role that was a strong role, but very limited 
dynamics. She was kind of two or three notes. The same with the other stuff. In 
'Hand That Rocks the Cradlee' she had a certain amount of range, but somehow 
you knew early on this woman was up to no good. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I thought about our film I said, 'This is going to be from A to Z, 
because she moves from one extreme to another.' I think she realized while we 
went along that this role is really stretching her in not just one or two 
dimensions, but all over the place. She got really involved in it. I had heard 
from other people she could be difficult to work with. I've worked with several 
people other people said were difficult, and I usually get along with them. I 
usually can get a very interesting performance and I think that we did that." 
</P>
<P>
 De Mornay says she's struggled long and hard to be taken seriously as an 
actress. But in retrospect, she doesn't know if fighting for it was worth it. 
"People turn around and say, 'You are stupid because people won't be able to 
pigeonhole you. Therefore, it was harder to make you a product, an identifiable 
project, so you would be a bigger star.' But I really wasn't thinking like 
that. I really wanted to be an actress. So I did my acting, my growing and my 
experimenting in public -- which I guess I'm still doing."

 WHAT THEY FOUGHT FOR: 1861-1865 by James M. McPherson (Louisiana State 
University Press: $16.95; 88 pp.). A Union soldier wrote following the issuance 
of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862 that "as god gives us liberty we 
Should try to impart it to others . . . thank god the chanes will Soon be 
bursted."It's an eloquent statement of a view held by many Northern soldiers -- 
but by no means all, for others believed Lincoln's order had turned the civil 
conflict, as one put it, into "nothing but an abolition war." "What They Fought 
For" is essentially a work-in-progress, an essay surveying some of the themes 
James McPherson (author of the 1989 Pulitzer winner "Battle Cry of Freedom") 
plans to explore in greater detail in a forthcoming history, but this volume 
stands on its own due to the many strong voices it contains -- those of James 
M. McPherson and those of the soldiers he quotes. McPherson's reading of 
thousand of letters and diary entries have led him to dispute the common belief 
that Civil War soldiers didn't know why they were fighting, and to conclude 
that although slavery was indeed a central issue, Confederate and Union 
combatants alike believed themselves to be "custodians of the legacy of 1776." 
It's appalling to read Southern soldiers' references to battling "tyrants" on 
behalf of "liberty" while suggesting a few sentences later that their families 
purchase more slaves, but equally inspiring to learn of the English-born Union 
corporal explaining his re-enlistment in a letter home by writing "if Liberty 
should be crushed here, what hope would there be for the cause of Human 
Progress anywhere else?"

 THE SOCIAL ART: Language and its Uses by Ronald Macaulay (Oxford University 
Press: $25; 241 pp.). Why do some people get so worked up about misspelling? 
Thorstein Veblen's explanation: because English orthography, being "archaic, 
cumbrous, and ineffective" and requiring much struggle to learn, is mastered 
primarily by people hoping to be considered "knowledgeable."That's just one of 
the many language tidbits to be found in this book, which covers 
once-over-lightly just about every aspect of language you can imagine. Ronald 
Macaulay, a professor at Claremont's Pitzer College, has based "The Social Art" 
on decades of teaching introductory linguistics, and it shows, for both good 
and ill; many chapters are thin, only four or five pages long, but contain 
consummate, usually amusing examples of the topic at hand. Macaulay breaks no 
ground here, but he's a good synthesizer, citing interesting research, for 
example, on gender (men tend to speak "firmly" or "bluntly" in novels, women 
"quietly" or "innocently"), ordinary discourse ("you know" and "I mean" have 
been found to be "effective means of making conversation coherent"), and 
language formation. The one enthralling chapter in "The Social Art" is that on 
children's language, which contains the following skip-rope rhyme, recorded by 
Macaulay in Scotland in 1978: "When the war is over/Hitler shall be dead/he 
wants to go to heaven/with a crown upon his head/but the Lord says/'No/you have 
to go below/cause there's only room for Elvis/king of rock and roll."

 What I can't believe is that a quality show like "Thea" (ABC), which 
exemplifies a positive black family that everyone can enjoy, is yanked off the 
air for "Home Improvement" reruns and an idiotic, stereotypical "South Central" 
(Fox) appears to further humiliate African Americans. The language is crude and 
the jokes are trite and it offends me as a South Central Angeleno.

 THE PROMISE OF PRAGMATISM: Modernism and the Crisis of Knowledge and Authority 
by John Patrick Diggins (University of Chicago Press: $29.95; 529 pp.). 
Pragmatism, the one branch of philosophy native to the U.S., has never been 
easy to define; it was born with an emphasis on scientific positivism, remained 
skeptical of objective truth in the realm of ideas, and after dwindling away 
following World War II has recently been revived through the "neo-pragmatism" 
of Richard Rorty and his followers. In "The Promise of Pragmatism," City 
University of New York professor John Patrick Diggins gives us pragmatism in 
all its permutations and conflicts, as seen through the work of its principal 
exponents, among them Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey and of 
course Rorty. The book tends to be heavy sledding, despite the clarity of 
Diggins' prose, for although the author teaches history, his emphasis is on 
philosophy and the often specialized disagreements among its practitioners. 
It's a welcome relief, consequently, whenever Henry Adams appears on the scene, 
for Diggins uses the intellectual frustrations of this turn-of-the-century 
writer (and self-described "conservative Christian anarchist") to voice the 
sort of philosophical and spiritual problems pragmatism hoped to solve. Diggins 
knows his material backward and forwards, and productively pits dissimilar 
philosophers against one another in a form of historical "hopscotch," but the 
lay reader will appreciate this book mostly for what he can pick up by osmosis. 
Case in point: Santayana's thumbnail description of pragmatism, which Diggins 
paraphrases as bearing the message that it's "better to pursue truth than to 
possess it."

 THE OLD MODERNS: Essays on Literature and Theory by Denis Donoghue (Alfred A. 
Knopf: $27.50; 288 pp.). Denis Donoghue writes in the final essay in this 
collection that literary historians are "like war correspondents who are 
irritable when nothing much is happening"; they like revolution, change, 
movement, controversy.Donoghue, a professor of English at New York University, 
isn't completely immune to such things, but in "The Old Moderns" -- as the 
oxymoronic title implies -- he is certainly the voice of established tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Donoghue's readings are occasionally so close they'll put the reader to sleep, 
but on the first-rank moderns -- notably Henry James and W.B. Yeats -- he 
writes compellingly. Of particular interest is the essay on James' "The Golden 
Bowl," where Donoghue uses William James, Henry's philosopher brother, to point 
up the frustrations caused by the novelist's later work. William, in a letter 
to Henry upon reading "The Golden Bowl," wryly asks Henry if his brother can't 
"sit down and write a new book, with no twilight or mustiness in the plot, with 
great vigor and decisiveness in the action, no fencing in the dialogue, no 
psychological commentaries, and absolute straightness in the style? Publish it 
in my name, I will acknowledge it, and give you half the proceeds."

ON VIEW; A DEAR TALE; CBS MOVIE STICKS TO THE RAW EMOTION IN KINNAN RAWLINGS' 
'THE YEARLING' 
</P>

 Most producers would be too intimidated to remake classic movies for TV. Not 
Robert Halmi Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year his RHI Productions has reincarnated "Gypsy" and "Call of the 
Wild." And he's currently in production on 'Scarlett," the eight-hour CBS 
miniseries based on the sequel to one of the most beloved films ever made, 
"Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very arrogant," he states matter-of-factly. "I think I can do better. It 
doesn't deter me that a picture was done whenever and by whom. The biggest 
arrogance in my life is to do 'Scarlett.' I can do it better, I think, not 
because I am smarter, but with today's technologies I can do things that the 
movie makers 30 years ago didn't have the tools to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Halmi believes his latest production, "The Yearling," premiering Sunday on 
CBS, surpasses the 1946 Oscar-winning picture that starred Gregory Peck, Jane 
Wyman and Claude Jarman Jr. Halmi also is executive producer of Monday night's 
ABC movie "Getting Out." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible, physically, what you can do," says Halmi, who is in 
pre-production on Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe" and Rudyard Kipling's 
"Captains Courageous." 
</P>
<P>
 "The film (stock) is better, the colors are better. We can do things today 
that make (movies) a little bit more watchable and more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Yearling" is based on Majorie Kinnan Rawlings' 1938 Pulitzer 
Prize-winning coming-of-age novel about a boy and his pet deer, Flag. Wil 
Horneff ("The Sandlot") stars as young Jody Baxter, who lives with his loving 
father Penny (Peter Strauss) and his bitter mother, Ora (Jean Smart), on a farm 
on the edge of the northern Florida swamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Life is hard for the Baxters, who barely can make ends meet among the oak 
moss. Because Jody's older brothers and sisters all died in infancy, Ora is 
afraid to love her surviving son and her husband. Without friends his own age, 
Jody and his father form a powerful bond, and it's Penny who allows Jody to 
have an orphaned fawn as a pet. Ultimately, the relationship between Jody and 
Flag brings the boy into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 The film was shot last winter in Charleston, N.C. "We found just the right 
swamp and the right look," says Halmi, who also produced "The Josephine Baker 
Story," "The Incident" and "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge." He also insisted the actors 
speak the original dialect used in the book. "It just gives it another richness 
to it. The movies that were done in the past, they never used these things. 
They were adaptations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing the book," Halmi explains. "That's the major difference between 
the movies of the '30s and '40s and today. Take 'Gypsy.' Not one word, not one 
moment was different than the original Broadway show. It's important that you 
don't change it. In the past, you read the book, it stirred you and then you 
redid the book. You took this incredible liberty of arrogance and changed the 
words. Those words are the real treasures. To ignore that is not only 
ignorance, but stupidity. All of a sudden you stop becoming a literate person 
and you become a fake." 
</P>
<P>
 The Emmy Award-winning Strauss also wanted to be true to the book. When he 
agreed to play Penny, the actor reread "The Yearling," which, he says, 
"stunned" him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That book is read like 'King Lear' and 'Great Expectations,' when we are too 
young to really understand them," he says. "It was one the most magnificent 
books I had ever read in terms of language, in terms of dealing with the 
father's loneliness and the mother's fear of loving. (I thought) it would be 
wonderful to make this film in a manner that a family can sit down and see big 
values brought to life." 
</P>
<P>
 The original movie, Strauss believes, doesn't work today "because it's overly 
sentimental. For it to be vibrant and alive and rich for an audience today, it 
has to be a little tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Strauss wanted to emphasize the loneliness Penny suffered. "It's very 
interesting that Marjorie Rawlings writes Penny Baxter's childhood in one line, 
saying that he had a dreadful childhood and he had come to this place to heal. 
I said to myself, 'Wow.' He was the son of a preacher and he talks throughout 
the book about loneliness and when this boy finally comes into his life, he is 
just so attached to him. He wants the love of this woman and she has just shut 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Yearling" was a very tough shoot, Strauss says. "It was very complicated 
to work with animals. We had complicated weather conditions. The film, like 
most films, is 'Gee, we want to make this movie and we want it tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even one of the most poignant moments, Strauss says, was a nightmare to film. 
Pay close attention to the sequence where Penny, recovering from a rattlesnake 
bite, is lying in bed next to the fawn and petting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you about that scene," Strauss says, laughing. "First of all, I 
was covered in banana puree because the deer didn't want to stay in bed. Deer 
know they don't belong in bed. Then they tried putting an apple inside my 
armpit so that the deer would stay there. Deer butt their heads when they 
nurse, and I was getting nursed. I had three hoof marks across my chest when 
the deer wanted to get up. After 30 minutes, this deer was more exhausted than 
the rest of us and it started to go to sleep. I had been a human salt block. 
This deer licked my face raw because of the banana puree!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Yearling" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

 THE FORTY FATHOM BANK: A Novella by Les Galloway (Chronicle Books: $10.95; 108 
pp.). Les Galloway, for many years a commercial fisherman harboring in Los 
Angeles and San Francisco, died in 1990 at the age of 78, six years after 
having written this novella.Although Galloway had published a handful of 
stories in literary magazines and even Esquire, "Forty Fathom Bank " was issued 
privately in 1984 -- no doubt because commercial book publishers find novellas 
problematic, especially novellas as old-fashioned as this one. "Old-fashioned" 
is a compliment when applied to this work, however, because you could easily 
mistake "Forty Fathom Bank" for top-rank Jack London or B. Traven -- stories 
driven by compulsion and mystery, in which adventure transforms into avarice 
and worse. The narrator, a wealthy San Franciscan, looks back on his fateful 
decision to buy a boat many years earlier, when he hoped to set his family free 
from his insecure job in the real-estate business by starting a sport-fishing 
operation. The narrator's rash choice suddenly becomes brilliant, and he hires 
an eccentric but experienced fisherman to be first mate -- who asks for a 
peculiar fee arrangement, and suggests fishing for shark far from the other 
boats. A terrible thing happens, naturally, while the two men are at sea, and 
the reader may well be able to guess what it is, as the one flaw in "The Forty 
Fathom Bank" is its portentousness. All things considered, though, the book is 
a gem, for the story reeks of inevitability, enhanced in no small measure by 
Galloway's precise, lucid descriptions of commercial fishing.

 RUNS, HITS, AND AN ERA: The Pacific Coast League, 1903-58 by Paul J. Zingg and 
Mark D. Medeiros (University of Illinois Press: $19.95, paper; 170 pp.) I have 
yet to make it through a baseball season without harking back to the teams that 
thrilled me as a kid -- teams that no longer exist, from a league whose 
geography later defied its name, populated by players now relegated to cult 
mythology. There was Suitcase Simpson, travelin' man who reached San Diego via 
the old "Negro circuits," and Hollywood's Lucky Lohrke, who earned his nickname 
by missing a deadly bus trip, and Stout Steve Bilko, who bashed 148 home runs 
in three years to become the biggest man in Los Angeles, literally and 
figuratively. Oh, what a time that was, in the best minor league that ever 
existed, the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 My only regret is that I was on hand for less than the last decade of its 
Golden Age. But "Runs, Hits, and an Era" does more than make up for the 
inconvenience of my birth date. Lashed together in conjunction with an exhibit 
currently running at the Oakland Museum, it commemorates a league that should 
be remembered as far more than the spawning ground for future Hall of Famers 
Joe Di Maggio and Ted Williams. With vintage pictures and workmanlike prose, 
this evocative little book traces the PCL from its beginnings in 1903 -- one 
team was the Santa Cruz Beachcombers, another the San Jose Prune Pickers -- and 
it ends with the Dodgers and Giants bringing the big leagues west in '58. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the distended aberration that embraced Little Rock and Oklahoma City in 
the seasons that followed. This is the legitimate article here, a Coast League 
that has Angels in L.A.'s Wrigley Field and Stars in Hollywood's Gilmore Field, 
a Coast League in which Fatty Arbuckle, the scandal-plagued movie comedian, 
owned a rival team and rival trolley companies built a ballpark in Portland so 
they would have one more place to bring the public. If you weren't around when 
Casey Stengel of the Oakland Oaks and Lefty O'Doul of the San Francisco Seals 
matched managerial wits, you'll wish you had been. And Lord, what players -- 
Buzz Arlett and Jigger Statz, Tony Freitas and Truck Eagen and Frank 
Shellenback. Sluggers, spitballers and speed merchants. Shades from a past that 
we never knew as well as "Hits, Runs, and an Era" helps us know it now. John 
Schulian

 Isn't it a shame that on the holiest day of the year for Christians (Easter), 
we wanted to watch the traditional movie on ABC, "The Ten Commandments," and it 
was ruined by all the commercials? Seems to me that someone has values in the 
wrong place when you see the New Year's Day Rose Parade without commercials.

 ZIPPER! An Exploration in Novelty by Robert Friedel (W.W. Norton: $23; 256 
pp.). The headline of the brief, undated news story, which seems to have run in 
a New Jersey newspaper sometime around 1907, reads "Joy! Bliss! Beatitude! 
Self-Hooking Waist Found."The casual reader might assume from the foregoing 
that the lowly zipper, to which the article refers, was about to take the 
country by storm, but that wasn't the case; the first, rudimentary "slide 
fastener" had in fact been patented more than a decade earlier, and it would be 
another 30 years before the device became a permanent part of the cultural 
landscape. Robert Friedel, historian of technology at the University of 
Maryland, here recounts the zipper's rise to prominence, and it's a fascinating 
story largely because the ascent was so slow and uncertain. For years the 
zipper was produced by just one small company, today known as Talon, which was 
much more adept at manufacturing than marketing; in some early years most of 
the company's profits were produced by a single salesman (the famous, in some 
circles, Willie Wear), and until the 1930s the zipper was sold primarily to 
manufacturers. By the late 1930s, the fashion world's resistance to zippers was 
overcome and the burgeoning, now-competitive industry was selling more than 100 
million zippers annually "Zipper!" celebrates a wonderful bit of Americana, to 
be sure, but it's a serious work of history as well, Friedel using the zipper 
to illustrate the complex network of relationships among businessmen, 
inventors, salesmen and customers essential to making a novel product 
commercially successful.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1984 Purple Hearts (KCOP Sunday at 5 p.m.) seems a deliberate, if pale, 
carbon copy of "An Officer and a Gentleman." This is an old-fashioned, 
all-stops-out romance between a Marine Corps doctor (Ken Wahl) and a Navy nurse 
(Cheryl Ladd), played out against the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-time popular The Sound of Music (NBC Sunday at 8 p.m.), a 1965 
blockbuster, winner of five Oscars and from the final Rodgers and Hammerstein 
musical, stars, of course, Julie Andrews in the story of the Trapp Family 
Singers, who fled their home in the Austrian Alps just before the outbreak of 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad that so much of the 1985 Target (KTLA Sunday at 8 p.m.) is a 
conventional spy thriller with high-speed chases, because at its heart it is an 
honest father-and-son estrangement drama that comes to a boil when the father 
(Gene Hackman), a Dallas businessman, resumes secret agentry after 20 years. 
Matt Dillon plays the son. 
</P>
<P>
 Pale Rider (ABC Sunday at 8:30 p.m.) is Clint Eastwood's 1985 variation on 
"Shane," a pleasant enough diversion but marred by the queasy development that 
finds a pretty teen-ager (Sydney Penny) trying to seduce Eastwood's grizzled 
Stranger, who's come out of nowhere to help some gold prospectors in their 
fight with a ruthless hydraulic mining company. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fire and Rain (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.), there's little of either quality. 
The mediocre 1989 cable movie is about the crash of Delta Airlines Flight 191 
at Dallas-Fort Worth on Aug. 2, 1985. Angie Dickinson plays a nurse and Charles 
Haid and Dean Jones play rescue workers, but in a sense they're victims, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story (NBC Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a 1990 TV 
bio-pic about the author of the children's book that inspired the 1939 film 
classic "The Wizard of Oz," is long on mush and short on magic. John Ritter 
plays the title role as a one-dimensional bobo of such unfaltering goodness 
that he makes Mister Rogers look like the Marquis de Sade. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 Double Impact (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 6 p.m.) offers 
two Jean-Claude Van Dammes for the price of one, and for fans of the 
Belgian-born martial arts star, it delivers the goods. It's a fast-moving 
action-adventure set largely in Hong Kong, where in 1966 a couple of bad guys 
assassinated a British entrepreneur and his wife, but the twin sons survive -- 
separately, of course. They meet as adults who join forces in avenging their 
parents' death. Van Damme does well in playing two sharply defined and distinct 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Enforcer (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.), Clint Eastwood's third and often 
humorous "Dirty Harry" movie that was made in 1976, tracks down an elusive 
terrorist group. To Harry's dismay, he has a new partner -- none other than 
Tyne Daly, later of "Cagney and Lacey."

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; BARNEY'S PURPLE PASSION FOR 
HAPPINESS HITS THE PRIME-TIME HOURS ON NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If there are any grown-ups who have somehow not discovered Barney & Friends -- 
led by that blissful, colorful dinosaur -- at its usual morning slots on PBS, 
they can catch up with the dino's antics in a prime-time special on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In his hourlong network debut on NBC, Bedtime With Barney: Imagination Island, 
the Purple One takes his kiddie friends on an adventure to an island where they 
meet an eccentric toy inventor who learns the joy of sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the key theme interwoven throughout this special -- sharing," says 
executive producer Dennis DeShazer, who has been associated with Barney creator 
Sheryl Leach since the birth of the friendly dinosaur. "He's really designed 
for family viewing and it's a nice fit" in prime time, DeShazer adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining Barney's popularity -- which has confounded many adults -- the 
Texas-based DeShazer says, "The youngest of children can understand that Barney 
is for them . He's a friend who likes to sing and play and use his imagination, 
the way children do. He's a security blanket for preschoolers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barney concept came about when Leach (then a marketing executive with the 
Lyons Group, which now produces "Barney") felt that there really wasn't much on 
TV to interest her 2-year-old son. Originally conceived as a teddy bear, Barney 
became a dinosaur after her son became smitten with a dinosaur exhibit that was 
visiting their hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to prime time is only the latest evolution in the marketing of 
Barney, which began as a three-part video, then became a PBS show, Radio City 
Music Hall concerts and a radio show in 40 markets. Barney now gets 10,000 
letters a week and boasts a million-member fan club, DeShazer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bedtime With Barney: Imagination Island" airs 7-8 p.m. Sunday on NBC. "Barney 
& Friends" airs weekdays at 7-7:30 a.m. on KCET and KLCS, 9-9:30 a.m. on KVCR 
and 10:30-11 a.m. on KPBS; Saturdays and Sundays at 6-7 a.m. on KPBS; Saturdays 
at 8-9 a.m. on KCET and 5:30 p.m. on KLCS. For ages 18 months to 5. Another 
Family Show 
</P>
<P>
 There's a gun. A fight ensues. Shots ring out and connect with flesh. Rewind. 
Same scenario, same fight, but no gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids Killing Kids, a prime-time special airing -- without commercials -- 
simultaneously on CBS and Fox, examines alternative outcomes in four dramas. 
The first scenario in each segment includes a gun; the second doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenarios: A young man carries a gun to school hoping to impress a girl; a 
young man tries to protect his younger brother from the neighborhood gang; a 
depressed teen has easy access to a gun; and a promising teen, fearing for his 
safety, brings a gun to school. 
</P>
<P>
 When the stories are replayed, methods to counter or replace violence with 
peer intervention and suicide hotlines are examined. Also illustrated are how 
violence and its tragic aftermath can be avoided, and ways that conflict can be 
resolved peacefully and safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids Killing Kids" originally was intended as a "CBS Schoolbreak Special," 
according to executive producer Arnold Shapiro. "This show doesn't preach or 
talk about laws or pitting police against citizens," he says. "It's a vivid 
portrayal of the same situation with and without a gun, where injury and/or 
death is the consequence of the story with the gun, and life and a peaceful 
resolution are the outcome in the version without the gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the special's intended audience, Shapiro says, "Teen-agers don't really 
appreciate consequences, which are a hard thing to teach, but if a weapon is 
physically unavailable to them, they can't wreak the havoc." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 minutes of the 60 minutes that would have been reserved for 
commercials, Shapiro added the documentary short Kids Saving Kids, which looks 
at ways peers can help one another stop the cycle of random violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids Killing Kids" airs Tuesday at 8-9 p.m. on CBS and Fox. For ages 7 and 
up.

MOYERS: THE STORY AND THE PHOTOGRAPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks for publishing the article on Bill Moyers ("Bill Moyers Acts Up," by 
Marshall Blonsky, March 27). What's the matter with me that I've enjoyed his 
books and tapes so much? And constantly pondered his interviews? And felt my 
life so broadened and enriched by his work? 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't you print such an article years ago and spare me all of the above? 
</P>

<P>
 I can't believe that you allowed Moyers to be photographed in such a grotesque 
way. Imagine, forcing us to look up his nose and at his double chin, with his 
hair looking like a metal helmet surrounded by ghoulish silhouettes. On many 
occasions over the past five years, the magazine's photography has upset me, 
but this time you have gone too far.

 Although I applaud Mark P. Petracca's letter (March 27) arguing that the 
contributions of some public administrators have been undervalued -- such as 
Henry Cisneros as HUD secretary ("The Reluctant Warrior," by Marcelo Rodriguez, 
Feb. 27) -- former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is not a prime example of 
a capable politician who chose not to seek the office of President. As a 
naturalized American citizen, Kissinger is constitutionally disqualified to 
hold the nation's highest office.

<P>
 Adding to the thoughts of Prof. Petracca: Two Republican Presidents, Warren G. 
Harding and Herbert Hoover, are never bragged about by those attending GOP 
conventions. While I, an octogenarian, agree that Harding should never have 
been nominated, Hoover had the talent and experience to be an outstanding 
President. Here was this great mining engineer, respected around the world for 
his business savvy and his management of global relief efforts after World War 
I and later as an innovative secretary of Commerce -- all appointed positions. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hoover was an "abysmal" President, it was a lack of experience in elective 
office that did him in -- that and the misfortune to have his term coincide 
with the start of the Great Depression. If he had been through the ordeal of an 
election for governor -- even if he had lost -- he undoubtedly would have been 
a more understanding leader.

ON TARGET -- MOSTLY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations for the article "Fighting for the Soul of Brazil" (by John 
Powers, March 27). Having as its main focus the presidential candidacy of Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva, the article was an excellent analysis of the 
consolidation of democracy in Brazil. It confirms the strength of democratic 
values in my country in that all Brazilians, including those of working-class 
origins, have an opportunity to influence the nation's future. In how many 
other countries would it be possible to succeed in the "personal odyssey" 
described by Powers that has brought Lula "from a peasant's shack to the 
threshold of the presidential palace"? And in how many other countries can 
voters take pride in the fact that their political future is not being 
determined by the power of money? 
</P>
<P>
 Some absurd characterizations of Brazil disappointed me, though. Powers called 
Brazil "psychotic" and "permanently on the verge of a nervous breakdown." He 
also writes that there was an "almost-demented quality" to the 1989 
presidential campaign, claiming that Brazilian voters were "filled with a sense 
of inferiority." 
</P>
<P>
 Another matter: Children are not "routinely murdered" in the streets of Rio de 
Janeiro. The murder of children in Brazil is anything but "routine." These are 
crimes that have shocked Brazilian society and have received the full attention 
of and action from government authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is a poor country with many social problems, but as Powers indicated, 
Brazilian society has learned that the only way to solve them is through the 
use of democratic institutions. Democracies are in the long run far more stable 
and efficient in securing sustained economic development and a high standard of 
living for its citizens. This is currently being proven by Brazil's democratic 
free-market economy. Powers' emphasis on this point outweighs in importance the 
minor inaccuracies referred to above.

<P>
 Upon my return recently from a week in Sao Paulo, I realized that Brazil was 
as much of a mystery to me as it was before my visit. Granted, one week is 
hardly enough time to get to know any place, especially where a language 
barrier exists, but in Sao Paulo I felt that I had encountered a vast city that 
either had no soul to expose or more soul than I could comprehend. It left me 
puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to Powers' revealing feature on Brazilian politics and candidate 
Lula, a lot of pieces fell into place. Reading about Lula's battles against his 
country's political and cultural elite strengthened my understanding of the 
causes behind Brazil's rampant poverty and the seemingly irreversible decline 
and decay that I witnessed during my visit.

THE MARRIAGE OF MAO AND STALIN; UNCERTAIN PARTNERS: STALIN, MAO, AND THE KOREAN 
WAR, BY SERGI N. GONCHAROV, JOHN W. LEWIS AND XUE LITAL (STANFORD UNIVERSITY 
PRESS: $45; 393 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jane Hamilton-Merritt, Jane Hamilton-Merritt's Tragic Mountains: The Hmong, 
The Americans, and the Secret Wars for Laos 1942-1992, was a 1993 finalist for 
the Los Angeles Book Prize in History.

 Two of the most tantalizing mysteries still remaining after glasnost are the 
closeness of the Sino-Soviet alliance that followed World War II and the 
origins of the decision to start the Korean War. "Uncertain Partners" offers a 
number of chilling and important revelations about both. 
</P>
<P>
 Illuminating the intrigue, manipulation and paranoia of Russia's Josef Stalin, 
China's Mao Zedong and North Korea's Kim Il Sung, "Uncertain Partners" depicts 
the arm-twisting that led North Korea to invade South Korea and outlines the 
dimensions of Russia and China's volatile, decade-long alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors -- Sergei Goncharov is a senior adviser to Boris Yeltsin; John 
Lewis, a professor of Chinese politics at Stanford; and Xue Litai, a research 
associate at Stanford -- wrote this book ("a child of discovery") after mining 
Soviet archives and the Hoover's Institution's East Asian Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Their sketches of Mao and Stalin portray flawed and sometimes petty leaders, 
ensnared by past experience and ruthless and conniving in pursuing foreign 
policy goals. Mao's principles in dealing with Moscow and Washington were the 
ancient ones of "playing one barbarian off against the other," the authors 
write, and of "uniting and dividing by political manipulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Following World War II, Mao was faced with no small dilemma: the need for 
total victory in the civil war in China; the need to reunify and rebuild China 
after the conclusion of the civil war; and the need to align China with one of 
the two world blocks -- the Soviet Union or the U.S. These he had to accomplish 
without compromising too much sovereignty or becoming a satellite to the new 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalin, on the other hand, focused on national security. Fixated on "the 
coming confrontation between communism and capitalism, the inevitable Third 
World War that would deliver the death blow to world imperialism," Stalin, the 
authors write, wanted to control the timing of the confrontation. He had to 
walk a fine line to complete his Asian agenda without going to war with the 
U.S. in Asia. To do so, he needed to maintain the fiction of non-involvement in 
Asian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Stalin, the battlefield would be in Europe, but he "needed to control 
Mao's relations with the Americans; only then could Mao's power be employed 
against the United States and coordinated with Soviet actions. In addition, 
Stalin needed to ensure that the Soviet bufferzone in China would be 
preserved." 
</P>
<P>
 The writers argue that Mao allied with Stalin to seek national security, while 
Stalin turned to Mao in order to get a "safety belt" to counter the U.S. 
encirclement he thought was imminent. The necessity to isolate China from the 
U.S. drove Stalin's alliance with Mao Zedong. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Korean War fit into the national interests of China and the Soviet 
Union? 
</P>
<P>
 The authors make it clear that the Soviets were "firmly in the saddle" in 
North Korea with Kim Il Sung installed as the national leader and with "Soviet 
Koreans" -- those educated and trained in Russia -- in positions of military 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that the Chinese, with obvious interest in neighboring North Korea, 
were in no position to vie with the Soviet Union for influence because China 
was consumed with its civil war. Thus, the authors conclude, the North Korean 
invasion of South Korea on June 25, 1950 "was pre-planned, blessed, and 
directly assisted by Stalin and his generals, and reluctantly backed by Mao at 
Stalin's insistence." (Mao was reluctant in part because he intended to use his 
military to invade Taiwan.) 
</P>
<P>
 Stalin, hoping to avoid a Soviet-American confrontation in Korea, wished to 
stay in the background. He "determined that the way to do this was to implicate 
Mao in the decision and thereby make him bear the full burden for ensuring 
Kim's survival if the Americans intervened." 
</P>
<P>
 With Mao's armies -- called the Chinese People's Volunteers -- committed in 
the fight in Korea, his plan to invade Taiwan evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 A fuller portrait of the birth and demise of the Sino-Soviet alliance and of 
the origins of the Korean War -- still shadowed by secrecy and intrigue -- is 
likely to emerge as more Soviet archives open and as former Soviet, Chinese, 
and Korean officials go public with their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, we benefit greatly from this uniquely multinational study of 
an alliance that incited brutal combat in Korea through what the authors 
rightly call "reckless war-making of the worst kind."

SYMPATHY FOR THE QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Letter writer John Derevlany of Venice (March 27), though he was out of town 
during the Jan. 17 earthquake, has the gall to berate quake victims for 
continuing to "yammer" about their losses. To him, all I can say is, "You had 
to have been here, Jack." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everyone is interested in the welfare of these disaster victims 
during this difficult time. These unfortunate people should be encouraged to 
take as long as they need to grieve and to work out their terrors with the 
knowledge that most of us who were not hit are rooting for them. We know it's 
just a matter of time until it's our turn. We hope we'll also be entitled to a 
bit more compassion than Derevlany could muster. 
</P>
<P>
 What a shame that the misery of others seemed to be messing up his day.

<P>
 Derevlany must not be aware that sharing these traumatic personal stories 
helps to relieve the tremendous stress and anxiety that so many earthquake 
victims feel. If all he can do is wish that everyone would get on with his or 
her life, perhaps he should get one.

CRIMINAL PURSUITS

<P>
 "Didst thou think the war was over? 'Tis not; it goes on as before," an Army 
buddy of mine once wrote in an otherwise ribald poem. So it seems. The Cold War 
has a postnasal drip. Authors ingeniously find new changes to work on Us v. 
Them -- changes which even find justification in the news, as with the recent 
Ames spy case. 
</P>
<P>
 What needs to be said about James Grady's THUNDER (Warner Books: $21.95; 380 
pp.) is that never was an indifferently written book so suspensefully 
entertaining. Grady, who wrote "Six Days of the Condor" and was once an 
investigative legman for columnist Jack Anderson, evidently knows the fiercely 
competing Washington intelligence bureaucracies like the back of his hand, with 
which he gives them a goodly swipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The time is now; a huge bomb has gutted a New York skyscraper. The longtime 
CIA partner of Jack Lang is killed by a seemingly stray bullet as they drive to 
work. Lang is now tamely doing liaison work between the agency and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 A worse than burnt-out case, Lang spends much of the book in a dazed state, 
represented by an italicized stream of consciousness that resembles rough 
drafts of cables. ( "Easy. Go easy with her." ) But no matter. Grady has a tale 
to tell and he gets on with it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no stray bullets in crime fiction, except as conveniences during the 
finale. Lang's partner was on to something, confiding in no one and wiped out 
before he learned more or told anybody. Did what he knew relate to the bombing? 
Lang's explorations keep leading to victims of a villain who got there first. 
Lang is soon a target himself. There are erotic interludes, which seem like 
ritual dances in the marketplace, engendering no heat at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the bad guys (including a shrewd killer Lang refers to as Wet-boy) 
close in, Grady, as he did in "Six Days," generates a large amount of what-next 
suspense. 
</P>
<P>
 The denouement confirms anybody's dark fears about the consequences of all the 
secrecy in the intelligence establishment. As Pogo classically remarked, the 
enemy is us, although Grady appears to be glad that the CIA is on our side. The 
phrase from many a book jacket still lives: The novel is soon to be a major 
motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Sebastian's LAST RIGHTS (Morrow: $22; 280 pp.) involves something of the 
same kind of internal convulsions, this time on Their side. Amid the chaotic 
crumblings of the Soviet government, an archivist has fled the country with a 
trove of secret documents identifying key men in several governments, including 
the U.S. and the Soviet Union itself, for conspiring to keep the Cold War hot, 
to the greater benefit of the armaments industry worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is Russia and London, where the defector has surfaced long enough to 
be murdered, his body found in a car belonging to the Russian-born mother of 
the first-person narrator, Edward Bell. His mother, who had done gulag time as 
a dissident before escaping to England, has disappeared. Bell himself is shot 
and wounded. Searching for Mama and the purloined documents propel the story, 
and do they ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Sebastian, a BBC correspondent in Moscow at the time of the dissolution, was 
expelled as a spy (a charge denied), and he captures Moscow past and present 
with high authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of telling a complicated story in the first person -- the past and 
present both interwoven and notably complicated -- was daunting, and Sebastian 
carries it off with a flair. Mama sounds like a Slavic version of Ruth Gordon 
in "Harold and Maude," crafty, outrageous and devious, and Sebastian gets 
inside Bell and makes him a fully-realized individual. A recommended adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hill has a doctorate and has been a carpenter and taught karate. He 
lives in Southern California and writes a private-eye series not quite like any 
other, in its seasonings of intellectual reference and its obeisances to 
Kerouac and other folk heroes of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 In SHOOT THE PIPER (St. Martin's: $18.95; 196 pp.), Randall Gatsby Sierra, his 
low-energy protagonist, takes off for England in pursuit of one of his literary 
idols, Jack MacLeod, a dissolute charmer whose reputation rests on a single 
novel called "Road Hog." MacLeod has vanished with a huge advance and what is 
thought to be the only copy of a new novel. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase, amusing, punctuated by a succession of bright eccentrics and 
leading to Wordsworth country in the Lake District, finds MacLeod keeping one 
jump ahead, leaving clues to his next stop and tales (legends in the making) of 
his bizarre, alcohol-fueled capers. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod addresses the Oxford Union ("Dear fellow decadent spoiled brats") in a 
set piece, weird but not entirely idiotic, that confirms Hill's intentions to 
use the private-eye form as a carrier for personal plays of spirit. The 
intentions are entirely welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida coasts, the Keys this time, continue to generate the steamy 
fictional excitement that once seemed a Southern California exclusive. In MEAN 
HIGH TIDE (Delacorte: $24; 371 pp.) James W. Hall's protagonist is again Thorn, 
who only wants to be left alone to fish and dive and enjoy his lady love. But 
she dies -- murdered underwater while diving for lobster. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for the why leads to a madman breeding a rare fish which, endlessly 
multiplying, could feed the world or, of course, be the death of all the other 
fish in the sea. The madman's seemingly captive daughter keeps seducing men to 
kill her father, but he keeps killing them first. The villain of Hall's piece 
is no great mystery but the sense of time, place and character is great, the 
complications fascinating and the scaly Grand Guignol finale both improbable 
and pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Barr, a National Park ranger whose debut "Track of the Cat," was a fine 
and atmospheric thriller about a woman ranger in peril in the Texas heat, 
relocates her Anna Pigeon on Lake Superior in A SUPERIOR DEATH (Putnam: $19.95; 
303 pp.).  
</P>
<P>
 Storm-tossed on that dangerous lake in darkness in dank, chill weather, Pigeon 
yearns for a little unbearable Texas heat. Barr's command of the milieu -- the 
environment, the rough camaraderie of the rangers on their isolated island 
stations, bracketed by tourists on one hand, local fishermen and boat operators 
on the other -- is stronger than the plot, involving treasure in the form of 
ancient wine and more deaths by diving, but a freshness of place is no bad 
thing. Barr (now stationed in Mississippi), builds to a vivid finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Ely, one of the many former movie Tarzans and later an emcee of the "Miss 
America" pageant, has produced a competent if not quite ground-breaking first 
novel, NIGHT SHADOWS (Simon & Schuster: $20; 319 pp.). He is working Ross 
Macdonald country -- Santa Barbara, where Ely lives, by its own name. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake Sands retires to a very pricey gated community to recover emotionally 
from the loss of wife and child, murdered in some as-yet unwritten previous 
caper. He finds a dying man outside his unit but tries to stay clear of any 
involvement; he's had enough in his anti-terrorist work. But the community's 
hard-nosed security chief, let alone a nasty local cop, won't leave him alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the premise and the premises are strewn with bodies, gangland links are 
disclosed, and the condo is in need of retrofitting with an equally solvent but 
better class of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida again, Miami this time, is the setting for the Arthur F. Nehrbass 
novel, DEAD HEAT (Dutton: $19.95, 327 pp.). (His first was "Dead Easy.") It's 
mob family time again, and the old don has dispatched Vincent Strollo, 
enforcer, loan shark and all-round success story, to early retirement in 
Florida because he's become too interesting to grand juries and congressional 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to keep a bad man down, and Strollo is soon wallet-deep in 
scams, the largest involving construction of a high-rise, which seems to be a 
skein of skimmings and loans backed by fake bearer bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The good guy is the colorless head of the local FBI office, who is having to 
contend with a couple of murderous rogue agents as well as keep an eye on 
Strollo's moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Nehrbass sets all this up very efficiently. The reader has been there before 
but presumably had no objections and won't this time. The recruiting of 
debt-ridden or greedily ambitious patsies, the erection of the scams, the nice 
wife and the trusting cousins betrayed, the dames seduced by danger, and 
finally the family ties tightening garrote-like around Strollo's neck -- all 
swift and readable. 
</P>
<P>
 The ending resembles a Shakespearean all-points slaughter, with no courtier 
around to ask a blessing or sing the blues. Expert if impersonal, all the way 
through.

A PALATE REVOLT IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County owes a heavy debt of gratitude to S. Irene Virbila for her 
review of Pascal in Newport Beach ("Comme Ci, Comme Ca," March 27). Not only 
has Orange County been emancipated from Los Angeles, it's also enjoying its own 
culinary identity, independent of the Westside L.A. sense of worldly 
self-importance. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only hope that Virbila's mean-spirited review will stifle any 
compulsion on the part of the hordes of elite L.A. palates to journey 
southward. Pascal, one of the restaurant jewels in Southern California, was a 
hit long before her critique. Many thanks for your contribution to its 
preservation. 
</P>

<P>
 Someone needs to remind Virbila that Times Mirror Square is not the center of 
the universe. Not all of us are an hour and a half from Newport Beach. Nor do 
we want restaurants to be judged by how long Virbila has to drive. The 
magazine's previous reviewer three times included Pascal in her list of 
Southern California's Top 40 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 My guests and I have found it to be excellent on every visit. It seems as 
though the long drive made Virbila grumpy and spoiled her appetite. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I also enjoy going out of my way for a good meal. I don't know what part of 
Los Angeles Virbila came from, or at what time of day she drove to get to 
Pascal, but I do know that I can get from my house in Newport Beach to Pino 
Bistro in Studio City in an hour and five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 I find that I agree with the parts of her report that deal with the service 
and decor of Pascal. Her opinions on the food, however, seem a bit cavalier. 
Like the comment that the "risotto managed to be both mushy and undercooked." 
In my experience, it would have to be one or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how good a restaurant is, a critique like this tends to make a 
restaurateur sit up and consider what's being done right and what can be 
changed for the better. So the review is, in a way, one of the most useful 
Pascal has ever received; every business needs a wake-up call once in a while.

 THE NEW WORLD ORDER IN DRAWING AND SCULPTURE 1983-1993 by Pat Oliphant 
(Andrews & McMeel: $12.95; 94 pp., illustrated, paperback original). The 
program from a touring exhibit, "Order" proves that Oliphant remains one of the 
wittiest and most influential contemporary political cartoonists. His mordantly 
funny drawings depict a reunited Germany as Frankenstein's monster, stitched 
back together, and unemployed Russians and Americans arguing whether Gorbachev 
or Bush is less able, in a game of one-downsmanship. The sculpted caricatures, 
which are really just three-dimensional drawings, seem less interesting than 
the vivid pen and brush works.

THREE ON THE TOWN: THE TWILIGHT ZONE; WHEN THE STARS COME OUT AT NIGHT IN 
CALIFORNIA, THAT'LL BE THE DAY

 Just what kind of party can the Academy Awards ever be when right here in Los 
Angeles -- Oscar's native time zone -- the show is over before your average 
8-year-old's bedtime? 
</P>
<P>
 For the big finish, there stands Steven Spielberg, holding his double Oskars 
like golden barbells, and it's still practically daylight outside. If he 
hurries, he can probably get the tux back to the rental shop for the one-day 
discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar night is just one more instance of West Coast humiliation, of the bowing 
and scraping we do to Eastern Standard Time. The Greeks sent sacrificial 
virgins to the Minotaur. The U.S. government handed over protection money to 
the Barbary pirates. And we pay our colonial tribute by screwing up our body 
clocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood -- our Hollywood, the cynosure of the world, an industry that 
abandoned New York to come west -- puts on its grandest fete at an hour that's 
too early even for a first date. 
</P>
<P>
 Shed no tears for actors and actresses dragooned into sequins and black tie at 
2 p.m. Shed them instead for hometown fans. As the curtains rise on Oscar, New 
York guys named Vinnie are already ensconced on the La-Z-Boy -- while L.A. guys 
are struggling home from work on the Artesia Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 All this to accommodate the East Coast and New York, a city that, if 
restricted to its own entertainment, would have to get by with Woody Allen, 
Stephen Sondheim and Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet/phone/fax/satellite age has mandated one national circadian rhythm: 
Manhattan's. (Washington, D.C., is only along for the ride.) And just as the 
tiny island of England once ruled a fifth of the world, the tiny island of 
Manhattan tyrannizes us: 
</P>
<P>
 It makes California brokers rise just as rave parties are winding down so they 
can be at work in time to answer a Pavlovian bell that rings 3,000 miles away 
in the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 It forces wee-small-hours stars such as Jay and Arsenio to tape their 
"late-night shows" on a matinee schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 It rousts West Coast notables and pundits at 3 a.m. to look fabulous or sound 
brilliant, live, for East Coast morning shows. (So obliging of us to have our 
big quake during New York morning drivetime.) 
</P>
<P>
 It puts nubby wool in the display windows of department stores in August, just 
as the weather here gets miserably hot. (If it's sweater weather in New York, 
then by God it's sweater weather everywhere.) 
</P>
<P>
 And would the U.S. Postal Service, which recently misidentified a Western 
rodeo star on a stamp, have committed such an error in the "Mafiosi of Long 
Island" commemorative series? 
</P>
<P>
 The last time I was in New York, everyone I met asked me what people in 
California thought about Amy and Joey. This was about two years ago, and I had 
never heard of Amy and Joey. (Would that that were still true.) The New Yorkers 
were flabbergasted that everyone on "The Coast" -- a quaint term, like "the 
outback" -- wasn't enthralled by the cheesy couplings of a teen-ager in need of 
a curfew and an adult male in need of electrolysis. California crimes are so 
much more engrossing, and make far better TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
 About three decades ago, an enterprising reporter of my acquaintance asked 
Gov. Pat Brown, a third-generation Californian, whether the Golden State would 
ever overtake New York in national precedence. No, he said, not so long as the 
Big Apple had the time zone advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring Fresno Mean Time, or the likelier possibility that the Earth's 
magnetic poles will reverse sometime in the coming millenium, the sun will 
continue to rise in Eastern Standard Time. The only way to reverse 
Atlanti-centrism: Move Congress and Wall Street here. 
</P>
<P>
 May I see a show of hands? . . . I thought not.

 SEX, DEATH AND GOD IN L.A. edited by David Reid (UC Press: $13.; 383 pp.). 
Ethnically, geographically and economically diverse, Los Angeles is a 
singularly difficult city to characterize, as the eclectic and uneven essays in 
this anthology demonstrate.Mike Davis offers a revealing look at the "rust 
belt" of the city, where heavy industry flourished only a few years ago. Ruben 
Martinez captures the mood of contemporary L.A. when he describes his journal 
as "an attempt to gather together the strewn shards of my identity scattered 
like beads of broken glass across the Golden State Freeway. . . ." Alexander 
Cockburn and David Reid strive for illuminating turns of phrase, but the reader 
is more aware of effort expended than the result; Carolyn See strains to 
portray her divorces as a metaphor for the shifting ethnic balance of the city. 
The fictionalized peeks inside the film business are just silly: In L.A., truth 
is stranger than docudrama.

 THE KING OF CARDS by Robert Ward (Washington Square: $10; 324 pp.) . Ward's 
coming-of-age story has a rambunctious energy that is difficult to resist. When 
narrator/novelist Tom Fallon returns to his alma mater to receive an honorary 
doctorate, he recalls the tumultuous mid-'60s, and how he came under the spell 
of the improbable, charismatic Jeremy Raines and his "completely 
self-indulgent, wildly crazy, and yet deeply humanistic" entourage. A good 
editor might have curbed Ward's taste for scatological humor; like Jeremy, the 
results are simultaneously engaging and frustrating.

 HOW TO SPOT AN OWL by Patricia & Clay Sutton (Chapters: $14.95; 143 pp., 
paperback original). In this upbeat guide, the Suttons remove some of the aura 
of mystery from owls, explaining why the birds fly silently and how the 
flattened facial disc reflects sound to the sensitive ears (an owl can hear a 
mouse moving under several inches of snow). Although many of the tips on 
observing these intriguing predators seem directed at East Coast residents, 
Southern Californians could adapt them to watch the local great horned, Western 
screech and barn owls.

LOVE IN THE TRENCHES; CONJUGAL BLISS: A COMEDY OF THE MARTIAL ARTS, BY JOHN 
NICHOLS (HENRY HOLT: $22.50; 304 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Carlson, Ron Carlson is the author most recently of the story 
collection, Plan B for the Middle Class. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Nichols' new novel bears the fortunate subtitle, "A Comedy of the Martial 
Arts" (with a transposition mark in "Martial" between the "t" and the "i"), and 
this wordplay is a kind of truth in advertising for this novel is a broad 
marital comedy and it is full of the kind of play and sense of humor that we 
know is the often the true sense in his work. Nichols, who has treated politics 
and the environment and the obvious ironies of our social order with his 
ebullient, sometimes zany wit in his other novels, takes on marriage here, 
specifically the ill-fated matrimonial tempest of Roger and Zelda. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger, a moderately successful science fiction writer, was moderately happy in 
his laid back bachelorhood. He had a series of lovers, (longstanding 
relationships really), an ex wife, a dog, two grown children, a gang of 
friends, a resident spider (Big Al), a book and screen contract, in other 
words, a life. He's a nice guy who actually tells us he thinks life is a bowl 
of cherries. Into this bowl comes Zelda, a woman we come to see who has no 
particular propinquity to moderation. Her physical attributes -- which are 
catalogued at every opportunity in this rambunctious, episodic story (and which 
are frequently accompanied by stimulating footwear) -- seem to be the 
libidinous manager that unmoor lusty Roger, leading him to abandon his carefree 
days and enter the wholly agitated state of matrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, of course, there is honeymoon, a bonding of cosmic proportions that 
bodes a life of productive, trusting bliss if not sex, with short breaks to 
work on his writing. His current Sidney Bard thriller "Perseid Meteor Thugs" is 
well under way. With his blessing, Zelda move into his house and starts her own 
novel. Their days are spent writing, loving, not in that order, and then eating 
hors d'oeuvres and having libations in the early evening the way we were meant 
to in the garden of Eden, here a small town in what we imagine might be New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Then things begin to shift. She cleans his house. Big Al bites the dust. An 
irreverent photograph of his children comes down. Up goes her credo written on 
a napkin and framed: "I always win." Roger has as his most salient 
characteristic, after his relish of all things sexual, an easy-going 
generosity. He doesn't care about winning: He cares about keeping the peace and 
fostering the opportunity for sexual congress. He rolls with the punches. And a 
great deal of this novel chronicles her punches and his rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelda notes, "I'm like Pancho Villa. . . . I'm fearless, I never learned how 
to retreat. I was born to attack." The attacks concern: the mail, his former 
lovers, his ex-wife, nomenclature for sexual congress, the hypothetical 
if-I-die argument, a balloon ride, table manners and the children. Roger seems 
blindsided by each, dumbstruck, certainly struck, and he tries (oh how he 
tries) to accommodate his charming wife's demands. The skirmishes escalate as 
does the wear and tear on Roger. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these battles are broadly comic, some assume more heft. Roger's former 
lover Gretel is dying of cancer, and Zelda's jealously seems beyond 
understanding. Many moments test our patience with Roger and his great 
willingness to bend over backward when Zelda is clearly in the wrong. Roger 
drops his old friends, changes his customs and even denounces his own children 
to avoid her wrath. He falls impossibly behind on his book. There's a funny 
argument when he offers Zelda the compliment of being his muse and she takes 
offense that she might have inspired the dreck he writes! The big tip off on 
Zelda for me came when she practiced mime in the garden, her face painted white 
with two big red dots on her cheeks. That's over the top for anybody anywhere. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The writing itself in this novel (which Nichols calls a "sleazy piece of 
fiction" in the dedication) most reminds us of Roger's behavior: it feels 
profligate. Roger himself is "known in some circles as the Speedie Gonzales of 
sci-fi." A few of his friends call it "the blam method of writing." I'm not 
sure if Nichols used the blam method for "Conjugal Bliss," but there are times 
when he seems to be writing with a grin, having more fun than we are. At other 
times, splashes of this book are reminiscent of the quirky juxtapositions of 
Richard Brautigan. Consider this coupling: "Then Zelda climbed all over me like 
Joe DiMaggio on his 56-game hitting streak, delightfully immortal and 
unstoppable." And later these two one-line paragraphs: "I could kiss Zelda the 
way raindrops cling to a leaf" and "I could touch her intimate places like 
Michelangelo's 'Pieta.' " Four friends witness them fight "like monkeys 
watching the atomic bombing of their own private banana plantation." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols also gives us Zelda's friend, the nutty Weezy Bednarik, who spies on 
Roger constantly but only communicates through a parrot hand puppet (which 
comes to a timely end) and Roger's ungainly son Woody, a "dysfunctional Yeti" 
who resembles Sid Vicious playing "Quasimodo down on his luck." Nichols also 
has a romp with the synopses of Zelda's "novel" an outlandish tale of 
melodrama, sex, and mayhem, which Roger can't resist peeking into. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conjugal Bliss" is a larger-than-life anti-romance, antic and full of 
low-jinx; imagine "Othello" by the writers of "I Love Lucy." Even after Rogers 
comes to and realizes which way is up, (we hope) Nichols is not above pulling 
(or trying) a joke on the reader. John Nichols is to be celebrated as a 
grinning trickster with this wry roman a clef ??? a book rich in the humor and 
energy of caricature.

 ANGELS IN AMERICA: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes, Part Two: Perestroika by 
Tony Kushner (Theatre Communications Group: $10.95; 158 pp., paperback 
original) and SHARING THE DELIRIUM: Second Generation AIDS Plays and 
Performances edited by Therese Jones (Heinemen: $16.95; 342 pp., paperback 
original). The second part of Kushner's Pulitzer Prize-winning play derives 
much of its extraordinary power from the author's ability to juxtapose broad 
comedy with genuine pathos.Nebbishy Prior Walter's reaction to his encounter 
with the angel ("I'm exploring my dark side these days, I'm losing myself in 
some ideological leather bar") sounds as credible as the Angel's grim prophecy 
of "Death more plenteous than all Heaven has tears to mourn it." The shorter, 
less polished works in "Delirium" represent workshop efforts by authors who are 
still learning to approach serious issues without belaboring the audience. The 
most effective piece in the collection is Doug Holsclaw's darkly funny "The 
Baddest of Boys," set in a San Francisco cafe where the employees keep dropping 
dead -- one waiter has called in dead four times in a single month. There are 
flashes of inspiration in Tim Miller's "My Queer Body" and Micheal Kearns' 
"Myron, a Fairy Tale in Black and White," but the authors' words don't come 
alive on the page as Kushner's do.

 THE BEST OF FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT edited by Geoff Spink (I.B. Tauris/St. 
Martin's Press: $15.95; 292 pp., paperback original). These transcripts of the 
twice-weekly BBC broadcasts cover a wide range of topics: victims of nuclear 
testing in Siberia; political disaffection in Iran; ethnic violence in Sri 
Lanka, India and the former Yugoslavia. In a report on President Clinton's 
national health insurance plan, Gavin Esler describes American health care as, 
"a Kafka-esque bureaucracy, delivering to millions of Americans Third World 
standards at superpower prices with all the compassion of the KGB." Concise, 
intelligent and informative, these reports stand as a reproach to the 
superficiality of American network news.

PALM LATITUDES: HOMEFRONT; THE REAL REAL ESTATE GAME

 Pity poor Herschel Elkins. As state senior assistant attorney general, he's 
got a lot of important stuff to worry about but he keeps having to investigate 
California homeowners who want to raffle off their homes like prizes at a 
pancake dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since a couple in Maine sold an inn by hawking tickets last year, dozens 
of Californians have tried to do the same. But there are countless problems 
with such schemes, says Elkins, including the fact that they're usually illegal 
and they don't work. So far, of the 50-plus contests Elkins knows about, not 
one has raised enough cash, so the contests are simply abandoned. "People 
foolish enough to buy tickets are often forced to wait many months to get back 
their money," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery laws require "money-for-prizes" contests to be based on skill, not 
luck, so many of the contests involve essays or other subjective competitions 
judged by the seller. In addition, Elkins says, many sellers misrepresent their 
home's value. 
</P>
<P>
 Elkins recently won stipulated judgments against two homeowners who ran 
illegal contests. Now he's watching a contest run by Studio City entertainment 
lawyer Steven Roth, who is selling tickets for his home in the Hollywood Hills. 
The ticket-holder who correctly answers a series of trivia questions will win 
the house. However, he wants 7,000 ticket buyers at $75 a pop to raise 
$560,000, a tidy profit over the $389,000 he paid in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth says that if he can't raise $560,000, he will award three-fourths of the 
cash to the contest winner, keeping one-fourth -- and the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth says he is "an expert on contest law and the attorney general's office 
has reviewed (my contest) and decided to take no action against it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's news to Elkins. "I won't decide upon any action until after his contest 
is over. He'll just have to take his chances." Jill Stewart

 In Japan, the fish vendor is a familiar sight, presiding over a stall at a 
marketplace or delivering his wares door to door. In Southern California, 
however, the closest most of us get to fish is pointing at a hunk of orange 
roughy through the glass at the local supermarket.But the area's growing Asian 
population can still find touchstones in entrepreneurs like Ray Goto. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years, Goto, a second-generation Japanese American, has driven his 
truck from neighborhood to neighborhood in the San Gabriel Valley, Cerritos and 
Venice selling what many customers say is the freshest fish they've found, 
including tuna, salmon, yellowtail, halibut, Spanish mackerel, squid and 
octopus. He also offers vegetables and Japanese staples including tofu, rice, 
soy sauce, fish cake and noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goto offers more than just food; his visits create a sort of mobile market 
day. When his truck arrives in a neighborhood, Japanese moms, with babies and 
young children in tow, rush out to shop and talk to their neighbors. Children 
beg their moms to buy them treats, gum shaped like a whistle, maybe, or Pockys 
-- long, skinny cookies dipped in chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay and Paul Hashimoto, second- and third-generation Japanese Americans, enjoy 
Goto's pleasant personality and the convenience. But they say that what has 
kept them coming back every week for the past three decades is the freshness of 
Goto's fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fish has to be fresh," says Goto, who rises near dawn every day to stock 
up at the San Pedro docks. "Most of my customers eat it raw." Susan Carrier

REASON TO WEEP

 Having made your way through "Picasso and the Weeping Women,the critically 
acclaimed exhibition currently on view at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 
you'll arrive at a Picasso shop stocked with Picasso-related souvenirs and 
books. Exactly what is the function of the shop? To make money for the museum? 
To further educate the museum-goer on Picasso? What were the criteria used by 
the bookstore in selecting the 20 titles it stocks, out of the dozens of books 
in print on Picasso? 
</P>
<P>
 "The bookstore is one of the few ways the museum has to raise funds, so 
salability is a consideration as far as what we stock," says Marlene Kristoff, 
who oversees the museum stores. "But the primary function of both the main 
bookstore, and the auxiliary shops we sometimes install to accompany specific 
exhibitions, is as an educational facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Proof of Kristoff's words can be seen in the absence of "Picasso; Creator and 
Destroyer," by Arianna Stassinopoulos, a controversial Picasso biography that 
was lambasted by art scholars when it was published in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might consider stocking a book with little academic credibility if there 
was a shortage of titles on an artist, but obviously that wasn't the case with 
Picasso," says Kristoff, who's been at LACMA since 1985 (prior to that she was 
a buyer for Gump's Department Store in San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 "We made our selections for the Picasso shop based on the suggested reading 
listed in the back of the exhibition catalogue by the curator and catalogue 
essayists," adds Kristoff, "and we're also stocking books on Picasso that we've 
previously carried in the museum store." 
</P>
<P>
 The main bookstore, which carries roughly 1,500 titles, needn't be too picky 
about what it stocks, however, because there simply aren't that many art books 
published in a given year: associate book buyer Stephen Goff estimates that 
about 300 new art books come into print each year (if one includes exhibition 
catalogues, the number goes up to 500). 
</P>
<P>
 There are perennial bestsellers the store always keeps in stock -- H. W. 
Janson's ubiquitous textbook, "History of Art" is an example of that -- and 
Goff says the store also does consistently brisk sales in books on costumes and 
textiles (one assumes the movie industry accounts for a good deal of that). 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, bookstore stock tends to evolve to reflect changes in taste. 
Books on the Impressionists sold like wildfire in recent years, for instance, 
but the store is presently seeing a surge in interest in Gustav Klimt (this is 
mysterious, considering that there hasn't been an exhibition of Klimt 
hereabouts). 
</P>
<P>
 As to how the store screens the books it carries, Goff says no one actually 
sits down and reads them. Rather, he relies on information provided by 
publishers' catalogues, sales representatives and his own considerable 
knowledge of art writers. Goff left his job teaching art to come to LACMA 21 
years ago, and he's seen a lot of art books come and go in the intervening 
years. So, if you're inspired after an exhibit to take something of the 
artists's work home, something say, between a postcard and the real thing....

PALM LATITUDES: STATE OF MIND; L.A. STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean McDonald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As technology and culture conspire to reduce the spoken story to nothing more 
than books on tape for consumption in traffic jams, storytellers, professional 
and amateur, are fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least seven local pockets of resistance with a thousand scattered 
troops, but the oldest and largest single cadre is the West L.A.-based 
Community Storytellers.Once a month, members band together at a West L.A. 
synagogue in groups of 25 to 40 to swap stories -- stories about anything at 
all, from the personal to the mythological. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1981 by storytellers Peggy Prentice and Kathleen Zundell, the group 
has no official membership -- "We would rather be an organism than an 
organization," Zundell says -- but there are 390 people on its mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent evening, a meek-looking woman tells of her light-rail ride into 
Watts. An elderly man relates a stumbling but evocative story about being a 
role model for a delinquent youth. He is followed by a younger man whose long 
hair and black leather jacket complement his story about the spirit of rock 'n' 
roll. Another person begins a tale about a leprechaun and by the end he's 
almost perfected his brogue. Finally, an artist's story about the death of his 
best friend, his dog, inspires a purple-haired woman to describe the 
multigenerational journey of her grandfather's ashes, finally buried last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Storytelling, clearly, is no longer just for kids, though, as Zundell notes, 
"For many years, storytelling was kept alive by librarians during children's 
story hours." Sure, Zundell spins yarns for plenty of children's groups, but 
she also recounts goddess myths for women's groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The ancient art, she says, fills a basic need. "The more technological we 
become, the more we need storytelling -- to create something real, a tangible 
community." Sean McDonald

JUST KIDDING; RECYCLING 'THE PAPER' FOR THE TECHNO AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Howard's new movie, "The Paper," is an entertaining, breathlessly paced 
yarn about the old stalwarts of the Fourth Estate, but we'll let you in on a 
little secret: It's complete bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 A journalist's life is nowhere near that interesting. No one, for example, 
gets in fistfights over replating a page, and random gunfire in newsrooms is 
almost completely a thing of the past. Real reporters' jobs entail sitting for 
hours phoning sources who don't answer or return calls -- but put a couple of 
scenes like that in a script and see if an agent returns your calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that journalists weren't flattered by the celluloid attention, but there 
are plenty of more contemporary media outlets that could likewise make for 
riveting, cutting-edge Hollywood entertainment. Here's our list of adventures 
in the world of First Amendment high-technology. (In keeping with the precedent 
established by Howard's film, we've given each prospective movie a generic, 
uninvolving title, followed by a nominally more interesting and commercial 
title.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cyberzine" (a.k.a. "Dazed and Confusing")  
</P>
<P>
 Hotshot factoid compiler Binky Viscera (Bridget Fonda) finds her career 
blue-penciled when a gruff new managing editor, Isaiah Burnside (Sir Richard 
Attenborough), joins the trendy, attitude-laden publication and brings along 
his outmoded ideas that copy should be in the same size and typeface and in 
tidy columns and that the magazine's editorial content should actually be 
coherent and linear and distinguishable from advertisements. Complications 
ensue when a city road map designed in the magazine's graphic style hopelessly 
confuses motorists, creating a weeklong citywide traffic jam. Romance blossoms 
when Binky falls for Stan (Nicolas Cage), a dyslexic who can actually follow 
the magazine, and he encourages her to follow her dreams and compose even more 
disorienting copy. Co-starring Janeane Garofalo as Ricki, the magazine's 
wise-cracking, Doc-Martens-wearing art director. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Quickie Scandal Paperback" (a.k.a. "What's Integrity Got to Do With It")  
</P>
<P>
 Snotty, well-paid Cole Treacle (Tom Cruise), who makes big bucks churning out 
instant paperbacks on current scandalous news topics, finds his career in the 
remainder bin when his publisher hires Martha (Maggie Smith), a new editor who 
insists that he actually investigate stories in more depth than a simple Nexus 
system search. Meanwhile, Cole's best friend (Chris Elliott) tries to persuade 
him to pick up where he left off on his novel: "Dammit, man, you used to write 
fiction that soared with the rhetoric of Milton! Why do you sell yourself out?" 
Co-starring Janeane Garofalo as Sally, the publisher's wise-cracking, 
Doc-Martens-wearing cover designer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tabloid Newsmagazine" (a . k . a . "The Age of Ignorance")  
</P>
<P>
 Josh Varicator (James Spader), the hotshot stud journalist for a popular 
syndicated TV newsmagazine called "Deck Heads," finds his career hanging by a 
stringer when Judith (Judy Davis), a former print reporter, begins insisting 
that Josh's stories adhere to certain outmoded journalistic requirements, such 
as honesty. Complications arise when Josh and Judith share a furtive romantic 
moment, then each sues the other for sexual harassment. Meanwhile, Josh 
stumbles onto a genuinely important story involving a high-ranking politician's 
unethical use of arcane tax loopholes, but no one believes him. Co-starring 
Janeane Garofalo as Kathie, the program's wise-cracking, Doc-Martens-wearing 
set designer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CD-Rom Game" (a.k.a. "Reality Bytes")  
</P>
<P>
 Maverick game designer Roy Probate (Crispin Glover) sees the words "Game Over" 
flashing before his career when Esther Masters (Sally Kirkland) is hired as new 
vice president in charge of production, an old-school conservative whose 
philosophy allows no room for gratuitously violent imagery in the games. 
Complications arise when a bunch of kids in the Midwest discover a secret, 
unpublished move in one of Roy's games, "Who Embarrassed Roger Rabbit," which 
leads the player to a den of carnal activities not generally associated with 
children's video games, inspiring an irate parents group (led by Max von Sydow) 
to call for Roy's head. Meanwhile, romance blossoms when Roy falls for fellow 
techno-nerd Dottie (Carol Kane), who creates a way to compress every book ever 
published onto a single compact disc, thus eliminating the need for libraries 
throughout the world. Co-starring Janeane Garofalo as Leeza, the company's 
wise-cracking, Doc-Martens-wearing graphics designer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Corporate Newsletter" (a.k.a. "The Hudsucker Prose")  
</P>
<P>
 Beatrice Verdad (Winona Ryder), fresh out of journalism school and ready to 
take on the world in her first job churning out public-relations-quality copy 
for the house organ of a major mega-conglomerate heavily involved with toxic 
chemicals, finds herself in hot, possibly poisonous water when Arthur (Gene 
Hackman) -- a burned-out former newspaper editor still striving to deliver the 
truth -- insists that the newsletter feature hard-hitting reports on the tragic 
environmental ramifications of the company's profit-making ventures. Meanwhile, 
ruthless hit men hired by the corporation beat Arthur senseless, until he is 
rescued by a nature-loving, nunchuck-wielding environmental wacko named Kraven 
(Steven Seagal). Complications arise when romance blossoms -- Amy is torn 
between Arthur's gentle integrity and fatherly compassion and Kraven's unhinged 
propensity for violence. Co-starring Janeane Garofalo as Vicki, the 
wise-cracking, Doc-Martens-wearing art department flunky. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Information Superhighway" (a.k.a. "The Briefs Brief") Link Upshaw (Denzel 
Washington) is slated to become road kill when he discovers a memo from CEO 
Cain (John Malkovich) in corporate headquarters describing the Information 
Superhighway as an insidious plot to ossify the attention spans of humans 
everywhere by inundating them with so many superfluous, trivial sound bites so 
removed from any sort of context that people will become permanently addled, 
profoundly incapable of reading, reasoning or realizing they're becoming the 
Stepford Race. Romance blossoms when Link becomes involved with an attractive 
young woman (Julia Roberts) who provides him with further incriminating proof 
against the company, but it's not like he gets to kiss her or anything. 
Complications ensue when Upshaw gives the scoop to a big-city newspaper's 
managing editor (Glenn Close), but she declines to bother to replate the front 
page to get the story in the paper in a timely fashion. Co-starring Janeane 
Garofalo as Montel, the conglomerate's wise-cracking, Doc-Martens-wearing 
assassin.*

STYLE: DESIGN; BEDROCK'S NEWEST DIGS 
</P>

<P>
 It's unusual for an interior designer the stature of Eugenia (Bootsie) 
Feldspar to decorate a starter house, but Fred and Wilma Flintstone are not 
just any young couple. Wilma, daughter of the redoubtable Pearl Slaghoople, 
grew up in one of Bedrock's most formidable residences. "Mother never moved a 
candy dish without consulting Aunt Bootsie first," Wilma remembers. "So, 
naturally, when the issue of the bowling trophies came up, my first thought 
was: 'We'll let Aunt Bootsie decide.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It all began when Fred, a sportsman of considerable accomplishment, wanted to 
line the walls of the dining area with his glittering spoils of conquest at the 
lanes. Mother-in-law Slaghoople thought otherwise. "I was caught in the 
middle," Wilma shrugs, "but Aunt Bootsie was wonderful." Feldspar settled the 
bowling trophy brouhaha with an inspired compromise: Fred got to pick his 
favorite, which the designer then mixed with other objects in a still life so 
fetching that the offending trophy all but disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled in the hills surrounding Bedrock, the Flintstones' home on Cobblestone 
Lane is situated in a subdivision that, thanks to mature landscaping, has a 
been-there-forever look. Sadly, the identity of the original architect of their 
model has been lost, though ample evidence of his ingenuity lives on. Certain 
givens of the site -- for instance, a petrified Cro-Magnon man that would have 
been difficult to remove -- were incorporated into the design of the dwelling. 
(To this day, above the sink in the master bath, one hairy hand holds the 
toothbrushes, while the other grasps a glass.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt needed," Feldspar says, lowering her eyes modestly. "They had every 
dumb appliance money could buy, but their art collection was execrable. The one 
exception was a marvelous little Grant Wouldn't that had been given to them as 
a wedding gift." Feldspar built on that bright beginning by pressing the couple 
into purchasing a portfolio of antique cave drawings they could ill afford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we improved the art, their furniture suddenly looked rather 
off-the-rack," says Feldspar with a conspiratorial wink. "I know the most 
divine little chiseler who does inspired things with exotic stone, but Mr. 
Flintstone wouldn't hear of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got married, Wilma and her friend Betty, who's very artistic and a 
little way-out, picked out this stuff at Marshy Fields and charged it on the 
revolving account," Fred says somewhat defensively. "No way I'm heavin' it 
before it's paid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldspar sighs with resignation. Anyone who's been in the decorating game as 
long as she has is accustomed to this sort of knuckleheaded recalcitrance: "I 
realized then that, with this client even more than most, my job is to 
educate." MARILYN BETHANY

AS BIG AS ALL OUTDOORS; TWO PALMS, TWO BARS, ONE BANDSTAND, ACRES OF TABLES 
UNDER UMBRELLAS. AH, PASADENA! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Driving along Green Street toward Old Town Pasadena and Twin Palms, I knew 
only that the new restaurant counts Cindy and Kevin Costner and Michael 
Roberts, the genie behind Trumps, as three of the six partners. And that it is 
big. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrance, a gap in the whitewashed wall, leads into an astonishing space, 
an open-air tent-restaurant as large as a village square. Dozens of 
white-clothed tables sit beneath the canvas sky, with six, eight, 10 wicker 
armchairs drawn up around each. Candles gust in the breeze. On this night, 
strategically spaced heat lamps keep it comfortable enough to eat in the 
virtual outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center, two century-old majestic palm trees poke through the top of the 
tent, which retracts in fine weather. Fragrant potted plants and herbs -- 
flowering citrus, rosemary, thyme, mint -- are arranged at their feet. Two 
lively bars bracket either end of the vast space. Waiters rush by bearing 
bright, glazed platters. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner, chickens, pork loins and rib roasts turn on a spit over glowing 
hardwood logs. In the kitchen, hearty stews and braiseddishes simmer slowly in 
a Texas barbecue oven adapted for the purpose. The restaurant seats 375 people, 
and on a recent Saturday night, the kitchen fed 698 people, 200 of them 
walk-ins with no reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin Palms manages to capture the feeling of village festivals in southern 
France or Italy, when tables are set up in the square and the whole town turns 
out to feast on grilled sausage and polenta or a grand aioli. Celebrations 
where the wine flows freely and the food is simple and abundant. And after, 
there may be music and dancing.  
</P>
<P>
 On my first visit, the maitre d', wearing a topcoat that chilly evening, led 
us to the back, to a more traditional indoor space converted from an old 
stable. The two of us had a generous table for four (there are no cramped 
deuces here). The place was full, yet the service was warm and energetic. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, I ordered the brandade appetizer, wonderful salt cod whipped 
into fluffy mashed potatoes and served with jaunty toasts. When is the last 
time you've seen a $3 appetizer big enough to serve four? The grand ai oli is a 
satisfying platter of grilled vegetables -- zucchini, carrots, deep orange 
squash, onions and boiled waxy potatoes with a crock of ungentrified ai oli. 
Both our main courses, thick slices of nicely juicy roasted sage pork and the 
honey coriander duck, were definitely a deal at $11 and $13.50 respectively, 
with a nice potato gratin and an array of vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, the menu doesn't have great pretensions. The cooking, much of 
it done on the outdoor rotisserie and grill, is truly rustic. Real food at 
modest prices. 
</P>
<P>
 At Trumps, which closed in 1992, Roberts took his cooking right to the edge 
with daring combinations of ingredients and techniques. Here, he's gone back to 
his roots with the kind of straightforward food he learned to cook in France 
when he was just starting out. Contemporary restaurant fare is based largely on 
sauteed dishes, preparing bits of this and that to order. At Twin Palms, he's 
returned to a more 19th-Century idea: roasting joints of meat and simmering 
dishes slowly to develop flavor, a method that has almost disappeared from 
restaurant menus. Its very simplicity makes it tricky to pull off. Twin Palms 
is doing a creditable job much of the time, but it is still a restaurant in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there is a grilled burger. And there is a pizza, a thin-crusted version 
topped with sausage, leeks and mushrooms, which makes a fine appetizer. It 
seems silly, however, to make anchovies optional on the pissaladie re. This 
thick Provencal "pizza" is traditionally topped with onions, olives and 
anchovies, the latter as essential as bacon to a BLT. The garden vegetable soup 
is weak in flavor despite the dollop of pistou (similar to Italian pesto) 
stirred in at the last moment. A dense chickpea polenta was not enhanced by a 
smear of pungent Roquefort. The salad of duck confit with broccoli rabe and 
wilted escarole sounded irresistible, but the tangle of limp ingredients didn't 
look appetizing. And, unless I'd read it myself, I would never have recognized 
the stringy meat as confit, which is one of my favorite things on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 One night the best dish was a special of sturgeon (a fish that actually has 
some taste) in a lovely orange-saffron sauce. When you order lamb shanks, you 
get the whole thing, tender as butter and served with flageolet beans. I didn't 
mind the resistant texture of the beef shank braised in red wine but wished the 
beef itself had more flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 While we savored the round, yeast-raised babas and oranges in vanilla syrup 
and nibbled on a sugar cone and hazelnut ice cream, a reggae band picked up the 
beat at the bandstand. One by one, the cashier at the bar, waiters, diners 
lingering over their coffee, were all bobbing to the music. Several couples 
started dancing.And while we waited for our car, we couldn't resist doing a 
little bounce ourselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Twin Palms has managed to translate the festive feeling of a village square to 
an urban, Southern California setting. With a high-profile chef at the helm and 
real people's prices (the valet parking is more expensive than most of the 
appetizers), it's a new breed of restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 Twin Palms, 101 W. Green St . , Pasadena; (818) 577 - 2567. Open Monday 
through Saturday for lunch, daily for dinner and late night supper . Sunday 
brunch . Full bar. Valet parking. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, 
food only, $29-$63.

STAGE WATCH: LLOYD WEBBER: CLOSE CALL WAS OF PARAMOUNT INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're one of the Patti LuPone fans who's disappointed that she won't be in 
"Sunset Boulevard" when it opens next fall on Broadway, don't blame Andrew 
Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer/composer Lloyd Webber blames Paramount Pictures. That was the thrust 
of his comments in a recent interview in the London Evening Standard. "The 
whole decision was taken out of my hands," Lloyd Webber said. His own company 
"has only ever owned half" of the show. "The rest belongs largely to Paramount 
Pictures, who made the original movie . . . Paramount flatly refused to put up 
their half of (the $12-million Broadway budget) if Patti plays the lead. I can 
raise my $6 million but I can't raise theirs. And they want Glenn Close. It's 
as simple and as difficult as that." 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe this scenario, Paramount -- whose Cecil B. DeMille wouldn't 
hire Norma Desmond in the fictional story within "Sunset" -- also won't hire 
the woman who created her on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paramount disputes Lloyd Webber's version. "All creative decisions were 
made by Andrew Lloyd Webber," Paramount spokeswoman Cheryl Boone Isaacs told 
The Times. "Paramount had no conversations with him about casting. It was all 
in his court." 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OF "SUNSET": The audience for the evening performance of "Sunset 
Boulevard" on June 12 will get an extra attraction for no extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the show begins, the concurrent Tony Awards broadcast on CBS will cut 
away from New York to feature a live performance of "As If We Never Said 
Goodbye" from "Sunset," direct from Century City. After it's over, star Glenn 
Close will present a Tony -- which one isn't decided -- from the Shubert stage. 
Then the Tony telecast will switch back to New York, and "Sunset Boulevard" 
will go on as usual, from the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Although curtain time will remain at 7:30, the "Sunset" audience that night 
will be asked -- via ads and mailings -- to be seated no later than 7:15. No, 
you don't have to wear black tie. 
</P>
<P>
 During the post-TV performance, the cast will, natch, repeat "As If We Never 
Said Goodbye." Those words will never have been more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a live number from Los Angeles shows the true national scope of 
today's Broadway," said Cy Feuer, president of the Tony co-sponsoring League of 
American Theatres and Producers. This doesn't mean the awards themselves will 
have "a true national scope" -- "Sunset" won't be eligible for Tonys until next 
year, after it opens on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 BACK TO CBS: Michael Arabian, who brought a site-specific "Romeo and Juliet" 
to CBS Studio Center in Studio City last summer, will open another production 
there on May 20. But this one is a modern play, "The History of Shadows," to be 
presented solely within Stage 18 (home of the "Dave's World" TV series) rather 
than all over the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Befitting the venue, three actors from popular TV series -- Bernie Kopell of 
"Love Boat," William Christopher of "MASH" and Robert Mandan of "Soap" -- are 
in the cast. But this is material they never covered on "The Love Boat." It's 
about a young gay man interviewing older gay men about their years in the 
closet; Ron Lachman adapted Robert C. Reinhart's novel. Rear projection film 
sequences will supplement the live action. Arabian plans to seat 199 and is 
negotiating an Actors' Equity contract. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN BERNARDINO SHUFFLE: Earlier this year, San Bernardino Civic Light Opera 
postponed its spring season and asked its subscribers to donate their tickets 
to the restructuring effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the city of San Bernardino has agreed to buy back the theater's 
home, the California Theatre. Although details haven't been finalized, a cash 
infusion is expected. In the meantime, the company went ahead and did a 
"Nunsense" without an Actors' Equity contract and now expects to finish its 
spring season with "I Do! I Do!" and "Sophisticated Ladies," probably with 
Equity contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Equity was "extremely unhappy" about the non-union show, said an Equity 
official, "but now we're happy to see them coming back from the dead."*

ON THE RECORD: FIDDLERS: FLYING FINGERS, SMILING FACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paganini's D-major Violin Concerto has long been put down as the ultimate 
vehicle for virtuosity for its own sake: in effect, a long, mindless cadenza. 
And it can be rather awful in the wrong hands, the wrongest of which would be 
those that show you what hard work it all is. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it's a wonderful score when the protagonist can project his 
pleasure not only in leaping the hurdles but in showing that it's not all in 
one key, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The virtues of the concerto were positively made to glow by Itzhak Perlman in 
his EMI recording of some 20 years ago. And the magic is worked again now by a 
30-year-old Russian named Ilya Kaler (Naxos 550649). 
</P>
<P>
 Kaler's clear rejoicing in his own skills is part of the pleasure of what is, 
after all, hardly deep-think music. But this violinist is not blindly intent on 
showing you what he can do with Paganini's technical challenges. He is 
attentive as well to the wit and modest lyricism of the score, in which he has 
the estimable assistance of the American conductor Stephen Gunzenhauser, who 
leads an alert Polish National Radio Symphony (Katowice). 
</P>
<P>
 Here, as in the Chopin piano concertos, we tend to notice the orchestral 
contribution only if it is very good or very bad. In this instance, it's 
decidedly the former, with Gunzenhauser smartly maintaining momentum and 
capturing the Rossinian verve that is buried within the faceless orchestral 
continuo the accompaniment becomes in less caring hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaler is superbly adept at executing the flying spiccatos and multiple-stop 
hazards of the Concerto, but unlike many another young whiz, he doesn't slack 
off when it comes to shaping the little lyric phrases Paganini supplies for 
contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 The violinist's ability to spin the long line is of even greater value in the 
coupling, Paganini's Concerto in B minor, always overshadowed by the flashier 
work in D, despite the former's celebrated "Campanella" finale. 
</P>
<P>
 In sum, Kaler displays a compleat virtuoso arsenal here: rhythmic vitality, 
warmth of tone and sentiment and, of course, the ability to encompass the notes 
without strain -- all bolstered by the requisite dose of ego. 
</P>
<P>
 The already sufficiently attractive package, in excellent sonics, becomes an 
astonishing bargain to boot in view of Naxos' usual, laughably modest price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comparison with a legendary master was not Naxos' intention, and will, insofar 
as possible, be circumvented. Yet, it's not easy, given the arrival on the same 
day as Kaler's disc a collection of showpieces played by Jascha Heifetz (EMI 
64929, 2 CDs, mid- price). 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the often impatient, dismissive Heifetz of the latter stages of his 
great career, but the wonderfully intense and humane virtuoso of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 There's big, impressive stuff in the set: Beethoven's "Kreutzer" Sonata and 
the Franck Sonata, with Benno Moiseiwitsch and Artur Rubinstein, respectively, 
as Heifetz's keyboard partners. But that's not what the program is about. It's 
about the two dozen encore pieces, including the inevitable high-speed 
dazzlers, Bazzini's "Ronde des lutins," the Dinicu "Hora Staccato" and tasty 
tidbits by Wieniawski, Poulenc, Korngold, Moszkowski, Albeniz, et al. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The high-speed, flashy stuff is wonderful -- smilingly so. Even more 
impressive is the caressing warmth, the subtle rubatos, the expressive slides 
that mark the lyrical material, such as "An einsamer Quelle" of Richard 
Strauss, Dohnanyi's "Gypsy Andante" and "Roxana's Song" by Szymanowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain stylistic aspects of his playing may hardly be to the tastes of many 
of our younger violinists nor, for that matter, were they to the taste of the 
later, tougher Heifetz. 
</P>
<P>
 No one plays like the '30s Heifetz any longer, nor perhaps should anyone try 
to revive too many details of the past and a unique performer. But certainly 
Heifetz's rhythmic energy and unwavering engagement will never be out of style. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps artists such as Kaler, Maxim Vengerov and Julian Rachlin -- not 
coincidentally, all from the same part of the world -- are extending the gentle 
push back into the direction of what is heard in these treasurable reissues, a 
process begun by Itzhak Perlman at the start of his remarkable career.*

 Watts' main appeal, a virile, emotionally charged attack, is showcased here 
with equally potent sidemen: drummer Jack DeJohnette, pianist Mulgrew Miller 
and acoustic bassist Charles Fambrough. 
</P>
<P>
 The ploy works to a point as Watts powers his way through the title tune, John 
Coltrane's "Mr. Syms" and an upbeat "I Hear a Rhapsody" all driven by 
DeJohnette's tom-tom bombs and chattering snare.But the tenor man's need to be 
assertive can be distracting as his relentless phrasing dances on without a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeter Arturo Sandoval guests on a pair of tunes, and is just as 
insatiable. More reserved numbers -- Watts' "Inward Glance" and "Transparent 
Sea" -- give the saxophonist and the listener room to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). BILL KOHLHAASE

 HOT STUFF: As we near the one-third mark of 1994, Mariah Carey's "Music Box" 
stands as the year's biggest seller: approximately 1.4 million copies sold 
since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey is joined in the 1994 million-sales club by seven other albums, 
according to SoundScan, the sales monitoring firm that tallies the weekly 
charts for Billboard magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The other albums that have also sold 1 million copies since Jan. 1: Ace of 
Base's "The Sign," Toni Braxton's "Toni Braxton," Counting Crows' "August & 
Everything After," Celine Dion's "The Colour of My Love," Salt-N-Pepa's "Very 
Necessary" and Snoop Doggy Dogg's "DOGGY-STYLE." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Fine, chief executive officer of SoundScan, points out all the albums are 
holdovers from 1993 -- a fact that underscores the record industry's reluctance 
to release key albums early in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The assumption for years has been that after spending so much money on records 
during the holiday season, pop fans need time to get back into a buying mood. 
So record companies wait a while before coming out with their big blockbuster 
releases, with a heavy emphasis on spring and summer sales campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fine questions that theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our figures show that January, February and March aren't that much different, 
from a sales volume standpoint, than June, July and August," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it might make sense for a company to come out with some of its hot new 
albums in January or February and take advantage of the lack of new 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the true 1994 releases, Pink Floyd's "The Division Bell" could be the first 
to join the million-sales club. In just two weeks it is nearing the 750,000 
mark. Robert Hilburn

 FAGENOMETRY 101: Given that it took Donald Fagen more than a decade to follow 
up his first solo album with last year's "Kamakiriad," fans may be surprised to 
hear that the Steely Danner already has another new release out. 
</P>
<P>
 But be forewarned: Unless you have a working knowledge of diminished 11th 
chords and flatted thirds, you might want to approach this one with 
caution.Fagen's latest is a video titled "Playing, Writing and Arranging: 
Concepts for Jazz-Rock Piano," just released by Woodstock, N.Y.-based Homespun 
Tapes, which specializes in music instructional tapes.  
</P>
<P>
 Teamed with pianist Warren Bernhardt, Fagen uses such Dan tunes as "Josie" and 
"Chain Lightning" to demonstrate his methods of changing standard blues riffs 
into his idiosyncratic, jazzy pop songs. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Homespun folks get the usually hermit-like Fagen to do the tape? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a fan of what we do for quite a while," says Homespun founder and 
owner Happy Traum, a folk guitarist who has also made a number of his own 
lesson tapes.  
</P>
<P>
 But Traum adds, "It made it easier that he's a neighbor of ours up in 
Woodstock." Steve Hochman

 AND ONE MORE THING: Rhino Records had so much success with its "Golden 
Throats" albums a few years ago -- you know, the collections of such pop 
abominations as William Shatner Method acting through "Rocket Man" and 
Sebastian Cabot reciting Bob Dylan -- that the company is creating a whole new 
Golden Throats label. Three new volumes are being prepared: "Spy Music," "White 
Men Can't Rap" and "Soft, Safe & Sanitized." 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights (?) of the first include the original "James Bond," "Peter Gunn," 
"Mission Impossible" and "Goldfinger" themes, plus the likes of "Get Smart" 
co-star Barbara Feldon's "Messing With 99." The "White Men" edition features 
such dope deliveries as Jack Webb's "Try a Little Tenderness." The third volume 
sounds like the can't-miss collection, though, with Joel Grey's version of 
Cream's "White Room," the Lettermen harmonizing on the Doors' "Touch Me" and 
Bing Crosby's easygoing take on "Hey Jude."*

POP EYE: AD CAMPAIGN CAUSES PROMOTERS TO LOSE TASTE FOR MEAT LOAF TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Meat Loaf has sold a phenomenal 9 million copies of his 1993 comeback album, 
"Bat Out of Hell II: Back to Hell." So how come the Loaf couldn't even sell 
1,500 tickets for a Forum concert? 
</P>
<P>
 A show planned for Aug. 13 at the Inglewood arena, which holds about 18,000 
for concerts, has been canceled in light of those poor sales, and some industry 
observers are blaming a promotional scheme concocted by the singer's manager, 
Allen Kovac. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan involved putting all 61 of Meat Loaf's summer concert dates on sale 
the same day, with all the local concert promoters from across the country 
chipping in for a national advertising campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 That ad ran three weeks ago, and while in some parts of the country Meat Loaf 
shows at arenas and large amphitheaters have sold well, many others have not. 
Now, promoters say, most of their advertising budgets are gone while many of 
the tickets remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Most promoters interviewed did not want to be quoted on the issue. But many 
believe that the national campaign -- which reportedly cost $1 million and 
included ads in USA Today and commercials during "The Tonight Show" -- was a 
wasted effort.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you make the effort to sell broadly like that, not only is it more 
expensive, but you're diluting the effectiveness," says Ben Liss, executive 
director of the Washington-based North American Concert Promoters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Narrowcasting works better, focusing the advertising and promotion to reach 
the specific audience that buys tickets. When you take that out of the market 
and you take the dollars (for advertising) out, it has an impact."  
</P>
<P>
 Patience, counsels Kovac. Meat Loaf's manager says that promoters are 
panicking too quickly and that the national ad campaign was part of a larger 
scheme to raise the singer's profile and help the public view him as a 
legitimate arena-level artist. 
</P>
<P>
 A new single, "Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They 
Are," is being released this week, and Kovac is confident that it will help 
generate more interest in the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 But many promoters believe that Meat Loaf may not be the right artist to try 
the experiment with. Though his record sales have been huge, it was nearly 20 
years between his hit albums, and in the interim he did not establish himself 
as a big concert attraction.  
</P>
<P>
 The consensus is that there may be some merit to the national campaign, but a 
different kind of artist would provide a better test. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks like they'll get to find out. Kovac says that he's planning the same 
kind of effort for another of his clients, John Mellencamp. Look for his 
national concert campaign to hit simultaneously with the release of his new 
album, "Dance Naked," in late May. Steve Hochman

SOUND & VISION: PUMPKINS FLOAT IN SEARCH OF THE LOST INNER CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Childhood lost and found is a popular media theme these days -- but of course 
nowhere more so than among rock 'n' rollers, whose "inner children" are usually 
a little closer to the surface, waiting to be slapped upside the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Smashing Pumpkins' tender yet bitter "Disarm" continues in heavy rotation on 
MTV after three months on the air, no doubt because its look back at a little 
boy learning how to be hard strikes a chord with viewers who've been there 
distantly or (considering the demographics) just recently. 
</P>
<P>
 This edition of Sound & Vision -- where current music videos are reviewed and 
rated on a 0-100 scale -- also extends downward to include less gracefully 
nostalgic fare, from Seaweed's awfully funny "Kid Candy" to Enigma's awfully 
cheesy "Return to Innocence." Let the returnee beware. 
</P>
<P>
 Smashing Pumpkins, "Disarm." Remember that Talking Heads hit "And She Was," 
where the woman drifts up into the air out of her back yard for no apparent 
reason? That's what comes to mind as Billy Corgan and crew get similarly 
float-atious here, though their ballad isn't nearly so buoyant. 
</P>
<P>
 Corgan's wrenching, string-laden anthem represents a sort of dead-end attempt 
at reconvening with the "inner child." So director Jake Scott's 
lighter-than-air design suggests that there's a rush or elevation to these kind 
of therapeutic recollections of abandoned youth, but that the gravity of the 
compromised adult world never really loses hold. The foursome is seen in tight 
black-and-white close-up floating just over the gleaming spires of a city's 
housetops, but they never get too high. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a terribly expressionist video -- Corgan not being the type of guy to 
wear his heart on his sleeve in more than one medium at a time -- but the 
pathos is still smashing enough. 78 
</P>
<P>
 Seaweed, "Kid Candy." From childhood lost to childishness regained. . . . 
Here's the first really funny parody clip in a long while, as Seaweed 
irreverently spoofs Soul Asylum's award-winning "Runaway Train" video, which 
dramatized the tragic plight of abducted kids and runaways left to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sub Pop satire publicizes the plight of missing bikes , following an 
opening crawl that warns, "Over five zillion bicycles are stolen every year," 
with a vivid dramatization of a daring ten-speed heist at a suburban mall. And, 
a la Soul Asylum's milk-carton-like clip, the scenario is punctuated by still 
photos of totally boss two-wheelers with sad captions like "Missing since 
February." 
</P>
<P>
 If you've seen this Schwinn, don't call Dave Pirner. 73 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins Band, "Liar." Henry Rollins never seems to fare too well whenever 
anyone puts him in a movie -- they haven't yet found a bit role that can 
realistically accommodate his malevolent masculinity -- but his videos offer a 
better context for caricature. He's as exaggerated as usual playing the role of 
"Liar," flagrantly warning all comers that he's just the type of gent who'll 
tell women whatever they most want to hear and then laugh as he screws them 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 The tattooed one even puts on cherry-red body makeup, and the vaguely satanic 
guise seems to complete him, sort of the way Tim Curry really seemed home at 
last in his full "Legend" monster get-up. Subtleties be damned: He's the devil 
inside, and out. 69 
</P>
<P>
 Salt-N-Pepa with En Vogue, "Whatta Man." This salute is intended as homage to 
the modern male at his strong and sensitive best -- a corrective of sorts to 
rap's usual gender wars -- and fairly succeeds. But what the video ends up 
being an even bigger tribute to is Salt-N-Pepa's personal trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing with the trio's newfound molten-steel midriffs, meanwhile, are Dawn 
Robinson's phenomenal go-go bangs; there's just enough glory in reinvention 
here to go around for Everygal. Did somebody say something about guys? 68 
</P>
<P>
 Ace of Base, "The Sign." These Swedes have been labeled "the new ABBA," which 
is heady -- probably too heady -- praise indeed, at least to those of us who 
still hold the Scandinavian superstars of the '70s dear as irreplaceable 
demigods. But "The Sign" is a good sign that Ace of Base might measure up in 
some way, and not just because they share an ingenuous fondness for the capital 
letters A and B. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an obvious contemporary gloss, the women dance just as feebly yet 
sexily, and the men strike just the same kind of lovably pretentious poses, as 
Frida and Agnetha and Bjorn and Benny. And the irresistible production suggests 
what electronic bliss might have been if ABBA had lived past disco to work with 
Giorgio Moroder on a good day. 68 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna, "I'll Remember." Madonna -- seditionist, or shill? 
</P>
<P>
 During her appearance with David Letterman a few weeks back, on her worst 
behavior, she played the rebel and gave her host a rough time for "kissing ass" 
with his guests nowadays. So whose butt is she smooching, then, when she 
lip-syncs an earnestly dull movie theme ballad in front of film clips from a 
Joe Pesci vehicle, of all things? Her own, maybe, since it was her production 
company that made "With Honors," the movie being promoted? 
</P>
<P>
 She's made a career out of her good cop/bad cop routine, playing the pop 
public like a violin, with a good, rhythmic sense for how to alternate her 
provocative and populist strains -- until lately. On the Letterman show, 
Madonna played the bad lieutenant to the childish hilt; in this clip, she's 
sweet and clean as a whistle, if still on the take. After the "Late Show" 
debacle, America may be finding the split-personality shtick just a little 
harder to reconcile. 38 
</P>
<P>
 Guns N' Roses, "Since I Don't Have You." Amid many straight liaisons involving 
the band members, Axl Rose has two model chicks getting extremely chummy in 
GNR's latest overheated, over-budgeted, typically nonsensical video. So, we 
suppose, he's come a long way since the ballyhooed alleged homophobia of a 
couple albums back, but does his fondness for lipstick lesbians make him the 
Roseanne Arnold or the Bob Guccione Sr. of MTV? Only his newsstand operator 
knows for sure. 30 
</P>
<P>
 Motley Crue, "Hooligan's Holiday." The new, improved, in-Vince-ible Crue is 
taking itself awfully seriously these days. Either they or director Nick Egan 
have a bad case of Bono envy, as evidenced by this video, which heavily echoes 
the deliberately confusing "cut-up" style of U2's future-shock-embracing tour 
and videos. The Motley variation of "Zoo TV" is just Boob TV; as affectations 
go, they should've stopped at hair spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Who should feel most ripped off by this silly jumble: Stanley Kubrick (band 
members dress up as Malcolm McDowell's white-clad "Clockwork Orange" gang), 
visual artist John Baldessari (red stripes with printed slogans like "Control 
Your Enemies" and "Destroy Political Correctness" appear on screen), or U2's 
tour designers? Even hooligans, it turns out, get highfalutin. 20 
</P>
<P>
 Enigma, "Return to Innocence." Clearly Enigma was aiming for a return to Fort 
Knox with this latest mutt-like, multicultural blend of throb-rock and pre-pop 
archaism, now playing at middlebrow homes throughout the Hamptons. Meanwhile, 
director Julien Temple, who ought to know better, ends up running his reels of 
childhood-lost scenarios backward in an unfortunate bout of video literalism. 
Innocence never felt more cynical. 19

 You'll need to do what the title says to figure out why McEntire puts so much 
effort into so many stories of love-starved women wasting time pursuing their 
dead-end romantic fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 The women in these 10 songs rarely take any initiative in determining the 
course of their lives.They are passive characters who don't end up wiser, just 
sadder.  
</P>
<P>
 "She Thinks His Name Was John" is a prime example. From the viewpoint of a 
woman who still cries herself to sleep every night years after a drunken 
one-night stand, McEntire sings, "She won't know love, have a marriage or sing 
lullabies . . . 'cause she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 McEntire aims for drama, but settles for melodrama. Who knows? Romance-novel 
readers may find such situations tres romantique. One exception is the punchy, 
R & B-flavored "I Won't Stand in Line," in which the gutsy protagonist snaps a 
well-deserved ultimatum to a philanderer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other performances are soaked in the swelling strings, shimmering 
synthesizers, Richter-rattling crescendos and vocal acrobatics that have turned 
this once-gritty country singer into the Liza Minnelli of the Nashville set. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). RANDY LEWIS

 After pledging to walk 500 miles just to be with a woman, what next? Pop the 
question and pledge a blissful life together, 'til-death-us-do-part-etc. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Let's Get Married," the lead track of the Proclaimers' third album, the 
cheery Scottish twins Craig and Charlie Reid do just that.That follow-up to 
"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)" -- one of the grandest, most gleeful statements of 
love and devotion in recent pop, and a left-field hit last year thanks to its 
use in the film "Benny & Joon" -- carries on with the older song's bubbly 
optimism and skiffly melodic catchiness. 
</P>
<P>
 That irrepressible faith in love and life is also turned dramatically 
heavenward. Any Christian youth camp would do well to latch onto "The More I 
Believe" and "The Light" for evening sing-alongs, and there's a folk-rock 
gospel fervor (via Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers) throughout the album. 
There's spirit -- holy and otherwise -- to burn with these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Corny stuff? You bet. But it's also heartfelt, never shallow and always 
irresistible.

 ** 1/2 London Suede, "Stay Together," Columbia/Nude. On this six-song EP, the 
former Suede tones down the glammy decadence and dramatics that defined its 
1993 debut and comes up far less alluring.The vocals still quaver a la Bowie, 
but now emit less emotion, while the music is smooth rather than grandiose. 
Though "Stay" doesn't render London Suede dead, it threatens to fulfill the 
flash-in-the-pan prophecy that's always followed the band.

 ** Carcass, "Heartwork," Earache/Columbia. Has British grindcore band Carcass 
matured since its early death-metal songs such as "Feast on Dismembered 
Carnage"? The hyper-speed riffs and depths-of-hell vocals on "Heartwork" say 
no.But Carcass' fourth record in nine years does take a slightly more melodic 
and accessible approach, though the lyrics are still as deliberately abstruse 
as the band's dense musicality.

 MAN IN THE STUDIO: Michael Jackson, returning to music for the first time 
since he canceled his concert tour last year amid a sexual abuse investigation, 
will soon enter the studio to record some new songs -- but what they're for is 
anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility is material to fill out a long-planned greatest-hits album.The 
last time Jackson entered a studio to record some new tracks for the collection 
-- which has been in the works for years -- he was so prolific he came up with 
his 1991 album "Dangerous."  
</P>
<P>
 "He's going in under the same circumstances," says a Sony Music source, 
referring to the open-ended nature of the sessions. "The only question is 
whether it grows any bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson spokesman Michael Levine confirms that Jackson will be recording some 
new songs "before too long," but declined to say when the sessions would begin.

 VOCAL BREAK: Jeff Charroux, lead singer of the band Ultra Violet Eye, is 
sitting in for Greta's Paul Plagens on Greta's current East Coast tour while 
Plagens completes his recovery program at a Los Angeles-area substance abuse 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We assumed the band wouldn't be able to do the tour," says Mercury Records' 
Mike Sikkas, East Coast senior director of A&R."On a creative level, it didn't 
really fly . . . but after considerable discussion -- and Paul was in the loop 
on all of this -- rather than disrupt the momentum and have the whole band 
victimized, we chose to continue with the tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Plagens hopes to rejoin Greta, which created such a buzz on the Los Angeles 
rock scene in 1992 that it became the object of a major record company bidding 
war, for scheduled dates with Motorhead beginning next Sunday. Katherine Turman

<TEXT>

 The word is that the long-awaited Dr. Dre/Snoop Doggy Dogg tour will finally 
hit the road in early June -- with conflicting reports about whether Hammer 
will be part of it. . . . Motown is reportedly putting together a tribute album 
to Marvin Gaye, featuring versions of his songs by other artists. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Anita Baker has an album and, possibly, a tour in the fall. . . . An album 
from Teddy Riley's new group BLACKstreet is due in late June and it reportedly 
features a "progressive" version of Riley's new jack swing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Erasure's first full album in three years, "I Say, I Say, I Say," is due May 
17. A video has been shot for the first single, "Always," featuring singer Andy 
Bell as a fantasy Kabuki figure protecting a young girl from a puppet monster. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the normal package, the new Boingo album will also be released May 17 
in a limited-edition, deluxe package that includes a 50-page book featuring 
photos of Danny Elfman's art collection. The album will include a version of "I 
Am the Walrus." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Lee Blackman of Santa Monica, who is now representing the Harry 
Nilsson estate, says that record companies are interested in the album that the 
singer-songwriter was working on at the time of his death on Jan. 15, but the 
earliest release date would be in the fall -- to avoid clashing with an RCA box 
set due this summer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A&M Records will release an as yet untitled Joe Cocker three-CD box set in the 
late summer that will cover the singer's entire career. It includes the version 
of "With a Little Help From my Friends" that Cocker sang at Woodstock. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Also coming in May is "Dulcinea," a new album by Toad the Wet Sprocket. The 
band will play a benefit for the Santa Barbara Rape Crisis Center on May 28 in 
a field adjacent to UC Santa Barbara. . . . The second major-label album by 
Helmet, with Page Hamilton, is due out June 21. It's titled "Betty." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sinead O'Connor is doing a lot of guest spots these days: She's on several 
tracks of world beat star Manu Dibango's album -- due in late June -- including 
a version of Peter Gabriel's "Biko" that features Gabriel and Ladysmith Black 
Mambazo. She's also singing on a cut on the new album by the Marxmen, an 
interracial Irish rap quartet, that's out May 17.*

 Marshall Herskovitz's 1993 film of the 1972 Dan McCall novel tells the story 
of a 12-year-old (Robert J. Steinmiller Jr., right, in the title role, with 
Miko Hughes, center) whose father (Danny DeVito) is the host of a late-night 
monster movie TV show. The film is essentially about how Jack comes to realize 
the real monsters in life.In moments of stress, Jack's memories of his mother 
(Andrea Marcovicci), killed in a car accident, haunt him. The film, scripted by 
"Schindler's List" Oscar winner Steven Zaillian, focuses on the boy's pain 
without apology, and while DeVito is miscast, this flaw is not fatal because 
the movie really belongs to Steinmiller's portrayal (Cinemax Sunday at 8 p.m.; 
Wednesday at 3:15 p.m.; Saturday at 6:15 p.m.). Peter Rainer

 You instantly feel that the epic 20th-Century despot so ably depicted by 
Robert Duvall in HBO's 1992 "Stalin" is someone to fear deeply.The feeling 
lasts from the moment you meet him being rejected for World War I service in 
the czar's crumbling army until his death in 1953, surrounded by toadies at his 
dacha in Kuntsevo. The Soviet Union and its history, however, overmatch a 
small-screen movie of a little less than three hours. Yet because there's 
something disturbingly charismatic about evil, this is a fascinating character 
study even in outline form (HBO Monday at 4 p.m.). Howard Rosenberg

CRITICS' PICKS: 'THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS'

<TEXT>

 This 1992 release comes at you like a tomahawk. Hard, fast and brutal, it 
slashes and leaves you for dead. Undeniably exciting as this definitely is, its 
impact comes at the expense of some of the gentler virtues, qualities that even 
top-drawer barn-burners really shouldn't ignore.Unashamedly based more on the 
1936 movie version than the James Fenimore Cooper novel, it takes place in 1757 
during the French and Indian War, when those two sides united in an attempt to 
drive the British, who had tribal allies of their own, out of North America. A 
lean and steely-eyed Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Hawkeye, colonial-born but 
raised as the adopted son of the Mohicans' chief. Directed by Michael Mann 
(Cinemax Saturday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; BOY (BEN SAVAGE) MEETS SITCOM 'WORLD' IN ABC LOOK AT A 
TEEN IN PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the clever opening credits of ABC's "Boy Meets World," 13-year-old star Ben 
Savage observes the animated whirlwind of the world around him, readily fending 
off flying objects. In daily life, it's impossible for Savage to fend off 
questions about following in the footsteps of older brother Fred, now 18, who 
starred in ABC's long-running "The Wonder Years." 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy Meets World" was conceived as a project for the younger Savage, who 
impressed producers with his turns in television, features and, last year, as a 
boy with the soul of a killer in ABC's "event" series "Wild Palms." 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy Meets World" producer Michael Jacobs acknowledges that a comparison 
between brothers Ben and Fred would seem inevitable. But their two series, 
though both centered on coming-of-age adolescents, have obvious differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The often-poignant "Wonder Years," set in the late '60s, offered an adult 
Kevin's voice-over reflections on growing up, spoken by Daniel Stern. The 
contemporary sitcom "Boy Meets World" presents outgoing 12-year-old Cory's very 
verbal and often snide observations, which sometimes work against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cory and I are pretty much alike," says Ben, who resembles a pint-sized 
Albert Brooks. "Sometimes I talk out in class like he does, but he has a lot 
more courage than I do. He'll say something even if it ends up being really 
bad. I couldn't do that or wouldn't because I would get in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutored three hours a day while on the "Boy" set, Savage attends school in Los 
Angeles every other week. Education is given top priority at the Savage home, 
where he can't be interrupted, even during breaks or lunch, for TV-related 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ben's family insists on a full workload and rightfully so," adds William 
Daniels, who plays teacher Mr. Feeney on "Boy Meets World." "Education is very 
important to the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben has been tutored on the set while appearing in the film "Little Monsters," 
guesting on big bro's "The Wonder Years," and other TV shows, including "She 
Woke Up," "A Family for Joe" and "Dear John." He's appeared in the films "Big 
Girls Don't Cry" and the recent Martin Short release "Clifford," which Ben 
points out was made two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The young actor, a tennis fanatic, wants to continue in comedy and would love 
to be a writer. And what better preparation than good books? A voracious 
reader, Ben has recently devoured "Inherit the Wind" and "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. 
Hyde." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Ben: "You know, Cory is just meeting the world every week and so am I." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers think that Ben Savage meets the world very nicely, thank you. "He's 
just wonderful," Jacobs says with admiration. "You can see how he really is in 
his relationship with cast members and what he presents to the audience. His 
eyes sparkle and he has this great sincere smile." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels concurs. "I'm inordinately fond of him, and I know that sounds corny 
when I've said it before, but it's true. He's a very talented boy, too. He'll 
go as far as he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard for Ben to stand the scrutiny of the bright light of his older 
brother, but he can do anything and probably will," Jacobs says. "He's held the 
strenuous task of leading a cast and being a TV star. I just hope the show is 
around when Ben gets the keys to his car and he can drive into any future he 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy Meets World" airs Fridays at 8:30 p.m. on ABC.

RESTAURANT NEWS: MORE THAN 200 ESTABLISHMENTS WANT TO LAND AT LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The word's gotten out. After voting last month not to renew the contract of 
Host Marriott, which has handled all food operations at Los Angeles 
International Airport for the past 34 years, the airport commissioners took out 
ads in newspapers and trade magazines asking for proposals on running the 
facility's food and beverage concessions ranging from fast-food stands to 
restaurants, bakeries and sushi bars. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 restaurants and fast-food outlets have expressed interest in 
feeding the 46 million passengers who each spend an average $2.05 while passing 
through LAX every year: Wolfgang Puck Foods, Daily Grill, Tony Roma's, 
California Chicken Cafe, Manhattan Bagel Company, Ocean Seafood, Uncle 
Robbie's, King Taco, McDonald's, Ruby's diner, Silver Wings Restaurant and Bar, 
Panda Express, Citi Deli and Tea House of New Jersey Inc., to name a few. The 
group will meet at the airport Monday morning for a pre-bidding conference and 
a tour of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no longer going to be all the same stale food from Host and all the 
companies they have agreements with," says Judith Sobject of the airport's 
contract services bureau. "We have had calls from all over the country. I even 
had a call from a woman who is translating our ad into Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 Also up for grabs is the lonely, giant, space-like Theme structure that's 
perched in the middle of the airport. So far, airport officials have talked to 
Daily Grill and Wolfgang Puck Foods about running the restaurant. "Nobody wants 
it because it's a (money) loser," Sobject says, "so we've packaged it with some 
other lucrative locations, hoping somebody will go for it."  
</P>
<P>
 "I just got the bid form which is the size of the Los Angeles phone book," 
says Daily Grill's Bob Spivak. "The Marriotts and the ARAs are set up to bid on 
these sort of things. I just don't know if we are going to be able to deal with 
the process. You need to hire a company just to put the bid together. Why not 
sit down at a bargaining table and negotiate a lease? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good, casual dining places in Los Angeles right now, 
between the Chin Chins and Louise's and California Pizza Kitchens and Wolfgang 
Pucks. Other airports have real food. Los Angeles is an embarrassment. But if 
they keep this bid process up, I just don't see them getting anything but the 
same old thing in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals must be submitted by June 24, with the first restaurants to open by 
December. Another 25 restaurants and bars will be run by a general contractor. 
Host Marriott, currently operating on a month-to-month contract, has expressed 
interest in that job.  
</P>
<P>
 Was Host upset about losing the lucrative contract? 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding?" says Sobject. "They buy up companies to get in airports." 
</P>
<P>
 PRINCEDOM: Chef Robert Gadsby has packed up his knives at Olive on Fairfax to 
cook at Trocadero, the latest addition to rock star Prince's empire (which also 
includes the hot Glam Slam club downtown on Boylston and 3rd streets). The 
60-seat restaurant will open for lunch and dinner next month and feature lots 
of wines by the glass and things like rice-paper-wrapped salmon with polenta 
chop sticks, house-cured salmon and a vegetarian bento box. No entree costs 
more than $15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be a place where everybody can go when they leave Roxbury or Glam 
Slam or places like that," says co-owner Bambi Byrens, who used to manage the 
Divinyls, "so we've applied to the City of West Hollywood to be open after 
hours. We promised not to bother any of the neighbors and said we wouldn't play 
any loud music . . . just some of Prince's latest CDs." 
</P>
<P>
 MORE OPENINGS: Francoli Gourmet Emporio has opened in the Newport Fashion 
Island, where Italian designer imports including glassware, cheese, prosciutto 
di Parma and pastas are for sale. According to a press release, the idea is to 
introduce Americans to "a true feeling of being in Italy and shopping as the 
Italians themselves do." Those would be the Italians with money. . . . If you 
can't get into Kevin Costner's hot, 450-seat Twin Palms in Pasadena, there's 
always the Fantastic French Fry Company two blocks away, which specializes in 
gourmet fries with hot and cold dipping sauces. Signature dishes include 
Catalina pizza fries, Creole frank-'n'-fry, spicy meatloaf fries, and fries 
Benedict. . . . Ready for more Rostis? Augustino Sciandri and partners Kathie 
and Michael Gordon, who also own the nearby Toscana in Brentwood as well as 
Terrazza Toscana in Encino, will open two more Italian take-aways, one in what 
used to be Mario's Cooking for Friends on Beverly Boulevard, the other in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSING: You still have 14 more weeks to eat at Nicky Blair's before the 
Sunset Strip restaurant closes.*

ROCK 'N' ROLE MODELS

<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to thank Lorraine Ali and The Times for the article on women in 
the music industry ("Women Rockers -- the Sound and the Fury," April 10). 
</P>
<P>
 Bands like Hole, Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, 7 Year Bitch and Babes in Toyland 
have inspired other women, including myself -- they are the reason I picked up 
a guitar and attempted to play in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 I am glad that these great female leaders are getting the spotlight. Let's 
hope that they will inspire other women to start bands and look into the female 
revolution. It's not every day that you can open a newspaper and see a good, 
open-minded article about female bands. 
</P>
<P>
 COURTNEY HAMILTON 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 Ali and those she quotes fail to mention one of rock's great voices and an 
"intelligent, strong, different" woman (to use rock critic Evelyn McDonnell's 
criteria) who has been writing and performing for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A.'s own Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde has shown herself to be an 
independent and creative songwriter as well as an artist (she's opened the 
Lucky Nun Gallery in her Silver Lake neighborhood) and contributor of her time 
to AIDS awareness and other causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I'm sorry that Concrete Blonde is calling it quits, perhaps 
Napolitano's future solo work will bring her the recognition and attention her 
fantastic voice and talent deserve. 
</P>

<P>
 Notably absent from your article was the absorbingly hypnotic Hope Sandoval, 
lead singer of Mazzy Star. Her bluesy, inaccessible, psychedelic strangeness 
reminds me of Jim Morrison. Or maybe Stevie Nicks on LSD. 
</P>
<P>
 A buddy with whom I recently saw Sandoval's band thought she was demonic (I 
disagree), capable of possessing people. And yet he couldn't quit talking about 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting one of her songs: "She's just like lightning. She goes right through 
you."

HAUTE AND BOTHERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was disappointed to read in last Sunday's Restaurant News ("French Consul 
Fries L.A., Steams at Figaro") the excerpts of interviews made to Figaro Madame 
magazine by French Consul General Jean-Maurice Ripert, L'Orangerie owner Gerard 
Ferry and my ex-wife, Sophie Healy, owner of Champagne Bis restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Their collective reproach of the life and of the people of Los Angeles 
represents the sort of arrogance that has so severely damaged the once-dominant 
force of French restaurants in America.It is also unfortunate that these few 
disconsolate expatriates are damaging the image and efforts of many 
hard-working French people who are happy and thankful to be living and working 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As an American who has lived and worked in France extensively and who has 
devoted his professional career toward cooking and promoting French cuisine, I 
find their comments particularly offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 I was also saddened to read of my ex-wife's continued bitterness toward me and 
now my family. She is the mother of my only child, and I hold only best wishes 
for her.

 "A Baldwin Brothers Crib Sheet" was a hoot until I read the line about Stephen 
Baldwin -- "hairless as a pre-adolescent" (Film Clips, April 3). 
</P>
<P>
 What a snide, gratuitously negative way to describe a man with a smooth chest! 
The anonymous "Film Clips staff" reduces smoothness in men to a kind of 
arrested development, as if such men were stuck in puberty. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you let this same limited standard of male beauty ostracize such 
"hairless" types as Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has the biggest smooth chest 
ever, or Tom Cruise, Richard Gere, Mel Gibson, Liam Neeson, Patrick Swayze, 
Michael Douglas, Gabriel Byrne, Don Johnson or good old Paul Newman? 
</P>
<P>
 The gutless writers who refused a byline owe an apology to Stephen Baldwin. 
And to Paul Newman too. Hell, you owe all the smooth-chested guys out there an 
apology. 
</P>
<P>
 I just had to get that, ahem, off my chest.

 Your writing staff proved that sexism and the double standard are alive and 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's just say that an identically flavored article appeared in Calendar, but 
instead of the Baldwin brothers, you featured the breast-size differences of 
sisters Meg and Jennifer Tilly or a facial-hair shaving analysis of the 
not-all-related Leighs: Janet, Jennifer Jason and Vivien. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what would the women's organizations do when presented with such an 
article? Since when is it politically correct to make sexist and abusive 
remarks about a man's physical appearance, even if it's only a "joke"? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm tired of the behind-the-back posturing of the media getting their jollies 
by demeaning men and manhood while presenting themselves as a voice for 
equality and fairness.

A LEAGUE OF HER OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the Ivy League takeover of television ("From the Halls of Ivy . . . 
to a Table at the Ivy," by Robert Strauss, April 3): 
</P>
<P>
 While Brandeis alum Marta Kaufmann is by all accounts extremely creative, 
capable and intelligent (and her show, "Dream On," is a riot), her alma mater 
is no more "Ivy League" than mine (UC Berkeley). 
</P>
<P>
 But that's OK, because you didn't include Kaufmann in your story because of 
her Ivy League cachet.You included her because she's a woman. Without her, you 
would not have had a single female participant in the Ivy League TV- and 
sitcom-writer trend you have reported. And that, I'm afraid, is the real story. 
</P>
<P>
 For while it is somewhat interesting that the Ivy League old-boys network has 
put down roots in Hollywood, it's not at all surprising -- it's rather 
inevitable. These people are trained from the first day of freshman year to 
exude maximum self-importance and to go where the money is. 
</P>
<P>
 Why wouldn't the same smart-and-smug network of Eastern privilege and nepotism 
that has reigned supreme in such fields as banking, big business and publishing 
do the same in Tinseltown? 
</P>
<P>
 It's to their credit that smart and determined women, such as Kaufmann, from 
less exclusive (i.e., non-Ivy or almost-Ivy) backgrounds have succeeded in the 
entertainment business by bucking this old-boy trend, not by riding it.

<P>
 In last Sunday's "Little Box in the Lower Left-Hand Corner," Pam Palmer cites 
a recent Film Clip, asking what the big deal is concerning male frontal nudity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore Vidal has elucidated this point in one of his essays ("Women's 
Liberation: Feminism and Its Discontents"): "Though female nudes have been 
usually accepted in our Puritan culture, until recently the male nude was 
unacceptable to the Patriarchs. After all, the male -- any male -- is a 
stand-in for God, and God wears a suit at all times, or at least jockey 
shorts."

 Whoa. First Holocaust revisionism, and now Vietnam revisionism (Letters, April

 Ted Turner is closer to history than reader Fred Landesman of Chatsworth. 
After World War II, once the Japanese were gone, the French invaded "French 
Indochina" to reclaim their colonial possessions. The Vietnamese eventually 
managed to kick them out -- Dien Bien Phu (1954) was the decisive battle, their 
Tet.

 The United States then took over the French role, against the strongly

UP ALL NIGHT / MARK EHRMAN: SOCIAL CLIMES; AN EVENING IN IGUANALAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK EHRMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Iguana Cafe isn't your average coffeehouse. This carnival of all things 
funky was a Valley mecca for music, poetry and art long before the 1992 
creation of the North Hollywood Arts District (NoHo) along the old downtown 
strip, which, ironically, left the Iguana just outside its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 At the counter, there are cassettes and CDs -- many of them very independently 
produced -- of the cafe's regular performers, as well as poetry chapbooks, 
zines, and crafts and T-shirts by local artists. 
</P>
<P>
 There are walls of used books, incense, Tarot cards, Andean rain sticks, 
"Iguana Lisa" handbags and an array of snacks, sodas and cookies. Oddly enough, 
the only thing that's not for sale at this coffeehouse is the coffee. It's 
free. Regular or decaf. Help yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because this place is about the people performing," says Tom Ianiello, 
owner of the New Age/hippie/countercultural haven, used bookstore and 
performance venue in one. "I'm not interested in having people on stage playing 
music or reading and having to shout over the cappuccino maker." 
</P>
<P>
 Ianiello opened Iguana -- which he also calls "The People's Democratic 
Republic of Iguanaland" -- because, he says, "I was otherwise unemployable." 
</P>
<P>
 The place lives up to its more fanciful moniker not only by its groovy motifs 
and its ultra-liberal policy of accepting the community's work on consignment, 
but, more important, by keeping the cover charge down to proletarian levels and 
keeping the place open to all ages from teens to seniors. Since it first opened 
just off the beaten path along Lankershim Boulevard in 1989, the Iguana has 
consistently brought in such renowned L.A. musical figures as Exene Cervenka, 
John Doe and Dave Alvin, as well as opening its stage to a host of undiscovered 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the acts are all acoustic, no performer has to shout. When the lights 
go down, the patrons, among them a hard core of neighborhood regulars who treat 
this as their living room away from home, arrange their chairs in semi-circles 
around the tables facing the stage and listen quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just an excellent place to both perform and hang out," says 
27-year-old Matthew Niblock, a singer-songwriter of "unclassifiable alternative 
music" whose allegiance to the Iguana is so strong he had his wedding reception 
here. "People are really into the music. I love this place." 
</P>
<P>
 The types of genres here span the musical gamut -- R&B, folk, salsa, bossa 
nova and experimental, plus poetry and other varieties of the spoken word. One 
thing you won't ever hear at Iguana, however, are cover tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all original," Ianiello says. "That's our one rule."

 BUS BUZZ: Where else but in Santa Monica could a simple bus ride turn into a 
rolling round table on the homeless? 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard the Big Blue Bus last Thursday, all eyes were on an elderly woman who 
bore all the disturbing signs of the dispossessed. Four large plastic bags of 
belongings wobbled beside her. Instead of shoes, she wore a thick padding of 
tape around each foot. A pile of newspapers rested on her lap. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was enough to yank at the heartstrings of even the most jaded 
observers, and her departure on tony Montana Avenue triggered a burst of social 
consciousness. "Can you imagine?" one rider asked a fellow passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the happiest people I know," the driver volunteered. "She's very 
fortunate in some ways." 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger who claimed to know the woman agreed, saying, "She doesn't have a 
care in the world. . . . She'd never be happy in an apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion then turned to solving the homeless problem, and the talk took 
on a decidedly less sympathetic tone. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver came down squarely for warehousing the homeless in vacant military 
barracks. Others countered that most homeless people would never cotton to such 
settings -- and the driver ultimately agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want the pricey real estate," he said, gesturing toward the Pacific 
Ocean. "They want the beaches and parks paid for by taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone nodded in sullen silence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OUT OF ORDER: Coming as they do at the end of the agenda, meeting items 
initiated by Santa Monica City Council members are only for the hardy. For 
those with sufficient stamina, however, these discussions are often the most 
entertaining, newsworthy or contentious of the night. Sometimes all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the items are a snooze, however, you can always count on them being at 
the end of the meeting. So much so that when council members have in the past 
sought to reorder the agenda, their efforts have been squashed by Mayor Judy 
Abdo on grounds that the public expects the agenda to go forward as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, was Santa Monica Police Chief James T. Butts standing at the podium 
at about 7:30 p.m. answering questions about a proposal to add full-time police 
patrols to Palisades Park? That discussion was supposed to be at the end of the 
meeting, not near the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdo said she asked to upend the agenda because a city staff member's report 
to the council was imprisoned in a malfunctioning computer and they were trying 
to retrieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her past reluctance to reconfigure agendas at the last minute, Abdo 
said she didn't think doing so was a big deal. "I said fine, I didn't care," 
Abdo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said she had expected the discussion of policing in Palisades Park 
to be completed in a few minutes. That clearly represented a triumph of hope 
over experience, as matters involving the parks, the homeless and the police 
are anything but quickly resolved in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the discussion went on for an hour.

SANTA MONICA ADOPTS QUAKE REBUILDING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Way We Were" would make a fitting theme song for the Santa Monica City 
Council earthquake rebuilding program. 
</P>
<P>
 The final plan, adopted by the council last week, places a premium on 
returning the city to the way it was before the earthquake -- warts and all. 
</P>
<P>
 It allows commercial and single-family structures to be rebuilt to their 
original form and allows apartment houses to be 15% larger to encourage 
rebuilding. The plan also mandates that a portion of units in rebuilt buildings 
contain affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan does not address one of the most prominent "warts" that existed 
before Jan. 17: lack of parking in areas with multifamily housing, especially 
north of Wilshire Boulevard, an area heavily hit by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the apartment buildings damaged in the quake were constructed before 
1937, when the city had no parking requirements, according to a city staff 
report. Moreover, about 90% were built with less parking than would be required 
under today's standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, however, decided not to require additional parking than was 
already in place when the temblor hit, reasoning that to do so would thwart 
rebuilding because of added costs. 
</P>
<P>
 On this point, the real estate interests and the council agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Where they parted company, however, was on the rebuilding requirements and the 
amount of affordable housing that will be required for buildings that need 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's rebuilding laws require one-fourth of the units to be set aside 
for low- and moderate-income families as part of the city's philosophy to 
provide affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council, relying on a ludicrous financial analysis, imposed a 25% 
low-income (unit) requirement on reconstruction that will be impossible for 
landlords to meet," said attorney Rosario Perry. "What will happen is that the 
buildings most severely damaged will stay that way for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The result, Perry said, is that "tenants who could live in Santa Monica will 
have to live elsewhere until the City Council wakes up." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Chris Harding, who has represented the Los Angeles Apartment Owners 
Assn. while the rebuilding plan was being devised, agreed that the plan is 
well-meaning, though shortsighted in part because of its inflexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was referring to requirements that limit construction to prior 
configuration of the buildings, without leeway for individual circumstances. 
City Planning Director Suzanne Frick said a measure to allow homeowners to 
reconfigure their homes, but still qualify for fee waivers, will be on the 
council agenda this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Frick said the formula is the city's best effort at balancing the "needs and 
character of the city with need to reconstruct in a timely fashion. . . . We're 
confident this will work for the majority of properties." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Frick said, those who must rebuild are getting a lot more latitude 
than they would have if they came to propose a new project. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because restrictions on building density have been tightened several 
times in the past decade. But owners whose buildings took a hit in the 
earthquake can rebuild them the same way as they could in the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sacrificing something to get something back," Frick said.

BATTLE LOOMS OVER VENICE BOARDWALK; COMMERCE: OFFICIALS ORDER A SERIES OF 
COMMUNITY WORKSHOPS TO SETTLE THE FIGHT OVER HOW TO RESHAPE THE LANDMARK. NEW 
RESTRICTIONS ON CHARITY VENDORS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT MONTH. 
</P>

 Expect a stormy summer at Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The onset of the beach season finds a community bitterly divided over how to 
spend $10 million approved for a Venice Boardwalk renovation, and over new 
restrictions on nonprofit groups who peddle causes -- and often merchandise -- 
at tables on public park land. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in contentious Venice, it's been years since residents have brawled as 
long and loud as in recent meetings on the future of the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 During a rancorous six-hour meeting last Wednesday, the city Board of 
Recreation and Parks Commissioners ordered a series of community workshops to 
settle the fight over how the beach should be renovated. The board also decided 
to try out new restrictions on nonprofit groups, starting next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations require charities and other groups to have proof of nonprofit 
status and limit them to a six-foot space along the western edge of the 
boardwalk, city land where an existing ban on sales is often flouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners quickly approved the restrictions after hearing a fierce debate 
that pitted private merchants bedeviled by illegal vending against performers 
and activists who said the rules violate constitutional freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "To make them criminals -- you are in essence killing Venice," said Harry 
Perry, the roller-skating boardwalk regular who plays guitar and sells 
cassettes of his music. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules, proposed by a business group called the Venice Boardwalk Assn., do 
not affect artists and performers. A city task force is still studying a 
separate proposal to require artists to get city permits before selling their 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters said new restrictions were needed to reduce crowding and curb 
commercial sales of T-shirts and sunglasses by groups claiming to be charities. 
They are also seeking a change in the city's no-vending law that would close a 
loophole so groups cannot sell items that do not directly promote their 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Restrictions will be in place from May 30 to Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The board approved spending $7 million for the boardwalk make-over and about 
$3 million to fix the closed Venice Pier, leaving for later the volatile 
question of what shape the boardwalk renovation will take. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners will rely on the community workshops to find middle ground 
between allies of the boardwalk association -- whose refurbishment scheme 
includes a controversial proposal to pave the boardwalk in brick -- and 
opponents who fear an attempt to gentrify the funky beach site. The workshops 
will begin in June or July. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite vehement opposition, the board voted to hire as workshop consultants 
the same Venice architects who volunteered to draw up the association's 
renovation plan last year. Many residents complained that the firm's ties to 
that plan created a conflict of interest, making it unfair to those favoring an 
alternative plan for the boardwalk. They urged commissioners to hire a firm 
without ties to either of the two plans proposed so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative boardwalk plan, proposed by a group led by activist Jerry 
Rubin, would exclude brick and save the Venice Pavilion, which would be 
demolished under the association's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio of Design will be paid $98,600 to prepare cost estimates and 
incorporate residents' opinions into possible designs. Officials from the 
city's Recreation and Parks Department will actually lead the sessions and 
recommend a final design to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The parks panel also agreed to solicit proposals from nonprofit groups 
interested in renovating the pavilion for community use. The Venice Arts Mecca 
has proposed an arts center for the former theater, which has stood idle for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners allotted $100,000 from the $10-million park fund to help pay for 
the restoration of Ballona Lagoon, though supporters had sought $300,000.

BRAVE NEW WORLD; STUDENTS USE CULTURAL-EXCHANGE TRIP TO ISRAEL TO HELP SHATTER 
STEREOTYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood High School student Paul McDonald learned a lot on his 
cultural-exchange trip to Israel -- starting with an eye-opening exchange of 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were standing on a corner in Jerusalem, and this Israeli girl asked us if 
we were from New York," said Paul, one of nine Latino and African American high 
school students from Los Angeles to take part in the trip, which ended last 
week. "Then she asked if we were gangsters. I guess she got that from what she 
sees on television." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, he says, he was surprised to see that Jews "came in all shapes 
and colors. There were Asian, Pacific Islander, African and Mexican Jews in 
Israel . . . I thought all Jews were just rich white people." 
</P>
<P>
 The roster for the eight-day trip consisted of one student from Hollywood 
High, Crenshaw High and seven other Los Angeles schools. Organized and 
sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League, the excursion included visits to 
schools, a kibbutz and cultural centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were selected for the trip by Anti-Defamation officials after being 
nominated by teachers at their schools and submitting essays on why they wanted 
to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Defamation League member Bill Lambert, who organized fund-raisers to 
finance the trip, came up with the idea a few years ago as he was watching news 
reports on the exodus of Ethiopian Jews to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I were interested in seeing if we could bring about better 
relations between African Americans and Jews," said Lambert, who works as a 
lobbyist for United Teachers Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he went to Marjorie Green, an education official with the 
Anti-Defamation League, and helped organize a visit to Los Angeles that year by 
a group of Ethiopian Jews whose families had emigrated to Israel. A second 
group of Ethiopian Jews spent a week in Los Angeles last November, attending 
classes at Los Angeles high schools and living with American families. 
</P>
<P>
 On this month's trip to Israel, the Los Angeles students attended classes with 
Israeli teen-agers, spent a night in Bedouin tents, got a taste of communal 
life on a kibbutz and visited the Ethiopian Jews who journeyed to Los Angeles 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids from Los Angeles and the Ethiopian kids have both experienced 
discrimination," said Aviva Kadosh of the Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the program, said Kadosh, was to show American students of 
color that the Jewish experience is similar to their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyndasha Dukes, 16, said she was struck by the pride Israelis take in their 
religion, their country and their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed by how they wanted to go to the Army," said the Crenshaw High 
School student. All Israeli youth, before attending college, must serve in the 
Army for a year. "For them, it's a sign of maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 The students stayed with a group of nomadic Bedouins in a desert region north 
of Tel Aviv. "The tent was OK, but I'm not used to being close to nature and 
all those bugs," said Lyndasha. 
</P>
<P>
 The sexism of the Bedouin culture, said the girls, was shocking. "The men 
marry four women, " said Lillian Miranda, a junior at the Downtown Business 
Magnet in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bedouin leader said a woman is 'like a car. If one gets sick, you get a 
new one,' " she said. "I was so disappointed. And when I asked if a woman can 
marry more than one husband, he said he was insulted by that question." 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian said that for her, the highlights of the trip included a camel ride, a 
visit to the Jordan River and spotting a Ben and Jerry's ice cream parlor near 
the Zion Hotel in Jerusalem. But by far the most moving experience, she said, 
was a tour of the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really big, five floors. In the memorial for the children who died in 
the Holocaust, there were only six lit candles in a dark room, but they were 
reflected in a lot of mirrors, so it looked like thousands and thousands of 
candles," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "And as we walked around, a man read the names of the children, and how old 
they were when they died," she said. "I wanted to cry when I heard their 
names." 
</P>
<P>
 The students said they noticed some similarities between Tel Aviv and Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the Jewish homeland, I saw that the Russian Jews didn't accept the 
Ethiopian Jews, and vice versa," said Paul, after visiting a center that houses 
recently immigrated Ethiopian and Russian Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just talking to people on the street, immigrants, I got the uncensored 
viewpoint that Israel isn't this perfect utopia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Israeli schools, the American students discussed everything from course 
work to Arab-Israeli tensions. In the process, they encountered some of the 
subtleties in a country that, for some of them, seemed a distant war-torn land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about the problems of the Arabs and Israelis at one school," said 
Paul. He recalled that one of the students, a Jewish girl, pointed to another, 
an Arab boy, and said: "This is my friend. I don't see him as an Arab. He's my 
friend."

TUNING IN TO A SPOOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you worship at the shrine of Andrew Lloyd Webber, perhaps "Forbidden 
Broadway 1994" is not the show for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the tone is basically a love of Broadway -- although it certainly 
knocks it," said Gerard Alessandrini, whose satirical revue is playing a 
six-week run at the Tiffany Theatre in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest incarnation of Alessandrini's 12-year-old musical offers topical 
and irreverent takes on such stage hits as "Sunset Boulevard," "The Phantom of 
the Opera," "Guys & Dolls," "Les Miserables," "Joseph and the Amazing 
Technicolor Dreamcoat," "Damn Yankees," "Cats" and "Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of admiration for these people, and I think it comes through," 
added Alessandrini, 39, referring to the creators and stars of Broadway shows. 
"Besides, a spoof is a celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Lansbury (whom he spoofed in her "Sweeney Todd" role, and now satirizes 
in "Beauty and the Beast") "is a good sport about it," Alessandrini said. "A 
lot of people in the community are. Hal Prince loves to see the shows. So does 
Cameron Mackintosh. Stephen Sondheim said, 'The meaner, the funnier.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And the New York-based Alessandrini is more than happy to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to write parodies of shows when I'd see them -- just for myself and 
friends," he said, recalling the genesis of the show. "At the time, I had a 
folder of these parodies: 'Evita,' 'Amadeus,' 'The Pirates of Penzance,' '42nd 
Street.' Also at the time, I was mostly working as a performer, and wanted to 
showcase myself and my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 After several months of shaping the material, the two-person show debuted in 
January, 1982, at Palsson's Supper Club in New York. It was an instant hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, soon enlarged to a cast of four, later picked up the Obie, Drama 
Desk and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In September, 1988, the show moved to New 
York's Theatre East, where it ran until January, 1994. Productions have 
included a 1983 run at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles and ongoing tours, which 
have spanned London, Sydney and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The naughty-but-nice qualities are clearly one of the show's appeals. "We're 
pretty clean," said Alessandrini, who is directing the run in West Hollywood. 
"In this version, we have two four-letter words. We're spoofing David Mamet, 
and there was no way to get around it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other targets include Ethel Merman, Madonna, Mary Martin, Tommy Tune, Julie 
Andrews, Barbra Streisand (plugging her upcoming concert tour) and Michael 
Crawford (plugging his post-"Phantom" album). 
</P>
<P>
 From the oldies file, Robert Goulet hits the revival circuit in "Camelounge" 
and Carol Channing makes one more pass at "Hello, Dolly!" Over the years, 
Alessandrini estimates that between 200 to 300 numbers have revolved through 
the show; the current version uses 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the best of Broadway," he said. "For this production, I'm picking 
from 10 years of events -- the high points." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Boston to parents who loved opera, Alessandrini began performing early 
on in off-Broadway, summer stock companies and in tours. What eventually became 
New York's longest-running musical comedy revue was created when the 
actor-writer was 27 and, he acknowledged, "has been a very good gig. They say 
you can't make a living writing for the stage, but you can make a killing. 
Well, for me it's been the opposite. I didn't make a killing, but I have made a 
living for the last 12 years." Satirical Snippets

COMMUNITY NEWS: RESCUE RIDE; CROSS-COUNTRY CYCLISTS RAISING FUNDS TO AID 
BOSNIAN WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynne Barstow has no relatives in Bosnia -- she hasn't even traveled there. 
Disturbed by reports of rape and killings occurring under the Serbian 
ethnic-cleansing campaign, the 34-year-old flight attendant and Santa Monica 
resident decided to act .  
</P>
<P>
 Which explains why Barstow is one of 74 American, Canadian and Australian 
cyclists taking part in a 3,228-mile fund-raising ride from Disneyland in 
Anaheim to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The cyclists, who departed Monday and plan to reach Orlando on June 3, are 
raising money for a wide range of charities as part of the Southern Cross 
Bicycle Classic. Barstow is pedaling for the "I Am Your Witness Campaign," an 
effort to aid refugee women and children in the former Yugoslavia. Organized by 
Powerful Choices, a Seattle-based group, the campaign also seeks to educate the 
public about atrocities in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Before departing, Barstow raised $8,000 from friends and co-workers at Delta 
Airlines. She and the other cyclists are averaging 80 to 110 miles per day on 
the odyssey through southern states. A van is carrying food, bike gear and 
other belongings. Sleeping arrangements will range from hotels and gymnasiums 
to tents and beaches. In Phoenix, a Harley-Davidson club plans to give the 
cyclists a ride on a different kind of bike. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the "I Am Your Witness Campaign" has raised $36,000 with the combined 
efforts of the Women's Coalition Against Ethnic Cleansing, based in Los 
Angeles, said Kim Adams, administrative director of Powerful Choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is delivering funds to two refugee relief organizations in 
Zagreb, Croatia -- Kareta and Zena BiH. Kareta was formed four years ago to 
address sexual abuse, said Barstow, but has been helping survivors of rape and 
forced pregnancy during the conflict. Volunteers are setting up a rape 
information center and will offer a 24-hour hot line. Zena BiH, also known as 
Women of Bosnia-Herzegovina, provides outreach programs in Zagreb and is 
initiating services elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The bike tour will be the longest ever for Barstow, who has been a serious 
cyclist for two years and once took a three-week bicycling tour in China. To 
train for the ride to Orlando, she rode 150 miles a week and also swam and 
walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Barstow says she has no plans for another bicycle tour after she crosses the 
finish line in Florida. She does, however, hope one day to pedal across the 
former Yugoslavia after peace has been declared. 
</P>
<P>
 To donate funds to the "I Am Your Witness Campaign," contact Powerful Choices, 
c/o Lynne Barstow, P.O. Box 30918, Seattle, Wash., 98103, (206) 782-5662. D.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; STUDENTS SHAPE IDEAS TO COMBAT URBAN WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marker poised, Jim Muldaven stood at a flip chart and posed the million-dollar 
question to about 100 Crenshaw and Dorsey high school students: 
</P>
<P>
 What are the most pressing problems in your communities, and how would you 
solve them? 
</P>
<P>
 Before Muldaven finished speaking, hands went up and opinions flew from all 
corners of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of response was typical during the two-day symposium at UCLA, 
created to give South-Central Los Angeles teen-agers a forum to voice their 
opinions on urban issues and, more important, allow them to shape solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody focuses on gangs as being the main problem, but it's not just 
them," said Renisha Davis, 16, a Crenshaw sophomore. "There's a lot more to it 
than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Perspectives L.A. Youth Conference was co-sponsored by the 
university and Capitol Focus, a nonprofit organization that attempts to raise 
the political awareness of teen-agers and young adults in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldaven founded Capitol Focus and has conducted similar programs in seven 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids get to identify what issues they want to put their time and energy 
into," Muldaven said. "And they can't be as easily dismissed by politicians and 
other adults when they've really thought things through and come up with plans 
of action." 
</P>
<P>
 Muldaven piloted the Crenshaw-Dorsey project after meeting educator and 
community activist Celestine Palmer at a Capitol Focus conference in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, a Crenshaw resident and co-chair of the state Democratic Party's 
Woman's Caucus, organized a student committee that prepared the conference 
agenda. Palmer and the group christened themselves the Dorsey-Crenshaw Area 
Youth Action League, and she was named coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big issue here is youth disenfranchisement, and how to change it," said 
Palmer. "Kids don't want to hear adults speak. They need their own identity." 
</P>
<P>
 With a $75,000 grant, the Action League will be able to continue workshops and 
offer stipends for student league workers for at least two years. Muldaven has 
acquired some office equipment, and is seeking a Crenshaw-area space to house 
the league. ERIN J. AUBRY

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * HOME HEIGHT LIMIT: Approved an ordinance that lowers the maximum allowable 
height of a single-family home to 33 feet from 45 feet. However, if 40% or more 
of the existing single-family dwellings on the same street have heights 
exceeding 33 feet, the maximum height for the home shall be the average height 
of homes on that street.The main objectives of the ordinance include protecting 
street scapes from structures that are incompatible with surrounding houses and 
protecting the rights to privacy of neighboring properties. 
</P>
<P>
 * WATER RATES: Approved an ordinance that will lower water rates for 
high-volume water consumers between June 1 and Oct. 31. During that period, 
when more water is used than at any other time of year, the charge for water 
that exceeds the basic usage amount set by the city will be $2.33 per 100 cubic 
feet, rather than the $2.98 per 100 cubic feet charged last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET CLOSURE: Approved the temporary street closure of the westbound curb 
lane along Hollywood Boulevard, between Highland Avenue and Sycamore Avenue, on 
May 5 from 6 to 8 p.m. for a fund-raiser sponsored by AIDS Project L.A. at 
Mann's Chinese Theater. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * DEBRIS REMOVAL: Instructed the Board of Public Works to notify all 
demolition contractors of the option of disposing non-recyclable debris created 
by the Jan. 17 earthquake by railroad at the rate of $38.25 per ton. The waste 
would be loaded onto Southern Pacific rail cars and sent to a landfill in Utah.

COVER STORY; POLICE FORCE UNDER FIRE; UCLA'S 59-MEMBER DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS 
PEACE EVERYWHERE ON CAMPUS EXCEPT WITHIN ITS OWN RANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For almost two years, UCLA Police Officer Charles Harold has languished in 
administrative limbo, collecting his regular $3,600 monthly paycheck for doing 
. . . nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 His former partner, UCLA Officer Terrence Duren, has been paid $3,500 a month 
since October not to come to work. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man, Albert Melendy, who served for 10 years as a UCLA cop, has 
collected $1,300 a month in disability pay from the University of California 
system for a decade as a result of a legal settlement. What is his disability? 
</P>
<P>
 "They never said," Melendy replied. "Stress, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 All say they are willing and able to do their jobs, but have been kept from 
working in the University of California system because they filed grievances 
and in some cases lawsuits against the university alleging various forms of 
harassment and discrimination by the UCLA Police Department. In court papers, 
the university has generally denied any wrongdoing, but some of the allegations 
of sexual harassment raised by at least one officer have been upheld by UCLA's 
own fact-finding efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of the three officers, eyebrow-raising in its own right, only hints 
at the sour labor relations dogging the 47-year-old UCLA Police Department, a 
59-member force that patrols the 419-acre Westwood campus and the UCLA Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six other former and current employees have lawsuits pending against 
the department, and there are hints of more to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the complaints center around problems that may have existed 
for years, legal documents and other sources describe a dedicated but 
emotionally drained rank-and-file that perceives key supervisors as inept and 
unfair, particularly with regard to their treatment of minority workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Police Department troubles, the university reported last month 
that overall crime on the campus declined in 1993. The largest drop was in 
property crimes, which dipped from 1,626 incidents to 1,444. Violent assaults, 
however, soared from 31 reported incidents to 65. 
</P>
<P>
 There is concern that low morale and other problems could eventually lead to a 
deterioration in service. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing "decaying operations" and "a continuous lack of leadership," the union 
for campus police officers earlier this year directed a vote of no confidence 
against Karl Ross, acting chief since the retirement of John Barber last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all agree that his actions have fallen well short of his intended goals 
and do not believe in the direction he is guiding the department," the 
50-member University Peace Officer's Assn. said in a Feb. 28 letter to 
Administrative Vice Chancellor John Curry, who oversees the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross did not return phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Curry suggested that the no-confidence vote was fueled by several factors 
beyond Ross' control. Among them, he said, were fears of impending budget cuts, 
discontinuity caused by the retirement of the former chief, and frustration 
within the ranks with the slow pace of reforms promised by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The university is now evaluating a handful of finalists for the permanent 
chief's job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very aggressively going to work on the department in all the right 
ways," Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most visible sign of that effort was the recent hiring of an 
outside consultant, a move that Curry says was prompted in part by the 
no-confidence vote. The consultant is surveying and evaluating the entire 
Department of Community Safety, which includes parking, health and safety and 
fire prevention staff as well as police and student security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the consultant's survey obtained by The Times show a high level of 
dissatisfaction among police in virtually every job-related category. For 
example, on a 4-point scale in which 1 equals "definitely disagree" and 2 
equals "inclined to disagree," the statement "Communication from the 
Administration is Always Honest" produced an average score of 1.32 among 25 
respondents. "Internal Affairs are Conducted in an Ethical Manner" polled a 
1.42. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the department's labor disputes seem destined to be played out in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, three former civilian dispatchers have filed federal 
civil rights complaints against UCLA, alleging on-the-job sexual harassment and 
racial discrimination. Additionally, six officers, including Harold and Duren, 
have filed lawsuits in Santa Monica Superior Court against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Officer Harold is at the center of the storm, creating a veritable 
blizzard of grievances and court complaints against the university and openly 
helping other disgruntled colleagues do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 grievance, he accused then-Lt. James Vandenberg of repeatedly making 
offensive racial and ethnic jokes, bringing pornographic material into the 
station, and questioning the sexual orientation of one officer.  
</P>
<P>
 A university complaint resolution officer determined in a January, 1993, 
fact-finding report that the complaints had validity. Vandenberg, now a 
sergeant, declined to discuss any of the complaints against him, referring such 
questions to his attorney, Michael Stone, who could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandenberg, however, did take a generalized swipe at his attackers, 
categorizing roughly a third of the department as bad hires who "bounce from 
department to department and bring their baggage with them." 
</P>
<P>
 "The code of ethics is severely lacking with some of the people we have here," 
he said, adding, "It's time the people making the allegations were looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 Following up that grievance and others, Harold contended in a Santa Monica 
Superior Court lawsuit that he was branded a troublemaker by supervisors and 
his service record was smeared with phony violations. Finally, he was placed on 
paid leave until his complaints were resolved, a move he alleges has denied him 
promotional opportunities and caused him emotional pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the university have argued in court documents that the case, which 
has not gone to trial, should be thrown out, in part because the allegations 
are "uncertain and untelligible (sic)" and Harold has not yet exhausted all 
administrative remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold has accused the university of a "big stall game." 
</P>
<P>
 Employee grievances involve lengthy internal investigations and hearings and 
findings by university officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A university official acknowledged that one reason the grievance process is 
long and involved is to protect the institution from being dragged into 
countless costly court battles at the whims of disgruntled workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Lieban, who recently departed UCLA's Office of Insurance and Risk 
Management, told The Times before he left: "That has been part of our strategy. 
We approach every employment case that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Curry acknowledged that Harold's case, and perhaps that of several 
others, have dragged on for an "unconscionably long" time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the grievances have not been dealt with expeditiously, and I 
intend to speed (the process) up to get that resolved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold, now a private investigator, hopes it happens soon -- for his sake, he 
said, as well as that of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire me or put me back to work," he declared in an interview. "I really don't 
care, but make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold's former partner, Terrence Duren, is in a similar position. The 
eight-year veteran has been on indefinite paid leave since October. Duren said 
the leave resulted from an internal affairs investigation, in which he was 
accused of leaking to colleagues a confidential letter regarding a lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Duren denies leaking the letter and insists the accusation was leveled to 
punish him for suing the department. In his Santa Monica Superior Court suit 
filed last August, Duren, who is black, alleges that supervisors uttered and 
tolerated racial slurs in his presence, subjected him to "numerous acts of 
oppression, fraud and malice" and even dismissed him without cause temporarily 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The university maintained in court papers that there is no grounds for the 
suit, but did not offer a detailed response. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a comedy of errors at that place, and it's not the officers, it's the 
administrators," Duren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick McNicholas, the attorney representing all six of the officers who have 
filed complaints, says the convoluted cases are the result of inconsistent 
employee grievance and disciplinary procedures throughout the department. 
</P>
<P>
 For favored officers, say department insiders, even serious misconduct is 
overlooked; other officers are sometimes punished severely for minor 
transgressions -- or for speaking out. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatchers, two women and a black man, endured "everything from 
name-calling to cartoons on the wall to work assignments and performance 
evaluations based on sex and race," according to their attorney Patrick 
Thistle. 
</P>
<P>
 Thistle said two of the dispatchers were "driven out" of their jobs last year 
after they filed grievances against UCLA. "There was obvious retaliation 
against them for making complaints," he alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 A third dispatcher, Thistle claims in court documents, was fired after telling 
a supervisor she had retrieved information from a computer reserved for sworn 
personnel only, even though an officer gave her permission to do so. "The 
supervisor took the information, said 'thank you' and fired her." Thistle 
contends the computer incident was a set-up to give her bosses an excuse to 
fire her after it became clear she would not quit on her own. "We're alleging 
it was subterfuge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The university declined to comment on the cases, citing a policy against 
speaking about pending litigation. The dispatchers' cases are pending in 
federal court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Melendy's quarrel with the UC system never made it to court. He spoke out 
against alleged departmental abuses between 1970 and 1980, going so far as to 
help form the police association and ally it with a Teamsters local. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After spending 10 years as an officer at UCLA and another four at the 
University of California at Irvine, he filed a worker's compensation claim 
against the University of California system in 1983, alleging that supervisors 
at both campuses caused him "mental stress." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint charged that he was intimidated and harassed, routinely buried 
in paperwork, assigned tasks that were impossible to accomplish, then 
reprimanded for failing to perform his regular duties. For a four-year span at 
UCLA, he recalls, his responsibilities included investigating all property 
crimes, a figure numbering into the thousands annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible; you can't do it," he said. "I asked for help and the 
lieutenant in charge said, 'If you cannot carry five major cases in your head 
and at least 20 minor cases, you should not even be up here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His superiors ordered him to see a psychiatrist, who, Melendy says, concluded 
that he was indeed mentally fatigued and in need of some rest, but was 
otherwise healthy. Melendy found himself out of job shortly after he filed his 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The university settled his case for $30,000, plus $1,300 a month in long-term 
disability payments. "They bought my silence; that's what they did," said 
Melendy, now 53. 
</P>
<P>
 Melendy said he had hopes of returning to work but was never rehired and 
eventually moved to the Philippines where, he says, he spent eight years living 
as "a man of leisure, a gentleman" before returning to California last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not surprised by the recent crop of lawsuits and says favoritism is 
pervasive at the University of California police departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the UC campuses have a split (police) department," he said. "There 
are officers who are there to be promoted. They don't do much. Then you have 
the others, outsiders, older guys often, working for a living. They're the ones 
that take the heat off the other officers. You're there to draw fire, and 
that's all you're there for. When you draw too much, you're out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the recent history of the UCLA Police is the story of Barber, 
who headed the department from 1978 until his retirement last year at age 57. 
He is remembered as a colorful figure with a bent for salesmanship and 
innovation, but officers point out that the discord now afflicting the 
department stems largely from problems that occurred during his watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber is out of town and did not return phone calls left with a woman who 
answered his home phone. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous interviews, he has defended his role, saying he worked hard to 
recruit and promote minorities. He also has said that his retirement from the 
$87,000-a-year chief's job was unrelated to the litigation facing the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 His temporary successor, Ross, though less flamboyant than Barber, is seen by 
many department insiders as a representative of the old system. Under Ross, 
critics complain, a few key administrators have assumed slightly different job 
titles, but the politics and personalities of the department are essentially 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 That viewpoint was expressed in a Jan. 14 letter to Vice Chancellor Curry 
signed by 44 Police Department employees and written by Sgt. Rick Sanchez, a 
Latino whose 1993 lawsuit against UCLA alleges his career was thwarted on 
racial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department's reorganization has left the same close-minded department 
heads in positions of ultimate authority," Sanchez wrote. "These same 
individuals lack objectivity and discretion . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Morale has worsened in the past two months," he added, "because the 
department's restructuring hasn't offered any viable changes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The university's budget crisis hasn't helped. Aiming to cut costs by $86 
million between 1990 and 1995, UCLA plans to impose an 11% across-the-board cut 
in department budgets. Probable staff reductions have the entire university on 
edge, and the Police Department is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the litigants are cautiously hopeful that the police department 
consultant may bring change. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant, Paul Obney, declined to comment on his work, but Curry said he 
has been impressed by the early results, which show a "cadre of professional 
police officers who want to get moving" with improving the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some wonder how any department can operate safely and effectively in a 
highly stressful work environment.  
</P>
<P>
 "Someone's going to get hurt," Harold warned, comparing the workplace to the 
U.S. Postal Service, where several disgruntled workers have gone on shooting 
sprees in recent years. "People are tired of being put down all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Melendy no longer worries about such matters. Now working as a private 
investigator in Desert Hot Springs, he is about to start collecting his 
$1,400-a-month university retirement package, complete with full benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 He is philosophical about his truncated career as a campus cop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The University of California, especially UCLA, has one of the best schools of 
management in the world," he said. "But they don't send their own people to 
it." On the Cover

problems in the department. The university has disputed the claims in the 
lawsuits. Photo: Suzanne States.

HOMELESS: PROBLEM WARRANTS EXPLORING CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I think the heart of the disagreement between Mr. Dellinger and me is our 
different perception of the causes of homelessness. Every day I hear stories 
about people losing their jobs and/or their homes. After the earthquake, 
several Santa Monicans I know lost both. Yesterday, I heard of a man who used 
to administer rental properties, but whose job disappeared as more and more 
rental property owners did this work themselves under the pressure of the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 If these people did not have networks of affluent family and friends to depend 
upon, they would be homeless. Virtually every eager homeless person in Santa 
Monica whom I have questioned has been eager to tell his or her story, and all 
the stories begin, "I used to be a . . . " They have worked hard as factory 
workers, as social workers, and, of course, as servicemen and women in the 
United States armed forces. Their jobs disappeared because the plant or 
business downsized or went out of business, the library or school had to cut 
its staff, automation made a set of skills and experiences redundant. 
</P>
<P>
 The stereotyping of homeless people is especially unfair and unfortunate as it 
impacts homeless families. Children are the future, and by regarding homeless 
people as people who have simply made "bad choices" we undercut the self-esteem 
of young people who haven't been in a position to make any choices. We also 
undercut their respect for their parents -- parents who are desperate to do 
right by their children. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not mean to "distort the issue." Rather, I was arguing that we need to 
inform ourselves more fully about the causes of homelessness and about how best 
to address the phenomenon. I would urge that a responsible census be taken that 
could tell us as a community what skills there are, what problems, what ages, 
genders and needs, among those people in Santa Monica who do not have homes. As 
Nancy Hill-Holtzman pointed out in her March 31 article ("Council to Open 
Shelter for Homeless") estimates of the number of homeless people in Santa 
Monica seem to oscillate wildly. We (and I include homeless people in that 
'we') need a detailed picture so that as a community we can come up with 
sensible, constructive, realistic responses -- not panic. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure Mr. Dellinger has heard of the Great Depression. Perhaps, like mine, 
some of his family were homeless during some of those years. Perhaps, like me, 
he feels passionately about the situation because he does understand that it 
can happen to anyone.

FOR SENIORS; IRV WERSHOW IS AN UNSUNG HERO FOR BLIND YOUNGSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irv Wershow is not a star. He doesn't even want to shine. When he talks about 
himself, it's in relation to others. It's always "we." He is steady, reliable, 
loyal, uncomplicated and compassionate. Even the people whose lives he has 
enriched for 40 years wouldn't recognize him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wershow, 80, and his friends founded the Guiders, an organization that drives 
blind children to recreational activities and raises funds for the Foundation 
for the Junior Blind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guiders began with Wershow doing a favor for a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a group of 12 couples and we decided to do something for charity. One 
of our friends introduced us to Norm Kaplan, the founder of the Foundation for 
the Junior Blind, who asked if we could drive blind children to recreational 
activities. None of us had a blind child, but we wanted to do something. And 
that's how it all started," Wershow recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 They began selling raffle tickets for a dollar each to raise money. Their 
first big fund-raising project was raffling tickets for the premiere of "The 
Diary of Anne Frank," and every year for 40 years they have turned over money 
to the foundation. Those dollars add up to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guiders has become Wershow's second family. "The only time we parted was 
when people passed. Now I'm the only man left, with three of the original 
women. And the Guiders still keeps us together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Wershow, who still visits the foundation center every week, it's the 
satisfaction he gets by being active and seeing the difference in children's 
lives. "Everybody should come and see it for themselves. Blind children playing 
baseball, bowling. It makes me feel great that there's something like this to 
contribute to," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Siegel's daughter, Laura, 12, has cataracts. When Laura was 9, Julie 
took her to Camp Bloomfield. Located on 40 acres in the mountains above Malibu, 
the foundation's camp serves blind, visually impaired, and multiply disabled 
blind children and their families. Guider dollars helped build it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a child with a special problem, you don't walk away as easily. 
I remember taking Laura to Camp Bloomfield for the first time. It was scary at 
first to let go of a child you've been protecting, but it was the most caring 
and loving environment, and she had the most positive experience of her life," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura attends public school near her West Los Angeles home. After school, she 
goes to one of the six recreational programs the foundation offers. 
</P>
<P>
 In regular school, Laura said, she feels as if she's trying to keep up, but at 
the foundation she feels as if she's one of the best. This summer she'll go 
back to Camp Bloomfield for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't any summer camp for Wershow when he was a child. The son of 
Russian immigrants, he grew up in New York during the Depression. Hard work and 
a spare life were the rule. When he married his wife, Mimi, in 1938, they came 
to California for a honeymoon and never went back. 
</P>
<P>
 He practiced the meat-cutting trade he learned from his father and eventually 
opened the Palm Terrace, a catering hall in Fairfax. He worked seven days a 
week, plus nights. The Guiders had their meetings there. 
</P>
<P>
 Wershow and his friends had no idea that the Guiders would be their legacy. 
Although Mimi died a few years ago, Irv carries on. Every time he mentions her 
name, he says: "May she rest in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I did in my life she had a hand in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's part of that generation that is predictable and consistent. The 
generation that believed in the Golden Rule and practiced it. When the other 
members of the Guiders presented him with a birthday cake, he shared half of it 
with his friends and brought the rest to the foundation to share with the 
children. Programs for Blind Children 
</P>
<P>
 The Foundation for the Junior Blind is a nonprofit agency established in 1953 
to meet the recreational needs of blind children. Last year it served more than 
4,000 children. Its Infant-Family Program provides home-based early 
intervention for children up to age 3. The foundation runs a state-certified 
special education school, a children's residential center and a vocational 
independence program for adults. The foundation has a seven-acre campus at 5300 
Angeles Vista Blvd., Los Angeles. Information: (213) 295-4555.

KAREN SILKWOOD CASE RETURNS TO HAUNT PARENTS; WHISTLE-BLOWER: THE DISCLOSURE 
THAT LOS ALAMOS LAB HAS HAD HER BONE FRAGMENTS SINCE 1974 OUTRAGES FAMILY. A 
WORKER IN A PLUTONIUM-PROCESSING PLANT, SHE DIED IN A CAR CRASH WHILE ON HER 
WAY TO MEET A REPORTER. SHE HAD PROMISED TO BRING PROOF THE PLANT WAS UNSAFE; 
NO DOCUMENTS WERE IN THE CAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA TOLLEY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost 20 years have passed since plutonium plant whistle-blower Karen 
Silkwood died in a car crash on an Oklahoma highway, but her father can't put 
her mysterious death behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Bill Silkwood wanted to let go of the past, events won't let him. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned recently that Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico had 
several bone fragments left behind from post-mortem testing done on his 
28-year-old daughter, who thought she had been contaminated with radioactive 
plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab wanted to know what the family wished to do with the remains. Silkwood 
is furious that the lab still has them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to have it," he said, his voice filled with anger. "I want 
it all. . . . It's the remains of what they did to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had no business taking her body in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest disclosure has renewed the pain and frustration Silkwood and his 
wife, Merle, have endured since the 1974 accident killed their oldest daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had gotten better until this happened," said Merle Silkwood, choking back 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Silkwood, union activist and a lab-analyst for Kerr-McGee Corp. at its 
plutonium processing plant near Crescent, Okla., died Nov. 13, 1974, while 
driving to meet a reporter for the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 She had promised to bring evidence proving the plant was unsafe. No documents 
were found in the wrecked car. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family and union officials contended she was forced off the road, but 
Oklahoma Highway Patrol officials concluded she fell asleep at the wheel after 
taking sedatives. The Justice Department said there was insufficient evidence 
to prove the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Her story later became the movie "Silkwood," starring Meryl Streep and Cher. 
</P>
<P>
 Silkwood, 69, still is convinced someone killed his daughter, and he has a 
standing $10,000 reward out for information leading to an arrest and conviction 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe somebody who had been involved would come forward," he said. 
No one has. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Los Alamos lab, site of government nuclear research since World War 
II, Silkwood is seeking legal advice before he crafts a response about the 
remaining bones. He also wants 113 vials of tissue samples from his daughter 
that he believes the lab still has. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Silkwood was buried in the east Texas town of Kilgore after an autopsy 
was performed in Oklahoma. Some of her organs, including her brain, were 
removed and taken to the Los Alamos lab for additional testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lab officials insist they did so with the family's permission, but Silkwood 
disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're liars. We only gave them permission to do an autopsy (in Oklahoma). 
That had nothing to do with stripping her body organs out" and taking them to 
Los Alamos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silkwood said the family didn't find out that her organs had been removed and 
taken to Los Alamos until 1979, during the trial of a lawsuit filed against 
Kerr-McGee. (The company later agreed to pay his daughter's estate $1.38 
million.) 
</P>
<P>
 The family didn't know about the bones until this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel now like I felt back during the trial, and that's pretty dad-gum 
rough," Silkwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Silkwood has spent his own time and money in his search for 
answers about his daughter's death. He said he has lost a lot of his trust in 
people along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 But he can't give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to continue as long as there's a chance. There's always a chance," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silkwood continues to talk about his daughter as he walks outside the home in 
Nederland, the southeastern Texas town where he and his wife reared their three 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 She was just a regular girl, he said. She played the flute, made good grades, 
married, had three children and got a job at a nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew she was concerned about safety at the plant. She had called just a few 
days before her death to say she was quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 She was coming home to Texas.

STUDENTS' INQUIRY ABOUT WITCHCRAFT ALL BUT TIES LIBRARY AIDE TO STAKE; MONTANA: 
WORKER FIRED FOR LENDING SEVENTH-GRADE GIRLS TWO OF HER OWN BOOKS THAT SCHOOL 
SUPERINTENDENT FOUND WERE "GROSSLY INAPPROPRIATE." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The two seventh-graders wanted to do a report on witchcraft, and they asked 
library aide Debbie Denzer for her help. She steered them to the encyclopedias, 
and lent them two books of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 That was her mistake, say her bosses. No, she says -- that was her job. 
</P>
<P>
 Denzer was fired in January for providing the girls with material that Frank 
de Kort, superintendent of the rural district in northwest Montana, described 
as "grossly inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 One book contained graphic descriptions, drawings and photographs about 
witchcraft and Satanic rituals involving sex acts, mutilations and sacrificial 
killings. The other discussed sexual matters, and included nude drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 Denzer contends there is no written policy on such loans and, without one, she 
would be professionally obligated to do the same thing again. 
</P>
<P>
 She is appealing her firing to the county school superintendent, who is 
expected to rule in mid-May; nonetheless, she does not expect to get her job 
back, or find a job anywhere nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 She has accumulated some powerful allies: "We basically believe that if a 
child can understand the material given to them, they're ready for it," said 
Judith Krug, head of the American Library Assn.'s Office for Intellectual 
Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Other supporters include the American Civil Liberties Union, the National 
Council of Teachers of English, the National Coalition Against Censorship, and 
PEN American Center, a writers' organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of burning Debbie Denzer at the stake, the school authorities fired 
her for 'unsatisfactory performance' and 'misconduct,' " wrote a supporter, 
author Alice Hoffman, in an Op-Ed piece in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are critics as well. Almost everyone except Denzer -- even her 
solitary defender at school, librarian Joan Gates -- agrees the books were 
"inappropriate" for 12- and 13-year-old girls. A letter supporting Denzer's 
dismissal was signed by 20 out of 21 teachers at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a troubling case in a lot of ways, obviously," said Mike Dahlem, 
attorney for the Montana School Boards Assn. "If this right of the employees is 
upheld, what limitation can be placed on importation of graphic materials? 
There doesn't seem to be any limitation." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a case of an honest mistake made by a well-intentioned employee," 
Dahlem argued at Denzer's appeal hearing. "It is a case of open defiance to the 
adopted policies of the board of trustees." 
</P>
<P>
 But Denzer's lawyer, Dan Johns, responded that the board fired her for 
violating a policy that does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 She "crossed a line in the sand that caused her to be fired," he said. "The 
problem is, the line wasn't drawn until she was on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, librarian at West Valley for 13 years, said Denzer was a valuable 
assistant and did not deserve firing. Denzer has extensive knowledge of 
children's literature and often brought students books from home or from the 
Kalispell public library, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates thinks if Denzer had reviewed these books she would have decided 
they were inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 The books -- "The Devil and All His Works," by Dennis Wheatley, and "Not in 
God's Image: Women in History from the Greeks to the Victorians," edited by 
Julia O'Faolain and Lauro Martines -- date from Denzer's college years. 
</P>
<P>
 Denzer, 40, said she had forgotten the contents. She said she passed them 
along only because the indexes showed references to the girls' topic, 
witchcraft. She cautioned the two girls not to show them to other students. 
</P>
<P>
 "These girls were both bright and mature, and I felt sure they could handle 
it," Denzer said. "I knew that some other kids in school could not, so I told 
them not to show them around." 
</P>
<P>
 She apologized to the parents of one of the girls -- "I, too, am appalled by 
the contents of the book, and I am horrified that such a book would be read by 
children because of me, especially after I did examine it" -- a few days after 
they complained. But she later recanted, citing emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were their words, not mine," Denzer says now. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of both girls say their daughters were greatly upset -- not by the 
books, which they barely glimpsed -- but by the thought that they might have 
caused Denzer's firing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, they wrote their papers about bison.

THIS RABBIT TEST SUGGESTS GLAUCOMA RELIEF FOR HUMANS; MEDICINE: TINY DISC 
PLACED ON EYES LOWERS FLUID PRESSURE, WHICH CAN DAMAGE THE OPTIC NERVE AND LEAD 
TO BLINDNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A tiny disc placed on the eyes of rabbits released a substance that lowered 
the fluid pressure inside their eyeballs, suggesting a possible new approach to 
treating glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
 In glaucoma, which affects perhaps 3 million Americans age 40 and over, 
excessive fluid pressure in the eye can damage the optic nerve and lead to 
blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cases are treated with eye drops. But they can cause side effects, 
patients do not always take them, and they eventually stop working in many 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 If drugs fail, doctors can use a scalpel or laser to make a tiny hole that 
lets excess fluid leak out. But that hole can become plugged or heal up, ending 
the procedure's effectiveness, and making a hole carries risks of surgical 
complications, said researcher Dr. Jacob Dan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the experimental procedure, an enzyme released by the disc thins the white 
of the eye underneath. That lets fluid drain through the tissue without 
creating a major hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan, with Arieh Yaron of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, 
reports the work in the March issue of the journal Ophthalmology. Dan is 
affiliated with the institute and the California Pacific Medical Center in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan said human experiments are expected to begin soon, but he stressed that it 
is not yet clear whether the disc will work in people. Even if it does work, it 
will be years until it could be widely available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ophthalmology article reported results in 15 rabbits without glaucoma. In 
each animal, the fluid pressure of the two eyes was virtually the same before 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers applied the disc, which was less than one-third the size of a 
small hard contact lens, to one eye in each animal under local anesthesia. The 
disc did not disturb eye movement or blinking for the four hours it was in 
place, Dan said. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, an enzyme called collagenase released from the disc thinned 
the tissue below by more than three-fourths its original width, researchers 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure in the treated eyes was initially reduced by 40% to 60% below that of 
the untreated eyes. The reduction narrowed to about 20% from the 10th through 
the 30th day after the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect lasted more than twice as long as has been seen with surgical 
treatment in rabbits, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 No side effects were seen, other than some slight and temporary irritation 
where the disc had been applied, Dan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is promising and exciting," commented Dr. Eve Higginbotham, an associate 
professor of ophthalmology at the University of Michigan's Medical School in 
Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But she cautioned that its effectiveness in people is not known, and that the 
technique would have to be refined before it could be useful in most patients.

PROPOSED HOMELESS HOUSING AT AIR FORCE BASE TURNS INTO BATTLEGROUND; DENVER: 
MANY OF LOWRY'S NEIGHBORS FEAR CRIME RATES WILL RISE, PROPERTY VALUES WILL 
DECLINE AND NEIGHBORHOODS WILL DETERIORATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Denver's homeless need shelter; Lowry Air Force Base -- slated for closing -- 
has housing to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 To advocates for the homeless, it is a perfect match. But to thousands of 
property owners, it is more like a nightmare, and they're waging a battle that 
is more heated than anything the base has seen in its 57 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing's like what we've run into in Denver," said John Carr, program 
manager for the Air Force Base Conversion Agency, which is coordinating the 
closure of bases for the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowry's neighbors want a say in how their area develops. Many are afraid a 
concentration of homeless will cause crime rates to rise, property values to 
decline and neighborhoods to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people in our area are humanistic. Most of us contribute quite 
heavily to charities, including homeless providers," said Julie Mackay, who 
co-chairs United Neighborhoods Organization, a coalition of Lowry-area 
homeowner associations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do stop short of giving up our homes and our neighborhoods. A lot of the 
neighbors feel like they are being asked to give more and more and more . . . 
they don't feel that's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that Denver has a homeless problem; the Colorado 
Coalition for the Homeless estimates the number of homeless families increased 
88.5% between 1990 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Its statistics indicate an average of 477 families -- about 1,378 individuals 
-- stayed in Denver shelters on a given night last year. That excludes single 
people and families who sought help privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Providers of housing for the homeless have top priority for surplus government 
property -- like base housing -- under the 1987 McKinney Act. So when the 
government announced it was closing Lowry, they saw their opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its opening in 1937, Lowry has been a formidable presence. 
</P>
<P>
 It sprawls across 1,863 acres on the border of Denver and its suburb, Aurora. 
In 1967, the Air Force closed its airstrip and dedicated the base to education; 
this year, about 21,000 students attend classes at Lowry, where 11,000 military 
personnel and civilians hold jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 An eclectic mix of residential and commercial developments surround the base, 
ranging from $20,000 one-story brick homes to sprawling residences on 
tree-lined boulevards that are worth more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Neighborhoods Organization, representing these areas, proposed that 
a maximum of 32 of Lowry's 867 housing units be reserved for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of citizens and government representatives went further. As part of 
their overall base-redevelopment plan (a 187-acre educational campus, 538 acres 
for housing, 36 acres for community services and more than 400 acres of 
recreation and open space), they recommended that the homeless get a maximum of 
86 units and 87 dorm rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 But homeless advocates wanted more, and it seems they may get it. Tentatively, 
the Air Force has approved 196 units. 
</P>
<P>
 A final decision is expected from the Air Force in June, but meanwhile, 
tempers are flaring. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the hatred is the worst I've seen," said Denver City Councilwoman 
Polly Flobeck. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents have packed public hearings; letters representing both sides of the 
issue have appeared in the newspapers. Property owners have pledged to take 
their case to congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, attorney Tom Hames and some colleagues are researching legal 
issues to determine if there is a basis for a lawsuit. They also are raising 
money to help finance a lawsuit if the debate reaches that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not opposed to the homeless being located at Lowry. We will accept our 
fair share and probably a little bit more because we recognize it as a 
problem," he said. "We are opposed to the base being used as a magnet for those 
who were down on their luck." 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates like John Parvensky, director of the Colorado Coalition for the 
Homeless, are trying to calm their angry adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot of fear and ignorance of not knowing what we're 
proposing or what the situations of these types of families are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're focusing in these programs on families, those who are truly motivated 
to make a difference in their lives. . . . It doesn't do any good to place 
families in an environment that is destructive or debilitating."

SIMPLE DISLIKE ISN'T A REASON FOR RECALL; * RECENT EFFORTS ARE WRONGLY 
MOTIVATED BY SINGLE ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recall mania that has swept Orange County in recent years unfortunately 
shows no sign of abating. Recall is a justifiable weapon against elected 
officeholders convicted of crimes or clearly unable to perform their jobs due 
to mental or physical disability. But it too often has been used simply because 
one group does not like one politician or another. 
</P>
<P>
 This month the Anaheim Police Assn. voted to begin a recall effort against 
Mayor Tom Daly. The police union president accused Daly of not supporting 
public safety in the city, and contended the mayor was spending too much time 
trying to keep the Los Angeles Rams football team in Anaheim and negotiating 
with the Walt Disney Co. over its expansion in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly contended that he was on the side of the police -- what politician is 
going to proclaim himself against public safety? -- and said the action was a 
fallout of tough negotiations between the city and union over pay raises for 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 In Westminster, the firefighters' union is spearheading the recall of three 
City Council members and the mayor, a reaction against last year's council 
passage of a plan to reform the Fire Department in an effort to cut costs. The 
Westminster city clerk estimated the cost of putting the recall on the June 
ballot at $40,000. If the recall is successful, a special election will be 
required, at additional cost. Worse, the extra balloting would gain only 
months: two of the council seats are on the ballot in November; so is that of 
the mayor, who serves only a two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true in Fullerton, where the terms of two of the three council 
members targeted for recall in June expire at the end of this year. The duo and 
a third councilman voted to increase a utility tax. The city clerk was targeted 
for allegedly delaying the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and fire unions throughout the county traditionally have been potent 
political forces, and politicians eagerly solicit their endorsements. But the 
time to register favor or disfavor with elected officials, absent such things 
as criminal activity or disability, is at regularly scheduled elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Without judging the merits of the underlying claims for and against Daly or in 
Westminster or Fullerton, the recall campaigns are motivated by single-issue 
politics. Politicians have a broad array of constituents to serve, not just 
special-interest groups. When anyone upset with one decision launches a recall 
campaign, it makes a mockery of government. This is a representative democracy; 
things are too complex to submit every single issue to a public referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 In fewer than four years, there have been nearly two dozen recall attempts in 
the county aimed at council people or school board members. That is far too 
many, even though the overwhelming majority failed to get on the ballot and 
none passed. 
</P>
<P>
 But even when they fail, recall attempts divert the attention of targeted 
officeholders. Rather than concentrate on the issues at hand, politicians must 
spend excessive time justifying their actions and raising funds to battle their 
foes. Fund raising takes far too much time for far too many politicians in the 
regular election cycles; forcing officeholders to solicit donations before 
their time is worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections are expensive for the public, too, especially if they occur when 
no other local race is on the ballot, as in Westminster in June. The threshold 
for recall elections should be higher than simple dislike of one or two 
decisions. Save a potent weapon for use when really needed.

IT'S WISE TO MOVE SLOWLY ON RAIL DECISION; * FULLERTON-IRVINE TRANSIT LINE 
COULD COST $2 BILLION TO BUILD, MILLIONS TO OPERATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sense of romance surrounding rail travel always was obvious on 
long-distance trains with melodious names like "20th Century Limited" or "City 
of New Orleans." Even on Amtrak trains from San Juan Capistrano to Los Angeles 
there is a feeling you do not get in a car or on a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are more practical parts of train travel, too, such as conductors' 
salaries and the cost of the iron and steel for the track and the cars. The 
financial questions surrounding the possibility of new urban train service are 
a key concern for the Orange County Transportation Authority, which fortunately 
has resisted getting carried away with the romance of the rails. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA this month approved a study of a proposed transit corridor between 
Fullerton and Irvine. The corridor is 28 miles long and six miles wide, and the 
study should help decide if it would be best served by rail, bus or nothing at 
all. OCTA officials estimated that a rail transit system in the corridor could 
cost $2 billion, a hefty price. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority has collected about $340 million for urban rail travel from the 
proceeds of a half-cent sales tax increase approved by county voters in 1990. 
But there is no need to spend that money cavalierly. If the rail corridor does 
not pencil out, don't build it. 
</P>
<P>
 County residents wisely have asked to see the price tag on a new mass-transit 
system. A recent telephone survey of 600 registered voters found that 71% 
favored construction of a Fullerton-Irvine rail line. However, when they were 
told the line could cost from $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion to build, and $10 
million to $15 million a year to operate, there was a steep drop to 49% in the 
percentage of those favoring the project. Another 39% disapproved the line at 
that cost, and 12% had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, the OCTA board chairman, registered the right 
note in suggesting that officials "move ahead cautiously" with the study. The 
research is necessary to apply for federal funding if a rail line is considered 
the best option. The study is likely to begin in August and take about two 
years to finish. Local officials will not know if the federal government 
approves the project until after the research is done. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton also had good suggestions for future survey 
questions, including how many people might use rail for daily commutes and how 
many simply would switch from buses to trains. A new urban rail line is far in 
the future, if it comes at all, but OCTA is off to a good, if appropriately 
cautious start.

BAD BUILDERS NEED FIXING, NOT THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A recent column ("The Litigation Epidemic Is Killing Off Affordable 
Housing," April 17) by a lobbyist for the housing industry proposes 
restrictions on construction defect lawsuits. The law does not need correction. 
The irresponsible builder does. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '80s, shoddy and dangerous building practices were commonplace. As 
a construction defect lawyer, I have seen many buildings that were damaged in 
the recent earthquake because required safety protection was missing. Fires 
often reveal similar dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 When defects, often life-threatening, appear, the developer, not the innocent 
homeowner, should pay for the repair. Built right the first time, safety costs 
pennies; after the fact, repairs can be costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most developers will make only minor repairs voluntarily. Homeowners 
associations usually sue only after getting the run-around from the developer. 
Insurance companies do not pay large settlements unless costly repairs are 
required, trial is approaching, the developer is at fault, and the homeowners' 
lawyer can prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a boy, I used to play with Roger down the street. Roger had the 
habit, when he was losing a game, of trying to change the rules. The building 
industry is like Roger. Now that careless building practices are becoming 
costly, the industry wants to change the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-consumer legislation (Dwight) Hansen proposes will not create safe, 
affordable housing. It will shield those who build defective homes by creating 
more technical hurdles for homeowners who seek their day in court, and more 
division within associations. 
</P>
<P>
 This industry should play by the same rules as everyone else. Instead of 
changing these rules, it should work to reform the rogues in its ranks.

 * Re: the "Commentary on Insurance," (April 17), the commentary is both timely 
and accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 As an architect/construction expert, I've been retained by numerous insurance 
companies and attorneys to provide investigation and analysis of 
plaintiff-homeowner's allegations of construction defects, which are frequently 
found to be without merit. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance companies settle these cases, more frequently than not, for 
substantial cash payments, leaving the defense analysis unrepresented due to 
the cost effectiveness of avoiding trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediation is one solution. But only when insurance companies establish, as a 
normal procedure, their willingness to mount a strong and winning defense will 
the litigation epidemic be abated.

THE ARROGANCE AND KINDNESS OF ARGYROS, JOHNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read your excellently researched article, "Duo Brings Personalities to 
Bear on O.C. Base Issue" (April 17). 
</P>
<P>
 Why do I get the completely unsettling feeling that I no longer live in the 
United States, but in a banana republic somewhere with an oligarchy, namely 
Buck Johns and George Argyros, who, with their unlimited money, control the 
lives of ordinary people who never elected them in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 Why do people, whose lives are tied up in the homes and businesses that would 
be ruined if an international airport is put in El Toro, permit this utter 
arrogance to exist by going along in any way with these people and their 
followers? 
</P>
<P>
 I have heard reports that they are using high-pressure people who are 
promising 21,000 new jobs if they sign their petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns and Argyros are in for a fight from the people who proved in the last 
election that money doesn't control everything, and that Orange County is still 
in the United States!

 * As I read the Times story on Buck Johns, I recalled my first meeting with 
Buck. I was at a private home in Huntington Beach to hear then-Republican 
primary candidate Bruce Herschensohn, who was making his first bid for public 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 I was new to Orange County politics and didn't know anyone who was at the 
event. While I was busy blending in with the wallpaper, I was approached by a 
friendly smile and an outstretched hand. Behind both was Buck Johns. We talked 
for about five minutes, and he then insisted on introducing me to several 
attendees, after which he introduced me to Herschensohn. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Buck and I go on to be bosom buddies? No. It was just a simple act of 
kindness to a stranger. I think it says a lot about the nature of Buck Johns.

FAIR DEAL FOR THOSE WHO HOLD YARD SALES; * SANTA ANA'S PLAN TO LIMIT THEM TO 4 
DESIGNATED WEEKENDS A YEAR IS PRACTICAL, FLEXIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana has approached the awkward problem of yard sales run amok with a 
good measure of reason and flexibility. On most weekends, driveways and empty 
parking lots are filled with racks of clothing and appliances, and neighborhood 
streets become congested with traffic and pedestrians. City Council members and 
neighborhood association activists have complained mightily, and code 
enforcement officials have acknowledged that, given the holding of between 300 
and 500 garage sales on any given weekend day around town, it is impossible to 
enforce the existing law. It allows only two garage sales a year per address, 
but the obvious problem is monitoring for compliance on a basis that is so site 
specific. The open disregard for the law provides sufficient answer: There is 
no way. 
</P>
<P>
 The city initially proposed a revised ordinance that would allow yard sales on 
only four weekends a year, twice in May and twice in October. But there were 
legitimate concerns about people who might want to hold garage sales to move. 
Why penalize them? So last week, the council endorsed an alternate plan and 
will take it up again next month. It would limit garage sales to four 
designated weekends each year, which effectively should provide an ample window 
every three months for those moving. 
</P>
<P>
 The yard sales do provide an opportunity for those who can't afford prices at 
most stores or who are without cars to buy and sell necessities without having 
to get to swap meets. But it is a different matter when neighborhoods are 
regularly transformed into bazaars. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulation will provide legitimate opportunity for yard sales 
periodically. It will also channel business activities into commercial areas, 
where they belong. 
</P>
<P>
 It deserves support. Santa Ana appears to have fashioned an approach that is 
fair and allows for popular yard sales to continue, but one that keeps 
neighborhoods from becoming swap meets.

NEW PITCHES FOR USE OF EL TORO MCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Here's an idea to solve some of Orange County's most pressing problems at 
once. Use the El Toro Air Base to build a new state-of-the-art ballpark for the 
Angels a la Baltimore's successful Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting would be beautiful with the Saddleback Mountains towering over the 
outfield. Pay for it with a countywide tax on alcohol and cigarettes. It has 
been done elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Anaheim could refurbish the "Big A" to keep the Rams and make it a better 
stadium for football fans. Just the construction alone on these projects would 
pump up the economy for North and South County alike. 
</P>

<P>
 * Re: The final solution for the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station: As the 
countless suggestions and ideas are being considered, there is one very 
predictable course of action, some might eventually say a course of no action. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately designate the Irvine City Council as the supreme administrator 
over El Toro MCAS. The City Council will immediately hold countless meetings, 
while putting various city departments in charge to coordinate all the 
activities at all the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way the council will vote for many options and at subsequent 
meetings will vote to change the votes at the previously held meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council and city bureaucrats "own the process," so whatever citizens' 
suggestions are put forth will be overruled by a city-hired outside 
guru-expert, who will only attend the one meeting that he conducts. The outside 
guru-expert will then put forth a consensus by having citizens do pencil 
drawings and finger paintings while searching for the best possible plan. The 
so called consensus is actually the dictate of the outside guru-expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason this is such an excellent plan: While all the countless meetings 
are being held, absolutely nothing will happen. The El Toro MCAS will just lie 
fallow and rot, with no jails, no airport, no housing development. 
</P>
<P>
 The very best part is that all the meeting activity will only take at least 10 
years to provide no decisions and hence absolutely no problems! This time 
projection is verified by the City Council's and city bureaucrats' previous and 
present track record. 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens of Northwood, especially the ones living along the abandoned 
railroad right-of-way, will be most pleased to let you know what 10 years of 
City Council meetings have provided for Northwood. Namely a number of 
frustrated citizens who some day might get off their couches and get rid of 
Irvine's incumbent politicians like Tustin did in their last election.

DON'T CATER TO LAST-MINUTE TAX FILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Tax Time Tribulations," April 15: I see that the U.S. post offices in 
both Orange and Los Angeles counties provided special service for those filing 
last-minute tax returns by remaining open in some cases until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 As a responsible citizen, I find this unfair to the millions of other 
law-abiding and punctual citizens of this area. 
</P>
<P>
 With the price of postage on a steady rise, and the cost in overtime pay and 
other operating budget expenses, I feel that it is unfair to the majority of 
taxpayers to support those persons who are either too negligent or too selfish 
in filing their returns (at the last minute). This is just another I reason why 
the cost of public services is constantly on the upswing.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: BRAZELTON GIVES CARE THAT'S PEDIATRICALLY CORRECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He walks into the room and grown women with babies in their arms swoon. His 
piercing, pale blue eyes fix you in a gaze that is so compassionate, so loving 
and understanding that women just want to melt. 
</P>
<P>
 Or run away with him . . . bringing the children, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he begins to talk in his slight Waco twang and he says things you've 
dreamed of hearing from other men:  
</P>
<P>
 "Child care is not just a woman's issue, it's a man's issue, too, and we need 
men to be included." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "I think women are the stronger sex; the trouble is, we are pushing them 
so hard right now to perform both jobs (parenting and working) that we haven't 
given them the backup they need." 
</P>
<P>
 And: "Parenting today is so much harder than it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 T. Berry Brazelton: every mother's dream date. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brazelton, the 75-year-old pediatrician, Harvard professor emeritus, 
best-selling author, cable TV star and child development guru, was in town 
recently to promote the paperback edition of his most recent book, 
"Touchpoints." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I jumped at the chance to meet him, just as I jumped at the chance to 
have my daughter sit on his lap because -- pediatrically speaking -- you just 
don't get closer to God than that. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept behind "Touchpoints" is that every developmental leap is 
accompanied by a temporary regression. Or, as Brazelton writes: "Those 
predictable times that occur just before a surge of rapid growth in any line of 
development -- motor, cognitive or emotional -- when, for a short time the 
child's behavior falls apart." The book is aimed at helping parents recognize 
those moments and avoid falling apart along with their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazelton is, as they say, a usual suspect, often rounded up by Washington 
pols whenever they want to make a point about children.  
</P>
<P>
 His research was critical in the formulation of the Family Leave Act, vetoed 
by President George ("Family Values") Bush and signed into law by President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a member of the National Commission on Children, which issued a report 
in 1991 about the crisis facing American children and families -- particularly 
those living in poverty. Its conclusions -- that the United States needs a 
strong pro-child policy instead of rhetoric -- were strongly echoed by a report 
released two weeks ago to much fanfare by the Carnegie Corp. Which means not 
much has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are some deep-seated biases in this country that keep us from 
looking at what we are doing to families," Brazelton said. "One is that we 
think families ought to be self-sufficient and they ought to suffer if they 
aren't. That makes us do things like welfare, which is sick ! 
</P>
<P>
 "The second thing is we all feel that women ought to be home with their kids 
and if they aren't, the kids are gonna suffer. And the third is, we don't like 
failure and we don't like poor people, so we're not gonna really do anything to 
help them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But biases only operate if you don't understand them. The second you 
understand them, you have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, the line of mothers and babies snaking out 
the back door may not have rivaled the crowd drawn by shock jock Howard Stern, 
but the passion was more deeply felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't enough good words to describe him," said Jody Yoxsimer, a City 
Hall budget analyst who brought 8-month-old Julianne to meet the good doctor. 
"His advice is so on the mark. His manner is so comforting." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has such a soothing voice," said Steve Morgan, a food broker, father of 
2-year-old Jennifer and one of the only men in the vicinity. "My wife watches 
him religiously. He reminds me of my own pediatrician when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazelton seems never to have met a parent he couldn't stand. And that, I 
think, is why parents love him so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he explained, "this started when I was 5 years old, with my own 
mother, who was a wonderful lady. She set up the first abortion clinic in Texas 
in 1940! I had a younger brother and -- I don't know how I got spared -- but he 
was the target for all of her anxiety. And she would just sit by him hour after 
hour trying to push food into him, and if he wouldn't eat it, she would put it 
into the icebox and take it back out and start all over again the next time. 
And I could see, even at the age of 5, that this little boy's life was being 
wrecked by the pressure of a mother who cared so much! 
</P>
<P>
 "And I thought at the time, 'God, if you care so much, why does it have to go 
so wrong?' And this is really behind my philosophy. I don't think parents make 
mistakes because they don't care, I think they make mistakes because they do 
care. And if you assume that they care, but just don't know what's going on, 
then you can have all the patience in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 And all the patients, too. Brazelton estimates that in 40 years of pediatric 
practice, he has cared for 25,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine the waiting list?

GALLERY: THE LAST REST STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look past the rust, the decay. 
</P>
<P>
 These shells represent life stories. Maybe a nugget of gold secured that 
Dodge, and the townsfolk were envious of the majesty it spoke with its long 
frame and formidable grille.Or how the reward for a father's long days in the 
mines of Benton, Calif., was a Sunday drive with the family in the new Model-T. 
Or the picnics attended, the fairs visited, the trips taken in the mighty 1915 
Willys Overland. And what of the secrets left in the back of the 1931 Ford? 
</P>
<P>
 But the rusting, decaying shells also tell stories. Of flight and loss; riches 
gone and towns abandoned. Change and growth as swift as a gold rush. And as 
haunting as these ghosts of the past.

 Don't know if you've heard, but Angelenos are burning up the phone lines, and 
they're not dialing 900-numbers or "Callin' ya from the car, babe." 
</P>
<P>
 The newest phone game has to do with Pacific Bell's call return feature. If 
you catch the phone on the last ring just as the other person is hanging up, 
you just press *69 and the number is automatically called back. (Other phone 
companies have similar services.) 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds innocent enough, but true phone fun aficionados are finding it can 
get a little more complicated than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Say you're one of those people who likes to play the hang-up game; that is, 
you call someone to see if he or she is home, then hang up on "Hello." 
</P>
<P>
 If the person you call happens to have call return, you can be instantly 
busted. 
</P>
<P>
 John: Dials ex-girlfriend Jane, hangs up as she says, "Hello." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: Presses *69, gets ex-boyfriend John. 
</P>
<P>
 John: "Hello?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Who is this ?" 
</P>
<P>
 John: "Who is this ?" Jane slams down phone. 
</P>
<P>
 John: Presses *69, gets ex-girlfriend Jane. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Hello?" 
</P>
<P>
 John: "Who is this ?" he demands and then recognizes her voice. "Jane? Why are 
you calling me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jane: "Why are you calling me ?" 
</P>
<P>
 And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Makes you nostalgic for rotary phones, doesn't it?

 Essentials: If you're a new parent in L.A., you're going to have to start

anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 While trolling around the mall the other day, we were suddenly struck by the 
number of parents dressed like their toddlers. No, we're not talking about 
those obnoxious matching mother-daughter outfits, but a more subtle merging of 
styles -- like the way some couples eventually start to dress alike. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, we'd see a little girl dressed in a pinafore, blouse and T-strap 
shoes while her mother would have on an oversized jumper with a T-shirt and 
Mary Janes. Or a small boy would be wearing a colorful polo shirt, baggy shorts 
and over-designed tennis shoes, and his father would be in virtually the same 
thing.

SHE MADE BEING DECEIVED A PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago, the distinguished British mystery writer and critic H.R.F 
Keating edited a book called "The 100 Best Books of Crime and Mystery." Two of 
his choices (only Agatha Christie and Georges Simeon had three chosen) were 
works by Margaret Millar: "A Beast in View" (1955) and "Beyond This Point Are 
Monsters" (1970). 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Millar, Keating wrote, "is surely one of the late 20th-Century crime 
fiction's best writers, in the sense that the actual writing in her books, the 
prose, is of superb quality." 
</P>
<P>
 So it is. Margaret Millar -- Maggie to a very wide and eclectic circle of 
friends -- died on March 26 at age 79, after long illness, leaving a legacy of 
some two dozen mysteries that are superior in their literary quality, the 
astonishing ingenuity of her plotting and the acuity of her insights to both 
the dark and light sides of humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 Never seeming to strain for an effect or an image, she wrote in "A Beast in 
View" of a nervous woman who looked like "a sparrow preserved in ice." The face 
of a woman suddenly angry seemed "like rising dough." And she wrote of an 
ill-treated servant who was "owed back wages in civility as well as cash." 
</P>
<P>
 She once made a note for a story in which a young woman comes upon a tombstone 
bearing her name, date of birth and date of death -- four years previously. 
Examining the idea again sometime later, Millar told herself, "Write yourself 
out of that one, kiddo," and she did, very adroitly indeed, in "A Stranger in 
My Grave." 
</P>
<P>
 In both of the novels Keating chose, the dark secrets of deeply disturbed 
psyches are carefully concealed until the very last stunning paragraphs. She 
had a magician's gift for misdirection, but she played fair and told no 
literary lies. Her books make being deceived a rare pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Millar's books are entertainments, but they are placed in a precisely observed 
and described world, most often Santa Barbara and Southern California 
generally. And she is no less convincing about the inner lives of migrant farm 
workers than of their well-heeled but not necessarily well-adjusted employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her villains are monstrous indeed, innocuous as they may seem at first glance, 
and they are thrown into even sharper relief because they are surrounded by (or 
at least brush against) characters who represent the human decencies at their 
best. Pure good and pure evil were not really part of her equation, although 
the evil is undoubtedly high octane. 
</P>
<P>
 Her work reveals the author. In private, Maggie Millar was funny, feisty, a 
wickedly keen observer of the world she lived in, a fighter for the environment 
and other good causes, with a well developed sense of outrage at injustices 
wherever she found them. And, not least, she wa uncommonly brave in the face of 
a siege of medical problems. Whe she lost a lung to cancer, her complaint to a 
reporter was that it affected her buoyancy; the first time she resumed her 
daily swim at the Coral Casino, she sank to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Ken Millar, who wrote as Ross Macdonald because she had already 
preempted the family name in the mystery field, once said: "Writers learn to 
drop more and more personal clues. Like burglars who secretly wish to be 
caught, we leave our fingerprints on the brokern locks...our fooprints in the 
wet concrete and the blowing sand." 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Millar can be imagined from her novels, which are full of clues to her 
intelligence, her compassion, her abiding concerns, her sly wit, her love of 
people and of language. The novels we have are a handsome and enduring legacy, 
but it is a powerful sadness to think there will be no more. Charles Champlin

POP MUSIC CHARTS: THE '12 PLAY' MAINSTAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one has been able to bump R. Kelly's "Bump 'n' Grind" out of the top spots 
of The Times' Southern California pop singles chart and the national pop 
singles chart. This long-running hit is the big selling point for his "12 Play" 
album--which is No. 12 on The Times' chart. Pink Floyd's "The Division Bell" 
album, on the heels of the group's Rose Bowl shows last weekend, continues to 
do strong business, topping The Times pop chart. As you might expect, Nirvana 
is dominating the hard-rock chart with "In Utero" (No. 1) and "Nevermind" (No. 
7). TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,43,11 Title, Artist (National Rank) Last Week 1 The

 CITY SLICKER: Today is draft day in the National Football League (C3). But it 
doesn't always turn out the way players expect. Mike Petko, a former standout 
linebacker at Servite High, was drafted high by the New England Patriots in 
1991. But he never played pro football, due to a shoulder injury at Nebraska. . 
. . He now manages a car dealership in western Nebraska and works on his 
father-in-law's ranch. The difference between making a tackle and pulling a new 
calf into the world? "There's 69,999 less people watching," Petko says. "Both 
are exhilarating though." 
</P>
<P>
 MELLOW ERIC? Now that former Rams runner Eric Dickerson's career is over, he 
seems less bitter about past disputes. . . . On a TV talk show last week, a 
caller asked about his former feud with Rams owner Georgia Frontiere. Dickerson 
explained that Rams exec John Shaw was actually in charge. And Shaw, says 
Dickerson, has changed: "Now John wants to solve problems instead of making 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 DISTINGUISHED: Carlos Fuentes is a political activist in his native Mexico, 
but in the United States, he's known mostly for his novels. His bestseller "The 
Old Gringo" was turned into a Jane Fonda movie. . . . Fuentes speaks at Chapman 
University Monday, as its "Distinguished Writer for 1994." His visit is part of 
Chapman's yearlong celebration of Latino culture. Part of its package: Students 
can see "The Old Gringo" movie free on campus tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 HOT PIPES: When Plummer Auditorium opened in Fullerton in 1930, its crown 
jewel was its Grand Wurlitzer theater organ, one of just two in the U.S. But in 
later years it was rarely used and wound up in sad disrepair. All that's 
changed now. A renovation project completed by local organ aficionado Robert 
Trousdale has it better than ever. . . . The inaugural concert for the organ -- 
Lyn Larsen at the console -- is at 2 p.m. today. Says a spokesman: "The sound 
is beautiful! It's amazing all it can do."

Drive, Irvine. Info: (714) 559-3333.

 Starr Ranch Trips -- There will be two field trips to the Starr Ranch Audubon 
Sanctuary next weekend. South Coast Audubon, a chapter of the National Audubon 
Society, will sponsor a trip there Saturday, and the Sea & Sage chapter of the 
National Audubon Society will hold a special bird-athon field trip to the 
sanctuary May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately owned sanctuary, which is nearly 4,000 acres, is home to many 
bird species crowded out by urban sprawl, according to South Coast Audubon 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast trip begins at 8 a.m. A previous South Coast Audubon trip 
yielded sightings of western tanagers and lazuli buntings. Participants are 
asked to bring binoculars and field guides (and a lunch, if they wish to eat 
with the group at the sanctuary's picnic area in the citrus grove). Heavy shoes 
are a must; those going on the trip should dress for possible changes in the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations will be accepted at the South Coast trip to help maintain the 
sanctuary and fund research done there. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will meet at the Lucky's shopping center parking lot at Plano 
Trabuco Road and Santa Margarita Parkway in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the sanctuary is limited, so those who wish to participate are asked 
to carpool as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea & Sage trip will begin at 7:30 a.m. It is a special field trip that is 
being held in conjunction with the chapter's bird-athon events. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a minimum $25 donation for those who wish to participate in the trip. 
Preregistration is required; call the chapter office at (714) 261-7963.

PROTECT LAGUNA CHAIRMAN SETS RECORD STRAIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I want to correct some misinformation printed in a letter to the editor from 
Steve Bridges (April 17), in which he attempted to link a new community 
organization, Protect Laguna, with other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Protect Laguna is not affiliated with United Laguna, Laguna Taxpayers, Village 
Laguna or any other political organization. 
</P>
<P>
 We will cooperate with and welcome participation by other groups and 
individuals who want Laguna to be free of divisiveness, blaming and partisan 
bickering, and who will insist on fiscal responsibility from city leaders, 
emphasize public safety, support healthy activity outlets for kids, have 
respect for diversity and continue the general plan policies of environmental 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Our steering committee and supporters believe that these issues are primary in 
the minds and hearts of Lagunans and can be pursued without the animosity, 
division and political opportunism that have been so prevalent over the past 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
 This city has undergone a horrendous tragedy after which most of us have acted 
generously and with compassion toward those who lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of citizens who live in our beautiful village are known for those 
qualities, and Protect Laguna only wants to keep and enhance that image and 
reality of life here. 
</P>
<P>
 Specific policy decisions, such as the reservoir, are best made in an 
atmosphere of calm and rational debate, not finger-pointing and looking 
backward.

ORANGE COUNTY; COMMENTARY ON CHILD ABUSE; PREVENTION IS KEY TO BREAKING CYCLE 
OF MISTREATING THE YOUNG; CHANGE WILL COME WHEN WE ALL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND 
SUPPORT GRASS-ROOTS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY McCARRELL, Kathy McCarrell is executive director of the Exchange Club 
Child Abuse Prevention Center of Orange County 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are not living in gentle times. Too many of our families are riddled with 
violence, poverty, and substance and child abuse. With sickening persistence, 
reports of child abuse and neglect continue to pour in. According to the 
National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse, about 3 million cases of 
child abuse were reported in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County alone, 35,721 cases of in-home abuse were reported to the 
Child Abuse Registry last year. Nine children were abused to the point of 
death. These were reported incidents of abuse. Who can estimate what goes 
unreported? 
</P>
<P>
 Abuse falls most cruelly on our youngest children, and 9% of victims of fatal 
physical abuse are under age 5. Scores more bear permanent physical and 
emotional scarring. Elizabeth Mehren, reporting (April 12) on the "Quiet 
Crisis," a recent Carnegie Corp. report regarding the status of children in 
America, notes that one in three victims of physical abuse is a baby and that 
infants are the fastest-growing category of children entering foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, experts in the study of sexual abuse believe that as many as one 
in three American females and one in six males are sexually abused in their 
childhood. Taken together these statistics give shape to a social problem of 
staggering economic proportions in terms of the nation's programs for 
education, health, welfare and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence is there. It is overwhelming. But for those raised in families 
untouched by violence, it is difficult to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is my great fear that we, as a society, have heard these numbers so 
many times that we are becoming numb to the human tragedy they represent. 
</P>
<P>
 What is going on? What is behind the numbers? Why the sudden media spotlight 
on child abuse? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the celebrity confessions of Oprah Winfrey and Roseanne Arnold have 
focused on the subject, but the problem has plagued humankind through the ages. 
In contemporary civilized societies, however, harming one's children 
physically, sexually or mentally is morally reprehensible as well as illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents who mistreat their children do not do so maliciously with an 
intent to damage them. These individuals are following definable and 
predictable patterns of child-parent interactions which they learned during 
their earliest, most impressionable periods of life. A history of abuse, 
combined with a sense of isolation, frustration, unresolved anger, low 
self-esteem and a lack of resources, often results in abusive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not mean that an adult cannot be held accountable for the acts he or 
she perpetrates. However, understanding the origin of such behavior does allow 
us to work toward reversing the trend and break the cycle of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a Child Abuse Prevention Council of Orange County report stated that 
"increasing attention must be placed on child abuse prevention so we can stop 
children from ever being victimized." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also outlined the financial impact child abuse had on the county, 
where it is estimated that $55 million in federal, state and county tax dollars 
was spent just on out-of-home placement of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Westmore, chair of the nonprofit council, stated that prevention 
programs can cost as little as $2,500 per family each year, as compared to 
out-of-home placement, which can cost up to 20 times that amount. "Prevention," 
she said, "provides invaluable short- and long-term benefits to families and 
our communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Prevention is the key to breaking the vicious cycle of abuse. But that change 
is not going to come through government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Change will come when we all take responsibility for the problem and support 
grass-roots movements committed to improving the lives of children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Exchange Club Child Abuse Prevention Center of Orange County is just such 
an organization. The center is designed to impact the generational cycle of 
abuse by recruiting, training and matching volunteers with families who are 
struggling with abusive tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1984, the unique program has goals of providing support to end the 
isolation that often accompanies parenthood, of providing resources to link the 
family with other community services and of modeling healthy, nurturing 
parenting through weekly visits. The results are remarkable. In a significant 
number of cases the chain of abuse is broken and families live together in 
greater harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, CAPC volunteer parent aides spent more than 9,000 hours working 
with at-risk families. In human terms, that means 447 children stayed out of 
foster and custodial care facilities and their parents out of the judicial 
system; the effort save taxpayers $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts of groups such as the Exchange Club Child Abuse Prevention Center 
depend on volunteers; men and women who will educate the public, raise funds, 
and who are willing to face the challenge of child abuse head-on, person to 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not enough to simply feel outrage when reading the statistics or 
compassion when reading the heart-tugging story of a child beaten to death. 
</P>
<P>
 To end the cycle of abuse, we, as individuals within our own communities, must 
be willing to get involved. The simple truth remains: All that is necessary for 
evil to succeed is for good people to do nothing.

MISGUIDED COMPASSION FOR CRIMINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was outraged to read Mr. Parsons' recent column on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 After attacking Collene Campbell, one of California's most dedicated and 
courageous heroes in the fight to return balance to our justice system, Parsons 
concludes that all we can do is hope that when violent criminals get out of 
prison "their impulse isn't to go looking for another crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The simple facts are that criminal justice research overwhelmingly shows that 
the "impulse" of released sexual predators is to continue predation, and the 
group of criminals Parsons sympathizes with most, three-time cat burglars, 
continue being burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 We know two things with certainty. No known rehabilitation program has 
produced significant positive results, and the longer violent predators are 
unable to inflict pain on society, the safer Californians will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals urge compassion for the criminals and hope, against all reason, that 
costly, new prison programs will somehow transform savage child molesters and 
rapists when they are released. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us focused on public safety urge compassion for the quarter of 
society who are already victims of violent crimes and the 1 of 2 Californians 
who will sadly join our ranks in the years ahead if current laws and resulting 
trend are not changed. 
</P>
<P>
 (San Juan Capistrano) Mayor Collene Campbell is deserving of our thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 She speaks for so many Californians who can no longer speak for themselves.

TOPPLING TREES MADE FIDUCIARY SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times is looking through rose-colored glasses when it suggests that the 
board at (Laguna Niguel's condominium association) Potomac Landing was remiss 
in "secretly" electing to remove troublesome eucalyptus trees from common and 
restricted-common areas without a community forum ("Toppling Trees, and 
Harmony," Editorial, April 15). 
</P>
<P>
 As a long-term resident of a community association and a board member, I 
assure you from experience that it is futile to expect concurrence and 
cooperation from many homeowners on any issue, no matter how 
inconsequential.Communal association living can bring out the worst in 
neighbors, and board members have a thankless task at hand for which they are 
not compensated. Clearly the board at Potomac Landing has a fiduciary 
responsibility to protect the "rights" of the hilltop owners who paid premiums 
for their views and who may therefore pay higher monthly dues assessments for 
this privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree growth is a nuisance condition which evolved over time to the 
detriment of the original charter of the association. Had the trees not been 
removed, or appropriately shortened, the association would have had the 
responsibility to compensate the hilltop owners for their loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower-elevation homeowners have no corresponding loss, since premiums were 
not paid. It was clearly a sound management decision to remove 
expensive-to-maintain and fire-hazardous eucalyptus trees, which also pose 
liability risks due to their tendency to drop heavy branches which can injure 
or kill people and damage property. 
</P>
<P>
 Threats of violence directed at the board should not be tolerated and I hope 
appropriate charges have been filed with law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the "would-be cowboy" who brandished his shotgun at tree cutters 
should have his weapons legally confiscated and be committed accordingly to 
psychiatric care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aaah, paradise!"

LAGUNA EVENT A WALK ON THE MILD SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * April 9 was one of the most rewarding Saturdays we have spent in a long, 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
 We were fortunate enough to participate in the Sawdust Festival ArtWalk for 
the first time.We understand that this is the third annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sawdust Festival ArtWalk has to be the best-kept secret in Laguna Beach. 
We visited the studios/homes of seven artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who live in Laguna and appreciate the beauty our artist friends 
and neighbors create must take personally the responsibility to maintain the 
quality of the life we all enjoy and our artists thrive on. 
</P>
<P>
 This delightful event is what Laguna is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much anguish, pain and negativism in our world. It was a welcome 
change to be able to truly and deeply enjoy what is meaningful about our 
special community.

CONSERVATIVES RUINING A GOOD PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Newsletter Authors Get a Taste of Their Own Caustic Ink" (March 30) just 
gives a small sampling of the petty divisiveness that goes on in the inner 
circles of the Orange County Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 It prompts me to comment on how embarrassing it is to belong to a party -- 
with such proud forefathers as Abraham Lincoln, a party grounded in high-minded 
ideas of less government and more individual freedom -- that seems proud of 
members that stoop to such pettiness. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the work of small minds who need to engage in such foolish combat when 
attention needs to be focused on how to keep this party from blowing into even 
smaller pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 And where does that leave those of more moderate persuasion? 
</P>
<P>
 Reading Times articles about how Tom Fuentes and crew try to talk candidates, 
most especially those who will not toe their ultraconservative party line, out 
of running for "the sake of party unity." There's no unity in the Big Tent and 
there is a sign over the door that says "Don't come in here if you don't think 
like us!" 
</P>
<P>
 Moderate Republicans have no political home in Orange County and few to vote 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 So while you conservatives waste time on your little gossip newsletters about 
each other and boycotting Boy Scout luncheons because you don't like Roger 
Johnson anymore, there's a health care plan in the offing that could negatively 
change the game for all of us and a governor's race that could end up like the 
last presidential race -- with someone elected who can't wait for the 
government to fund all those abortions you hate so much. 
</P>
<P>
 So can we get on with it, please?

ANGELS SUFFER THROUGH A CATCHERS-22; BASEBALL: STARTER MYERS, RESERVE BILLMEYER 
ARE INJURED AS THE RED SOX SCORE A 5-3 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Dopson always ridiculed those who talked about the ghosts of Fenway, 
wondering how any adult can actually believe this place is haunted. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent five years pitching for the Boston Red Sox, and never once did he 
sense any evil spirits tormenting the opposition. He figured it was nothing 
more than an excuse for losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dopson, pitching for the first time in his career as an opponent at Fenway, 
vowed to prove to his Angel teammates Saturday that this place is like any 
other. There is no curse, no hex and no spell cast upon those who dare play the 
Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, guess who quickly became a believer, and is convinced the demons are for 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels watched in horror as they lost, 5-3, and witnessed the cruel 
happenings to their starting catcher, a bullpen catcher and a reliever, all of 
whom are heading on different flights out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, what a day," Dopson said. "It started off weird and got a whole lot 
worse. I guess what they say about this place is right." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Myers, the Angels' starting catcher, was put on the 15-day disabled list 
after suffering a possible strained medial collateral ligament in his left 
knee. He will be examined today to determine if surgery is necessary and will 
be replaced on the roster by Jorge Fabregas, who is batting .118 at triple-A 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers' injury occurred in the fifth inning in a home-plate collision with Red 
Sox left fielder Mike Greenwell. Mo Vaughn hit a fly ball to center fielder 
Chad Curtis and Greenwell tagged from third, Curtis' throw arriving at the 
plate as Greenwell did. Greenwell lowered his left shoulder, and his elbow 
caught Myers flush in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers was knocked backward, the ball came flying out of his glove and he lay 
motionless on the ground. He was helped off the field, and X-rays at Children's 
Hospital showed that no bones were broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my neck snapping back and ringing in my head," Myers said, "but 
when I came to, that's when I felt my knee. It wasn't moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Mick Billmeyer, the Angel bullpen catcher, didn't even make it to the first 
pitch. He was warming up Dopson in the bullpen before the game and was 
expecting Dopson to throw a slider. Instead, a fastball shattered a bone in his 
left arm. He will be sidelined four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only good thing about it," said Billmeyer, pointing to his cast, "is that 
Bo (Jackson) signed it and wished me a happy birthday. I think I'll cut off his 
part, sell it for $10,000, and pay for my car." 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Mike Butcher, who had a 16.62 earned-run average, was optioned to 
Vancouver. He will be replaced by Ken Patterson, who has a 9.53 ERA at 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get mad when things are going this bad," Butcher said. "I don't 
think it's anything physical or mechanical, but mental. It was like a 
roller-coaster inside my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Dopson, who gave up 10 hits and five earned runs in four innings, is 1-2 with 
a 6.00 ERA and becomes the leading candidate to depart when Joe Magrane returns 
in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough day for me," Dopson said, "but a real bad day for catchers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have now gone 612 days since winning at Fenway Park. They have not 
won here since Aug. 20, 1992, when Bert Blyleven was the winning pitcher. They 
have lost a franchise-record eight consecutive games at Fenway, and have not 
won a series in Boston since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way things are going here," Billmeyer said, "we'd fall off the Hindenburg 
and land on the Titanic." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Chris Turner will inherit the bulk of the catching duties. He is 
batting .111, and is hitless in his last 18 at-bats. The Mild, Mild West 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels lost their second game in a row to fall two games below .500 but 
still lead the new AL West. A look at the standings: 04,09,04,04,04 Team W L GB

MORNING BRIEFING: PROMOTIONAL GIFT COMES WITH RAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Snoop Doggy Dogg sparked a run on Springfield, Mass., Indian jerseys after he 
was shown wearing the sweater of the American Hockey League team in his video 
for the song, "Gin and Juice." 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials aren't sure when or where the hot-selling rapper bought the 
jersey, or if he is a hockey fan. In the video, he is also shown wearing a 
Pittsburgh Penguin sweater. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know it was going to be in the video," said Carol Appleton, 
director of group sales for the Indians. "We saw it one night and the next day 
the phone was ringing off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 They can expect more calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Pearl Jam also liked the logo and, after a recent concert stop, 
left Springfield with several Indian T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Whose record did Babe Ruth break when he hit 60 home runs in 
1927? 
</P>
<P>
 Clause of no concern: Peter Gammons in the Boston Globe: "The winner of the 
Idiotic Clause Award goes to (Milwaukee) Brewer DH Brian Harper, who gets 
$50,000 for (winning) a Gold Glove. For Brewer General Manager Sal Bando, 
giving in to that clause must have been like agreeing to not eat seal blubber 
for Lent." 
</P>
<P>
 Splendid retort: Walt Hriniak, batting coach of the Chicago White Sox, said of 
criticism that Frank Thomas takes too many walks for a power hitter: "They used 
to say the same thing about Ted Williams." 
</P>
<P>
 Attention, Jerry West: Reported the Sporting News: "Rick Pitino is at it 
again. Every year, he tells us how happy he is at Kentucky. And every year his 
name surfaces in NBA coaching rumors. Last year, it was the Clippers. This 
year, it's the Lakers, Celtics and Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This, even though he promised his son that they would stay put in Lexington 
until his son's high school graduation in 1996, he gets a $1-million bonus if 
he is still at Kentucky in 2000, he signed blue-chipper Antoine Walker and he 
has most of his team returning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pitino sure likes being courted, doesn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
 No-brainer: Said Ray Miller, pitching coach of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who 
advises his pitchers to not waste time: "When a pitcher works fast, he has less 
time to think, which is a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Say what?Said Jim Courier, asked by a reporter in Nice why he is so popular in 
France: "Parce que je parle comme une vache espagnole."  
</P>
<P>
 Translation: "Because I speak French like a Spanish cow." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: His own. Ruth hit 59 home runs in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: John Daly, after playing all four rounds at the Masters with Ian 
Woosnam: "Woosy and I are talking about marriage. He says it's the longest 
relationship he's ever had." JERRY CROWE

UCLA MOVES AHEAD IN ANOTHER VOLLEYBALL TITLE QUEST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Nygaard made 25 kills and Tim Kelly had 12 without making a hitting error 
as UCLA stayed on track to defend its NCAA championship in men's volleyball 
with a 15-5, 15-4, 15-7 sweep over second-ranked Stanford in the Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation championship match Saturday night in Maples Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Bruins, who earned an automatic berth in the NCAA Final Four on 
May 6-7 in Ft.Wayne, Ind., have won 26 consecutive matches since losing their 
opener to Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (18-9) drops into the MPSF tournament semifinals against Pepperdine 
at 8 p.m. Monday. The tournament winner probably also will receive an 
invitation to the NCAA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine (14-8) advanced by upsetting sixth-ranked Cal State Northridge, 
15-8, 15-8, 16-14. Brigham Young (20-5) and USC (17-6) will meet in Monday's 
other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-ranked Brigham Young downed Hawaii, 12-15, 15-10, 15-7, 15-5, in 
first-round action. Fourth-ranked USC swept San Diego State, 15-2, 15-6, 15- 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Jason Mulholland and Chris Underwood, the Trojans hit at a .466 clip 
against the Aztecs. Mulholland had a match-high 20 kills and seven digs. 
Underwood had 19 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the match for the federation's regular-season championship, UCLA trailed 
only once, 5-1, in the third game. The Bruins have won an NCAA-record 14 
national championships. MIKE HISERMAN

LOPEZ DEFEATS SEQUENAN BY TKO AFTER BOXERS BUTT HEADS EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was another Olympic Auditorium barroom brawl Saturday night, full of sneaky 
elbow shots, head butts and low blows. 
</P>
<P>
 After two of the undercard fights were stopped because of deep cuts, Hector 
Lopez won the main event against Rod Sequenan by technical knockout after the 
fifth round before about 800. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez (26-3-1, 13 knockouts) got the victory when referee Chuck Hassett 
stopped the fight because of a heavy gash over Sequenan's right forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequenan (56-23) received the cut when the two junior-welterweights butted 
heads early in the second round, and blood poured down the right side of his 
face for the rest of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw him get cut, it was the instinct of a fighter to go after him, 
finish him off," Lopez said. "But then I got cut, too, so I kind of regret it." 
</P>
<P>
 After Lopez stepped up his attack, the left-handed Sequenan fought off several 
hard hooks and landed some heavy blows as the two fighters swung wildly from 
close range. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the round, Lopez said he had been cut, and his own face was 
bloody. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez dominated the next three rounds by staying outside and targeting the 
slower Sequenan with precision shots to the head and, eventually, to the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unfortunate that it was stopped the way it was, but I was going to 
stop him, anyway," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-round fight, junior-welterweight Pepe Reilley (6-1) was cut but won 
a unanimous decision over Randy Archuleta (6-9).

GYMNASTICS / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; O'NEILL WINS RARE MEDAL FOR AMERICAN MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill, 28, of Mandan, N.D., became first American man to win a medal at 
the World Gymnastics Championships in 15 years when he won a silver medal in 
the rings event Saturday at Brisbane, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The last American men to win medals at the World Championships were Bart 
Connor in the parallel bars and Kurt Thomas in the floor exercise in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuri Chechi of Italy won the rings for the third consecutive year, with 9.787 
points. O'Neill had 9.725 points. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, who only competes in the rings, probably will not be able to compete 
in the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a rings specialist, but unless they change the rules to include more than 
all-around competitors, I won't be able to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While O'Neill was producing a surprising result for the American men's team, 
women's star Shannon Miller, winner of the all-around title Friday, met with 
misfortune in the vault Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the last of eight competitors in the vault, scored 9.825 points on her 
first attempt to lead the competition. But she fell on her dismount on her 
second vault and finished seventh overall with a score 9.543, far back of 
Romanian gold medalist Gina Gogean's total of 9.812. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 17, of Edmond, Okla., had won the all-around competition thanks to an 
outstanding performance on the vault. She needed to score 9.775 on her two 
vaults, and scored 9.812. 
</P>
<P>
 In other events, Vitaly Scherbo, showing flashes of his old form, won the 
men's floor exercises, and Luo Li, a tiny 17-year-old from China, received 
9.912 points -- the highest score of the championships so far -- to win the 
women's uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherbo, 22, of Belarus won his first title of the championships after having 
finished a disappointing third in defense of his all-around title earlier in 
the week and struggling during qualifying events. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherbo won six gold medals at the 1992 Olympic Games and three at last year's 
World Championships.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; ROY LEAVES HOSPITAL AND LEADS CANADIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Roy has beaten his illness, and the Montreal Canadiens are feeling a 
lot fitter in their bid to retain the NHL title. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy, Montreal's goaltender, got out of a hospital bed Saturday morning and 
about 12 hours later stopped 39 shots as the Canadiens defeated the Boston 
Bruins, 5-2, at Montreal to even their first-round playoff series at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy was hospitalized for two days because of appendicitis, and there were 
fears he would require surgery, which would have finished him for this series. 
But the condition responded to antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 He skated onto the Montreal Forum ice to a standing ovation and stopped the 
first 12 shots he faced. He was at his best in power-play situations, stopping 
Boston cold on six opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, I felt like I didn't even go the hospital," Roy said. "Coach 
(Jacques) Demers gave me some days off during the season, and it paid off 
today. When I came back to play, even though I hadn't skated for two or three 
days, it felt like I had never stopped playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Muller scored twice and Paul DiPietro got another on power plays for 
Montreal as the Canadiens scored on three of their first five shots against 
Boston goalie Vincent Riendeau. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Carbonneau's second-period goal gave Montreal a 4-2 lead after Boston had 
cut the margin to one on goals by Adam Oates and Ted Donato. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Toronto 4 -- Tony Amonte scored four goals at Chicago, tying a 
Blackhawk playoff record set by Denis Savard against Toronto in 1986 and 
cutting the Maple Leafs' lead to 2-1 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Amonte scored twice in the first 2:07, doubling Chicago's output from the 
first two games combined, and had one each in the second and third periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Amonte skated down the right side and beat Felix Potvin one on one at 1:31 of 
the final period to make the score 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Goalie Don Beaupre stopped all but one of the 22 
shots he faced, and Joe Juneau and Dimitri Khristich each had a goal and an 
assist to help the Capitals to a commanding 3-1 series lead at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the teams met in the playoffs, the Penguins rallied from a 3-1 
deficit and went on to win the Stanley Cup in 1992. Peter Bondra scored the 
go-ahead goal in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Lemieux took only two shots in the first 40 minutes and the Penguins 
managed only seven shots in the final period. Pittsburgh's lone goal came on a 
55-foot slap shot by Martin Straka in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 5, New Jersey 3 -- Wayne Presley and Yuri Khmylev each scored twice at 
Buffalo as this series finally showed some offense and evened up at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams had managed only a combined eight goals in the first three games, 
with neither team managing more than two in any game. 
</P>
<P>
 John MacLean had a goal and two assists for the Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 4, Detroit 3 -- Sergei Makarov scored the game-winner 6:35 into the 
third period at San Jose as the Sharks evened their series with the Red Wings 
at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit led 2-0 after the first period and 3-1 after Kris Draper's goal at 
6:08 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sharks got a goal from Igor Larionov less than two minutes later and 
tied the score when Ulf Dahlen scored a power-play goal at 11:55 of the second 
period.

COMMENTARY; SOMETIMES, THE ART OF SLIDING CAN'T BE LEARNED FROM A BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We could talk about Jimmy Johnson and Magic Johnson, the men leaving and 
coming back, coming back and leaving. Or we could talk about Steve Carlton 
proving it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your 
mouth and remove all doubt. There's the senator from Maine who'd rather wear a 
baseball cap than a judge's robe. We could talk about Cecil Fielder being too 
big to do what he does and Muggsy Bogues being too little. 
</P>
<P>
 Or we could thank Betty Ford for Pat Summerall and Mickey Mantle, the old 
heroes alive and, at last, glad of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball is juiced, some folks say, and it's flying out of the ballpark in 
record numbers. We could talk about that: We could say that'll end when the 
umpires make the strike zone bigger than a mail slot. So much to say. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will have to wait. We're talking sliding this week. We have 
strawberries and noodles, broken cigars and mustardy hot dogs. We have Rick 
Dempsey as Babe Ruth. We'll tell you how to build a sliding pit. And we have 
Michael Jordan doing the limbo, sort of, at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 We begin with Pete Rose, forever famous in sliding annals for having explained 
his face this way: "If you'd slid head first for 20 years, you'd look like 
this, too." We begin with a Rose strawberry, this in a spring long ago. Anyone 
who ever threw himself down on a gravelly infield knows about strawberries. 
They're red, ripe and tender. As Rose cleaned grit from the strawberry atop his 
thigh, a man made this diagnosis: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ouchee-wawa." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's from noodles," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Noodles?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Did it making a commercial for a Japanese noodle company," Rose said. "Musta 
slid for an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking sliding, a fundamental act of baseball instinct, an act given 
full demonstration any time the 1980s Orioles had a long rain delay. Then 
catcher Rick Dempsey stuffed his uniform with towels until he took on a Ruthian 
silhouette, after which he circled the bases and flung himself head first on 
the tarpaulin, sliding through the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Hawkins, the old football flake, once said he knew what baseball's 
trouble was: 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, you don't ever see a fella sliding into second base and breaking 
his cigar." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad he missed Gates Brown and the hot dogs. On August 7, 1968, Brown 
wasn't in the Detroit lineup and so, always a hungry player, he sneaked from 
the dugout to the clubhouse and came back with two hot dogs slathered with 
mustard -- only to be ordered by Manager Mayo Smith to pinch hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's solution to his problem -- he couldn't let the skipper see his snack 
-- was to stuff the hot dogs in his jersey. As he would tell it: "I always 
wanted to get a hit every time I went to the plate. But this was one time I 
didn't want to get a hit. I'll be damned if I didn't smack one in the gap and I 
had to slide into second -- head first, no less. I was safe with a double. But 
when I stood up, I had mustard and ketchup and smashed hot dogs and buns all 
over me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fielders took one look at me, turned their backs and damned near busted a 
gut laughing at me. My teammates in the dugout went crazy." After fining Brown 
$100, Smith said, "What the hell were you doing eating on the bench in the 
first place?" Brown: "I decided to tell him the truth. I said, 'I was hungry. 
Besides, where else can you eat a hot dog and have the best seat in the house?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone talking about sliding needs to track down the textbook by Al Campanis 
in 1954, when he was a smart guy. A generation later Campanis became a dumb guy 
by trying to explain to Ted Koppel that some people didn't have the, the, the, 
the necessities to manage a baseball team. It was in his smart days as the 
Brooklyn Dodgers' director of player personnel -- he found Roberto Clemente and 
Sandy Koufax -- that Campanis wrote "The Dodgers' Way to Play Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Using 10 pages of text and illustrations, Campanis told readers everything 
about sliding. "Sliding is rapidly becoming a lost art," he wrote. So he 
spelled out the fundamentals and explained drills necessary to reinforce a 
player's instincts. Campanis even included instructions for the building of a 
sliding pit: 
</P>
<P>
 "A 16-foot square is excavated to a depth of three or four feet. This is 
filled with fine sand and some sawdust is sprinkled on top. A strap is anchored 
in the exact center of the pit, coming up through the sand. The base is 
attached to the strap so that there is some play to it. . . . A rake should be 
on hand during sliding practice as the sand and sawdust need smoothing out 
after a few slides have been made." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Michael Jordan's next investment in Birmingham should be material for 
the construction of a sliding pit. Here's why. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan reached base last week on an infield scratch, his specialty. From 
third, on a wild pitch, he headed for home. In this Information Age, we could 
see this drama unfold on ESPN. We could see the catcher's throw to the pitcher 
covering. We could see Jordan coming into the picture from the left side. We 
waited to see him slide into home. What a fabulous moment this would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Er, no. Not exactly. Jordan needed to slide. He wanted to slide. He tried to 
slide. He just couldn't slide. So he sort of stopped. And leaned backward, away 
from the tag, leaning backward until he lost his balance and touched the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 And while he did all this, he let his feet go forward. They made little baby 
steps of an embarrassed nature. His embarrassed feet tippy-toed toward the 
plate while the rest of his body leaned backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Michael is called out," ESPN's Keith Olbermann said, " . . . for 
TRAVELING."

BETHEL MAKES WAY BACK INTO COMPETITION; TRACK: AFTER A TWO-MONTH LAYOFF BECAUSE 
OF A FREAK INJURY TO HER EYE, THE TEEN-AGE STAR IS IN ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE LACQUES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two months after losing her right eye in a freak accident while jogging, 
14-year-old track standout Ashley Bethel of Lake Forest returned Saturday to 
what she enjoys most: competing and winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Though her times and marks were not her best, Bethel still won the 200-meter 
hurdles and the high jump at a USA Track and Field-sanctioned meet at Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-grader from Los Alisos Intermediate School also finished second in 
the long jump, but fell well short of her personal best of 19 feet 7 1/4 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel, who lost her eye Feb. 23 when she was struck by a golf ball shot from 
an adjacent driving range while jogging at Saddleback College, showed little 
sign of being affected by her injury, but was plagued by rustiness. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first event, the 200 hurdles, she got off to a slow start but used a 
late surge to win. Bethel's time of 28.47 was about a second and a half slower 
than her personal best of 27.00. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a relief to see her go over the hurdles," said Skip Bethel, her father 
and coach. "Her legs are really not there yet. (But) if she went out and 
finished last, I would have been just as proud as her, given the conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel, competing for the El Toro-based Silver Wings Track Club, admitted she 
was a bit anxious returning to competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous going over all of (the hurdles)," she said. "I was high on some 
of the hurdles, but the (speed) burst was still there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bethel has been training for less than three weeks, and that was evident in 
her long jump performance, Skip Bethel said. She leaped 15-7 1/4, four feet 
less than her best, which he chalked up to inactivity, not her injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like she was hitting the board OK, but she just didn't have the 
speed," he said. "She's not in shape for a long all-day meet like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, she won the high jump with a leap of 5-4, an inch off her personal 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 An interested observer at Saturday's meet was Billy Ivey, who lost his left 
eye when he was 13, yet went on to set a Southern Section 2-A record in the 
triple jump at West Covina Edgewood High. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivey, who will play football for Montana next year, has grown close to Bethel 
since learning of her plight. Ivey says Bethel shouldn't have any problems 
proceeding with her career. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The injury) won't have any effects at all," he said. "Mentally, that's the 
only way it could stop her, but as you can see, she hasn't missed a beat." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Bethel was glad to be participating again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good to be back," she said. "I missed competing against my friends."

NEWPORT HARBOR'S ABRAMS FALLS SHORT BY A SHOT; TENNIS: SOPHOMORE BLOWS TWO 
BREAK-POINT OPPORTUNITIES AND LOSES, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, TO SANTA BARBARA'S JACKMON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The boys' interscholastic singles final between Newport Harbor sophomore Geoff 
Abrams and Santa Barbara senior Nathan Jackmon was played Saturday afternoon on 
a back court at Libbey Park. But given the intensity and the level of play, it 
would have been more appropriate to stage the match this afternoon on the 
park's center court, the site and time of the Pac-10 men's final. 
</P>
<P>
 One spectacular shot after another brought loud cheers from the overflow 
crowd. Ultimately, Jackmon had one more spectacular shot than Abrams as he won, 
6-4, 3-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't afford to miss any shots," Jackmon said. "I just missed a few 
less than he did." 
</P>
<P>
 One shot that appeared as though Jackmon would miss turned into the shot of 
the match, and turned momentum in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 With the third-set score tied at four games, Abrams appeared ready to bring 
the game score to deuce when he caught a lucky break and ticked the top of the 
net with a passing shot. Off balance and falling down, Jackmon angled a 
cross-court backhand drop shot that fell delicately over the net and inside the 
line. Abrams, standing near the baseline, could only shake his head in 
amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to be able to do that all the time," Abrams said. "That's a 
one-out-of-five or one-out-of-seven shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackmon even seemed to amaze himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled that out of somewhere," he said, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
 That point brought the partisan crowd to its feet and it appeared to carry 
Jackmon through the final game. He broke Abrams' service by hitting several 
bullet returns past a charging Abrams. The match ended uneventfully, as Abrams 
hit an easy backhand volley into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Abrams appeared pleased with his performance but a little upset 
with Jackmon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said a few snide remarks that got me (angry) in the first set, but that 
got me going a little after I lost the first set," Abrams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams had a big chance to win the first set, but blew two break-point 
opportunities with a 4-3 lead. Said Jackmon: "That totally changed the match." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it was simply a case of who could reach the net first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he'd come to the net, so I was going to try to come in before him," 
Jackmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Jackmon beat Sunny Hills sophomore Kevin Kim to the net 
with a bit more ease. He pounced on Kim early and never let up, winning, 6-2, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's ranked No. 1 in the country in the 16s and I knew he'd come in with a 
lot of confidence," Jackmon said. "I didn't want to let him get started." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that he was facing two sophomores who were more highly 
publicized and had higher rankings, Jackmon said he had nothing to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning or losing has nothing to do with it," said Jackmon, who has yet to 
choose a college. "As long as you improve yourself, that's what matters. Two 
years from now, it won't matter whether you won this or not, as long as you 
compete well." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills sophomore Joseph Gilbert performed well in the boys' 16 division 
and fared better than his teammate, Kim. He defeated Dylan Mann of Woodland 
Hills Taft, 7-5, 6-2, despite playing with a sore back. 
</P>
<P>
 "My back started hurting me in the second set," Gilbert said. "My tosses were 
low." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilbert, who lost to Abrams in last year's Ojai boys' 16 final, made up 
for his inconsistent serves by breaking Mann's service five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a groove on his serve," Gilbert said. "It's a big, flat serve and I 
started grooving on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach's Taylor Dent, son of former Australian Open champion Phil Dent, 
won a tight match in the boys' 14 final over Jess Melton of Los Angeles, 6-7 
(7-9), 6-2, 6-3. Dent blew three set points in the first-set tiebreaker, but 
rallied back on the strength of his baseline play. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' 16 doubles finals, Megan Wachtler and Gina Pelazini from Newport 
Beach defeated Emily Barker and Alissa Scott from Newport Beach, 7-6, 6-3. In 
the girls' 18 doubles final, El Modena's Brandi Freudenberg and Palos Verdes 
Peninsula's Amanda Augustus were beaten by Peninsula's Nicole London and Amber 
Basica, 7-5, 6-1.

NBA ROUNDUP; HAWKS CLINCH TOP SEEDING IN THE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NBA playoff picture got clearer Saturday, making nine of today's 11 games 
meaningless as far as the postseason is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks clinched the home-court advantage through the Eastern 
Conference playoffs with a 93-89 victory over the Orlando Magic at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks will play Miami in the best-of-five first-round series. The Magic 
will play Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta's victory locked the New York Knicks into the second seeding and the 
Chicago Bulls into the third, no matter what happens in today's game between 
the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Western Conference seedings were determined after Friday night's 
games. Top-seeded Seattle will play Denver, Houston will play Portland, Phoenix 
will play Golden State and San Antonio will play Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Playoff schedules will be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always want to be going into the playoffs on a positive note," Atlanta 
Coach Lenny Wilkens said after Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks' Stacey Augmon had 22 points and 11 rebounds, and his dunk with 26 
seconds left ended the scoring. Kevin Willis added 21 points and 14 rebounds, 
Danny Manning had 19 points and Mookie Blaylock added 15 points and 15 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks won their fourth division title since moving to Atlanta in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 The key play came with about 30 seconds remaining. Orlando trailed, 91-89, and 
had a chance to tie. But with the shot clock running down, rookie Anfernee 
Hardaway lost the ball to Blaylock, who passed to a wide-open Augmon for the 
dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was great that the game came down to a defensive play for us," 
said Wilkens, who has been stressing defense ever since he took the Hawks' job 
after stepping down as coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers after last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal, in a battle with San Antonio's David Robinson for the league 
scoring title, led the Magic with 27 points and 19 rebounds. He is averaging 
29.313 points with one game remaining against New Jersey. Robinson is averaging 
29.266 points heading into his regular-season finale tonight against the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't thinking about points," O'Neal said. "I wanted to play my game -- 
25-28 points. If I get the scoring title, I get it. If not, I'm not worrying 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Atlanta's seventh home victory in a row and its sixth in eight games 
overall to finish the season, leaving it with a franchise record-tying 57 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 135, Milwaukee 100 -- The Nets scored a season high in this game at 
East Rutherford, N.J., as their playoff picture remained unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets' fifth consecutive victory, matching their season-high, means New 
Jersey (45-36) won't know its playoff pairing until the regular season ends 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey will play either New York or Chicago in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cleveland (46-35) wins at home against Boston or both the Cavaliers and 
Nets lose today, New Jersey gets the cross-river rival Knicks, a team it beat 
four of five times in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cleveland loses and the Nets win at Orlando, New Jersey will play Chicago, 
which beat the Nets three of four times this season and 19 consecutive times at 
Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit Benjamin led eight New Jersey players in double figures with 20 points. 
Derrick Coleman had 17 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 114, Miami 81 -- Reggie Miller scored 24 points at Indianapolis as the 
Pacers clinched the fifth seeding in the Eastern Conference with a club-record 
eighth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers (47-35) finished the regular season with their best record since 
joining the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat's 42-40 was also a franchise best. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss for Miami was its 11th in a row at Market Square Arena. The Heat is 
the only NBA team never to win a game there. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 108, Detroit 103 -- Alonzo Mourning scored a career-high 39 points 
to lead the Hornets to a come-from-behind victory in their last home game of 
the season. Mourning also had 12 rebounds and five blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte, which outscored the Pistons, 37-16, in the fourth quarter, improved 
to 41-40. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 101, Sacramento 100 -- The Suns led, 94-75, with 5:45 to play at 
Phoenix before the Kings' Spud Webb led a rally that barely fell short. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb scored 13 of his season-high 32 points during the rally, capping it with 
a three-pointer with 1.3 seconds left.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; PIRATES EXTEND ATLANTA'S STREAK TO 4 
</P>

<P>
 The Atlanta Braves lost their fourth consecutive game when Kevin Young singled 
home the tiebreaking run in the ninth inning and sent the Pittsburgh Pirates to 
a 6-1 victory Saturday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's probably not a manager in the league who wouldn't mind changing 
places with (Brave Manager) Bobby Cox," Pittsburgh Manager Jim Leyland said. "I 
think they're in pretty good shape. This is the best team in the National 
League. But as good as they are, they're human, and they're going to lose a 
couple." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta, 10-0 on the road, fell to 3-5 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves, who began the season with a 13-1 record, had not lost four in a 
row since last April 25-29, when they lost five consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's gotten to the point where we -- I don't mean the players -- but 
the media, are over-analyzing each loss, breaking them down," said Atlanta 
shortstop Jeff Blauser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simple. They won and we lost. They took advantage of opportunities and 
we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, batting .095 (two for 21) entering the game, had two hits. His single 
in the ninth followed singles by pinch-hitter Dave Clark and Don Slaught 
against Greg McMichael. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando Merced and Carlos Garcia followed with run-scoring singles. Andy Van 
Slyke also singled home a run, and another run scored on left fielder Mike 
Kelly's error. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a confidence-booster," said Young, who raised his average to 
.160. "Obviously, I've been having problems, but this type of game is a 
pick-me-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 8, Chicago 2 -- Greg Harris, bidding for the first complete-game 
shutout in team history, blanked the Cubs until Mark Grace led off the ninth 
with a single and Derrick May followed with a home run at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris (1-1) struck out eight and walked three in Colorado's first complete 
game of the season. He won for only the second time in 11 decisions since San 
Diego traded him to the Rockies in the middle of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Weiss had three hits, including a solo homer, for the Rockies. Eric Young 
hit an inside-the-park homer in the eighth inning and Dante Bichette followed 
with his seventh homer. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 10, New York 1 -- Matt Williams, Royce Clayton and Mike Benjamin 
each hit two-run homers at Candlestick Park as the Giants broke out of a 
hitting slump. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, who were batting .198 in their last five games, had 14 hits 
against three New York pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Lewis led off the first with his first homer of the season, and the 
Giants made it 2-0 in the second on Lewis' run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 After Willie McGee led off the third with a single, Williams hit his seventh 
home run of the season. Benjamin hit an inside-the-park homer in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 8, Philadelphia 2 -- Tony Gwynn had five hits in five at-bats with a 
home run and tied a club record by scoring four runs at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn, who has had five or more hits in a game eight times, also drove in 
three runs as the Padres won their second straight game for the first time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 15, St. Louis 5 -- Rookie James Mouton hit a grand slam, his first 
major league homer, to highlight a six-run eighth inning at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Bass had five hits, including a homer, and drove in three runs and Steve 
Finley had four hits and also drove in three runs for the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Stankiewicz scored three times for the Astros, who had a season-high 18 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 3, Cincinnati 2 -- Pinch-runner Chuck Carr beat shortstop Barry 
Larkin's throw home on a grounder in the ninth inning to give the Marlins the 
victory at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Orestes Destrade led off with a single and was replaced by Carr, who led the 
league with 58 stolen bases last season. Carr took second on a passed ball and 
went to third on a sacrifice by Benito Santiago. Rick Renteria followed with a 
grounder to Larkin, but Carr scored ahead of the throw.

TEAM-BY-TEAM CAPSULES FOR TODAY'S NFL DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Team-by-team capsules for Sunday's NFL draft, in order of selection: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Cincinnati (3-13) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: For once, they got three promising players -- DE John Copeland, 
No. 1; TE Tony McGee, No. 2; and LB Steve Tovar, No. 3. Their eighth rounder, 
Doug Pelfrey, became their kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Offensive line, receivers, defensive backs. The signings of G Eric 
Moore and G Darrick Brilz and enigmatic DB Louis Oliver aren't necessarily the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Not good. Mike Brown isn't inclined to spend money, which 
means he'll lag behind with free agents. David Klingler may be the quarterback 
of the future, but with no protection and few receivers, he has little 
opportunity to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: DT Dan Wilkinson, Ohio State, who provides local appeal and 
a push up front, perhaps QB Heath Shuler, Tennessee, if they decide Klingler is 
expendable. 2./7. Indianapolis (4-12) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Pretty good, with three instant starters -- WR Sean Dawkins, RB 
Roosevelt Potts, and DB Ray Buchanan. Potts led the team in rushing and 
Buchanan led in interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Defensive line, particularly if Steve Emtman's knees are still 
problems. Re-signing DE Jon Hand helped, but LB Duane Bickett was released to 
get under the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: The Colts have cap trouble, but hiring Bill Tobin as the 
personnel man is a step in the right direction. So, probably, is disposing of 
QB Jeff George. Jim Harbaugh can hold the fort at quarterback until a younger 
replacement is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICKS: Probably Shuler with the second overall pick -- he's ahead 
of Trent Dilfer -- or they could go for RB Marshall Faulk, San Diego State. 
Would take Wilkinson if he's there. The second choice will have to go for 
defense, perhaps CB Antonio Langham, Alabama; DE Sam Adams, Texas A&M; DT 
Bryant Young, Notre Dame; LB John Thierry, Alcorn State; or LB Trev Alberts, 
Nebraska. 3. Washington (4-12) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: CB Tom Carter, No. 1, and RB Reggie Brooks, No. 2, were both 
outstanding as rookies, a lot better than the '92 pick, WR Desmond Howard, who 
has yet to show his potential. No. 6 FB Frank Wycheck was a pleasant surprise, 
but might not fit in new coach Norv Turner's offense. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Offensive line, a long-term quarterback, younger legs at every position 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: The years of winning with old guys and short-term 
fill-ins have ended with the arrival of Turner, who wants a youth movement. 
Turner already has cut some tired defensive players to make room for LB Ken 
Harvey and QB Mark Rypien went to make room for one of the young quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: QB Trent Dilfer, Fresno State, unless Shuler is overlooked 
by the Colts or Bengals. 4. New England (5-11) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: The first two picks did well: QB Drew Bledsoe is a future star and 
LB Chris Slade was a good pass rusher. They are the first two building blocks 
for Bill Parcells, if he can keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Wide receivers, defensive line. Linebackers to go with Slade and 
Vincent Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: A lot will have to do with how much leeway new owner 
Robert Kraft gives Parcells. Four straight wins to end the season were nice, 
but may be illusory, and Parcells may have overpaid for free-agents Bob Kratch 
and Myron Guyton in his effort to wound his old employers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Faulk may be the next RB Emmitt Smith and would allow the 
Pats to dump Leonard Russell and his salary. Newly signed Blair Thomas is a 
backup. Alberts or Thierry are possible if they trade down. 5. Rams (5-11) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Jerome Bettis, the No. 1 pick, turned out to be just what Chuck 
Knox wanted, finishing second in the league with 1,429 rushing yards and making 
the Pro Bowl. TE Troy Drayton, the second pick, looked like a promising pass 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Quarterback, offensive line, wide receivers, defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: They have to hope that free-agent QB Chris Miller stays 
healthy for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: CB Aaron Glenn, Texas A&M, or Langham. OL Aaron Taylor, 
Notre Dame, or WR Johnnie Morton, Southern Cal, are possibilities in a downward 
deal. Also OT Bernard Williams, Georgia. 6. Tampa Bay (5-11) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Decent, for once. DE Eric Curry was a productive first pick until 
getting hurt, and WR Horace Copeland, the fourth choice, was a legitimate deep 
threat, averaging 21.1 yards a catch. No. 6 DE Chidi Ahanotu was a starter, and 
the second pick, LB Demetrious DuBose, could be productive. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Offensive line, safety, running back and defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: About the best hope the Bucs have is the law of averages. 
Any team that's lost in double digits for 11 straight seasons has to get better 
sometime. Maybe a 12th straight season of that is the answer; it could bring in 
Jimmy Johnson as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Faulk if he's there (unlikely). Glenn, Taylor, Langham, 
Williams or Alberts. 8. Seattle (6-10) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Taking QB Rick Mirer with the No. 1 pick was a no-brainer. The 
next no-brainer is getting Mirer signed to long-term deal. CB Carlton Gray, the 
No. 2, also showed promise. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Deep speed at wide receiver; defensive lineman to end double-teaming of 
Cortez Kennedy; upgrade on offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: If Mirer is signed, he and Kennedy provide 
offensive-defensive hubs that could turn Seahawks into playoff team. Signing of 
CB Nate Odomes helps, although free-agent trade involving T Howard Ballard and 
T Andy Heck may have been a wash at best. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Adams; Taylor; Williams; Young, Thierry or Alberts, if he's 
there. 9. Cleveland (7-9) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: C Steve Everitt, the first-round pick, became a starter 
immediately -- a rarity -- and could be a future All-Pro. DE Dan Footman, the 
No. 2, may develop but was a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: More offense. QB Vinny Testaverde remains a long-term question mark and 
there's no deep speed on the outside except RB Eric Metcalf. Cornerback, 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Uncertain. Bill Belichick has taken over everything and 
built a defense, but he hasn't really gotten past mediocrity despite a 
long-term committment from sometimes trigger-happy owner Art Modell. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: DE-LB Willie McGinest, Southern Cal; WR Charles Johnson, 
Colorado; Alberts, Thierry, Morton, Langham or Glenn, if he's there. 10. 
Arizona (7-9) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: RB Garrison Hearst, the top pick, injured a knee, but his 
replacement, fourth-rounder RB Ron Moore rushed for 1,018 yards. T Ernest Dye, 
the other first-round pick, had troubles but could develop. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Offensive line and secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Bill Bidwill seems inclined to let coach Buddy Ryan run 
the show, which means a winner, particularly since he's reincarnating the 
Eagles in Phoenix. But how long before Ryan alienates Bidwill, as he's done 
with every other owner he's worked for? 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: McGinest or Adamas because Ryan never has enough pass 
rushers; Williams, Langham, Glenn, Thierry, Alberts or Young. 11. Chicago (7-9) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: WR Curtis Conway, the top pick, developed slowly, although he 
still can become a legitimate deep threat. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: The Bears have been active on the free-agent market, but still need 
help on offensive and defensive lines and perhaps at running back, where RB Tim 
Worley and RB Lewis Tillman may not be full-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Dave Wannstedt impressed a lot of people in his debut as 
the coach. That bodes well, but just as important is whether QB Erik Kramer 
develops. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Taylor, McGinest, Adams, Williams, Johnson or Young. 4. New 
Orleans (8-8) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Probably the NFL's best -- OT William Roaf, already one of the 
best linemen in the league; TE Irv Brown, FB Lorenzo Neal and fourth-round RB 
Derek Brown. Neal was hurt after averaging more than 8 yards a carry in his 
first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Quarterback; replacements for aging trio of LB Sam Mills, LB Rickey 
Jackson and LB Vaughn Johnson, who have been mainstays for nearly a decade; and 
help on defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Jim Mora has more control and signing of WR Michael 
Haynes indicates a move away from the prevent offense Mora likes. But the aging 
defense needs shoring up. Organization is solid, but New Orleans fans are 
getting restless after mild success. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Adams, Thierry, McGinest, LB Jamir Miller, UCLA, G Wayne 
Gandy, Auburn, Young, Johnson or Morton. 13. New York Jets (8-8) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: LB Marvin Jones was just coming into his own when he dislocated 
his hip. RB Adrian Murrell, a fifth-rounder, looked like a prospect in limited 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Wide receivers, pass rushing linebacker or defensive end, young 
safeties and offensive line 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Jets seem to be spinning around the .500 mark and below, 
changing coaches every few years and stigmatized as "second team" in New York 
behind the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Morton, Johnson, Williams, Gandy, Miller or WR Derrick 
Alexander, Michigan. 14. Philadelphia (8-8) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Had two No. 1 picks, and G Lester Holmes became a starter in the 
second half of the season, but DT Leonard Renfro had little immediate impact in 
defensive line. WR Victor Bailey, second-rounder, emerged as promising receiver 
and free agent RB Vaughn Hebron was pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Defensive line, safeties, offensive line. Linebackers with departure of 
Seth Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: New owner Jeffrey Lurie may manage to check the mass 
defections by players unhappy with Norman Braman. Coach Rich Kotite did a 
remarkable job getting injury-riddled team to .500 last year, but that can't 
last long. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Gandy, Williams, Taylor, Morton, McGinest or Miller. 
15./23. San Francisco (10-6) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Two No. 1 picks: DT Dana Stubblefield, who was defensive rookie of 
the year and LB Todd Kelly, a disappointment. Best of the rest may have been 
seventh-rounder DE Troy Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Defensive linemen and linebackers -- of six defensive players taken 1-2 
since 1990, only Stubblefield has produced; young offensive linemen for 
not-too-deep and aging unit. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: A 10-6 record and a loss in the NFC title game was viewed 
as disappointing. The defense needs rebuilding and the salary cap is hurting 
the 49ers, for years the NFL's highest-spending team. Still, a team with 11 
straight seasons of double-digit wins isn't exactly hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: LB Ken Norton cuts down need for linebacker. Gandy a 
possibility or could parlay two No. 1s to move up for a lineman. Adams fits 
mold of picks like DL Dennis Brown and DL Ted Washington. McGinest, T Todd 
Steussie, California; DT Brentson Buckner, Clemson; DB Thomas Randolph, Kansas 
State; DL Romeo Bandison, Oregon. 16. Miami (9-7) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: First pick KR-WR O.J. McDuffie was excellent return man and good 
receiver. RB Terry Kirby was a third-round steal. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Defensive backs, particularly if CB Troy Vincent doesn't make it back 
from knee injury; linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Wayne Huizenga, who just bought the team, left a bit of 
uncertainty about Don Shula's future. With Jimmy Johnson available and the 
Dolphins his dream job, the uncertainty increases. But the future is safe in 
the hands of either one. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: LB Aubrey Beavers, Oklahoma, CB DeWayne Washington, North 
Carolina State, Gandy or Williams. 17. Pittsburgh (9-7) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: CB Deon Figures contributed as a nickel back and LB Chad Brown, 
the second pick, started. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Replacement for FB Merril Hoge, departed free agent; a speedy wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Bill Cowher has gotten the Steelers to the playoffs his 
first two years. Now the question is whether he becomes a Marty 
Schottenheimer-Jim Mora type who gets them there but rarely beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Johnson, Morton, WR David Palmer, Alabama, FB William 
Floyd, Florida State. 18./19. Minnesota (9-7). 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: RB Robert Smith, the first pick, was a breakaway threat when 
healthy, which wasn't often. Fifth-rounder T Everett Lindsay became an instant 
starter and improved as the season wore on. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Younger blood at wide receiver, running back depth, quarterback, and 
offensive and defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Green, like Cowher, has had the team in the playoffs two 
straight seasons. He's also taking more control in the front office. So far so 
good, but it's time to move up a notch and two No. 1s can help. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICKS: Floyd, Palmer, Morton, Steussie, OT Tre Johnson, Temple, 
DT Tim Bowens, Mississippi. Trade up. 20. Green Bay (9-7) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: LB Wayne Simmons, the first first-rounder, was hurt but became a 
starter late. S George Teague, taken with the last pick, became a starter at 
midseason and was a plus. QB Mark Brunell, a fifth rounder, is a prospect but 
may leave as a free agent if he's any good rather than stay behind QB Brett 
Favre. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Running back; wide receiver to take pressure off WR Sterling Sharpe; 
replacements for departed LB Tony Bennett and retired LB Brian Noble. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Ron Wolf and Mike Holmgren have done a good rebuilding 
job and Holmgren of all the successful coaches from the class of '92, Holmgren 
looks like the one who could take his team beyond the opening couple of playoff 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: RB Greg Hill, Texas A&M, RB Mario Bates, Arizona State, 
Palmer, Morton or Alexander. 21. Detroit (10-6). 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: CB Ryan McNeil, the first pick in the second round became a 
starter late in the season. The first pick went for LB Pat Swilling, who didn't 
make the impact he made in New Orleans, but still helped. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Cornerback; more speed at wide receiver; pass-rusher, as always. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Despite two division titles in three years and the 
signing of QB Scott Mitchell, there's a question mark here. Wayne Fontes' 
tenure as head coach remains shaky and absentee owner William Clay Ford 
sometimes steps in via general manager Chuck Schmidt to move pawns around. 
That's not usually a long-term formula for success. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Washington, Randolph, Alexander, Beavers or DE William 
Gaines, Florida. 22. Raiders (10-6) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: DB Patrick Bates, the top pick, was only a nickel back. But 
eighth-round RB Greg Robinson was an instant starter and free-agent WR James 
Jett was an instant deep threat. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Linebacker, running back depth, replacement DT Howie Long. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Al Davis' style worked last year, thanks to the addition 
of Jett and free-agent QB Jeff Hostetler and the emergence of WR Tim Brown. A 
team with real strengths, like the pass rush and deep passing but also real 
weaknesses like running back and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Hill, Bates, Floyd, Beavers, Bowens, Steussie, Tre Johnson; 
G Isaac Davis, Arkansas. 23. New York Giants (11-5) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Top pick DE Mike Strahan, in the second round, was hurt in 
training camp, but remains a potential pass-rushing threat. LB Marcus Buckley 
(No. 3) and LB Jessie Armstead (No. 8) contributed, and the rookie free agent 
crop was good. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Pass rushers, defensive back and, as always, speed receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Organization remains one of the NFL's most solid and Dan 
Reeves' coaching got them back to playoffs. Had best free-agent class in league 
and skill in front office will probably keep them playoff team in era when 
personnel judgements are key. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Beavers, Alexander, Randolph, Gaines, DE Henry Ford, 
Arkansas. 25. Kansas City (11-5) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: No pick until third round, but used it for G Will Shields, who 
became an instant starter and could be future Pro Bowler. LB Jaime Fields, No. 
4, was also a contributor and will start this year. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Consistency at wide receiver, defensive backs and offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: He's not the most popular guy among his peers, but GM 
Carl Peterson has done wonders in building team. Marty Schottenheimer has been 
to three AFC title games and in playoffs eight of his nine seasons, but is he a 
guy who can't get over the hump? 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Washington, Randolph, Alexander, Scott, Steussie, Tre 
Johnson; S Jeff Burris, Notre Dame. 26. Houston (12-4) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Brad Hopkins, the No. 1, became a starter at left tackle, the 
toughest place to play on the offensive line. No. 2, LB Micheal Barrow, 
contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Young blood for the offensive line, receiving depth. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Finishing the year with 11 straight wins wasn't good 
enough for the Oilers, whose annual playoff swoon came in their first game -- 
and at home. This is a team weak at owner with a lot of aging talent that's 
coming off a soap opera season. Losing Buddy Ryan won't help -- despite his 
battle with offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride, he made the defense a force. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Steussie, Tre Johnson, Scott, Buckner, or Davis. 27. 
Buffalo (12-4) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: CB Thomas Smith, the third defensive back taken No. 1 in four 
years, began playing at end of season and will replace departed free agent CB 
Nate Odomes. No. 4 WR Russell Copeland looked like promising receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Offensive linemen -- T Howard Ballard was second straight key starter 
to defect. Depth at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Excellent personnel evaluation system picks up low-round 
gems every year. But salary cap has cost free agents and they'll have to stop 
getting to Super Bowls some year. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Steussie, Tre Johnson, Davis, OT Marcus Spears, NW 
Louisiana, or Ford. 28. Dallas (12-4) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: No No. 1, but WR-KR Kevin Williams, the first No. 2, was a return 
man dangerous to both the Cowboys and opponents, and could be a third wide 
receiver. The other No. 2, OLB Darrin Smith, was outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: More defensive line depth. developmental offensive linemen, solid 
backup for RB Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Not as good as they seemed with Jimmy Johnson. Jerry 
Jones' ego is turning the Cowboys into a team weak at the crucial owner 
position, and the coaching staff, other than Barry Switzer, is likely to 
surface with Johnson a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Buckner, Davis, Steussie, Tre Johnson, Spears, Bates, Ford, 
or DE Joe Johnson, Louisville. 36. Atlanta (7-9) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: OT Lincoln Kennedy, the No. 1, had weight problems, but started 
late in the year. The rest of the picks were more suspect than prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Defensive size; depth at wide receiver because of 
run-and-shoot-offense. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Picking June Jones as coach means more of the 
run-and-shoot, which few NFL people think is a championship offense. Falcons 
have some talent and a fairly solid offense if QB Jeff George comes through, 
but you still have to stop the other guys to win. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Hard to project. Perhaps a big offensive lineman like 
Buckner or Bandison. No. 1 went in the trade for George. 42. San Diego (8-8) 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: First two picks, CB Darrien Gordon and RB Natrone Means were both 
excellent, although Chargers gave up this year's No. 1 to get Means on second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Wide receiver speed now that WR Anthony Miller has gone to Denver; 
depth for defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: Iffy. Owner Alex Spanos is not one to give free rein to a 
GM and Bobby Beathard may not last too much longer. Too bad. Despite backslide 
last year, the Chargers seemed to be making progress. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Too late to predict. 50. Denver (9-7). 
</P>
<P>
 1993 DRAFT: Dan Williams the top pick, played reasonably well but injured his 
knee at the end of the season; K Jason Elam, No. 4, may last two decades; RB 
Glyn Milburn, No. 2, was the kind of third down receiver-running back every 
team needs. 
</P>
<P>
 NEEDS: Cornerbacks: Raiders exploited an obvious weakness in three wins; 
offensive line help despite signings and trades from last year; wide receiver, 
although Miller is a valuable addition. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG-TERM PROSPECTS: A well-run team that will remain a contender until QB 
John Elway loses it. 
</P>
<P>
 LIKELY FIRST PICK: Too late to predict.

SAILING; CONNER IS FIRST IN RECORD TIME DESPITE HAVING TO RESTART RACE 
</P>

 Dennis Conner, sailing the 60-foot catamaran Stars & Stripes, recovered from a 
glitch at the start to break his own record in the 47th 125-mile 
Newport-Ensenada International Yacht Race. 
</P>
<P>
 Conner finished in 8 hours 29 minutes -- 38 minutes under the record -- 
despite losing 8 minutes 15 seconds Friday when he used the wrong starting line 
and had to restart.As the winds built from 6 to 12 knots, he soon overtook the 
rest of the fleet and even arrived half an hour ahead of the engine-powered 
committee boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Stars & Stripes is the soft-sail sister boat of the hard-sail catamaran built 
for the 1988 America's Cup defense. It sailed much of the race at 20 knots. 
However, its speed potential is rated so high that it still might not claim the 
trophy for the Ocean Racing Catamaran class, which is based on corrected 
handicap time. Stars & Stripes' handicap is minus 199, meaning it must spot its 
rivals upward of four minutes per mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Campbell's Andrews 70 Victoria was the first monohull to finish for the 
second consecutive year, crossing the line after 2 a.m. Saturday in 14 hours 12 
minutes. More than 150 of the 400 entries had finished by 2 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanee Butler, the 23-year-old Aliso Viejo woman who joined the race 
unofficially on a sailboard to promote her Olympic campaign, arrived in 
Ensenada exhausted at 6:15 p.m. Saturday night after spending 29 1/2 hours 
under sail. RICH ROBERTS

NORTHRIDGE SWEPT AWAY IN A HURRY; COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL: MATADORS LOSE IN THREE 
GAMES TO PEPPERDINE IN FIRST ROUND OF THE MOUNTAIN PACIFIC SPORTS FEDERATION 
TOURNAMENT AFTER A PAIR OF FOOT FAULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge was down two games to none, but to a man the Matadors 
thought they had Pepperdine on the ropes Saturday in the opening round of the 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation men's volleyball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 With the vision of a stirring Northridge comeback still fresh in the minds of 
both teams, the Matadors took Pepperdine to game point four times in the third 
game before a sparse crowd in Stanford's Maples Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 But given a toe, the Waves gave Northridge the boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Hewitt, the Matadors' senior middle blocker, had his serve twice negated 
by foot faults -- the second time with Northridge ahead, 14-12 -- and the Waves 
took advantage to rebound for a victory that completed a sweep, 15-8, 15-8, 
16-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine (14-8) will meet second-ranked Stanford (18-9) in the tournament 
semifinals Monday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge ended its season with a record of 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just gave it to them at the end of the third game," Northridge Coach John 
Price said. "Two foot faults? That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 The front of Hewitt's foot was barely over the line on both occasions, but 
against an old nemesis, Northridge was left with precious little margin for 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine, loser of both regular-season matches against the Matadors, was a 
far better squad than the one Northridge previously had seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They raised their level, but that's what you're supposed to do in the 
playoffs," said Price, whose team swept the Waves at Pepperdine in March and 
came back from a 2-0 deficit to win in five games at Northridge not two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we raise our level like we're supposed to, we beat that team." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor serving brought the Matadors down in the first game, erratic hitting in 
the second and ill-timed mistakes in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked a bad day to have a bad day," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet until the very end, the Matadors seemed poised for a comeback that never 
came. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we ever got a game or got over that hump, they would have been a different 
team with pressure on them," Price said of Pepperdine. "But we never put 
pressure on them. We made so many mistakes, we didn't allow them to make any." 
</P>
<P>
 Dain Blanton, a senior outside hitter, paced Pepperdine with a match-high 21 
kills and a .514 attacking percentage. Greg Shankle added 17 kills for the 
Waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Heitmann led Northridge with 19 kills and a .421 attacking percentage. 
Jon Baer added 14 kills, but he also had eight attacking errors and a 
percentage of only .207. 
</P>
<P>
 Baer sparked Northridge's previous victory over Pepperdine by coming off the 
bench to record 34 kills, 10 digs and nine blocks. This time he was a starter, 
replacing freshman Jason Hughes, who missed a week of practice with strep 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes replaced Baer with Northridge trailing, 9-2, in the second game. Hughes 
finished with seven kills and four blocks.

NORTHRIDGE BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS; COLLEGE BASEBALL: MATADORS RALLY, SCORE 
WINNING RUN IN THE NINTH ON NELSON'S BASES-LOADED, ONE-OUT SINGLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Was it a grin or a grimace? Either way, you could see many of Cal State 
Northridge first baseman Jason Shanahan's teeth as he scored the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd have been him, I'd have been calling my dentist," teammate Chad 
Thornhill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan almost redefined the term suicide squeeze when he scored the winning 
run from third base in the ninth inning as Northridge rallied to beat Cal State 
Sacramento, 7-6, Saturday in a Western Athletic Conference game at Matador 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out and the score tied, 6-6, Tyler Nelson stepped in with the bases 
loaded. Two batters earlier, Thornhill had drawn a walk from relief ace Steve 
Thobe (3-4) to force across the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge flashed the sign for the suicide squeeze. Shanahan bolted toward 
the plate and. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I missed the sign," Nelson said. "But at least I got it done." 
</P>
<P>
 He did just that, lining a sharp single past the charging Shanahan and into 
left field, keeping hope of a WAC West Division title alive for the Matadors 
(22-23, 10-7), who trail first-place San Diego State by 1 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better to be lucky than good, I guess," Thornhill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was neither in a 9-0 setback in the series opener and the Matadors 
stumbled through the early innings Saturday. They bunted into a double play in 
the fifth and scored the season's homeliest unearned run later in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill struck out on a checked swing, then stood motionless in the batter's 
box as catcher Jason Quintel fumbled around in the dirt for the ball. Shanahan, 
on second base, was the only guy in motion and he rounded third and headed for 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill finally jogged halfheartedly toward first. Quintel found the ball, 
set himself, then hit Thornhill between the numbers with his throw for an error 
as Shanahan scored to give the Matadors a 4-3 lead. Thornhill was still 20 feet 
from first when he was plunked. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento (21-21, 8-9) took a one-run lead in the ninth on a single by Ray 
Brown, his fifth hit off surprise starter Aaron D'Aoust, who allowed four 
earned runs and 15 hits. D'Aoust (7-3) got the starting assignment when Jason 
Vargas arrived late for the game. Utility man Brian Vasey rode the bench for 
the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "Late. Isn't that amazing?" Coach Bill Kernen said. "Is that a mind-boggling 
deal?" 
</P>
<P>
 So was the ninth, which included a bunt single from Keyaan Cook, who earlier 
bunted into a 1-5-3 double play on a sacrifice attempt. This time, he bunted 
past a stumbling Thobe to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Second bunt of my life," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three batters later, Nelson whistled one past Shanahan to end another funky 
chapter in Matador lore, circa 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "My eyes opened up a little bit (when the ball whizzed by)," Shanahan said. 
"Just another fun day at the yard."

SWEEP PUTS MISSION TWO STEPS CLOSER TO A CONFERENCE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They can almost smell it now. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission College pulled to within one victory of winning the Southern 
California Athletic Conference baseball title by sweeping Cerro Coso, 10-2 and 
8-7, Saturday at Mission in a battle between conference leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Free Spirit (24-14, 16-7 in conference play) defeats Cerro Coso (17-16, 
12-8) Wednesday at Ridgecrest it will clinch the championship in Mission's 
regular-season finale. The teams went into Saturday's doubleheader in a virtual 
tie for first place. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Free Spirit backed Cerro Coso into a corner with the two victories 
because the Coyotes trail by a game in the loss column. One defeat in their 
remaining four games would eliminate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission, which lost to Cerro Coso in their previous three games this season, 
got superb pitching from ace Ray Rivera (11-2) in the seven-inning opener and 
from Robert Ballester (6-2) in relief in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Spirit went to the long ball to support its pitchers, hitting four 
home runs, including one in each game by catcher Joey Gandara. And Derrick 
Ornelas came up with the key blow of the afternoon with a single that scored 
Gandara from third with the winning run in the bottom of the ninth in the 
second game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera, a freshman right-hander, mowed down the Coyotes in the first game, 
going the distance for the eighth time. He allowed nine hits, struck out seven 
and walked one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bigger the game, the better he gets," Mission Coach John Klitsner said of 
Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandara provided much of the support, going three for three with his first 
homer of the season, a double and two runs batted in to give Rivera breathing 
room. Center fielder Gary Matthews had a two-run homer and first baseman Rob 
Walley knocked in three runs with a bases-loaded double in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballester relieved John Romero in the third inning of the second game, when 
the Coyotes exploded for six runs to take a 6-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave up two hits in seven innings and allowed only one run on a 
ninth-inning sacrifice fly by Paul Bassett that tied the game, 7-7.

REILLY NURSES CUT, OUTLASTS ARCHULETA TO WIN DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pepe Reilly beat Randy Archuleta by unanimous decision in a four-round junior 
welterweight bout Saturday night at the Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Glendale resident wouldn't have won any beauty contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly, 22, suffered a bruised forehead and an inch-long gash above his left 
eye from a head butt in the second round. The gash bled for the rest of the 
bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerned me was my vision," said Reilly, who was rushed into the locker 
room for stitches immediately after the fight. "(Blood) kept getting in my eye 
and I couldn't see. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11 Reilly (6-1) had a height advantage, but he had trouble finding 
his rhythm in the first round against Archuleta (6-9), of Selma, Calif. Reilly 
found his mark in the second, connecting on a variety of body punches. He had 
Archuleta against the ropes when they accidentally butted heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the blood spurt out and it went right into my eye," Reilly said. 
"(Archuleta) kept coming in and I had a little trouble keeping him out because 
of the cut. I felt in control most of the night, but that changed everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The 140-pound Reilly had Archuleta staggering from a combination to the head 
in the third. However, the cut, which was bandaged, reopened and began bleeding 
even more heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few punches by either fighter the rest of the way. Reilly, his face 
and chest covered in blood, dodged Archuleta in the fourth round and had his 
stockier opponent chasing him around the ring. Reilly was merely nursing the 
cut until the final bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans didn't like it but I just tried to finish the fight," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly, who lost to Joshua Renteria in August, got his previous victories by 
knockout. Archuleta, who returned to boxing last year after a six-year layoff, 
has never been knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "My plan was to concentrate on his body," Reilly said. "I didn't getting 
excited about head punching because I knew he's never been down. The few times 
I hurt him was with body punches."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / JEFF FLETCHER: FRIDAY, WHEN HITTERS WERE STRONG-ARMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Must have been something in the air on Friday. Or maybe dead baseballs. Or 
umpires who called big strike zones. Whatever, there were a rash of excellent 
pitching performances in area games. The roll call: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jim Parque, Crescenta Valley. Parque gave up a bloop double to Glendale's 
Loren Geller, the second batter of the game, prompting yells from the Dynamiter 
dugout of "There goes the no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 The bench jockeys proved prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque finished with a 3-0 victory, 11 strikeouts, two walks and his third 
one-hitter of the season. In four varsity seasons, he has pitched more 
one-hitters than he can remember, but never a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will come sooner or later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * David Glick, Palmdale. Coaches don't like to hear that a pitcher is keeping 
count of his strikeouts during a game, but, as Glick said, "Sometimes you just 
can't help it." Friday, when Glick struck out 16 in an 8-2 victory over Quartz 
Hill, was one of those times. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fastball was going pretty good and a had pretty good tail to it," said 
Glick, a senior left-hander. "I knew (about the strikeouts) all along." 
</P>
<P>
 * Mike Vasquez, Moorpark. Vasquez struck out 15 and allowed four hits in the 
Musketeers' 9-1 victory, surprising when you consider that Vasquez averaged 6.1 
strikeouts in his nine previous games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of out of the blue," Coach David Rhoades said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brandon Mitchell and Rene Abeyta, Village Christian. Coach Mike Henzie 
planned before the game to give each pitcher some work. So, after Mitchell 
pitched four innings, enough to qualify for the victory, Henzie replaced him 
with Abeyta. 
</P>
<P>
 An inning later, a player approached Henzie and said, "Uh, Coach? I don't 
think they have a hit yet." Marshall Fundamental's batters were indeed hitless, 
and Abeyta kept it that way through the final three innings of a 4-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other notable performances Friday: Bill Scheffels of Simi Valley, an 
All-Southern Section pitcher last year who has been struggling recently, gave 
up only four hits in a 12-0 victory over Westlake; Notre Dame junior 
left-hander Andy Lutz pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings, striking out 11, in a 
5-0 victory over rival Crespi; Calabasas' Anthony Kaufman shut out Santa Clara 
for six innings and Josh Morton picked up the save in a 2-0 game by striking 
out the side in the seventh; Hart's Luis Sanchez struck out 10 in a 10-3 
victory over rival Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody check the balls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deja vu: The phone calls. The stopwatches. It all seems familiar to Keith 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like recruiting all over again," Smith said of the latest attention he's 
getting, this time from baseball scouts intent on making him a professional 
outfielder instead of a college quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 And Smith now admits it doesn't seem like such a crazy idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thinking about it a lot lately," said Smith, who has accepted a 
scholarship to play football at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was invited as a pitcher last summer to the Area Code Games, a showcase 
for high school baseball talent, but when his 60-yard dash readings were more 
impressive than those on the radar guns, interest began to change to Smith as 
an outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, Smith doesn't play outfield for Newbury Park. When he's not 
pitching, he plays shortstop. So Coach Gary Fabricius has sent Smith to the 
outfield during pregame warmups a few times, just for the scouts to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 They like what they have seen. Smith is above average in only two of the five 
"tools" scouts look for, but speed and arm strength just happen to be the only 
two that can't be taught. Scouts figure if they can get Smith playing baseball 
every day, they can teach him to hit, hit with power and play defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith could be picked as high as the second round, scouts say, but it will 
probably take at least a $100,000 bonus to get him to sign. He could, however, 
play pro baseball in the spring and summer and college football in the fall, 
and now he wonders if he could swing the two-sport thing. "It's all I've been 
thinking about," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What jet lag?: Just back from a family vacation in Australia, Camarillo middle 
blocker Drew Richards popped in to the Scorpions' gym -- during a volleyball 
match against Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Cornelius immediately had the 6-foot-1 senior suit up. Richards 
proceeded to help Camarillo crush the Pioneers, 15-5, 15-3, 15-2, in the final 
three games. Richards finished with 11 killss and seven blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he thought we had a practice at 3 o'clock," Cornelius said. "But he 
had a uniform, so maybe he did know. Anyway, I'm surprised he played as well as 
he did, because he was coming straight from Australia. You know, with the time 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he warmed up, he came on like gangbusters."

PHIPPS BRIGHTENS SAUGUS WITH MAIN-EVENT VICTORY

 Nothing could stop Dave Phipps Saturday night at Saugus Speedway. Not even the 
threat of a rainstorm could prevent the three-time defending Grand American 
Modified champion from winning his first feature race of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, it didn't matter. The rain never showed and Phipps, 46, 
cruised to an easy 40-lap main-event victory in a race started almost two hours 
early in an effort to avoid pending showers.  
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley resident started on the outside of the second row before 
passing Jim Marlweski, also of Simi Valley, on the inside of turn one on the 
sixth lap.  
</P>
<P>
 Phipps moved out to a full straightaway lead before being slowed by three late 
caution flags which enabled Canyon Country's John Watkinson III to close the 
gap.  
</P>
<P>
 But each time the race restarted, Phipps was able to move out to a comfortable 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decide when I want to go, so I'm able to get a little edge," Phipps said of 
the restarts. "That's really the only advantage the leader has." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of like a reverse of roles," said Watkinson, who outdistanced 
Phipps in similar fashion in the season opener three weeks ago. "It's just a 
matter of getting better breaks to fall your way." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkinson finished second, followed by Dave Blankenship of Reseda and Canyon 
Country's Rod Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 25-lap Street Stock oval main event, Greg Benner of Whittier ran away 
from the field and snapped points leader John Schultz's string of four 
consecutive feature victories.  
</P>
<P>
 Craig Jensen of Sunland won the 25-lap Pro Stock oval main event.

STEWART CONTINUES TORRID PACE WITH VENTURA VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tony Stewart took a step closer to his goal of winning both the USAC Western 
States Midget Championship and the USAC National Midget Championship by posting 
another convincing 30-lap main event victory Saturday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indianapolis native has three victories and three second-place finishes in 
six races this season, and has won two of the three events held at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gives Stewart 199 points this year, 48 more than John Cofer of 
Macdoel, although that margin probably won't hold up. For the next six weeks 
Stewart will chase the national title in a series of races in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start, it seemed Stewart might have his work cut out for him, as 
seven-time Western State champion Ron (Sleepy) Tripp started in the pole 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried going into the main about what trick I was going to pull out of 
my hat (on the start)," Stewart said. "There wasn't anything I could do to 
outsmart him. Just do the best I could and let the cards fall where they may." 
</P>
<P>
 Tripp jumped the gun at the outset, causing officials to order a restart. 
</P>
<P>
 On the restart, Tripp took the lead going into the first turn, but Stewart was 
close enough to bump Tripp out of his way and take command coming out of turn 
two, at which point the outcome was pretty much determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I jumped him the first time and they called it back, it gave him the 
better start," Tripp said. "But it still would have been tough to hold him 
back, because he's real fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix native Billy Boat, who won the feature race last week, put up a late 
charge to finish second -- one-third of a lap behind Stewart. Cofer was third 
after passing Tripp on the last lap.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands High improved her region record in the 
shotput to 48 feet 10 inches and Damon Blechen of Agoura set school marks in 
the boys' shotput and discus in the inaugural Ventura County Relays at Channel 
Islands High on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau's effort improved on her previous best of 47-0 1/4 set in the Mt.San 
Antonio College Relays a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She also won the discus with a throw of 133-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Blechen won the shotput and discus with marks of 55-7 and 160-6. BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany 7, Chaminade 5 -- Designated hitter Alex Peran capped a six-run

NORTH-SOUTH ALL-STAR BASKETBALL GAMES; TUSTIN'S DAVIS TIMES IT RIGHT FOR SOUTH; 
GIRLS: HER PLAY LATE HELPS PRODUCE A 74-72 VICTORY OVER THE NORTH TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Sarah Davis never considered herself a star on Tustin High's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 And she wondered if she would get a scholarship offer because she wasn't sure 
how the Scholastic Aptitude Test was going to turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, everything turned out all right. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven days after signing a letter of intent to Long Beach State, Davis put her 
signature on the 17th Orange County all-star basketball game Saturday at Orange 
Coast College, a 74-72 victory for a team of South County seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis didn't have star-quality statistics, but she had star-quality timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her play helped the South overcome a four-point deficit with 5 minutes 57 
seconds left. The play of the night came with 11 seconds to go when her steal 
of an inbounds pass at half court prevented the North team from taking a final 
shot. She was fouled, and her free throw with seven seconds left secured the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't the big standout at Tustin," said Davis, who averaged 12.2 points. 
"I felt I would be a contributor, but not a key person out here. I just went in 
and did what I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Her athleticism and defense in the first half ensured she would play a lot in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect her to be in the game at crunch time," South Coach Mary 
Mulligan, of San Clemente, said. "But in the first half, she proved this was 
her type of game -- scrappy, open court." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis finished with five points, two steals and two rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another low-profile player, Westminster's Lisa Tamamasui, had the basket that 
broke a 71-71 tie. Her shot with 20 seconds left put pressure on the North, 
which was loaded with post players. Mater Dei's Leticia Oseguera missed from 
underneath with 14 seconds remaining, but was fouled after the rebound. Needing 
two to tie the score, she made a free throw before Davis closed out the 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The South had a 60-51 lead with about 10 minutes remaining before the North 
rallied. The Brea-Olinda combination of Sarah Beckley and Colleen Hudson -- 
together in the game for the first time -- sparked an 11-3 run that made it 
67-63 for the North, and Katella's Chris Carrillo scored eight of her team-high 
15 points. But Beckley came out with 5:57 left and the South made up the 
difference within two minutes. A drive by Woodbridge's Jamie Oenning gave the 
South a 68-67 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo's third three-point basket tied it at 71 with 1:00 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills' Karun Grossman won a three-point shooting contest at halftime and 
said it helped her find her shooting touch. She was five of eight in the second 
half, had a game-high 21 points and 10 rebounds and was named the game's most 
valuable player.

TRACK AND FIELD / ORANGE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIPS; OETTINGER IS FOOTHILL'S ACE, 
FINISHING FIRST IN FOUR EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tara Oettinger's four-of-a-kind outplayed every trump card thrown her way 
Saturday at the Orange County Championships track and field meet at Trabuco 
Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foothill junior won four individual events while leading the Knights to a 
second-place finish in the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger began the day by posting a winning long jump of 18 feet 2 1/2 inches 
into a sizable head wind. The 400 meters, the event she has the least 
experience in, followed soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Oettinger did not disappoint, striding away from the field to win in 
57.72, the county's fastest time of the year and a personal best by three 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to stay with the fastest girl in the heat," Oettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to do it today because I was afraid it would affect my 200," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't hurt. Oettinger won the 200 in a wind-aided 25.17 and also the 
100 (12.43) and was selected sprinter of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her efforts, the Knights could not catch eventual team champion 
Esperanza, which scored 78 points. Foothill finished with 56. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foothill boys' team did win, beating Woodbridge, 55-47. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights were sparked by victories from John Bain (pole vault), Ethan Taub 
(800 meters) and Tony Garcia (110 high hurdles), in addition to a 3:20.45 
winning time in the 1,600-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge seniors Gary Young and Tony Muniz powered the Warriors into second, 
each scoring in two individual events and one relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Young defended his titles in the 100 and 200, winning in 10.76 and a 
wind-aided 21.60. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working on my turn," said Young, who outdueled Orange's Jeff 
Williams down the stretch. "If it came down to it, I wasn't going to let him 
pass me." 
</P>
<P>
 Young moved up to 12th on the all-time county list with his performance in the 
100. 
</P>
<P>
 Muniz finished second in the long jump (21-10), fourth in the triple jump 
(45-0) and ran the third leg on the Warriors' runner-up 1,600 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Edison's Julie Koudelka held off late-charging Tiffany Boykin of Laguna 
Hills to win the 800 in 2:16.41. Boykin was timed in 2:17.63. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Esperanza junior Courtney Pugmire, voted the meet's outstanding distance 
runner, outkicked teammate Carrie Caulkins to win the 1,500 in 4:41.98. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Orange senior Jaime Martinez further established his claim as the county's 
leading distance runner, dominating the 1,500 (3:56.89) and 3,000 (8:38.94). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tustin junior Reggie Curry rode the wind to a personal best 49-8 1/2 in the 
triple jump, winning by more than four feet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Saddleback brother combination Mel and Matt Lete swept the 300 intermediate 
hurdles, Mel taking first in 38.52; his twin, Matt, took second in 39.16. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Esperanza's Kristi Kierulff won the high jump (5-8 3/4) and was second in 
the long jump (17-9) and was selected field-event performer of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Canyon senior Troy Langley, who leads the county at 6-10 1/4, won the high 
jump (6-6).

NORTH-SOUTH ALL-STAR BASKETBALL GAMES; GONZALEZ THE GO-TO GUY AS SOUTH HOLDS 
OFF NORTH; BOYS: HUNTINGTON BEACH STAR NEARLY UNSTOPPABLE, FINISHES WITH 31 
POINTS, 13 REBOUNDS IN 105-93 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tony Gonzalez, that two-sport irresistible force, was his usual pillar of 
strength Saturday night. The competition was tougher, but he found the going 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Orange County all-star basketball game was over, Gonzalez -- 
Huntington Beach High School's own little bundle of bulk -- was in a typical 
spot, on a pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
 His 31-point, 13-rebound performance led the South to a 105-93 victory over 
the North at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play Huntington Beach this season, and after tonight, I'm glad we 
didn't," said North Coach Mike Murphy, who coaches Sonora. "He is something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, an All-Orange County selection in basketball and football, was a 
one-man gang much of the night. Never mind it was an all-star game, with dozens 
of other talented players. Gonzalez put on his normal stop-me-if-you-can show. 
</P>
<P>
 He made 12 of 19 shots, from post moves to outside jumpers. He drew a crowd, 
but he merely overpowered them. He had seven offensive rebounds, which led to 
12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Tony gets his hand on it, it's over," said South Coach Gordon Billingsley, 
who coaches Fountain Valley. "It's his rebound." 
</P>
<P>
 The North double- and triple-teamed him, but it wasn't enough. Gonzalez either 
plowed through defenders or shot over them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start your game inside, then work your way outside," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Murphy: "We told the guy guarding Tony not to look at the ball or other 
players. We told him to block out Tony like it was football. Well, we now know 
who the best football player was out on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's only mistake was a game-ending dunk, which came a second after the 
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a loose ball rolled toward Gonzalez. He reached down with one 
hand and picked it up, as if it was an orange, and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just reacted the only way I know how," Gonzalez said. "It was a loose ball, 
and I had to have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who is 6 feet 6, 230 pounds, also spent a good portion of the game 
guarding Mater Dei guard Miles Simon. Simon made six of 21 shots and was only 
two for 10 on three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez scored eight points in the first five minutes of the second half as 
the South extended its 45-38 halftime lead to 62-44. 
</P>
<P>
 The South maintained a double-figure lead until the final eight minutes. Then 
Simon, the Orange County player of the year, got hot. He scored 20 of his 23 
points in the second half and had 16 in the final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon and Pacifica's Chris Vlasic, who scored 22 points, pulled the North 
closer. Simon's three-pointer made it 84-82 with 4 minutes 11 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that Gonzalez got a little help. Santa Magarita's Brian Finneran 
scored 12 of his 17 in the final five minutes.

PREP SOCCER / SENIOR BOYS' ALL-STAR GAME; NORTH HOLDS OFF SOUTH, SCORES IN 
SECOND HALF FOR 3-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After a scoreless first half, the North team finally broke through to score 
three second-half goals and defeated the South, 3-0, in the Orange County Boys' 
Soccer Coaches Assn. all-star game Saturday at Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim goalkeeper Joel Vasquez put a noose around the South's potent scoring 
attack, and the North fullbacks, led by Ken Cody and Oscar Lara and a stingy 
defense, stepped in at crucial times to smother each South rally. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, it appeared as if neither team would be able to break through as 
South goalkeeper Pete Van de Ven knocked away each North scoring chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the Sunny Hills duo of Doug Howes and D.J. Buckley that put the 
North on the scoreboard six minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Howes, who was notified on Tuesday that he would be filling in for teammate 
Chris Roselli, took a pass down the right side until he spotted Buckley 
charging toward the left post. Howes fed his Lancer teammate perfectly and 
Buckley redirected the ball past Van de Ven. 
</P>
<P>
 After the South's two scoring chances hit the crossbar, the North cushioned 
its lead with 12 minutes left when Van de Ven and fullback Oscar Cisneros 
misplayed a long indirect kick from Cody. 
</P>
<P>
 Both players called for the ball at the same time, but then stopped and looked 
at each other. Meanwhile, Orange forward Hugo Regalado raced in, knocked the 
ball away from both players and fired into the open net for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The South made it 3-0 with under three minutes to play on a goal from Santa 
Ana Valley's Rafael Reynosa on an assist from Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate to win this game," North Coach Fred Leininger said. "Both 
teams played superb, but our shots found the back of the net."

ROUNDUP; LONGSHOT WINS THE ARKANSAS DERBY

<P>
 Although it was nothing like Rockamundo's 108-1 shocker a year ago, there was 
another surprise in the Arkansas Derby on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern, a Broad Brush colt, came from last to beat Blumin Affair by a neck in 
1:48 for the 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Robert Meyerhoff, trained by Richard Small and ridden by Garrett 
Gomez, Concern paid $43.40 for his third victory in 13 starts. Previously, he 
had four seconds and four thirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Goblin, adding Lasix after bleeding in the Remington Park Derby, set 
the pace and looked to be home free inside the final eighth of a mile. However, 
Concern and Blumin Affair -- ridden for the first time by Eddie Delahoussaye -- 
rallied together and overtook Silver Goblin, the 3-1 second choice, in the 
final yards. Silver Goblin finished three-quarters of a length behind Blumin 
Affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Ride The Rails, the 9-5 favorite, finished fourth, 1 1/2 lengths behind Silver 
Goblin. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern's handlers said the colt will skip the Kentucky Derby and return to 
Maryland.

PREP SWIMMING / FOOTHILL SWIM GAMES; EL TORO VICTORY, RECORDS STEAL SPOTLIGHT 
AT BIG MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When announcer Don Brandley told spectators at the 22nd Foothill Swim Games 
they would be witnessing some fast times at Foothill High, most in the stands 
seemed unfazed by the announcer's prediction. But at day's end, even Brandley 
was surprised at some of the times turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, four records were set, some nearly broken and some of the season's 
fastest times in Orange County were recorded at Saturday's meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In team competition, El Toro was first overall with 582 points. The Chargers 
were first in the girls' competition with 366 points. The boys finished fourth 
with 216. Los Angeles Loyola was first in the boys' competition with 302 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 15 Orange and Los Angeles county schools competed in finals and 
consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Wendy O'Brien, who won races in the 50 and 100 freestyle, set a meet 
record and came close to breaking another. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, a sophomore, broke the four-year 50-yard freestyle record of 
Capistrano Valley's Christy Carolin by seven-hundredths of a second, finishing 
in 23.93 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' 50 and 100 free were among the highlights of the meet. O'Brien and 
Katie Lowes of El Toro competed, both entering the meet with the county's top 
two times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could beat her in the 50 free," O'Brien said. "I had the record 
in the back of my mind, but my first concern was beating Katie." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's time in the 100 free (51.98), her lifetime best, was less than a 
tenth of a second off Lisa Jacob's 1992 record and is the fastest time recorded 
this year in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The second record was broken by Santa Ana Valley's Amber Wines, whose 100 
breaststroke time of 1:04.47, shattered the 10-year-old record of Fountain 
Valley's Amy Clark by more than a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the 50 and 100 free, the 100 breaststroke was expected to be a battle 
between Wines and Katie Simmons of El Toro. But when Wines dived off the block 
and came up ahead of the pack, it was apparent she was after more than a 
victory over Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to break the record, and I felt I could," said Wines, a sophomore. 
"It always nice to have Katie (Simmons) next to me because that will make me 
swim that much faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Carone, a double winner from Capistrano Valley, broke her 100 butterfly 
record set last year, swimming 58.76 in Thursday's preliminaries. She was off 
her record time, however, at Saturday's finals, taking first in 59.09. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Lezak of Irvine easily won the 50 (21.30) and 100 (47.30) freestyles. 
His time in the 50 free eclipsed the 1987 mark of Corona del Mar's Jeff 
Thomason (21.45). 
</P>
<P>
 Other double winners included Philippe Demers of Santa Margarita, who won the 
200 individual medley (1:56.15) and the 100 butterfly (52.20); Marina's Alison 
Mijares in the 200 (1:57.34) and the 500 freestyle (5:02.66) and Ben Odell of 
Loyola in the 100 backstroke (53.58) and the 200 freestyle (1:44.04). 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lezak and O'Brien collected the Steve Furniss Award, given to the 
outstanding boy and girl swimmer of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Though El Toro placed first in only one individual event and competed in two 
relays in the final heats, the Chargers were able to place many swimmers in the 
consolations and finals, which resulted in the girls posting the top score and 
the boys taking fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awesome on how well we did, considering that our swimmers are very 
tired," said El Toro girls' Coach Sheri Ross said. "This is a good meet to show 
us where we are at before CIF starts next month. And considering that our girls 
are not shaved and tapered, we did very good."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; RIVERSIDE GETS THE LAST BLAST, TOPS SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What started out as a Saddleback offensive celebration ended up as an 
impressive comeback for Riverside, which beat the Gauchos, 20-12, in an Orange 
Empire Conference baseball game Saturday at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback scored nine runs in the first inning, capped by Wade Jackson's 
grand slam. Sam Voita had a two-run home run earlier in the inning. The Gauchos 
got two more runs in the third and another in the fourth and were comfortably 
ahead, 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riverside started back with five in the fifth, including Peter Jenkins' 
grand slam. The home run chased starter Craig Ainsworth. It was the first start 
of the season for Ainsworth, who had shoulder surgery in January. He had nine 
strikeouts but walked four, including three in the fifth, before Jenkins' 
homer, which came on a three-and-two pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside took the lead in the seventh. Diego Rodriguez had a two-run triple 
to tie it, 12-12. He scored on Dennis Konrady's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside finished with 20 hits, including five doubles, a triple and four 
home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Jenkins' grand slam, Konrady hit a two-run home run in the third, 
Steve Hagen homered in the sixth and Mel Motley hit a two-run home run in the 
eighth. Motley entered in the seventh and finished with three hits and drove in 
five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson had three hits and drove in five runs and Ted Wilkes and Voita had two 
hits and drove in two runs for Saddleback. Lorne Rosas had three hits for the 
Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside (27-8) is 14-5 in conference and in first place by a half-game over 
Cypress, which had a bye Saturday. The teams meet Tuesday at 2:30 at Cypress. 
Saddleback is 20-12-1, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West 4, Fullerton 2 -- Phil Ruhl scored in the eighth on a single by 
Garrett Vitale to break a 2-2 tie for visiting Golden West (15-17, 8-11), which 
won its second consecutive game. It was the fourth consecutive loss for 
Fullerton (16-17-1, 7-12), which fell to sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 15, Orange Coast 8 -- Jason Minici was three for four with 
four runs batted in and a three-run homer in the seventh that gave Rancho 
Santiago the lead for good. Jaime Estrada and Daryle Ward also homered for the 
Dons, who improved to 29-9 and 12-7 in conference. Mando Fanseca was three for 
five with a double and two runs scored for Orange Coast, which drops to 8-25 
and 2-17.  
</P>
<P>
 In a nonconference softball game: 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 3, Palomar 2 (10) -- Cypress scored the winning run with one out on a 
fielding error on a ball hit by Alison Murphy. It was the ninth consecutive 
victory for the Chargers (37-14), who lost to Palomar in the State title game 
last season. Cypress got two in the seventh on a two-out single by Briana 
Yoshina. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 298th victory for Cypress Coach Brad Picker. He has a mark of 
291-119 and is in his eighth season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ojai tennis tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Steen Lundblad and Erik Berg lose in quarterfinals -- Lundblad 
and Berg won their first match, 6-2, 6-2, then fell in their second match, 6-4, 
6-4, in the quarterfinals. Jeremy Driscoll and Tim Morstad lost in their 
opening match of the quarterfinals, 6-1, 6-0. STEVE KRESAL

CHILD, 2, BECOMES VICTIM IN NEW YORK 'WAR ZONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDIE GLAVE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first warm day after a long, snow-filled winter, Tonya Muldrow thought 
her 2-year-old son deserved some fresh air. She watched as he walked down the 
block, hand-in-hand with a teen-age friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I didn't want him to go," she said, crying softly. "A family 
friend, Anisha, said she was taking him to a birthday party, but a part of me 
said, 'Tell her no.' But he had been inside so long. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Anisha never went to the party. She took Dontae to the Stapleton housing 
project, about a half-mile from his home. They were "just hanging out" when the 
pop-pop-pop of gunfire punctuated the Staten Island afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-simmering dispute over a girl and a gun had detonated. Authorities say 
four men exchanged shots; Dontae Hawkins was caught in the cross-fire, 
transformed in an instant from innocent child to innocent victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The memories burn in Tonya's mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * The phone call from Anisha. "There's been a shooting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anisha sitting in the hospital waiting room, covered with Dontae's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dontae lying on the adult-size hospital gurney, just out of surgery, looking 
drained and lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, the little boy's hospital room is crowded with cheerful balloons 
and rows of stuffed animals from well-wishers. Barney is there; Big Bird and 
Mickey too. A red fire truck is nestled at the foot of the metal crib. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dontae has little interest in any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Owwwwwww!" he cried, his head tossing fitfully from side to side. "It hurts! 
It hurts!" 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have taken him off pain killers and the throbbing that is part of the 
healing process has taken over. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors say a single bullet tore through the 2-year-old's right hand and 
traveled diagonally through his tiny body, exiting on his left side. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost a kidney, and emergency surgery saved a badly damaged pancreas and 
spleen. But the worst news came several days after the March 13 shooting: The 
bullet had severed nerves in the child's lower spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
 The curly-haired toddler has regained feeling in his right leg but has little 
use of the left. Some permanent paralysis is certain, said Dr. Oded Preis, head 
of pediatric intensive care at Staten Island University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, Dontae will walk again with the use of a leg brace or a walker. At 
worst, he'll need a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 "What hurts, Boopie? Tell me what hurts," his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My body," the little boy replied, his eyes squeezed tightly closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To a generation of inner-city children, the report of gunfire is as familiar 
as the hum of a refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City, the shooting of children is literally a daily occurrence. 
Last year, 449 children under age 16 were shot -- 19 fatally, according to 
police statistics. Eighty-nine child victims were innocent bystanders like 
Dontae, in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 It is exaggerating just the slightest bit to say these children are growing up 
in a war zone. The day after Dontae was shot, Tonya went home to shower and 
change clothes. She heard the gunshots again. An 18-year-old had been killed in 
what was said to be a drug dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew him," she said. "And now there's talk all over the buildings about 
what his brother's gonna do to get even. It never ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine days later in the Bronx, a 19-year-old was accidentally shot to death in 
a dispute between two boys over a softball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, a Brooklyn girl was caught in the cross-fire of feuding crack 
dealers -- shot fatally through the heart while sitting on a project stoop. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Muldrow lived with the fear her son might meet the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it might happen when he got older, when I didn't have as much 
control over him," she said. "Not when he's 2, not when he's just a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 But even before his third birthday, the boy knew all about gunfire. His mother 
had taught him how to respond when the popping noises started outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we hear the gunshots starting -- Dontae thinks they're firecrackers -- 
we go to this wall in my house and sit down," Tonya said. "He sits there 
quietly and we wait until they stop." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya, 23, is a welfare mother; Dontae is her only child. She has lived in the 
Park Hill projects since she was 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Hill is a typical inner-city project: Crowded, dirty and dangerous, even 
in daylight. Illegal guns and drugs are a constant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was OK for me. I was used to the gunshots, the drugs," she whispered, 
holding her son's bandaged little hand. "I didn't want to live like that. But I 
was used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dontae's father, Lamar Hawkins, 23, is another child of the projects. He's an 
aspiring rapper whose group, the Wu-Tang Clan, is enjoying early success. His 
presence in Dontae's life is sporadic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's on the road a lot," Tonya said. "You know, trying to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya once tried to make it too. She went to a city-run college on Staten 
Island -- her tuition was free -- and studied computer science. She knew 
education was the key to getting out. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she got pregnant and dropped out. When her son arrived in October, 
1991, Tonya created a timetable for getting her life back on track: she would 
wait until Dontae was 2 1/2 and old enough for day care. 
</P>
<P>
 He will reach that milestone this month in a hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I planned to get a temp's job and go back to school nights, weekends, 
whatever it took. I had a plan," she said, brushing away tears. "Now, I have to 
get a new one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These days, a parade of doctors, nurses and interns march in and out of Dontae 
Hawkins' life. "He's actually real tired of all the attention and just wants to 
go home," Tonya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors say that day is weeks, maybe months, away.

 Dontae understands what happened to him. "The little boy got shot," he told 
his grandmother, Deborah Muldrow. "The bad boys. They shot me." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't understand why he can't move. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's used to being hyper," his mother said, flashing a quick smile as she 
remembered a child in constant motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day, I think, was the first time it hit him that something was 
wrong," she said. "He tried to get up from the bed and yelled, 'I'm stuck. Help 
me, I'm stuck.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya's days are interminable. She sleeps sporadically on a blue plastic 
lounge chair next to her son's hospital crib. The room is strewn with 
newspapers, magazines, empty pizza boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 She goes home only to shower and change. Her mother or 18-year-old sister, 
Tamika, fill in when she leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, with skin the color of fine milk chocolate and long, curly 
eyelashes, sleeps erratically but even then cries out in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya struggles to contain her anger at the young men who caused this. All 
four, ranging in age from 18 to 23, have been charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to ask them, 'How could you be so stupid? What were you thinking?' " 
she said. "But I already know what they would say. They'd say, 'The people 
should know what to do -- get down.' But my boy, he's a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 She knows one of the four: "I used to do his mother's hair. . . . She's not a 
bad mother and he's not a bad kid. He just fell in with the wrong crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, where I live, that's what it's all about. Proving yourself. If you 
don't do it (own a gun), you're a punk, a sucker. It makes them feel, I don't 
know, like a man. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I have to get out (of the projects). I don't want him to grow and 
be like the guys who shot him." 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes for a new, safer place to live, "maybe even something with a back 
yard." Together, she and her mother have enough money to rent an apartment in a 
private house. Now, they have to find someone who will rent to them -- no easy 
task. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not because we're black. It's because we come from Park Hill," she said. 
"People see that and are afraid. I can't really blame them."

BALD EAGLE SCRAMBLES TO ESCAPE EXTINCTION; RAPTORS: SINCE 1974, WITH FEWER THAN 
1,600 NESTING ADULTS, THE POPULATION HAS MORE THAN QUADRUPLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There are days here when the wind blows fresh, the sky is blue and the light 
glints in glorious flashes off the chop in the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the days to envy Deborah Melvin, a biologist for the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service whose weekly duties include piloting a battered green skiff up 
and down the river in search of bald eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 It is agreeable work on days like this, and there is an added payoff: Year 
after year, the job gets easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one," Melvin shouted excitedly one day recently from her perch at the 
wheel of the boat. She pointed skyward and shoreward, toward the horizon above 
sycamores and loblolly pines. 
</P>
<P>
 There, an eagle looped majestically in an upward spiral. The white head and 
tail caught the sun; the broad, serrated wings waved slowly in silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
 Another followed; the two were a nesting pair. Up and up they soared, almost 
out of view, until it seemed easy to believe that they could gaze out over the 
rooftops of Washington, D.C., 18 miles north, and watch over the Capitol of the 
land they were chosen to symbolize in 1782. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really kind of amazing," Melvin observed. "Most people don't realize we 
have this kind of wildlife so close to the nation's capital." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It does seem remarkable, especially considering that eagles had all but 
vanished here 20 years ago. But the eagle is bouncing back, not just here, in 
the suburban shadow of the capital, but throughout most of the lower 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
 From the brink of extinction in 1974, when there were fewer than 1,600 adult 
nesting eagles counted in the continental United States, the eagle population 
has more than quadrupled. Today, the number of nesting adults exceeds 7,000. 
Young birds aren't counted; if they were, the numbers would be far higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The revival has been so successful that the Fish and Wildlife Service is 
expected to announce soon that the bald eagle will be taken off the endangered 
species list. 
</P>
<P>
 The eagle would remain on the less-urgent threatened species list, but the 
"downlisting" would represent one of the greatest successes of the federal 
Endangered Species Act of 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Or would it? 
</P>
<P>
 Most environmentalists and wildlife biologists agree that the 1973 ban on the 
pesticide DDT, not the Endangered Species Act, was the single most important 
step toward saving the eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies in the 1960s showed that the pesticide caused birds to lay unusually 
thin and fragile eggs, which naturally reduced the number of successful 
hatchings. After the pesticide was banned, surveys showed the numbers of bald 
eagles and other raptors beginning to increase almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Some opponents of the environmental movement go further and say the Endangered 
Species Act, which comes up for renewal in Congress this year, had virtually 
nothing to do with the eagle's renaissance. They say the act should be scaled 
back -- or scrapped altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole notion that the Endangered Species Act did that is just baloney," 
insisted Ron Arnold, one of the founding fathers of the Wise Use Movement, an 
anti-environmentalist coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The renaissance of the bald eagle, he said, "was because of the good will of 
just ordinary people, not because of some goody-two-shoes environmental 
organization." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Deborah Melvin wears heavy, mud-splattered boots, the better to navigate the 
late-winter muck at Mason Neck. She has ruddy cheeks, blond hair and the rugged 
gait of someone at home in the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 She agrees that private citizens have helped save the eagle. Every year, towns 
all over the country hold bald eagle festivals, raising money and awareness to 
help the birds survive. Private groups have set aside land; private landowners 
have spared nesting habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 She agrees, too, that the DDT ban was the critical turning point for the 
eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she argues, the eagle revival was nurtured by the Endangered Species 
Act and other cornerstones of environmental regulation such as the Clean Water 
Act and Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have the protection of the habitat, I don't think we'd have the 
comeback we see today," she said. "Water quality, air quality -- it all comes 
into play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge was the first federal refuge created 
specifically to protect the bald eagle. It was established on Feb. 1, 1969, at 
the tip of a knobby peninsula along the Potomac's murky journey to Chesapeake 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Bald eagles had been protected, in one way or another, since 1940, when 
Congress passed the Bald Eagle Protection Act, essentially outlawing hunting of 
eagles. Prior to that, "there is a lot of documentation of just outright 
slaughter," said to Jody Millar, who coordinates bald eagle protection in the 
Midwest for the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Congress passed the Endangered Species Preservation Act, the 
forerunner of the 1973 act. It listed the "Southern bald eagle," a subspecies 
in the Southern United States that is no longer recognized as separate from 
Northern bald eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, bald eagles had flourished throughout the United States and 
Canada. (In Alaska, in fact, they remain abundant and have never been 
considered endangered.) 
</P>
<P>
 And although many Americans may have visions of the eagle swooping over a 
snowcapped peak, the fact is that the two greatest centers of bald eagle 
population in the continental U.S. were -- and still are -- Florida and the 
Chesapeake Bay region. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge lies on the fringe of the Chesapeake, 
and is an important migratory stopover for birds cruising the Eastern Seaboard. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey in 1974, the earliest one available, turned up only one nesting pair 
of bald eagles at the refuge. Last year, there were 10, plus several dozen 
migratory birds that spent the winter or summer at Mason Neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important area in that it supports both a wintering and a summering 
population," said Mitchell Byrd, a professor emeritus of biology at the College 
of William and Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 By Deborah Melvin's reckoning, the most important thing Mason Neck has done is 
simply exist. By setting aside about 2,300 acres of prime eagle habitat and 
protecting it from development, the Fish and Wildlife Service has given the 
eagles an oasis in the midst of fast-spreading suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government's role has not been entirely passive. "Everything we do 
here, we first consider the impact on the bald eagle," Melvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting under the authority of the Endangered Species Act, the federal agency 
has coordinated eagle management on adjoining and nearby state parks and a 
Colonial-era historic site. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Melvin's guidance, the wildlife service has nurtured the gangly oaks, 
pines and sycamores that eagles use for their nests here. New trees have been 
planted; soil erosion has been checked. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, and significantly, Melvin has worked with private landowners in the 
area to encourage them to respect and protect eagle habitat. "Obviously, the 
government can't keep buying up land forever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most landowners are cooperative; others are not. The latter are the natural 
constituency of the Wise Use Movement and groups like it that would put an end 
to the Endangered Species Act and its prohibitions on harming endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 One such advocate, Troy Mader of the Wyoming-based Abundant Wildlife Society, 
insisted that private landowners should be allowed to do what they want with 
wildlife on their land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say, hey, we've got to get out and manage these things," Mader said. "We 
consider predators as part of the wildlife chain, although kind of like a weed 
in a garden -- you don't go out and wipe them out, but you have to control 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mader went further, questioning whether the eagles had ever been endangered, 
and whether DDT actually harmed the birds. This argument has been made by 
others, including the late Washington state governor, Dixie Lee Ray. 
</P>
<P>
 Few, if any, reputable scientists agree. "It's irrefutable, as far as the role 
DDT played," said Byrd, the biologist who is considered one of the foremost 
experts on the bald eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although DDT is no longer a threat, Byrd is worried about the future of the 
eagle. He credits the Endangered Species Act with giving the eagle "an exalted 
status" and fears that the downlisting of the eagle, along with continuing 
encroachment on its habitat, will threaten the bird once more. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's true, what's the future of other, less-exalted creatures? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is the bald eagle, the bird that spreads its wings on every 
dollar bill, that stands before the President every time he speaks, that 
emblazons every U.S. passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife biologists wryly refer to such high-profile species as "charismatic 
megafauna." Other such celebrities of the animal kingdom include the peregrine 
falcon, the whooping crane, the American alligator and the California condor -- 
all of which the Endangered Species Act is credited with saving. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government spends nearly $25 million a year to save the bald 
eagle, and lesser but still impressive amounts on the other "megafauna." 
</P>
<P>
 "The plants and invertebrate species that nobody's ever heard of . . . they 
don't get any money at all," complained Randall Snodgrass, director of wildlife 
policy for the National Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, according to Snodgrass, 34 species have quietly become extinct after 
being on the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the government nor anyone else is likely to spend $25 million to save 
the likes of the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, the shortnose sturgeon or the 
Missouri bladderpod, all of which are on the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people would say it's just as well. Americans have made it clear -- and 
who could argue? -- that the bald eagle is higher on their priority list than 
the hapless bladderpod (which is, incidentally, a plant in the mustard family). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Off the Mason Neck peninsula, Deborah Melvin is guiding her boat through the 
river. A grand menagerie fills the cloudless sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Great blue herons flap by like gangly airborne sticks. Little mergansers zip 
frenetically over the water. Sea gulls cruise effortlessly above. 
</P>
<P>
 As the boat slips past a thin sheet of ice and into the mouth of a creek, 
Melvin and an intern, Collin Smith, spot a bald eagle sitting vulture-like at 
the spindly top of a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 As the boat gets closer, the eagle lifts off the branch and dives onto the 
water's surface, grabs a fish -- a shad or perch -- and then drops it. It 
swoops up to another tree to contemplate the missed opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes, it makes another try. This time, it comes up with the 
fish. Melvin cheers it on. 
</P>
<P>
 "God," she says finally, "he's gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
 The bird roosts on an overhanging branch for a minute. Then it lifts off and 
heads skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three miles away, cars inch along in rush-hour traffic on I-95. The parking 
lots are full at the new strip malls along US 1, the Jefferson Davis Highway. 
Commuters are starting to come home to the ranch homes and condominiums that 
have sprouted like mushrooms all through these woods. 
</P>
<P>
 The bird keeps rising, higher and higher above creek and river and wooded 
hills. Its features recede until finally it is a black speck, no longer 
recognizable, no longer a thing of wonder. And then it is gone altogether, 
slipped out of sight.

TAMIL TIGERS TURN SRI LANKA INTO STATE OF TERROR; ASIA: VIOLENT SEPARATISTS 
SEEK INDEPENDENT STATE ON ISLAND NATION, AND ARE WILLING TO SLAUGHTER WHOLE 
VILLAGES AND SUICIDALLY BLOW UP HEADS OF STATE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE IT. GROUP 
ALSO IS SUSPECTED OF KILLING INDIA'S RAJIV GANDHI.

 They wear combat fatigues and poison necklaces. They kill without mercy -- 
sometimes entire villages, including women and children -- and then fade into 
the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they blow themselves up along with their intended victims. Thin 
black ropes coiled around their necks conceal cyanide capsules, which they 
swallow when captured. 
</P>
<P>
 By any standard, Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are among the 
most fanatical of the world's aggressive ethnic separatist organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tamil Tigers are an extremely violent organization," said a State 
Department official. "They operate in cities and the countryside, and their 
list of assassinations is impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1983, when the Tigers took over an independence movement among the Tamil 
peoples of northern Sri Lanka -- the ancient land of Ceylon -- as many as 
40,000 people have died, victims of both the Tigers and military death squads 
sponsored by a government that is also fighting a pro-Communist movement in the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 "Separatist groups like the Tamil Tigers have no international forums in which 
to resolve their disputes in a peaceable manner," V. Rudrakumaran said. "That's 
why they resort to arms." Rudrakumaran, a native of Jaffna, a city on the Sri 
Lankan peninsula of the same name in the north, is a Tamil sympathizer who 
practices law in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudrakumaran said that because the Tigers lack international recognition, such 
organizations as the United Nations have not become involved in helping to 
settle the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, with an estimated force of 10,000 armed combatants, want a 
separate autonomous state carved out of traditional Tamil lands in the north of 
the island nation, along with a contiguous area in the east that contains a 
valuable port and rich agricultural lands. "Eelam" is the old Tamil word for 
Ceylon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sri Lankan government might be persuaded to allow a Tamil state on the 
Jaffna Peninsula, but the government is unlikely to yield the eastern 
territory, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief leader of the guerrillas, Velupillai Prabakaran, is not considered 
likely to risk face-to-face negotiations with the government, because in 
addition to masterminding the bloody warfare, he is sought by both Indian and 
Sri Lankan authorities for the assassinations of many high-ranking officials. 
They include former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President 
Ranasinghe Premadasa. 
</P>
<P>
 The elusive warlord remains entrenched in Jaffna, which has been ravaged by 
years of siege. The guerrillas rule the peninsula as a totalitarian state, with 
checkpoints and a network of informants who keep track of outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers and those they control live in squalor, without running water, 
electricity or sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tamils point to a long history of oppression by the government, which is 
dominated by another ethnic group, the Sinhalese. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of the country's 15 million people are Sinhalese, who are 
mostly Buddhists. Ceylon became independent from Britain in 1948 and took the 
name Sri Lanka, a Sinhalese word, in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The predominantly Hindu Tamils make up 18% of the population. The remaining 7% 
are Tamil-speaking Arab Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Roots of the present struggle go back centuries, when there was a Tamil 
kingdom in the north and two Sinhalese kingdoms in the south. To simplify 
administration, in 1883 British bureaucrats brought the areas together into one 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 After independence, the British left a constitution that provided safeguards 
for ethnic and religious minorities. But a socialist government dominated by 
the Sinhalese -- who claimed that the British had long favored the Tamils over 
them -- soon began dismantling these guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamils complain that they have been reduced to the state of beggars in their 
own land, systematically discriminated against in education and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has made some concessions to the Tamils in the last several 
years, but the separatists refuse to lay down their arms until they are free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers launched the current insurgency in 1983, when they pushed aside or 
consolidated several other separatist groups and became the single organization 
willing to wage war on the government. 
</P>
<P>
 During the insurrection's early stages, India, a largely Hindu country with a 
sizable segment of ethnic Tamil peoples, allowed the Tigers to carry on 
training and establish weapons depots in the state of Tamil Nadu. 
</P>
<P>
 This support was withdrawn in the late 1980s. Under an agreement signed by 
Indian Prime Minister Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Junius Jayewardene, an 
Indian peacekeeping force occupied northern and eastern Sri Lanka from 1987 to 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the Tigers' consent, India and Sri Lanka imposed a cease-fire in the 
civil war and agreed to some steps toward greater home rule in Tamil areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, who considered the accord a sellout by India, never joined in the 
cease-fire. After suffering some 1,000 casualties from both Tamil and Sinhalese 
extremists, the Indian troops left Sri Lanka, and fighting continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi, by then considered an archenemy, was assassinated, presumably by a 
Tiger extremist, in 1991 as he campaigned for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, Sri Lankan President Premadasa pursued a mixed policy. While 
modifying some anti-Tamil laws and cracking down on Sinhalese chauvinism, he 
simultaneously increased military pressure on Tamils in the north and east. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 Premadasa was assassinated by another suicide bomber believed to have 
been a Tamil Tiger. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting has continued sporadically. The Tigers employ classic guerrilla 
tactics of striking, then retreating to their Jaffna stronghold. Last November 
the government suffered its most serious defeat, losing some 800 soldiers. 
About 450 Tiger insurgents died. 
</P>
<P>
 "The international community should come up with some forum to resolve these 
disputes in a legal and equitable manner," said attorney Rudrakumaran. 
"Otherwise, the fighting is likely to go on."

ASIANS SEE BRIGHT NUCLEAR FUTURE; ECONOMY: DEMAND FOR NEW POWER SOURCES APPEARS 
TO PREVAIL OVER ENVIRONMENTAL WORRIES AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS, WHICH OFTEN 
STALL CONSTRUCTION ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH L. WHITING, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nuclear power plants, increasingly rejected in the West, have a brighter 
future in booming Asian countries with energy shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for continued growth appears to prevail over safety considerations 
and worries of environmentalists, which often stall construction of nuclear 
plants elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think expansion of the economy is a consistent thread with the whole of 
Asia . . . for expanding nuclear power," said Mary Acland-Hood of the Uranium 
Institute, a trade group in London that represents 80 companies in 20 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy demand in the region is expected to increase by 12% annually in the 
1990s compared to 7% in the previous decade, according to the International 
Finance Corp., the private sector arm of the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Many countries -- notably India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand -- will have 
shortages in the next century ranging up to 25% of present supply, said Shehzad 
Shadiq, director of energy and industry for the Asian Development Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 While dozens of nuclear plants are planned for Asia, there is a de facto 
moratorium on new ones in North America, South America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 France is the exception. It gets 75% of its electricity from 56 nuclear power 
stations, and the French expect their technology to play a big role in meeting 
Asia's energy needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan has reopened talks with France on building a second nuclear plant, 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto announced in November. "The nuclear power plant 
shall be the best example of French-Pak friendship," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two countries reached a tentative agreement on the installation in 1990, 
when Bhutto was serving her first term, but the project stalled when she was 
ousted later that year. She was returned to power in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan's first nuclear plant is in Karachi, a southern port city. 
</P>
<P>
 In China, the French nuclear builder Framatome is helping complete two 
900-megawatt reactors at Daya Bay, near Hong Kong, that are scheduled to be 
running in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing recently announced plans to develop a major nuclear power industry by 
2000, including the manufacture and export of 1,200-megawatt generators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nuclear industry and technology are a yardstick for measuring the overall 
strength of a country," said Jiang Xinxiong, head of China National Nuclear 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 He was quoted by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, as saying "a 
network of nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel factories" would provide the 
country with "a pillar for its international standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesian officials say nuclear power is needed, along with other sources of 
electricity, to sustain economic growth. They insist there will be no safety or 
environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend that building reactors on Java, an island known for 
earthquakes and volcanoes, risks disaster. Greenpeace, the international 
environmental group, said Indonesia "could be headed for another Chernobyl." 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion and fire in April, 1986, at the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine 
was the world's worst commercial nuclear accident. President Suharto said at 
the time: "With careful planning we should not have to worry too much about 
such a risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia's first 600-megawatt plant, powered by uranium from Australia, is 
supposed to be operating in 2003. It is to be built near a dormant volcano in 
central Java, 280 miles east of Jakarta. Provisional plans call for 12 plants 
in Indonesia by 2015. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Asia, the picture is mixed. 
</P>

 Japan has 45 plants with a capacity of 35,000 megawatts and plans to increase 
that to 75,000 megawatts. Japan turned to the atom after the oil shock of 1973 
sent prices soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Korea and Taiwan also have expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand is considering a 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant that could help meet 
the increased demand for power by 2006, said Subhin Panyamag of the state-run 
electric utility. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malaysia, said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, "There will be no nuclear 
plant until we have exhausted all other methods to generate electricity." 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia now depends on hydroelectric power, natural gas, fuel oil and coal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippines might convert a $2.2-billion nuclear power station built by 
Westinghouse into a conventional facility, officials said after apparently 
failing to settle a decade-long dispute. The 620-megawatt plant was never 
operated because of safety concerns and allegations that Westinghouse bribed 
the late President Ferdinand Marcos to win the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppliers of nuclear plants see a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Asia-Pacific region has the greatest market potential in the next 
decade," Woodrow Williams of GE Nuclear Energy told a conference in Singapore. 
"We are talking in terms of $160 billion over the next 15 years."

<P>
 The Justice Department has taken over a lawsuit by two whistle blowers 
charging a national distributor of medical equipment with overbilling Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was brought against Curative Technologies Inc. and its former 
subsidiary, UltraMed Inc. of Avoca, Pa., for allegedly fraudulent billing of 
lymphedema pumps to Medicare, the federal old-age health insurance program, 
Assistant Atty. Gen. Frank Hunger said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The pumps are used to treat severe circulatory conditions.

NAVAJOS DECRY MUERTO CANYON HANTAVIRUS SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hantavirus that has killed at least 40 people, including many Navajos, 
should not be named after a canyon on their reservation, the Navajo Nation 
Council says. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 52 to 0 last week to ask the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention not to recommend naming the virus Muerto Canyon Hantavirus. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC proposed the name recently, saying it was following a custom of naming 
diseases after the spot where they were discovered. The agency doesn't 
officially name diseases, but makes recommendations to an international 
scientific body that does. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC officials said the name refers to an obscure spot south of Grants, N.M. 
But Navajo Nation officials say there is no Muerto Canyon in New Mexico, and 
believe the name is a reference to Canyon del Muerto -- or Canyon of Death -- 
located in Canyon de Chelly National Monument on the reservation in northeast 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The illness, which progresses quickly from flu-like symptoms to acute 
breathing difficulty and often death, first appeared last spring in New Mexico 
and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The virus, which is spread in the urine and feces of deer mice, has caused 69 
illnesses, 40 fatal, in 17 states around the country, the CDC said Friday.

IMPORTED WEEDS PLANT NASTY ROOTS IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GREENE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gardeners searching their catalogues for a hardy, tall wildflower might want 
to try the giant hogweed, with its large, maplelike leaves and broad 
umbrella-like clusters of small, white flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that the federal government bans import of the Caucasus native as a 
"noxious weed" worse than poison ivy. The hogweed is already here and, because 
of the way the Agriculture Department views federal law, it won't stop hogweed 
shipments from one state to another. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of loophole could close. Aware of billions of dollars in damage that 
weeds can cause, the department and Congress are working on ways to keep more 
plants out of this country and to restrict the movement of weeds already here. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are long overdue, said Howard M. Singletary Jr., director of the 
plant industry division of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. 
Compared with such undesirable pests as Mediterranean fruit flies and gypsy 
moths, imported weeds have gotten short shrift. 
</P>
<P>
 "They receive less attention because they do not creep, crawl or fly and in 
many cases take longer to establish and begin to proliferate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Weed Science Society of America estimates annual crop losses and 
herbicide costs from non-native weeds at $3.6 billion to $5.4 billion a year, 
Singletary noted in recent testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee. That does not include the impact on natural areas, human health and 
government spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by a report from the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, 
the committee is looking at the threat from thousands of foreign pests, from 
microbial pesticides to zebra mussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeds are an important but neglected component, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weed control programs throughout federal agencies are generally small and 
underfunded," OTA researcher Phyllis Windle told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the technology office, the government has made little use of the 
Federal Noxious Weed Control Act, a 20-year-old law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service took 
eight years to put 93 species on the list, although 750 additional species 
would qualify, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection service has tried to quarantine only one noxious plant, 
witchweed, which has plagued the Carolinas since the 1950s. Because of its 
possible threat to corn, the nation's most important crop, the department has 
worked with North and South Carolina to wipe out the pest. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a quarantine effort under way, the inspection service won't try to 
halt the interstate movement of plants. But quarantines are expensive, 
difficult and sometimes unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
 Those loopholes mean no federal rules will keep a thorny new pest known as the 
tropical soda apple from moving out of Florida, where it is taking over large 
areas of pastureland. The plant could be spread by the dung from cows that are 
able to eat the plants at certain times. A quarantine could hinder the movement 
of cattle outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology office report urged the weed act to restrict native U.S. plants 
that could be pests if taken outside where they normally grow. Pests that 
afflict non-farmland also would be included. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make much sense to be able to work on a weed only in agricultural 
production areas when you go up to the boundary of a parkland and can't do it 
just across the park," said B. Glen Lee, deputy administrator for plant 
protection and quarantine at the inspection service. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, gardeners can still buy purple loosestrife for its long 
spires of closely set small flowers. Tolerant of wet areas and suitable for 
wild settings, the weed has already spread to 37 states. It cost Minnesota 
$500,000 to control between 1987 and 1991. But it hasn't made the federal weed 
list yet.

RIFT TURNS BRAZIL'S ECOLOGY MOVEMENT INTO AN ENDANGERED SPECIES; RAIN FOREST: 
INFIGHTING AND MISMANAGEMENT SPLINTER SOME CONSERVATION GROUPS. WHILE THE 
ONCE-POWERFUL MOVEMENT BREAKS DOWN, THE FORCES OF DESTRUCTION REMAIN STRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years after assassins made rubber tapper Chico Mendes an environmental 
martyr, the movement he led to protect Brazil's rain forest is collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Infighting and mismanagement have splintered some conservation groups. Others 
are losing financial support and members because they have not developed ways 
to use the forest's riches without destroying it. 
</P>
<P>
 An ideological rift has divided domestic environmentalists, who see the Amazon 
as a test region for agrarian reform, and international groups that view 
deforestation in purely ecological terms. 
</P>
<P>
 To the dismay of conservationists, some Indians have even begun illegally 
selling rights to gold and precious hardwoods on their Amazon reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 While the conservation movement breaks down, the forces of destruction remain 
strong: Ranchers, loggers and refugees from Brazil's dry, overpopulated 
northeast continue eating away the 2 million square miles of wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Satellite photos indicate the deforestation rate has declined 63% since 1985, 
largely because Brazil's recession crippled the lumber industry, but a swath of 
jungle twice the size of Delaware still vanished in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prospectors continue to poison hundreds of miles of Amazon tributaries 
with mercury used to isolate gold particles in river dredging. Experts estimate 
that miners dumped 200 tons of mercury into Amazon waters last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The symbolic talk of the '80s hasn't been followed up with concrete, 
practical alternatives," said Rep. Fabio Feldman, the leading environmentalist 
in the Brazilian Congress. "The destruction is only bound to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 A much different future seemed in store five years ago, when Mendes led a 
union of rubber tappers in the sleepy Amazon town of Xapuri in blocking the 
path of bulldozers sent to clear jungle for pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendes also persuaded foreign lenders to scrap loans for ecologically 
destructive projects and lobbied for government-protected "extractivist" 
reserves where people could harvest forest produce without destroying the 
jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 His murder in December, 1988, by a rancher and his son drew world attention to 
the plight of the Amazon and raised preservationist sentiment in Brazil to an 
unprecedented level. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcry led the government to create a 2.4-million-acre reserve in Acre 
state and pledge to set aside another 55 million acres of jungle by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid poured in from the World Wildlife Federation, Ford Foundation and U.S. 
Agency for International Development. Hundreds of local environmental groups 
sprouted almost overnight. The World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank 
suspended financing of controversial road, dam and settlement projects in the 
Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of 40 Indian tribes and hundreds of ecologists gathered at Altamira to 
protest hydroelectric projects that would flood tribal lands. The World Bank 
withdrew financing for the dams. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1990, the rancher and his son were convicted of killing Mendes 
and given 19-year prison sentences. Ecologists saw the convictions as a first 
step toward bringing justice to the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, the government granted the 
primitive Yanomami Indians a jungle reservation the size of Indiana to protect 
them from gold hunters and loggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at the Earth Summit, the movement ran into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian environmentalists accused foreign groups of using the Amazon cause 
for their own profit. The foreigners countered that Brazilian ecologists had 
become too radical in demanding land reform, and halted financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The infighting was pretty depressing," said Anthony Andersen, with the Ford 
Foundation in Rio. "No one was coming up with ideas to help, only 
finger-pointing." 
</P>
<P>
 Then word got out that the Kayapo Indians in Para state were not only mining 
gold and felling huge tracts of endangered mahogany forest on their land, but 
were hiring outsiders to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of Kayapo chiefs squandering money on prostitutes, private planes and 
sports cars while their villages did not have doctors or teachers enraged 
people who had fought for protected Indian reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the union Mendes founded to defend natives of the Amazon who live by 
extracting produce from the rain forest, a feud developed between his 
29-year-old widow, Ilzamar, and his closest aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders accuse Ilzamar Mendes of selling movie rights to Mendes' life 
story without consulting them and of using the money to buy a new home, a 
restaurant, a pickup truck, a satellite dish -- even a cattle ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubber tappers accuse her of mismanaging the Chico Mendes Foundation 
established to promote the rubber tappers' cause. A judge has frozen the 
foundation's assets until lawsuits are settled.

NORTH CAROLINA BLACKS PRAY FOR END TO CRIME; VIOLENCE: OF THOSE CHARGED IN

THE VICTIMS IN HALF OF ALL HOMICIDES.

<P>
 Slightly stooped and dressed all in black, Eddie Byers is out of step with the 
sharply tailored men and women who have tumbled out of their office buildings 
for a sunny lunchtime stroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning arrest of Henry Louis Wallace, a suspect in the serial murders of 
at least 10 young women, already has begun to fade as this city on the verge of 
radiant spring resumes its gentler rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Byers, though, stands very still. Here, smack in the middle of town, he is 
eventually joined by a few other regulars, and together they join hands in a 
brief, quiet vigil against black-on-black crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The brutal truth is that Henry Louis Wallace is only one black man, and the 
young black women he is accused of strangling here are merely additions to an 
already lopsided set of grim statistics mirrored nationwide. Of a record 122 
homicide victims in Charlotte last year, 94 were black. Of those charged with 
violent crimes over roughly the same period, about 70% were black. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take a person like Mr. Wallace and, well, there's so much killing, so 
much crack cocaine going on, he's just another grain of sand on the beach," 
said Byers, who describes himself as being "from the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, every day at noon, they come to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Conrad Pridgeon, pastor at the Greater Bethel AME Church, is absent 
this day. But Robert Walton, a county commissioner, is present. So is Michael 
Justice, a young waiter committed to change. Sometimes, only one or two people 
show up. Sometimes, there are more. 
</P>
<P>
 But never enough, these men say. "It will take so many more to repair what's 
wrong," Walton explained before bowing to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lord, we need healing in this here land," he intoned as people streamed by in 
twos and threes, black and white, snatches of their conversations carried by 
the midday breeze. No one stopped to ask about their prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one ever does," Justice said. "Until something happens, like a Henry 
Wallace. That's when people have questions. After the fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wants to understand what might have driven Wallace, how he could have 
slipped so repeatedly through the justice system's cracks. Might things have 
been different if he'd gotten help? Did the police and media pay enough 
attention when the bodies of young black women began turning up? 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone wants to know, it seems, for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it's back to business as usual," Justice said, "people out here dying 
all the time. And no one getting to the issues. Henry Wallace isn't the issue. 
He's just easy to identify." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of life has been called epidemic. President Clinton has prevailed on 
black leaders to take back their streets; the Rev. Jesse Jackson has launched a 
similar crusade, despairing at the relief he's come to feel when the footsteps 
behind him on a city street belong to someone white. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real point is that black people not just here but in communities all over 
the country are dying, in all kinds of ways, every day," said Sandifer 
McCullough, finishing up a fast-food breakfast at the Bojangles where four of 
the strangled women worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reality is that I'm considered an old man in my community because I'm 
nearly 30 and I'm not rotting in jail and don't have a bullet through my head," 
said McCullough, who counsels juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reality is that sometimes I might just be walking to a Bible study class, 
and the police will stop me because I'm a black man. . . . My reality is that 
they don't show guys like me in the news. They show our young men wearing hoods 
and handcuffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Violence is pervasive, and the sense of it has pushed crime to the top of 
white agendas. But clearly the danger is skewed: Blacks, who make up about 12% 
of the population, were the victims in 50 of every 100 homicides committed 
nationwide in 1992, according to federal statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 In this context, the accusations against Henry Louis Wallace are nearly 
dwarfed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to think about, but we as citizens need to think about it that way 
if we're ever really going to do anything about it," said Harper Wilson, a 
special agent with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 But the daily death toll mostly goes on in silence, newsworthy not so much for 
its extraordinary upward spiral as for the chilling ordinariness of it all. 
Disproportionate arrest and murder rates, unemployment, drug abuse, poverty and 
racism are complex and difficult to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the media focus on the exceptions, the glamorous, the macabre, the 
bizarre, the unique," said Dr. Carl Bell, a Chicago psychiatrist known for his 
work on race issues. "It's simple-minded, stereotypical, misleading, distorted 
and . . . certainly isn't helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of many members of Charlotte's black community, the Henry Louis 
Wallace case has underscored these omissions and failures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to think of prejudice, but it's hard," said Shonda Wallace, 26, a 
college graduate who for now can find work only as an overnight hotel clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain people who just write us all off, who think, 'Well, that's 
just their way of life,' " said Wallace, a New Jersey native who is not related 
to the murder suspect. "You know, a guy had his throat slashed the night before 
last, right in the center of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's OK. That's just a drug thing, right?"

NO OWL, BUT PUSSY CAT WENT TO SEA IN CHILL BOAT

<P>
 The cargo container that arrived from Taiwan had one import too many. 
</P>
<P>
 A scrawny, blue-eyed cat traveled about 6,000 miles and spent more than three 
weeks at sea in a chilly corner of a container shipped to a Mt.Vernon 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The black cat was christened Hanjin for the name of the Korean shipping line 
painted in huge white letters on the container's side. The cat was found last 
month by Steve Wells, who owns Mobile Merchandisers Inc., when he opened the 
steel box to unload a shipment of display stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, it was up there staring at me," Wells said. "I said, 'What 
do we have here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wells fed the frightened animal a bit of dried doughnut and water. He closed 
up the container and returned the next day with cat food. Hanjin grabbed a few 
bites, then stole farther back into the container. Warehouse manager Bob 
Stickle carefully emptied the container, box by box, to expose the cat's hiding 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarian Gary Johnson, wearing thick welder's gloves, carefully plucked 
the cat from its nest of shredded cardboard at the container's far end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a baby, aren't you?" Johnson said, cradling it in his arms. He took the 
cat to his Highland Animal Clinic, where it was given food, water and a hot pad 
to sleep on. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing OK so far," said Mary Emmett, a veterinary technician. "I'm 
surprised she's doing so well. Poor little thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells' wife, Darcy, who owns and operates an adjoining import wholesale 
company, said she may keep Hanjin as an official warehouse cat.

FRIENDS, FOES HAVE ONLY KIND WORDS

<P>
 Former President Nixon was remembered Friday with kind words from old friends 
and foes alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Past differences are now history. I wish him God's care and peace," said 
Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker, who as a Republican member of the Senate 
Watergate Committee often took sides against the GOP President. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Ronald Reagan said: "Today the world mourns the loss of a 
great champion of democratic ideals who dedicated his life to the cause of 
world peace. For millions, Richard Nixon was truly one of the finest statesman 
this world has ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was deeply grateful to President Nixon for his wise counsel on many 
occasions" over the past year, President Clinton said from the Rose Garden. "He 
went out of his way to give me his best advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Michigan Gov. George Romney, who campaigned against Nixon in the 1968 
GOP nomination contest, then served as Nixon's secretary of health, education 
and welfare, called Nixon "the ablest man to hold the presidency since World 
War II." 
</P>
<P>
 And former Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), who was ranking minority member of the 
Senate Watergate Committee, said: "His contribution to the ending years of the 
Cold War and the pursuit of peace will be recognized and remarked on for 
generations to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I admire most his strength of character that permitted him to recover 
from his resignation from the presidency and to become a respected senior 
statesman," Baker said. "That was truly remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) was one of many people who said Nixon's other 
achievements would eventually outshine the Watergate scandal that clouded his 
image during his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "All in all, people are going to look back and say Watergate, the resignation, 
a lot of these things were bad and shouldn't have happened," Dole said. "I 
think history will, with a few exceptions, say that this man made a difference. 
You add all that up and he comes out ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Butz, agriculture secretary under Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, remembered 
Nixon as a man who prized loyalty and returned it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these days when Watergate becomes a footnote in history . . . and 
when the Nixon haters in the press are all gone . . . Richard Nixon will go 
down as one of the great presidents in history," said Butz, dean emeritus of 
agriculture at Purdue University in Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Agnew, wife of Nixon's vice president Spiro T. Agnew, expressed sympathy 
for Nixon's family but said her husband had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Albert (D-Okla.), who was U.S. House speaker during Nixon's presidency, 
had these thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
 "He was sort of weird but to me he was a friendly sort of person," Albert said 
from McAlester, Okla. "I never had any trouble with him."

RUSSIAN IMMIGRANTS FIND JOBS IN ISRAEL SCARCE; MIDEAST: MANY OF THE 
HALF-MILLION WHO ARRIVED SINCE 1989 HAVE TROUBLE FITTING IN, MOST NOTABLY 
PROFESSIONALS IN A NATION ALREADY OVERFLOWING WITH DOCTORS, LAWYERS AND 
ENGINEERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Olga Gutman, a physician for more than 10 years, is too embarrassed to tell 
friends back in Russia that the only work she can find in Israel is scrubbing 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have peers who say they would rather go hungry, but when you have no 
choice, that's what you do," said Gutman, a native of Chelyabinsk who is 39 and 
has two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 13-year-old daughter Genya has trouble adjusting at school. Israeli 
classmates used to laugh at her, and now just call her a snob because she reads 
so much Pushkin poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 475,580 Russians who came to Israel since 1989 have trouble 
fitting in, most notably professionals who find themselves in a nation of only 
5.3 million already overflowing with doctors, lawyers and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen percent of immigrants from the former Soviet Union are unemployed, 
about double the national average. Only one-third work in their chosen fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel still has not figured out what to do with all the 130,000 immigrant 
doctors, scientists, engineers and teachers, who have doubled the numbers in 
those professions. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant violinists play on the street, leaving their cases open as 
collection boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other new arrivals are more fortunate. Immigrant musicians, athletes, 
actors and dancers grace the arts. A Russian represented Israel at the Miss 
Universe contest and Michael Shmerkin, a champion skater from Ukraine, competed 
for Israel at the winter Olympics in Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin noted in a speech that Israel had no work for the 
3,500 immigrant Russian miners. "We do have many mine fields here," he said, 
"but not a single mine." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the newcomers, finding a place in the new society is as hard as 
finding work. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a study by the Jewish Agency, a quasi-official body that handles 
immigration, 77% of immigrants since 1992 have had little or no social contact 
with native Israelis. Only 8% of those questioned said they felt a sense of 
belonging to Israeli society. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Israelis, envious of tax breaks and other benefits given immigrants, 
often are more hindrance than help. They make Russians the butt of jokes and 
blame them for everything from bad driving to increasing alcoholism and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to adapt, many newcomers retreat into their own subculture. 
There are Russian bars, cafes, libraries and theater groups. Several dozen 
Russian-language newspapers and magazines have sprung up. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Sorkin, 45, who came to Israel four years ago, takes her 7-year-old son, 
Benjamin, to a Russian-language theater club every week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer a Russian teacher," she said. "They don't let the kids just have 
fun. They teach them something." 
</P>
<P>
 She rarely mingles with Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like falafel and they don't like ballet," she said. "That's the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Falafel, fried balls of chick-pea paste, are a national dish in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the adjustment problems appears to be a factor in the decline of 
immigration from Russia, which fell to 65,700 last year from nearly 200,000 in 
1990, 
</P>
<P>
 "Russian Jews are stuck between the hammer and the anvil," said Yuli 
Kashorovsky, who was jailed for Jewish activism in the Soviet Union and came to 
Israel in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews are anxious to leave the uncertainty of Russia, he said, "but not 
enthusiastic about joining a custodial labor force in Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 600,000 Russian Jews have exit visas, but many are waiting. 
Israeli officials predict half will come by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The 800,000 Israelis of Russian origin already here have become the largest 
immigrant group and a significant political force. Many accuse Rabin of 
neglecting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some immigrant leaders have threatened to vote Rabin's Labor Party out of 
office in the next elections, scheduled for 1996, unless he comes up with more 
jobs. In 1992, the Russian vote was an important part of Labor's victory over 
the right-wing Likud bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kashorovsky put it: "The government has to understand that it isn't enough 
to talk a good game and then come to immigrants for votes. . . . What we are 
looking for is results, jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet political prisoner who leads the 
Russian-immigrant lobby, said in an open letter to Rabin that "not enough has 
been done to solve the problems faced by the new immigrants, especially those 
of employment and underemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 Yair Tsaban, the immigrant absorption minister, said in an interview that 
Israeli is "probably the only country in the world that not only doesn't object 
to the immigrant flood, we invite the flood. We want as many as possible to 
arrive." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he feels more could be done, Tsaban said, the Russians are getting 
more help than their predecessors. He noted that government-backed mortgages 
had enabled half the families to buy apartments, an unprecedented figure among 
immigrants.

RETIREE BUILDS FUTURE FROM HOBBY WITH ERECTOR SETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY McSHANE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lou Boselli is a kid at heart -- and at work. Boselli, 53, is Peter Pan with a 
pair of tiny wrenches. Two years after taking early retirement from his job at 
West Point, he travels the country making new-fangled creations from an 
old-fashioned toy: the Erector set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about dying and going to heaven -- I'm in heaven, and I didn't have to 
die," Boselli said, standing amid his models and a Christmas crowd in FAO 
Schwarz. "Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to be called in as an Erector 
consultant." 
</P>
<P>
 Those dreams started at age 9, when Boselli received his first Erector set 
from his parents. His first creation was a Ferris wheel, and he was hooked for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 His newer works are on a much larger scale: A 40-foot Eiffel Tower displayed 
at the Wollman Rink, an eight-foot Empire State Building complete with stuffed 
King Kong. It took him two weeks working with the small metal parts to finish 
that project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mechanically inclined," he recalled. "I think my parents saw that, and 
they decided I should try my hand at an Erector set. They were right -- I made 
a career out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, a second career. Boselli worked as a tool and die maker for three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 At West Point, he designed special teaching tools for cadets: Scale models of 
weapons and tanks, special engines, gun mounts and anything else the nation's 
military minds conjured up. 
</P>
<P>
 When called on to create bridge models, Boselli turned to his hobby for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, Boselli's obsessions grew. He began collecting old Erector sets, 
visiting church sales and flea markets, and eventually assembling 30 different 
sets dating to 1915. He joined a club with other enthusiasts. He began visiting 
toy fairs to display his vintage sets and his creations. 
</P>
<P>
 At a 1987 toy fair, Boselli met an Erector official and eventually received a 
part-time job. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Boselli took early retirement and officially became the company's 
"Erector Master." In addition to the fun he has at work, Boselli delights in 
telling disbelieving folks what he does for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell 'em, 'I build models with Erector sets.' They say, 'Yeah, 20 or 30 
years ago. What are you doing now?' " Boselli said, laughing. "And I patiently 
explain the whole thing."

SCIENTIST-DETECTIVE FEELS FOR MURDER CLUES IN BONES, OLD OR NEW; FORENSICS: 
DOUGLAS W. OWSLEY IS A SKELETAL BIOLOGIST WITH TRAINING IN ARCHEOLOGY. HE HELPS 
POLICE FIND AND DECIPHER FRESHER REMAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a perfect place to bury a body. 
</P>
<P>
 The grounds of the high-rise apartment building were overgrown with brush. 
Anyone on an unsavory midnight errand easily would have gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, this was where an informant had told police they could find the body 
of a young woman who had disappeared eight months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the experienced eye of the Smithsonian Institution's Douglas W. Owsley, 
it was evident the body wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of work with soils and looking for disturbed features," said 
Owsley, one of only about 60 trained forensic anthropologists in the United 
States. "You'll see a depression or maybe cracking in the soil, or you'll see 
lower subsoils that have been disturbed, brought out, mixed with topsoil." 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting discoloration, said the 42-year-old scientist, is a dead 
giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most others in his unusual field, Owsley is a skeletal biologist with 
training in archeology. His experience recovering and studying ancient bones 
enables him to help law enforcement agencies find and identify fresher remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Owsley lives two very different lives. In one he is a serious scholar, 
specializing in the remains of prehistoric Great Plains Indians. He publishes 
research papers on such esoteric subjects as the duration of breast-feeding 
among American Indian hunter-gatherers and maize-growers. 
</P>
<P>
 In his other life, he's a gumshoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any given jurisdiction, law enforcement agencies are inevitably going to 
face badly decomposed remains or a skeleton, but only irregularly," said 
Owsley. "A detective may see one case in three years. So they are not totally 
prepared to systematically excavate the remains." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago Owsley found and identified what was left of Milwaukee mass 
murderer Jeffrey Dahmer's first victim. It was one of Owsley's more challenging 
assignments because the victim had been dismembered and the bones crushed and 
spread over two acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Another challenge was identifying the cremated remains of two American 
journalists killed by a local civil patrol in Guatemala. All that was left were 
three small, charred bone fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bones are like books," Owsley said. "Most people are not aware of the wealth 
of information you can reconstruct from them. They tell you a lot about that 
person and what happened to the individual. You find out how old the person is, 
what sex and race, how tall, how robust, their activity patterns in life." 
</P>
<P>
 This spring Owsley will testify in the case of the young Washington woman. 
Police were certain she had been murdered, but without a body, their prime 
suspect could not be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, the police asked Owsley to examine the rear of the building 
where the woman had gone apartment-hunting before she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 After Owsley ruled out the area as a possible burial site, more information 
from the informant -- and a re-enactment of what police believed happened -- 
led to the building's furnace room. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a large retaining wall," Owsley recalled. "I crawled up there and 
got back into a sand-packed area. I noticed a depression and a subtle mound in 
the sand. That's where she was." 
</P>
<P>
 On a more typical day, Owsley works behind a gray steel desk in a cramped, 
cluttered space in the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History. His office is 
lined with plaques from various police agencies, including the FBI, commending 
him for helping solve crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hall are hundreds of boxes containing ancient bones from sites 
throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the bones are those of American Indians. One skull, its front caved in 
by a war club, belonged to a member of Gen. George A. Custer's unlucky party at 
the Battle of Little Bighorn. 
</P>
<P>
 In his office, Owsley held up a newer skull, another artifact from a criminal 
case in Washington, with numerous holes in it, each about the size of a 
half-dollar. "The weapon here was a hammer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another case Owsley helped solve involved a woman who had been killed with a 
shotgun and dumped in the Mississippi River. Police found a bone fragment in 
the suspect's pickup truck. The suspect claimed it was from a deer. Owsley 
proved otherwise, and today the man and an accomplice are serving time. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong stomach is required in Owsley's line of work. He employs what he 
calls "selective numbing" to cope with the physical and sometimes emotional 
effects of dealing with murderers and the murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that helps is the fact that you do help the families," he said. 
"You're often able to provide information, and they're often desperate to know 
what happened to their loved one. By helping in identifying that person and 
shedding light on what happened, you may prevent it from happening to someone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Owsley had intended to become a physician. A University of Wyoming 
archeological field trip to Mexico, in which he helped recover remains of 
pre-Columbian Aztecs, altered his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 He became an enthusiastic student of skeletons. Occasionally, when he was 
dating his future wife, he boiled the head of a road-killed bobcat on her 
apartment stove, an accepted method of stripping a skull for study. Shortly 
after the wedding, he said, "she cut that out." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to prehistoric Plains Indians, Owsley's work has taken him into 
the 17th Century, the dark ages of colonial America. Few written records 
survive from that harrowing period when English settlers in such places as 
Jamestown, Va., and St. Marys City, Md., struggled for a foothold on a new, 
often hostile, continent. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bones tell Owsley much of their story.

NEW ENGLAND MUD SEASON SLIPS, SLIDES IN; THAW: RESIDENTS FACE MIRE THAT COMES 
BETWEEN WINTER AND SPRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across the northern half of New England, from Vermont's Lake Champlain to 
Maine's potato country, it's just about time for the next season of the year -- 
the one called Mud Season. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fabled foliage of fall, after all the snow and ice of winter, after 
months and months of long nights and short days, after all the boots, hats, 
mittens and long johns and the frozen water pipes, after what turned out this 
year to be record colds and record snows -- after all that, just when the rest 
of the world is snipping forsythia and planting tomatoes, along comes Mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Up here, that doesn't mean just a little bit of soggy topsoil. Mud Season 
means real mud -- the kind of boot-sucking, ax-grabbing, carpet-wrecking, 
super-saturated muck that just gobbles up two-wheel-drive imports driven by 
flatlanders from Boston or New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mud Season is a notation of Nature, not of the calendar," wrote farmer and 
essayist Richard M. Ketchum in his book "Second Cuttings: Letters from the 
Country," "and describes an interval of indeterminate duration between winter 
and spring. It has none of spring's fripperies or fall's harlot colors, none of 
winter's white mantle or summer's lushness. The going is sloppy and slow, the 
ground underfoot soggy and treacherous." 
</P>
<P>
 Mud Season seems to hold its tightest grip on Vermont, which is a world of 
steep hills and dirt roads where traction is next to godliness this month. In 
early April, just getting the mail can be an adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 The science of mud is pretty straightforward. The ground freezes during the 
cold New England winter anywhere from two to four or more feet down. The depth 
of the freeze depends largely on the lateness of the winter's first snow, since 
snow insulates the soil. The later the first snow, the deeper the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 When warmer weather finally returns, the ground slowly thaws out from the top 
down. The bottom layer of frozen soil acts like a giant saucer, trapping any 
moisture above it. 
</P>
<P>
 Up on the surface, meanwhile, three to six feet of snow is melting and spring 
rains are pounding down. Combined, they produce a tremendous amount of water 
with nowhere to go. When it mixes with New England's fine-grained soil, the 
result is serious mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five seasons of the year, Mud must be the ugliest. In addition to all 
the muck and stains, the melting snow of Mud Season reveals all of the winter's 
animal droppings (now rapidly warming) and whatever other detritus has lain 
buried and frozen in snow all winter. 
</P>
<P>
 So far at least, Mud has proven immune to cute. There are no "Mud Festivals," 
no Mud queens or mud-slinging contests or even mud-pies. Mud is earnest, dark 
and deep. 
</P>
<P>
 It does have its own not-so-dry humor. Dick Sweterlitsch, a folklorist at the 
University of Vermont, collects mud jokes like this one: 
</P>
<P>
 "Two farmers are sitting on a front porch looking out at a muddy road. All of 
a sudden they see a hat belonging to another neighbor, Frank, come sliding down 
the road. They go to investigate and lift the hat from the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure enough, there's Frank underneath, moving steadily through the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'No problem,' said Frank, 'I'm on my horse!' " 
</P>
<P>
 One Vermonter who knows his mud is Frank Bryan. A political scientist at the 
University of Vermont in Burlington, resident of a dirt road and co-author of 
"Real Vermonters Don't Milk Goats," Bryan said the biggest danger is "bottoming 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the term for what happens when a motor vehicle -- usually a 
rear-wheel-drive sedan -- meets more mud than it can handle. Bottoming out can 
be a big problem in a state that is mostly uphill and down and mostly dirt 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get in so much mud that you are sitting on the axles. There is no bottom. 
You are just floating," Bryan explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "To drive through mud, the key is you've got to battle your instincts. You've 
got to drive like hell. You've got to stay in low gear and just floor the 
son-of-a-bitch. It's just the opposite of driving in snow. A lot of flatlanders 
don't have the guts for it," Bryan said in a recent interview in which he 
unsuccessfully tried to stifle a chortle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit like driving on train tracks. There's a rut where somebody else 
has gone through the mud. You try to stay in the ruts. Sometimes, the rear 
wheels get in one rut and the front get in another and you kind of go 
sideways." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, a lot of things besides cars come a halt during Mud. Many 
towns forbid hauling logs by truck because the weight wrecks roads when they 
are muddy. Loggers often have to stop cutting trees, because mills will not 
accept mud-covered timber; it gums up their saws. 
</P>
<P>
 But it can be a busy time of year nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Not by accident, this is the time of year when New England villages hold their 
annual "town meetings." Long ago, the old-time Yankees decided to jam all their 
government and politics into one day-long binge, timed to take place just 
before the roads became impassable with mud. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also maple sugar time. When the nights are cold and the days are warm, 
sap rises in the giant maple trees, and New Englanders tap the trees to gather 
the sap. The sap is collected and boiled to make the maple syrup for a hungry 
nation's pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's the time of year when sheep drop their new lambs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan described what happened one night when he and his wife tried to make it 
home up Big Hollow Road in Starksboro: 
</P>
<P>
 "We bottomed out. So what I did was get out and put the jack under the back 
bumper. Instead of the car going up, the jack disappears, down into the mud. If 
you're lucky enough to hit something hard, you jack it up a few inches, then 
run around to the other side and push the car off the jack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, it's cold . . . and you've got your good shoes on. Your wife holds 
the flashlight, and you fish around underneath the bumper for the jack. Then 
you run around to the front and repeat the process. You are literally trying to 
walk the car across the road, looking for a rut you can use." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Winchester, who works the tow truck at Rod's Mobil in Putney, says he 
gets as many as four calls a day at the height of mud season, especially on 
weekends when tourists are likely to be on the roads. But natives bottom out 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more guys that get stuck, because they think they can make it," he 
notes. Once, even his wrecker got stuck and needed a tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the old ways are best. Bryan says that when all else fails, he 
hitches up the oxen. Nothing has stopped them yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hopeful time of year," Bryan adds. "Because if Mud Season comes, can 
spring be far behind? Vermonters can sense spring the way mariners can sense 
land."

HANS BURKHARDT; LEADING PROTEST ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hans Burkhardt, the much-honored Swiss-born artist whose protest paintings 
grew from the Dickensian squalor of his youth, died Friday. Burkhardt, whose 
subjects ranged from the divisiveness of the Spanish Civil War, the millions of 
dead in World War II and the horror of My Lai in Vietnam to the recent 
campaigns of Desert Storm, died at his home in Los Angeles, said Jack Rutberg, 
his agent and biographer. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by Times art critic William Wilson "a classic American-immigrant 
success story," Burkhardt spent his boyhood hungry and cold in a Basel city 
orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, he wearied of the poverty and took his innate artistic talent to New 
York, where he came under the influence of abstract expressionist Arshile 
Gorky. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the opportunity to express himself as he wished, Burkhardt told The 
Times in 1992 -- just before being honored with a lifetime achievement award 
from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters -- he was amazed 
that "in the U.S., you have a decent meal every day." 
</P>
<P>
 He studied and lived with Gorky and associated with Willem de Kooning. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorky committed suicide in 1948, a decade after Burkhardt had moved to Los 
Angeles, where he lost what little he had in a divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Afterward, I hung the clerk of the Domestic Relations Court in a painting. It 
was my first protest painting." 
</P>
<P>
 That set him on a path that was to make him a leader in socially conscious 
art. Conversely, however, his other works portrayed optimism and hope in a 
dichotomy that Burkhardt said reflected his own divisive feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 His oils and pastels were featured in Art News and Artspace magazines. He had 
his work shown at prestigious exhibits in Mexico and was included in the 1955 
U.S. presentation at the 3rd Biennial of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also had such controversial works as "Red Christ" barred from jury 
consideration at the Los Angeles County Museum; a protester used a cane to 
strike Burkhardt's "War, Agony and Death," which was also slashed twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson noted that in the same year Burkhardt won the county museum's annual 
juried show prize for his painting "One Way Out," the museum "inexplicably 
refused to show" the work. 
</P>
<P>
 His protest art first came to light with such works as "Concentration Camp" 
and "The Death of Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, he joined a widespread film studio strike and from that painted 
"Studio Scab -- Ronald Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward he moved to Mexico for several years, and later said 
although "I love this country," (the United States) Mexico is "where life and 
death live close together and people aren't afraid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to this country in the late 1950s, Burkhardt taught at Cal State 
Long Beach, UCLA, USC and the Otis and Chouinard institutes and others. 
</P>
<P>
 He painted tributes to such fallen leaders as John and Robert Kennedy, Martin 
Luther King Jr. and the students at Kent State University who died protesting 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 A retrospective of his work is on exhibit at the Jack Rutberg gallery on North 
La Brea Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkhardt is survived by a daughter.

NURSES DEAL WITH DISPUTE, WARD REALITY; MEDICAL: THEY WORRY THAT SHORT STAFFING 
AT THE COUNTY HOSPITAL MAY LEAD TO TRAGEDY, AND THAT A NEW CONTRACT GIVES THEM 
NO POWER TO STOP IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The morning sky is still gray when three nurses gather in a tiny corneroffice 
at the Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a call from a patient who has been frequently seen in ER (emergency 
room)," night shift supervisor Meliba Ocibillo informs her relief at 6:45 a.m. 
"He has threatened to come over and shoot us." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not all: Nine women are in labor, an overflow ward has been opened on 
the third floor, and the thermometers on 3 West ward are reading high. 
</P>
<P>
 A glance at a computer printout shows nurse supervisor Darla Lowery that the 
obstetrics ward might need more nurses, but the surgery units are overstaffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, a beeper strapped to her black sweat pants, sets off on her rounds, 
ready to see what the day shift holds. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the rhetoric of the nurses' bitter dispute with the county lies the 
reality of the county hospital, where administrators scramble to get the nurses 
they need and send home the ones they don't. And where nurses worry that short 
staffing will one day lead to tragedy, and that terms of a new contract imposed 
on them give them no power to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, what Ventura County is experiencing is the paradox of health-care 
reform. The movement, on one hand, offers nurses more responsibility and 
respect by turning over many doctors' tasks to highly trained nurses. At the 
same time, the cost-cutting initiatives have led to layoffs and pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the dispute has taken on nasty overtones. After a 
frustrating year of layoffs, slashed salaries and stalled contract 
negotiations, the nurses threatened to strike. The county responded by forcing 
them to accept a pay and benefits package that they had already rejected at the 
negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of nurses are feeling that their rights are not being 
respected," says Maria Lafitte, a senior registered nurse at the hospital. 
"Sometimes we have to stand up for our rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrators say they mean no disrespect. Instead, they say they 
need the new compensation package -- and the latitude it provides in sending 
nurses home when the wards are empty -- in order to survive financial cuts. "I 
need some flexibility," said Darlene Betker, director of nursing at the 
hospital. "If I don't have flexibility. I will have to have layoffs. I don't 
want layoffs. Layoffs are horrible. But I can't have people here picking up 
salaries when there is no work."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Betker moves quickly down the third-floor corridor, speaking to the nurses 
gathered at their stations. She walked these floors as a nurse for most of her 
45-year career. Now she does the rounds each morning to check on her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall from her office, she finds nurses huddled around a 
tape-recorder, jotting down comments that the night shift left on each patient 
in the ward. Around the corner, nurses ready a handful of patients for surgery. 
Upstairs, the neonatal unit prepares a seriously ill, premature baby for 
transfer to UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Betker stops by the emergency room to check on the threat they received 
earlier. As it turns out, the call came from a mentally ill patient the nurses 
knew. They dispatched paramedics and police to pick him up and lock him into 
the county's psychiatric in-patient unit. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 in the morning, the emergency room is virtually empty. The surgery 
units upstairs are also quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, the state had refused to authorize any elective surgery for 
poor patients, explains James Holden, the doctor who runs the general surgery 
unit. Elective surgery doesn't mean face-lifts and nose jobs. It means gall 
bladder operations, slipped discs and other surgery that Ventura County's poor 
residents need. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, Medi-Cal's position is that if you aren't dying from it, it's not 
an emergency," Holden says. The state has started to approve operations again, 
but the hospital for now is still using only two of its three operating rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 That means excess nurses on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden supports one of the most contentious elements of the county's 
compensation package for nurses: sending nurses home when they're not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to send people home," he said. "And I personally don't want to 
see the nurses' pay cut. But we need to do something." Nurses say they do not 
object to the idea, just the policy as written by the county. The California 
Nurses Assn. argued for a "comp-time bank" that would allow nurses to save 
excess hours and be paid for them on days when they were sent home, said Helen 
Horn, an assistant director with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn said the nurses also want limits on the policy, which allows the hospital 
to dismiss nurses when they are "not immediately necessary." That term should 
be defined more precisely, she contended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they say that," Betker responded. "That's what I'm paid to do is to 
make those kind of judgments. When I send somebody home, I've got to make sure 
that I am not putting any patient at risk, that I'm covered." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darla Lowery's beeper sounds at 10:45 a.m., and the day shift nursing 
supervisor heads toward the obstetrics ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to need to call in another nurse if that's OK with you, Darla," 
obstetrics nurse Sharon Madonna says breathlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Two women have delivered their babies. Another seven are still in labor. Six 
women are in recovery and three others are hospitalized in an attempt to stop 
premature labor. Six nurses are handling the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too much," Madonna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery authorizes another nurse, as the unmistakable wail of a woman in labor 
rises from a room nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the talk about laying off and sending home nurses, administrators 
still find themselves scrambling for nurses in some units. Obstetrics 
fluctuates daily, if not hourly. Other critical-care units, including intensive 
care and telemetry, are chronically understaffed, nurses say. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the weekends, they're down to such a skeleton crew that one sick call can 
throw the whole place," said intensive care nurse Sheila Raives, who serves on 
the union's negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses say staff reductions and cost-cutting measures can threaten lives in 
these units. 
</P>
<P>
 On some occasions, administrators have floated nurses who lack adequate 
training into intensive care or telemetry, both of which require monitoring 
complex machines, Raives said. In one instance, a nurse made a medication error 
that did not harm the patient but alarmed other nurses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses contend that when staffing is short in the critical-care units, the 
nursing supervisors downgrade the level of care required by changing their 
assessment of a patient's condition, or acuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Betker vehemently denies any such activity. "The whole acuity system is based 
on the registered nurse's direct assessment of the patient," Betker said. "I 
don't do the assessment. No one in the nursing office does the assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 She also denies any unsafe staffing practices, pointing out that the state and 
hospital set specific requirements for critical-care units.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the California Nurses Assn. submitted about three dozen 
complaints to state health licensing officials, charging that nurses had been 
assigned in ways that could threaten patient safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health Services Licensing and Certification confirms that 
investigators looked into complaints, but cannot release results until the 
investigation is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Betker said the state brought four investigators to review her records in 
January, and adds: "I want to tell you, there wasn't a shred of proof." 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, Betker clashed with the intensive care nurses over providing a 
lunch hour. The nurses, who then worked from 6:45 a.m. to 3:15 p.m., wanted 30 
minutes off in the middle of the day but needed qualified workers to relieve 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a bagful of ICU nurses that I can just plug in there 
willy-nilly," Betker said. 
</P>
<P>
 So she did away with the lunch break and changed the shift hours to 7 a.m. to 
3 p.m. "Lunch relief is by operational availability," Betker said, recalling 
eating at her post during her 12 years as a critical-care nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse Practitioner Brenda Robinette rushes down the hall with a minutes-old 
baby boy who is breathing too fast and grunting. Respiratory difficulty, she 
tells the nurses as she brings the infant into the neonatal intensive-care unit 
at about 11:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse Specialist Debbie Lao places baby Gabriel in an Isolette and attaches 
monitors to his tiny chest. She swabs his wrist with a cotton square as big as 
his hand, and then tries to draw the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Gabriel screams at the touch of the needle, his cheeks growing pinker 
and healthier with each wail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Happy Birthday," Robinette coos into the Isolette. "Welcome to ICU."  
</P>
<P>
 As a nurse practitioner, Robinette is trained to evaluate the baby, prescribe 
certain medications and perform a set of procedures without a doctor's 
permission. Lao, as a nurse specialist, also has special expertise in dealing 
with sick babies. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his health care reforms, President Clinton is looking for such 
highly trained nurses to deliver many of the services now provided by doctors. 
Already, Ventura County uses nurse practitioners to run many of its public 
health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nurses are really a key part of health-care restructuring," said Judith 
Overmyer, co-chairwoman of the local nurses' union. "You're going to be hearing 
a lot more from nurses." 
</P>
<P>
 So nurses found it frustrating when contract negotiations dissolved into a 
debate on pay cuts and layoffs, Overmyer said. "We had all these big ideas that 
we wanted to talk about, and we got down and dirty from the start," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, nurses fear that the new compensation plan will give 
administrators latitude to fire senior nurses. The plan provides for layoffs by 
unit, rather than by seniority. Betker said nurses will still retain their 
seniority rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Betker said she also was disappointed with the negotiations, the first she has 
participated in during her long career. But she said the financial changes were 
an economic necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may make people feel better to represent me with two horns and a tail, but 
the fact is I have to survive; we have to survive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By 3 p.m., Betker and Darla Lowery are back in the tiny third-floor office, 
this time briefing nurse supervisor Denise Stewart on the shift ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses have shut down the overflow ward on the third floor but are still 
seeking a bed for one patient. Baby Gabriel is breathing well in neonatal 
intensive care and could soon be moved to the regular nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 Two babies have been born during the day shift, but two more expectant mothers 
arrived, bringing the total back to nine women in labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Vonnie Haller, clinical manager for the obstetrics unit, rushes into the room 
and asks for more nurses. "There's five on the schedule tonight," she said. "I 
can't do it with five." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart agrees to find someone, and starts the new shift looking for a nurse.

TEMPERATURE PUTS CHILL ON BEACH PARTY; VENTURA: ORGANIZERS SAID THOUSANDS 
SHOWED UP FOR START OF TWO-DAY FESTIVAL DESPITE COOL WEATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura's California Beach Party has always been blessed with blue skies and 
warm weather -- until Saturday, when a chilly breeze from an approaching 
Pacific storm forced bikini-clad models and spectators in their Bermuda shorts 
to take cover from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong winds and scattered showers were expected for today, forecasters said, 
the last day of the weekend event. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Saturday's sometimes dreary weather, organizers said thousands of 
beach-goers showed up to kick off the festival. Last year's party drew more 
than 25,600 during the weekend and the city hopes to top that this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which is in its ninth year, is Ventura's biggest special event 
and a two-day celebration of the early days of surfing and 1950s beach culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to be wearing shorts and tank tops," said Simi Valley 
resident Criona Bowman. At least, she added: "it's not raining." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman and her two daughters, Lindsay and Melinda, were among about 500 
Ventura County residents who rode the first of three Metrolink trains to the 
beach party Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first year Metrolink has been available for transportation to the 
beach party. The train runs originate in Simi Valley and stop in Moorpark, 
Camarillo and Oxnard before the final stop at the county fairgrounds in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be thrilled if we get 1,500 (train passengers) for both days, 
particularly in light of the weather," said Debbie Solomon, city supervisor of 
community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura resident Reese Martin chose a flashier mode of transportation, 
cruising to the event in his 1955 Porsche Spyder. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin entered the gray convertible sports car in the classic-car show. 
Although it is not an original model but a "kit car," the faux-Spyder was a 
magnet for car admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 "By car-show standards, it's filthy," Martin said, pointing to his dusty hot 
rod and the long line of polished vehicles near it. "These people who are 
serious don't drive their cars. You can't, they're too valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the car show, the party includes a volleyball tournament, 
body-building championship and numerous bands and performers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the swimsuit fashion show, a team of shivering, bikini-clad women hurriedly 
walked across a temporary stage on the Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were telling me, 'You walked too fast,' " said 16-year-old swimsuit 
model Marcy Collins. "I was cold!" 
</P>
<P>
 The chilly temperature, which hovered near 60 along the coast, ruined business 
for Vicki Parker, whose shaved-ice drinks were not in high demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping they'll pick up here real soon," she said. "We're optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 The beach party was started in 1984 during the Summer Olympics to show 
foreigners a slice of Southern California life as popularized in the 
beach-blanket movies of the 1950s and '60s.  
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipated great hordes of foreign visitors," said Faye Campbell, the 
city's special events coordinator. But of the 1,000 people who attended that 
year, only about 10 were from other countries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After putting the event on hiatus for awhile, city leaders decided to give the 
idea another try. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, spectators could catch a glimpse of 1990s surf culture as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At the staging area for the Longboard Surfing Championships, 23-year-old Brady 
Mitchell waxed his surfboard while listening to the blaring rock music of Pearl 
Jam echoing from a nearby stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really cool," Mitchell said. This was the first time the Thousand Oaks 
native had surfed in the beach-party competition, held in choppy seas off 
Surfer's Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura resident Daniel Maligro, who was surfing in the men's 40- to 
49-year-old division, said Saturday's ocean conditions were as rough as the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy if I get through my first heat," said Maligro, who has surfed in 
the long board competition for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get to meet a lot of nice people here," he said. "I come out every year 
because it's part of the city. It's city pride." California Beach Party Events

 The California Beach Party continues from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today on the beach 
promenade near downtown Ventura. Some sporting events start earlier. Admission 
is $5.50 for adults, $3.50 for senior citizens and free for children 12 and

KEEPER OF THE OAKS; CITY'S LANDSCAPE CONSULTANT MAY BE LEFT OUT ON A LIMB

<P>
 Eyes fixed on his quarry, George Moore stalked along the sidewalk, a fit man 
with blondish hair and graying beard, already outraged at the crime he was 
poised to unveil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About to pounce, Moore stopped short next to the sinner -- or, in this case, 
the sinned upon. 
</P>
<P>
 A spindly trunked oak tree along Hodencamp Road had been pruned into a tidy 
ball-shaped mound. If left alone, the tree would have sprawled its branches 
into the evocative, inviting tangles so characteristic of oaks. But clippers 
and snippers had confined it into a cramped circle -- clear evidence of illegal 
topiary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tree's been trimmed improperly," Moore announced. 
</P>
<P>
 As Thousand Oaks' landscape consultant, he should know. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a quarter of a century, Moore has been in charge of safeguarding 
the city's namesake oaks. For almost a decade, he's been responsible for 
checking the landscaping programs of every residential, commercial and 
industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
 He sends dead trees to the buzz saw, saves old trees from the bulldozer and 
supervises implementation of the city code that requires builders to plant 
three new oaks for every one chopped down. Moore also reports shady goings-on, 
such as the illegally trimmed oak on Hodencamp, to code enforcement officers 
for follow-up action. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has provided a great service to the city," Principal Planner Paul 
Metrovitsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Moore is fighting to retain the job he's held since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 New city guidelines require each department to hire consultants only after a 
competitive bidding process to ensure that "we get the best individual at the 
lowest price," Metrovitsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 After soliciting proposals from landscape architects across Ventura County, 
city staff last week interviewed nine candidates and will select finalists by 
early this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore is eager to keep his job, which brings in $50 an hour and takes about 20 
hours a week. But several of his competitors said they think that Thousand 
Oaks' oaks, not to mention the peppers and sycamores, deserve a caretaker with 
fresh eyes and a new attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of Moore centers around one main charge: He plays favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays favorites with plants, that is, rejecting some landscape designs simply 
because he's not fond of, or not familiar with, a particular type of ground 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, he isn't real objective," said Jo Ann Hutchison-Rosdahl, a 
Camarillo landscape architect bidding for the Thousand Oaks consulting job. 
"That tends to happen over time. It gets to be like, no one can use those 
plants because I don't like them." 
</P>
<P>
 A friendly rival who is not competing for the Thousand Oaks job, landscape 
architect James Dean describes Moore as "a controversial person, very 
opinionated." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore is "thorough, good and talented," Dean said, but "he might be a little 
inflexible. He has very definite opinions, and he doesn't back down." 
</P>
<P>
 To that, Moore offers a ready response. 
</P>
<P>
 In reviewing landscape plans, he said he tries to be conservative and 
cautious, sticking to plants that he knows will grow well in the soil and 
climate. "No one knows micro-climates in Thousand Oaks better than I do," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He admits a distaste for certain species -- he derides palm trees, for 
example, as "telephone poles with a little tuft of hair on top." 
</P>
<P>
 But in general, Moore said, his bias is simply pro-green. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this city, I'm known as a bit hard-nosed because I really can't see the 
point of paving over the whole city," Moore said, risking ant bites as he 
leaned against a 400-year-old tree. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid surfer who hits Ventura beaches each morning, 55-year-old Moore 
developed his aversion to pavement while growing up in the then-rural San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents, fleeing the numbing uniformity of suburban tract houses, moved 
from Hawthorne to North Hollywood when he was young, then jumped from an orange 
orchard in Northridge to a walnut grove in Van Nuys to a small horse ranch in 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Tending the horses seemed a lot more appealing than sweeping up after pepper 
trees, so Moore decided to study animal husbandry when he entered Pierce 
College. But a landscape design class caught his fancy, and he soon embarked on 
a new career -- with a passel of credits and a state license, but no college 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks of trees lovingly, like a kindly family doctor, fussing over their 
circulatory systems when the leaves look funny and poking at the bark when the 
branches appear dead. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is simple: to keep Thousand Oaks looking lush and verdant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a tough job," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said. "These are 
challenging times for someone of such dedication (to trees) because of the 
enormous pressures" for development. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the pressures, Moore thinks that Thousand Oaks can evade the 
creeping concrete that has overtaken the San Fernando Valley, especially if the 
council approves a strict forestry law up for a public hearing later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The forestry law, proposed last spring and sent back to staff for revision, 
would require city permits for all branch-pruning or tree trimming. If passed, 
the law would extend the city's strong defense of oaks to all trees within 
Thousand Oaks, including those on private property. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sweeping protection makes sense to Josephine Maturo, a homeowners 
association representative on the Thousand Oaks Tree Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look around at all our oak trees here, I think, 'Thank God for Mr. 
Moore,' " Maturo said. "He's very personable, he's very fair and he's the No. 1 
guy with our oak trees." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Moore helped draft the original oak ordinance back in 1971 on the 
theory that preserving trees would save the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hills and canyons and barrancas you still see in Thousand Oaks, a lot of 
them are here because of the oak trees," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the law protects oaks, he said, the gnarly, knotty trees in turn 
protect the environment. If developers have to save pockets of green to keep an 
oak and its roots intact, then they can't engage in wholesale grading or 
filling, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a landscape architect who often works for large developers, John Innes can 
testify to Moore's hard line against tree destruction. But he's more concerned 
about his perception that Moore resists using new hybrids or untested varieties 
of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Innes, who has applied for the Thousand Oaks consultant job, recalled 
encountering "a lot of resistance" when he submitted a landscape plan using a 
hybrid crape myrtle. "George doesn't like new plants," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, that conservative streak pays off. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean remembers feeling infuriated when Moore turned down his proposal to 
spread ivy around a residential development on Lynn Road in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore insisted that the ground cover would provide a haven for rats. Dean 
dismissed that excuse as irrelevant because no rats lived in the area. But 
Moore, predicting future rodent infestation, held his ground. Reluctantly, Dean 
chose a different plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's stubborn anti-ivy policy was soon vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out he was right and we did develop a rat problem in that area," 
Dean said. "Now, I don't use ivy."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY TO CONSIDER COUNTYWIDE BUS PASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley bus riders will be able to travel farther for the same amount of 
money if the City Council approves the use of a countywide pass at Monday's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The passes would be good on Simi Valley buses, intercity buses and those in 
other cities that approve the plan.Several cities are considering approving the 
$34 monthly passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ease with which you can ride with a single pass and the new intercity 
service will likely increase ridership," said Judy Collins, deputy director of 
Community Services for Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said the Ventura County Transportation Commission plans to sell the 
new passes this summer when it starts its new intercity bus service. Money from 
the passes will be divided based on the number of riders within each city, she 
said. SCOTT HADLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; REAGAN LIBRARY ACCEPTS NOTES TO NIXON FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Admirers of former President Richard Nixon may write their condolences to the 
family of the late leader in a book on display at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials have set up a large photo of the former President in the 
library and plan to send the book with its written messages to the Nixon family 
as a reminder of Nixon's continued respect in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, who was a longtime friend of former President Ronald Reagan, visited 
the Reagan Library twice, most recently last July just a month after his wife, 
Pat, died. On his first trip, Nixon joined former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and 
Jimmy Carter and then-President George Bush in helping to dedicate the building 
when it opened in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The library is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sundays 
from noon to 5 p.m. Those who wish to sign the book without paying admission to 
enter the library may do so at the front desk, library officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For regular visitors, admission prices are $4 for general admission and $2 for 
senior citizens. Children younger than 15 are admitted free. For more 
information, call 522-8444. SCOTT HADLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PROGRAM FOR HOME BUYERS TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Offering lower interest rates and easier terms, the city of Simi Valley hopes 
that a revised first-time home buyers program to be considered by the City 
Council at its Monday meeting will attract more customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Local residents lost interest in buying a home through the city's program 
because the economy faltered and the city could not offer a competitive 
interest rate, said Dulce Conde-Serra, deputy director of the city's housing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Conde-Serra said just three people entered the program since 1992, whereas 
more than 60 received loans from the city from 1989 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the program will have a $160,000 loan limit for median-income 
families, defined as a family of four earning $55,000 a year, and a limit of 
$120,000 for low-income families, defined as a family of four earning $39,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will market the loans through a local bank, Conde-Serra said, 
although it has not been chosen yet. SCOTT HADLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 5 ARRESTED IN SWAT RAID OF 2 HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A police SWAT team raided two houses in a west Ventura neighborhood early 
Saturday, arresting five people in connection with repeated incidents of random 
gunfire that terrorized local residents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the series of shootings earlier this month, but a number 
of houses and cars were struck by bullets in the early morning of April 14 and 
16, a Ventura Police Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten so bad lately it's almost an everyday occurrence," said longtime 
resident Patricia Davis, who lives on Mission Street. "My next-door neighbor 
told me today that she was going to move out because the shooting is getting 
too close." 
</P>
<P>
 Using search warrants in their 1:30 a.m. sweep, police confiscated two 
handguns and an undisclosed amount of narcotics from a house in the 100 block 
of West Harrison Avenue and the 100 block of West Mission Avenue, police said. 
The two streets are west of Ventura Avenue and run parallel to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb squad was summoned during the search of the Harrison Avenue house 
after police found a device that appeared to be a military explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said she heard what sounded like two explosions just before police 
arrived. But bomb experts determined that the device was inert. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings were still under investigation and the names of the suspects had 
not been released late Saturday, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said she keeps a police scanner nearby, which makes her feel safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think other people are scared, though," she said. "They're really scared."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; MARKET OWNER ROBBED, TIED UP BY GUNMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a neighborhood market in Santa Paula was confronted by an armed 
man, robbed and tied up after she opened her store Saturday morning, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man apparently broke into Gil's Market at 1220 Saticoy St. and waited for 
the owner to open her business just before 9 a.m., Santa Paula police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner, whose name was not released, was forced to open the safe and hand 
over an undisclosed amount of cash to the gunman, a police spokesman said. 
After robbing the woman, the gunman tied her up and then fled. She was able to 
escape soon after and was unharmed, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 No description of the suspect was provided by police, who said the robbery is 
under investigation. SCOTT HADLY

CAMPAIGN TO RECALL 3 MEMBERS OF SIMI SCHOOL BOARD UNRAVELS; EDUCATION: 
ORGANIZERS SAY EFFORT LOST MOMENTUM BECAUSE OF EARTHQUAKE AND A STABBING. 
OPPONENTS SAY IT NEVER REALLY GOT OFF THE GROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recall campaign hastily organized five months ago to oust three Simi Valley 
school board members appears to have unraveled -- and leaders of the effort say 
the Jan. 17 earthquake is partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the recall effort said the campaign lost momentum after the 
earthquake and the fatal stabbing of a 14-year-old student at Valley View 
Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Some supporters of the recall effort are now involved in studying issues of 
campus safety or are preoccupied with repairing their homes, said Don Otto, a 
spokesman for the recall group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever hits your pocketbook, home, families and safety of kids -- that has 
a tendency to take a much higher priority over trying to stay active and make 
changes in our school district," he said. "It's a tough time." 
</P>
<P>
 Otto said no formal decision has been made to abandon the recall, but he 
characterized the effort as "on hold." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign was launched last fall by a group of parents angry at board 
members Carla Kurachi, Diane Collins and Debbie Sandland. All three had voted 
against a plan to establish four-year high schools, and had favored adding 
information on birth control to the district's sex education curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling themselves Parents Aligned for Children's Education, or PACE, the 
loose-knit coalition announced plans to collect the 8,232 signatures needed on 
each of three petitions to force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the November ballot -- when board members Kurachi and Doug 
Crosse are up for reelection -- supporters of the recall would have to turn 
those signatures in to county election officials by May 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto will not say how many signatures have been collected, but another early 
supporter of the recall said the group had just begun to canvass voters when 
the effort began to lose steam. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recall drive at this point is kind of done and over with," said Janice 
DiFatta, a member of the Simi Valley PTA Council who at first had supported the 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Otto's claim that several hundred people initially supported the 
recall, opponents question whether the campaign ever got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Sandland and Collins said they believe the recall's organizers are 
using the issue of school safety and the Valley View stabbing to cover up a 
lack of support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's sort of face saving," Collins said. "It was a roaring 
failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Collins and Sandland said they took seriously the threat of 
being unseated. Along with board President Kurachi, they spent five or six 
weekends talking with voters at shopping centers around Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said the fact that a Simi Valley mayor and city councilman were 
recalled in 1979 made her all the more concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take it seriously. A recall is very hard to defeat if it gets the 
signatures (needed to put it on the ballot)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandland said she won't feel comfortable until after the May 10 deadline 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very stressful," she said. "You're new on the board and people say, 
'OK, let's get her out of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over sex education erupted last spring when Sandland proposed 
adding birth control information to the curriculum for students in the seventh 
and 10th grades. After months of debate, the board voted 5 to 0 in February to 
include some information on birth control while stressing abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, Sandland and Kurachi voted against the plan to establish four-year 
high schools, while board members Judy Barry and Crosse supported it. Sandland 
had campaigned against the reconfiguration in 1992, saying it would cost the 
district too much money. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said she believes the board's unanimous vote on the birth control 
issue and the cost of staging a recall election -- estimated at $50,000 to 
$80,000 -- helped erode support for the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 DiFatta said supporters of the recall came together out of frustration and 
anger over the two issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't anybody out to destroy the school district, it was just parents who 
were angry with what they felt was going on in the district," DiFatta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto said that even if the recall effort dies in the next few weeks, he 
believes the issues behind it will surface in the campaign for the two school 
board seats in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins agreed, saying: "I think there's going to be a couple candidates in 
the November elections who are quite conservative, and those people will 
probably be supported by the core group of the recall."

COYOTE PROBLEM IS A THREAT TO HOME BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the city instituted the ban on trapping coyotes, the public safety 
concerns of homeowners have become resounding. But another concern is already 
upon us. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the danger and because of the enormity of local news coverage, 
would-be home buyers, particularly parents and pet owners, are becoming 
increasingly leery of buying in our neighborhoods -- and with good reason.  
</P>
<P>
 Do our City Council members honestly believe that homeowners will not mete out 
some retribution in the voting booth if they continue to allow the degradation 
of our primary financial assets, our homes? 
</P>
<P>
 Do they think that homeowners, homeowner associations and realtors faced with 
a new public disclosure issue are going to look the other way as they get hit 
in the pocketbook? 
</P>
<P>
 Think again.

CAVALRY HAS ARRIVED WITH LANDMARK LOAN; SBA CAN RESCUE OTHER QUAKE-DAMAGED 
COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first, it figured to be another dreaded brick in the road toward the San 
Fernando Valley's financial ruin; another firm that had found persuasive 
reasons to abandon California for parts East. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the problem was massive earthquake damage, so much of it that Dan 
Sandel's Chatsworth-based Devon Industries Inc. might have simply merged with 
its Ohio plant rather than rebuild here. Sandel had no earthquake insurance, 
and part of the wreckage at his production facility included $2.8 million in 
machinery that had been reduced to scrap metal. California's supposedly 
"inhospitable" business climate also figured heavily in the possible exodus of 
this self-made Israeli entrepreneur and naturalized American. 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, figures to be a good-news story for the Valley and for Los 
Angeles as a whole. We could certainly use one. 
</P>
<P>
 It was announced this past week that the federal Small Business Administration 
was expected to approve the largest loan made yet by the agency since the 
quake. It would mean that Sandel would: receive a $10-million low-interest 
loan, swallow his gripes about the California business climate, rebuild his 
largest plant, replace destroyed machines, upgrade operations and remain in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 If this loan proceeds apace, kudos will also be in order for the Valley 
Industry and Commerce Assn. (VICA). For companies with fewer than 1,000 
employees, SBA disaster loans are normally limited to no more than $1.5 
million. That amount would not even have covered Sandel's equipment losses. But 
VICA, whose clout in past years has been questionable at best, successfully 
lobbied the SBA to let companies with as few as 250 employees qualify for large 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 That opened up the large loan eligibility ranks for Sandel's company, and for 
several other small and mid-size firms that are desperately in need of the 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Good-news stories generally carry a caveat of some kind, however. This one 
also involves the SBA and the number of requests for assistance that it has 
received. For every story like Sandel's, there are dozens more business owners 
who are teetering on the brink of financial disaster. The scope of it alone is 
amazing, even in comparison to other major disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first month after Florida was struck by Hurricane Andrew, the SBA 
received 5,704 disaster loan applications from its victims. The SBA received 
just 4,663 applications within the first month of last year's devastating 
Midwest floods. By the time a month had passed after the Northridge quake, the 
SBA had received 46,023 applications, and it was running weeks behind its own 
standards for verifying damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays have even caused some initial applicants to drop out of the 
process. If your business did this, you have made a huge mistake and should 
return to the process as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA loan money was not forthcoming for nearly a year after the 1987 Whittier 
Narrows earthquake, according to a study funded by the National Science 
Foundation, even though the Whittier business district had sustained massive 
damage. By contrast, groups such as Operation USA, an international, nonprofit, 
disaster relief and development organization, believe that the SBA is doing a 
much more efficient job now with a larger and more complicated lineup of aid 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, this is no time for groups such as VICA or local elected officials to 
relax. The Sandel case points out the importance of encouraging prompt SBA 
assistance. Without such possibilities, the Valley would have lost all or part 
of a business with 375 employees, one that has also played a key role in the 
community by employing and housing formerly homeless people. Its rescue is an 
important symbol of what is needed to recover from the Northridge quake.

GUN CONTROL LAWS ONLY VICTIMIZE THE INNOCENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The story "Slain Rescuer Was North Hills Man" (April 12) might well have been 
"North Hills Man Rescues Woman and Slays Attacker" had kind and generous Jose 
Felix Garcia Mercado been able to exercise the right to bear arms as granted by 
the Second Amendment to the Constitution. He might very well be alive today, 
and The Times could report one bad guy eliminated while two good people 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, the story "Teen-Age Intruder Under Influence of LSD Shot to Death 
by Homeowner" might well have been "Homeowner, Wife and 6-Month-Old Daughter 
Slain by LSD-Crazed Teen-Age Intruder." That could have happened if Keith Wood 
not been able to protect his family because the Los Angeles Times and anti-gun 
politicians had been successful in infringing on his right to bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a law-abiding, taxpaying citizen who honorably served my country. I have 
safely owned and handled firearms for 50 years, and I feel safe and secure as 
long as I have my Second Amendment right. Gun control laws have not and will 
not stop the criminal element from obtaining guns. These laws only make it 
easier to victimize the innocent.

REVERSING THE CHARGES FOR THE TAXPAYER; VALLEY SUPERVISOR'S $1.2-MILLION 
MISTAKE CREATES INTEREST IN NEW ETHICS LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A matter that the Times Valley Edition dubbed the "most expensive telephone 
call by a public official" has inspired keen interest in Sacramento. As 
Steinbeck might have put it, the bills authored by Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and 
Debra Bowen (D-Marina Del Rey) rolled through the Assembly in greased grooves. 
The bills, now pending in the state Senate, would force politicians -- not 
taxpayers -- to foot the bill for court costs and damages that result from 
their illegal or unethical conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was inspired by Supervisor Mike Antonovich's unspecified share 
of a $1.2-million civil judgment last year in which he was found liable by a 
jury for conspiring to influence a judge on behalf of a campaign contributor. . 
.in a phone call. By agreement of all parties, Los Angeles County lawyers said 
that the county would pay for Antonovich's role in reaching out and touching 
the wrong person at the wrong time. The case is under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich maintains that he did nothing improper five years ago in 
telephoning Judge Eric Younger to offer a character reference for Antonovich 
campaign donor Krikor Suri and Suri's jewelry business partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich did tell the San Gabriel Valley Tribune: "In hindsight, I would not 
have done it." The judge was in charge of a case pitting Suri against another 
small businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are wondering about the Katz and Bowen bills, we've a little something 
to add to your thinking. The sum of $1.2 million would pay for one-third of the 
cost to complete plans for the Antelope Valley courthouse Antonovich has pushed 
for. It would surely help out those cash-strapped county library branches 
Antonovich supports so strongly. It would pay half the cost of restoring the 
Eaton Canyon Nature Center, another interest of Antonovich's. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the matter has had a chilling effect. "It really makes you think 
twice before picking up the phone on behalf of somebody," said a supervisor's 
deputy. Well, if the "somebody" is a campaign contributor and the person being 
called is the judge handling their case, second thoughts are wise . . . and 
free.

LAPD DOESN'T ASK CITIZENS TO POLICE THE STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a senior lead officer of the Van Nuys division of the Los Angeles Police 
Department and the officer most knowledgeable about the two mini-malls in 
question, I feel compelled to respond to the misinformation contained in the 
April 3 opinion article by Gideon Kanner of Loyola Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious the he did no research before taking pen in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He stated that the Los Angeles Police Department and the city attorney's 
office are turning citizens into victims by asking them to patrol their own 
storefronts and confront criminals, or face criminal prosecution themselves. 
That is simply not true. No member of the Los Angeles Police Department would 
ever put a citizen in the position of having to confront or arrest criminals. 
Those duties belong to police officers, and may I say that our officers do a 
great job in that arena! 
</P>
<P>
 When I was assigned to this position four years ago, my goal was to clean up 
west Van Nuys by putting criminals in jail and working in partnership with 
citizens who live and work in Van Nuys, so their lives would be safer. 
</P>
<P>
 My attention was directed to the mini-mall on southwest Sepulveda and Roscoe 
by numerous citizen complaints of drug deals, prostitution and gang activity. 
This corner was so well-known for criminal activity that people from as far as 
Ventura County, Glendale and Lancaster traveled to engage in crime. One evening 
my partner and I worked undercover at this site. We observed about 100 drug 
transactions. Unfortunately we were only able to arrest about 25 people for 
selling or buying because we couldn't keep up with the activity. 
</P>
<P>
 I took a close look at this mini-mall and wondered why it was so inviting to 
this type of criminal activity. I noticed the area was poorly lit, the building 
lacked "No Trespassing" signs and the property was dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 I contacted the owner of the complex and advised him of the condition of his 
property and the nature of the criminal activity occurring. He indicated he 
wanted no part in cleaning up the property. Instead, he sold the property. The 
business owners in the complex had simply turned their heads to the activity 
occurring on their property. They denied the existence of criminal activity. 
Some merchants even allowed crimes to be committed in their stores. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Vanowen/Sepulveda mini-mall, it has narcotics and prostitution 
problems. The complaints and restrictions placed on these businesses are due to 
citizen complaints. The citizens initiated a hearing before the zoning 
administrator for these restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Kanner can ride with me any time for a firsthand look. I hope future 
articles will accurately reflect what his eyes have seen.

GLENDALE'S PIGEON FLAP IS FOR THE BIRDS; MESSY FOWL ARE NO LONGER SITTING DUCKS 
BUT CITY NEEDS A PLAN THAT WILL FLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the annals of so-called animal rights (some would say the outrageously 
overblown annals), few could have anticipated much interest in the plight of 
the pigeon. Its name, for example, denotes many things, none of them positive. 
Human pigeons are easily deceived. Stool pigeons can't keep their mouths shut. 
We hate to be pigeonholed (labeled), and, of course, there are the 
pigeon-hearted (cowards). 
</P>
<P>
 So, leave it to the city of Glendale to come up with a plan so distasteful 
that it caused folks to rise to the defense of these dung-bombers, the same 
birds that have been likened to rats with wings. City officials said it would 
be OK to stage a "coo d'etat," so to speak, by shoving pigeons into plastic 
bags and hooking the sacks up to vehicle exhaust pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those otherwise outraged by piles of bird poop in downtown Glendale soon 
denounced this "fowl play." A Washington, D.C.-based animal rights group noted 
that the exhaust would "burn their eyes." Well, yes it would, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Suitably chastened, Glendale city officials are seeking other solutions and 
now insist that, well, bird murdering will be a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Answers, however, may be hard to come by. One idea, for example, would involve 
the spiking of pigeon corn feed with a birth-control substance. Complaints 
about this plan can no doubt be expected from people who believe that young 
pigeons would not have been thinking about sex in the first place if no one had 
mentioned birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 One East Coast city tried lining its more precious sites with faux falcons and 
hawks. But the pigeons regarded them as eminently comfortable perches -- even 
pigeons get suspicious if a hawk hasn't moved a feather in weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Glendale's guano problem is severe, and the city must act soon, lest 
someone accuse it of being pigeon-livered (timid).

DON'T THINK OF PIGEONS AS 'ROACHES OF THE SKY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Glendale's plan to trap and kill pigeons: There are 
alternatives to this ill-conceived plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Birth control substances can be placed into feed.Plaster owls can be placed on 
rooftops where pigeons gather. Netting can be effectively used on certain 
roosting areas.  
</P>
<P>
 To exterminate all pigeons based upon the erroneous assumption that they are 
"roaches of the sky" and carriers of disease is both ludicrous and cruel.  
</P>
<P>
 What proof does the city of Glendale have that pigeons carry disease? Is the 
evidence great enough to condemn an entire species? 
</P>
<P>
 Are these strategies based on science, or are they structured to appease a 
small, self-interested minority? 
</P>
<P>
 Has the city of Glendale considered the emotions of the many citizens who 
enjoy pigeons, who enjoy feeding and caring for them, and who would be outraged 
to see them senselessly destroyed?

BEILENSON HELPED KILL ANTI-CRIME MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As usual, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson's rhetoric has run smack into his record. 
During recent deliberations for the 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill, Beilenson used his 
position on the powerful Rules Committee to kill a number of positive, 
effective anti-crime amendments, merely because they were Republican-sponsored. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for bipartisan spirit and an end to gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the amendments he helped defeat: 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishment of a tracking center to help identify, incarcerate and deport 
illegal immigrants who are criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision to prohibit possession of a firearm at or near a day-care center 
or a community center. 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision requiring criminals convicted of federal crimes to make 
restitution to their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision to authorize grants to states that enact laws revoking the 
driver's license of anyone who brings a handgun into schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of a new category of federal prosecution against "child abuse and 
endangerment." 
</P>
<P>
 * A ban on 175 specifically named semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson claims to be concerned about the impact of illegal immigration, and 
yet he voted against concrete provisions that address those issues. 
</P>
<P>
 He claims that crime is a "state problem," and yet when faced with a chance to 
effect positive solutions, he opposes them. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it because the ideas were proposed by Republicans? If so, this represents 
"politics as usual" at its worst. The people of this district don't care whose 
ideas they are. We just want the best solutions possible.

BERMAN SHOULD TOUGHEN STAND ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony Beilenson (Valley Commentary, April 17) accurately points out 
that we are being strangled by the vast influx of illegals and proposes that we 
both close the borders and amend the Constitution to stop allowing illegals to 
cross the border, have a baby and then be eligible for all the taxpayer 
benefits granted to American citizens. Rep. Howard Berman opposes the latter 
step. 
</P>
<P>
 The great majority of citizens are in favor of amending the 14th Amendment, 
which was enacted right after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole purpose of the clause in question was to protect the newly freed 
slaves. No one at the time contemplated great social outlays to foreign 
citizens taking advantage of American hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, Mr. Berman. The majority of us do not want this. You are merely our 
representative and as such are empowered only to carry out the wishes of the 
majority and not those of your own social agenda.

PROGRAM REWARDS GOOD GRADES; PASADENA: THE GOAL IS TO MOTIVATE NEIGHBORHOOD 
CHILDREN AND TEEN-AGERS TO DO BETTER IN SCHOOL BY RECOGNIZING THEIR 
ACHIEVEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the time Pasadena Mayor Rick Cole finished talking to the 15 schoolchildren 
packed into a tidy house on the north end of Navarro Street, two things were 
clear: These wide-eyed youngsters don't lack for ideas, and a hotdog barbecue 
might be one way to end interminable council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole spent a good part of a recent Saturday morning discussing the ups and 
downs of being mayor with youths participating in the Navarro 
Avenue-Tremont-Howard Assn. (NATHA) Scholastic Achievement Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole told the youths, ages 8 to 18, that one of the ups is that he can help 
improve the city he loves. On the downside, he said, he only earns $4,000 a 
year -- not the $1 million one young boy guessed a mayor brings home. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for his time, the children gave the mayor an earful of ideas for 
bettering Pasadena. Among them were giving unwanted appliances to the homeless 
and electing the mayor by popular vote. Only the smell of charcoal-broiled 
hotdogs kept the youths from staging a referendum on the latter issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The barbecue was a light finish to a gathering with a serious purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The career presentation -- a regular part of the NATHA meetings held at the 
home of Joseph Rodriguez and Sonya Hildreth-Rodriguez -- are aimed at steering 
young people away from the streets by encouraging academic achievement and 
introducing vocational options. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATHA program is the brainchild of a crime watch group turned neighborhood 
association. It is being praised locally as a model of community activism. 
</P>
<P>
 The program seeks to motivate neighborhood children and teen-agers to do 
better in school by rewarding their achievements.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who stay enrolled and maintain a "C" average or better get to go to 
Magic Mountain at the end of the school year. Those who earn a 3.4 grade point 
average, or boost their grades two points, will spend a week in August in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing these incentives, program organizers identify 
tutoring needs by monitoring report cards and talking to teachers, then 
directing students to nearby programs. At last count, 23 of the 38 youths who 
started the program had stuck with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of grass-roots self-help is really much better than the government 
programs of the past," Cole said after the meeting he attended. He said the 
NATHA program is an example of -- and model for -- a growing neighborhood 
movement in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most positive thing that is happening, parents not waiting for 
programs to solve their problems. This neighborhood recognized that their 
problem was that the kids needed help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navarro Avenue block between Tremont and Howard streets started a crime 
watch last year because rampant drug-selling was attracting crime and violence 
to their street, according to frustrated residents. Soon, organizers focused on 
helping youths in the neighborhood even though most of their own children were 
grown. 
</P>
<P>
 NATHA member Ted Smith said that during one of the crime watch meetings, 
treasurer Betty Coleman suggested that in addition to monitoring crime on the 
street, the group should do something for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith proposed paying the youths to get good grades, and Harry Washington, 
also active in the crime watch, suggested a trip to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Smith said, "it snowballed." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime watch group, led by Coleman, Washington, Smith and the Rodriguezes, 
formed the neighborhood association a year ago and recruited youths to help 
design and participate in NATHA's scholastic program. The city helped with a 
$5,000 grant, and the experiment kicked off this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said that even though many of the organizers do not have children in 
the program, their motivation is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like kids are losing out on so much because of crime," Coleman said. 
"You get tired of seeing them die. This is really important to them because you 
know they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 NATHA hopes to improve the program next year by working more closely with the 
school system, reaching out to more at-risk youths and providing counseling as 
well as tutorial services.

 "We are trying," said Hildreth-Rodriguez, NATHA's president. "We are all 
amateurs. But, hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes and build." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodriguezes said one of the biggest challenges will be finding funds to 
expand the program. NATHA is applying to a number of foundations for support.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; ON TRACK FOR PROSPERITY; UNDERGROUND MASS TRANSIT STATIONS 
OFTEN BECOME CLUSTERS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. NORTH HOLLYWOOD'S SUBWAY STATION 
SHOULD BE NO EXCEPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One nice thing about a public works project that advances at the stately pace 
of the Mendenhall Glacier is that, over the years, you personally get to see it 
in a sort of historic perspective. Moreover, since it's coming for decades, 
there's plenty of time to get out of the way -- or into its path. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood subway line was first approved in 1975. I thought it was a 
good idea because it would help fight smog, to which I am allergic, and 
commuting headaches, to which I am even more allergic. 
</P>
<P>
 If the construction equipment recently installed among the ruined buildings at 
Lankershim and Chandler boulevards is for real -- not the set of "Earthquake 
II" -- then the NoHo subway station is finally being built. It will link the 
San Fernando Valley to the Metro Red Line tunneling its way under the Hollywood 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 It's coming right at me, and I can hardly wait. 
</P>
<P>
 I became a North Hollywood homeowner specifically to take advantage of the 
subway. From what I have seen and read, the station is going to enhance my 
investment a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My view crystallized several years ago when I was on business in another city 
that has a working subway. I was up in a tall building something like the 
Universal City Hilton, looking out over a flat cityscape rather like the 
Valley. I noticed a strange pattern of trees and buildings stretching into the 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was rather like the green patches that form around underground lawn 
sprinkler heads during water rationing times -- spots where the lawn is still 
OK even though the rest of the grass has turned brown. The "sprinklers" were 
commercial developments around what I learned were underground mass transit 
stations. The greenery was the result of prosperity: public and private 
landscaping in the neighborhoods right around the stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was Toronto. I had seen something similar on visits to Atlanta, Miami 
and Washington, but the idea didn't click until that trip. Within a few months 
I had bought a house in NoHo. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course I won't be able to ride the subway for another seven years, but I 
have been making some inquiries about what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Our local transit people certainly think I have the right attitude. By their 
reckoning, commercial real estate within half a mile of each station should 
rightly be subject to a "special benefit assessment," a kind of tax on the 
presumed extra income the owners will enjoy because of their location. Luckily, 
as a homeowner I'm exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic analyses on file at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are 
encouraging too. They indicate that "densification" or increased building is 
likely to happen only in the commercial realm, right up close to the station. 
The houses nearby don't seem destined to fall to the wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This was confirmed by my own observations in other towns. The neighborhoods 
around close-in suburban subway stations comparable to NoHo don't go to hell. 
In Washington and the San Francisco Bay Area, similar neighborhoods became 
quite fashionable. The experience of Sacramento and San Diego with light-rail 
stations is heartening. 
</P>
<P>
 I also read that in Switzerland, where conservative investment is a national 
religion, they've just voted to lay rails instead of roads between towns. Their 
reasons are environmental, but they wouldn't do it if it threatened land 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 One anecdote about Atlanta came to my attention. Merchants in that city's 
version of CityWalk threatened suit if a rapid transit station were to be 
installed anywhere nearby. This contrasted with the strenuous efforts of 
Universal CityWalk's management, MCA, to have station entrance installed right 
at their front door. The Atlanta merchants relented, by the way, with good 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami had a ferocious land boom, fueled by speculation, some years ago along 
the route of a new elevated train. Property values have remained high, although 
ridership never reached predicted levels. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this real estate stuff is exactly new. A recent history of the New 
York subway, "722 Miles," by Clifton Hood, has pictures of open fields in the 
suburbs in 1910 strung with ribbons marking proposed streets around spots where 
subway stations were soon to pop up. The subway created a residential land boom 
wherever it was built. 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened in 1911 when the fabled Red Car trolley line first 
arrived in North Hollywood. Money, it seems, always follows the tracks.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; SCHOOL DISTRICT'S LESSON: WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, SUE; THE 
LAUSD'S ATTEMPT TO INVALIDATE THE WARNER CENTER SPECIFIC PLAN SHROUDS AN AGENDA 
AIMED AT HAVING BUSINESS RESCUE OFFICIALS FROM THEIR OWN MISMANAGEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 First, the longest recession in 50 years. Then a 6.8 earthquake. Now, the Los 
Angeles Unified School District is attacking the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the Valley is starting to recuperate, LAUSD threatens the recovery 
with a lawsuit filed last year against the city of Los Angeles aimed at 
extracting millions of dollars in additional fees from developers. The suit, 
which has citywide implications, is scheduled for trial in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 LAUSD is suing the city to invalidate the city's Warner Center Specific Plan, 
alleging that its environmental impact report does not include adequate steps 
to mitigate the impact of the project on air quality, noise and traffic at 
public schools. The suit asks for millions of dollars right now, before any 
development takes place, to provide air-conditioning and air-filtration systems 
(and lifetime maintenance of those systems) at Canoga Park High School and 
Parkman Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the school district is looking to others to solve its financial 
problems instead of addressing its own mismanagement. This is not the first 
time LAUSD has tried to sue a local government for this purpose. Its pattern is 
to sue and then agree to withdraw the suit for a sum of money. The city of Los 
Angeles says it won't tolerate LAUSD's threats, however. It is standing by the 
Warner Center Specific Plan and the environmental impact report for several 
good reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is designed to guide further development at Warner Center in Woodland 
Hills. The area it governs does not include the controversial Warner Ridge 
project just east of De Soto Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The specific plan was approved by the City Council on June 30, 1993, after an 
eight-year process in which residents, businesses and governmental 
decision-makers reached a consensus -- an unusual event for even the smallest 
projects. Of all those involved in dozens of workshops and hearings, only the 
school district opposed it. City Council member Laura Chick, whose district 
includes Warner Center, called the plan "a crucial blueprint for balanced 
growth in the San Fernando Valley's most important commercial center." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, any real detrimental impacts on schoolchildren that may result from 
the plan should be mitigated. In approving the environmental impact report, the 
City Council expressed confidence that they had been. The city attorney also 
stands by the report and promises to defend the city vigorously against this 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan creates a $9-million "neighborhood protection fund" to be collected 
from developers. It will provide money to constituents, including the school 
district, for mitigation measures beyond those specified in the environmental 
impact report. The fund will be directed by a committee appointed by Chick. The 
principals of Canoga Park High School and Parkman Middle School sit on the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 State law also allows school districts to assess developers 27 cents per 
square foot of commercial development. That means $6 million for LAUSD from 
Warner Center. With the student population shrinking in the West Valley, the 
school district doesn't need the money to build new schools but can use it at 
existing ones for such items such as air conditioning, landscaping and 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the school district's finances so poorly managed that it can't find the 
resources to provide air conditioning at two schools without suing the city or 
hitting up developers for more money? It doesn't send a friendly message. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the city of Los Angeles nor real estate developers are in any economic 
state to bail out LAUSD. The business community is still reeling from the 
recession and huge earthquake recovery costs. The LAUSD lawsuit puts a cloud 
over the entire Warner Center area just as a few glimmers of light are 
appearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools, the city and the business community should be working together to 
solve the educational and economic problems of the area. Instead, the school 
district is spending taxpayers' money on litigation. If it wins, it is certain 
to try this tactic again. The business community has always been willing to pay 
to protect our schoolchildren and campuses, but we resent the school district's 
adversarial and wasteful approach to getting someone else to pay its bills when 
it ought to be addressing its own fiscal incompetence.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; ARE WE TOO POOR TO DENY KIDS A RICHER EDUCATION?; IT'S A SAD 
SITUATION WHEN ADULTS WHO HAD ACTIVITIES IN SCHOOL LIKE FIELD TRIPS AND SHOP 
CLASSES AREN'T WILLING TO PAY TAXES SO TODAY'S STUDENTS CAN ALSO HAVE THEM.

secondary schools and has produced children's theater in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been thinking about young people lately, and I've come up with some new 
ideas for in-school activities. I think they might stop trouble on campus, keep 
kids away from gangs and divert them from video games. They might even get 
teen-agers interested in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these ideas are pretty radical, I know, but I think the times we are 
living in justify doing some unusual things to get the students focused on 
education and ready for the world they will be graduating into. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are my ideas for additions to the curriculum: 
</P>
<P>
 * ART. We could hire art teachers and make it part of the regular curriculum. 
Art is part of an educated person's life. We try to teach literature, don't we? 
And who knows? Maybe having a place to paint would divert some 
graffiti-sprayers to artwork that's more imaginative and less destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 * MUSIC. Kids love it more than anything, of course, but I suspect that for 
many of them, music means rock and it started with Elvis. Why not teach them a 
little about music through the ages? We could teach the really interested ones 
to play musical instruments. I think we could actually have orchestras in 
elementary schools. By the time the kids got to high school, they could be 
playing serious music at a high level. For the ones who don't care for fancy 
music, we could have high school bands as big as college bands marching at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 * FIELD TRIPS. Part of education could be learning about the city. What if 
once or twice every year, each class got on a bus and went somewhere: a museum, 
a bakery, a dairy, a recycling plant, a landfill, a newspaper, the forest, the 
desert, the mountains, the ocean? It would cost a few bucks for a driver and 
school bus in the middle of the day, but I think it would be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 * LANGUAGE. There are many languages spoken in Los Angeles schools, but not 
many are taught. At a lot of high schools, Spanish and French are about it. 
Wouldn't it be exciting if a student could learn Russian, Italian or even Latin 
in high school? Why, it would be just like college! 
</P>
<P>
 * DRIVER EDUCATION. Have you seen the way young people drive? They all take 
safety courses, only now it happens in traffic school, after they've gotten 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 I know some people will say it would be a waste of time that kids could use to 
learn more about polynomial equations, but I'll bet they'd eat up a driving 
course, and it would be socially useful as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, we could have classroom sessions, showing 15-year-olds videos of 
traffic accidents and giving them safety lectures, and then put them behind the 
wheel alongside instructors. OK, if this is too non-traditional, we could do 
some of it after school. 
</P>
<P>
 * COOKING and SHOP. I guess this is a frill too, but what would be wrong with 
teaching kids how to cook from scratch, sew, do simple carpentry and replace 
the oil in their cars? I know they can order a No. 3 with a Coke from Mickey 
D's, buy a T-shirt from the Gap and get a tuneup at Midas, but some practical 
life skills will come in handy. We could hire specialist teachers who could not 
only tell them how to do things but show them and let them practice, in 
kitchens and workshops right in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I've asked around, and most of these things are already going on here and 
there. But it's hit or miss, depending on whether there's an appropriate 
teacher on the faculty. I'm talking about regular programs, so that everybody . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's that? You say that all these things were once commonplace? That they 
have been disappearing since about, oh, 1978? That the Los Angeles schools, for 
example, don't routinely replace teachers of the more exotic foreign languages 
when they quit or retire? That music education has almost disappeared from 
elementary schools? 
</P>
<P>
 And you say it's because there's no money? For schools? You mean adults who 
had all those advantages when they were in elementary and junior high and high 
school now aren't willing to pay enough in taxes so kids can have them today? 
</P>
<P>
 No money for schools? In California? I can't believe it. I just can't believe 
it.

INGLEWOOD HOPING TO RESCUE ITS IMAGE; TOURISM: OFFICIALS SAY THE CITY HAS BEEN 
UNFAIRLY PORTRAYED AS DANGEROUS. THEY HOPE TO DEPLOY TRUCKS TO ASSIST -- AND 
REASSURE -- VISITORS. 
</P>

<P>
 It is the Achilles heel of the city: the perception that Inglewood is a 
dangerous place. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood is home to the Forum -- where the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team 
and Kings hockey team play -- and to the Hollywood Park horse-racing track. 
</P>
<P>
 But for years, especially since the movie "Grand Canyon" in 1991 painted the 
city as a dangerous place, some tourists and Southland residents have been 
afraid to come here for fear of becoming crime victims. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reduce visitors' fears, officials plan to deploy brightly 
colored rescue vehicles to help motorists stranded by a flat tire, a dead 
battery or an empty gas tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the works is a plan for a city-run radio station to give motorists 
traffic reports and directions to major tourist venues in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The three rescue trucks would patrol the areas surrounding visitor attractions 
in the city and would cost about $22,000 to $25,000 to equip. Part-time drivers 
would be employed for another $25,000, including benefits, said Assistant City 
Manager Norman Cravens. 
</P>
<P>
 "These proposals are aimed at making our visitors feel more comfortable and 
safe in Inglewood," Cravens said. "They're primarily designed to (appease) some 
of the negative perceptions people may have." 
</P>
<P>
 Cravens and others acknowledge that Inglewood has crime. But overall, crime in 
the city has declined since 1978. Over 15 years, the number of serious crimes, 
including homicides, rapes, assaults, auto theft and arson, has dropped from 
10,385 incidents to 8,460. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1992 to 1993, crime dropped in every major category except homicide, 
which rose 19% -- from 37 to 44 slayings -- and rape, which rose 5% -- from 65 
to 68 incidents. Auto theft dropped 12%, grand larceny declined 11% and 
aggravated assault was down 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 But the purpose of the rescue vehicles is to address visitors' fears, not 
police statistics, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor-assistance proposals will be presented first to the Partnership 
for Progress, a consortium of representatives from the Forum, Hollywood Park, 
Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, Centinela Hospital and Inglewood Park 
Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 If the consortium approves the plan, it would then go to the City Council. 
Under the proposal, Partners for Progress would buy the vehicles and the city 
would hire the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A proposal like this fits well," Cravens said, "because we don't really think 
people have fear while they're on the properties at the Forum or Hollywood Park 
-- they all have huge security -- and we don't feel people have any real fear 
when they are on the freeways. This would be perimeter patrol."  
</P>
<P>
 Visitors' fear of Inglewood became a headache for city officials after "Grand 
Canyon," with Steve Martin and Danny Glover, was released in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Sinaguglia, president of the Inglewood Chamber of Commerce, discussed the 
movie as though he were a soldier explaining the battle story behind a 
disfiguring scar. 
</P>
<P>
 With a sense of dread, Sinaguglia watched the movie's hero blunder through a 
tangle of blighted streets and into the arms of a menacing gang. Then came the 
actual wound: "When the hero is asked where he is," Sinaguglia said, "He says 
he is lost in Inglewood! Everybody (was) ready to throw apples and oranges and 
tomatoes at the movie screen." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was shot in Los Angeles, but most people do not know that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire L. Rothman, general manager of the Forum, said crime on the property is 
rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep a file of all things that happen," she said. "It's so infrequent that 
we know every single time when somebody reports having a car scratched by a key 
or a mirror broken off or even a missing car." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the officials at Hollywood Park, the Forum nor the city have conducted 
a survey of visitors to determine their perceptions about Inglewood, but they 
say they don't feel they have to. Their colleagues in business associations, 
friends in other communities and people they encounter often ask them if 
Inglewood is dangerous.

INVESTIGATION SHADOWS JUDGE'S REELECTION EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not the ideal baggage to carry into an election, but Orange County 
Municipal Judge Claude E. Whitney said he will fight for his job while battling 
allegations that he routinely denied defendants their basic constitutional 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commission on Judicial Performance has been investigating Whitney, 63, 
since the Orange County public defender's office filed a 325-page complaint 
against him in January, 1993. The U. S. Commission on Civil Rights is also 
looking into the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney contends he did nothing wrong. He said he is being targeted by defense 
attorneys who oppose his tough sentences and his no-nonsense attitude on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in running an efficient courtroom and making sure everyone gets a 
fair and impartial trial," Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitney also concedes that the investigation makes him vulnerable in the 
upcoming June 7 primary election. His opponent, defense attorney Dennis Patrick 
O'Connell, has made the controversy the cornerstone of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the judge doesn't follow the rules, how can you expect the public to have 
confidence in the courts?" said O'Connell, 44. "We're talking about 
constitutional rights being violated." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint alleges it was Whitney's practice to illegally deny defendants 
bail hearings, translators and court-appointed attorneys and punish those who 
insisted on representation with another week in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented resolution, the Orange County Bar Assn. found "there was a 
systematic denial of due process" for many defendants appearing before the 
judge in one of the county's busiest misdemeanor arraignment courts. Whitney 
has since been rotated to an assignment hearing small claims cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil attorney before being appointed to the bench in May, 1989, Whitney 
said he remains confident he will be vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell decided to run for judge after his wife, Dawn, died in December 
after a sudden illness. The tragedy caused him to reflect on his future and 
helped focus his dedication to the law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he knows he faces an uphill battle trying to unseat an incumbent 
judge, especially since he has little time for round-the-clock campaigning now 
that he is the lone parent caring for three children aged 11 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel that the law is what controls our society -- as it should," he 
said. "But it is also the confidence that people have in the law that keeps 
society from running amok." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Caryl Lee and Seal Beach attorney Barry S. Brown are challenging 
Municipal Judge Dan C. Dutcher, 63, who has been on the bench 12 years and 
handles felony arraignments in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 To his supporters, Dutcher is a compassionate, fiercely independent judge who 
frequently works during the lunch hour or into the early evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire Judge Dutcher," said Don Ronaldson, head of the public defender's 
office in West Orange County Municipal Court. "His experience and independence 
demand that I know my stuff before I argue a case. He is tough to convince." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, say he does not have the proper "judicial temperament," can 
be moody and spends too much time off the bench -- leaving attorneys and 
clients cooling their heels. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, Judge Dutcher has the worst work habits of any judge in the 
county and should be replaced," said attorney Bruce C. Bridgman, who is Lee's 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher said he is the target of a smear campaign and petty politics. Since 
Lee began running for his seat, he has seen an increase in the number of 
prosecutors seeking to remove him from their cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, who prides himself on tailoring creative sentences to punish 
crimes, said his refusal to yield to attorneys provokes criticism from defense 
attorneys and prosecutors alike -- and indicates to him he is doing a fair job. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher said, however, that he is heeding requests for more structured 
workdays and has curbed lengthy lunch breaks. He also acknowledges he has harsh 
words for attorneys who are not doing their job properly -- or are trying to 
intimidate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I manage to annoy both sides equally," Dutcher said. "I'm not really 
interested in whether they (attorneys) like my rulings or not, and I'm not very 
polite to attorneys who think they can come in and bully me." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutcher's opponents both say their diverse backgrounds make them qualified for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 39, who specializes in business and civil law, knows what judging is 
like firsthand from his frequent stints as a pro tem judge in traffic and small 
claims courts. Brown's background also includes prosecution and juvenile 
defense work. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest compliments, Brown said, comes when the parties in his 
court believe they were treated fairly -- even if they lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe very strongly people need to take the blame for their conduct," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, 37, a prosecutor for the past five years, is currently assigned to the 
family support unit. She was in civil practice for three years before joining 
the Orange County district attorney's office, where she has also handled 
juvenile cases and misdemeanor trials, including domestic violence and 
drunk-driving cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts must become more mindful of the rights of victims, said Lee, whose 
campaign motto is "Nobody doesn't like Caryl Lee." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we need changes -- stricter sentencing and more efficiency," Lee 
said. "I think victims feel cheated twice -- once by the defendant, and then by 
the system." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In other races, incumbent Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles, 49, who works in 
Laguna Niguel and has been a judge for the past 11 years, is being challenged 
by Mission Viejo attorney John C. Connolly, 51, who specializes in civil 
defense and trial work. 
</P>
<P>
 Iles, who formerly worked as a deputy public defender and prosecutor before 
being appointed to the bench, is known by her colleagues as an independent 
judge who encourages rehabilitation but also cracks down on dangerous 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Iles is also known for her work on behalf of abused children and rape victims. 
She speaks around the state on ways law enforcement can better respond to such 
difficult cases. Her efforts were recognized by then-Gov. George Deukmejian, 
who presented her with a service award. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly, a former member of the board of trustees at Saddleback College, said 
his general practice background will give him greater independence to help 
streamline court operations and make them more responsive to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's time for a change," Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The only Superior Court seat up for grabs is in the Westminster Courthouse and 
is being sought by two Municipal Court judges based in Santa Ana. But the tone 
of that race is hardly adversarial. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge B. (Tam) Nomoto, 43, who is the county's only Asian American female 
judge, said she respects opponent Judge Gary P. Ryan, 50, and will not compete 
with him for judicial endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 That will come as a relief to many of the judges who have said privately they 
feel torn between the two candidates, both well respected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to let the voters know what my record is and what my 
background is -- there will be no dirt in this race," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her colleagues say Nomoto is brilliant. Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr. named her to the bench in 1979 -- at the time making her the youngest judge 
ever to be appointed in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Before being elected to the bench nearly 16 years ago, Ryan, 50, worked as a 
prosecutor, handling felony and misdemeanor cases and specializing in writs and 
appeals. Like Nomoto, Ryan said he wants to take on the challenge of the 
Superior Court bench to handle new and different cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomoto said she is also concerned about the lack of Asian Americans and women 
on both the Municipal and Superior Court benches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the influx of Asians has been a fairly recent development, and I am 
hopeful that that imbalance (on the bench) will be corrected in the future, 
particularly as more and more Asian attorneys are coming into the practice," 
she said. "I think it's important that the courts represent the face of our 
community." Judgment Time 
</P>
<P>
 Judicial candidates are running for election to four Orange County courts in 
the June 7 primary: 
</P>
<P>
 SUPERIOR COURT 
</P>
<P>
 * Central Orange County Municipal Court Judge B. (Tam) Nomoto, 43 
</P>
<P>
 * Central Orange County Municipal Court Judge Gary P. Ryan, 50 
</P>
<P>
 Both are seeking the position being vacated by Judge Robert A. Knox, who sits 
in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 CENTRAL MUNICIPAL COURT 
</P>
<P>
 * Incumbent Claude E. Whitney, 63 
</P>
<P>
 * Attorney Dennis Patrick O'Connell, 44; Anaheim and Westminster specializes 
in criminal defense 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH MUNICIPAL COURT 
</P>
<P>
 * Incumbent Pamela L. Iles, 49 
</P>
<P>
 * Mission Viejo attorney John C. Connolly, 51; general practice includes 
criminal defense and family law 
</P>
<P>
 WEST MUNICIPAL COURT 
</P>
<P>
 * Incumbent Dan C. Dutcher, 63 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutor Caryl Lee, 37; assigned to the family support unit of the Orange 
County district attorney's office

REPUBLICANS TIRE OF MINORITY STATUS IN HOUSE; POLITICS: FOR 40 YEARS, DEMOCRATS 
HAVE RUN THE SHOW. GOP MEMBERS SUCH AS ROBERT K. DORNAN OF GARDEN GROVE FIND IT 
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET BILLS PASSED AND FRUSTRATINGLY DIFFICULT TO BE HEARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sometimes when the U.S. House of Representatives is dark, when the suits have 
gone home and the C-SPAN camera is turned off for the night, Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan slips into the speaker's chair, a cushy leather number ceremoniously 
perched high above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The chair feels good. The congressman feels bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fantasize," the veteran Garden Grove lawmaker says wistfully. "Not of being 
the Speaker of the House, just of being a member of the majority party." 
</P>
<P>
 He dreams of a day when there might be more of him than them, more Republicans 
than Democrats, more conservatives than liberals. Of an end to the tyranny (his 
word) of a party that hates his right-wing guts. 
</P>
<P>
 For 40 years, the lower house of Congress has been dominated by Democrats, an 
vexing legacy for the 176 Republicans -- six who represent Orange County -- 
relegated to the heap dubbed "minority members." 
</P>
<P>
 This is about more than losing almost every time there's a vote. Republicans 
rarely get invited to the White House. They never take home the brass-plated 
souvenir gavel that tells the world "I presided over the U.S. House of 
Representatives." They are never allowed to sit in the Speaker's chair, not 
while the House is in session, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 For awhile, the most powerful Republican members of the House's various 
committees started calling themselves "vice chairmen." The Democrats passed a 
rule busting them down to "ranking member." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a world where Democrats make all the rules, decide which bills come to 
the floor and what gets debated. If a Republican has an idea for a bill, the 
Democrats may well ignore it. "If they like it, they steal it and put their 
name on it," one aide grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 They are always outnumbered, always outgunned, always out-staffed. The only 
saving grace is that, had the tables turned four decades ago, the Republicans 
would have done the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," concedes Rep. Christopher Cox, a three-term Newport Beach 
congressman who was a toddler in diapers the last time his party ruled the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some say that when the Republicans were in charge, they were even 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm told they fired all the staffs. I'm told they were really tyrannical," 
said Rep. Don Edwards of San Jose, chairman of the California Democratic 
Congressional Delegation. And why shouldn't the Democrats prevail? They win 
more elections. But even Edwards acknowledges that, in some cases, the 
imbalance of power has gone a little far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their points are well-taken," Edwards said. "But somebody has to run the 
House." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't start out this way. The powerful Rules Committee, which decides 
whether amendments to a pending bill can be discussed, has grown tougher over 
time. In 1977, it restricted amendments on only 15% of all bills. By last 
month, it was restricting them on 80% of all bills, severely crippling the 
opposition to most laws in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 This more than anything steams the Republicans, who say they can deal with 
defeat. What they cannot abide is never getting heard in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get to decide which bills come to the floor, which witnesses come 
to the hearing, what the hearing topic is or the direction of the questions. 
And you don't get to decide what amendments can be offered to the bills that 
are brought to the floor," said Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House's 
second-ranking Republican. "You are a team perpetually playing defense. Every 
once in a while you intercept the ball and score a touchdown. About every six 
or eight weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what Washington does it does in committees, and the committees are 
shored up by thousands of staff -- lawyers, secretaries, researchers, experts 
-- there to educate members of Congress so they might debate intelligently. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to staff, the Democrats always have more. On the subcommittee on 
crime and criminal justice, for example, the Republicans have Andrew Cowin, the 
staff counsel; Cowin has one secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats have five lawyers and three or four other staff assistants," an 
exasperated Cowin recently said. "I have me and Audray (the secretary), and I 
share her with another lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this can prove somewhat embarrassing at election time because 
Republicans rarely get bills through. Dornan, for example, seems forever 
haunted by the fact that in his years in Congress he has never passed a bill, 
unless you count his resolution paying tribute to Walt Disney several years 
after Disney died. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, a glass case of miniature Mickey Mouses and other Disney figurines 
gracing his outer office, bristles at this charge. "The liberal hatchet men 
say, 'This is all he has gotten through.' That's a big lie. Gerry Ford was here 
25 years and he never had a bill with his name on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the legislative session last year, there were only two bills where 
Republican votes meant the difference between victory and defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally, they matter," one veteran Washington reporter said. "But most 
of the time they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The minority members measure victory in other ways -- in amendments rolled 
into Democrat-sponsored legislation -- ("And I've had more of those than anyone 
of my tenure," Dornan says) -- or leverage asserted at opportune moments. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Democrats needed Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's cooperation in some obscure 
procedural matter that threatened to keep President Clinton from going to 
Moscow, the Huntington Beach Republican agreed to cooperate if the Democrats 
would let him pay homage to everyone who died fighting communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton went to Russia; Rohrabacher is getting a monument. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without that, I never would have even come close," the congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hurdles, the Republicans seem to get plenty done. Rohrabacher says 
it was his public crusade in Los Angeles that led Congress to deny quake aid to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, had Dornan known it would be like this, he might have thought again 
when he entered the congressional freshman class of 1976, so charged up with 
bicentennial fever he hardly noticed the Republicans had lost the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you what hurts," Dornan said mournfully, a Diet Pepsi in one 
hand. "It's the little things -- here comes a freshman I never laid eyes on 
before and all of a sudden I look up and he's in the speaker's chair. I am 
seeing people with half my time in Congress chairing subcommittees that I serve 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so frustrating. If I had known that for the next 18 years it was going 
to be like this, I wouldn't have come to Congress."

SCOUTING OUT THE RANCH; TROOPS GET FIRST TASTE OF 188-ACRE SITE THAT A LOT OF 
THIN MINTS HELPED PAY FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Call it the ranch that a drug lord built and cookies bought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Girl Scout Council of Orange County opened its sprawling Rancho del Rio 
for the first time Saturday and celebrated in typical Scout fashion. Young 
girls hiked, picnicked and explored the rambling hacienda, log cabins and 
intricate stone cottages that are scattered across the 188-acre enclave tucked 
in a narrow canyon of live oaks and sycamores, east of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 About 55 local Girl Scouts and their leaders spent opening day on the ranch 
bought from the county three years ago for $2.38 million -- all of the money 
coming from cookie sales. Scout leaders raved about the ranch, not only for its 
colorful history, but for the unique opportunity it affords them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Standing here, it's hard to believe San Juan Capistrano and the boats in Dana 
Point Harbor are only about 10 miles away," said Harriet Ottaviano of Seal 
Beach, the Scout council's assistant program director. "That's what's wonderful 
about this ranch. It's close, but when you're here you feel like you're far 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders joked about their new campsite's past as a hide-out and marijuana 
warehouse for drug kingpin Daniel James Fowlie, who was convicted of drug 
smuggling charges in 1991, six years after narcotics agents seized his beloved 
ranch. A federal judge fined Fowlie $1 million and sent him to prison for 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "His misfortune was our good luck," said Lorel Roehl, 34, of Irvine, the 
director of outdoor programs for the local council, which governs 23,000 Scouts 
in the county. "We had been looking for a place like this for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowlie lost his ranch in an odd chain of events that started at 2 a.m. on a 
February morning in 1985 and ended with the smuggler's downfall. On that night, 
the ranch foreman snapped in Laguna Beach after a binge of drug abuse and began 
shooting a gun into the early morning darkness, bringing on the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies found $73,000 in cash and a 50-pound bale of 
marijuana in the Laguna home where the foreman was staying, and a subsequent 
investigation led deputies to the remote ranch on a winding dirt road through 
Verdugo Canyon, just off Ortega Highway near Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates controlled the ranch for six years and promoted it as a 
site for a regional drug-enforcement training center. In 1989, President George 
Bush visited Rancho Del Rio and gave a major drug speech that was televised 
nationally. During the visit, the President endorsed plans for a training 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Orange County Board of Supervisors eventually balked at the sheriff's 
proposal and put Rancho Del Rio up to bid. The Girl Scouts won the ranch over 
Hanu Reddy Realty of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, we are a perfect owner for a place like this because we are going to 
respect the land and the animals around here," Roehl said. "It offers us a 
chance to educate our girls about the environment. We have things like the 
gnatcatcher up here, which is something they can't find in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Before they bought the ranch, the county's Girl Scouts relied on the 700-acre 
Camp Scherman near Idyllwild for outdoor activities. But now they have a site 
much more conducive to day camps, said Diane Smith, a Scout spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very fortunate. You just aren't going to find 188 acres in Orange 
County nowadays," Smith said. "This is just a short drive away from most of our 
troops." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has spent the past three years obtaining county permits needed to 
bring Scouts to the ranch. The grounds have been weeded and spruced up with 
flowers, but little has been done to the ornate structures.  
</P>
<P>
 "We still need to make some difficult decisions about which of these buildings 
we want to make earthquake-proof," said Roehl, adding that none were built to 
code or with proper permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch has a wealth of amenities: a wine cellar, a former casino, four 
wells, horse stables, a rock barbecue, dog kennels, a vineyard and fruit 
orchards, and several cabins that can serve as home sites. There's also a 
warehouse that could be converted to a gymnasium for volleyball and basketball, 
and plenty of space for horseback riding, archery, backpacking and educational 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nedy Garcia, 17, said the ranch is perfect for camping because it is an 
unspoiled area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more primitive than our other campgrounds," said Garcia, a junior at 
Santa Ana Valley High School. "There are no bathrooms or things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Christina Rasch of Huntington Beach made the trip to the ranch 
with her fellow Scouts from Troop 90. They spent the morning hiking along the 
dirt paths that veer out from the flat valley floor, looking for wildlife and 
listening as their guides explained the flora and fauna of the unspoiled county 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like the animals the best. They remind me of my guinea pig at home," 
said the smiling Rasch, a sixth-grader at Carden Academy in Huntington Beach. 
Next weekend, the Scouts will have the first overnight camp out at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been getting harder and harder to find a place for our Scouts," Roehl 
said. "The parks and campgrounds around here are constantly getting more 
crowded and more expensive. That's why this ranch is so great for us."

SEISMIC HAZARDS MAY FORCE CAL STATE OUT OF LONG BEACH OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State University officials say that they may have to abandon the system's 
oceanfront headquarters in Long Beach, in part because a consultant has warned 
that the administrative building is a significant seismic hazard requiring 
nearly $700,000 in immediate repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant, Jim Hill & Associates of Signal Hill, also said it would cost 
at least $5 million to stabilize the land underneath the university's 
conference center and the southern portion of the headquarters, where an 
earthquake could trigger liquefaction of soils as deep as 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 CSU Executive Vice Chancellor Molly Broad said university officials have 
already been informally looking for other office space in downtown Long Beach 
and expect to sign a contract soon with a broker to conduct a formal search and 
study whether moving the headquarters would be economically viable. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad and Lori Erdman, her executive assistant, said earthquake concerns are 
only part of the problems with the headquarters on Golden Shore. 
</P>
<P>
 They said a related study showed that walls and corridors of the 
97,000-square-foot structure would have to be torn out and the mechanical and 
electrical systems would have to be updated to consolidate work space and make 
way for the installation of more computers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, CSU may have to build a 60,000-square-foot addition on the site 
if officials implement a plan to move the system's construction section and 
computer center closer to top administrators. Currently, those sections are 
housed in space rented in a federal building in Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 About 225 employees work at the headquarters, built for $5.5 million in 1975 
to lure the university administration out of its Downtown Los Angeles offices. 
It is owned by a building authority formed under a joint powers agreement 
between the city of Long Beach and CSU. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions about the building's seismic safety were raised in a report 
given to CSU officials shortly before the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. The 
report concluded that the Long Beach building "in its current configuration 
represents a significant seismic hazard. Immediate steps should be taken to 
either retrofit the building or to terminate occupancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Broad said headquarters employees were notified about those conclusions the 
day after the Northridge temblor. The university has since ordered a detailed 
cost estimate of the repairs, which could be paid for out of budget reserves 
and would include adding shear walls and more anchors between walls and floors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we take care of those structural issues, we will be able to get people out 
of the building. But the building would be damaged," Erdman said. "If we don't 
do that, we won't be able to take care of our employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Both officials said CSU would probably make a decision on whether to move in 
August, when it meets with the building authority.

MTA PLAN TO INCREASE BUS FARES DRAWS FIRE; TRANSIT: SPEAKERS BERATE OFFICIALS 
FOR SEEKING TO RAISE COSTS AND CUT SERVICES. AGENCY IS SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO 
MEET A PROJECTED $126-MILLION DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials asked members of the public 
Saturday if they would like their bus fares hiked and their services cut.  
</P>
<P>
 Their answer: No, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 Except no one said thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 A raucous standing-room-only crowd of bus riders and their advocates jammed 
the county Board of Supervisors hearing room as speaker after speaker berated 
MTA officials for proposals to increase bus fares and cut service to meet a 
projected $126-million deficit in the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers were seldom shy or subtle in lodging their protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increased fares could result in violence in the streets," warned one speaker, 
Patricia Price. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is expected to make decisions before July 1 on a raft of proposals 
that could affect service for all bus riders, including those who get special 
rates, such as the elderly, the disabled and students. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials tried to make the bitter pills more palatable by pointing out 
that the current $1.10 bus fare was set six years ago and has not been 
increased despite inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other major transit operation in the country can say that," said Judith A. 
Wilson, executive officer for planning and programming. 
</P>
<P>
 When the cost of living increases, Wilson said, "So too do the costs of 
transportation go up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pay checks didn't go up," shouted a member of the audience.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the MTA's many proposals under consideration are increasing fares across 
the board, hiking fares only during peak travel times, charging the elderly and 
disabled passengers a 25-cent co-payment during peak travel times, limiting 
student passes to 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., canceling holiday, weekend and late-night 
bus service and canceling or reducing service on many bus lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians opposed to the MTA proposals were followed to the speakers podium 
by senior citizens, the disabled, blue-collar workers, minimum-wage earners and 
at least one teacher and a high school student, all of whom argued that fare 
increases and service cuts would seriously hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA Chairman Richard Alatorre was shouted down and jeered as he tried to 
prevent the crowd from applauding orations and attempted to limit each speaker 
to three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Alatorre tried to placate the audience by expressing sympathy 
with the bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "In fairness," he said, "I think we need to keep in mind that our transit 
system must be available to those who need it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Time!" shouted members of the audience. "Your time is up." 
</P>
<P>
 Several speakers, including Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, accused the MTA of 
disproportionately subsidizing rail systems while shortchanging bus riders. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA figures indicate that fares provide 43% of the overall cost of operating 
its bus system, with the remainder coming from government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldberg insisted that the MTA gives the Blue Line light-rail system seven 
times the subsidy given to some bus lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg pointed out to MTA board members that the City Council passed a 
resolution Friday that not only opposes bus fare increases or service cuts, but 
urges that current fares be cut to 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Baugh, a teacher at Manual Arts High School, warned the board that if it 
increases bus fares for students, "You will increase the already devastating 
dropout rate at Manual Arts." 
</P>
<P>
 David Soto, a student at Manual Arts and the son of a single mother who is 
struggling to make ends meet, told the MTA that he would not be able to afford 
to ride the bus to school if the fare is raised. 
</P>

 Several advocates for the blind and disabled warned the MTA that cuts in 
service could leave such bus riders prisoners in their homes.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that it would be quite a hardship for . . . all those who ride the bus 
if the services are cut," said Albert Contreras, who is blind and a member of 
the California Council of the Blind.

 Avice Wiseman, an elderly woman who represents several senior citizen

IN GIFTS BIG AND SMALL, QUAKE AID GIVES L.A. A LIFT

 Susan Dunn, a Long Beach nurse-practitioner, turned a portion of the $10,000 
"shopping spree" prize she won at a department store into gift certificates for 
50 families who were victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at a Pennsylvania middle school raised $440 by selling peanut butter 
Easter eggs and donated it to a single mother with seven children in Canoga 
Park whose apartment was destroyed in the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 From near and far, individuals and corporations have donated more than $43 
million in cash and many millions more in goods and services to earthquake 
victims through major nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles, including the Red 
Cross, United Way, Salvation Army, World Vision and Catholic Charities of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Faced with urgent and critical emergency needs, the American nation responded 
in an absolutely magnificent fashion," said Russell Prince, executive director 
of the Salvation Army's Southern California Division. 
</P>
<P>
 As of mid-April, the Salvation Army had received $7.4 million, the Red Cross 
$32 million, United Way $1.2 million, Catholic Charities of Los Angeles $1.5 
million and World Vision $455,000 for quake relief. In addition, the Los 
Angeles Earthquake Relief Fund, established by the mayor's office to handle 
donations in the immediate aftermath of the quake, received $964,400, according 
to press secretary Noelia Rodriguez. She said the donations were made to be 
used by specific city agencies, including the Police Department, Fire 
Department and Public Library. Ten percent of the money has been earmarked for 
community-based organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 130 Japanese businesses, government organizations and individuals 
also teamed up to donate $3.1 million in cash, services and products, including 
2,750 bowls of beef donburi -- sauteed beef and onions over rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Although large donations of money, food, clothing, water and bedding enabled 
relief workers to handle tens of thousands of people who needed help 
immediately after the quake, it was the small gifts, such as those from the 
students in Pennsylvania and Susan Dunn, that added personal touches to the 
support shown to quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn's gift was "one of the most unique," said Mike Tomasello, director of 
development for Catholic Charities of Los Angeles. "That gift was divided into 
something very special," because 50 families from Los Angeles, Santa Monica and 
the San Fernando Valley each received a $50 Broadway department store gift 
certificate with which to buy whatever they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dunn first got the word that she had won the prize, she didn't believe 
it. "I didn't look at the letter for three days -- I had never won anything in 
my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when she saw that it was for real, she chose to share her luck. She 
gave $500 to her employer, Mullikin Medical Centers, which was also raising 
money for earthquake relief, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Marietta, Pa., a town of 2,700, about 100 students -- more than half of 
them boys -- spent four days making 600 peanut butter eggs to raise the $440, 
said Jean Gerdes, a home economics teacher at Donegar Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year around Easter, her students make peanut butter Easter eggs and 
donate the proceeds to a worthy cause. Last year, the money went to a Donegar 
student who was ill. This year, sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders at Donegar 
voted overwhelmingly to send the money to Los Angeles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned recently that the money was going to a single mother with seven 
children in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel very good about it," Gerdes said. "What we raised wasn't significant 
enough to give to the Red Cross, but we thought if (we) could find one family, 
the money would help." 
</P>
<P>
 "The gift from the students is being used to pay for the family's housing," 
Tomasello said. "It was a very special gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three months after the quake left 57 people dead, caused losses 
estimated at up to $20 billion, and left thousands of people homeless, 
donations continue to come in to nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although well-established organizations are receiving the money and in-kind 
donations, small community-based groups say they have to struggle for funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to convince donators to give to organizations like ours because we 
are not well-known like the Salvation Army and United Way," said Oscar Andrade, 
executive director of El Rescate, which serves 600 families from its offices in 
the Pico-Union area. "Our food reserves is down to zero," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross, which has already spent $19.2 million on earthquake relief, 
must raise an additional $5 million to reach its target of $37 million. The 
amount of money the Red Cross has raised thus far for the Northridge quake is 
$22 million less than the $54 million collected after the 1989 Loma Prieta 
quake in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Most relief organizations are now looking to long-range programs to help quake 
victims who need housing, jobs and psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long after the story of the earthquake is faded from TV news screens and 
newspaper front pages, long after the freeways have been repaired and buildings 
have been fixed, there will still be broken lives which need help, support and 
a perspective which sees beyond tragedy to triumph," said Col. George Church, 
division commander for the Salvation Army.

COLORADO SEIZES TRUST AFFILIATE OF 1ST PENSION; INVESTING: ACTION IS TAKEN 
AFTER $10 MILLION IS REPORTED WITHDRAWN. FIRM'S PRINCIPAL, WILLIAM E. COOPER, 
HAD BUSINESS TIES WITH EX-SEN. JOHN SEYMOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a hilly section of this affluent town, William E. Cooper bought a 
3,400-square-foot house in a gated community by raising money the same way he 
did in business. He got it from investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who helped by lending him money were eventually paid back. But 8,000 
investors are wondering if they will recoup $350 million they put into the 
labyrinth of companies under Cooper's First Diversified Financial Services in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's First Pension Corp., the administrator for the investments, went 
bankrupt Friday. His Summit Trust Co. in Englewood, Colo., which acted as the 
trustee for investment proceeds, was seized Thursday by state authorities there 
after Summit's president reported that First Pension, without authorization, 
withdrew $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, who was a financial backer of former U.S. Sen. John Seymour and bought 
80% of Seymour's real estate company in 1981, would not comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Milan Smith, said Cooper will be working "to help investors find 
out what happened to their money." All records are intact, he said, and the FBI 
has the Irvine headquarters under surveillance to make sure no records are 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he did know whether the allegation that $10 million was diverted 
from Summit Trust is true. He likened the problems at Cooper's companies to the 
kinds of loan problems that have faced banks and savings and loans. Some loans 
simply went bad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's three-bedroom house in Villa Park is for sale. The assessed value of 
the brown Tudor-style house, built in 1979 in the upscale Somerset 
neighborhood, is $732,238, according to Orange County property records. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper bought the house at least in part with personal loans, including 
$20,000 from Thomas and Barbara Vennum of Huntington Beach. The Vennums also 
invested in a number of second and third trust deeds through Cooper's company, 
then called Continental Home Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Second trust deeds are generally risky because they are mortgages that stand 
behind first trust deeds in the event of foreclosure. The Vennums were 
eventually repaid on the loan for Cooper's house. So when a $26,000 investment 
on a Simi Valley property in the early 1980s went awry, Vennum said, Cooper 
promised that the funds would be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going to pay us back at a certain rate of interest, but he never got 
around to doing that," Vennum said. The couple sued in 1990 when interest had 
raised the total amount owed to $60,000. Cooper eventually settled by paying 
$22,500, Vennum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out Cooper's various corporate names, Vennum said, "Every time I got 
a paper from this guy, it was on different letterhead." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other corporate names Cooper used were Continental Commercial Financial, 
Diversified Financial Services, First Diversified Asset Management, Equity 
Realty Advisors and Vestcorp. Equity Realty and Vestcorp recently moved from 
Orange to Irvine with the parent company, First Diversified Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension in Irvine, with about 40 employees, closed its doors Thursday, 
though a dozen workers will try to keep the company operating while a buyer is 
sought, said the company's bankruptcy lawyer, William M. Burd of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in Cooper's various companies say that promised payments of interest 
and principal were often slow in arriving and that a number of investment funds 
never closed, meaning that repayments of principal continued to be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been in a fund that closed," said Ralph Breen, a Los Angeles 
resident who began investing with Cooper in 1982 and was supposed to be repaid 
on his first investment two years ago. Breen said he is still waiting to get 
all of his money. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also was slow in paying the $720,000 purchase price for the majority 
stake in Seymour's Anaheim real estate firm in 1981, court records show. 
Seymour, then Anaheim's mayor, wanted to concentrate more on his political 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper paid $50,000 down and agreed to pay another $670,000 plus interest over 
time, according to court records. But the company faltered, and Cooper made 
only a few payments. Seymour, who had become a state senator by then, sued and 
agreed to settle with Cooper in 1988 for $100,000. It was unclear whether any 
money was turned over. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, one of Seymour's aides twice intervened with state 
regulators in matters involving Cooper, once to help get Cooper's real estate 
license reinstated after it had been revoked by the state and later to urge the 
state real estate department to investigate Cooper's company. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his defeat in the 1992 Senate election, Seymour has become executive 
director of the California Housing Finance Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Before their apparent falling out, Cooper's conservative credentials and close 
ties to Seymour helped him win appointment by former Gov. George Deukmejian in 
1984 to the board of the California Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit 
agency studying the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In promotional material he sent to investors in 1990, Cooper also said he was 
chairman of the board of trustees for the Medical Center of Garden Grove and 
was a fund-raiser for the Orangewood Children's Home and the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, investigations into Cooper's operations here and in Colorado have 
begun, and investors will likely have to wait awhile before they receive their 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that I have the ability to freeze accounts, I have stopped the 
bleeding at Summit," Andrew Snyder, a Denver lawyer appointed to liquidate 
Summit Trust, said Saturday. "Our biggest problem now is tapping into records 
that are tied up in computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Some limited partnerships, he said, haven't paid a cent in years. Payments 
will resume once he can determine how much money is available, he said, and how 
much is owed to each of about 8,000 Southern California investors, most of whom 
bought into Cooper's pools of mortgage securities. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Summit is 95% owned by Cooper, Valerie Jensen and Robert E. Lindley. 
Jensen and Lindley are both longtime aides of Cooper's and top executives in 
his various companies. He said Summit's president, Kenneth Lyon, told Colorado 
banking regulators that unauthorized transfers totaling $10 million from Summit 
accounts were made by First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said he has asked federal authorities to investigate Summit's collapse. 
Irvine Police Sgt. Dwight Henninger said his department is looking into the 
activities of Cooper and First Pension and that he has called the FBI for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. 
attorney's office in Los Angeles acknowledged that they are monitoring 
developments.

TB CASES RISE DRAMATICALLY IN COUNTY, STATE; PUBLIC HEALTH: NUMBER WHO GET THE 
DISEASE INCREASED 71% IN O.C. SINCE 1990. OFFICIALS WILL SEEK $1.5 MILLION TOP 
OPEN NEW CLINICS AND START SKIN TESTING OF ALL NEW STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with the increased danger of tuberculosis, public health officials plan 
to begin skin testing this fall of all first-time students to Orange County 
schools, from first grade through high school. 
</P>
<P>
 They intend to open tuberculosis clinics across the county and more closely 
monitor the treatment of people who are infected to make sure they take their 
medication so they will get well and not be contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 This comprehensive strategy is expensive. On Tuesday, the Orange County Health 
Care Agency will ask the Board of Supervisors for $1.5 million in additional 
money to hire 33 more health workers they can deploy in schools, clinics and 
jails to fight the disease, which has shown a 71% increase in new cases in 
Orange County since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The new resources would substantially bolster the county's current 
anti-tuberculosis program, which consists of a $5-million annual budget and a 
70-person staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the health agency is jumping ahead of the ordinary county budget 
process to ask for a mid-year increase in funding, no opposition is expected 
from the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is money well spent," said Supervisor William G. Steiner. "I think 
public health needs to be a high priority and preventive efforts are really 
cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said board members were alarmed by the outbreak last year of 
drug-resistant tuberculosis at Westminster's La Quinta High School, where 12 
students were diagnosed with active disease linked to a 16-year-old girl. One 
of the students, who suffered a severe relapse, now faces the prospect of 
surgery to remove part of her lung. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding such a public health threat, which often is associated with 
overcrowded housing and poverty, is a wake-up call for Orange County, Steiner 
said. "I think sometimes Orange County thinks it is immune from these kind of 
difficulties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Weismuller, the county's manager of disease control, said county 
officials could not wait for the regular budget process, which usually does not 
allow new hiring by county departments to begin until October. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need additional staff to handle the increased demand and we need it now, 
not in six months," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials say they want more personnel to more aggressively 
treat active, contagious cases of TB throughout the community. There has been a 
sharp increase in active TB in Orange County, up from 258 newly diagnosed cases 
in 1990 to 440 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Another disturbing statistic, Weismuller said, is that only 76% of people put 
on treatment for active tuberculosis in the county complete their medication 
regimen, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sets a goal of 
95%. "We want to try to close that gap," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kenneth Castro, director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's division of TB elimination, said Orange County is among many local 
health-care agencies nationwide that were caught off guard by the resurgence of 
tuberculosis, which most health experts until the mid-1980s believed was on the 
brink of eradication.  
</P>
<P>
 The recurrence of TB has been linked to increased immigration from countries 
such as Vietnam and Mexico where the disease is endemic and to the concurrent 
growth of the AIDS epidemic, whose victims are susceptible to TB. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing the rise in TB will be a long-term battle, Weismuller said, that 
will require giving preventive treatment to the many people who have been 
exposed to the disease and thus have the bacteria in their system that could 
become active later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 In the area of prevention, Weismuller said, the county's highest priority is 
to reach children through the school-screening program to begin next fall. She 
estimated that 19,000 student newcomers will need TB skin tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The county may get some some help in the testing from private physicians or 
school nurses. But she said county health-care workers are expected to bear 
most of the burden of follow-up care of students who are found to be infected. 
Weismuller estimated that 1,400 youngsters will be discovered with inactive 
tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the exposed children, she said, will be referred to the county Health 
Care Agency for six months of medication that will greatly reduce the 
probability that they will develop active tuberculosis later in life. Two of 
the new nursing positions that health agency is requesting, she said, will be 
dedicated to this task. In addition, Weismuller said, the Health Care Agency 
wants to hire six more nurses to provide preventive treatment to an estimated 
1,700 people a year who have been told they have inactive TB, but have given up 
on trying to get care at the county's overcrowded clinic in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last three years, the clinic has operated at full capacity," 
Weismuller said, and hasn't been able to take more patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides adding nurses to the tuberculosis clinic on 1725 W. 17th Street, she 
said, newly hired nurses would open satellite TB clinics in other parts of the 
county that would be more convenient for people requiring preventive 
medication. Also the requested funds, she said, would enable the county to hire 
bilingual and bicultural community workers to work with the nurses at the new 
treatment sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important than prevention, Weismuller said, is to ensure that Orange 
County residents with active disease are properly treated and monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 33 new positions the health agency is requesting, 10 would be dedicated 
primarily to treating people already infected with active tuberculosis, which 
can be spread to others through coughing. 
</P>
<P>
 The TB outbreak at La Quinta was sparked by the delayed diagnosis and 
inadequate treatment of a student who was contagious for more than two years, 
according to a federal investigation of the episode. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us wants to live through another outbreak," Weismuller said. To avoid 
that prospect, she said, the Health Care Agency is asking for another treating 
physician at the county TB clinic and four more public health nurses, for a 
total of 12, who will act as "case managers," following patients with active TB 
to make certain they obtain adequate diagnosis and therapy, even if they are 
under the care of private physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller noted that a new state law gives county health officials authority 
to review the TB treatment plans of private physicians and requires physicians 
to transfer to county care those patients who are not compliant. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most worrisome problems in tuberculosis control, Weismuller said, 
is that patients infected with active tuberculosis tend to stop taking their 
medicine when they begin to feel better and they get tired of the daily 
treatment, which lasts a year. But when they stop taking the drugs, the disease 
can come back in a more virulent and drug-resistant form. 
</P>
<P>
 To make certain that patients stay on their medicine, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention recommends that health authorities "observe" them. But 
Weismuller said because of a staffing shortage, the county provided "observed 
therapy" only for the most serious cases until last summer, emergency federal 
funds were used to hire four community workers and began witnessing the 
treatment of 126 patients, or 28% of its active TB caseload. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get three more outreach workers, as requested, we are going to have 40% 
of patients on directly observed therapy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, county health officials said they want to focus more attention on 
curbing tuberculosis in Orange County's jails, an environment that can easily 
allow the spread of contagious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the county's public health officer, said he wants to 
assign four new nursing assistants to the jail medical services "so we can 
screen everyone within 24 hours of coming into the jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a shortage of medical staff, jail inmates are screened for TB only 
after they have been incarcerated seven days, according to Dr. Ernest Williams, 
the county's director for correctional medical services.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
PACKARD RELUCTANTLY CALLS FOR THE CLOSURE OF SAN ONOFRE CHECKPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Close it: A frustrated Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), for years a fervent 
advocate of a remodeled, modernized border checkpoint south of San Clemente, 
has reluctantly backed off that position and called on Congress and immigration 
officials to close it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard blamed his new stance on the Clinton Administration, which he said 
appears to have disbanded the proposed $30-million upgrade of the San Onofre 
checkpoint on Interstate 5. After meeting last Wednesday with Immigration and 
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner, Packard issued a statement 
urging officials to close two checkpoints (the other is in Temecula) and shift 
all the resources and agents to the "first line of defense" at the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been an advocate of the checkpoints in the past, operating under the 
assumption that the expansion at San Clemente would take place," Packard said. 
"But I am concerned that the Clinton Administration has no intention of 
expanding the checkpoint at San Clemente." 
</P>
<P>
 Packard said the checkpoint "is useless unless it is open 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week." Because of budget constraints, the checkpoint is now shut 
down intermittently. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner said the INS is re-evaluating its entire enforcement policy and that 
because the border will receive first priority, the closing of the checkpoints 
is a possibility. The San Onofre checkpoint is about 50 miles north of the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New faces: Anyone who still doubts that 1994 will be a year of dramatic 
political change in Orange County might consider the powerful Orange County 
Transportation Authority. The composition of the 11-member OCTA board, one of 
top 10 most powerful transportation agencies in the country with a $624-million 
annual budget, will change radically. At least six members are scheduled to 
move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those set to step down are Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer of San Juan 
Capistrano, Mayor Daniel H. Young of Santa Ana, Councilman Irv Pickler of 
Anaheim, Councilman Robert P. Wahlstrom of Los Alamitos and retiring County 
Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more: Charles V. Smith of Westminster is facing a recall and William 
D. Mahoney of La Habra is still undecided about another council stint. And 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who is expected to be the next chairman of the 
Board of Supervisors, would be forced to become an OCTA alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question there will be a whole new majority on the board," 
Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney anyone?: Where did they all go? 
</P>
<P>
 Away from politics, judging by the lack of candidates who list "attorney" as 
an occupation these days. Some political experts say attorneys become 
"small-business owners" at election time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been told the one thing you studiously want to avoid is being 
designated on a ballot as an attorney," said Howard Klein, an Irvine patent 
attorney and conservative politico who is running for a seat on the Republican 
Central Committee. "This is why you see people who are attorneys claiming they 
are small businessmen. I guess the theory is that if you are a practitioner of 
law you are a small businessman." 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps a litigator, as conservative Republican Tom Reinecke of Newport 
Beach describes himself. Reinecke is locked in a heated battle with Irvine 
Councilman Barry J. Hammond for the Republican nomination in the 70th Assembly 
District, which is being vacated by incumbent Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 Klein happens to be a major backer of Hammond, who lists himself as a 
mediator, which is similar to an arbitrator but not an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein does not take this advice himself, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's right, from my own personal perspective: When you hand out 
your business card it says 'attorney at law,' " he said. "Unfortunately, there 
is no way for the registrar of voters to check these things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Klein has run twice for the central committee and--as an 
attorney--lost both times. UPCOMING EVENTS

 Aside from Democrat Tom Umberg, Orange County's state lawmakers are a 
decidedly anti-labor bunch. A recent California Federation of Labor survey of 
more than two dozen key labor bills showed that most consistently voted against 
organized labor. John R. Lewis received the lowest score in the Senate. A look 
at how often they sided with organized labor: 03,32,06,06 Assembly 1992 1993

MAN SHOT IN LEG AT SOUTH COAST PLAZA; MOTIVE UNKNOWN; VIOLENCE: YOUTH FIRED TWO 
ROUNDS BEFORE FLEEING. EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD GARDEN GROVE MAN SAYS ATTACKER ASKED 
HIM ABOUT HIS CAR BEFORE PULLING A GUN IN PARKING LOT.

<P>
 A Garden Grove man was shot in the leg Saturday afternoon in a parking lot at 
South Coast Plaza, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 John Robert Ferguson, 18, was taken to Hoag Hospital for treatment and later 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa police said Ferguson had parked his car on the eastern edge of the 
South Coast Plaza complex near the white pedestrian bridge and was walking 
toward Sears with a 17-year-old friend about 2:30 p.m. when they were 
confronted by a youth they did not know. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a witness, the youth asked the pair about their car, pulled out a 
gun and shot Ferguson in the leg. Investigators said they were unsure of the 
motive for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson and his friend ran toward the mall, zigzagging through the parking 
lot and ducking behind cars, Sgt. Tom Curtis said. The gunman shot at least 
once more, and police said officers found the spent round about 100 yards away 
on the brick tiles in front of Birraporetti's, an Italian restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant then ran east to Bristol Street and jumped into a 1980s gold, 
four-door Oldsmobile Cutlass with oversized tires driven off by a woman, Curtis 
said. There were no arrests and police said the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Spots of blood marked a trail that Ferguson took as he hopped to the mall's 
sidewalk. He finally collapsed between Sears and Birraporetti's, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two young men had gone to the mall to shop for shoes because one of them 
had just gotten a new job, according a man who heard the shooting and said he 
spoke with Ferguson's friend afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 The man said he had seen the assailant talking with the two friends, but 
didn't realize anything was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the guys were just kids who were messing around," said Kevin, 28, a 
Costa Mesa man who did not want his last name used. "I heard what sounded like 
two M-80s -- they didn't sound like gunshots." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin said he often goes by the mall, and went there Saturday to shop for 
clothes after taking in a horror movie. "You're not safe, no matter where you 
go these days," Kevin said.  
</P>
<P>
 "All I can do is say a little prayer every day," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday afternoon, police officers questioned Ferguson's 17-year-old friend, 
who was still shaking his head in disbelief at the shooting as he clutched a 
black San Francisco Giants cap and sat cross-legged atop a concrete bollard.  
</P>
<P>
 Officers then drove the teen-ager to Hoag to visit Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shoppers were surprised that South Coast Plaza was the stage for a 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very posh area," said Dante Ocotorena, 29, of Anaheim Hills, who 
visited the mall to shop for his baby daughter, Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Juli Ocotorena, 25, said she did not find it very hard to believe, 
because many youths congregate at malls.  
</P>
<P>
 "This made me look around and think about the people around us," Juli 
Ocotorena said, tucking her tiny, 13-day-old daughter into the couple's car.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many dirt bags around these days," she said.

CITY SUES BUDDHIST TEMPLE FOR VIOLATING ZONING RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ and BERT ELJERA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Atty. John Shaw filed a lawsuit last week against a Buddhist temple that 
officials claim has been operating illegally in a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that the temple -- known as Bat Nha Meditation Institute 
at 12362 West St. -- is a "public nuisance" and violates city zoning codes 
because "the large assemblages of people, the music, the noise and the traffic 
interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of the property of the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the lawsuit, filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court, were 
temple officials the Rev. Thich Nguyen Tri and Que Dinh Pham. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple officials could not be reached for comment this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit said the city first "brought this illegal use" to the attention of 
temple officials in October. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of prosecuting temple officials, the city allowed them to apply 
for a conditional-use permit so that they could continue to use the site as a 
meditation center, the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple officials never completed the required papers seeking permission, 
according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our principal concern is for the temple to stop operation immediately," Shaw 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Leyes that "we don't like to take religious institutions to 
court. But if they're not willing to comply with our codes, then really they 
leave us with no option." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyes said that the city is not trying to regulate religious practices but 
simply wants to control land uses, particularly in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are safety issues (involved) like fire codes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City codes require a minimum of one acre for a religious building. The Bat Nha 
Meditation Institute does not meet that requirement, Leyes said.

WORKSHOP TO FOCUS ON PLACES WHERE DOGS CAN ROAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents are invited to attend a workshop Monday to help develop 
recommendations on roaming areas for dogs.  
</P>
<P>
 The workshop is in response to concerns by Mayor Ann Christoph, who suggested 
in February that the city consider banning dogs from small parks and play 
areas.Christoph said she was concerned about dogs relieving themselves in 
confined spaces where youngsters play. 
</P>
<P>
 But dog owners railed against the idea of further restrictions on animals. 
They said the fault lies with irresponsible owners who do not clean up after 
their pets. Already, dogs must be on leashes anywhere in town except at the 
city's fenced "Bark Park" on Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to impose further restrictions on pets -- at least for the moment -- 
the council recommended that the matter be directed to the city's recreation 
department for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop will be at the Veterans Memorial Community Center, 384 Legion 
St., at 5:30 p.m. The goal will be to define key concerns about pets and then 
identify possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who wish to contribute but cannot attend the meeting are encouraged to 
mail suggestions to the Recreation Committee, 515 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach, 
Calif. 92651. LESLIE EARNEST

 A 25-year-old Kansas woman was killed when she was thrown from her car early 
Saturday morning after a collision with another vehicle at an intersection, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanna Seasel was southbound on North Main Street when she slammed into a car 
headed east on West Taft Avenue about 2:30 a.m., Orange Detective Sean O'Toole

UPGRADE OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM STUCK IN HOLDING PATTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an Aeromexico jetliner collided with a light plane over Cerritos in 1986 
-- one of the deadliest air disasters in Southern California history -- 
government safety investigators pinpointed an unlikely cause: the U.S. air 
traffic control system. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash came as the government was in the early stages of developing a 
state-of-the-art computer system that was supposed to let controllers better 
handle air traffic in the nation's increasingly crowded skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, that computer project is itself a disaster -- a case of bureaucratic 
bumbling, corporate failings, repeated delays that have set back the project's 
completion at least two years and one of the biggest potential cost overruns in 
U.S. government history: $2 billion and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the official in charge of the $5-billion project, U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena, recently called the snafus "appalling and 
unacceptable," vowing that the Federal Aviation Administration will take "any 
and all steps necessary to get this project on track," if it isn't canceled 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is far more than another government contract run amok. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 million airline passengers each year put their lives in the 
hands of U.S. air traffic controllers and their equipment, a figure the FAA 
expects to soar to 750 million by the end of the decade. Already, the agency 
estimates, the U.S. system handles half the world's commercial airline traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA says the new computer network, known as the Advanced Automation 
System, is a must if controllers are to handle that surge while maintaining 
safety. Many of the system's existing computers are hopelessly antiquated at 20 
years old. The improvements are being paid for largely by airline passengers 
themselves, via an 8% federal ticket tax that goes into an aviation trust fund 
for capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, however, the overhaul is only getting more muddled. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA just replaced the project's top managers, and a pending review is 
likely to bring more big changes to the project's blueprints to rein in runaway 
costs. The IBM division building the system was just sold.  
</P>
<P>
 All of this is occurring against a backdrop of White House and congressional 
debate over whether the computer system's snafus are proof that air traffic 
control should be turned over to a semiprivate corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is in such disarray that FAA chief David Hinson told a 
congressional hearing earlier this month that simply canceling the program is 
"an option that's clearly in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hinson also said he is pushing ahead to complete the computer overhaul 
once its problems are fixed -- a strategy backed by the nation's airlines and 
controllers. 
</P>
<P>
 The current system "is being stretched to the margins," said Will Faville, 
director of safety and technology for the National Air Traffic Controllers 
Assn., the controllers union. "We certainly need new equipment, and we need it 
yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the existing system is still the safest in the world because the 
FAA keeps airplanes spaced far apart, according to Robert W. Poole Jr., 
president of the Reason Foundation, a Los Angeles think tank that advocates 
privatizing air traffic control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety valve is that they slow everything down whenever (the system is) 
stretched," Poole said. "That more or less works, but we pay a big price in 
terms of the number of hours of delays that we encounter as air travelers." 
</P>
<P>
 With passenger traffic rising, the delays will only get worse unless the new 
computers are installed, said Philip M. Condit, president of Boeing Co., the 
world's largest maker of jetliners. "The technology is available today . . . to 
put a lot of capacity in the system. We need to get on and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Transportation Safety Board, nearly 1,000 people 
have died in crashes of major U.S. commercial airlines since 1983. Last year, 
however, the figure was zero. The FAA began to consider modernizing the air 
traffic control system 13 years ago, but the plans took on added urgency eight 
years ago on a quiet Labor Day weekend, as Aeromexico Flight 498 prepared to 
land at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The controller guiding the DC-9's descent was briefly distracted when a light 
plane appeared on his radar screen, seeming to threaten the big jet's airspace. 
Moments later, the Aeromexico jet collided with a second small plane that the 
controller later said he never saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Both planes plunged 6,500 feet into a residential neighborhood in Cerritos, 
killing 82 people, including 15 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB concluded that the crash cause was not caused by human error but by 
"systemic" failures in the air traffic control system. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: equipment limitations and outdated traffic control procedures that 
forced pilots to rely too heavily on the old-fashioned "see-and-avoid" concept, 
which presumes them capable of spotting other planes in time to take evasive 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the new system been in place in 1986, there is no guarantee it would have 
prevented the Cerritos disaster, according to Faville. Yet that crash, and 
others blamed on air traffic control problems, dramatically illustrated the 
need for a new system, FAA officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 One year after the NTSB determined the cause of the crash, the FAA awarded the 
initial $4.7 billion in contracts to install the Advanced Automation System. 
The biggest chunk, $3.6 billion, went to IBM's Federal Systems division. 
</P>
<P>
 That unit -- recently sold to Loral Corp., a defense electronics concern -- 
was supposed to put a powerful, full-color computer workstation in front of 
each controller. The workstations would provide advanced radar, weather and 
flight data that would be seamlessly fed into the computer's software. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be one of the most daunting and complex commercial computer tasks 
ever undertaken -- even for IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is leading-edge" technology, said one of the managers involved in the 
program, who asked not to be identified. "It's a tricky thing to build, and 
it's not clear IBM really understood where all of the pitfalls were ahead of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The IBM (now Loral) group, which has 1,000 people working on the system in 
Rockville, Md., was to have developed the first workstation prototype by now. 
It has not, and the first machine to be installed, at an FAA site in Seattle, 
is not scheduled to begin operating until mid-1998. The rest of the system 
probably won't be in place until the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays, of course, cost money. The FAA now estimates that unless corrective 
actions are taken, the modernization will cost at least $2 billion more than 
originally planned only six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's chief counsel, Mark Gerchick, vowed that the FAA will fix the 
project's woes in time to head off those kinds of cost overruns. "We are not 
going to have this projection become a reality," he said. "We could not be more 
serious about that." 
</P>
<P>
 But the FAA itself has played a sizable role in the delays by making several 
changes to IBM's system. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the agency had once hoped to consolidate the more than 200 air 
traffic control facilities into 22 sites and to upgrade all airport control 
towers with the new computer system. Both plans were scaled back sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the FAA is making more changes to fix AAS. Hinson recently named Robert M. 
Valone, a former official of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, to take over the troubled project. Hinson is also demanding 
that Loral guarantee it will get the project done on time and within budget 
from now on. 
</P>
<P>
 Responds Loral Chairman Bernard L. Schwartz: "We understood the extent of the 
problems" before buying the division, "and we're happy to step up to those 
responsibilities." (IBM declined to comment.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of this morass are Schwartz's new employees in Maryland who are 
actually designing the system and struggling to end the controversy. "There's 
no question there's been distractions," said one source who's worked with the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer team is also being shadowed by Hughes Aircraft Co., which, having 
lost a bitter battle to IBM for the original AAS contract, is poised to rescue 
the project if Loral stumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 At a congressional hearing earlier this month, a Hughes group vice president, 
Robert H. Kramp, said his company "stands ready to help in any way we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House, the airlines and others think part of the solution is to take 
air traffic control from the FAA and turn it over to a quasi-private company 
that would run it more efficiently. But some members of Congress, citing safety 
concerns, object to the idea, despite the AAS debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. William F. Clinger Jr. of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the 
House aviation subcommittee, said that despite the "horrendous (cost) overruns 
and time delays," he is skeptical that taking air traffic control from the FAA 
would make the system more efficient without sacrificing safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's 14,700 controllers are stationed not only in airport towers, but 
also in dozens of "terminal radar approach control centers" located near 
airports and in the 22 "en route" centers in the United States, which guide 
aircraft over the vast stretches of airspace between airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The en route center serving Southern California is in Palmdale, and a visit 
there reveals why the system needs a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
 At peak shifts, as many as 85 controllers sit in a room the size of a 
high-school gymnasium, its ceiling two stories high. The room is kept dark so 
controllers can read their monochrome green display screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The controllers must also use old-fashioned paper strips that provide flight 
data on each aircraft they're guiding -- the type of plane, its speed, 
altitude, planned route and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Under AAS, those details -- along with weather data and a variety of other 
information -- would be electronically fed into the controllers' computers and 
shown in color on their main display screens. AAS is also supposed to give the 
controllers exceptional reliability. Pieces of the existing system now crash at 
random, but AAS is expected to fail no more than a total of three or four 
seconds a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question now is whether Loral and the FAA can turn the project around 
-- assuming it is not canceled. Clinger, for one, believes the project will be 
finished, even if it's a shadow of its original design. 
</P>

JAMES FLANIGAN: OIL INDUSTRY'S MOST LASTING RESOURCE IS KNOWLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without widespread notice, a change has occurred in the world oil business 
that will have long-term implications for U.S. job-seekers and investors, 
companies and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook has shifted to growth. The International Energy Agency, an 
organization of petroleum-consuming countries set up in the 1970s, recently 
forecast strong increases in energy demand from now until 2010, with oil usage 
growing 4% a year in Asia and less rapidly elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 But prices will barely increase. The energy agency predicts a world oil price 
of $28 a barrel in 2010, and other experts say it could be closer to $20. 
Either way, allowing for inflation in the intervening years, that would be no 
rise at all. 
</P>
<P>
 That means oil and gas will be plentiful, not only in the Middle East but in 
Russia, China, Vietnam and other areas of the world where vast oil deposits are 
only now being discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 And U.S. industry, thanks to multiple advances in technology, will lead the 
way in developing and producing the oil of Russia, China and elsewhere. The 
industry's prospects are one reason oil stocks have been strong lately, while 
shares of other businesses have gyrated and declined. 
</P>
<P>
 But no business is simple these days. Like all other industries affected by 
information technology, oil is a study in contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Big companies are shedding employees; geologists have difficulty finding work. 
Yet the numbers of independent oil and gas companies are rising sharply again, 
after a horrendous decline in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of turmoil in the U.S. industry, America's young people seem uncertain 
whether it offers opportunity. Geology enrollments at the University of Texas 
are well below levels of the early '80s. But they have turned up recently, 
thanks in part to undergraduate and graduate students from Brazil, Indonesia, 
India and elsewhere, who see the oil business now operating in their countries 
as high-tech, global and with a long and profitable future. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, oil contains lessons for all business -- and a particular lesson for 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, it can teach the power of technology to create new opportunities 
and renew old ones.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Russian Arctic, Texaco, Exxon, Amoco and Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian 
company, are awaiting Russian government approval to develop a 2-billion-barrel 
deposit. The approval is probably forthcoming, because Russia is in desperate 
need. Its oil production, which led the world only a few years ago, has fallen 
more than 50% since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs U.S. technology and know-how to develop its oil," says Daniel 
Yergin, head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and co-author of "Russia 
2010," a new book about the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Others want help too. China is inviting U.S. companies to explore the Tarim 
Basin in its northwestern desert. Vietnam is granting oil concessions off its 
shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are forbidding areas. Oil can be developed economically only because 
supercomputers can interpret geological information faster and better, meaning 
fewer wells are drilled and less time is lost. Joseph Tovey of Tovey & Co., an 
investment bank that shares in a concession off Vietnam, reckons oil can be 
found and produced there for $2.50 a barrel, about what it cost for North Sea 
oil development 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, new oil and gas have been found in old wells in the Gulf of Mexico, 
thanks to sound-wave techniques that can "see" through more layers of the 
Earth's subsurface. On land, old wells are yielding new output because of 
better information and techniques involving steam and carbon dioxide injection. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is possible because more powerful computers reduce costs. "We now can 
do in hours what used to take weeks," says Dirk Koerber, vice president of 
investor relations at Western Atlas International, a newly independent oil 
service firm spun off last month from Litton Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 That brings up Lesson 2: Information technology makes low overhead essential. 
The cost equations in the Gulf of Mexico or the Arctic Ocean make sense only if 
fewer people can do more work in less time. So big companies continue to 
downsize -- even sell properties they cannot produce profitably, but which 
smaller companies can. 
</P>
<P>
 That has helped the little guy. "The number of solid, independent companies 
sank to only 19 in the '80s," says Tom Petrie of Petrie Parkman, a Denver-based 
investment bank. "But now there are 45 good outfits like Anadarko, Apache, 
Louisiana Land. And the ranks are growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson 3: Globalization brings competition along with opportunity. As the big 
oil companies shift investment overseas, jobs shift also. There are exciting 
opportunities for geophysicists and petroleum engineers educated in U.S. 
universities. But for less-skilled jobs on rigs and drill sites, local 
employees will be hired. And all over the world, ambitious young people are 
studying for the high-skilled jobs too. 
</P>
<P>
 The business is oil and gas, but the most valuable commodity is knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frequently, national oil companies in other countries will send their 
brightest employees to study here," says Prof. William Galloway of the 
University of Texas' geological sciences department. "We educate them, and they 
work in their home country." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Petrie observes, "Houston is still the center of the world oil industry. 
Singapore and London are subcenters, but the know-how of world oil is in 
Houston." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston is an object lesson for Los Angeles and Southern California. When oil 
prices dropped in the 1980s, Houston lost jobs, population, companies and real 
estate values. But what remained became stronger, and what endured was 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California today remains a world center for knowledge in 
entertainment; computer software; aerospace science, from satellites to 
transport; commerce with Asia and Mexico; finance; housing, and patterns of 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 And knowledge has become the business of America. Whether in an oil field or a 
classroom, the United States is selling education and brainpower to the world. 
It's a worthy export to other countries and an essential pursuit for our own 
people.

CLINTONOMICS UNDONE; THE 'INVESTMENT' CANDIDATE PROVES A DEFICIT HAWK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was chilled and overcast as the borrowed corporate jet, inbound from 
Washington, sliced through the cloud cover into the Little Rock, Ark., airport 
early on the morning of Jan. 7, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rubin, a wealthy Wall Street financier and one of President-elect Bill 
Clinton's closest confidants, had arranged for the plane so they could all fly 
down together: Rubin, Lloyd Bentsen, Leon Panetta, Ira Magaziner, Roger Altman, 
Alice Rivlin and perhaps half a dozen others. Tumbling onto the Tarmac came 
most of the Clinton brain trust, an eclectic group of millionaires, academics, 
consultants and career politicians, men and women with almost nothing in common 
save their ambition to serve in the first Democratic Administration in 12 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 Rubin saw his main task as the "honest broker," the coach who would make sure 
everyone felt part of a team. And it was arguably the most important team in 
the country -- the economic policy players of a new President who had just won 
the White House at the end of the longest economic slowdown since World War II, 
a President elected on a promise of jobs, growth and fundamental economic 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet already, petty feuds and policy differences had turned erstwhile allies 
into rivals. Magaziner and Bob Reich, for example, had co-authored a book and 
worked side by side through the long ordeal of 1992. Now, before Clinton could 
even take the oath of office, they had engaged in a bloody battle for position 
in the new Administration. Their camaraderie had soured into mutual contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Others -- Bentsen and Panetta among them -- were newcomers brought in during 
the presidential transition to add credibility or diversity to the new 
government. Yet they cared little what Clinton might have said on the stump in 
Atlanta or Los Angeles the previous autumn. Indeed, Panetta, one of the leading 
deficit hawks in Congress, publicly criticized Clinton's economic program in 
the midst of the campaign while privately warning Clinton that the numbers 
behind his campaign's economic plan didn't square. Rivlin, regarded as the most 
knowledgeable budget analyst on the team, was already irritating campaign 
veterans with her single-minded focus on the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Clinton needed -- and wanted -- these newcomers. They gave him gravitas 
and spelled stability to Wall Street, which was still skittish over the recent 
transfer of power in Washington. The bond market in particular was worried that 
Clinton would inflate the deficit with his promised new spending programs.  
</P>
<P>
 So, in his key appointments on economic policy -- the heart and soul of the 
new Administration -- Clinton was turning to America's financial and political 
elites, just as John F. Kennedy, his role model, had done more than 30 years 
before. In Rubin, for example, Clinton would have his own Douglas Dillon, the 
Republican Treasury secretary whom Kennedy recruited from Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 By early January, a quiet coup was in progress. With Clinton's approval, the 
newcomers were taking charge, gradually distancing the President-elect from the 
rhetoric and ideas of his campaign. And by the time Clinton settled into the 
White House, a stunning transformation would occur. 
</P>
<P>
 A buoyant campaign agenda emphasizing expanded federal "investment" in 
infrastructure, technology and people would become a dour prescription 
stressing deficit reduction above all else. A promised tax cut for middle 
Americans would be jettisoned in favor of tax hikes hitting squarely at the 
suburban classes. 
</P>
<P>
 To a considerable degree, the first liberal Democratic President in 12 years 
would be leaving the fate of his presidency in the hands of Wall Street's most 
conservative and skittish creatures: bond traders. 
</P>
<P>
 That was fine for the White House in 1993, when rates were steadily declining. 
But by February, 1994, when the Federal Reserve Board began raising rates and 
the stock market fell off the cliff, Clinton would find himself strapped into a 
deficit-reduction straitjacket. And, like George Bush before him, he could do 
little but watch from the sidelines as economic policy moved against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in early 1993, all that was in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 That January, almost as if by some mysterious alchemy, Bill Clinton was 
changing into a completely different -- and far more conservative, 
tradition-bound -- politician than the one who had been elected the previous 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, the new President and his defenders would acknowledge the sea 
change in his economic plan. But they would publicly blame it on circumstances 
beyond their control. They would insist that the federal deficit turned out to 
be even bigger and more frightening than anyone had imagined; they argued that 
officials in the Bush White House had hidden the extent of the problem until 
the last days before Clinton's inauguration. And when Clinton and his team 
realized just how bad the deficit really was, they were forced to rethink their 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But extensive interviews with top Administration officials, including 
virtually all of the President's key economic advisers, reveal that this 
rationalization was largely disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 For months before the election, Clinton and his closest aides knew that the 
budget numbers in his campaign agenda didn't add up and that candidate Clinton 
had promised far more than he would be able to deliver. They also knew by the 
summer of 1992 that the deficit was much worse than was assumed in their 
campaign documents. But they refused to change the obsolete arithmetic on which 
Clinton's campaign economic plan was based, for fear of attracting negative 
press coverage and attacks from the Bush campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Clinton's closest confidants also recognized that in his heart of 
hearts, Clinton was much more of a deficit hawk than the media or the American 
electorate ever would have guessed.  
</P>
<P>
 So a sharp reversal from Clinton's campaign agenda was inevitable all along. 
Indeed, senior Administration officials, including Bentsen and Panetta, concede 
that the professed shock at higher deficit estimates issued after the election 
was largely feigned. Moreover, the new Clinton team issued initial budget 
projections soon after taking office that put absolutely the worst face 
possible on the deficit outlook, manipulating data to reinforce the impression 
that Bush had left Clinton with a fiscal nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 The expressions of outrage were designed in part to provide political cover 
for the policy coup that was already well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10 a.m. on Jan. 7, as movers down the hall packed up the President-elect's 
belongings, Rubin and his entourage filed into the dining room of the Arkansas 
governor's mansion. They sat down around the long dining table for a meeting 
with Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore. The session continued until 5 
p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the first meeting of Rubin's National Economic Council, a new 
Cabinet-level organization that would come to hold sway over most domestic and 
international issues requiring presidential attention.  
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, many of the participants now concur, that marathon meeting and a 
lengthy follow-up session a week later were two of the most critical events of 
the first year of the Clinton presidency. During those sessions, Clinton took 
the final step away from his campaign's economic agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of five deficit-reduction paths presented as options during the Jan. 7 
meeting, Clinton chose the most aggressive. It called for cutting the deficit 
to roughly $205 billion by fiscal 1997, the final year of his first term. That 
meant slicing $140 billion from that year's projected shortfall as part of a 
multiyear deficit reduction package that would lock Clinton into set levels of 
spending throughout that term. 
</P>
<P>
 As every budget analyst knew -- and as many told Clinton the previous year -- 
the only way to make a dent in the deficit would be to take money from the 
middle class, something he had sworn not to do during the campaign. So 
Clinton's $60-billion tax cut for the middle class would finally have to be 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place, the Clinton team would propose a startling substitute: a 
$71.5-billion energy tax that would land squarely on middle-class Americans. 
There would be other unpopular revenue items: a $29-billion proposal to tax 
Social Security benefits received by more affluent retirees and a Reaganesque 
plan to freeze cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits and 
other entitlement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Clinton's investment agenda would be scaled back, leaving some 
aides bitterly disappointed. During the campaign, Magaziner pushed for $50 
billion a year in new "investment spending." Instead of these more ambitious 
plans, Clinton would propose a $16-billion short-term stimulus plan, along with 
a five-year investment program starting at roughly $20 billion a year. Most 
analysts agreed that the economic effects would be so small that they would be 
drowned out by the new wave of deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 With its reliance on higher taxes to cut the deficit, Clintonomics was 
beginning to look a lot like Bushonomics. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Blinder was surprised just to be in the dining room with the rest of the 
Rubin group. A shy yet highly regarded Princeton economist who often commuted 
across campus by bicycle, he had been an occasional adviser to the Clinton 
campaign. But as the calls from Little Rock became less frequent in the fall of 
1992, he felt certain he would be passed over for a top-level Administration 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. Clinton turned to Blinder's old friend and former classmate, 
Berkeley economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson, to become the first woman to chair the 
White House Council of Economic Advisers. But Tyson, aware of her lack of 
experience in macroeconomic forecasting and analysis, asked Blinder to come and 
work with her. Blinder buried what few feelings of resentment he felt and 
became Tyson's No. 2 on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 So it fell to Blinder, perhaps the least political person present during the 
January sessions, to underscore for Clinton the potential impact -- and 
political risks -- of his new focus on deficit reduction. While campaign 
consultants Paul Begala and James Carville worried openly about the immediate 
political effect of broken promises, Blinder and Tyson feared the new strategy 
could threaten the fragile recovery, making it more difficult for Clinton to 
generate new jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 "The worst-case scenario of the policies we're now considering," Blinder told 
the President-elect, "is a George Bush-style recession." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a clear enough warning for a politician who had just beaten Bush with a 
campaign rallying cry of "It's the economy, stupid." Recalls Blinder 
matter-of-factly: "I think my statement caught his attention."  
</P>
<P>
 With his new agenda, Blinder warned Clinton, the only hope for economic growth 
would come from a potential beneficial impact on long-term interest rates. As 
the deficit fell under Clinton's plan, the government's borrowing demands 
should fall as well. So should long-term interest rates. Indeed, "long rates" 
had remained stubbornly high despite record-low short-term interest rates; 
economists called the phenomenon a "steep yield curve," reflecting the fact 
that many financiers weren't convinced that inflation was really whipped. 
</P>
<P>
 If the financial markets became convinced that federal borrowing demands would 
be permanently reduced, the yield curve could flatten. Interest rates on many 
loans and mortgages would subside, motivating consumers to buy more houses and 
cars. Rates on bonds would drop, prompting companies to borrow funds to invest 
in new plants and hire more workers. Under this scenario, a reduction in 
federal spending could, ironically, cause an expansion in the overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin and Altman, both fresh from Wall Street, were convinced that the markets 
were ripe for just such a chain of events. They persuaded Clinton to embrace 
their argument that aggressive deficit reduction would lead to faster economic 
growth. But academics Tyson and Blinder cautioned that this was all untested 
theory. Clinton would be counting on lower interest rates to accelerate the 
economy before the reduction in federal spending could slow things down. No 
administration had ever accomplished anything quite like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder and Tyson agreed with Rubin and Altman that deficit reduction would be 
the proper long-term policy. But they didn't want Clinton to be sold on the 
idea that it could guarantee quick economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence was spotty on whether the Rubin-Altman formula would benefit a 
President facing a four-year election cycle. True, the economic drag should 
prove temporary, while the benefits would be permanent and ultimately much 
larger. Over 20 years, Blinder said, the deficit reduction program could 
increase annual economic growth by 1.1% to 2.2% per year. But the costs were 
likely to outweigh the benefits for at least five years.  
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated, Clinton wanted better answers, better forecasts. Tyson said 
accurate economic models for measuring the effects of deficit reduction on 
interest rates didn't exist. Blinder warned Clinton that if he embarked on a 
regimen of stiff deficit reduction and budget restraint, he could be held 
hostage to the whims of the financial markets -- and the Federal Reserve Board. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had already met with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, but he had received 
no assurances of accommodation. Altman had met privately with some Fed 
officials who indicated they thought the size of the deficit package Clinton 
was considering was appropriate. There were no promises of additional interest 
rate reductions, though; the Fed had lowered short-term rates by four 
percentage points since the beginning of the Bush recession in mid-1990, and 
the central bank's inflation hawks feared any further cuts could prove 
combustible. 
</P>
<P>
 So Clinton's multiyear deficit reduction plan would limit his flexibility on 
economic policy, Blinder warned, potentially placing the fate of his presidency 
in Greenspan's hands. The same fate had befallen Bush after he agreed to a 1990 
deficit-reduction pact in which he too had broken a key campaign promise on 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really should get some kind of understanding with the Federal Reserve," 
Blinder told the President-elect.  
</P>
<P>
 When Greenspan sat next to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton during her 
husband's State of the Union address in February, many Fed watchers suspected 
that he had reached just such a detente with the President. The central bank's 
passivity for the remainder of the year also led observers to believe that 
Greenspan tacitly endorsed Clinton's deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But that perception was shattered at the start of Clinton's second year in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Feb. 4, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time in five years; 
it raised them again on March 22 -- and again last Monday. Now, with analysts 
predicting the Fed will continue to boost short-term rates steadily throughout 
the year, Clinton can only hope to influence it by putting some of his people 
on the central bank's seven-member board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the President made his move. His nominees: UC Berkeley's Janet 
Yellin, regarded as more concerned with unemployment than inflation, and Alan 
Blinder. If confirmed as Fed vice chairman, Blinder will become the odds-on 
favorite to succeed Greenspan when the chairman's term expires in March, 1996. 
Betting the House on Bonds 
</P>
<P>
 In his election campaign, Bill Clinton talked about major investments in job 
creation and training, infrastructure and technology -- a platform that 
frightened the financial markets but won him the presidency. Once in office, 
Clinton set out to win the confidence of the bond market, in particular, 
committing his government to lowering the federal budget deficit. The theory: 
Less federal spending and borrowing would lead to lower long-term interest 
rates, buoying consumer spending and business investment. It worked -- only too 
well, in the eyes of the Federal Reserve Board. Yields on 30-year Treasury 
bonds and rates on 30-year mortgages fell steadily until the robust recovery 
began making bond investors and the Fed nervous. The question now is if 
Clinton's theory -- and the economy -- will unravel as the Fed tightens credit.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: TO MINIMIZE '94 TAX BITE, PLAN A STRATEGY 
NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 By now, most Americans have put away the pencils, calculators and forms and 
vowed to forget about income taxes for another year. But if you're smart, 
experts say, you won't put away anything until you've considered ways to cut 
next year's tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Need a little incentive? The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit research group, says 
the average American works 125 days each year just to cover federal, state, 
local, excise and other taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxes are the average household's biggest expense -- they cost more than food, 
clothing and housing, the Tax Foundation says. Americans work 25 minutes of 
each eight-hour day to pay for recreation, but they work an hour and 48 minutes 
to pay their federal taxes, and almost another hour to pay state and local 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you reduce that bite? The first step is to take a hard look at your 
most recent tax return, says Philip J. Holthouse, a partner in the accounting 
firm Holthouse Carlin & Van Trigt in Los Angeles. The reason for taking on this 
onerous task now is twofold: Your information is as organized as it will ever 
be, and it's still fresh in your mind. Better yet, your tax accountant, if you 
have one, has plenty of time, now that the filing deadline is past, to discuss 
planning opportunities with you. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best tax-planning ideas are old standards: contributing to 
retirement plans, taking advantage of mortgage interest deductions, investing 
in tax-free municipal bonds and "bunching" certain expenses. But they've taken 
on greater significance -- and there are a few new twists and turns -- under 
the 1993 tax act passed last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few ways to come out ahead on next year's income tax bill: 
</P>
<P>
 * Convert consumer debt: If you own a home and have revolving balances on 
credit cards, consider paying off the consumer debt with a home equity loan. 
Most people can borrow up to $100,000 to pay off consumer loans -- credit 
cards, car loans, personal lines of credit -- and deduct the interest from 
their income on their annual tax return, says Ken Anderson, a partner in the 
national accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Co. Since loans secured by real 
property are usually less expensive than unsecured credit, you'll save interest 
expenses too. 
</P>
<P>
 * Save for retirement: If you're not already contributing the maximum amount 
to a 401(k), individual retirement account or Keogh plan, seriously consider 
doing so. All these savings plans allow eligible Americans to deduct their 
contributions from income. And the interest earned is tax-deferred -- you don't 
pay tax until you start pulling the money out, presumably at retirement age. 
The bad news is that there are hefty tax penalties for early withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seek tax-free income: Income earned on municipal bonds is tax-free for 
everyone but retirees. (Technically, the municipal bond income is tax-free for 
retirees too, but it pushes more of their Social Security income into the 
taxable column.) And, thanks to the bond market's collapse and rising tax 
rates, the tax-equivalent yields on these bonds can be generous even if you're 
not in the highest federal tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Income earned on certain insurance products, such as tax-deferred annuities, 
is also tax-deferred until retirement. But you get hit with the tax penalties 
if you withdraw the money early, and you may also get hit with insurance 
company penalties, called surrender fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bunch deductions: Take a close look at last year's tax information to see if 
you missed limits on itemized deductions by small amounts. If so, try to bundle 
deductions by pushing certain expenses into a single year. For instance, 
medical expenses are deductible only if they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross 
income. If you get close to that threshold in one year because of an unusual 
event -- the birth of a child or unexpected surgery, for example -- consider 
pushing voluntary medical expenses, such as check-ups and prescription drug 
purchases, into the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Go back to work: There's very little that retirees can do about the higher 
Social Security taxes that go into effect in 1994. But if you are retired and 
happen to have "passive" losses from rental real estate, you have a unique 
opportunity, thanks to last year's tax act. If you go to work 750 hours a year 
in real estate -- and real estate is your primary occupation -- you can deduct 
your real estate losses against ordinary income. That has the dual effect of 
reducing your taxable income and reducing the income that's subject to the 
higher Social Security tax, Holthouse says. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, anyone who has substantial passive losses might want to consider 
real estate as a part-time profession, but it's harder to meet the "primary 
occupation" test if you have another job as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donate appreciated property: The way you give to charity can have a 
substantial impact both on how much you can give and how much the charity gets. 
Whenever possible, give appreciated property rather than cash. Last year's tax 
act exempts such gifts from the alternative minimum tax, which previously could 
trip up such donors. 
</P>
<P>
 How does giving appreciated goods help the taxpayer? Consider the hypothetical 
Jane Smythe, a well-heeled taxpayer who wants to donate $10,000 to her favorite 
cause. She happens to have $10,000 in stock she purchased for $5,000 five years 
ago. She considers selling the stock to make the contribution, but if she does, 
she'll have to pay a 28% capital gains tax on the $5,000 gain. That costs her 
an extra $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 If she gives the shares to the charitable organization, she gets the $10,000 
charitable-contribution deduction. The charity gets a $10,000 security it can 
sell. Because the charity is tax-exempt, nobody pays a capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stress capital gains: The 1993 tax act widened the disparity between 
ordinary income tax rates -- which now go up to 39.6% -- and the capital gains 
rate of 28%. To the extent it fits your investment strategy, stress price 
appreciation rather than dividend or interest income with new investment 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buy business property: You can now "expense" -- write off in the year 
purchased -- up to $17,500 in property purchased to operate a small business. 
Business property worth more than that must be depreciated by a set schedule, 
usually over five to seven years.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: ONLY 1 SPOUSE'S BENEFITS AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I am a 64-year-old widow and still working. My husband died at age 67 
before he had claimed any Social Security benefits. Upon retirement, may I 
claim both widow's benefits and my own? What happens to my Social Security 
benefits if I invest the life insurance proceeds I got when my husband died? -- 
A.W .  
</P>
<P>
 A. Upon retirement, you are entitled to claim the greater of the benefits -- 
either your own or those your husband was eligible to receive at the time of 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Your life insurance proceeds should not directly affect Social Security 
benefits. Only being employed can reduce your monthly payments. This year, 
recipients under 65 lose $1 for every $2 they earn in excess of $8,040 a year; 
Recipients 65 and older lose $1 for every $3 earned after they have earned 
$11,160 in the year. There are no earned-income restrictions on recipients 
older than 70. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, you should still understand that Social Security recipients who do 
not work but still have what the government considers substantial annual income 
do face taxation of Social Security benefits. This is where invested insurance 
proceeds could affect your Social Security payments -- not directly, but 
through the tax collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's sweeping changes in the rules governing taxation of Social 
Security income are too detailed and complicated to describe here. Although the 
changes involve the internal revenue code, your local Social Security 
representative should be able to explain how they apply to you. You should also 
consult the Internal Revenue Service pamphlet "Social Security Benefits and 
Equivalent Railroad Retirement Benefits." To order a copy, telephone (800) 
829-3676. The American Assn. of Retired Persons is also giving away a 
publication titled "Will Your Social Security Benefits Be Taxed?" To order it, 
call (202) 434-3870. Home Value Transfers Cannot Be Reversed 
</P>
<P>
 Q. In a recent column, you mentioned that some counties are pulling out of the 
special program that allows older homeowners to transfer the assessed value of 
the residence they are selling to the new home. Does this affect homeowners who 
have already taken advantage of the transfer? -- J.L . 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. Once homeowners have received the exemption, they will not be affected 
by a subsequent decision of the county to drop out of the program. For readers 
who may not be aware if it, California voters approved an initiative in 1988 
allowing homeowners 55 or older to transfer the assessed value of their 
previous home anywhere within the state, as long as the value (or purchase 
price) of the new residence was equal to or less than the net sale price of the 
old. The initiative stipulates that homeowners could take advantage of the 
exemption only if the county to which they were moving opted to participate in 
the special property assessment program created by Proposition 90. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the boards of supervisors of 12 counties -- Alameda, Inyo, Kern, Los 
Angeles, Marin, Modoc, Orange, Riverside, Santa Clara, San Diego, San Mateo and 
Ventura -- have agreed to participate. At one point, Contra Costa County had 
joined, but it has since withdrawn, and Riverside County supervisors have 
indicated an interest in following suit. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say that once taxpayers are granted the Proposition 90 
exemption, it is theirs as long as they remain owners of the home. Because 
homeowners are entitled to a single exemption over their lifetimes, the 
exemptions may not be transferred to a subsequent new home purchase, regardless 
of whether the county of residence is a member of the Proposition 90 program. 
Bond Proceeds Lose Tax-Free Status in IRA 
</P>
<P>
 Q. If I bought municipal bonds for my individual retirement account, would the 
interest from the bonds be exempt from taxes when I withdrew the funds? S.P . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Despite what you might have read or been told by some hustling investment 
counselor, municipal bonds, or any other tax-exempt investment, are poor 
choices for an individual retirement account. Why? All withdrawals of 
previously untaxed money from an individual retirement account are taxable, 
regardless of the type of investment the funds are in.  
</P>
<P>
 So even if the funds are generating what would otherwise be tax-free interest, 
because they are in an IRA, that interest is taxable at the time the money is 
withdrawn. You do not want to put your IRA savings into tax-exempt securities, 
which typically earn less interest than their taxable counterparts, if those 
funds are going to be taxed anyway when you withdraw them. Advertising 
Investment Yields: Yearly Is Rule 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why do banks and savings and loans advertise their interest rates and 
yields exclusively in annual terms? It seems unfair to list an annual yield 
when an account term is less than one year. -- S.T.A . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yields of accounts of less than 12 months maturity are "annualized" to make 
it easier for customers to compare rates. Why? Because there is no other 
commonly accepted method of advertising and comparing investment rates. Perhaps 
more important, thrifts are required by federal law to post only annualized 
yields, to help customers compare various investment opportunities, regardless 
of the term. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the practice of annualizing yields unfair if an account runs for less than 
one year? That's a matter of some debate. Clearly, a $1,000 certificate of 
deposit earns less in six months than it would if invested for a full year, but 
that difference is so apparent on its face that investors should hardly be 
surprised. Furthermore, as long as all investments are advertised and measured 
by the same yardstick, savers can easily decide which is best.

Q & A; HOLLYWOOD TIMES THREE; DEBBIE REYNOLDS AND CARRIE FISHER DISCUSS 
HOLLYWOOD FAMILIES, NOT-SO-FICTIONAL NOVELS -- AND BABY BILLIE'S THERE TO 
CHAPERONE 
</P>

 "Is something burning?" 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment Debbie Reynolds pads into her daughter's cathedral-sized 
living room, carrying a large kitchen knife and sniffing the air, you know 
you've entered the house of mirth a la Carrie Fisher. Of course, there are 
plenty of clues outdoors: the Santa and reindeer on the lawn, two plastic beef 
carcasses leaning against the fence and all those signs -- No Vacancy, Lover's 
Lane, That Very Evening -- not to mention Fisher herself, scampering down the 
path, barefoot, in wet hair and a floor-length panne velvet dress. The house is 
famous -- Edith Head and Bette Davis each called this rambling, Spanish-style 
ranch house home before Fisher bought it last year -- but now it is the 
distinct province of the 37-year-old writer and sometime actress who is 
Hollywood's de facto Dorothy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher comes from Hollywood royalty -- Reynolds and Eddie Fisher -- but she 
has made her own mark in town as a script doctor and novelist. Steven Spielberg 
hired her to buff Tinkerbell's lines in "Hook." Whoopi Goldberg brought her on 
board to polish "Sister Act." Fisher's first two books, "Postcards From the 
Edge" and "Surrender the Pink," were best-selling chronicles of her life, her 
recovery from drug abuse and the breakup of her marriage to singer Paul Simon. 
Meryl Streep, Fisher's close friend, starred in the 1990 film of "Postcards" 
and Demi Moore is expected to star in "Surrender the Pink," when Fisher 
completes a rewrite of the script. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Fisher is basking in the generally positive reviews for her 
autobiographical novel "Delusions of Grandma," which charts the birth of her 
first child, Billie, and the breakup of her relationship with CAA agent Bryan 
Lourd. She is just days from leaving for Europe, more publicity for the book, 
and then a week visiting Gore Vidal on Italy's Amalfi Coast. "I know the book 
jacket says I divide my time between Los Angeles and Florence," she says in her 
famously throaty voice, "but I just made that up because it sounded so great." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher's household resembles nothing so much as a hotel, filled as it is with 
animals (including a parrot), staff, family and friends. A three-way interview 
with her mother and daughter about their lives in Hollywood becomes a rambling, 
disjointed conversation that has as many exits and entrances as a bedroom 
farce. A carefully orchestrated photo shoot in the back yard -- Fisher, 
Reynolds and squirming 20-month-old Billie in a hammock -- becomes its own 
occasion for pratfalls when the hammock unceremoniously dumps all three to the 
ground. "OK, OK, we're up," says Reynolds, scrambling to her feet, her face as 
composed as a freshly smoothed pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Fisher retires to her bedroom, where beneath the deep-blue ceiling 
embellished with gold stars and moons she seems to find a soothing environment. 
Sitting cross-legged on her massive bed, alternately smoking and fingering raw 
brownie dough from a dish, she confides to being a little daunted by the 
challenges of being a single mother in Hollywood's fast lane. Her frankest 
remarks about Lourd are made off the record -- more sad than mean. By 
conversation's end, Fisher is completely prone, under her expensive 
hand-embroidered French sheets, thoughtfully blowing smoke at the stars above 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Fisher: You know, someone came in the other day and said, "Your house 
is so Catholic now. But that's original (pointing to an antique-looking icon 
perched on a ledge up near the ceiling). It was Edith's. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Reynolds: It's Mission style. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I wouldn't mind being Catholic, because they seem to get over things 
really quickly -- they go to church, they sing, they confess. Or they become 
Madonna and go on TV and say (expletive) 13 times. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: Now, you're not making fun of Catholicism, you just like the objects. 
People are so sensitive about their religion, I don't want the press to think 
--  
</P>
<P>
 CF: No, I'm saying it would be good to be Catholic. I was raised Protestant 
but I'm half-Jewish -- the wrong half. They got ticked off in Israel when I 
went there with Paul (Simon) and we had gotten married by an Orthodox rabbi and 
I hadn't converted. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: You have to convert to make the Orthodox happy. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: How long does that take? 
</P>
<P>
 DR: Only eight weeks, it's not a long booking. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Well, how long does it take to become a Catholic, so you can go into that 
box and say I did this stuff and now I'm sorry? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Doesn't writing thinly veiled autobiographical novels serve the same 
function? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: It's like AA -- you get up and say things about yourself; I don't consider 
it confession, but it's acknowledging. You act like yourself and after you've 
done it for so long you become who you think you are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: This novel seems fairly revealing of your private life. Doesn't writing 
about yourself, even in fictional form, affect you? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Well, this book prolonged the difficulty of my separation (from Lourd), 
because it held my attention to it -- that I have a child with someone who is 
not around, and I'm sorry to be in that situation because I know what it's like 
to be that child. But it's the first book I wrote while I had a child and a 
child really changes things. Over Christmas when I was editing the galleys, I 
couldn't pay that much attention to her and she got pissed off -- at four 
months! So finally I just said, "Take the book." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Debbie, how has having Carrie's first child -- and her writing about it so 
publicly -- changed your daughter? The title refers to you. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: Carrie really wanted this baby. She's wanted one since she was 11, when I 
was going to give away all her baby clothes and she came in and said, "Well, 
what will my baby wear?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Yet Carrie, you lead a very public life. You also grew up with a very 
public mother who worked a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Did you ever meet anyone who said, "I had the greatest childhood"? Yes, I 
worried that I would neglect her at close range, because I am a working mother. 
I know that she will feel somewhat neglected, but she really won't be aware of 
it until she gets to be 13 or 14 -- that's when I got very resentful of my 
mother's work. But I also have an obligation to a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There were some difficult times in your life, Debbie, when your second 
marriage (to businessman Harry Karl) ended and you had to go out on the road to 
support Carrie and Todd. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: When Carrie was 14, my second husband lost all his money and all my money. 
We started over again and he hit the road. And it was hard for Carrie when I 
had to devote so much time to work and not enough to her and she got angry with 
me, and she didn't understand --  
</P>
<P>
 CF: -- how tough it was for her at 38 to fall out of a marriage and lose all 
her money. I can appreciate it now, but when I was 14 I got very arrogant, 
because I had gone through est or something. And she had also lost two children 
-- two children born dead. 
</P>
<P>
 (She gets up.)  
</P>
<P>
 I'm having a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: (after Carrie leaves for the front porch) But anyway, all that hurt 
Carrie's growth at a very tender age. Finally we found a psychiatrist, when she 
was 15, and I think that helped her a great deal. After she grew up, she found 
out I was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: (yelling from the porch) My fear is that I will be crushed in an elevator 
and my mother will get hold of my journals from my adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: (as Carrie re-enters the room) Do you think the two of you are alike? 
You're public personas are so wildly different. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I think we are -- the energy I have comes from her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about your satirical side? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Not in the same way. But she uses her Tammyness to great effect -- she 
works against it and is able to be audacious in the darnedest ways. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: Both Carrie and I have strong, definite personalities -- I'm a true Aries 
and she's a true Libra. I was never frightened of being in front of an 
audience; Carrie is much shyer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you feel inadequate compared to your mother's fame and beauty? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Not the fame part, but the beauty. I would see her after parties looking 
perfectly pulled together. That scene that I put in the book, when Cora tries 
on her mother's wedding dress, was actually Mom's wig. (To her mother) Do you 
remember? I was in your dressing room and I put it on thinking maybe this will 
do it for me and I looked like a thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: You thought you would be transformed into a blue-eyed blonde. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Billie? Are there similarities there? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: We are all bossy. (To Debbie) Grandmother is extremely bossy, you are, I 
am and now Billie is. This is what she says: "No work"; "Get off the phone"; 
"Come play." 
</P>
<P>
 DR: I think she's very bright, like Carrie. Very demanding, wants attention, 
is very spoiled -- and Carrie is all of that. She talked at six months.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But you successfully convinced (Carrie) to go to drama school in London, 
which led to her career as an actress. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: As a rule I gave in to her, but this was too much. We had played the 
Palladium in London when Carrie was 17 and we did three performances together 
and Carrie just killed them. The reviews said, "Debbie Reynolds is the gold of 
vaudeville, and she has brought us the platinum." 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I thought that meant I was bad. But then I figured out what platinum meant 
and I thought I could become like Liza Minnelli. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: But while we were in England she had also auditioned for the Central Drama 
School and she got a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Then I left because I got "Star Wars."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Carrie, can you talk about that quality of being observed -- it seems to be 
in your style of humor as well, the art of the put-down. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I always felt that we were being looked at: "She's Debbie Reynolds and 
Eddie Fisher's daughter and she thinks she's so special." So I wanted to be 
able to walk in and say, "I'm so fast you don't have time to think it." 
</P>
<P>
 DR: Carrie has definite problems putting herself down. She is the most 
attractive --  
</P>
<P>
 CF: She always tells me, "Don't be so hard on yourself, dear," like it's 
something you can just go, "Oh, OK, thank you for reminding me, I'll stop now." 
. . . It's that Jewish Angst thing. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: I'm not going to comment on that. We've already hit the Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't some of that just endemic to growing up in Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Yeah, people think you have it so great. But I wanted to be like everybody 
else; in order to fit in, I put myself down. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: I'm not as nervous about myself because I wasn't brought up in the 
business. I had a normal life; we didn't meet movie stars. We lived in Texas 
where you had rollerskates and if you got a bicycle that was a very big gift. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: (picking at her fingernails) I felt disadvantaged by my advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: She peels them down to blood. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I can't help it; I'm just finishing this one nail. I just quit smoking 
because I got pneumonia, but like Mark Twain says, "I quit as easily as I 
start," and --  
</P>
<P>
 DR: Honey, your eye . . . 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Is it all falling down? The bleeding eye. It's those talk shows. When I 
looked at the tapes of myself I thought my arms looked like blood sausages. 
</P>
<P>
 DR: You see, she doesn't need a critic. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I have one: Ralph Novak at People magazine, remember? He wrote about my 
first book: "Darth Vadar should have killed her when he had the chance." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 (She gets up.)  
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me, I'm going to go check on the toasting of Billie. She's napping, or 
what I call "browning on two sides." 
</P>

<P>
 Q: In her novel, Carrie attributes several negative attitudes toward men to 
the mother's numerous marriages. Do you take any of that personally, Debbie? 
</P>
<P>
 DR: I was married to Eddie Fisher when I was 22 and he left when Carrie was a 
year and a half. Then I was married to Harry Karl, who was 25 years older than 
myself because I wanted someone who would take care of us. I was married 14 
years to him. I remarried 10 years ago, but now I'm separated -- another 
crisis. So I'm not one to advise about marriage. I should see a board of 
directors who should vote on who I should date. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about Carrie's situation, being a single mother of a young 
child? 
</P>
<P>
 DR: I'm always sad to see a relationship not work, but what happens between 
two people is not my business. I feel very happy she has the baby. I just don't 
think marriage is in the cards -- for Carrie or me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think it's harder to maintain a relationship in Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 DR: I just think it's hard for all women who are powerful or out front with 
themselves. Men can find beautiful young ladies who don't mind walking in their 
shadow because they can shop on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 (Carrie re-enters with Billie, the nanny, who carries a child-sized plate of 
food , and various assistants in tow.)  
</P>
<P>
 DR: There she is! She's a happy girl now. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: (starting to feed her) We're having sweet potato. 
</P>
<P>
 Billie: (screaming) Nooooo! 
</P>
<P>
 CF: OK, OK, OK -- let me get it out. We used to like sweet potato. Come on, 
give us the smile you did when Mickey Mouse came to visit one weekend and sang 
"Happy Birthday" by mistake. . . . Come on, Billie, show everybody how pretty 
your eyes are. 
</P>
<P>
 BL: (screaming) Nooooo! 
</P>
<P>
 CF: They're more green than mine are, more like the father --  
</P>
<P>
 DR: -- son and Holy Ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I was going to say, the father has blue eyes. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 (Later, after Reynolds has left for the airport, Fisher holds court in her 
bedroom -- cigarettes, a Coke and her dish of brownie dough at her side.)  
</P>
<P>
 CF: I gained so much weight with the baby, I said I looked like a frying pan 
with features. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you hide from all your famous friends? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Oh, yeah, I had most of my relationships on the phone. I was so 
embarrassed because I realized how much I depended on at least a modicum of 
good looks. Even though I'll say I don't like my looks, I was sure I was 
somewhat attractive. So there I was thinking, well, I've had a kid and this is 
old age for me. It wasn't until Bryan and I had the split-up that I lost like 
20 pounds in two weeks, which was the only good thing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been so unstinting in condemning Hollywood for making it difficult 
to achieve an equal relationship --  
</P>
<P>
 CF: -- and if you're more powerful than they are you're emasculating them. And 
I'm not revising that, I only hope I'm wrong. But also, I do have this big loud 
life and so the other person has to crawl in there and find some peace. Even 
when I was with Paul, he liked more privacy than me; we'd go off to Montauk for 
the weekend and Ed Begley Jr. would call and that was a big deal, like, "Why is 
Ed Begley calling?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do you gravitate toward groups so much? You once said that you like to 
be 'the mayor of the group." 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I have smart friends. My biggest fear is that everyone is going to move to 
New York after the earthquake. (David) Geffen told me he might move and Meryl 
is going to go back and Buck Henry already spends a lot of time in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Even your screenwriting is personal: You wrote a pilot that was based on 
you and your mother's relationship, and the new TV series you're writing for 
Carsey-Warner is about you to some extent. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: The character is like me, but you know, this whole house could be a 
series. During the fires last fall, singer Patti Smith, who lives in Topanga, 
moved in here with her daughter and a dog and a cat and two mice and we lived 
in this room. We watched the TV for the fire updates to see if her house had 
burned and we called it "Fire Watch: The Series." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's next for you? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: What I want to do doesn't matter because I have to service my overhead, 
which is enormous. I still own my other house, which I bought for $1 million 
and I can't rent because it got damaged in the earthquake. And I bought this 
house for $2.5 million so I'm like --  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Nervous? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Bryan and I split Billie's care, but there are other issues, like I moved 
into this house thinking we would be here together -- we decorated it together 
-- and now you could argue that since he left, I should sell it. But I think 
I'm going to try it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your salary on script-doctoring has been pegged at about $100,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: But you don't get those all the time, and I only just did my first one in 
almost two years -- for Michael Caton-Jones -- because of the baby and the 
book. It's great but now I have to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you considered writing more of your own scripts and think about moving 
into directing as Penny Marshall and Nora Ephron have? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Oh man. Nora's kids are older and she's married and she didn't do that 
until she was 50. So maybe I could when I'm 50. How old would Billie be? 14? 
Yeah, I could do it -- but I would like to have another child. I think the 
easiest thing to do would be to have it with a friend. I suggested it to Albert 
(Brooks) and I told him between the two of us a bolt of lightning would come 
out between my legs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is marriage out of the question? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I thought when we had a child together that was more than married. Albert 
was saying to me, "Who are the models we can look at and say, 'That's a great 
marriage' "? Tom and Rita Hanks have a great relationship. Maybe I can just get 
into theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're joking, but it also sounds like you're genuinely disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: I was genuinely happy when I conceived and I thought at that point we were 
going to make it. (Lourd) comes from a background of great stability, and he 
presented himself as very reliable and straightforward. But coming up against 
my life. . . . The one thing I ended up coming away with is that if you want to 
be in a relationship, everything is negotiable -- and ought to be, if you have 
a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Billie spends Wednesday and Friday nights with Bryan and I think it's 
important because I didn't see my father a lot.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: He always seems mentioned, like part of your resume. 
</P>
<P>
 CF: Yeah, but would I go to my father for advice? No. Well, maybe about 
kicking drugs or something. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So there is something you want to give Billie that you didn't have? 
</P>
<P>
 CF: A father -- and that's a big thing for me to give.

JOHNNY ROTTEN OR SUNSHINE?; DESPITE PLAYING A SOCIOPATH IN MIKE LEIGH'S FILM 
'NAKED' AND A PEDOPHILE IN THE UPCOMING PBS SERIES 'PRIME SUSPECT,' ACTOR DAVID 
THEWLIS DOESN'T WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR HIS SAVAGE ROLES. NOW LIVING PART-TIME IN 
L.A., HE TURNS OUT TO BE AN ACCENTUATE-THE-POSITIVE KINDA BLOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeing a slightly disheveled David Thewlis sauntering through a somber room 
full of assorted levels of pricelessness in the L.A. County Museum of Art, it's 
hard not to flinch just a little bit, even though you know better. 
</P>
<P>
 Thewlis' retinue assures all comers that this Londoner is the gentlest of 
actorly souls. But his two most prominent performances so far, both as vicious, 
violence-prone street-dwellers -- first, playing a likely sociopath in Mike 
Leigh's film "Naked," and, this week, a pedophile on the public-TV series 
"Prime Suspect" -- have seemed almost too frighteningly good not to be true. 
And so when you see him walk up with the cowlicks in his hair not quite kempt 
and his clothes not quite pressed, you remember the two roles and forget 
yourself. And worry for the Hockney a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Thewlis has come not to slash the Hockney, but to praise it, of course. He 
just met the painter the other day, and points out that David Hockney, like 
himself, is a Northern Englishman come to Los Angeles, a fellow "working-class 
bloke" in the land of plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Hockney's own vision of local plenty that made Thewlis fall in love with 
L.A.; he just recently become a part-time resident, in fact. We're standing in 
front of the artist's wall-sized canvas, "Mulholland Drive: The Road to the 
Studio," an illogically colorful, slightly surrealist view of Hollywood as an 
inviting series of weird rolling hills, a wonderland cut up by friendly 
highways and unfettered by fires or riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been here before, but when my wife and I first came to the museum in 
June, seeing this painting was the first time I kind of fell in love with 
something about L.A.," explains Thewlis. "I sat before it for about 20 minutes 
and just loved it so much it made me feel better about the city. It makes me 
see it in a whole different light, as less hostile, where there's something 
possibly quite beautiful about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably very romanticized, but that's the L.A. that I like, there," he 
says, with a nod toward the Hockney. "I found the things here that I'm happy 
with, and know what to leave aside." 
</P>
<P>
 This is most definitely not Johnny talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny is the accentuate-the-negative bloke Thewlis plays in Leigh's "Naked," 
an unforgettable role that won him the award for best actor of 1993 from the 
National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics, the London Film 
Critics' Circle and the Cannes Film Festival panel, among other accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny is the punk-rock ethos made flesh, a walking diatribe railing against 
God's inhumanity to man, a brilliant, angry raconteur whose uncompromising 
insistence on alienating everyone he meets relegates him to haranguing fellow 
street people instead of his intellectual peers. Johnny is someone who, from 
his lowest-class London vantage point, sees only chaos and no order, and has 
become the world's most engagingly sardonic rage-aholic, if not the most 
agreeably "anti" of all recent screen anti-heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Demanding a sit as it was, "Naked" did only moderate art-house business in 
L.A. after opening in December, although it has played successfully in New York 
through this month, and was especially widely seen in the industry because of 
videocassettes sent out for a long-shot Oscar campaign on Thewlis' behalf. 
Among his contemporaries, at least, Thewlis is already becoming the stuff of 
legend, based mostly on Johnny, the role of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who didn't get enough of Thewlis' nastiness in "Naked" can get more in 
the coming weeks with the third cycle of the gritty "Prime Suspect" series, 
which is extremely popular with audiences here as well as in its native 
England. (The four parts begin airing on a weekly basis this Thursday on PBS.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Prime Suspect" is a vehicle for savvy police investigator Helen Mirren, but 
although Thewlis' guest part is fairly small, he basically has the title role, 
as a homosexual pimp, child molester and all-around bird of prey believed to be 
a serial murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 As the "Suspect" of record he's even scarier -- and far less bright -- than 
Johnny, but the unsavory similarities between the two roles are unmistakable. 
Thewlis, who is reputable and peace-loving enough to have been given the run of 
the closed County Museum of Art for the afternoon, seems a little dismayed to 
think of the impression Americans might take away of him from these two parts 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange that the two things that I'm gonna get known for here in the 
near future are those two projects, because I play such a sadistic bastard in 
both of them," Thewlis says. "That's really not the sort of work I've been 
doing before; I'm not typecast in Britain as those kind of characters, and I'd 
never played those kinds of desperate, self-destructive, violent, aggressive 
people. 'Naked' was a real departure, and that's a credit to Mike, that he does 
allow artists to do something they've never done before." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This being a Leigh film -- which at no point in its creation or end result 
resembles a Hollywood picture -- there was no script drafted before the actors 
were assembled, and the players were responsible for writing their own parts in 
the months of rehearsal, creating situations and dynamics for the movie weeks 
in advance but usually coming up with the dialogue hours or minutes before the 
cameras roll. This demands a Method-ist devotion to the character, since 
without that kind of absorption on the part of the actor, there are no lines. 
</P>
<P>
 So Thewlis immersed himself in Johnny's interests, devouring heady texts on 
evolution, biology, social science, theology and the likes, so that he might 
come up with convincing harangues on why humankind might be coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was in direct response to the unrelenting negativity of his 
"Naked" creation that Thewlis deliberately chose to start wearing rose-colored 
glasses, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was perceiving the world in a very negative way, which was an adjustment 
that was difficult to make. But once I'd made it, it was difficult to come out 
of at the end of the film, because you've learned to see everything in such a 
dark light. You would find nothing beautiful or worthwhile. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, the whole experience made me much more hippie and Buddhist," Thewlis 
says with a slight smile. "That's where all this research drove me. It drove 
Johnny into something much more nihilistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at a stage now where I only find natural things really beautiful. I still 
see even this kind of beauty" -- he waves his arms at the naturalistic 
sculptures of the human form in one museum room -- "as still synthetic and very 
man-made. No matter what one looks at and finds temporarily pleasing, it can 
never be as beautiful as just a tree, really." He laughs slightly, admitting 
this is a philosophy he "never really had before." 
</P>
<P>
 In selectively looking at his adopted second city of Los Angeles, he also 
misses the urban forest for the trees, as it were, and doesn't concentrate on 
the blight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't stay here if I had that image, if I saw this place in that way, 
because it would depress me too much. That's how I see London, in a very 
depressing way -- hence, a lot of 'Naked.' You always have to look for 
something beautiful wherever you go. So the way I've been able to tolerate 
spending this much time here -- which I've needed to, for work reasons -- is to 
find something poetic about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe," he says, almost under his breath, "I'm deluded." 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have guessed: The Johnny Rotten of screendom turns out to be a 
Norman Vincent Peale in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thewlis' age is hard to place: Even with a mustache and growth of beard, his 
pouty lips help make him look a little baby-faced, a quality that sets off his 
sadism in these two latest roles in an ironic way. In "Naked," there's even a 
scene in which another character guesses how old Johnny is and, because of the 
character's haggardness, guesses way too high. In that movie, he was supposed 
to be in his late 20s but looked 40-ish; Thewlis recently turned 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to London, he grew up in a seaside town with parents who had 
bought a little store and made their way up to "shopkeeper class" -- a step up 
from most of his working-class relatives who lived in Yorkshire and toiled in 
the mines, but still a good step below middle-class on the United Kingdom's 
self-conscious social scale, he's particular to point out. 
</P>
<P>
 His acting career has come along in moderate steps: studies at the Guild Hall 
School of Music and Drama, theater at the National and the Royal Court, small 
roles in movies like "The Trial" and "Afraid of the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of his work has been on British TV -- hence, how little of it has 
been seen in America. "It's certainly true that television is definitely of a 
higher quality there than here. . . . There's not as much distinction between 
TV and film and theater in Britain, because most actors move comfortably 
between the three. You can't actually be just a movie actor in Britain, because 
we don't make that many movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he's quite jumped on the miserable bandwagon bemoaning the apparent 
slow demise of his homeland's movie industry. "I've never really taken an 
interest in what it actually means to say the British film industry is dying, 
in terms of what can be done about it seriously instead of 'Can we just have 
more money?' I mean, they're closing every hospital and school in England at 
the moment, and they're not going to give it to a lot of maverick filmmakers to 
make seditious anti-government films." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thewlis has worked extensively with the most seditious of them, including 
Ken Loach and the late Alan Clarke. His first fateful hookup with Leigh was on 
a short film, "Short & Curlies" (still seen regularly between features on Bravo 
cable). Their first feature together was the comedic "Life Is Sweet," in which 
Thewlis had one of the smaller roles, as the well-intended suitor who, 
memorably, licks chocolate off ornery Jane Horrocks' breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came "Naked," an experience so intense that Thewlis says he can't imagine 
taking on another Leigh movie for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will work together again, but I don't think it'll be for a few years, 
because it takes over your life; it's damaging, really, almost. Everything else 
is swept to the side -- relationships and friendships and family and any other 
concerns one might have. If you don't put in 100%, you suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Thewlis claims he doesn't have a violent bone in his body and has never even 
hit anyone, let alone committed the borderline date-rape that's Johnny's 
hallmark in "Naked." But inasmuch as he did invest parts of himself in the 
character, might that have been a scary thing to get in touch with, or just 
acting exhilaration? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it was both -- I mean, it was exhilarating because it was scary. And 
what it was was ridding myself of a lot of stuff I might have repressed all my 
life. An enormous amount of anger rose to the surface and was allowed to be 
released. And it was very liberating, as I was given license to scream and run 
through the streets and speak my mind at all times and to have no fear, really 
-- just somebody who doesn't give a (expletive). And most of us do give a 
(expletive) and we don't want to speak out of turn or do anything that would 
turn dissent upon us. My job was to basically irritate people most of the time, 
and in the research for the part and the exploring of the territory, I didn't 
care about anyone. That was kind of a liberating thing to go through, not to 
care at all what people think about you -- and in fact, quite the opposite, to 
really try and initiate hostility against yourself, so that you can rise to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after winning the first of his many best actor prizes at Cannes last 
year, he shot "Prime Suspect 3," which he still hasn't seen, though it has 
already been shown in Britain ("they even move the news for it; it's that 
popular"). It's riveting television that puts even America's best-made 
progressive cop shows to shame, but Thewlis sounds a little wary about watching 
the tape he was sent. He says that filming the carefully scripted series after 
the long, grueling collaboration of "Naked" came as something of a relief. But 
he says that he did miss having extended rehearsal times like those on the 
Leigh films, and that he isn't quite as satisfied with his performance as he 
might have been with more preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also difficult because it's hard to research something like that," 
Thewlis says of his kiddie-pimp character. How does one actually come to feel 
like that man must have felt, without actually becoming perverse oneself and 
breaking the law? Although my wife would come back and find me looking at 
Robert Mapplethorpe books and get very worried about me. I was looking at 
pictures of homosexual bondage and trying to find something in it that was in 
some way mentally having to do with it. . . ." He sounds frustrated even now: 
"I think I never quite latched onto it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stateside audiences will finally get to see Thewlis as something other than a 
nasty in this summer's family horse fable, "Black Beauty." Next up for him is a 
shoot in Wales, where he would like to settle down in the countryside with his 
wife and just paint, a la his new friend, the other David. 
</P>
<P>
 But his wife (Sara Sugarman, an actress who recently got signed to ICM, 
Thewlis says, by virtue of being funny at parties she would attend with him) 
would prefer to stay on full-time in L.A., and part of him would too, he 
admits. The recent flattery from the Hollywood film community hasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Spielberg the other day, and he told me he'd seen 'Naked' and really 
loved it, and said he'd sat up all night with Brian DePalma and Martin Scorsese 
in their respective apartments arguing about the film. Wow, I wish I could've 
been a fly on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he'd like to write a script about an expatriate British actor, "just about 
how one's life can change from one thing to another very suddenly, and getting 
swept along in a crisis of identity into the future and who you are and who 
your friends are." 
</P>
<P>
 And now that the rage of the English art-movie crowd is getting 
congratulations from the unlikely likes of Spielberg and Sylvester Stallone, 
would this fictional identity-crisis story Thewlis wants to write be a 
cautionary tale? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not complaining or suffering about it," he proclaims. "It's a 
wonderful thing to happen to one, as long as you keep an eye on yourself. All I 
did was I pretended to be someone else for a few months, and it appears I did 
it quite good, and that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, in daily life, he professes regularity. "I live in a very small flat 
in Soho. Most of my friends are out of work. I hang out in cheap coffee bars 
and clubs and at friends' houses which are kind of squats. But as soon as 
Cannes happened, it's like this little door opens and you're invited into this 
little club, which is the rich and famous." 
</P>
<P>
 Better he put off writing that particular script; like any actor who just 
graduated from friends on the dole to friends who just won Oscars, he sounds 
conflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do find myself just thinking a lot of the time it's just very strange what 
happened recently, just because I've been taken out of this one life and been 
put into this life here. I mean, here now -- talking to the L.A. Times in the 
museum of art and getting David Hockney's personal permission to have my 
picture taken here. . . . We're surrounded by surrealist paintings, but I mean, 
it's all surreal to me."

DANCES OF SORROW, DANCES OF HOPE; THE WORK OF PEARL PRIMUS FINDS A NATURAL 
PLACE IN A SPECIAL PROGRAM OF HISTORIC MODERN DANCES FOR WOMEN. PRIMUS' 1943 
WORK 'STRANGE FRUIT' LEAPED OVER THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED 
'BLACK DANCE'

 It's a fine day in New York in the wartime 1940s, and choreographer Pearl 
Primus is discussing poetry over lunch with blues singer Billie Holiday and 
lyricist Lewis Allan. Allan is chattering with animation about his poem 
"Strange Fruit," reciting lines Holiday herself has made famous in her baleful 
vocal rendition of the poem and which Primus, separately, has incorporated as 
the narration for a dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been silent through much of the lunch, Holiday finally reveals herself 
through the stricken expression that has spread across her face. And then it 
dawns on Primus that, until this very moment, Holiday has known nothing of what 
the poem is about, certainly not that it evokes the pain of African Americans 
in an era when lynching was still considered by some as appropriate for an 
"uppity" black. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'What do you think it's talking about?' " an incredulous Primus recalls 
asking Holiday, who was four years her senior and whom she considered both a 
mentor and a friend. "Of course, Lewis Allan just laughed. Black body swaying 
in the Southern breeze. Billie just didn't get that. You never heard of Billie 
having anything to do with any protest. That was not part of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday may have been naive about the meaning of Allan's poem. But the same 
could not be said of Primus nor of those second-generation modern dance 
choreographers of the 1930s and '40s whose work will be featured this week in a 
program titled "Weeping Women in Dance: Classic American Solos" at the Leo S. 
Bing Theater of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The program is being 
organized by Bonnie Oda Homsey as a project of the newly revived Los Angeles 
Dance Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven solos will be featured in performances by Homsey, company co-director 
Janet Eilber, former Jose Limon soloist Risa Steinberg and Cal State Long Beach 
dance faculty member Michele Simmons.  
</P>
<P>
 Martha Graham's 1937 "Deep Song" is a scream of protest against the fascists 
in Spain. It has been called Graham's "Weeping Woman," a reference to the 
Picasso painting of 1937 that forms the centerpiece of LACMA's current gallery 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Dudley's 1944 "Cante Flamenco" is an homage to the women's movement that 
arose during the Spanish Civil War. Eleanor King's "Wrath" deals with the 
violent rage that accompanied the start of World War II. And Anna Sokolow's 
"Kaddish," created in 1948, at war's end, is built upon the traditional Jewish 
prayer of mourning. (Earlier works of anger and grief -- Isadora Duncan's 1907 
"Furies" and Graham's 1930 "Lamentation" -- will also be performed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Primus is arguably the most political choreographer of the lot, or, at the 
very least, the most attuned to the issues of African Americans during the 
period between the two world wars. The year 1943 witnessed not only her 
performance debut but the creation of more than a dozen new works. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those works concerned the problems of poor blacks. In "The Negro 
Speaks of Rivers," based on the Langston Hughes poem, Primus depicts the plight 
of post-slavery African Americans working in chain gangs or in the cotton 
fields. "Jim Crow Train," from another Hughes poem, "Freedom Train," deals with 
segregation: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I hope there ain't no Jim Crow on the Freedom Train  
</P>
<P>
 No back door entrance to the Freedom Train,  
</P>
<P>
 No signs FOR COLORED on the Freedom Train,  
</P>
<P>
 No WHITE FOLKS ONLY on the Freedom Train.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a number of legendary dances that celebrated African heritage, 
Primus produced other dances of social concern as well, notably "Slave Market" 
(1944), "To One Dead" (1946) and a dance based on a spiritual, "Michael Row the 
Boat Ashore" (1946). 
</P>
<P>
 None, however, was as searing as the 1943 "Strange Fruit," which depicts the 
anguish of a white woman who had witnessed a lynching and who subsequently was 
filled with regret. And no dance was as radical in extending the boundaries of 
what was considered to be "black dance," for in "Strange Fruit," Primus danced 
the role of the white woman herself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 74, Primus appears so energized in rehearsal that it is easy to imagine her 
dancing "Strange Fruit" again, right now, on command. At the side of the 
rehearsal studio at Scripps College in Altadena, she sits squarely in a folding 
chair, shoes off, her body wrapped in volumes of green-and-maroon African 
textiles that make her small form seem much larger than it is. Only the gnarled 
hands with which she directs dancer Michele Simmons convey any sense of age or 
infirmity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to 'earth' that run more," she exhorts Simmons, who is struggling 
not only to learn the steps from a videotaped performance by Kim Y. Bears, a 
dancer with the Philadelphia-based Philadanco dance company, but to anchor them 
with the firm, grounded quality Primus prefers. (Etymologists take note: Primus 
may be the only choreographer in America to use earth as a verb.) 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with her head swathed in a turban and her arms and ears jangling with 
silver earrings and bangles, Primus easily resembles central casting's image of 
the African earth mother. It's a role she embodies without embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, at the American Dance Festival, she mentions after rehearsal, she ran 
into Chuck Davis, artistic director of the African American Dance Ensemble, 
along with a class of young students. "Here are your grandchildren," he told 
her. And with little more than a wave from him, all the students in the class 
prostrated themselves in homage. 
</P>
<P>
 Primus invited Simmons to call her Nma , a word which, in the Efik language of 
Kalabar, Nigeria, means "mother who did not birth you." 
</P>
<P>
 And from the style of this rehearsal, it is clear that the transmission of 
fundamental imagery and accumulated knowledge is even more important to Primus 
than simply repeating the steps. She is obsessed with details. "Remember what I 
said about the toes: They're like antelope hoofs," she says, laughing a bit at 
the absurd quality of that image. 
</P>
<P>
 Gestures are likened to the crawling motion of "miserable insects," a 
tendrilling hand is a "serpent," and the fateful lynching tree -- invisible to 
the audience -- is conjured as a part of the dancer's body. "Remember," says 
Primus, "the legs are the roots of the tree, growing out of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes more than an hour to chisel 30 seconds of choreography. Later, 
Simmons says that this glacially slow process is revelatory: 
</P>
<P>
 "At the first rehearsal, (Primus) said, 'Come, come,' and had me sit right at 
her feet. She talked to me for 2 1/2 hours about what this piece was about, 
about the outrage she and people like Adam Clayton Powell Sr. and Paul Robeson 
felt when they heard about the lynchings of African Americans in the South in 
the early 1940s. It was beyond what they could imagine. She said that was what 
inspired her to do this dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the spectator does not need to be told that "Strange Fruit" is an 
exploration of one woman's reaction to a lynching. But is the woman a relation 
of the hanged man? A friend? A lover? 
</P>
<P>
 None of the above, Primus told critic Margaret Lloyd in the late 1940s. The 
woman is a member of the mob, "screaming and shouting in animal fury with the 
rest." Writes Lloyd: "It is noteworthy that (Primus) identifies herself with a 
white person and has the acumen to see, even in a lynch mob, the possibility of 
remorse." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Simmons: "The woman was with a group of people who had been picnicking 
when the lynching occurred. And as she leaves the area, something makes her 
turn back and confront what has happened. 'What is this? This is not right,' 
she says." 
</P>
<P>
 But the piece is not fundamentally or exclusively angry, says Simmons. "It's 
more a question: What have we done to allow ourselves to get to this place?"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how she came to make such politically charged pieces at the tender 
age of 24, Primus is a bit stymied. "It was like a mandate," she says. "It was 
something I had to do. . . . I was given a body strong enough, I was given the 
schooling, I was given the people (to help me) and the dreams. And this is the 
work I was meant to do: to show the dignity, beauty and strength in the 
heritage of peoples of African ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't choose to dance about a flower or a running brook or something. I 
chose to answer the ills of society with the language of dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Trinidad, the granddaughter of a Vodoun doctor who could trace his 
ancestry to the Ashanti in Ghana, Primus moved to New York with her family at 
the age of 2. In the big city, her father held various odd jobs, from carpenter 
to seaman, while she, in school, excelled in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
 The tremendous jump she developed in sports served her well when, upon 
graduating from Hunter College, she could not find a job and found herself in 
the National Youth Administration dance company, first as a wardrobe mistress 
and then as a reluctant dancer when company member Joe Nash's partner dropped 
out in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash, now a prominent New York-based dance historian, was drafted soon after. 
But in 1943, upon hearing that the New York Times critic John Martin had named 
Pearl Primus "dance debutante of the year," he was so shocked that he wrote to 
Primus to warn her that someone must be using her name. 
</P>
<P>
 In between her first forays as an NYA dancer and her anointing by Martin, 
Primus had fashioned herself as an artist and dancer under the aegis of the 
politically oriented New Dance Group. Founded in 1932 to bring the uplifting 
force of dance into the lives of oppressed peoples -- especially blacks and 
Jews -- the dance group studio and company allowed Primus to work with Martha 
Graham followers Jane Dudley and Sophie Maslow.  
</P>
<P>
 Modern dance was growing into a dynamic art form. The training was serious. 
And the concert stage -- not the big entertainment venues -- quickly became 
Primus' highest goal. Later this would distinguish her from Katherine Dunham, 
the other well-known African American choreographer of the era who became 
famous in slick revues as well as Hollywood films. 
</P>
<P>
 "She took (African and West Indian) culture and theatricalized it," Primus 
says, with a slight edge in her voice. "In speaking and dancing truthfully 
about (these cultures), I was the anthropologist." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic, then, that Primus' big break came at Cafe Society Downtown, a 
New York nightclub run by Barney Josephson, where she became the toast of the 
town in 1943. Critic Edwin Denby wrote three glowing reviews of her dancing at 
this club over a six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is an unusual dancer and deserves her quick celebrity," Denby wrote in 
the New York Herald Tribune, marveling at the height of this small woman's 
jumps and the intelligence of her choreography. "All her movement has a native 
Negro quality -- an unction and a spring -- that is a great pleasure to watch. 
In schooling she is a strict 'modern'; but the personal simplicity of her 
dances and her clear sense of drama and climax make her numbers easy for any 
audience to follow. For her best effect she needs a good deal more room that 
she has on the floor of Cafe Society, but at least she couldn't find a more 
attentive nightclub public." 
</P>
<P>
 The public at Cafe Society, as distinguished from venues like the Cotton Club 
of the 1920s and '30s, was decidedly integrated. It was there that Primus met 
such arts notables as Paul Robeson, Marian Anderson, Hazel Scott, Josh White, 
James Baldwin, Fats Waller, Mary Lou Williams. And a blues singer named Billie 
Holiday, who on more than one occasion was at Cafe Society for Primus' shows, 
sidled up by the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 years have gone by since all eyes seemed to turn in Primus' 
direction. Since that time she has traveled extensively in Africa on a 
fellowship from the Rosenwald Foundation; married and toured with her husband, 
the Trinidad dancer-choreographer Percival Borde (who, she says, is "now with 
the ancestors"); bore a son, Onwin, who arranges music for many of her pieces; 
earned a Ph.D. from New York University; taught extensively at the University 
of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has earned many honorary doctorates and major awards, including the 
President's National Medal of Arts in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 How odd it is, then, that very little of Primus' work has been recorded on 
film or video. A handful of works have been staged by the Alvin Ailey American 
Dance Theater, but they are not in the repertory now. The American Dance 
Festival has funded the re-creation of three early solos, including "Strange 
Fruit." But given Primus' age, there might not be that much time left to 
reclaim the dances that reside nowhere but in her own body. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is Primus' reluctance to give her pieces to other dancers, 
even though she can't perform them herself any longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't create 'Strange Fruit' for a dancer," she explains. "I created it to 
make a statement within our society, within our world. And therefore, it was 
made with my body. When I danced it, I wasn't male or female. I wasn't the 
wind, I wasn't a tree. I was a concept."*

WHEN 'X' DOESN'T MARK THE SPOT; IN A TIME WHEN YOUTH CULTURE IS KING, WHY ARE 
HOLLYWOOD'S GENERATION X MOVIES, MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, SHUNNED BY THE X-ERS? 
MAYBE FILMMAKERS SHOULD LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THEY THINK THEY'RE TALKING TO

 "Reality Bites" executive producer Stacey Sher couldn't have been happier. 
There she was, buying CDs at Tower Records, and the tousled-haired clerk 
bagging cassettes behind the counter -- the hippest guy in the room -- was 
proudly wearing a "Reality Bites" button on his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sher mentioned she'd been involved with the movie, the Tower clerk 
exclaimed: "Oh my God, that's so cool! I've listened to the soundtrack about 
4,000 times." Then one of his co-workers jumped in. "Hey," she said, "you 
haven't even seen the movie!" 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk shrugged. "Come on, I work at Tower Records. I can't afford to go to 
movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, the Tower clerk, like many of his Generation X brethren, 
don't seem to be going to the movies the way they used to -- at least not to 
movies about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1989 with the release of "Heathers" and "sex lies, and 
videotape," a wide array of young filmmakers have surfaced, making a series of 
quirky films aimed at the scruffy core of the twentysomething marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Focused largely on brooding, disillusioned youths absorbed in edgy 
relationships and turbulent romances, the films have been alternately praised 
and reviled by critics. Some, like "Kalifornia," were instant bombs. A few 
lower-budget entries, like "Benny & Joon," turned a modest profit. One classic 
alienated outsider tale, "Edward Scissorhands," was a major hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But none have captured the elusive spirit of a generational moment, as "The 
Graduate" did for disaffected youth of the late '60s, "Saturday Night Fever" 
for the self-discovery of the disco era or "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" for 
the teen anxieties of the early-'80s mall culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by strong word-of-mouth and what seemed like a picture-perfect 
marketing campaign, Universal Pictures' "Reality Bites" had the heady scent of 
a generational impact film when it hit theaters in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
 Its star, Generation X goddess Winona Ryder, graced the cover of Rolling 
Stone. Details gave its cover to co-star Ethan Hawke. Director and co-star Ben 
Stiller was everywhere on late-night TV. GQ, Sassy and Vanity Fair did 
celeb-struck profiles of the film's stars. Time, Newsweek, Entertainment Weekly 
and The Los Angeles Times weighed in with rave reviews. MTV did a "Big Picture" 
special edition devoted to the film. Its soundtrack rocketed into the Billboard 
Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more importantly, "Reality Bites" seemed to catch a pop-culture wave: 
Newspapers debated its Generation X merits in Op-Ed page stories. Local deejays 
started obsessively playing "My Sharona," the 1979 teen anthem revived on its 
soundtrack. Even the New Republic's Michael Kinsley used the movie's portrayal 
of out-of-work slackers as a hook for a column about the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the hoopla, the $11-million film never caught fire. It is inching 
toward a gross of $20 million, meaning its modest profits will come from its 
home-video release. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little depressing," says Sher. "My crackpot theory is that we made a 
really good movie for people who can't afford to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coined by Douglas Coupland in his 1991 novel, "Generation X" is a classic 
sound-bite catch phrase. Beloved by the media, it is loathed by everyone forced 
to wear the tag, even if it's no more bogus than previous media convenience 
labels, including such whoppers as the Beat Generation, the Flower Power 
Generation and the Me Generation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to media and marketing mavens, Generation X-ers are post-baby 
boomers, a generation born roughly between the Cuban missile crisis and 
Watergate. They've been depicted -- and often depict themselves -- as 
overeducated and underemployed. Cynical and disillusioned. Media savvy and 
equally media suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 You've seen the snapshot: White middle-class kids raised on junk sitcoms and 
trashy rock bands who hang out in coffee bars, wear thrift-store threads, smoke 
Marlboro Lights and save up for Lollapalooza tour tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, this generation is far more culturally diverse, just as likely to 
harbor a preppy neo-conservative as a grungy slacker. But, like the media, 
Hollywood goes for the stereotype. For decades, it has viewed rebellious youth 
as lucrative box-office fodder, supplying a new icon for each generation, from 
James Dean and Jack Nicholson to John Travolta and Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 As teens in the mid-'80s, Generation X-ers were ardent film consumers, making 
hits out of such adolescent fantasies as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," "Risky 
Business," "Pretty in Pink" and "The Breakfast Club." 
</P>
<P>
 But today something seems amiss -- both economically and culturally. In an era 
where every other youth culture trapping is booming -- be it MTV, alternative 
rock, Fox TV, Reebok or the Gap -- Hollywood's Generation X movies are, with 
rare exceptions, underperforming at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the presence of such appealing young actors as Ryder, Johnny Depp, 
Christian Slater, Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, the films often have trouble 
connecting with their core audience, much less crossing over to older or more 
mainstream moviegoers. Even the most high-profile films, most notably "Reality 
Bites" and "Singles," hit the wall short of a $20-million box-office gross. 
</P>
<P>
 Of equal concern is the nagging sense that many Generation X-ers -- loyal 
moviegoers all through their teens -- are dropping out of the box-office 
equation as they reach their 20s, preferring to buy CDs or stay home and rent 
videos. It's hard to say whether they are turned off by movies in general or 
just movies about themselves. Either way, they seem deeply skeptical of 
Hollywood's attempts to market nonconformity -- and suspicious of the way their 
age group is portrayed on screen. When it comes to pop icons, they prefer Pearl 
Jam and Soul Asylum to Ethan Hawke or Christian Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever is happening, it is beginning to worry top film executives. "We are 
going to be in big trouble if we can't find a way to reach this audience," says 
Caravan Pictures chief Joe Roth. "As a generation, they don't feel a part of 
the tribal rite of going to the movies. The habit just isn't there, which 
doesn't bode well for the future of movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth believes Generation X-ers are going to see big hits like "Jurassic Park" 
or "The Fugitive," but not movies about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's troublesome, because a big part of filmgoing has always been using 
movies as a way of identifying with your personal experience -- of wanting to 
see movies that speak directly to you," he says. "But that's not true for 
today's young audience. If it was, 'Reality Bites' would have had the kind of 
impact of 'American Graffiti.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Why does Pearl Jam, MTV's "The Real World" and even "Melrose Place" seem to 
connect with a generational sensibility that has so far eluded Hollywood's 
cinematic reach? Are today's filmmakers out of touch with their own generation? 
Or are young moviegoers wary of any generational portraits, regardless of how 
grungy or gloomy the sketch? 
</P>
<P>
 To find some answers -- or at least hear some intriguing theories -- we sought 
out a variety of Generation X commentators (and a few token baby boomers) from 
the cutting edges of popular culture. They volunteered some savvy -- and 
startling -- opinions about their generation's disquieting sense of malaise 
about moviegoing. Too Much Reality  
</P>
<P>
 "Why on Earth would you want to sit in a movie theater in your checkered shirt 
and Army boots and watch movie characters sitting around complaining in their 
checkered shirts and Army boots?," says Toby Hood, 26, national manager of 
college radio promotion at MCA Records. "Why not just walk out the door, go 
down the street and see it for yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I have close friends who really resemble that Ethan Hawke character," says 
Kalle Matso, 26-year-old film critic for the weekly Manhattan Beach newspaper 
the Beach Reporter. "But if they have time to catch a flick, they'd go see 
'Belle Epoque' or 'Die Hard 3.' The last thing they'd want to see is 
Hollywood's take on Generation X." 
</P>
<P>
 "At 25, I've got to deal with a delinquent American Express card, car payments 
-- I'm living beyond my means," says Damon Lee, an assistant to the producer on 
John Singleton's "Higher Learning." "Johnny Depp's a great actor, but when I go 
to a movie, I don't want to see someone with more problems than me." The Video 
Alternative  
</P>
<P>
 "I never go to movies -- there's too much emotional intensity in seeing things 
on the big screen," says Shann Nix, 27, a San Francisco-based novelist and 
talk-show host. "We're VCR babies. We're very fragile. We like to hold things 
at a distance. With video, the impact of movies isn't so overwhelming. You can 
be in control. You can stop, start, fast-forward. You can't do that in a movie 
theater."  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first generation that grew up without having to go to a theater 
to see a movie," says Andy Fleming, 31, director of the new Generation X film 
"Threesome." "When I was growing up, if you didn't see a movie right away, it 
disappeared. Now you can find it anywhere -- on cable, on home video. There's 
no urgency to seeing it in a theater." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a theater the other night when a trailer came on for a film that's 
probably going to be the No. 2 summer movie at a major Hollywood studio," 
recalls Joe Roth. "And when it was over, some guy in the back of the theater 
yelled out, 'Video!' And half the theater applauded. I got a chill down my 
spine, because I was thinking -- that could've been one of my films." X 
Economics  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything about the economics of our core-audience demographic points to our 
movie being a smash on home video," says "Reality Bites" producer Michael 
Shamberg. "Maybe we can't get them to pay $7 to see a movie in a theater. But I 
bet they'll pay $2 to see it on video." 
</P>
<P>
 "I only go see movies if I don't think they're ever going to show up on home 
video," says Jim Barber, 31, an Atlanta-based A&R executive at Geffen Records. 
"Some of it's just economics. If I buy a CD, I have it forever. A movie's a 
one-time thing. Sometimes you remember it the next day and sometimes you 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we analyze material," says Michael De Luca, 28, president of production 
at New Line Cinema, "the first thing we ask is, 'Why would someone pay $7.50 to 
see this?' " The X Brand  
</P>
<P>
 "Our generation doesn't exist -- that's why no one's going to see these 
movies," says Nix. "Today's kids have rap and Thrasher magazine and the 
jeans-hanging-down-to-your-knees street stuff. That's a genuine subculture that 
horrifies adults. We were just cute and confused. We never had an aesthetic of 
our own." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty dubious who Generation X really is," says Nina Jacobson, 28, vice 
president of production at Universal Pictures. "Just because we have a name for 
it doesn't mean it actually exists. Mostly, I think it exists in the mind of 
the media." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a cultural phenomenon that was labeled before it actually happened," 
contends Fleming. "Remember what Nietzsche said: 'If you name something, you 
kill it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "We never refer to our audience as Generation X-ers," says Doug Herzog, MTV's 
senior vice president of programming. "They don't want to be categorized. They 
really resent it. If they feel overanalyzed by the media, they rebel against 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We cringed when we saw all the advance articles talking about our movie as a 
Generation X statement," says Bruce Feldman, senior vice president of marketing 
and promotion at Universal. "We were aiming for a much broader audience. But 
once the press labeled it that way, it became a picture only for the X 
Generation." Too Hip  
</P>
<P>
 "Movies like 'Kalifornia' and 'True Romance' were too hip for their own good," 
says De Luca. "The kids in movies like 'Reality Bites' are white, upscale and a 
little whiny. I don't see the young Axl Roses out there in Indiana feeling that 
they can share in that experience." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ethan Hawke character in 'Reality Bites' was a total phony," says Stan 
Evans, 30, a producer of E!'s "Talk Soup." "It turned me off. It was as if the 
only way to be cool was to be totally detached -- you know, the nobility of 
sitting on a couch, full of deep, pretentious phrases." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the 'slacker' character is a little off-putting," says producer 
Shamberg. "In retrospect, if the Ethan Hawke character had been conceived of as 
more of an everyman, it might have struck a chord with a broader male 
audience." Immediacy  
</P>
<P>
 "The soundtracks to 'Singles' and 'Reality Bites' speak to what the movies are 
about much better than the movies do," says Barber. "Music is more immediate. 
No matter how personal his movie is, Ben Stiller needs hundreds of people and 
$10 million or $20 million to make it. Our hottest record right now, 'Loser' by 
Beck, was done in one night on an eight-track machine in the guy's house." 
</P>
<P>
 "When a band makes a record, they don't have four executives show up in the 
studio and say, 'So, what are the marketing possibilities?' " says Hood. "When 
too many people have too much input in the creative process, it loses what 
makes it personal and intuitive." 
</P>
<P>
 "People connect a lot more with the Wednesday-night TV shows -- 'Melrose 
Place' and 'Beverly Hills, 90210,' " says Mark Lewman, 26, editor of Dirt 
magazine. "They just seem more timely, more in touch with people our age. The 
next day it's all we talk about -- everyone has a morbid fascination with 
them." Don't Believe the Hype  
</P>
<P>
 "Having a movie made about us automatically gets our back up," says Nix. 
"We're like jeans -- we come pre-faded and pre-jaded. We hate being labeled. So 
by definition, anything designed specifically for us is offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 "If your movie looks anything like a Hollywood movie, the Gen X audience will 
be a hard sell," says De Luca. "The marketing on 'Reality Bites' just smelled 
of Hollywood trying to be hip. I liked the movie. But did you see its poster -- 
with the graffiti on the wall saying, 'movie poster'? It said: Look how hip we 
are. It made me immediately not want to see the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Hollywood handled 'True Romance' was typical," says Hood. "They 
wouldn't let Quentin Tarantino direct it. Instead, they took a movie that was 
aimed at a generation that totally loathes commercials and hired a guy to 
direct it (Tony Scott) who makes millions doing what -- making commercials." 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, 'Reality Bites' was so ersatz -- it's a TV version of my reality," 
says Barber. "It was like a Hollywood attempt to take my life, package it and 
sell it back to me." Baby-Boomer Anxiety  
</P>
<P>
 "There's as much a wall between Generation X and the baby boomers as there was 
between the boomers and their parents," says Shamberg. "It's almost like the 
boomers' motto is: Don't Trust Anyone Under 30." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these movies scare off older audiences," says Herzog. "They look at 
the characters and say, 'Who are these people?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really interesting to see how totally irritated Siskel and Ebert were 
that Winona Ryder went off with Ethan Hawke instead of Ben Stiller," says De 
Luca. "They kept saying -- he lies on the couch all day, he's a slob, he 
doesn't have a job. Why didn't she go off with the responsible guy? They didn't 
see the movie as critics. They saw it as parents." Prognostications  
</P>
<P>
 "The Gen X movie that will probably go over the top won't be one that's 
authentic and has all these brooding guys in goatees," says Matso. "It'll 
probably be like 'Jurassic X Park.' A movie with X-ers, but with special 
effects by ILM." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of nerdly to go to a Hollywood film these days," says Nix. "When 
you think of Hollywood, you think of Exxon and Coca-Cola. It's much more cool 
to stay home and watch a black- and-white '50s movie on video." 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on how you define the movie," says Jacobson. " 'Indecent 
Proposal' was about the economic struggles of a young married couple. 'The 
Firm' was totally about being twenty-something in the '90s. They were both big 
hits. I don't think our batting average is different from any other 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
 "You make movies about people, not about generations," says Fleming. "It was 
probably a lot easier before it occurred to people that there was a generation 
between being in high school and getting married." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ben Stiller and Ethan Hawke are going to go on to make lots of movies that'll 
be big successes," says Shamberg. "It may be that there's a box-office ceiling 
on this generation's subject matter. But I don't think there's a ceiling on 
their sensibility." Benchmarks, Dude?

COVER STORY; A KINDER, GENTLER SPIKE?; SPIKE LEE HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO THRIVE ON 
CONTROVERSY. BUT WITH 'CROOKLYN' HE'S MOVED INTO A QUIETER ZONE. IT'S ABOUT THE 
DAILY LIFE OF A BROOKLYN FAMILY IN THE 1970S. BUT NOT JUST ANY FAMILY -- SOUNDS 
LIKE A FAMILY SPIKE KNOWS PRETTY WELL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Spike Lee's father, Bill, stands at the oven on the first floor of his 
brownstone in Fort Greene, cooking a noontime breakfast for his young son 
Arnold, shooing away some of their 19 cats, and talking about his family -- 
about everyone except Spike Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks about his great-great-great-grandfather Mike, the defiant son of an 
African king, and his great-great-great-grandmother Phoebe, who was taken from 
her mother in Africa when she was 9. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks about his grandfather William James Edwards, descendant of Mike and 
Phoebe, an educator who went to school with Booker T. Washington; " I went to 
school with Martin Luther King," he adds. Then he talks about his father and 
mother, his sisters and brothers, all -- like himself -- trained musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Bill talks about the children of his first marriage, who each also 
started out playing music -- David, piano; Joy, bass; Cinque, drums; Chris, 
trumpet, and Spike, cello. 
</P>
<P>
 "David got interested in photography," he begins, "Joy got interested in 
acting; she's also a dancer and a singer. Cinque got interested in writing; 
he's also an actor. Chris became interested in art; he's still an artist, but 
he hasn't pursued it." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointedly leaves out his oldest son, Spike. He says, when asked, that he 
has no idea what Spike's new movie is about, even though it is a movie he in a 
real sense spawned; even though he scored his son's first four films. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything to do with Spike now," he says of troubles between the 
two, which included the elder Lee's arrest for heroin possession in 1991 and 
subsequent request to his son for a loan -- which was refused -- in early 1992. 
"We haven't talked for two years." 
</P>
<P>
 "Crooklyn," Spike Lee's seventh film, which opens May 13, focuses on a family 
with a daughter and four sons growing up in a Brooklyn brownstone in the 1970s. 
The father is a jazz musician, the mother a schoolteacher, their car, a Citroen 
station wagon. The Lee family arrived in Brooklyn from the South when the 
eldest, Shelton Jackson -- Spike -- was a toddler. The Lees, who drove a 
Citroen station wagon, soon numbered one daughter and four sons, who did much 
of their growing up in the 1970s. Father Bill Lee plays jazz bass. Mother 
Jacquelyn Shelton taught art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things are based on our family," Cinque Lee, 27, the youngest of the 
four sons, concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very, very, very loosely based," says Spike Lee, 37. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the same question, their brother David, 33, simply falls silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Their sister, who now calls herself Joie, 31, says as little as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The four of them are spending the summer of '93 making their movie together in 
the Bedford-Stuyvesant section, outside an elegant brownstone on Arlington 
Place -- a block chosen to be the set for the film because of its Brooklyn 
neighborly feel, a brownstone chosen because of its resemblance to the one, 
some three subway stops away, where the Lee children all grew up, where Bill 
Lee still lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crooklyn" is a family picture, in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave birth to this project; Spike delivered it," says Joie. Joie, the only 
girl in the family, wrote the screenplay, which tells the story through the 
eyes of the only girl, Troy. Her co-writer (in addition to Spike, who joined 
the process later) was her brother Cinque, who is also her partner in a company 
they named Child Hoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wrote the script for ourselves," Cinque says. "Then we showed Spike and he 
said, 'Hey, I'll do it.' We were surprised; we didn't think he'd be 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
 But he was. "After 'Malcolm X,' he wanted a rest," Cinque says. "I'm sure he 
wanted to do something light, that didn't ruffle any feathers." 
</P>
<P>
 "My little brother doesn't know what he's talking about," Spike replies, 
clearly still willing to ruffle feathers, at least in his own nest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would've killed me to do a film like 'Malcolm X' right afterward," Spike 
Lee was saying. "So the script of 'Crooklyn,' you know, really fit. Because of 
the scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most everything about "Crooklyn" is on a scale less than half that of 
"Malcolm X." "X" cost about $35 million for an 80-day shoot; "Crooklyn" was 
budgeted for $15 million and was shot in 52 days last summer. "Malcolm X," 
which was filmed here, in Africa and in the Middle East, took about two years 
to make, swept through 40 years in the life of a historic figure, and employed 
200 actors with speaking parts, more than 400 crew members and tens of 
thousands of extras. "Crooklyn," which stars Alfre Woodard and Delroy Lindo as 
the parents, covers about six months in the life of a family and their 
neighbors on one block in Brooklyn, with time out for a trip to Maryland 
(filmed in New Jersey). 
</P>
<P>
 Spike and his producers say that "Crooklyn" is not really a departure; it is a 
return to the scale of all the films he made before "Malcolm X." 
</P>
<P>
 But the scale is not all that is different. "Crooklyn" is "neither angry nor 
confrontational . . . nobody will feel alienated in this one," Spike himself 
said in March, 1993 -- despite his belittling of his brother Cinque for saying 
much the same thing on the set. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brooklyn of "Crooklyn," though filmed in the same neighborhood, is far 
from the literally explosive terrain of 1989's "Do the Right Thing." Lee gained 
notoriety in that movie for the character he played who throws a garbage can 
through the window of Sal's Famous Pizzeria, sparking a riot in which the 
business burns to the ground. There were several fiery scenes in "Malcolm X" as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Crooklyn," the Lees filmed another scene of smoke and screams and chaos, 
of a father gathering up his hysterical children. This time, though, it was an 
oven exploding in the kitchen. The scene, which did not make it into the film's 
final version, was a true event in the Lee family history. 
</P>
<P>
 David, a photographer who has been working for his oldest brother "since I was 
11," recalled the real-life incident vividly. "My eyebrows were singed off," he 
said, then noticed his listener's attention on his brow. "I'm wearing 
prosthetic eyebrows," he added, arching them. 
</P>
<P>
 Spike does not remember the incident quite as distinctly, but he admits, " 
'Crooklyn' is the Brooklyn of my youth" -- a 1970 of dancing to "Soul Train" 
and singing along with "The Partridge Family," of miniskirts and platform 
shoes, of Curtis Mayfield and the Jackson Five, all shown in the nostalgic 
tints of a 1970 Ebony. "I'm not going to say that this was the age of 
innocence. But you know . . . the worst thing you had when I was growing up was 
the glue sniffers." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many films featuring African Americans, Lee said, " 'Crooklyn' is not 
about a dysfunctional family, where the mom is a crack-head." But the film does 
feature some lowlifes, including one named Snuffy (played by Spike), who sniff 
glue. Criticized for leaving out the drugs from the world of "Do the Right 
Thing," Lee put drugs in both "Jungle Fever" and "Malcolm X," though he left 
them out of 1990's "Mo' Better Blues," a film about a jazz musician -- the last 
of Spike's films scored by his father, and the one in which Bill Lee appears in 
a cameo at the end. A year after that film's release, Bill Lee was arrested in 
a Brooklyn park police sweep on suspicion of possession of heroin. (The case 
was eventually dismissed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Spike won't talk about his father, but Cinque credits Bill Lee with inspiring 
"Crooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were growing up, our father had a name for everybody on the block," 
Cinque recalls, sitting on a stoop in Arlington Place. " 'Conk,' because his 
hair was conked. 'Slide,' because he wore slippers, and he would always slide 
when he walked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still live in the same neighborhood -- that's a Brooklyn thing -- and we 
hear about the neighbors: 'Slide got a new dog.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was from that, Cinque says, that "Crooklyn" was born. He and Joie decided 
to create some 35 characters, mostly from their old block. "It's hard to 
remember which were real characters and which were fictional." 
</P>
<P>
 As he speaks, some studious children play Scrabble nearby; a 5-year-old adds 
an "s" to "exam." Not far away, Eulalie Richards talks about the history of the 
block, how in 1947 when she moved in "there were still five white people on the 
block." Now she is 93, and the block is full of large families, many from 
Barbados. "Everybody here's very tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Two young men are strutting down the street, oblivious of the rain-making 
machines, the sky-high lighting, the huge trailers, the fat coils of wire 
crowding the street. "You have five apples and 12 people," one young man says 
to the other. "How do you give each person an equal share?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You cut it." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you can't cut it."  
</P>
<P>
 They turn the next corner, as he supplies the solution: "You make applesauce." 
These are scenes from the neighborhood, not the film, part of the normal swirl 
of a Brooklyn block. Only the Scrabble players are actors in "Crooklyn," 
waiting for their summons to the camera. Cinque looks very much at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wrote it as a television series for children," he says. But Nickelodeon 
screened a pilot for the series, had it tested with a group of inner-city kids, 
and gave it thumbs down. "It had no hip-hop music, no dancing. It had jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Not wanting to waste the characters, Joie and Cinque put many of them in a 
film script. As they wrote -- faxing pages back and forth, even though they 
live two blocks from each other -- they narrowed their focus further and 
further, first on a neighborhood, then on one block, then on one family, 
finally on one character (the girl, Troy). The resulting film, Cinque said, is 
"95%" from their imagination, although they had a hard time persuading even the 
crew of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one scene, a dog gets caught in a sofa bed and dies," Cinque says. "And 
people kept on coming up and saying" -- he mimics shock and outrage -- " 'Did 
you really kill that dog?' It's a fictional movie!"  
</P>
<P>
 But there are scenes that even his siblings admit are based on their 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, while a camera crowds a small bedroom on the second floor covered with 
basketball posters, Alfre Woodard talks to a young actor named Carlton 
Williams, who plays the oldest boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton, you're the eldest and I expect more from you," she says while 
Clinton sits on his bed, pouting. "I'm going to let you make your own 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did Daddy have to have his concert tonight?" Clinton says. "The same 
exact night of the seventh game of the NBA championship. The Knicks and the 
Lakers -- and I got tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll make the right decision," his mother says. "Which is more important? 
Your father or the Knicks?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely remember that," Spike Lee says later. "That was the seventh game 
of the NBA championship in 1970; that's the game that Willis Reed dragged his 
leg on the court and the Knicks beat the Lakers. I got one ticket for the game, 
I got it through my father's lawyer . . . who lives down the block, who went to 
school with John Havlicek." Lee tells the story with great detail and 
animation, which brings to mind a line he used to tell interviewers: "When I 
was a kid, I wanted to be a basketball player, but I stopped growing." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no such details about his father's concert, making it clear which 
choice he made. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he regret it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unfortunate my father had to schedule a concert . . . but I mean, 
there would be other concerts; it was only going to be this one championship 
game. But it . . . I think it hurt (my father). I think it hurt very much. 
Shoot, when my sister did (the musical) 'Mule Bone' on Broadway, their opening 
night was a night the Chicago Bulls were in town. You know where I was at." 
</P>
<P>
 If, as Spike Lee likes to say, "it's a scientific fact that a child's 
character is formed by about 5, 6 years old," what kind of child would he cast 
to play himself? 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone real quiet," he answers. "You know, very observant, but real quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 And difficult? Stubborn? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that I've been stubborn at times, but I think that any artist has to 
be stubborn." If at age 37 Spike Lee continues playing the rebellious child -- 
the arrogant older brother, the stubborn son -- he seems to have taken on some 
new roles as well. You could even say that he is a family man now, having 
married Washington lawyer Tanya Lynette Lewis in October. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also, metaphorically at least, a father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crooklyn" marks the first time he actually has had to discipline his lead 
actors, most of whom are children. Few are professional (professional child 
actors "stink . . . they're not natural," the director says), many recruited 
from local schools throughout the boroughs. During the shoot, "a lot of time 
was spent playing parent: 'Shut up, sit down, why you doin' that? Stop it! Why 
you hittin'?' Stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has also played father in a way as a filmmaker, mentor to members of a 
younger generation who see him as the grand old trailblazer, even though his 
first professional film, "She's Gotta Have It," debuted a mere eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But in that time black directors have come into their own, including John 
Singleton, the Hudlin brothers, Mario Van Peebles and Ernest Dickerson 
("Juice"), Lee's cinematographer since film school; "Crooklyn" is the first 
movie Lee has made without him. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have called this a renaissance in black filmmaking. Lee's reaction: "The 
door's cracked; it's not wide open." 
</P>
<P>
 He takes his mentor role seriously, proud of the careers his films have 
launched, including those of Wesley Snipes, Rosie Perez, Martin Lawrence and 
John Turturro. He has also taught film at Harvard, and offers every spring term 
a kind of film institute at Long Island University, open to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been about the demystification of film," he explains. "I think 
that's what keeps people -- in particular minorities and women -- from entering 
the film industry. This whole hocus-pocus aura they try to put around 
filmmaking, the Hollywood magic, that's just to make it seem inaccessible to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has become a serious businessman as well, not only with his own film 
company, but with three Spike's Joint stores selling promotional jackets, caps, 
T-shirts and books; a music company; a management company for athletes; a 
soon-to-open advertising agency that will be a joint venture with BBDO 
Worldwide. He's even become a Brooklyn landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 All this authority, some people have reasoned, must be making Spike Lee more 
mellow; they use as evidence his relatively restrained reaction when "Malcolm 
X" failed to get Oscar nominations for anything but best actor and best costume 
designer, and won neither. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said more than my share about the Academy Awards," he says now, in his 
Fort Greene office, a converted firehouse decorated with huge posters of his 
films. "People know how I feel. So why should I keep wasting energy about it?" 
But then he launches into it once again, winding up with his review of the 
relative merits of 1989 winner "Driving Miss Daisy" and 1989 reject "Do the 
Right Thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Why does he think so many of his films cause such a ruckus? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the agenda that I stir up controversy," he says. "At least I try 
to make thought-provoking films." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his own work, he looks forward to making "musicals, romantic films, all 
kinds of films." Including thrillers: His next film is "Clockers," based on the 
gritty Richard Price novel about cops and drug dealers in New Jersey. The 
executive producer is Spike's idol Martin Scorsese. 
</P>
<P>
 In each new film he expects the cast and crew to form a kind of family. "Some 
films are good family. Some films are bad families. But you definitely have 
family. Family does happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Family and music seem to be the central themes of Bill Lee's life, yet he has 
stopped talking about a particular member of his family. "I can't dwell on 
that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not even our son anymore," says Lee's son (and Spike's half-brother) 
Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been a Spike Lee fan," says Susan Kaplan-Lee, Bill's wife, wearing 
a "Do the Right Thing" jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict began when Susan started living with Bill shortly after Jacquelyn 
died in 1976 -- when "my mother wasn't even cold in her grave," Spike has put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 It grew during production of Spike's "Jungle Fever," about an interracial 
relationship: "That's directly talking about me and my wife," Bill says, with 
some heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Then early in 1992, Bill has said, he asked his son for a few thousand dollars 
to help pay his household bills; Spike turned him down, "and his attitude was 
very insulting." ("Why should I dignify comments my father said," Spike Lee 
replies, "or play it out in a public forum?") 
</P>
<P>
 The loan request came not long after Bill's drug bust; did drug use contribute 
to the split? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lee says no. "I'm glad I was arrested. It woke me up. . . . Dope was not 
part of my life until I was 40 years old," adds Lee, now 65, which means he 
started getting involved with heroin when his children were young, around the 
time his wife was dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this, he says, is insignificant. "People remember you by the work that 
you do." And Bill Lee, like his oldest son, has often used his life experiences 
as a source for his seven folk jazz operas. One of them, "Little Johnny," is 
about the purchase of the Lee family home in Fort Greene that is the setting of 
"Crooklyn." "It has old people and kids and a story," he says vaguely. It 
doesn't have conflict. "In all these operas, I never think about no conflict."

THE LABORS OF JOHN GARAMENDI; THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND 
GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE IS HARD-WORKING AND AMBITIOUS. MAYBE TOO AMBITIOUS.

<P>
 In the windowless lunch room of the Hi-Ridge Lumber Co. on the outskirts of 
Yreka, a small group of dust-covered sawmill workers sits around scarred picnic 
tables. They don't care much for politicians -- especially the ones in 
Sacramento, who seem to cater mostly to the strange and distant problems of 
urban California -- so they're disconcerted to find themselves spending their 
dinner hour with one. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor, who essentially invited himself, is state Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi, 49, Democrat and iconoclastic candidate for governor. Garamendi 
coils his lanky denim-clad frame on a corner of one table and introduces 
himself, then asks for questions. There are no TV cameras, no campaign word 
spinners, no banners or fund-raising envelopes. And no bull. Not, at least, 
from the dour workers as they pick through brown bags and dinner buckets.  
</P>
<P>
 "What can the governor's office do for us?" one worker demands. Hi-Ridge is a 
survivor, so far, in a timber industry that is succumbing to owls, imports and 
other forces -- mostly government bureaucrats, the way the workers see it. If 
they are skeptical of politicians in general, these hunters and outdoorsmen are 
particular scornful of those who talk, as Garamendi does, about gun controls 
and protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 As he launches into a discourse on forestry, environmental balance, sustained 
yield, computer-monitored laser-beam saws and the export of California logs to 
Japan, the men hunch over their sandwiches. If not for Garamendi's imposing 
physical presence, he might've lost them entirely. He carries his trim 215 
pounds erect on his 6-foot-2 frame. His dark hair shows no gray, his blue eyes 
are intense, and his hands, massive even for such a large man, slice the air to 
punctuate his points.  
</P>
<P>
 He moves on to the reform of workers' compensation insurance to reduce rates 
at high-risk places like sawmills. He says that health-care reform -- he has 
his own plan, of course -- would free up the capital that Hi-Ridge would need 
to modernize its plant. Then, closing the circle, he says, "You can maintain 
your productivity here, compete, and you guys keep your jobs. Or, alternately, 
you can go debate (higher) wages." He grins at Hi-Ridge vice president Gerald 
Bendix, sitting off in a corner.  
</P>
<P>
 "Providing we can get jobs," a doubting mill hand says. 
</P>
<P>
 "That too," Garamendi says, flashing a smile. A grudging burst of laughter 
breaks the tension. "Can't solve everything in one evening," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but Garamendi tries. He fields questions and offers proposals on 
crime (the "three-strikes" law, licensing of handguns, boot camps for young 
offenders), job retraining, restructuring the work force, overhauling the 
school system, putting California onto the information superhighway and 
invigorating the economy by converting aerospace plants to new transportation 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the lunch boxes snap shut, crumpled bags are slam-dunked into the trash 
barrel, and Garamendi, in hard hat, gloves and apron, joins the workers on the 
saw lines. With the campaign slogan "Working for California," he's pledging to 
work in every one of California's 58 counties by the June 7 primary, and he'll 
add his sawmill day to his growing list of odd jobs: clerk at a hardware store 
in Weaverville, crowbar wielder on an L.A. city street-repair crew, grocery 
bagger at a Safeway store in Fairfield. 
</P>
<P>
 When he leaves the mill after 11 p.m., he is as sawdust-grimy as the others 
and as bouncy as a kid with a new bike. His proposals didn't seem to impress 
the workers too much, mill official Bendix says later, but that he should come 
and work at the mill and share their lunchtime, he adds, "that made an 
impression." 
</P>
<P>
 The workday photo op is a poor man's tactic, the sort of gimmick an underdog 
uses to get free publicity. Even Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, 
says the candidate could meet more voters by standing in front of Garamendi 
state headquarters on Sunset Boulevard for an hour. And he could raise more 
money by spending that hour on the telephone with prospective campaign donors. 
With rival State Treasurer Kathleen Brown sitting on some $4 million (to 
Garamendi's $58,000, as of the March reports) and a hefty lead in the opinion 
polls, working the phones means survival. (State Sen. Tom Hayden, a Democrat 
from Santa Monica, also a candidate, acknowledges he has no chance of winning.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow does not like Garamendi's workdays. But the candidate is keeping his 
own counsel, as he always has. And the idea of real, physical labor is at the 
core of his upbringing, his character and -- even if it undermines it -- his 
campaign. The product of a Basque-Irish-Italian mining and ranching family 
(Garamendi means "fiery mountain" in Basque), he insists that working alongside 
people is the only way a governor can really understand California. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other new-idea politicians (Gary Hart, Bill Clinton) before him, 
Garamendi believes problems must be attacked forcefully on the ground level. 
Communities must come together, pitch in and make things better. Put everyone 
in the room and hammer out a solution -- without getting dissipated and lost in 
gridlocked committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Such circumvention of conventional politics also allows the 20-year 
state-government veteran to run as an outsider. That may not be as 
contradictory as it seems; Garamendi has worked outside the system even while 
he has been in it, a quality that does not endear him to all his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring the old notion of stroking allies and paying your dues, he often 
seems to be elbowing his way to the front of the line. "He was always working 
for the best interest of John Garamendi, with political gain in mind," observes 
state Sen. Robert G. Beverly, a Republican from Long Beach and a Garamendi 
Senate colleague for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Garamendi is a supremely self-confident man who always has 
charted an independent course. "I don't care about the political risk," he 
says. "I win it or lose it, I want to attack the problem." His way. 
</P>
<P>
 IT WAS A LITTLE EXPERIMENT ON THE PART OF CALAVERAS HIGH SCHOOL teacher John 
Lodato one day back in the early 1960s, when one of his honor students was a 
burly ranch kid named John Garamendi.  
</P>
<P>
 Lodato went into the classroom, took roll, and then, he recalls, "I just went 
to the back of the room and sat down. After about five minutes or so of 
low-order chaos, John takes over and gets the class organized, and they do a 
certain amount of activity related to the curriculum. . . . I had a hunch that 
John was the type of kid who would not be willing to just sit there and see the 
class do nothing." Garamendi, says Lodato, now running a tennis club in San 
Andreas, always stood out as a leader. 
</P>
<P>
 John Raymond Garamendi grew up the second of seven children on a ranch two 
miles from the Gold Rush town of Mokelumne Hill in the Sierra foothills. For 
John, often in tandem with brother Tom, nearly a year and a half older, boyhood 
in California's Mother Lode was bucolic. He remembers Little League, Boy 
Scouts, milkshakes at the town soda fountain, almost-straight-A report cards, 
being class president at Calaveras High.  
</P>
<P>
 In the summers, there was backpacking in the nearby Sierra with his father, 
Raymond, a local civic leader. They skied in the winter and branded calves in 
spring. And when he and Tom got crosswise with their dad, there was some 
serious digging of postholes in the rocky ground of the Mother Lode. 
</P>
<P>
 "You lived your values, the value of hard work," says Garamendi. "Stay with it 
until it's done. 'When that hole is 32 inches deep, then you can quit, Son. I 
don't care how hard the rock is. You've got to set the post properly.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to relatives and friends from Moke Hill, as they call it locally, and you 
get stories tinged with Norman Rockwell. They recall the time John pulled a man 
from a burning building while on his way home from school. And they tell of 
pranks. Such as the time Tom and John built a fort to end all forts, burrowing 
out tunnels within the bales of hay stacked in the barn for feeding the stock 
through the winter and spring months. "It was not just a big hole," recalls Tom 
Garamendi, who is maintenance supervisor at the prison in nearby Ione. "It was 
a major chasm. We'd taken everything out, and we'd made supports of timbers and 
large pipes and everything."  
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, Ray Garamendi inventoried the hay to make sure he'd have enough 
bales to feed the cattle when needed, and there seemed to be plenty. So it came 
as a rude surprise when he removed some bales the following year to find "there 
was nothing but air down there," Tom says. "I am sure that we were grounded," 
he adds, "not because of what we did, but because we didn't bother telling 
him."  
</P>
<P>
 Like his father, who died almost three years ago, John is a strapping fellow 
with a jaw so squarely chiseled he brings to mind Dudley Do-Right, the 
stiff-backed Mountie of the Bullwinkle cartoons. As a star athlete, the 
one-on-one nature of wrestling particularly appealed to him. "It was what you 
could do yourself," he recalls. "You find out how good you were right away. If 
you made a mistake, it was all yours" -- a template for the way he'd play 
politics years later. 
</P>
<P>
 When Garamendi was 18 and a tackle on the UC Berkeley football team, President 
John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Kennedy had been the hero of Garamendi and 
his girlfriend, Patricia Wilkinson, a 19-year-old music and education major 
from Watsonville, and his death changed their discussions about their future. 
</P>
<P>
 In their senior year, they were married and enjoyed a surprise honeymoon in 
Hawaii when Garamendi was picked to play in the Hula Bowl college all-star 
game. They debated whether John should go on to business school as planned or, 
possibly, play professional football; there were feelers from both the Oakland 
Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys. But then Patti brought up the idea of joining 
Kennedy's Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jane Garamendi, 73, recalls a spring day in 1966 when John and Patti came 
home for a visit before getting their degrees. "They said, 'We're going to 
Ethiopia.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Where is Ethopia? Oh gosh, that's so far away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 John Garamendi was 21 years old and had never been beyond Mexico when a creaky 
World War II C-47 transport left him and Patti in a pasture in southwestern 
Ethiopia -- "about as far from anywhere as you could get," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 They lived in a mud hut, without running water or electricity, in the village 
of Mettu, and for the next two years taught the village children English, math 
and other subjects, with John using his ranching skills to organize local 
improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw everything," Garamendi says. "We saw people next to us die because 
they were sick." They responded systematically. "We'd find some task that could 
be done rather simply and quickly, and we'd fix that, so there'd be a success." 
That lesson, of using small successes to build experience and to motivate the 
community to solve more complex problems, is one he applies broadly. In 
Ethiopia, he worked with the villagers first to develop a water well, then a 
bridge across a stream to its school and, later, plumbing, electricity and 
improvements in the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 And he carries a similar approach to problem solving into his campaign for 
governor. After the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, Garamendi quickly -- and 
with considerable political risk, some experts thought -- called for temporary 
increases in the state sales and gasoline taxes to repair the damage. 
California could not afford to sit back and wait, as Gov. Pete Wilson was 
inclined, to see just how much of the bill would be paid by the federal 
government, he said. The money was not as important as the idea of Californians 
joining together to work toward a common goal, to overcome the Golden State's 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very clear about this business of this tax," he said before the 
Legislature opted, instead, to put a bond issue on the June ballot. "It's a 
very important test of the spirit, of the capabilities of the community. It's 
like building that bridge to the school (in Ethiopia). The community got 
together. . . ." They did it. And that empowered them to do something else. And 
so it is here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ethiopia. It changed everything," Garamendi adds. "It just intensified 
everything and has remained the pivotal point in our lives."  
</P>
<P>
 GARAMENDI'S POLITICAL OPPONENTS MIGHT CHUCKLE TO LEARN THAT HE lost his first 
big election when he ran against his best friend for president of the Calaveras 
High student body. Compared with the stakes of being governor of the nation's 
largest state in 1994, it was more of a social honor, says the winner, Erle 
Winkler of San Andreas, a realtor and owner of a health food store in San 
Andreas.  
</P>
<P>
 There were no hard feelings, Winkler says. "It was a friendly campaign." In a 
later election for senior class president, Garamendi emerged as the winner.  
</P>
<P>
 It was not the last time that Garamendi kept on running after a loss. In 1982, 
after just eight years in the Legislature, he was swamped in a premature bid 
for the Democratic nomination for governor, losing to then-L.A. Mayor Tom 
Bradley. He lost a shot at state controller four years later. And after he had 
worked his way into the state Senate's controlling Democratic hierarchy to 
become majority leader, he was dumped by his colleagues. They argued that 
Garamendi spent too much time nurturing his own political ambitions and not 
enough attending to fund-raising for fellow party members. 
</P>
<P>
 An even more serious miscalculation was his abortive effort to replace a 
fellow Democrat as the top Senate officer, president pro tem, in January of 
1986. Garamendi tipped reporters the night before his planned coup, and word 
got back to Senate chief David A. Roberti, who rallied his own forces. When 
Garamendi moved the following day to elect himself to the top job, he got 
nobody's vote but his own.  
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi had risen quickly in the Senate because he was smart, hard-working 
and productive, veteran Sacramento observers agree. But they also claim that he 
repeatedly was tripped up by his ambition to jump to higher office too quickly, 
particularly when he tried to leap over Roberti, who had been something of a 
mentor to him in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ambition keeps getting in the way of his pragmatic judgment," Roberti 
said after the vote. State Sen. Diane E. Watson, a Democrat from Los Angeles 
and a Garamendi supporter, says that Garamendi, while a whiz at policy, tends 
to rush into situations. "He worked, I guess, in a very rapid way and probably 
was ahead of a lot of people," she says. "But you know, it doesn't do you any 
good unless you're sure people are following you on these things. I think he's 
learning that." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, who has dealt in some fashion with virtually every major state 
issue over the past two decades, is not shy about taking credit for his policy 
successes, another quality that irks his colleagues. At a senior center in 
Crescent City, he volunteers that he wrote the bond act that provided the money 
to remodel the building. Talking about putting welfare recipients to work, he 
says, "The reason I'm familiar with that program is that I wrote the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The health-care debate in Washington? "Based on a program I developed here in 
California," he says. "Hillary substantially improved it. Bill will do his best 
not to screw it up, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary and Bill? Oh yes. John and Patti Garamendi are friends of the First 
Couple. Garamendi was Clinton's California campaign chairman in 1992. His 
health-care plan did, in fact, serve as the basis for development of the 
Clinton program. Patti Garamendi has been appointed to the No. 3 job in the 
U.S. Peace Corps in the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's foes complain that he's too good to be true, yet many acknowledge 
that he does have a broader vision than most. In 1986, just as personal 
computers were becoming popular, he issued a report emphasizing the importance 
to California of new technology and information systems. Before it became a 
common political buzzword, he wrote a report on competitiveness. He argued, as 
he still does, that California cannot afford to abandon its manufacturing base 
and become a total service economy. 
</P>
<P>
 This immersion in public policy and politics after his return from Ethiopia 
was something of a natural progression for Garamendi, although it almost didn't 
happen. In 1970, after earning his MBA from Harvard, he started working in the 
international finance department of the Bank of America in San Francisco, but 
concerns about taking his young family abroad again -- by then, the Garamendis 
had two children -- derailed his international business plans. Instead, the 
family moved to Calaveras County, where John went into real estate development 
and became involved in local affairs -- building a park in Mokelumne Hill and 
working to protect farmland from development. The Garamendis also helped to 
organize a Democratic caucus in their new Assembly district, established under 
reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was a new seat, there was no one with the built-in advantage of 
incumbency. With the help of another active young Democrat in the area, Pat 
Johnston, the Garamendis put together a winning campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "John was a comer, immediately a striking candidate," recalls Johnston, who 
followed Garamendi into the Assembly and the Senate. "He brought a dynamism and 
a sort of optimism -- idealism really -- that most people don't convey even 
when they're trying to." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to assess Garamendi's assets and flaws, he pauses and thinks carefully. 
"His ambition has never been hidden or disguised," Johnston says in his state 
Senate office in Sacramento. "There's no false humility. And he believes that 
he's the best one to do whatever the next political position is that might be 
available -- governor and probably President of the United States. I've never 
heard him talk about it, but that's how he views himself." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not one to let the world go by," says Garamendi. "I take an active role 
in what I do and sometimes that rubs people the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi served one two-year term in the Assembly and moved on to the state 
Senate in 1976, again when there was no incumbent running. 
</P>
<P>
 After his Senate career, Garamendi finally won a statewide office in 1990, 
becoming California's first insurance commissioner. In the high-profile race 
for enforcer of the insurance rebates promised in Proposition 103, he pledged 
to ensure that the promised $2 billion in rebates was returned to voters. Since 
then, a conglomerate of three insurance companies agreed to pay a $500,000 fine 
for redlining in San Francisco and Los Angeles, thanks to pressure from 
Garamendi. And by this year, rebates to 6 million California policyholders 
totaled $832 million, according to figures provided by Proposition 103 author 
Harvey Rosenfield. Many of the major companies are still fighting rebates in 
the courts, along with virtually every other Garamendi initiative to regulate 
the industry more strictly.  
</P>
<P>
 But auto liability rates have been stabilized, averaging $518 a year in 1992, 
compared with $519 in 1989, Rosenfield says, while rates increased by 20% in 
the rest of the country during that time. Rosenfield did not support 
Garamendi's election in 1990, viewing him as too much of a pro-business 
moderate and fearing that he would not be tough enough on the insurance 
industry. But "it didn't turn out that way at all," he says. "I think he's 
really tried hard to make 103 work and keep rates low." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's insurance-industry foes generally label him as a publicity-hungry 
demagogue who rushes prematurely into an action primarily for its headline 
value. He, in turn, calls them "pigs at the trough" who care more about their 
profits than their policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputes the fact, however, that the insurance commissioner's job was 
an ideal platform for launching Garamendi's next run for the brass ring. 
</P>
<P>
 ON SEPT. 3, 1990, JOHN GARAMENDI DID SOMETHING ALMOST UNHEARD OF in politics. 
He resigned his state Senate office two months before he would know if he would 
win the office he was seeking: state insurance commissioner. This time, 
Garamendi's actions seemed to have nothing to do with his own political 
ambition. But they did have something -- perhaps everything -- to do with the 
political ambitions of his wife, Patti. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi argued that by resigning when he did, the governor could schedule 
the special election to fill his Senate seat -- which had two years to run -- 
to coincide with the general election. That would save the $500,000 cost of a 
separate special election, he said -- and his salary as state senator. But few 
bought Garamendi's argument because they knew one of the candidates for 
Garamendi's seat would be his wife. Another was Garamendi's old political 
sidekick Pat Johnston, who would now be in something of a box. Johnston wanted 
the Senate job, but it was too late for him to remove his name from the ballot 
for reelection to his Assembly seat. So he faced voter confusion over which 
seat he was running for, as he was now forced to seek both. This gave Patti 
Garamendi a distinct advantage, but Johnston won anyway, with 35% of the vote 
to Patti's 26%.  
</P>
<P>
 If political critics view John Garamendi as a little glib, a little too 
effusive, many see Patti Garamendi as even more so. Also tall (about 
5-foot-10), blond, blue-eyed and energetic, she has always been an activist, 
she says. "From the time I was 10 years old, my dad said I was just a born 
do-gooder. I don't know if he meant it positively or not, but I couldn't help 
myself."  
</P>
<P>
 And in politics, she is irrepressible. Johnston's victory not only failed to 
discourage her, it created a fresh opportunity. Johnson's Senate victory opened 
up his Assembly seat, setting the stage for a new round of special elections to 
fill that post. Patti ran for the Assembly and lost in May, 1991, to 
conservative Republican Dean Andal. Still another opportunity arose in 1992 -- 
a new congressional district created by reapportionment. Patti ran for that 
U.S. House seat, too. She lost again, narrowly, to the Republican mayor of 
Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento Bee columnist Dan Walters wrote what many California political 
observers were thinking: "Despite their attractive public personalities, the 
Garamendis' political endeavors have always been plagued by their 
self-contained insularity . . . and a reputation . . . for self-serving 
machinations." 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is whether Patti's three tries for office not only cost 
Garamendi goodwill among political insiders but also campaign donations from 
those the couple has repeatedly solicited. Patti Garamendi says she has no 
regrets about losing three times in two years. The losses, after all, yielded a 
gain in the form of her Peace Corps job. "I wouldn't be where I am today if I 
hadn't had the courage to step out there as an individual and offer my skills 
for service," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 If John Garamendi is elected, Patti says, California would get more than an 
executive partnership on the order of Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
-- it would be electing an entire First Family. Eldest daughter Genet, 25, is a 
political assistant to a California congressman. John Jr., 23, travels as 
Garamendi's aide-de-camp and friend. Daughters Christina, 21, and Autumn, 18, 
UC Davis students, are leaders in an international environmental organization 
and helped establish programs within a Bosnia refugee camp last year. Merle, 
who is 13 and prefers to use her middle name, Elizabeth, and Ashley, 7, live in 
Washington most of the time with their mother, who says that despite their 
bicoastal living arrangement, she and John "remain totally connected."  
</P>
<P>
 Johnston, choosing his words carefully, says he believes John and Patti 
Garamendi constitute "a core consultation unit that is very exclusive. . . . 
It's never been particularly important to John what other people thought of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 As a new legislator, Garamendi commuted regularly to the Assembly in 
Sacramento, returning to Calaveras County over a twisting two-lane road to be 
with his family in the evenings rather than schmooze with other legislators who 
maintained second homes in the capital. Eventually, the Garamendis moved closer 
in, to a 1920s farm house near Walnut Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was always there," says Genet, never missing a recital, a school play, 
a graduation or the other important events of childhood. "He would make 
breakfast for us every morning." Though even her friends are skeptical, she 
insists that there is no dark side beneath a happy facade. 
</P>
<P>
 A standing joke in California political circles is the annual Garamendi 
Christmas card, showing the family and, sometimes, a surprise guest, in an 
idyllic scene from the ranch or on the beach. The 1992 card included Bill 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing new about a politician using a family photo on a Christmas 
card. But the Garamendis come in for ribbing perhaps because there are so many 
of them, all so handsome, with, sometimes, a schmaltzy message. In the 1992 
card, John wrote, "We seize each day and squeeze from it its fullest, thanking 
God for what has been given. Like the special evening in the photo when our new 
president joined us for dinner at Walnut Grove." 
</P>
<P>
 The Garamendis know that some make fun of their cards. In fact, Sragow picked 
up on it in issues of his "Garamendi Gram," a periodic newsletter to reporters 
and political insiders. The Dec. 10 Garamendi Gram proclaimed: "They're on 
their way! The 1993 Garamendi family Holiday Greetings will soon be available 
in mailboxes all over California." And the 1993 version also would include a 
surprise guest, Sragow said. "See if you can guess who joins the Garamendis 
this year (pick one): Boris Yeltsin, Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, Ringo Starr, 
Elvis Presley, Martin Kurtovich, Pat Brown, Dave Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner would get to spend one day fund raising for Garamendi. All losers 
would have to take the winner's call. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was Kurtovich, Genet's husband. The only winners were Garamendi 
staff members, who already were dialing for contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 BACK IN MID-1993, THE PREDICTIONS for California's gubernatorial election went 
like this: Republican Gov. Pete Wilson was in the tank, Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown would be anointed with the Democratic nomination in June, and she'd 
probably roll over Wilson in November. And John Garamendi? Well, if he weren't 
so blinded by political ambition, he would settle for a second term or get his 
friend Bill Clinton to give him a job.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the dynamic of the campaign is far from last summer's forecast. Wilson 
has returned from the political dead zone, Garamendi is plodding along to his 
own campaign script, and people are wondering why Brown's campaign seems to be 
stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 60, started poll vaulting with a productive 1993 legislative session, 
by exploiting voter anger over illegal immigration and by hammering away on the 
issue of violent crime. And his constant visibility during last fall's brush 
fires and following the Jan. 17 earthquake gave him more media exposure than at 
any time since he was elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion polls still harbor danger signs for Wilson. But by April, his 
popularity with voters had rebounded to near-respectable levels. He trailed in 
mythical matchups with Brown by 10 points and Garamendi by 5 in the latest Los 
Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The glitter around the candidacy of the 48-year-old Brown began to fade in 
late 1993. Critics and some supporters began to question how much substance 
there was behind Brown's family political tradition, her telegenic stardom and 
her fund-raising acumen. She countered with a series of policy speeches, but 
they were criticized as failing to convey any overriding vision. 
</P>
<P>
 By this spring, her campaign remained on cautious cruise control, so flat and 
listless that some political commentators began writing that Brown seemed 
unable to articulate why she wanted to be governor, or what she would do if 
elected. She was rarely on the stump and dodged Garamendi's constant demands to 
debate. Then in March, Brown hired consultant Clint Reilly to replace her 
campaign management team.  
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has not exactly taken California by storm, but he is making inroads. 
He blocked Brown from winning endorsement by the giant California Teachers 
Assn. and won the support of Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, 
California's most prominent Latina politician. But through early April, most of 
this was insider stuff. The California electorate, increasingly distrustful of 
politicians and distracted by economic hard times, violent crime and an 
earthquake, was not yet focusing on the election. Garamendi's job -- as 
Garamendi, Sragow, and many political experts see it -- is to find some way to 
directly confront Brown and allow voters to see what they believe is his 
superior grasp of the issues.  
</P>
<P>
 That most likely will take a series of televised debates, and people 
interested enough to watch -- but no meetings had been scheduled by early 
April. Additionally, Garamendi would need to do some crash fund raising to buy 
TV time. As a last resort, he could dip into the Garamendi coffers. The family, 
worth several million from real estate deals and other ventures, has given or 
loaned more than $1 million to their own campaigns in the past.  
</P>
<P>
 On issues, Garamendi and Brown are similar in many respects: Each calls for 
reform of education, making schools safe, being tough on crime, and providing 
tax incentives to revitalize California industry. They're further apart on 
immigration, with Brown calling for using troops to monitor the Mexican border 
and Garamendi, speaking in more conciliatory tones, emphasizing his immigrant 
roots and rejecting calls for denying citizenship to U.S.-born babies of 
non-citizen parents. Garamendi has so far not fully exploited one major 
difference: his enthusiastic backing of the death penalty, which Brown opposes 
while insisting that she will enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Brown, he exudes passion about a vision for California, saying that the 
state has the rare opportunity to meld diverse cultures and their talents into 
a new renaissance comparable to Europe's of the last millennium. And he 
contrasts his experience with her relative lack of it. ("Most every tax 
incentive stimulation package and program discussed by my opponents," he says 
in one speech, "came from work my staff and I did years ago in the state 
Senate.") 
</P>
<P>
 But the broader theme Garamendi promotes is one of determined leadership that 
refuses to give up until there is agreement. He cites the three years he spent 
in the 1970s bringing Nevada into a new interstate compact with California to 
control runaway development in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Nevada was particularly 
reluctant because the compact effectively would prevent the construction of 
more high-rise casinos on the Nevada shore. But until a new compact was signed, 
there could be no other development on either side of the lake. "We created a 
situation where it was in their interest to do something," Garamendi says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also takes credit for bringing parties together in support of Proposition 
111 in 1990, the gasoline tax increase that revived a stagnant highway and 
transportation system in California. Again, it took months of meetings, "and I 
simply wouldn't let them go until it was done." 
</P>
<P>
 In typical fashion, he tends to gloss over the work of others. But Garamendi 
supporter David Mixner, a pioneering political leader of the gay community, 
sees a benefit in the fact that Garamendi is not a team player. Such a stance, 
he says, can lead to political effectiveness because independence is sometimes 
"another definition of putting other people's feet to the fire to get things 
done. . . . He passionately cares. He will short-circuit others to get things 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 And he is an acknowledged policy wonk. Says Diane Watson, who succeeded 
Garamendi as chairman of the Senate's Health and Human Services Committee: 
"John always had a plan. He was the one who always had the charts and graphs 
and how we could improve the policy."  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Brown, Garamendi's image is not particularly polarized by partisanship. 
The Times California survey in late March found that among Democrats, 51% like 
him and 15% do not. The numbers are similar among independents at 55% to 13%. 
And even among Republicans, he finds more positive ratings -- 43% -- than 
negative -- 13%. But, the poll found, many of the Democrats who like him seem 
to like Brown more. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Beverly has known Garamendi throughout most of his legislative career and 
is one colleague who genuinely likes him. But whether he would be a good 
governor? "That's hard to say. Watching him in action over the last, what is 
it, 20 years, he might have his eye on the presidency as he walks in the door, 
the day he walks into the corner (governor's) office." 
</P>
<P>
 The ambition thing again. The issue comes up repeatedly with Garamendi, says 
Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sylmar, because "John is fairly up front 
about his ambition, more than other people, and they tend to hold that against 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an anomaly," Beverly adds after a long pause. "On paper, he's such a 
superb candidate, like you called Central Casting and asked for one. You couple 
that with his charming wife and a beautiful family. Yet with all that, he's not 
popular; an attitude, an arrogance comes across, something. That's puzzling." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than try to explain himself, Garamendi returns to his strength, says 
Johnston, "which is working with his hands. John is, if there's a physical 
aspect to a task, much more comfortable." In the physics of Garamendi's 
universe, motion seems to be a constant, regenerating force. After dinner, 
he'll sit a few minutes, then jump up and continue to talk while washing 
dishes. What does he do to relax? "Work," he says. "Go out and prune trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Garamendi campaigns the way he prunes trees or digs postholes -- with 
so much urgency that it seems he's trying to physically move the entire state 
of California with those big hands. But can he transmit that intensity to 
enough Democrats and capture their votes by June 7? Garamendi's tactic is 
working better than political experts thought possible six months ago, but time 
is growing short. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Garamendi's off to more back-road towns that many Californians never heard 
of to toil at ordinary jobs for a few hours beside ordinary people. Working man 
to the core, he thrives on it.

THE JURY IS BACK; A MURDER CASE INVOLVING TWO GYPSIES TESTS THE WATERS OF CIVIL 
LIBERTIES IN RUSSIA, WHERE JURIES HAVE BEEN BANNED FOR 75 YEARS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A train pulls out of Moscow's Paveletsky Station in a swirl of snow and steam. 
It is a wintry afternoon, Election Day for Russia's new Parliament. Settling 
into his overnight compartment, Sergei Pashin, a lawyer on President Boris N. 
Yeltsin's legal team, stows his fur hat, puts on his slippers and makes room 
for his traveling companions -- boxes full of courtroom computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pashin has already voted, for the "Russia's Choice" slate that supports 
radical reform. Now he's headed for Saratov, a city on the Volga River about 
450 miles and 18 hours away. A team traveling with Pashin from the American Bar 
Assn.'s Moscow office debates the best way to guard the boxes, which spill over 
into the group's sleeping quarters. Pashin picks up his book, a Russian edition 
of "The Name of the Rose." Later he will turn to his other reading material: 
Criminal Case No. 6391. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholarly, soft-spoken and barely into his 30s, Pashin heads the reform unit 
of Russia's State Legal Agency, which works at the president's behest. His job, 
he says, is "to sell new ideas to the public." The one taking him on this trip 
is borrowed from Russia's pre-Revolutionary days: trial by jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Pashin is Russia's chief crusader for jury trial, and his message is simple: 
True democracy isn't possible without criminal justice. And after decades of 
abuse, criminal justice isn't possible without juries. Pashin also likes to say 
that jury duty is a way to help raise the low level of legal awareness, "a way 
to help turn people into citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tough sell in today's Russia, where crime is sharply up and liberal 
reform is generally beating a retreat. Newspapers are packed with stories about 
Mafia schemes, murdered bankers and street brawls that turn into shootouts -- 
not exactly the perfect time for citizens to be learning about the link between 
democracy and civil liberties for defendants. But thanks to Pashin's quiet 
persistence, the jury project is still on track. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the train pulls into Saratov the next day, the election tallies 
are showing a trend. Russia's new State Duma will be dominated by 
conservatives, Communists and the ultranationalists led by Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky, a lawyer who has suggested on-the-spot death sentences for 
suspected organized-crime kingpins. 
</P>
<P>
 For Pashin, the Dec. 12 election news isn't good, but the timing is 
significant. The criminal matter in his briefcase will come to Saratov's court 
in a few days. "So, while the election is deciding who will take what seat at 
the top," he says, "down below, a real event is happening -- a demonstration of 
adherence to a democratic ideal." Russia's first jury trial in more than 75 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge: "State your full name." Defendant: "Artur Martynov." Judge: "Date of 
birth?" Defendant: "25 of April, 1972." Judge: "Nationality?" Defendant: 
"Gypsy." Judge: "Criminal record?" Defendant: "None." 
</P>
<P>
 In a third-floor courtroom of the Saratov Regional Court, Artur Martynov and 
his brother Alexander rise to hear Chief Judge Alexander Galkin read the 
charges against them. Around midnight on Jan. 25, 1993, the indictment says, 
the brothers wantonly murdered three acquaintances after a night of heavy 
drinking and card-playing. The motive: robbery. The weapon: an ax handle. If 
convicted, the two face up to 15 years in prison or even the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence erupted in Artur's rented shack in the dreary factory town of 
Engels, across the river from Saratov. The 21-year-old Artur is pleading 
innocent. Alexander, 23, admits using the ax handle, but only in self-defense. 
Both deny robbing the victims, who, they say, threatened them with deadly 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Pale and slight, with dark, close-cropped hair, the two have spent the past 
year behind bars. Normally, they'd be placed in a metal cage during the trial, 
but in deference to the jury, the cage has been removed. By Russian standards, 
in fact, the renovated courtroom is elegant: freshly paneled and painted, with 
a new jury box and rows of public seating. The Russian tricolor hangs on the 
wall behind Galkin, who is wearing, for the first time, a judicial robe. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Martynovs were arrested, juries didn't exist in Russia. But by the 
time prosecutors were ready to go to trial, Pashin and company had pushed their 
jury bill through the old Russian Parliament. The law, which took effect last 
November, says that felony defendants in nine of Russia's 88 oblasts, or 
regions, from suburban Moscow to Siberia, can opt for jury trial over the usual 
judge tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed in jail of his new right, Artur Martynov immediately decided that 
with a jury, he had "a chance." His court-appointed lawyer, Svetlana Romanova, 
tried to talk him out of it. "I said, 'There's a certain risk; it'll be the 
first jury trial, and it's your case,' " she recalls. There was also the danger 
of drawing jurors who disliked Gypsies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Martynovs computed the odds differently. Barely literate (Artur signed 
his pretrial statements with an X), they easily grasped what their fate would 
be in a traditional court before a judge and two "people's assessors." 
Defendants call the lay assessors "nodders" because they almost always vote 
with the judge, who, more than 99% of the time, issues a guilty verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for the case, Romanova and Vera Afanasyeva, Alexander's lawyer, met 
with their clients a few times. But they didn't investigate the events 
surrounding the killings or interview anyone on the court's witness list. Those 
are the prosecutor's exclusive rights. "Russian defense attorneys don't know 
how to investigate a case; they've been prohibited from doing it," says Stephen 
Thaman, a former Oakland public defender who now runs the ABA program to aid 
jury trial in Russia. "In the past, some have even been arrested for tampering 
with witnesses for interviewing them." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury ensures an independent verdict, but it hasn't changed any of this. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will it alter the trial's non-adversarial nature, which allows the court 
wide latitude with witnesses. "You have the right. . . ," Galkin begins, 
addressing the defendants in a speech he knows by heart after 20 years on the 
bench. He tells the Martynovs that they can personally question witnesses and 
object to motions. So can the victims' survivors, who sit near the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge then turns to the potential jurors who fill the courtroom's first 
four rows. The 30 people have been randomly chosen from local voting lists. 
(The U.S.-provided computer gear lugged from Moscow is meant to expedite that.) 
</P>
<P>
 Galkin thanks them for coming, adding that they will be paid (about $2.50 a 
day). "Today is a historic event in the life of Russia, the rebirth of jury 
trial," he says. "I understand your anxiety. I'm anxious myself." Actually, 
Galkin is poised and assured. He has been studying up on jury trials since 
returning from a Harvard University jury seminar a year earlier, though he 
likes to tell reporters that his know-how comes from watching courtroom scenes 
on "Santa Barbara" reruns. 
</P>
<P>
 Voir dire of the jurors is next, though it doesn't reveal much about the 
panel. Even the prosecutor's telling question -- "Are any of you not happy with 
the work of the prosecutor's office or the court because you think your rights 
have been violated?" -- fails to elicit a raised hand. Ninety minutes into the 
trial, Elizabeta Dunayevskaya, a 45-year-old piano teacher, becomes Russia's 
first modern juror. When the jury box is full, Galkin administers the oath. One 
by one, the nine women and three men stand and say, "I swear." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Juries first appeared in Russia in 1864, as part of the Great Legal Reforms of 
Czar Alexander II, who liberated the serfs three years earlier. Then, as now, 
juries were phased in gradually. Then, as now, potential jurors had to be 25 to 
70 years old and free of criminal charges. In fact, the new jury law closely 
resembles its 19th-Century predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury trial flourished during the next 50 years, "and between 1864 and 1917, we 
had a whole constellation of brilliant defense lawyers," says Alexei Galoganov, 
a prominent Moscow lawyer. In two famous trials, one near the beginning of this 
great experiment and one at the end, juries handed down acquittals that flew in 
the face of the czar's authority. In 1878, a jury cleared Vera Zasulich, a 
young radical who admitted taking a shot at St. Petersburg's governor. And in 
1913, a Kiev jury made up mostly of uneducated peasants acquitted a Jewish 
merchant, Mendel Beilis, of ritually murdering a Christian child -- a charge 
trumped up by the anti-Semitic Black Hundreds group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bolsheviks banned jury trial as "bourgeois" shortly after taking power 
in 1917. Instead, they set up the courts that essentially survive today. Once 
controlled by the Communist Party, most judges today remain rubber stamps for 
prosecutors. "Why would a defense lawyer spend his talent and ardor on the 
judge and those assessors?" asks Galoganov. "He knows no one is listening. The 
judge doesn't listen, because he's busy putting down the verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 The move to bring back the jury began in 1991, when Russia was still part of 
the Soviet Union. "The Concept of Judicial Reform" was a clarion call issued by 
the old Russian Parliament's Legal Reform subcommittee, a hotbed of liberal 
thinking in the Mikhail Gorbachev years. 
</P>
<P>
 Astonishingly frank, the subcommittee's document described Russia's courts as 
"inherited from a totalitarian regime," "merciless" and as a place where 
prosecutors won unearned convictions with "mediocre or even bad" 
investigations. It recommended the return of jury trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Pashin was a committee consultant at the time and wrote part of the document. 
For that, at the age of 29, he was awarded the title of Honored Lawyer of the 
Russian Federation -- the youngest ever to receive it. That same year, he 
drafted the law that created Russia's Constitutional Court. (For that he got a 
bonus of two months' pay. A new father at the time, he bought a washing 
machine.) 
</P>
<P>
 He joined Yeltsin's State Legal Agency when it was established in 1992 to 
study legal issues. Among the reforms he pushed through was a long-overdue law 
on habeas corpus, which allows arrestees to appeal their detentions through the 
courts. Then he worked on the jury bill. "Pashin's very bright, very 
quick-witted," says Valery Rudnev, a leading legal writer for the daily 
Izvestia, who calls the agency "a mighty mobile machine for reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Pashin studied jury trial at Moscow State University Law School, where he took 
courses called "Bourgeois Public Law" and "The Reactionary Substance of the 
Bourgeois Criminal Process." The classes often taught the concepts -- 
presumption of innocence and trial by jury -- that they were meant to 
criticize. "There were layers of text, and we were skilled at taking them 
apart," Pashin says, adding that for students, "some things were just 
ritualistic, like uttering a prayer. We'd say, 'The capitalists deluded their 
people with the help of their reactionary criminal process.' And then we could 
go on with the discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Russian reformers besides Pashin have worked to bring back the jury, but 
by now, jury trial is linked to Pashin's name. "He's the real gray matter 
behind the project," says the ABA's Thaman. 
</P>
<P>
 Political savvy was another matter. Pashin twice failed to pass the jury bill 
through the old Parliament last year, largely because of fierce opposition from 
Russia's then-Chief Prosecutor, Valentin Stepankov. From the dais, Stepankov 
pronounced the idea "foreign" and the work of "armchair legal scientists." One 
of Pashin's colleagues in Parliament, Mikhail Paleev, helped to horse-trade 
with Stepankov's office to reach a compromise bill. Though it kept the crucial 
new preliminary hearing to exclude any illegal evidence at the trial, it 
retained many familiar features of the old court system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to work," predicts Izvestia's Rudnev. "Personally, I am in 
love with the idea of jury trial. But we are trying to squeeze the jury into 
the framework of the former Soviet court procedure." Pashin prefers to think of 
it as merely a first step. "The new law," he says, "belongs to the transitional 
period." 
</P>
<P>
 After the law passed in Parliament last July, Pashin stepped up his own 
training sessions at the Russian Legal Academy, a brushup college run by the 
Justice Ministry. His classes stretched into the fall and continued through 
October's bloody White House uprising and the crackdown that followed. At mock 
trial after mock trial, he coached hundreds of judges and lawyers through the 
new jury trial procedure. Not surprisingly, their skills were pretty appalling. 
(A devoted viewer of "L.A. Law" probably could have mustered more poise.) "It's 
very new; I feel like an idiot," a longtime defense lawyer complained, 
grappling with the notions of excluded evidence, juror selection and the simple 
act of leaving his chair to question a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, officials began scrambling as the jury law went into effect in 
the first five regions involved -- suburban Moscow, Ivanov, Ryazan, Saratov and 
Stavropol (Moscow and St. Petersburg are excluded for now, because their chief 
judges haven't as yet supported jury trial). The Justice Ministry had to 
intervene in Ryazan when reports filtered back that the juries were being 
handpicked by the court. Saratov, however, was ready. By mid-November, its 
court put the first jury trial on the calendar for Dec. 15 and assigned the 
case to its chief judge, Alexander Galkin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the jury in the box, Judge Galkin delivers an eloquent discourse on 
presumption of innocence, the nature of evidence and jurors' responsibilities. 
He has adapted much of this from a jury trial Bench Book being prepared by the 
ABA and a team of Russian scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finishes, prosecutor Vyacheslav Simshin, wearing the quasi-military 
blue uniform of his profession, rises to elaborate on the indictment. Simshin 
has been practicing his speeches for weeks and rereading his Dale Carnegie 
self-help books. Standing squarely in front of the jurors, he maintains that on 
the night of Jan. 25, 1993, the Martynovs planned to rob and murder their three 
drinking buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Martynovs struck them with the ax handle, he says, and "with exceptional 
cruelty" finished the job by stomping on the fallen men. The two then grabbed a 
denim jacket, a mink hat, a gold chain and other items altogether worth about 
40,000 rubles, roughly $60 at the time. Finally, Simshin says, Alexander tried 
to set the victims aflame. 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin must prove exceptional cruelty -- stomping and burning -- as well as 
the intended robbery, to get a conviction on the aggravated murder charges. 
Seated near the jury, the victims' survivors sob. The jurors remain impassive. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants testify that the three men attacked them for their 
privatization investment vouchers and some jewelry. "One of them said, 'I'm 
such a dangerous person in Engels, I'll burn your house,' " Artur testifies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Artur was so drunk he was passing out on the couch, the brothers 
testify. Alexander thought the men were trying to strangle Artur, and he struck 
out with the ax handle. The men fell, but were still alive. Alexander dragged 
Artur out of the house, and the brothers fled. 
</P>
<P>
 There are problems for the Martynovs with this version. For one thing, at the 
preliminary hearing, evidence that could have helped them was ruled 
inadmissible. Another friend was with them that night -- a man, they say, who 
might have gone back into the house to kill and burn the victims. But this 
witness was deemed too "mentally ill" to testify. (After the trial, defense 
attorney Romanova reflects that perhaps she should have opposed the exclusion.) 
</P>
<P>
 For another, the Martynovs told a different story when they were arrested. 
Artur initially confessed to attacking the victims, but now he says he was only 
trying to take on his brother's responsibility. Alexander confessed to setting 
the fires -- because police beat him, he maintains. The jury must decide which 
version to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 As prosecutor, Simshin gets first crack at the defendants. "How did you make 
money?" he begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: How do people live now? I was unloading things in the railway station. 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin: Why do you have no permanent place of employment? 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: Nobody was hiring me. Where should I go? 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin: What was your brother Alexander doing in Engels? 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: He just came to visit me. 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin: Were there times when you drank together? 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: When I had the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin: When did your wife leave? What was the reason? 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: I drank at her sister's birthday party and she quarreled with me. Not a 
quarrel, she just decided to leave me. 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin: Were there occasions when you used violence toward her? 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: (Silence). 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin: Did you beat your wife? 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: Well, sometimes. Maybe slap her a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin's initial salvo is aimed at establishing the defendant's poor 
character. Then he asks the brothers -- and a string of witnesses -- to 
describe the boots, jeans and jackets they were wearing as they fled Engels. He 
hopes this will corroborate the circumstantial case assembled by investigators: 
that robbery was the motive for the alleged crime. But the testimony doesn't 
support this allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to his earlier strategy, he calls an Engels resident as a witness 
and asks: "Are these the people who live next door to you?" After some 
shrugging and peering at the Martynovs (Gypsies "all look alike," the neighbor 
complains), the man says yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "And how did they behave?" Simshin asks. The witness answers this one 
immediately. "They behaved," he says, "like Gypsies." Judge Galkin adjourns for 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 JUDGE: ARTUR MARTYNOV, please explain where you gave truthful testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: Here in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge: Why did you give other testimony at the time of the preliminary 
investigation? 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: I wanted to help my brother. But first they beat me, made me sign my 
first testimony -- I didn't sign, I just put a cross there. 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin: You had pressure from the police or investigators? 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: When I started telling the truth, they didn't believe me. They started 
beating me, saying, "Tell us the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin: You told someone? A doctor or nurse? 
</P>
<P>
 Artur: There isn't any treatment there. They treat you like a dog. Go there at 
night sometime, you'll hear people crying. Please explain, where could I 
complain? 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to point out that the Martynovs could be lying in court, Simshin only 
elicits this potentially damaging testimony (which jurors later say they 
believed. Coerced confessions, after all, are part of Communism's legacy). 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin: Why did you give testimony at the preliminary investigation that you 
burned the house? 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander: Because I was scared. The police brought me to a little yard, they 
blindfolded me and asked me to run. I refused. They started beating me, made me 
kneel, told me to crawl and they were firing shots. I gave this wrong testimony 
so they would stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin calls more witnesses to testify about what the Martynovs were wearing 
after that night of violence. But they say the two were dressed as poorly as 
usual and that they had no extra money or jewels. The police who arrested the 
Martynovs can't recall anything about their jeans or boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Simshin's forensic evidence is no clearer. Tests conducted on traces of blood 
found on the defendants' clothing are not inconsistent with his theory that 
blood burst from the victims as they were stomped on. But defense attorneys, 
gaining confidence as the trial progresses, point out that the tests are not 
conclusive, either. Simshin then reads aloud a pretrial report on the 
Martynovs' poor "character" -- their drinking and divorces. Romanova and 
Afanasyeva counter with a reading of the victims' past convictions for violent 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, out of ammunition, Simshin makes a dramatic motion. In light of the 
shoddy investigation, he moves to lower the charges. "The materials were not 
compiled in the right way," he says. He will drop the robbery and "wanton" 
murder charges altogether. (The victims' relatives, who might have objected at 
this point, were not in court. They stopped coming after the first day.) 
</P>
<P>
 The new indictment accuses Artur of killing just one man, and Alexander of the 
murder of the other two, "while exceeding the limits of necessary 
self-defense." The possible punishment: work-camp sentences of up to 10 years. 
Closing arguments the next day, Judge Galkin says, will be based on the 
softened indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the corridor, Pashin looks extremely pleased. Is he certain that 
Simshin's hand was forced by the presence of the jury? "I'm completely sure," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Distinguished jurors, an investigator restores a picture piece by piece," 
Simshin says. "It's like when a little boy takes sugar from the jar without his 
mother's permission. The next day, he learns that his mother knew. How? Because 
his mother was washing the floor carefully, and found the tiny grains. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The jury hears closing arguments for about an hour. By now, both sides are 
wielding the time-honored courtroom weapons: folksy wisdom, patriotism, 
platitudes about the simple life of poor people. Simshin's sugar story comes 
not from his Dale Carnegie book, but from a textbook for foreign lawyers 
written by William Burnham, a specialist in Russian court reform at Wayne State 
University Law School in Michigan. (An excerpt in Russian has been floating 
around legal circles.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's well-known, that sugar bowl story," laughs Burnham, an ABA observer in 
Saratov. "I first heard it 15 years ago in Chicago. It's used where there's a 
great deal of circumstantial evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for their last words, the defendants, too, make their appeals. Artur 
Martynov: guilty. "Citizens, please believe me. I was drunk. I didn't do 
anything," Artur says. Alexander adds: "I didn't kill. I just hit and we left." 
</P>
<P>
 Galkin reminds the jurors that their ultimate decision need not be unanimous, 
although they must try for unanimity during their first three hours of 
deliberation. After that, a majority rules. A 6-6 vote results in acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later they are back, with a unanimous decision. Artur Martynov: 
guilty. But it is "probable" that his actions were committed in self-defense. 
Alexander Martynov: guilty, but in defense of his brother. The jury recommends 
leniency for him. The case has essentially been reduced to manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Galkin reads the sentence: For Artur, a year and a half in a work camp. For 
Alexander, a year. Both are to include time served. The Martynovs smile for the 
first time, and embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good, just verdict, based on evidence and the honest work of the 
jury process," Pashin says afterward, in his usual measured phrases. Then with 
uncharacteristic euphoria, he breaks into a grin. "It's a real holiday," he 
says. "And tomorrow is my birthday." He'll be 31. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a long time to change a system, it doesn't happen overnight," 
Burnham says on the phone a few weeks after the trial. "But the way to judge if 
the Russian jury system is working is if it re-instills confidence in the 
judicial system." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen jury trials later, it's still too early to know. Already, 
there has been one outright acquittal, and slowly, defendants in the targeted 
regions are opting for jury trials. But decades of judicial abuse have 
embittered Russia's citizens and left them without a notion of their rights or 
their power as jurors. After the Martynov trial, one juror, Dunayevskaya, the 
piano teacher, said that she had been put off by the defense attorneys' desire 
to acquit their clients, "because one can't start declaring the murderer to be 
fully innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Another juror, unhappy with the light sentence, is more cynical. "Everything 
was decided beforehand by the judge," he says, adding, "It's not time to start 
jury trial in Russia. What's necessary at the moment is a tough, cruel law. We 
have to get rid of criminals, to have a civilized country." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Constitution approved by Russian voters in December calls for juries, 
and to Pashin this means that jury trial "will be hard to undo" despite the 
outcry against crime. It may take 10 to 15 years, he says, but eventually 
juries will be phased in all over Russia, as they were in the 19th Century. But 
the Saratov jurors' sentiments show just how far Russia is from creating the 
enlightened citizens that Pashin hopes for, and legal reformers know it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, the economic calamities have told on the population," says Alexei 
Galoganov, the defense lawyer. "They have many bitter feelings. Envy. Greed. A 
feeling about the unfairness of fate. And you need to fight all those feelings 
to make jury trial work. To make a person forget all his personal hardships and 
put all his attention to deciding fairly on the fate of the person in the 
dock."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: WATCH THAT PLACEMENT!; 
TRYING HARD TO BE 'MAJOR LEAGUE'

 Product placements are nothing new in movies -- but every once in a while, a 
film comes along that's so, well, enthusiastic in its use of brand-name 
products that you wonder if the filmmakers crafted a story that would fit 
around these subliminal commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, sports movies seem most prone to this brand of commercialism. 
Last year, it was "Rookie of the Year"; this year, the new champ is "Major 
League II," a film that opened at the top of the box-office list its first week 
and now is at No. 5. The recognizable brands include almost a dozen visible on 
stadium billboards, plus several more we analyze below. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Product: Pepsi Cola. 
</P>
<P>
 Where it turns up: Everywhere -- on machines, being consumed, on billboards at 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it's shown: Often enough to be considered the official drink of 
"Major League II." 
</P>
<P>
 Does it sell the product?: Looks like the soft drink of losers -- oops, no, 
they're winners again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Product: Evian. 
</P>
<P>
 Where it turns up: Being consumed by announcer Bob Uecker when the Indians are 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it's shown: Prominently featured in several scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it sell the product?: Not if you have to dress like Uecker -- who looks 
like Regis Philbin channeling for Liberace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Product: Jack Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 Where it turns up: Uecker drinks himself into oblivion in the booth when the 
Indians take a dive in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it's shown: You have time to read all that printing on the label. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it sell the product?: Only to people who believe that drinking will solve 
their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Product: Right Guard Sports Stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Where it turns up: During the shooting of a commercial featuring Rick Vaughn 
(Charlie Sheen), in which he keeps blowing his lines. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it's shown: Product itself is shown at the end of the faux ad -- 
upside down (it's a joke). 
</P>
<P>
 Does it sell the product?: Yes -- because these folks obviously have a sense 
of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Product: Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 Where it turns up: Emblazoned on the side of cups in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it's shown: Each time the action moves indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it sell the product?: No -- because the Gatorade dispenser is sitting 
next to an espresso machine, which looks much more inviting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Product: "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Where it turns up: As part of his agent's marketing plan, Vaughn shows up to 
banter with Jay Leno in the middle of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it's shown: Long enough for Leno to reveal the strain of holding up 
his end of a dialogue scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it sell the product?: No -- it makes you want to flip to Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Product: Sheraton Inner Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Where it turns up: A sign on the left-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it's shown: Every time there's a fly ball to left. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it sell the product?: No -- but it confirms the suspicion that, though 
this film ostensibly takes place in Cleveland, it was actually filmed at 
Baltimore's Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Product: Sony products. 
</P>
<P>
 Where it turns up: As brand name on ultra-big-screen TV at the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 How long it's shown: Every time there's a shot of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it sell the product?: You bet -- you're tempted to watch it, rather than 
the movie.

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE AMERICAN WAY . . . 
THAT'S LITIGATION!; WANT TO SHOW A CLIP FROM A FRED ASTAIRE FILM? BETTER ASK 
ROBYN ASTAIRE FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the most moving segments of "That's Entertainment! III" involve the 
liquid dancing and mischievous percussion playing of the incomparable Fred 
Astaire, one of the huge stars in MGM's stable during its golden years and 
celebrated in the new film. 
</P>
<P>
 But moviegoers might easily have been denied the pleasure of seeing Astaire -- 
not because of lack of interest of MGM in providing the footage, but because, 
sources say, Astaire's widow, Robyn, threw up legal roadblocks that only 
recently were overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Robyn Astaire already has proven intractable over use of her late husband's 
image: 1992's Kennedy Center tribute to the career of Astaire's longtime 
partner, Ginger Rogers, ultimately had to be televised without a single clip of 
the couple dancing together, because she demanded $15,000 per minute of footage 
used, a price the Kennedy Center said it could not pay. The refusal caused a 
furor, but Robyn Astaire did not back down. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear sources at MGM and co-producer Turner Entertainment (which owns the 
rights to the old MGM and RKO libraries, which include some of Astaire's finest 
performances), who asked not to be identified, tell it, securing rights to 
footage of Astaire was a monumental task that took several months. Robyn 
Astaire demanded a high sum of money and other specific perks, including a seat 
as prominent as that of MGM/UA chairman Frank Mancuso's at the May 6 premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, MGM says that there were no real problems and points to the 
finished product, which includes several clips of Astaire, as proof. They 
blamed the film's long delay -- it was supposed to have been released last 
November -- solely on technological snafus and restoration details, 
particularly in restoring the soundtrack into stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 The project started when former MGM/UA chief Alan Ladd Jr. greenlit a request 
from George Feltenstein, head of MGM video, to put together a third look at the 
studio's musical heyday for about $1.5 million. The plan was to simply cull 
clips from the studio's video library. But in the midst of doing that, 
Feltenstein realized that he didn't have clearances from Robyn Astaire. 
Astaire, who died at 88 on June 22, 1987, was the only one of MGM's big 
contract stars of the '30s and '40s who later gained some control over 
negatives to some of his films. 
</P>
<P>
 Robyn Astaire did not return phone calls or faxed requests for an interview, 
but her representative, Thomas A. White, a Beverly Hills consultant on artists' 
rights enforcement, spoke on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put this in context," he said. "Seating arrangements at a premiere are the 
most innocuous kind of benefit to give someone. Studios sharing the proper 
protocol for people who have been involved in the project, whether they be the 
stars, directors, producers or those who helped bring the project to life . . . 
in this case one of the widows . . . should not be disregarded." White refused 
to discuss financial terms of the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 He finds suggestions that his client is being greedy or difficult to be 
without merit.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Astaire is simply following her late husband's wishes. There has been so 
much propaganda about her and her business decisions. Fred Astaire was a very 
shrewd, intelligent businessman. He wanted his performances to be portrayed 
before the public in full form, not in bites like film clips." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 White bristles over questions about the Kennedy Center ordeal. Sources 
involved in the Kennedy Center Honors event said that when the center refused 
to pay the sum demanded by Robyn Astaire -- as a rule, no one involved in a 
tribute is paid -- she insisted that Astaire segments already shown at the 
tribute taping in Washington be edited out; those numbers did not appear in the 
subsequent broadcast of the tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The TV production was a complex matter, but let me just say that Mrs. Astaire 
was being coerced and she refused to be bullied," White said. "Besides, the 
counterargument you always hear from anyone who wants to use the Astaire films 
is 'We're going to do this great public service to keep your husband's memory 
alive.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, guess what -- that's a myth and it's tired. It's a feeble come-on to 
continue making money off an artist's work and cheat the artist. Mrs. Astaire's 
actions should be an example."  
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy Center sources involved declined to comment publicly, saying it would 
be "beating a dead horsewoman" (Robyn Astaire is a former jockey).  
</P>
<P>
 But that is not expected to happen with "That's Entertainment! III." 
Feltenstein says he believes that Robyn Astaire is happy with the production 
and the terms of her agreement with the studio. And he sounds pleased that at 
last the film is scheduled for release. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one big plus out of this," he says. "The release has been timed 
perfectly with MGM's 70th anniversary, perfect counterprogramming for summer 
movie fare. Now, that's entertainment."*

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE BEDROCK BUZZ; WILL 
'FLINTSTONES' BOLSTER GOODMAN'S ROCKY FILM CAREER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Universal Pictures' take on "The Flintstones" -- the world's best known modern 
Stone Age family -- may be hitting bedrock, if people who have seen early 
screenings of the picture have anything to say about it. 
</P>
<P>
 They accuse the studio and producer Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment of 
skewing the dinosaur fable to an audience too young (10 and under) to relate to 
the characters, of building a movie on a script that seems to have been written 
by committee, and of riddling the whole thing with jokes that don't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you could sum this picture up in two words: young and stupid," says 
one Universal source who saw the film. "The studio is banking on adults loving 
it, but guess what? Adults aren't that stupid -- I think." 
</P>
<P>
 A Universal executive pinned the problem to the movie's being one long sight 
gag and having too many cooks in the kitchen. "This is no great script -- but 
then what do you expect when you've got 32 writers contributing to it? Hell, 
they had eight writers and the director reworking the final draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "And by the way, this is the new thing in Hollywood. Throw every writer you 
know at a script and if each one of them can come up with three or four jokes 
then you may get enough gags and it will hit. Let's face it. That's what works 
on TV and this is just live-action TV . . . minus the action." 
</P>
<P>
 Even John Goodman, who stars as Fred Flintstone, concedes that the plot is a 
little thin. "But we are talking about the Flintstones."  
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is dissing the film. "I've seen this picture and the 
criticisms simply are not true. It may be skewed toward younger audiences, but 
believe me, people at least 35 and up who grew up on 'The Flintstones' are 
going to want to see it," says entertainment attorney David Colden, who 
represents director Brian Levant. "It is visually wonderful, with such 
marvelous set-pieces, dinosaur animatronics, a great use of color and costume, 
that as an adult you just go along for the ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Universal studio head Tom Pollock couldn't agree more. "Look, I'm sure there 
are people who don't think it works. It does. This is for family audiences, but 
the strength of the movie is not so much that it has a PG rating; it has visual 
effects that you've never seen before." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters are quick to note that McDonald's certainly believes enough in the 
May 27 release to launch Flintstones Happy Meals and collector glasses. In 
fact, critics and fans alike expect that Universal will see a merchandising 
windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman is also probably hoping for a feature-film breakthrough, since despite 
his star turn on the top-rated series "Roseanne," his film career has never 
quite taken off. His recent roles in flips like "Born Yesterday," "Matinee" and 
"The Babe" haven't helped matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goodman is a great guy and a talented character actor, but let's face it: Add 
up the budgets of those pictures where he's the star and you're looking at 
about $200 million flushed down the drain. Let's hope this breaks the Goodman 
curse," says one source close to the production. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman doesn't blame anybody or anything. "I'm sorry people feel that way," 
says Goodman, with a nervous laugh. "You know, when I do a role I go into (it) 
and once my job is done I try not to think about it. I'm disappointed like 
everyone else that 'Babe' went into the toilet because everybody thought it 
would do well." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he was "a little apprehensive about taking the role. It was kind of 
ordained on me by Spielberg" when Spielberg approached him about playing Fred 
five years ago. "I never knew it was going to happen, because it was off and on 
so many times until they came up with a script they liked. I think it works; I 
hope so." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the apprehension about the part, Goodman retorts: "Because it's just 
what I thought would happen -- I hear 'Yabba-dabba-doo' every time I walk down 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 That is music to Pollock's ears: "John Goodman is a great Fred Flintstone and 
a talented actor. There is no Goodman curse -- but even if there was, John 
doesn't carry this one, Fred Flintstone does."*

RUBEN BLADES' PANAMANIAN PIPE DREAM; THE SINGER-ACTOR FINDS THE SPOTLIGHT IS 
HOTTER WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Tracy Wilkinson is The Times' San Salvador Bureau chief. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruben Blades -- salsa star, Hollywood actor and Panamanian presidential 
candidate -- is walking along the cracked red-brick streets of San Felipe, the 
ramshackle barrio in Panama City's old quarter where he grew up. "Hey, Ruben!" 
residents call out from their stoops and cluttered balconies. "Va pa'lante?" 
they ask, an inquiry about the state of Blades' campaign. Is it going well? 
"We're behind, but don't give up," he tells them. 
</P>
<P>
 Blades pauses to take a seat on a green wooden bench under the cypress trees 
of Plaza Herrera, in the heart of San Felipe. Old women stop to chat, 
remembering Blades as a child, discussing the neighbors who have come and gone, 
lamenting the decline of the community. "He always loved music as a boy," says 
81-year-old Juana Avila, wearing a brown floral dress and melon-colored tennis 
shoes. "I always said he was going to be a singer." 
</P>
<P>
 Blades, an icon in the music world who combines brains, street smarts and sex 
appeal to chronicle the human condition, is widely credited with taking salsa 
into the American mainstream. He crossed into movies in 1985's "Crossover 
Dreams" and has appeared with some of Hollywood's biggest names. His political 
dreams have long been known to those close to him, and now, despite formidable 
odds, he is acting on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Blades has come home to Panama, a home he has not lived in for nearly 20 
years. He has put his artistic career on pause in the pursuit of what skeptics 
would call a pipe dream. He is not just any refugee returning to a onetime war 
zone in the tropics: Blades wants to be president. 
</P>
<P>
 He has moved into a renovated, early 20th-Century apartment overlooking the 
Bay of Panama in a part of town that is slowly gentrifying -- returning, he 
says, to the closest thing to his roots. He still clicks with the people in the 
old neighborhood, for whom Blades' pop status has made him a sort of hero. But 
can Blades parlay a fame and fortune earned primarily in the United States into 
a victory in the most important election in Panamanian history? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere, you see one thing in common with all the people you talk to," he 
says after our stroll. "Their need to talk about problems and the need for 
change. I am not here to tell anyone how they should be, but I do have an 
obligation to myself to be of consequence. I know the streets well, and it 
worries me a lot what I see because I do not see hope in certain faces. It 
doesn't depress me. It inspires me." 
</P>
<P>
 As he reconnects to his past, Blades is hoping to change, radically, Panama's 
future. His candidacy is riding largely on his promises to break the country's 
seemingly endless cycle of dictators and toadies. Most of his opponents 
represent, one way or another, the past. One leading candidate is a product of 
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's political machine; another is a throwback to the 
pro-American oligarchs who periodically run the country. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was first rumored last year that Blades would enter the presidential 
race, he rocketed to a huge lead in public opinion surveys. No other candidate 
even seemed to register. But as the May 8 elections approach, Blades has fallen 
dramatically in the polls, sinking as low as third place though he recently 
rebounded to second. The local press either ignores or attacks him and he's had 
a hard time convincing many Panamanians that he is serious. He has been accused 
of being arrogant and aloof and many of his supporters are abandoning him. 
</P>
<P>
 Blades knows he is getting criticized, yet he is determined to run the 
campaign as he sees fit. He says he will do politics in a new and different 
way, even if it means losing the election. 
</P>
<P>
 PANAMA IS SUCH AN ECCENTRIC AND OUTLANDISH PLACE THAT A SALSERO president is 
not totally out of the question. This is the country where -- almost 4 1/2 
short years ago -- U.S. troops invaded to overthrow a military dictator who had 
been on the CIA payroll for years. Revolution then was being waged by people in 
BMWs, the ringleaders of subversion were Chamber of Commerce businessmen and 
one of the most galvanizing atrocities committed by the dictator's goons was 
burning a Jaguar dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a country where governments can be involved in scandals from drug 
trafficking to gun-running, and no one seems to bat an eye. Where the 
54-year-old president marries a student, barely half his age and a fraction of 
his weight, who then runs for mayor with an opposition party. It is a haven for 
money launderers, fugitives and deposed Central American leaders, who, as in 
the case of ousted Guatemalan autocrat Jorge Serrano, live in opulent homes and 
do lunch at the elite Union Club. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a country where part of national territory -- the Canal Zone -- was 
actually foreign territory, a U.S.-controlled swath that Panamanian citizens 
could not enter without permission. U.S. dollars serve as the national 
currency, even though Panamanians pretend they have their own bills, called 
balboas. 
</P>
<P>
 And right now, this is a country that is seething.  
</P>
<P>
 Noriega's fall signaled the end of two decades of military dictatorship and 
raised hopes of democracy. But President Guillermo Endara -- who won the 1989 
elections that Noriega annulled and was later put in office during a ceremony 
at a U.S. military base -- never seemed to get the hang of it. For many, his 
attempt at democracy bore too many of the same traits as the dictatorships -- 
corruption, nepotism and injustice. And his free-market policies seemed to 
deepen poverty for those on the bottom, while the rich just got richer. One in 
every five Panamanians is unemployed and about one in four lives in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 The groundswell of discontent seemed to invite an outsider candidacy in the 
presidential elections, which will be the first in decades to be free of 
military oversight and will largely determine whether democracy is going to 
take root in this country of 2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system failed," says Blades in a two-hour interview conducted principally 
in Spanish. "After the invasion, everyone was promised that things were going 
to be different, that (the government) was going to be serious, it was going to 
be efficient, there was not going to be corruption, that things would get 
fixed. Much was promised. Very little was accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Blades is seated now on the white-on-white sofa in the living room of his 
second-floor apartment. A breeze coaxed from the fans whirling on cathedral 
ceilings rustles through the potted palms. The apartment, built with the 
colonial-era foundations and walls that are typical in Panama's Casco Viejo, or 
old quarter, is decorated in a mix of antiques and modern bleached wood. Golden 
and fuchsia bougainvillea drape from the wrought-iron balcony. The 45-year-old 
entertainer no longer sports the mustache he wore in "The Milagro Beanfield 
War" and his hair is thinning. On this Saturday morning, he is dressed in 
spotless white sneakers, jeans and a teal polo shirt that sets off his hazel 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the period when we most need a response that is different from the 
traditional," Blades says. "And it is precisely the most difficult moment to 
present a response that is different because the people no longer believe in 
political answers. The people feel very betrayed -- disappointed, yes, but more 
than that, betrayed. (Our movement) is an anti-party. More than a simple change 
of party, we are trying to present a change in attitude, in political 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 POLITICS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN UNDERCURRENT IN BLADES' LIFE AND work. His family 
abandoned Panama in 1973 after Noriega accused Blades' father, a secret 
policeman at the time, of working for the CIA. (His father said the charge was 
false, and, of course, it was Noriega who worked for the CIA.) Ruben Sr., with 
his Cuban-American wife (also a singer and composer) and Ruben's four siblings 
moved to Miami, and Ruben followed the next year. He later moved to the 
Northeast, where his music career blossomed and he earned a degree in 
international law at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 Blades achieved megafame in New York -- first with bandleader Willie Colon and 
then with his own group, Seis del Solar -- as an innovative artist and two-time 
Grammy winner who elevated salsa from mere dance music to the realm of social 
protest. His music is quintessential salsa -- congas, maracas and horns -- but 
under the driving rhythm are lyrics like these from "Motherland" on Blades' 
1988 "Antecedente" album, which he dedicated to Panama: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some time ago a child asked me to explain the word motherland, what did it 
mean? . . . It's in the walls of our barrio, and in its brown hope; it's what 
those who leave take in their souls; it's in our martyrs' voices when they 
defended our flag . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, he moved to California to build his film career. He appeared in "The 
Two Jakes" with Jack Nicholson, a dozen or so other Hollywood productions and 
is in the upcoming "Color of Night" with Bruce Willis. 
</P>
<P>
 Blades, whose surname comes from his father's West Indies ancestors and is 
pronounced like razor blades, says he is not concerned about suspending his 
artistic career, although he winces at having to turn down a film offer to 
portray slain Brazilian environmentalist Chico Mendes. Agent Nick Stevens of 
United Talent Agency says he is confident his client can resume a film career 
at any time. "He's timeless," Stevens says from Los Angeles. "His career is not 
one of momentum. He's always gone off to do other things. I've always known 
that Ruben was interested in helping his homeland and his people above and 
beyond anything he was doing in the entertainment business. I always thought 
(the candidacy) was inevitable on some level." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate says he always planned to enter public service. As a student at 
Panama's National University some 25 years ago, Blades and his friends talked 
politics and plotted their grand schemes for changing their country, the singer 
recalls. Many of those friends have joined him in the presidential campaign. 
For Blades and the others, the 1964 anti-American demonstrations in which U.S. 
troops killed 21 Panamanian students had a lasting impact; Blades' platform 
calls for a gradual withdrawal of American troops by the year 2000 -- as 
scheduled in the 1977 canal treaties -- despite substantial public sentiment in 
favor of retaining U.S. military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 The first formal step in his political odyssey was to create a party in late 
1991. Named Papa Egoro, which means Mother Earth in the indigenous Embera 
language of Panama's Choco Indians, the party brought together a diverse group 
of people. Its ideology could not be easily labeled: Infused with an ecological 
motif, the party's platform advocates liberal social programs and better 
distribution of wealth, but also encourages business and private investment.  
</P>
<P>
 After its flashy start, however, his presidential bid is troubled. Blades has 
been criticized for an air of aloofness, not contributing his own money to the 
underfinanced effort and for conducting a campaign that has been, at times, 
strangely quiet. The low profile, he says, is part of a carefully considered 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our silence is the silence of he who is studying and writing, he who is 
preparing to offer a proposal," Blades says. "What has always gone on here is 
superficial politicking. People who have never entered a certain neighborhood 
are suddenly there, with a knot of people, with flags and giving away things. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the most important thing is to have the plan ready. You win, and what 
do you do afterward? Improvise? Not me. I do not want to win that way. The 
situation is too urgent and when the time comes that people want you to solve 
their problems, charisma won't work." 
</P>
<P>
 As the election approaches, Blades has started traveling the country and 
making more public appearances. He performed well in Panama's first-ever 
televised presidential debate last month. He still fluctuates between second 
and third place, however, having trailed the front-runner by as many as 25 
points. The question remains whether he can make up the lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDES IN THE CAMPAIGN CLOSE TO BLADES SPEAK OF HIS "UNIQUE style," his 
determination to shun everything conventional in politics. They also speak of a 
stubborn streak. He rejects their advice to get out more, to capitalize on his 
best assets -- the admiration and goodwill many people feel toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Panamanians have become disenchanted with Blades. Back at the Plaza 
Herrera in San Felipe, Eddy Pelletier, a pianist on the 
birthdays-and-private-parties circuit, sidles up and takes a seat by the 
candidate. He wants to vote for Blades, he says, but the campaign has been 
something of a mystery to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to help but we don't know how," Pelletier tells Blades. "We're lost. 
We are people who want change but we feel like we're not being taken into 
account. I listen to all the news on TV and radio, and I haven't heard a thing 
(about the Blades campaign). And there are a bunch of people like me." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are moments when the celebrity entertainer and the candidate blend. 
Blades has recorded the Papa Egoro campaign theme song, a classic salsa 
arrangement that tells people "the change is coming." The tune is getting air 
time on Panamanian radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending one lull in his public appearances, Blades drops in on a post-Carnival 
salsa festival to greet his old buddies from Puerto Rico's Gran Combo 
orchestra. Sponsored by the Panama Kiwanis Club, the festivities open with 
elaborate, sparkling floats that glide down oceanfront Balboa Avenue, carrying 
beauty queens decked out in mammoth headdresses of multicolored feathers. The 
music follows and Blades arrives, pushing his way through a crowd clearly 
delighted to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bats are dive-bombing under a full moon as he strides onto the bandstand to 
greet the musicians, famous in this part of the world for their classic, 
"Brujeria" ("Witchcraft"). The men embrace. The crowd roars. "Amame toda la 
vida," Blades sings, dancing a few steps in more-or-less unison with the 
graying salsa stars, "Love me for a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage, one person after another puts an arm around Blades, takes him 
aside, slaps his back or confides a memory. Many relay their concern that he is 
behind in the polls. "Don't worry," he tells them. "Little by little." 
</P>
<P>
 A television personality in a purple miniskirt comes up to shake his hand. 
"You have my vote," she whispers in his ear. 
</P>
<P>
 He is called back for an encore with the band and again the crowd is ecstatic, 
hooting and cheering. No political speeches are given, no mention of the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert is televised, however, so Blades has just gotten some free 
publicity. But is it the image he wants to convey? Already, cartoons in the 
unfriendly local press portray him as a pair of maracas. 
</P>
<P>
 IF BLADES IS A STAR ATTRACTION in this race, there are plenty of sideshows 
that are threatening to upstage him. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there is The Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver-haired and thick-necked, Ernesto Perez Balladares has marched to the 
head of the polls as the candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party, the 
onetime political arm of Gen. Noriega. His towering bulk earned him the 
universally used nickname "El Toro."  
</P>
<P>
 The thousands of Panamanians who are cheering Perez Balladares are not asking 
for Noriega to return. They are angry at the Endara government, which they see 
as elitist and racist. They have been hurt by rising unemployment, cuts in 
public-sector benefits and declining buying power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic Revolutionary Party, declared dead when Noriega was captured 
after the 1989 invasion and jailed in Miami on drug charges, has expertly 
managed to exploit the discontent. Its association with Noriega and the 
military, however, frightens some people, and opponents are hoping to use that 
against Perez Balladares, a tireless campaigner and multimillionaire 
businessman and coffee exporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Balladares is trying to distance the party from Noriega and emphasize 
its historical ties to Gen. Omar Torrijos, the larger-than-life strongman who 
overthrew an elected president in 1968 and governed until his 1981 death in a 
still-mysterious airplane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his iron-fist rule, Torrijos was admired by many Panamanians because 
of his attention to the poor. This is evident in the lower-middle-class 
neighborhood of Juan Diaz, on the outskirts of Panama City, where a rally for 
Perez Balladares is getting under way at dusk. Hundreds of people filling the 
roughly paved streets to greet El Toro remember that Torrijos built the 
neighborhood, helped them own homes and gave them electricity. "PRD, toda la 
vida!" shouts Vilma de Cedas, a 59-year-old mother of seven who is dressed in 
party colors of red, white and blue. A band of trumpets and drums marches 
along, playing festive Carnival songs as the crowd lets loose. 
</P>
<P>
 While the elections mark the resurrection of Noriega's old party, they also 
have ushered in the demise of the ruling center-right coalition installed after 
the U.S. invasion. Endara is ineligible for another term, leaving coalition 
members to fight bitterly over who should be its candidate, until finally the 
alliance split. The parties are running separate candidates, including the 
remarried widow of Arnulfo Arias, a legendary civilian politician who was 
thrice elected president in the 1940s and '60s and was thrice overthrown by the 
army, and Ruben Dario Carles, the 73-year-old former comptroller known for his 
cantankerous personality and tightfisted management. 
</P>
<P>
 Carles also served in government in the 1950s and represents those Panamanians 
known as rabiblancos, a pejorative term for the white aristocracy that 
periodically -- and currently -- rules over the mostly dark-skinned populace. 
</P>
<P>
 With his trademark bow tie, Carles (said to be a favorite of the U.S. Embassy 
because of his eagerness to pay the foreign debt) is showing considerable 
strength in polls, at times surpassing Blades. Both are still far behind Perez 
Balladares, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghosts that haunt Perez Balladares and Carles can work to Blades' 
advantage because he does not bring similar baggage to the race. But Blades is 
dogged by criticism about his long absence from the country. He has a 
credibility problem among those Panamanians who ask where he was when they were 
here suffering. How can he understand Panama's problems? 
</P>
<P>
 Blades, who says he visited Panama through all the years he lived in the 
States, maintains it is not necessary for him to be here constantly to know 
what's going on. That is what Papa Egoro is for. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is true that I got off a plane from California," he says. "The good news 
is that the party did not get off with me. The party is from here in Panama. It 
was made here in Panama, formed by Panamanians, its proposals are Panamanian." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he adds, "I don't think those who have been here (all along) have 
done such a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 His credibility problem is worsened by the fact that his wife, California 
native Lisa Blades, has not moved to Panama from their home in Santa Monica. 
Some Panamanians wonder how serious Blades can be if his wife lives in another 
country. The 31-year-old actress has visited Panama to help her husband 
campaign. But in a telephone interview from Santa Monica, she is noncommittal 
about making a permanent break from California. 
</P>
<P>
 Credibility is also an issue, Blades acknowledges, with professionals, some 
intellectuals and other Panamanians who have wanted to dismiss him as nothing 
more than a singer. "We called people from the professional ranks (to join the 
party), but they didn't come," Blades says. "They didn't come because they 
weren't sure." 
</P>
<P>
 But Blades also says that the same politicians who attack him as unfit to be 
president offered him a place on their tickets. A spokesman for the PRD 
confirms that the party had proposed a possible alliance, but nothing came of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same people who were calling us folkloric, bohemians, leftists, 
improvisers, madmen, musicians, lined up, lined up, to say, 'Well, for the good 
of the country, we ought to consider forming alliances,' " Blades says, 
bitterness in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 THIS POLITICS BUSINESS HAS turned out to be much more difficult, much more 
challenging than Blades expected. Harder than touring, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Papa Egoro movement has been plagued by desertions of disgruntled members 
who say that Blades and other senior leaders of the party are acting like a 
private club -- a tightknit cabal of intellectuals who control all decisions 
and where being a Friend of Ruben is what counts most. 
</P>
<P>
 "Papa Egoro is not a political party," says Milagros Yanis, a former party 
official who resigned in 1992. "It is a grouping of people where one single 
person decides everything that is said or done. If Ruben leaves, Papa Egoro 
does not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Blades says most of the complaints come from people who did not get the kind 
of access and power they wanted. Even in a democracy, he says, someone has to 
make ultimate decisions. The most serious rifts, he says, spring from the 
diversity of the people brought together in Papa Egoro.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am friends with the guy who lives in Curundu and the guy who lives in 
Paitilla," Blades says, referring to one of Panama City's poorest slums and one 
of its most elegant residential areas. "With one, I went to school; the other I 
knew later. So when the guy from Curundu and the guy from Paitilla meet in a 
room, we are not only deciding a political agenda but also resolving suspicions 
that exist among different economic groups in Panama -- racism, sexism, 
everything. This is a cultural change, and that is not easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Blades has had a rocky relationship with Panamanian newspapers and television 
stations, which are largely controlled by traditional political parties or 
business interests, the Establishment whose nose Blades so enjoys tweaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Mendoza would be considered part of that Establishment. He is the 
publisher of the Panama America newspaper and sits on the board overseeing the 
return of canal lands to Panama. Mendoza does not support Blades, but he thinks 
he could be more successful if he could overcome his reticence. "There is 
something naively messianic about Ruben," Mendoza says. "If he could be 
himself, let his true personality out, he would be a much better candidate. He 
could sell his personality and people would love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Blades is sensitive to the attacks, which range from accusations that he is 
stingy for not putting his own money into the campaign ("The value of my 
'fortune' has been very exaggerated. People think that because I made a movie 
with Jack Nicholson, I was paid the same as Jack") to the fact that his wife is 
a blue-eyed, blond American. 
</P>
<P>
 Blades came under more criticism for interrupting the campaign to rush back to 
Santa Monica after the January earthquake, which damaged his house. An Op-Ed 
piece in one newspaper, lamenting the death of Panama's political class, 
referred to Blades as a "tourist in Creole politics." 
</P>
<P>
 "If what we are doing is madness, then it is a noble madness," he says. "We 
must do this independent of whether we win or not. We lose if we do not try. 
The artist does not see impossibles."  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, Blades speaks in an energetic, animated flurry, where he 
might take on the speaking parts of several characters in a story he is 
telling, or hunch over to imitate a jockey riding in the race of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, as we talk about the past, he becomes quiet. When he returned to 
Panama last year, he recalls seeing a hardness and desperation in the eyes of 
many people, an emptiness that reminds him of a young boy he once met on 
Panama's Coiba penal island, a hellacious prison he visited in 1973 as part of 
a university thesis. He is moved by the recollection. He fights tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot maintain yourself at the margins of this," he says. "The moment 
comes when you have to reach a decision. You are living better than the people 
you wrote (songs) about. And there is something in that which is not good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time comes you have to put yourself in the line of fire, you have to earn 
the right. You're sitting up in your pretty house, playing the guitar and 
singing about the people below. Well, go down below where they are. That's what 
we are doing. For me, it is a moral question, a question of integrity."

ANTELOPE VALLEY RESIDENTS SPLIT ON STATE TEST DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A showdown between local and state officials over a controversial standardized 
test for schoolchildren left some residents rallying support for their side 
Saturday while others were critical of both. 
</P>
<P>
 After a majority of the Antelope Valley Union High School District board voted 
to refuse to administer the California Learning Assessment System test, state 
education officials threatened to seek their removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first thought was, 'Could they do it tomorrow?' " said Mike Kaplan, the 
father of two children who attend school in the district. "Let's just remove 
them and get back to more positive things for the kids out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But others saw the threat by the state Department of Education as a clear 
attack on local control of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting closer to Germany," said Carolyn Steinke, a chapter director 
for the nationwide Eagle Forum, a conservative women's group. "Whatever 
happened to district control? This is what the true issue is: parents' rights 
and district control." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinke believes the Department of Education's threat will be an opportunity 
to define local control. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the sifting-out process, and we're going to find out who's 
accountable, who has power over what," she said. "Do parents have a say when 
they elect their board officials or is it going to be state-run (schools)?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Education officials Friday advised the district's attorney that 
if the the CLAS test is not administered, the state will either file suit or 
seek to have a grand jury remove the three board members who voted against its 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state Department of Education is not going to roll over on this issue," 
said department spokesman William L. Rukeyser. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley district on Wednesday became the first in California to 
refuse to administer the controversial CLAS exam. At least a dozen school 
districts are allowing parents to exempt their children from the exam, despite 
the Department of Education's position that exemptions are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for the state's position came primarily from those who disagree with 
the school board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of CLAS say the test violates the privacy of parents and students 
and that its literature section denigrates the family. Supporters of the test, 
administered for the first time last year, hail it as a revolutionary method of 
measuring what students think, rather than only what they know. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley district Trustee Bill Olenick, who with Wilda Andrejcik cast 
the dissenting votes, said he is concerned about the possibility of the state 
trying to remove his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want autonomy from the state Department of Education," he said. "I resent 
its role as a big brother (but) would welcome it in a more advisory role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe in local control. There are some local-control issues at stake 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick remains optimistic that board President Billy Pricer and members Sue 
Stokka and Tony Welch will reverse their decision if for no other reason than 
its financial implications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board should not violate state law to make a political statement," 
Olenick said. "The fight is not here in this board room, it's in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
 If the state files a lawsuit, the defense could easily cost $100,000, 
according to lawyers for the school district. The Antelope Valley district is 
only now beginning to recover from a $14-million deficit that forced layoffs 
and program reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 A special meeting has been scheduled for May 5, when the board will gather in 
closed session with lawyers to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Kim Fountain said she is sorry that the state is considering such 
drastic measures, but believes the board has forced such a step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think their action (to not administer the test) is serious enough that 
they should be removed," Fountain said. "If Sacramento has the power to do 
that, they should use that power." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Joanne Opdahl agrees. "They took an oath. And they took an oath to 
uphold the ed code," she said. "Somebody has to be in charge. The local boards 
have certain powers but there are certain things that are deferred to the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary school teacher Linda Munski, also a parent of high school students, 
said she is not opposed to the state's efforts to remove the three board 
members, but said she hopes a different remedy is found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately I would like to see them work it out somehow," said Munski, who 
disagrees with the board's decision to not give the test. "It's going to tear 
the community apart if they keep haggling this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Best, president of the 34th district PTA, which encompasses 81 schools 
from Bishop to Santa Clarita, disagreed with the board's decision, but is 
concerned about the state's response. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it's rather severe," she said. "I would think there could be some way 
to work it out that's not so extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Best: "If anybody wanted them to be removed, it should be (left to) the 
local people. Not that I'm necessarily saying recall." 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer said he is appalled at the state's threat because it violates the 
principal of local control of schools. He said he would welcome any recall 
attempt, believing it would prove that the vast majority of the community 
supports the decision not to administer the test. 
</P>

 Stokka believes the department of education would be making a mistake if it 
tries to have a grand jury remove her, Pricer and Welch from office. "It would 
be very poor public relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Department attorneys have repeatedly said the board's action violates state 
law because the education code mandates the CLAS test be administered. CLAS 
opponents, however, agree that the code requires an assessment test be 
administered, but say the law does not require it to be the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer said the school district's attorney was told Friday by the Department 
of Education that it may seek, through prosecutors, to have a grand jury remove 
the three board members. But Suzanne Childs, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office, said Saturday the district attorney could 
not legally convene a grand jury on the topic if there are any alternative 
recall provisions in state law.

WHEN DISASTER STRIKES, FEMA TEAMS MOBILIZE; ASSISTANCE: MANY WORKERS FOR THE 
FEDERAL AGENCY ARE CATASTROPHE VICTIMS THEMSELVES. THEY'RE PUTTING IN NINE-HOUR 
DAYS, SIX DAYS A WEEK -- AND LIKING IT.

 After Hurricane Hugo in 1989 severely damaged the boat on which she and her 
husband were living off the coast of Charleston, S.C., Ceil Olson dreaded 
having to deal with government officials for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably felt like most people do about government employees: that they 
didn't do anything but collect a paycheck," Olson said. "But I never saw a more 
dedicated, harder-working group of people in my entire life, and I wanted to be 
part of that team." 
</P>
<P>
 She did become part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency team, and now, 
as a reservist, has dropped everything at her home in Austin, Tex., to join 
FEMA teams that have dealt with Hurricane Andrew in South Florida, the floods 
in the Midwest and, now, the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most satisfying thing I have ever done," said Olson, a former 
legal secretary and office manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Although FEMA maintains a reserve force of trained experts in various fields 
to respond to disasters, with each new catastrophe the federal agency also 
hires hundreds of temporary employees to help man disaster application 
facilities. For the Northridge quake, more than 1,500 local people were hired 
for temporary work. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Olson, most of the local hires have also experienced disaster -- in this 
case, the Northridge quake -- and so are likely to be more sympathetic to other 
victims seeking assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a woman . . . berate me up one side and down the other about how I did 
not understand, that I don't have a clue what's going on," Olson said. "I said, 
'No ma'am, I do understand. I've been a disaster victim. My daughter lost her 
home in Hurricane Andrew in Homestead, Fla. I know about that . . . and I'm 
1,500 miles away from home.' She calmed down after that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first days after the Jan. 17 quake, FEMA employees were expected to 
work 14-hour days, seven days a week. Now, they work nine-hour days, six days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five such employees at the Earthquake Service Center in Sherman Oaks 
don't seem to mind the long hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Thibodeaux, 48, suffered only minor damage to her Sherman Oaks home of 
19 years: damage to the chimney and a few cracks. But some rental properties 
she and her husband own suffered more extensive damage, so when a Disaster 
Application Center in Sherman Oaks opened, she went to apply for a Small 
Business Administration loan. 
</P>
<P>
 She saw long lines and harried workers and felt the tension in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so busy that I thought they needed help," said Thibodeaux, who in 1987 
retired after 25 years as an administrator for Pacific Bell. "So I stopped by 
the FEMA employment office in Pasadena. I went in at noon and I was sworn in by 
2 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Thibodeaux is now a supervisor. The long work hours have not affected her. 
"Strangely enough it hasn't bothered me yet," she said. "Maybe it's my approach 
in that I know I don't have to be here working, I want to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to helping victims fill out applications, Thibodeaux has ended up 
doing a lot of counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you have to talk to some people a little longer than others," she 
said. "There is a lot of satisfaction in this job. It makes you feel good." 
</P>

 Gennadiy (Henry) May, 42, of Tarzana, is originally from Minsk, Belarus, in 
the former Soviet Union. In 1988 he was working with a construction crew 
building an underground metro line in northwestern Armenia when a 6.8-magnitude 
earthquake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 200 feet underground and we did not feel a thing," May said. "But 
when we came to the surface a few hours later, we saw all the destruction. We 
began helping dig people out of the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
 May's experience in Armenia helped him deal with the Northridge earthquake, 
but he was motivated to help quake victims here to pay off a personal debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very grateful to this country for what it did for myself and my family 
by accepting us as political refugees," he said. He has been in the United 
States just over two years. "It was an opportunity to pay back a moral debt." 
</P>
<P>
 May, who speaks German and Russian, began as a volunteer interpreter. He was 
hired about a week later after discovering that he had lost his job as a 
cashier at a liquor store that had been severely damaged by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just speaking to people in their own language makes it easier for them," he 
said. "I am doing what I want to do, what I can do. I want to help people. This 
is the reason I spend more time with my colleagues here than my family. But 
they understand."  
</P>

 Mabel Portillo, 37, of Canoga Park ran her own importing and marketing 
company. But the combination of the recession and the Jan. 17 quake led her to 
shut it down. Portillo, who lived in Monterey Park in 1987 when the Whittier 
Narrows quake hit, suffered damage to her condominium. Most of her neighbors 
moved out, but Portillo, despite being without water, electricity or gas, 
decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 With time on her hands, Portillo -- who speaks French, Spanish and some 
Portuguese -- volunteered to translate for some of her neighbors who needed 
assistance at the FEMA centers. 
</P>
<P>
 After making a few trips to the center, a FEMA employer asked her what she was 
doing. After explaining the situation, she was offered a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started the next morning at 8 a.m.," said Portillo, who started as an 
interpreter, then worked registering people and now is a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo said she enjoys work more now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had a job where I had to convince people that they wanted 
something I was selling," she said. "Here, I'm giving people something they 
already want and need. It's really nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have said to me, 'I can't believe how nice you are.' But I just enjoy 
it," she said. 
</P>

 Armineh N. Shabazian of Sherman Oaks is of Armenian descent, but grew up in 
Iran. She and her parents fled Iran during the revolution. When an earthquake 
hit Armenia in 1988, many members of her family were killed. Her father became 
very depressed and died six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "His death affected me a lot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Northridge quake hit, Shabazian saw an opportunity to honor the 
memory of her father and help others as well. Fluent in Farsi, Armenian and 
Russian, she volunteered to interpret. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the memory of my father, I wanted to help," said Shabazian, who never 
before worked outside her home. "I told my husband I'd be out only for a few 
hours, but I ended up staying the whole day." 
</P>
<P>
 Shabazian said she has stayed close to some of those she has helped. The 
Northridge quake has been a painful reminder of the past for many Persians who 
lost everything during the Iranian revolution and Armenians who lost property 
and loved ones in the 1988 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do so much counseling I think I should go into counseling," she said 
jokingly. "I enjoy meeting people and I get emotional with them, even though I 
probably shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think my father would be proud." 
</P>

 Steve Miller, 29, lost his apartment in Sherman Oaks and his job at Bullock's 
in Northridge Fashion Center as a result of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the 6.8-magnitude quake, he slept on the grass at Van 
Nuys-Sherman Oaks Recreation Center. When a Disaster Application Center was set 
up at the park, Miller got in line with hundreds of others expecting to deal 
with uncaring government bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting to apply for unemployment benefits, he instead got a job offer 
to help other quake victims apply for unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If FEMA wasn't around, I don't know what would have happened to me," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he has seen some of his former colleagues from Bullock's and 
others from his old neighborhood in line at the FEMA centers. Sharing stories 
about the disaster with the applicants has been mutually beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time I talked about it, it was more and more therapy for me," Miller 
said. "I could really understand what they are going through. I would tell them 
my story and it would give a little more feeling to the EDD (state Employment 
Development Department)." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who recently moved into a new apartment in North Hollywood, lost about 
half of everything he owned when his apartment collapsed. He and his girlfriend 
also broke up when she decided she had enough of earthquakes and moved back to 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller remains upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am grateful for my life," he said. "I tell people, 'It's going to be OK. 
You've made it this far.' "

STUDENTS SHOW CIVIC PRIDE BY SWEEPING UP SIDEWALKS; EDUCATION: SEPULVEDA MIDDLE 
SCHOOL YOUTHS RETURN A FAVOR BY RESPONDING TO A COUNCILMAN'S CLEANUP CALL.

 More than two dozen youngsters spent Saturday morning sweeping the sidewalks 
along Pacoima's busy Van Nuys Boulevard in an exercise in practical altruism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our community and we want to have pride in it," said Manricio 
Valdovinos, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been their community, but it wasn't their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids were all from Sepulveda Middle School, the only group responding to 
the cleanup call of Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon's Youth 
Improvement Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Francisco Flores said the group was there partly as a favor to the 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alarcon has helped us with tickets to games and buses for trips," Flores 
said. "We've gone to the circus, to the zoo and last week to a World Cup 
festival, where there was a soccer coach from Great Britain teaching the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, said Edgar N. Camacho, 14. "We get points for extracurricular 
activities in a course called 'Leadership,' " Edgar said. "One time we took 
part in an aerobics marathon in a fund-raiser for the American Heart Assn." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores has also told his students that he will be trying to round up summer 
job opportunities. "I tell them I want to see how well they can work," Flores 
said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing should not be overlooked, the teacher added: "These kids could be 
gangbangers, but they are not. Most kids are good." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the incentive, merchants along half a dozen blocks of the boulevard 
were appreciative, donating drinks or offering food without being asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonia Tejada, who runs an immigration service business with her daughter 
Carmen, came out with a $5 bill in hand, hoping to give it to a leader in 
appreciation for the youngsters who swept the small parking lot outside her 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope everybody helps them," she said. "This is very, very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Araya, another Sepulveda Middle School teacher, said, "There are nice 
people around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to several kids drinking from cans of cola near the end of their 
volunteer work, Araya assured them: "We'll be sure to write a letter to the 
principal to let them know what you did today. Everybody's name will be on the 
letter." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you get my name?" asked Ramses Altamirano, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got everybody's name," Araya replied.

VAN NUYS MAN, 67, FATALLY STABBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 67-year-old man was stabbed to death early Saturday inside his Van Nuys 
apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Fred Corthron was stabbed several times in the chest about 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Love, 18, also of Van Nuys, an acquaintance of the victim's, was 
arrested on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Love was arrested at his apartment less than a block away from Corthron's 
Saturday evening after police discovered evidence that they believe linked him 
to the slaying. They said robbery was the apparent motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighbors heard the victim screaming for help," said Detective Steve Fisk of 
the Van Nuys Division of the LAPD. "They went outside and found him in the 
hallway still alive. They took him back in and called paramedics, but he died 
at the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Corthron lived in an apartment complex in the 9500 block of Van Nuys 
Boulevard.

AFTER HIGH-SPEED CHASE, CARJACKING SUSPECT ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A carjacking suspect was in custody Saturday after leading sheriff's deputies 
on a high-speed chase before crashing into their patrol car, injuring the two 
deputies, neither seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the deputies fired a shot at the suspect, Randy Vitolla, 33, but did 
not hit him, said Deputy Angie McLaughlin, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred at 2 p.m. near 120th Street East and Avenue E in an 
unincorporated area of Lancaster after Vitolla posed as a customer at Antelope 
Valley Ford to steal a 1994 red Mustang, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Vitolla ditched car salesman Keenan Rose during a test drive, 
then led deputies on a chase that reached speeds of up to 110 m.p.h. Deputies 
followed by car and helicopter, before Vitolla made a U-turn and crashed 
head-on into the patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitolla suffered only minor injuries, McLaughlin said, and was saved by the 
car's air bag. One of the deputies, none of whom were identified, shot at 
Vitolla after he saw the suspect reach under the car's passenger seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Vitolla was arrested on suspicion of robbery, grand theft auto, attempted 
murder of a peace officer and felony evading arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, the car salesman, said he became suspicious of Vitolla during a 
conversation as the suspect test-drove the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took him for a test drive, he told me he had just been paroled from 
prison," a seemingly unshaken Rose said late Saturday. "And I said, 'It's not a 
problem. We finance parolees.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But as the test drive ended, Rose, 31, of Lancaster, said Vitolla stopped in 
front of the dealership and ordered him to get out.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I ain't getting out of the car," said Rose, who has worked at the 
dealership for two months. "Then he tells me, 'You misunderstood what I am 
saying. I am taking the car, now you can make it hard or easy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said he tried to reason with Vitolla, warning him that the car had little 
gas and that the car was not worth it. But Vitolla reached into his jacket and 
brought out a gym bag, telling Rose he had a gun inside it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Don't do this. They are going to kill you,' " Rose said. "He just 
said get out, and I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said Vitolla was pleasant to him throughout the experience. "He was like 
any other customer," Rose said. "He wanted a vehicle and he got it."

NEW ERA DAWNS FOR LANCASTER CITY COUNCIL; GOVERNMENT: OBSERVERS PREDICT MORE 
DISCUSSION AND DEBATE AFTER THE ELECTION OF TWO OUTSPOKEN ACTIVISTS TO THE 
PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of a dramatic election, City Council meetings here -- marked in 
recent years by a lack of public squabbling and a lot of unanimous votes -- 
could move into a new era of more vocal debates and split votes. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 12, Lancaster voters removed two incumbents, including an eight-year 
council veteran, and replaced them with two outspoken activists supported by a 
homeowners coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Arnie Rodio and George Root, who fiercely defended the use of 
city funds to attract new retail stores, handed over their chairs last week to 
Michael Singer and Deborah Shelton, who campaigned against such incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters returned to office one incumbent, the Rev. Henry Hearns, who has 
characterized himself as a peacemaker eager to hear all sides of an issue. 
Hearns may prove to be the swing vote if Singer and Shelton square off against 
council members Frank Roberts and George Runner, who also support retail 
incentives, but did not face reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents believe philosophical clashes almost certainly will erupt 
more often on the new council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping we see a lot more healthy discussion," said Barbara 
Halley-Merritt, who has been involved in several council campaigns, including 
her own unsuccessful run for office this year. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other candidates charged that the previous council reached decisions 
as a group, then turned a deaf ear to community protests. That will almost 
certainly change now, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that all sides of each issue will be aired in public discussion," 
Halley-Merritt said. "I think Michael and Deborah will force that. I see it as 
a healthy trend, and I think people will welcome it." 
</P>
<P>
 Singer, 41, a county fire captain, and Shelton, 37, who runs an after-school 
help-line for latchkey children, are former presidents of the Lancaster 
Coalition of Neighborhood Organizations. The group, representing 23 homeowner 
associations and about 3,000 households, endorsed both. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, small-business owners, outraged over the previous council's vote 
to subsidize a large new PetSmart store, supported Singer and Shelton. Small 
pet-shop owners, in particular, argued that the city was giving money to a 
large retail store that threatened their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Rodio and Root steadfastly defended their votes, saying PetSmart 
would generate far more than the subsidy in needed sales tax dollars. But after 
finishing fifth and sixth among 13 candidates, the councilmen insisted that the 
uproar over PetSmart cost them their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodio, who helped found the city in 1977 and served eight years on the 
council, has no regrets. "Every vote that I made in the city of Lancaster I 
made from the heart, as something that was good for the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shelton believes Rodio and Root were ousted because "they were not as 
responsive to the citizens as they should have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton and Singer have vowed to vote against future subsidies to large 
retailers and have pledged to make the local governing process more open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Singer has advocated unification of Palmdale and Lancaster. 
Shelton wants to eliminate the council's Monday morning meetings with city 
staff members, saying they are difficult for working residents to attend, and 
she wants to launch volunteer anti-graffiti patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 If a home-building boom resumes in Lancaster, the two will seek growth 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, however, Singer is uncertain how often he and Shelton will clash 
with the other three council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, there seems to be a great willingness to work together," he 
said. "We may see some 3-to-2 votes, particularly with regard to projects that 
are already in motion. But every indication from the sitting council persons is 
that they want to work toward the good of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, veteran council members point out that campaign promises cannot 
always be converted easily into public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Root, a longtime activist for mobile-home residents who won a council seat 
four years ago, said he quickly learned how difficult it is to change a city's 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went in, I expected I could make things happen much quicker," he said. 
"While it appears there's a lot of money sometimes, there really isn't. Much of 
it is already obligated." 
</P>
<P>
 Root said Singer and Shelton must be prepared to compromise and must make sure 
their proposals are supported by a majority of the five council members. "One 
of the most important things they need to learn is how to count to three," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But before she starts counting, Shelton said she must adjust to the dramatic 
leap from gadfly to decision-maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel like an outsider, not an insider," she said after her first 
meeting as a councilwoman. "That big desk is in front of you, and you're 
looking out at the audience . . . I felt separated from the public when I was 
up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton said her greatest challenge will be to retain an outsider's 
perspective at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get isolated from the citizens," she said. "You get surrounded by the 
bureaucracy and you become the bureaucracy. I have to find a way not to let 
that happen."

</P>
<P>
 It's been this way for two months. At 1 a.m., he rolls his 6-foot-2, 325-pound 
body out of bed and stumbles to the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of the TV is a rented movie. Sometimes there are three. 
</P>
<P>
 He sticks one in the VCR, leans back in a chair and searches for the moment 
his eyes will close, his fears will disappear and he will finally accept that 
he deserves it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he deserves being projected as an early second-round pick in today's NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, even though he might be the only player picked who did not attend college 
on an athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, even though two years ago he was living in Compton and not even attending 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, even though he went to four high schools in four cities, played football 
for only two of them and graduated from none. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, even though he has been stabbed, shunned, stood up, slapped down and 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Allen, from Sonoma State tackle to NFL millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The sleeper wonders if he will ever be able to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I close my eyes I think, 'Damn, man, how can this happen?' " Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While selling itself to TV as a coronation of superstars, the NFL draft 
remains rooted in meanings far different. 
</P>
<P>
 The romance that has endured for the 59 years of this exercise is not about 
the destinations of All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 It is about the discovery of Larry Allens. 
</P>
<P>
 For the millions who have watched the draft, the message about football in 
America has always been clear. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can play, the NFL will find you. Somewhere, somehow, the pros will find 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 The league found Allen during routine scouting trips by friends of friends of 
team officials. He was then allowed to play in the East-West Shrine Game and 
Senior Bowl, the thought being that he would be exposed by top competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But in both games, this soft-spoken giant dominated opponents with an 
unmatched ferocity. Scouts say he pounded heralded University of Miami 
defensive lineman Darren Krein so badly that Krein quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm on the field, I'm like a gang-banger," Allen said quietly. "I hit as 
hard as I can for as long as I can. I think maybe I'm taking out all my 
frustrations about my life." 
</P>
<P>
 After probing his body and his past for the last two months, league officials 
promise that today or Monday, that frustration will end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry Allen is a great story," said Carl Peterson, general manager of the 
Kansas City Chiefs and former Sonoma State coach. "Been through a lot in his 
life, bounced around a few places, but now, somebody is going to give him a 
real good opportunity. Second round -- or even higher." 
</P>
<P>
 That opportunity will mark the first time in the 16-year history of Sonoma 
State football that a player from there has been taken in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the Division II program not give athletic scholarships, it has 
only three full-time coaches and a stadium with no lights and one set of 
bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent spring practice, the best moves were performed by a running 
back who leaped over a small boy playing on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The loudest voice belonged to the volunteer line coach, a computer science 
teacher at a local high school. 
</P>
<P>
 What must Allen have thought when he arrived here from Compton two years ago, 
his luck on empty, his opportunities drained?. 
</P>
<P>
 What must he have thought as he was driven from gang turf and barred windows 
to this hilly, picturesque spot an hour north of San Francisco?. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe how quiet it was here," Allen said. "At first I thought, 
'Where am I?' But then I realized, this was my last chance. I had to do it 
here, or nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, he was so familiar with nowhere he could have given tours. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 9-year-old in Compton, he was stabbed 12 times in the head and shoulder 
during a fight with a playmate whose mother had given him a knife. 
</P>
<P>
 After a massive stitching job at the hospital, he became so frightened of 
needles that today he won't even allow his dentist to administer Novocain 
before filling a cavity. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he reached adolescence, his parents had separated. His mother took 
him to Northern California to escape the bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say those bullets were how Allen developed what scouts calls incredible 
quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would hear the gunfire outside our house, we would automatically roll out 
of the bed, lay on the floor until the shooting stopped, then get back in bed 
and go to sleep," said his mother, Vera. "After a while, we got pretty good at 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he could not afford to play Pop Warner football, he needed to work up 
the courage before joining the freshman team at his first high school in 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly after he signed up, his mother moved to Fairfield, which meant a 
change of schools. Uncomfortable in a new environment, he sat out his sophomore 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was ready to play again, he had moved again, back to Compton, 
where he donned shoulder pads for the first time as a junior at Centennial 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had stayed there, he might have been recruited by major schools. But 
with drug deals taking place outside his house, with gang activity forcing him 
to leave certain colored clothing in his closet, he asked his mother if he 
could return to Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent his senior year at a high school in Napa. With no diploma, and no SAT 
scores because he had never felt secure enough to make arrangements to take the 
test, he was of no use to interested major colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 So he enrolled in Butte Junior College in Oroville. By his second year there, 
he realized his chances of staying with football, or even in school, were slim. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no money. His mother had no money. 
</P>
<P>
 Once when he called home and told her he was hungry, she rushed down to a 
Western Union office in Compton with her last $32. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cost me $13 to wire him $15," Vera recalled. "That was $28, and the man 
behind the counter thought it was a little silly. He wondered if I couldn't 
just mail him the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Mister, my son is hungry now ." 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion at Butte when he was broke, Allen said he sold his 
athletic jacket to a drug dealer for a chance to sell rock cocaine with a 
friend on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a police car drove past, I got scared, threw the bag in the bushes, and 
haven't been near the stuff since," he recalled. "That just wasn't me." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen returned home after his second year at Oroville, with no associate 
degree or direction. He had only the memories, growing ever distant, of 
something he once had heard about his potential. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved back into his mother's house in Compton, borrowed plastic drugstore 
weights from a cousin and spent his days lifting those and watching TV. Lifting 
and watching and wondering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those weights were tiny," he said. "I would lift them 100 times. Every day, 
at least 100 times. I didn't know what I was waiting for. I was just, you know, 
waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 While he waited, Frank Scalercio, then an assistant coach at Sonoma, was 
searching. Scalercio had seen Allen dominate opponents at Butte, then heard 
that he had quit school. 
</P>
<P>
 In his previous nine years as an assistant at Sonoma, Scalercio had made a 
habit of bringing youngsters from South-Central Los Angeles to the college and 
teaching them about life. About 10 such athletes play for the Cossacks every 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 In Allen, he saw another such project. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I couldn't find him," Scalercio said. "His phone number kept changing as 
he moved around town. Friends kept seeing him, then not seeing him." 
</P>
<P>
 Using every available contact in the Compton area, Scalercio finally reached 
Allen after nearly three months of trying. Allen picked up the phone, heard 
Scalercio's pitch, and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never heard of Sonoma State," Allen said. "I thought it was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother finally persuaded him to give the rural college a chance. He showed 
up with his clothes piled into garbage bags in the back of another student's 
pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 After his first 10 minutes on the field, Scalercio knew it was not merely 
another risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first practice, he was killing people," said Scalercio, who became head 
coach this year. "He was so mean. It was real ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost as ugly as what was happening off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was so big, many in the Santa Rosa area stared at him. He interpreted 
these stares as challenges. There were several bloody, late-night fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a small guy in town would challenge him, then a bigger guy, then 
a bigger guy," Scalercio said. "I had to teach him, like I have to teach a lot 
of our kids, that what the look may mean in South-Central, it means something 
different here." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than half of his team from inner-city areas throughout California, 
Scalercio spends much of his time helping players adjust. Allen eventually 
stopped fighting and now sells his skills there as a paid bouncer and security 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 But some adjustments couldn't be made. Like the time Sonoma was playing at 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Vera Allen's only chance to see her son play, but she doesn't have a 
car. So she and her other son boarded a city bus in Compton for a three-hour 
ride to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw my mom afterward, and really wanted to visit with her, but she had to 
catch that bus home," Allen recalled. "That was really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 After dodging rats and drunks at the downtown station, Vera and her son 
arrived back in Compton at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I really want to do is buy my mother a car," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 With impending fame, though, has come other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen gives away so much money to friends that Scalercio budgets his financial 
aid check, putting equal amounts in envelopes that are given to him weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 When a boy recently asked Allen for his autograph, Allen walked into his 
Scalercio's office, pulled a color photograph off the wall, signed the picture, 
and handed it to the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't tell this to defensive linemen, but the other day, Allen and his 
girlfriend took a niece to Chuck E. Cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all this is over, all I want is a place near a beach," Allen said. "I 
want to be able to walk to the sand, throw down a blanket and look at the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 He was reminded that, like needles and airplanes, he is also afraid of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't matter," he said. "It's quiet there. It's pretty there. I just want 
to spend all day looking."

DODGER COLLISION PROVES COSTLY; BASEBALL: DESHIELDS IS HOSPITALIZED AFTER 
RUNNING INTO MONDESI. THE EXPOS RALLY FROM 5-0 DEFICIT TO BEAT L.A., 8-6, IN 
11TH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a frightening accident at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, Delino 
DeShields collided with Raul Mondesi on a fielding play, was knocked 
unconscious for a short time and was taken by ambulance to Centinela Hospital 
Medical Center in Inglewood, where he was admitted for X-rays and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 He suffered a concussion and was being held overnight for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montreal Expos, after rallying to tie the score in the ninth inning, beat 
the Dodgers, 8-6, in the 11th on a two-run home run by Lenny Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seventh inning, DeShields, going back on a pop fly hit by Mike Lansing, 
collided with Mondesi near the right-field line about 20 feet beyond the 
infield. He spun around, landed hard on his back and lay motionless as trainers 
and players ran to his side. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields regained consciousness before he was helped onto a stretcher and 
rolled into an ambulance, which entered through the center-field gates and 
waited on the warning track in short right field, near where DeShields had lain 
for about 14 minutes with little movement. Mondesi, who somehow held onto the 
ball, took several steps before he too, collapsed, but he recovered quickly and 
stayed in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 DeShields and Mondesi were watching the ball all the way, with Mondesi 
charging from right field. DeShields was reaching for the ball when Mondesi hit 
him from behind, and he went down hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda called for a doctor, and Joel Fechter of the Kerlan-Jobe 
Orthopaedic Clinic ran to DeShields. When DeShields arrived at the hospital, he 
was met by Drs. Glenn Reinhart and Michael Mellman, the team physician. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision came with the Dodgers leading the Expos, 6-2, before 39,167. As 
Expo Marquis Grissom, DeShields' best friend, looked on, play was stopped for 
16 minutes. When the seventh inning resumed, the Expos rallied for three runs 
to pull within 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth against Todd Worrell, Grissom walked, stole second and third and 
scored on a sacrifice fly by pinch-hitter Randy Milligan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11th against Roger McDowell (0-1), Larry Walker singled and scored on 
Webster's homer. 
</P>
<P>
 For DeShields, the accident was the latest obstacle in what has become a 
difficult transition with his new team. The trade to the Dodgers for Pedro 
Martinez took him by surprise, as it did his teammates, and he had said he 
missed his former team greatly.  
</P>
<P>
 In spring training, the week before the season began, DeShields suffered a 
broken cheekbone in a freak accident in the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields had out-patient surgery on his cheekbone and had to wear a 
protective mask for a couple of games. But he healed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the season started, a 15-year-old injury began to act up, 
leaving DeShields' left thigh weak. It has impaired his ability to hit and 
limited his lateral movement in the field. Sometimes, he even has trouble 
getting a jump out of the batter's box. He batted .125 on the team's eight-game 
trip and was batting .200 before Saturday's game.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers scored three runs in the first inning and two in the second to 
take a 5-0 lead. With one out in the first inning, Brett Butler drew a walk 
from Rodney Henderson, who made his first major league start and his second 
appearance ever in the majors. Mike Piazza doubled in Butler and Tim Wallach 
took Henderson deep into the left-field pavilion for a two-run homer.  
</P>
<P>
 In the second inning, DeShields drove in two runs when he hit an 
opposite-field flare through the hole to left field. After the Expos' Walker 
hit a two-run single, Henry Rodriguez homered in the bottom of the third to 
make the score 6-2.  
</P>
<P>
 But after DeShields was taken away by ambulance in the seventh inning, the 
Expos rallied against starter Ramon Martinez for three runs. Grissom tripled in 
two runs and then scored on a groundout.  
</P>
<P>
 DeShields and Grissom, who came up in the minors together, spent time together 
after Friday night's game. Best friends, DeShields said it was good for him to 
to talk with Grissom about the struggles he has had this season.

JIM MURRAY: MAYBE THIS GUY IS THE GREATEST THERE EVER WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Michael Jordan, the world's greatest basketball player, opted out of his 
sport and elected to play baseball, the sporting community, and particularly 
the sporting press, was widely divided in its reaction. About 75% were outraged 
and hoped he would fall on his bald pate. I mean, who did he think he was? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, one sport and one sport alone was good enough for Babe Ruth, Ty 
Cobb, Henry Aaron and Willie Mays, wasn't it? What was this guy trying to 
prove? 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the sport itself snickered behind its hand. Relief pitchers allowed as 
how they had a better chance of playing the pivot for the Chicago Bulls than 
Michael Jordan had of succeeding in baseball. They couldn't wait to show him a 
major league changeup. It was predicted he would throw his back out trying to 
hit one.  
</P>
<P>
 They felt intensely territorial about their sport. Their thrust was, go back 
to that sport played on wood floors, Michael. You can't slam dunk a baseball. 
Besides, it's too small for a guy used to the dimensions of a basketball. 
Michael had delusions of grandeur. Major league baseball was not mumbletypeg or 
one-o'cat in the park.  
</P>
<P>
 You had to feel that, secretly, some of them were afraid Jordan would show 
them -- and the game -- up. What if he came in and started hitting three home 
runs a game? What if he was the world's greatest athlete? 
</P>
<P>
 I have a diametrically opposite viewpoint from my learned colleagues. I hope 
Michael Jordan succeeds beyond his wildest expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: If you went into any part of this country where young athletes 
congregate and you came upon a youngster who gave indication he could be 
superbly talented in any sport he chose, what sport do you think he would 
settle on? 
</P>
<P>
 No contest. Slam dunk. It would be basketball. Baseball, I have to think, 
would be a poor third. Maybe fourth.  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always this way in this country. Every red-blooded American boy once 
hankered to be a bona fide major league baseball star.  
</P>
<P>
 It's no longer true. The sandlot diamond is disappearing. The game is thriving 
mostly in the Caribbean.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what the population of the Dominican Republic is, but every 
second kid seems to be in a baseball lineup somewhere. If Cubans were allowed 
to play here, they'd have to call balls and strikes in Spanish.  
</P>
<P>
 So, my notion is, Michael Jordan honors baseball -- ennobles it, if you will. 
He's reversing a trend, is what he's doing. And he's not opting for golf, as so 
many thought he would. Or for football, or for tennis, or for boxing, at which, 
given his speed and power and peripheral vision, I would guess he would be 
terrific. No, what Michael is dreaming about is becoming a star in our national 
pastime. And this is no Walter Mitty. This is one of the great athletic 
specimens of his time.  
</P>
<P>
 You know how kids buy his shoes at his urging, down his soft drink, purchase 
tank tops with his number? You think they're not going to pay attention to his 
choice of sport? 
</P>
<P>
 It's my notion baseball couldn't buy that kind of endorsement. So, far from 
running him out of here at the end of a sharp pen, the game should have a light 
in the window. They should light candles and pray that he succeeds.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a switch that has never been notably successful. The most publicized of 
failures in antiquity was that of Jim Thorpe. There wasn't much Jim Thorpe 
couldn't do with a football. He could kick it, throw it, run with it or block 
it with the best who ever lived. There wasn't much he couldn't do on a track, 
either. He could throw the discus and javelin, jump high, run fast. The King of 
Sweden, no less, once proclaimed him the world's greatest athlete -- and there 
was no argument.  
</P>
<P>
 But that little old major league curveball -- what Roy Campanella once 
proclaimed "Public Enemy No. 1" -- proved his undoing. The Baseball 
Encyclopedia lists Thorpe's six-year major league career as a frustrating 
experiment in which he hit .252 (not bad by today's standards but abysmal by 
his era's standards). You find only seven home runs there, 82 runs batted in 
and a whole lot of strikeouts -- 122 in his relatively few at-bats.  
</P>
<P>
 Track stars tend to do better in football than baseball. A great base stealer 
is demoralizing -- but first he has to get on base. But there are few 
basketball players who made it in baseball. Chuck Connors and Gene Conley, 
neither a big court star, played in the majors. Jordan is the only superstar to 
switch.  
</P>
<P>
 So, Michael opting for the grand old game should be saluted at the highest 
levels. First of all, he's putting his sport's reputation on the line. That is 
admirable. Great actors don't tackle ballet. Great musicians don't play Hamlet. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But Jordan, at the age of 31, is delving into the arts and mysteries of 
baseball. It's a game in which the ability to hover in the air and circle the 
playing field for long periods of time is of minimal usefulness.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, he did pick baseball. It reminds me of the oft-repeated observation of 
the late Fresco Thompson when he was signing rookies for the Dodgers. Whenever 
a kid would come in the office and say "Mr. Thompson, I think I can make it in 
one of two sports but I'm torn between pro football and major league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kid," Fresco would growl," what do you want -- a career or a limp?" 
</P>
<P>
 Michael was not in a sport where the occupational hazard was a limp. But he 
was in one where the ball was full of air. And was hard to miss -- 30 inches in 
circumference vs. a baseball's nine.  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball should be glad it's got him. I bet hockey wishes he could skate.

MIKE DOWNEY: IF YOU MUST SMOKE, TRY IT IN SINGAPORE

 Marge Schott, the Cincinnati Red menace, recently threatened to defy a city 
crackdown on smoking at the stadium. She intended to sit there in her owner's 
box and puff away to her heart's content, if not her lungs'. Between the 
souvenirs left on the field by Schott's dog and the aroma from her cigarettes, 
the Reds could become the first team in baseball history to play with 
clothespins on their noses.  
</P>
<P>
 I have three suggestions on how to treat people who smoke at a baseball game:  
</P>
<P>
 1. Evict them from the park. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Arrest them.  
</P>
<P>
 3. Send them to Singapore to be caned.  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is a game stained by tobacco, from the toxic drool spilling down 
Lenny Dykstra's jaw to the seventh-inning smokes occasionally sneaked by 
Pittsburgh Manager Jim Leyland, much the way Baltimore's human chimney, Earl 
Weaver once did. Ballplayers dip it, sniff it, smoke it, chomp it, spit it and 
even wrap bubble gum around it like a burrito, if you can imagine that.  
</P>
<P>
 One difference, though.  
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to sit next to the players.  
</P>
<P>
 Their tobacco doesn't make you cough. Their nicotine doesn't end up 
contaminating your clothes. Their use of proven carcinogens might be a poor 
influence for children and more than a tad disgusting, but at least they stay 
far enough away that it doesn't directly affect your enjoyment of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Some parks don't need Helmet Night or Camera Night, though.  
</P>
<P>
 They need Oxygen Mask Night.  
</P>
<P>
 It has been a while, but I have been in the stands of a baseball game when the 
guy seated next to me put a match to a cigar the size of Benny Goodman's 
clarinet. Back when thousands smoked, no single offender presented a problem. 
Nowadays, though, you can tell if somebody has lit up seven rows away. The 
smoke comes blowing at you like a backdraft from a Ron Howard film. If the 
vendor sold marshmallows, you could toast them.  
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere else, you could change your seat. But not with a specific ticket. 
Seated beside certain companions, you could appeal to the smoker to desist out 
of friendship. With a stranger, though, your options are greatly reduced.  
</P>
<P>
 You can ask the person to extinguish the smoke, thereby risking a nasty 
argument and possibly being clubbed with a souvenir bobbing-head doll. Or, you 
can tattle to an usher, which endears you to nobody and makes you feel like a 
little rat.  
</P>
<P>
 This also complicates the life of the usher, who already has enough trouble 
hopping around like a bullfrog from aisle to aisle trying to intercept all 
those beach balls.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and imagine sicking an usher on Marge Schott.  
</P>
<P>
 "That woman's cigarette is bothering me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Which woman?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That one. Right there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, I don't see any woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing as how she is the head Red, nobody short of the fire marshal is going 
to have the guts to tell Marge Schott to get her ash out of there. Luckily for 
the health and welfare of Ohioans who adore baseball but aren't all that wild 
about cancer, last week Schott reluctantly agreed to trudge upstairs to her 
private humidor whenever she feels the need for a few drags. Much obliged, 
Marge. Smoke 'em in good health.  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball is doing better. Most parks have specified smoking areas, or no 
smoking at all. The minor leagues are even more strict, even recently scolding 
Birmingham outfielder Michael Jordan for being spotted inside the dugout with a 
cigar. They don't want to see anything hanging from Mike's mouth but his 
tongue.  
</P>
<P>
 If, by chance, you ever do sit next to smokers at a baseball game, here are a 
few tricks you can use to fight back:  
</P>
<P>
 -- Take off your shoes. Fight fumes with fumes.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Talk about Tom and Roseanne Arnold. They will get bored and change their 
seats.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Pretend this is your first game. Ask dozens of dumb questions. "How can he 
throw a knuckleball with his knuckles?" "Are any of these guys Reggie?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Put things on your hot dog that will gross them out.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Blow really big bubbles. If necessary, use gum.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Discuss all the great Texas Ranger games in baseball history.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Pay a cute child to approach the smoker and say, "Lady, is it true your 
lungs are purple?"

ATLAS PUTS THE WEIGHT ON HIS SHOULDERS; BOXING: MOORER'S TRAINER SEES DEFEAT 
LOOMING -- AND TAKES AN UNUSUAL STEP TO TURN THE FIGHT'S TIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Teddy Atlas decided he couldn't stand for what was happening, so he decided to 
sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat on his fighter's stool, between rounds of a heavyweight title fight, 
with Michael Moorer gaping down at his trainer as if Atlas were crazy. Atlas 
concedes that is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to cry tomorrow!" Atlas screamed at Moorer. "Do you want to cry 
tomorrow?" 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, shocked into obedience, could only reply: "No." Atlas shrugged. 
Eventually, Atlas let him have his stool back, and Moorer went on to win the 
heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In one more sign that Moorer and Atlas have a heavyweight title relationship 
that moves to an immeasurably different beat, one of the key moments of 
Moorer's majority-decision victory over Evander Holyfield on Friday night 
occurred after the eighth round, when Atlas sensed that Moorer was losing 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 As Moorer returned to his corner, he was greeted by a grumpy Atlas, demanding 
answers, perched on Moorer's stool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it because I thought the fight was getting to the mode where Michael 
was satisfied just to be there and he was doing enough to lose some rounds, 
just trying to survive," Atlas said Saturday. "And I wasn't going to cooperate 
with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just came to me. I had to do something I thought very dramatic. I know 
Michael, so whereas it might be extra dramatic to someone else, it was 
necessary and urgent to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer, who dominated the early-to-middle rounds with an aggressive right jab 
that had Holyfield out of kilter and bleeding heavily over his left eye despite 
having knocked Moorer down in the second, started slowing down in the seventh. 
Holyfield, though badly damaged, was edging back into control. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it continued to go that way, it would just be a matter of time before 
Holyfield realized it and didn't allow him to survive," Atlas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just sat on the stool and said, 'You don't want to fight. You don't want to 
win this damn thing, so I'll fight. Get outside, give me the water and I'll 
take your place.' And I made him say to me that he wanted to fight before I 
would get up. I said, 'You don't want to fight.' He said, 'No, I do.' Thank 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer laughed when he was asked what he was thinking while Atlas looked up at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was the craziest cornerman in the world," Moorer said Saturday. 
"But Teddy doesn't care if you think he's crazy, he doesn't care what people 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas' antics in between the seventh and eighth were a highlight of his 
motivational techniques from the first day he met the moody Moorer about a year 
ago to the final round of his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Moorer's manager, John Davimos: "I don't know if Michael could have done 
this without Teddy Atlas." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking as if he had fought 12 rounds himself on Saturday, Atlas said he had 
never had to be on top of a fighter as much as he had to with Moorer, a 
talented fighter with an inconsistent nature. 
</P>
<P>
 So even as Moorer, who has never hidden his disdain for much of the boxing 
world, hesitated to say how long he wanted to defend his title, Atlas said he 
didn't know if he could ever go through the emotional wringer of working with 
Moorer again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning the title usually helps your confidence and you feel secure about 
yourself . . . you get to where you respect the title and it just improves 
you," Atlas said. "That should help. But somebody's probably going to have to 
stay on him -- I don't know if it'll be me. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very . . . testing." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, Atlas' original game plan -- smash Holyfield with the right 
jab, watch him wear down at the end of the fight -- worked perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer who doubled as a cutman Friday, said he 
understood that he will receive a lot of blame for the defeat after taking over 
from Emanuel Steward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can swim with sharks, and I won't get bit," Turner said. "I knew what I was 
getting into." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Moorer and Holyfield ended up in the hospital after the fight with sore 
left arms, but nobody was saying the fight was decided by arm troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the timing was right from the first time we made the fight," Atlas 
said. "Evander had moved past a certain plateau. I thought he'd fought a lot of 
tough fights. . . . He's 31 years old. . . . I thought those tough fights were 
going to take a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went against what everyone thought -- that we had to knock him out early or 
something. I felt if we got confidence and we were there in the later rounds, 
we would only get better. (Moorer would) start saying, 'I could do this, I 
could do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What's next for the new International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Assn. 
champion? Moorer didn't say, other than he wanted a lot of rest and that he 
would appear on "The Late Show With David Letterman" Tuesday night. Davimos, 
however, suggested that a rematch with Holyfield, if the former champion 
doesn't retire, is not out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly Finkel, Holyfield's manager, said he would file a protest over the 
scoring in the second round in order to maintain Holyfield's rights -- 
rematches are encouraged by the sanctioning bodies if there is controversy 
involved in the first fight -- if he decides to return to the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Holyfield knocked Moorer down at the end of the second round, which 
generally results in a 10-8 round score, judge Jerry Roth scored the round 
even, 10-10, giving Moorer credit for controlling the first part of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 If Roth scores the round 10-9 for Holyfield, his overall score changes to 
114-114, matching judge Dalby Shirley's even score, which would have made the 
fight a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 But no protest, Finkel said, would take away the fact that Moorer won the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be better with the title," Davimos said. "In my mind, Michael's an 
insecure kid. The title will help him become a man. He's not a bad kid, he just 
has insecurities that have caused him trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to think winning the championship will help you alleviate some of 
those insecurities." 
</P>
<P>
 With World Boxing Council champion Lennox Lewis and Riddick Bowe as the two 
names drawing the most big-money attention, Davimos indicated that Lewis would 
be a more likely choice. 
</P>
<P>
 And will Atlas be there for Moorer's next fight? 
</P>
<P>
 "Either he'll be there with Michael," Davimos said, "or I'll kill Teddy 
myself." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A replay of the Michael Moorer-Evander Holyfield heavyweight championship 
fight will be shown Wednesday night at 10 on HBO, the pay-cable service 
announced.

STATUS OF DILFER MIGHT BE THE KEY; RAMS: THEY MAY TRADE DOWN FOR ANOTHER PICK 
IF QUARTERBACK IS NOT THERE WHEN L.A. CHOOSES FIFTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams won, and so they lost. They beat the Chicago Bears on the final day 
of a forgettable 5-11 season and plunged from second to fifth in the first 
round of today's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being in the hunt for San Diego State's Marshall Faulk, Ohio 
State's Dan Wilkinson, Tennessee's Heath Shuler and Fresno State's Trent 
Dilfer, they sit perplexed, unsure if Dilfer will slip to fifth and motivated 
to retreat in Round 1 if he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland has caught the Rams' attention with an offer of the ninth position 
in Round 1 for the Rams' first-round pick. But the Browns are offering a draft 
pick rather than wide receiver Michael Jackson -- as requested by the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversations continued Saturday with the Rams offering Cowboy receiver Alvin 
Harper $4.8 million for the next three years and Harper holding out for $5.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams and Harper come to terms before the draft, a trade is already in 
place with Dallas. The Rams have agreed to give Dallas the fifth selection in 
Round 1 -- contingent on Dilfer being gone -- for Harper and one of the 
Cowboys' second-round choices (position 17). 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams keep hearing that they will have no shot at Dilfer. Tampa Bay 
reportedly is talking to New England for the opportunity to pick fourth and 
grab him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer will be there for the Rams if Washington fulfills expectations and 
takes Shuler and New England maintains its position at No. 4 and selects USC 
defensive end/linebacker Willie McGinest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tampa makes the deal," said John Becker, Ram director of player 
personnel. "But McGinest has become the hottest name in the draft, and he would 
fit right in at New England. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've been living in a cave if you haven't recognized that. He can play both 
defensive end and linebacker, and either way he's going to be rushing the 
passer, which excites a whole lot of teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ram officials believe Indianapolis will select Shuler instead of Faulk, 
leaving Dilfer for Washington and New England to take Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Trent goes either to Washington or Tampa," said Mike Sullivan, 
Dilfer's agent. "I understand New England has given Tampa indications that it 
might be willing to deal." 
</P>
<P>
 If Dilfer is gone and Harper won't sign, the Rams are leaning strongly to 
sliding back in Round 1 to acquire additional draft picks. In addition to the 
Browns' presentation, Phoenix has offered a second-round pick to move from No. 
10 to No. 5 and Minnesota has offered both of its first-round picks -- 
positions 18 and 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams do not want to move too far from the fifth selection, however. If 
they stay at five, they will look seriously at McGinest and Nebraska linebacker 
Trev Alberts. They have also talked about Notre Dame defensive tackle Bryant 
Young and Texas A&M defensive end Sam Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 If they accept the Browns' offer, a defensive lineman, such as Young, or a 
linebacker, such as Alberts or Alcorn State's John Thierry, will drop to the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 If they move to the 10th position, as Phoenix would like, they are concerned 
that they will have to choose between Texas A&M cornerback Aaron Glenn, who is 
fast but small, and Alabama cornerback Antonio Langham, who is slow but big. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams favor Glenn, but will also consider Georgia offensive tackle Bernard 
Williams and Auburn offensive tackle Wayne Gandy. The Rams give the edge to 
Williams over Gandy, but also continue to talk with Houston about offensive 
tackle Kevin Donnalley. The Rams have advised Houston that they would be 
willing to trade one of their second-round picks (position 49) for Donnalley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials have described the acquisition of Donnalley and Harper as "the 
perfect draft." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams do not get Harper, that leaves them desperate for a wide receiver. 
The Jets are expected to take Colorado wide receiver Charles Johnson with the 
13th selection in Round 1, the only receiver the Rams consider worthy of a No. 
1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have said what we're going to do: We will take a quarterback if he is 
there with the fifth pick," Coach Chuck Knox said. "But there is no secret 
about some of the needs we have. We would like to find a speed receiver, a left 
tackle, help at corner and along the defensive line, and a safety." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams don't need a quarterback because they gave Chris Miller $9 million 
for three years, but they will not pass on Dilfer or Shuler because of his 
long-range value to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams prefer Shuler because he is considered more athletic than Dilfer, but 
after grading all players available in this draft, they have ranked Dilfer No. 
3 behind Faulk and Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a productivity standpoint you'd have a very difficult time finding 
someone better than Dilfer," Becker said. "He's got the height and arm 
strength, runs the 40 in 4.73 seconds and for a big guy that's exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch him on videotape and he's moving well in the pocket, rarely taking 
sacks and the ball's coming out of there and on the mark. And from a character 
standpoint, you'd like this guy. He's almost brash, a guy that radiates 
confidence, and a guy who will stand out there all day throwing the ball 
because he loves the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said Dilfer is probably a better passer than Shuler, but he said he 
lacks the big-time athleticism that Shuler has. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shuler has excellent movement and fine leadership ability," Becker said. "And 
he's really fun to watch as he takes over a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said both Shuler and Dilfer have the chance to become franchise 
quarterbacks, but if given the choice of Shuler, Dilfer, and the top two 
quarterbacks in last year's draft (New England's Drew Bledsoe and Seattle's 
Rick Mirer), he would take Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time I see athleticism in a quarterback, I get fired up," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have a pair of picks in the second round, one each in rounds three 
and four, three choices in the sixth and no selections in rounds five and 
seven.

THESE DAYS, EVERY PICK MUST PAY OFF; PRO FOOTBALL: THE LIMITS OF THE SALARY CAP 
DICTATE THAT EVEN ROOKIES MUST CONTRIBUTE IMMEDIATELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Apologies to all you armchair scouts who have spent good money on hot tips, 
hotlines and hot sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important statistic in today's 59th annual NFL draft, which begins at 
12:30 p.m. PDT, is not height, weight or 40-yard time. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 According to league research, 92% of last year's draft picks spent the 1993 
season on either active rosters, practice squads or injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a 60% increase over the number of players who usually stick. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer are today's activities considered a cute little Sunday afternoon 
exercise in rolling the dice. 
</P>
<P>
 This has become serious business. Team-building, game-winning, Super Bowl-type 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under our new rules, you must do a better job drafting," said Carl Peterson, 
general manager of the Kansas City Chiefs. "With the salary cap and all that, 
you must find rookies who can come in and play right away. The draft becomes 
extremely important to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 That explains why, unlike in past years, the theme of this year's seven-round 
event is not offense, or defense, or quarterbacks or linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 It is trades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys, picking 28th in 29 first-round slots, want desperately to 
trade up for one of the top eight defensive players. But so do the San 
Francisco 49ers. And Chicago Bears. And New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 With free-agency defections and salary-cap problems, those teams need cheap 
help, and they need it now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indianapolis Colts, with two of the first seven picks in an average draft, 
would be willing to trade down. So would the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing that hasn't happened is somebody offering representatives 
of Charlotte or Jacksonville a slew of picks for a chance to take their place 
at today's coin flip determining the first pick in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But the day is still young. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team out there is working hard to make this an impact draft," said 
Bobby Beathard, San Diego Charger general manager who has one of three teams 
without a first-round pick. "It will be interesting to see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The only certainties are that Ohio State defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson will 
be the first player picked by somebody , and that defensive players will 
dominate the early selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are two dominant quarterbacks, as there were last year, 
Tennessee's Heath Shuler and Fresno State's Trent Dilfer are not being confused 
with Drew Bledsoe and Rick Mirer. 
</P>
<P>
 And although San Diego State running back Marshall Faulk will probably be the 
second player picked, he is considered the only franchise running back of the 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 This won't be like last year, when Jerome Bettis, Garrison Hearst and Robert 
Smith were taken in the first 21 slots. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the year of the glamour position, but of the player who gets 
dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the year of defensive linemen known for their ferocity -- Wilkinson, 
Notre Dame's Bryant Young, Texas A&M's Sam Adams, USC's Willie McGinest. 
</P>
<P>
 And gifted cornerbacks -- Texas A&M's Aaron Glenn, Alabama's Antonio Langham. 
</P>
<P>
 And linebackers who hit like Junior Seau -- Alcorn State's John Thierry, 
Nebraska's Trev Alberts, UCLA's Jamir Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 All mock drafts will have those players near the top. But with the great 
potential for trades, this is a year many mock drafts could become mockeries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cincinnati Bengals have the first overall pick, and have already 
started negotiating with Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't be surprised if they suddenly trade that pick to a defense-hungry 
team like the Arizona Cardinals or New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Patriots have the fourth overall pick, and are expected to select 
McGinest. But don't be surprised if they trade down with the Indianapolis 
Colts, who have the seventh pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts, expected to take Faulk with the second pick, could then take Dilfer 
with the Patriots' pick. 
</P>
<P>
 What looked like a foolish move -- the Colts passing on Shuler for Faulk 
simply because they have Jim Harbaugh -- could suddenly turn into the best move 
of many drafts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has to be what the Colts are thinking," a club official said. "They 
could end up with both of those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the Patriots don't trade their pick, the Rams are expected to pick 
Dilfer, figuring that a top quarterback prospect should not be ignored even if 
he would have to play behind Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Patriots trade their pick, then the Rams could trade their pick to 
the Cowboys, who want McGinest and would give up receiver Alvin Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 All that noise, in the first 75 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams will spend the rest of the first round jockeying to get into a position 
to take one of the seven remaining impact defenders. After that, offensive 
lineman and wide receivers will be taken, among them USC's Johnnie Morton, who 
would look good to the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 17th pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone will be affected by first-round maneuvering. The best move 
involving the Raiders has already happened. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Green Bay Packers signed former Tampa Bay running back Reggie Cobb on 
Thursday, it left Northern Illinois running back LeShon Johnson for Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Or would he choose bigger, quicker Arizona State running back Mario Bates? 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe he would forget about running back and find a much-needed linebacker, 
perhaps Aubrey Beavers of Oklahoma? 
</P>
<P>
 At least we know he will not take Florida State quarterback Charlie Ward. This 
year's Heisman Trophy winner is not expected to be selected until the second or 
third round. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new NFL, it is comforting to know that some things never change. Fearless 
Forecast 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Bill Plaschke gives his projection of how the first round 
of today' NFL draft will play out: 
</P>
<P>
 No. & Team: 1. CINCINNATI Player: Dan Wilkinson Pos.: DT College: Ohio State 
Why: Would you turn down the next Cortez Kennedy? 
</P>
<P>
 No. & Team: 2. INDIANAPOLIS Player: Marshall Faulk Pos.: RB College: San Diego 
State Why: If anybody can make quarterback Jim Harbaugh look good, it is this 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
 No. & Team: 3. WASHINGTON Player: Heath Shuler Pos.: QB College: Tennessee 
Why: Coach Norv Turner groomed Troy Aikman in Dallas and sees a similar prodigy 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 No. & Team: 4. NEW ENGLAND Player: Willie McGinest Pos.: DE College: USC Why: 
Only six teams had worse defenses against the rush, and only eight teams had 
fewer sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 No. & Team: 5. RAMS Player: Trent Dilfer Pos.: QB College: Fresno State Why: 
Hey, if Colts really think Harbaugh is the answer and are willing to let this 
talent fall here, Chuck Knox will be glad to snag him. 
</P>
<P>
 No. & Team: 6. TAMPA BAY Player: Aaron Glenn Pos.: CB College: Texas A&M Why: 
Defensive backfield was bad enough before Ricky Reynolds defected. 
</P>
<P>
 No. & Team: 7. INDIANAPOLIS (from Atlanta) Player: Bryant Young Pos.: DT 
College: Notre Dame Why: If they don't trade up for Dilfer or down to San 
Francisco or Minnesota, they can rebuild defensive line around this guy. 
</P>
<P>
 No. & Team: 8. SEATTLE Player: Sam Adams Pos.: DE College: Texas A&M Why: They 
really want Young, but they need somebody to keep opponents from triple-teaming 
Kennedy, even if it is a guy with reputation for not playing hard. 
</P>
<P>
 No. & Team: 9. CLEVELAND Player: John Thierry Pos.: LB College: Alcorn State 
Why: Dallas would like to trade up for this pick if Rams won't deal. Thierry 
plays as cold-blooded as Coach Bill Belichick acts. 
</P>

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; WITHOUT VISIBLE WEAKNESSES, SAMPRAS IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Sampras, home in Tampa preparing for the clay-court season after earning 
more than $1 million already this year, has made the most of his time at the 
top of the ATP Tour rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 He has maintained his No. 1 ranking for all but three weeks since April 12, 
1993. He has won the last three Grand Slam events -- Wimbledon, the U.S. Open 
and the Australian Open -- and his 33-2 start this year is the best on the ATP 
Tour since 1989, when Ivan Lendl won 36 of 38 matches before losing in the 
French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras increased his 1994 earnings to $1,125,038 when he won his sixth title 
of the year, defeating Michael Chang in the Japan Open final on April 10. And 
he will take a 21-match winning streak into next month's Italian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that he's really head and shoulders above everyone else," said 
John McEnroe, who twice spent more than a year at No. 1. "He's got the 
confidence factor, he's got people intimidated and he looks to be fitter than 
I've ever seen him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just in that flow right now, so unless someone is able to pick it up, or 
something happens to him on a physical level, it's pretty difficult to envision 
him losing the No. 1 ranking this year." 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe was dominant in 1984, winning 82 of 85 matches, but success came so 
easily, he said, that he grew complacent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time that I felt like I was a level above the (other) 
players," said McEnroe, whose U.S. Open championship in 1984 was the last of 
his seven Grand Slam event titles. "My mistake was, at the end of the year, I 
was resting on it a little bit, saying, 'I'm going to see what other people do 
(to catch up),' as opposed to working harder at that particular time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be interesting to see how Pete reacts at the end of this year or, 
depending on what happens, the remaining part of this year." 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe, though, said that Sampras has no glaring weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, to nit-pick about someone as good as that is absurd," McEnroe said. 
"He's a great player, there's no question about it. I'd love to have that serve 
for a couple weeks. And he has worked extremely hard. He obviously learns from 
his mistakes because he's been around for a while and now his time is here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side: While Sampras' star has skyrocketed, Jim Courier's has 
plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier spent more than two years at No. 1 or 2 before last November, but has 
twice fallen to No. 5 this year and is currently ranked fourth. He has won only 
one title in the last 11 months, none since August, and only two matches 
against top-10 opponents, both against Goran Ivanisevic. He lost eight of his 
last 15 matches in 1993 and has twice lost his opening match in tournaments 
this year. He has reached the final in only one of his last 14 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously lost his confidence, and I think his game is based a lot on 
his confidence," McEnroe said. "He's not as natural a player as Pete, for 
example, so he can't rely on his ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to rely more on his physical conditioning, and it all plays hand in 
hand with his mental frame of mind. He's probably been going so hard for the 
last couple years -- he trains so hard -- that he's probably a little bit 
burned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it looks right now that he's really struggling, he's still got time 
to pull it together, potentially, before the French Open." 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe suggested that Courier, a two-time French Open winner, might benefit 
from turning down the intensity a notch as he prepares for this year's 
tournament, which opens in Paris on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to honestly know what he needs to do without having seen him play a 
lot and not knowing what's in his head at this particular time," McEnroe said. 
"But some people, when things go wrong, they like to train harder. And it looks 
like he's doing even more of that, from what I understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would probably advocate taking it easy a little bit because he's certainly 
in shape. He's probably hurting himself at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he'll probably do exactly the opposite." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Back on track: Steffi Graf, who withdrew from last month's Family Circle 
Magazine Cup because of a minor knee injury, is expected to return to action 
this week in the Citizen Cup at Hamburg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The WTA Tour's No. 1 player is unbeaten in 28 matches and winner of five 
tournaments this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect to win everything, but I know I can do it," Graf said last 
month after winning the Lipton Championship at Key Biscayne, Fla. "That's 
what's important, to know you can." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Asian Ace: After winning the Salem Open at Hong Kong this month, Michael Chang 
is 41-5 in Asia during the last two years, 16-2 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of his 16 titles have been won in Asia, all since the start of 1993. 
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Austin, who was 17 when she passed the $1-million mark in earnings 
during the summer of 1980, still needs $17,991 to pass the $2-million mark. . . 
. It has been almost two years, a span of 33 tournaments, since Gabriela 
Sabatini won the Italian Open in 1992 for her last WTA Tour title. She has lost 
in five finals during that time. . . . Next Saturday is the one-year 
anniversary of the attack on Monica Seles. . . . Randy Snow, 10-time U.S. Open 
wheelchair tennis champion, will be among the instructors at a camp for players 
in wheelchairs Wednesday through next Sunday at the Vic Braden Tennis College 
in Coto de Caza. Details: (714) 361-6811.

REDINGTON VIEWS MINOR EMPLOYMENT AS MAJOR VICTORY; BASEBALL: STINT WITH LAKE 
ELSINORE PUTS FORMER TIMES ORANGE COUNTY PLAYER OF THE YEAR BACK IN 
PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Redington walked into the clubhouse at the Lake Elsinore Diamond for the 
first time, took a quick look around and knew he was home. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the locker stalls in the new stadium weren't finished yet. So there was 
no hot water in the showers. So his teammates thought he was old enough to be 
Crash Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 He was playing baseball for a living again. It's good work if you can get it. 
Redington had been away from the game long enough to remember that. 
</P>
<P>
 Redington once was a can't-miss prospect, The Times Orange County high school 
player of the year in 1987, who seemed destined for the major leagues. Everyone 
said so, and Redington was the firmest believer. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, hadn't he batted .366 with nine home runs and 30 runs batted in as 
a senior at Esperanza? Hadn't he homered in Dodger Stadium in the 1986 Southern 
Section 4-A championship game? Hadn't he hit .442 with 10 homers and 42 RBIs as 
a junior? 
</P>
<P>
 But that was long before struggling in the minors, before playing for three 
organizations in three seasons and before the Chicago White Sox released him 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He was out of baseball from March 31 to Nov. 18, when the Angels took a chance 
and signed him. The easiest thing in the world would have been to walk away 
when the White Sox cut him, but Redington didn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted another chance to prove he could still play. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has it, he's noticing the little things he used to take for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been playing baseball my whole life," said Redington, 25. "Last summer 
was the first time since I don't know when that I didn't play. Usually, you 
hate the bus rides. Come August you're ready to go home. You're saying, 'Let's 
get the season over with.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'll ever feel that way again. I guess you never know how much 
you miss something. Even though we're losing, and we have long bus rides and 
there's all the stuff you don't enjoy, the basic thing is the life is a lot of 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Elsinore, the Angels' new Class-A affiliate, isn't far from Anaheim 
Stadium and the majors, but make no mistake it's still the bush leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Storm has won only two of 16 games and is in last place in the California 
League's Southern Division. Most of the players are young, with only a season 
or two of pro experience. And then there's the unfinished stadium, beautiful 
only if you don't look too closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't shower the first few home games," Redington said. "(Without 
lockers) we had to take our stuff home every night or it would get stolen. Guys 
had shirts and hats stolen. It was the first time I'd experienced that. There 
was a rude awakening." 
</P>
<P>
 Redington laughed. He wouldn't trade this for anything, except perhaps a 
ticket to double-A Midland. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes he'll be promoted soon, but for now he's content merely to be playing 
again. That he's playing well is an added bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty good, actually," said Redington, batting .298 with a .389 
on-base percentage and four RBIs in 13 games as a first and third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're working with me. As long as somebody's trying to help you, that's a 
good sign. I still feel the effects of being out a whole season. I'm hitting 
the ball well right now, but not close to where I want to be. It'll kick in 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Forsch, the Angels' director of minor league operations, acknowledged the 
odds are against Redington ever making the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we didn't want to rush him," said Forsch, a former pitcher who won 
114 games in 16 major league seasons, including five with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see how he does. He's got the desire and willingness to work. It's a 
question of getting out there and competing and things falling into place for 
him. The goal is to keep moving up (in the organization) until you peak out." 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox apparently believed Redington had hit the end of the line last 
spring. They released him after only one full season, when he batted .231 in 88 
games at double-A Birmingham in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he batted .284 at Wichita, the San Diego Padres' double-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent four seasons before joining the Padre organization bouncing between 
the Atlanta Braves' Class-A and double-A affiliates. His most productive season 
for the Braves was in 1989, when he hit .299 with 17 homers and 52 RBIs in 85 
games at Class-A Burlington. 
</P>
<P>
 His release last March came as a shock. He thought he would be signed by 
another team, but when he wasn't he returned to familiar turf. 
</P>
<P>
 While working out at Esperanza, where he had his greatest success, Redington 
impressed Aztec Coach Mike Curran all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never did get a job or do anything that made you think he was out of 
baseball," Curran said. "He always seemed like he was just waiting for the 
chance to get back at it." 
</P>
<P>
 That was nothing new. According to Curran, Redington always was a confident 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy worked hard," Curran said. "He was a natural bulldog. He'd get it done 
or talk the team into getting it done. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could handle pressure. If he struck out, he wouldn't pout and moan and 
bring the rest of the team down. I heard people saying in the minors that he 
wasn't a team player. I couldn't imagine that." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Braves made Redington their third-round pick in the 1987 free-agent 
draft, the world seemed to be his for the taking. He could have gone to Arizona 
to play college ball and perhaps later taken a crack at a spot on the 1988 U.S. 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wanted to play professionally and couldn't wait. The reported $100,000 
signing bonus and incentive package the Braves offered only sweetened the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Redington believes things happened too fast. By the time he was 
20, he'd been to the big club's spring training camp and was projected as the 
club's next third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of that stuff is hard to handle at 20," he said. "I was still just a 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he's 25, the odds are against him, and his teammates think he's been 
hanging around forever like the character Kevin Costner played in "Bull 
Durham." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's Rich Amaral, who at 31 was the oldest rookie in the majors last 
season, is now a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like that old saying, 'As long as you have that uniform on, you have a 
chance to play in the big leagues,' " Redington said. "I'll always have that 
chance as long as I'm playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no pressure. I'm just trying to have fun."

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; OLAJUWON, KARL GET PRESTIGIOUS VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I hate awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Any issue that has to be settled by a poll of sportswriters is a small one, 
indeed. On the other hand, I need an easy column as much as the next man. 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain my usual high moral tone, I'll disagree with the consensus as 
often as possible. MVP 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anything more boring than debating the relative merits of Hakeem 
Olajuwon, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal and Scottie Pippen? 
</P>
<P>
 These are four great players who are thisclose. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was No. 2 in scoring, No. 3 in blocks, was the only center among the 
steals leaders and led his team in assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaq went No. 1-1-2-6 in scoring, shooting percentage, rebounding and blocks, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen is in the top 10 in scoring and steals, the top 30 in rebounds and just 
missed the top 30 in assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner is Olajuwon, who had two monster seasons in a row, leading his team 
to two division titles. COACH OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to pass up Atlanta's Lenny Wilkens, who pulled off a minor miracle, 
but we'll ignore the usual criterion -- who pulled the most unexpected 
turnaround? -- to vote for George Karl, who performed a larger miracle over 
three seasons, taking the Seattle SuperSonics, who had gone 99-101 in their 
previous 200 games, to 140-60 in their next 200. DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
 The award usually goes to the leader in shots blocked and Dikembe Mutombo has 
promised to go home mad if he doesn't win. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Rodman doesn't play defense the way he did before he discovered 
rebounds. Even if true, it wouldn't disqualify him because he used to be, pound 
for pound, the greatest defender who ever lived and remains great. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Rockets, they had him -- at 6-8, 210, an average-size small 
forward -- guarding Olajuwon and doing a nice job of it. Throw in Worm's 11 
defensive rebounds a night, two more than the next-best player, and it's an 
easy choice. I'd rather watch Rodman play without the ball than 99% of the 
players in the game with it. MOST IMPROVED PLAYER 
</P>
<P>
 Don MacLean, who was tougher than his child-of-the-suburbs game suggested and 
will be an NBA starter for years. SIXTH MAN 
</P>
<P>
 Deadeye Del Curry, a charter Charlotte Hornet who averaged 16 points in 27 
minutes. ROOKIE OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 Anfernee Hardaway, the point guard of the '90s (pre-Jason Kidd, anyway), nips 
Chris Webber, the power forward of the '90s who should get more than nine 
rebounds a game. YOUR FINALISTS: NOT SO SWEET 16 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it wasn't a great regular season but these guys made the playoffs, in 
whatever condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the (snicker) East: 
</P>
<P>
 ATLANTA HAWKS -- They kept it going after trading Dominique Wilkins for Danny 
Manning, who tiptoed around his new teammates, averaging 16 points as a Hawk, 
eight fewer than he had as a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkens cut their defensive average 11 points from the 108 they gave up last 
season under Bob Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW YORK KNICKS -- They won 15 in a row, then folded down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 After an embarrassing loss to the Alonzo Mourning-less Charlotte Hornets, 
Coach Pat Riley said his players hadn't stepped up and he, himself, had "failed 
miserably" and needed to "go home, turn the lights off and think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knick press corps, used to his mind games, decided it was less a heartfelt 
admission than a ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times' George Vecsey consulted Riley's latest book, "The Winner 
Within, and found a chapter called "The Temporary Insanity Textbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Riley: "A leader's aggrieved outburst is not an explosion nor is it a 
regular or predictable event. It is the art of being angry at the right time, 
to the right degree, with the right people. T.I. requires plenty of advanced 
thought -- a real, focused mental plan, not emotion-driven monologue. A dose of 
T.I. demands a rapid follow-up of compassion." 
</P>
<P>
 If ploy it was, it failed miserably. The Knicks lost a key game to the Atlanta 
Hawks two nights later, blowing a nine-point fourth-quarter lead at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Riley suspended Anthony Mason for complaining about playing time. This 
could cost Mason $30,000 if the players' association sits still for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason can expect his "rapid follow-up of compassion" in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO BULLS -- Until Friday when they gagged in double overtime against the 
Celtics, they had a chance to win the East and tie last season's record when 
they still had Michael Jordan. Call it one game short of a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 ORLANDO MAGIC -- While building for the future, picking up three No. 1 picks 
plus Hardaway, the Magic jumped from 41 victories to 49 with a chance at 50 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Grant says he'll take less money to sign, which would make Orlando the 
favorite for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 INDIANA PACERS -- In four seasons before Larry Brown, they ran the gamut of 
mediocrity, from fair (42-40) to OK (41-41 twice) to disappointing (40-42). 
</P>
<P>
 He taught them a strange new art, defense, and they posted their best record 
since entering the NBA in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 CLEVELAND CAVALIERS -- If someone had told you Brad Daugherty would miss 32 
games and Larry Nance would miss 49, you wouldn't have thought they'd do as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone had told Mike Fratello, he wouldn't have taken the coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW JERSEY NETS -- Chuck Daly, longest-suffering coach in hoops with the scars 
to prove it, has more after surviving a 6-13 start and creating some chemistry 
on a team that lost Drazen Petrovic but retained Derrick Coleman, Benoit 
Benjamin and Chris Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 MIAMI HEAT -- It hit the franchise high point at 38-28 but went 4-12 down the 
stretch. Coach Kevin Loughery is a goner unless the Heat wins a playoff series 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the West: 
</P>
<P>
 SEATTLE SUPERSONICS -- With their pressure defense and fast-paced offense, 
they posted the league's best point differential, 9.2 a game. The No. 2 Knicks, 
at 6.1, were 33% behind. 
</P>
<P>
 HOUSTON ROCKETS -- They play great defense and smarter offense but still set 
an NBA record for three-point shots and makes. When the treys don't drop, 
they're beatable. 
</P>
<P>
 PHOENIX SUNS -- Like a grizzly waking from a season's hibernation, Charles 
Barkley is growling about the unprintables in the press who remarked on their 
drop from 62 victories. Kevin Johnson averaged 20 points and nine assists. 
Nobody else has two unstoppable players, so watch out. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN ANTONIO SPURS -- They streaked to 40-16 but then flattened out when the 
Admiral ran out of scoring help. 
</P>
<P>
 UTAH JAZZ -- Karl Malone said he wanted out. They won 10 in a row, then went 
8-10. They're still a night's work but not what they were when Mark Eaton 
filled the lane. 
</P>
<P>
 GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS -- They closed fast, going 9-2 and averaging 114 points 
with Don Nelson's newest toy, the "point spree" lineup with Latrell Sprewell, 
Webber, Chris Mullin and Billy Owens sharing point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS -- In three seasons, their victory totals had gone 
63-59-51. This season they'll miss 50. 
</P>
<P>
 DENVER NUGGETS -- They're coming but need a star. Rodney Rogers can be the 
next Barkley if he plays hard two games out of three, but so far it looks like 
one in three. FAREWELL TO A GREAT LAKER 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are considering buying out the last two years of James Worthy's 
contract, so today's game could be his last. 
</P>
<P>
 He was more than a fine player. In the early '80s, Jamaal Wilkes was the 
nicest Laker. In the late '80s, it was Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is farewell, it's a shame he has to go out on bad wheels with a team 
of children, but nothing can dim the memories of what he did and who he was. 
FAREWELL TO A GREAT CLIPPER? 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins, upset at the pace of negotiations, said last week he didn't 
think he'd return. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants $21 million for three years. The Clippers offered two at $6 million 
and a third at the club's option -- a guaranteed $12 million -- putting them a 
mere $9 million apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins has little leverage unless another bidder steps up unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers have their own problems. 
</P>
<P>
 They have to prove they can keep someone so even a holdout would be 
embarrassing. They knew his asking price. He has been warmly received and 
promises to be the spokesman they never had. 
</P>
<P>
 Why a team going nowhere chose a 34-year-old is another question. He remains a 
marvel, still bounding around the lot, basketball's version of Nolan Ryan 
throwing 90 m.p.h. in his 40s 
</P>
<P>
 So guarantee him $16.5 million and let's get on with it. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Still Gonzo after all these years: No one indulges their young like the 
Hornets, but there was no covering for Mourning, who eighty-sixed their playoff 
drive, picking a fight with the Bulls' Luc Longley and getting himself thrown 
out of a game the Hornets lost. "How stupid is that?" a teammate told the 
Gaston, N.C., Gazette. "(Mourning) has to prove he's a he-man." Said club 
President Spencer Stolpen after Mourning refused to answer questions, "There's 
no question what Alonzo did was childish. I'd love for him to talk about it. 
I'd love for him to tell Charlotte how he feels. It's just not his personality. 
But when your teammates remind you about it, management reminds you about it 
and you see it all over the papers, then you probably don't want to talk about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Parish, probably playing in his last home game as a Celtic, got a 
two-minute standing ovation Thursday. There is speculation he'll come back next 
season as a Warrior. . . . Philadelphia owner Harold Katz hired body builder 
Lee Haney to bulk up Shawn Bradley, who dipped 25 pounds to 220 in half a 
season. "We can't live with (Bradley)," Katz said. "I'm hopeful with Lee, there 
will be no more excuses." Unimpressed, Bradley replied that he's summering in 
Utah.

JAMES IS WORTHY BUT NOT LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: MAGIC TO START EX-ALL-STAR IN 
TODAY'S FINAL AFTER 126-91 LOSS, THE NINTH IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tribute might be premature, but Coach Magic Johnson isn't taking any 
chances. He doesn't want to risk James Worthy spending much of the last game of 
his career on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Worthy figures to be in the starting lineup today for only 
the second time this season as the Lakers finish against the Utah Jazz at the 
Forum. Johnson wants it that way. He wants a dignified player to have a 
dignified moment, should this be the end of an illustrious career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be," Johnson said. "I'm going to start him and Kurt Rambis and James 
Edwards in anticipation that it's going to be. I'm not saying it is, but just 
in case it is, I want them to go out with something special." 
</P>
<P>
 The ending to the season won't take care of that, not on a team that Saturday 
afternoon set a franchise record by losing its ninth consecutive game, 126-91, 
to Golden State at Oakland Coliseum Arena and continues to frustrate the coach 
and most veterans. Not on a team that suffered its worst defeat since Jan. 21, 
1992, and was swept in the season series by the Warriors for the first time 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy, who has two years left on his contract, has not said he will retire 
after this season. But given the opportunity to refute speculation that he 
would prefer a buyout, he has not said he will be back. The stance for months 
has been that it doesn't warrant serious consideration at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Saturday if he has any special feelings because today's game might be 
his last, Worthy stayed that course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last game of the regular season, with no playoffs," he said. "I 
think about that a lot. But I'm not thinking about my personal situation too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers should welcome any possible distractions. Ensured of back-to-back 
losing seasons for the first time since the mid-1970s, they are also guaranteed 
to finish with the second-worst record in the Los Angeles era, no matter what 
happens today. Their defense continues to get shredded -- 10 consecutive 
opponents have reached triple figures for the first time since 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like watching a clinic," Johnson said of Saturday's showing, which 
included the Warriors scoring 73 points by intermission, the most points the 
Lakers have given up in a half all season. "It was bad on our side. Missed 
layups. Kicking the ball. A lot of missed assignments. But as I said in 
Phoenix, one team is in the playoffs and one team is on vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 Is he upset? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm already past that," Johnson said. "It's too late to be upset. I'm 
frustrated, I'm embarrassed, and I told them at halftime that I am embarrassed 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Smith led the Lakers with 19 points. Chris Webber had 27 points and 12 
rebounds for the Warriors, both game highs. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 NBC reported Saturday that the Lakers have offered Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino 
a five-year, $21-million contract to succeed Magic Johnson. The Lakers would 
neither confirm nor deny. . . . . Johnson said he considered activating himself 
for the final two games before deciding to stay retired. "I was thinking about 
it," he said. "Both of these -- this one and Utah." . . . Tony Smith will be 
honored Friday by the Los Angeles City Council for his post-earthquake 
community work. The Laker guard will also receive a certificate of appreciation 
on Wednesday from the Santa Monica chapter of the American Red Cross for 
similar contributions.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; WHY SO MUCH OFFENSE? FOR STARTERS, IT'S PITCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Angel Manager Buck Rodgers noted the other day, it's difficult to tell 
which is livelier -- the balls, bats or imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Theories abound on the largest offensive onslaught in April history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the latest Haitian revolution left the balls stored there so long they 
simply dried out," announcer-comic Bob Uecker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem with that is that the balls are now manufactured in Costa Rica, and 
Rawlings says they are manufactured to the same specifications as always. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcaster Tim McCarver said he takes Rawlings at its word. Pitching, he 
said, is the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every rule change has been designed to protect the hitter and produce more 
offense," he said. "Now you have those rule changes catching up with pitching 
that's mediocre at best. I mean, middle relief is deplorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing new about this. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely come up before, but the magnitude of this year's production 
is staggering," said Steve Hirdt of the Elias News Bureau, the major leagues' 
statistical house. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, if it occurred in August it might have been overlooked. But 
in the first two or three weeks of April, it definitely stands out." 
</P>
<P>
 Uecker agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the time of year when the pitchers are supposed to be ahead of the 
hitters," he said. "If this is an example, maybe the pitchers should start 
reporting right after Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen of the 28 teams have already scored 10 or more runs in a game. Three 
players -- Cory Snyder, Tim Raines and Karl Rhodes -- have already hit three 
home runs in a game. The Atlanta Braves have twice hit three consecutive 
homers. The Boston Red Sox scored 22 runs, the Dodgers 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's still April," McCarver said. "I mean, wait until the weather warms 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Elias, there is an average of 10.4 runs per game, up 16% from 
last year, and 2.3 homers, compared to 1.6 in '93. At the current pace, there 
will be more than 10,000 homers hit, shattering the record of 4,458 during the 
allegedly juiced-ball season of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also noteworthy that the major league earned-run average is a soaring 
4.66 compared to 4.12 at this time last year, and most believe that increase 
reflects diluted pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tough part is that I don't see it getting any better," Philadelphia 
Phillie General Manager Lee Thomas said. "There just isn't any pitching out 
there, particularly kids who can throw hard." 
</P>
<P>
 There were 233 pitchers used in 1960, the last year of the eight team leagues. 
There were 533 used in 1993, when each league had 14 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the current 28 teams carried 11 or more pitchers into this season, 
hoping to equate quantity with quality while preparing for frequent calls to 
the bullpen. Only the Atlanta Braves have a five-man rotation that prompts 
heads to turn, and the dearth of middle-relief pitching has been accompanied by 
a significant decrease in the number of proven closers. 
</P>
<P>
 If pitching has been unable to keep pace with expansion, it has also wilted 
under changes designed to favor the offense: lowering of the mound in 1969, 
introduction of the designated hitter in 1973, the proliferation of artificial 
turf and a return to cozier ballparks with shorter dimensions and less foul 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitchers also are handicapped by the refusal of umpires to call the high 
strike as specified in the rules and by their own reluctance to pitch inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The style of pitching has also evolved from power to finesse, probably because 
of Little League, high school and college coaches who place more emphasis on 
winning than development. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got kids throwing split-fingers and breaking pitches before their arms 
are ready for it, and when they have to reach back for a fastball, it's not 
there," McCarver said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember talking to (New York Met executive) Gerry Hunsicker last year and 
he said that only two or three of the top prospects in the country threw more 
than 90 (m.p.h.)." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that force-fed young pitchers are trying to pitch a finesse game 
in the major leagues before they have the ability to handle it. That often 
leaves them behind in the count against beefed-up hitters who no longer care 
how many times they strike out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true," Uecker said. "You've got weightlifters swinging thin-handled 
bats as if they're a riding crop. I've never seen so many bats break. If they 
really wanted to even it out, they'd make the hitter use what's left." THE WAY 
IT IS 
</P>
<P>
 With David Wells on the disabled list, the Detroit Tigers recalled 21-year-old 
Jose Lima, their youngest pitcher since 1980 and a guy with a 17-36 minor 
league record. 
</P>
<P>
 Lima gave up consecutive homers to Kansas City's Gary Gaetti and Dave 
Henderson in an ugly first appearance, but Manager Sparky Anderson says he will 
get another. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows if he can pitch yet, but in the big leagues today there are 280 
pitchers," Anderson said. "We might have a question about half of them, a third 
at least. He's at least in the unknown category. Some of those others are known 
(to be bad)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, of course, are without alternatives, as they were, Anderson 
suggested, when they re-signed the erratic Wells to a three-year, $7.5-million 
contract even though he had spent August on the disabled list because of the 
elbow injury that has put him back on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Anderson of a staff that had to be supplemented wherever and however it 
could: "Hey, I didn't see us waltzing around with any Cy Young winners." BECK'S 
VIEW 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Beck, the San Francisco Giant closer who has been sidelined since April 5 
because of a broken bone in his left foot, was eligible to be taken off the 
disabled list Thursday but might not be ready, at least in management's 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays on Wednesday showed little improvement, and there is a possibility that 
calcium has developed around the instep. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to rush him," General Manager Bob Quinn said. "We're not 
going to risk losing him for two or three months." 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-nosed Beck said he is ready now. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't even ask me anymore," he said. "They twist on my foot until it 
hurts, and then they say I can't pitch. I can deal with it. I can pitch with 
it. They just can't realize it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants have gotten three saves from setup man Mike Jackson, but Manager 
Dusty Baker said, "This is the toughest stretch since I've been managing. I try 
to push the right buttons without Rod, but it's not easy. My setup man is now 
my closer, and everyone else is acting as my setup man." HOLY COW 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Cubs are 0-8 at Wrigley Field, tying their worst home start. 
Worse, starting pitchers Jose Guzman and Mike Morgan have missed turns and 
might face the disabled list. Morgan, the former Dodger who was 10-15 last year 
after going 16-8 in his first season with the Cubs, is nursing shoulder, back 
and knee problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried throwing last year to keep on track, and all it did was hurt my back 
all the more," he said. "I'll be moving in with the trainers the rest of this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 These are definitely hard times for the Cubs. General Manager Larry Himes has 
eliminated the free clubhouse food, saying it cost $40,000 the last two years. 
Players will now have to pay for the burgers and pasta being brought in from 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before they were being treated better than everyone else," Himes said. "Now 
they're being treated equal. My secretary pays for her lunch. I pay for mine. 
They should pay for theirs." SAY WHAT? 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies apparently heard what they wanted to hear when Atlanta pitcher 
John Smoltz said of his Braves: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a team that had to come back from 10 games back to win (the title in 
the National League West last year). It's scary to think that if we put 
together a big margin, nobody will have a chance to catch us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies, who beat the Braves in the playoffs and are now a division rival 
in the realigned East Division, interpreted that as Smoltz saying no team could 
catch the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things are going good for you, that's when you keep your mouths shut and 
play," Philadelphia outfielder Milt Thompson said. "All they've done is put 
more pressure on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, we don't have to catch them. We just have to have one of the best 
records (as a wild-card team). 
</P>
<P>
 "And they know we know how to play in a playoff situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Smoltz, attempting clarification: "I never said the race was over. I 
never said nobody had a chance to catch us. It was taken out of context. The 
Phillies don't need any motivation." 
</P>
<P>
 * NO RELIEF: The Seattle Mariners' suspect bullpen is living up (down?) to 
billing. The Mariners are the only big league team without a save. Bobby Ayala 
has blown two, Kevin King one. Manager Lou Piniella was so angered by Ayala's 
failure to hold a 4-2 lead in the eighth inning of a 7-4 loss to the New York 
Yankees on Wednesday night that he ripped the cords from a dugout phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff opened the season with 520 saves, but 510 belonged to 
past-their-prime Goose Gossage and Bobby Thigpen. Management has indicated it 
will trade for a closer if the team is in the race in midseason, but that might 
be too late, assuming someone is available. 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD MARINERS: Third baseman Edgar Martinez, since winning the 1992 American 
League batting title and undergoing shoulder surgery on Sept. 12 of that year, 
has appeared in only 42 of 197 games. The hard-luck Martinez, plagued by a 
hamstring pull most of last year, was put back on the disabled list the other 
day, still encumbered by a bruised wrist suffered in his first at-bat of the 
season when hit by a pitch thrown by Dennis Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 * TEWK'S THEME: Bob Tewksbury of the St. Louis Cardinals started 0-3 last 
season and finished with 17 victories. Now he is 4-0, but his philosophy is the 
same. "Everybody was hootin' on me with that 0-3 start last year," he said. 
"The only thing I said was, 'Look at the record in October.' And that's all I'm 
saying now, 'Look at it in October.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * AT RISK: The dizziness and chest pains that put San Francisco Giant hitting 
coach Bobby Bonds into an Atlanta hospital the other night were caused by a 
spasm in a coronary artery. He was told to quit smoking and said he did so the 
moment he got into the ambulance. "The doctor said I've got to be intelligent 
enough to listen to him or dumb enough to take a gamble," Bonds said. "I'm not 
going to gamble." 
</P>
<P>
 * SIGH YOUNG: Jack McDowell, 5-0 last April, is now 1-2 with a 5.74 earned-run 
average and is 3-7 with a 5.05 ERA in his last 10 decisions, including the 
October playoff games with Toronto. Said Chicago White Sox Manager Gene Lamont: 
"His control isn't where it should be. The pitches he has been getting hurt on 
are definitely bad pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 * JUICE FACTORY: No pitching staff is contributing more to the April offensive 
onslaught than that of the Minnesota Twins, who have only one pitcher, 
left-handed reliever Larry Casian, a starter while at Cal State Fullerton, with 
an ERA under 6.00. Some numbers: Opponents were hitting .348 against the Twins 
through Thursday and had hit 31 homers, in the Metrodome. Twelve players have 
hit their first home runs of the season against Minnesota pitchers and Mark 
McGwire has hit four. In seven games against McGwire's Oakland Athletics, the 
Twins have given up 98 hits, 17 home runs and 21 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 * FINAL WORD: On his role in last Sunday's bench-clearing melee ignited when 
Benito Santiago of the Florida Marlins charged pitcher Kevin Rogers of the 
Giants, Charlie Hough, 46, said, "I ran out there at full speed, but by the 
time I got there the fight was over."

 The national anthem was already being sung when Manager Tom Lasorda arrived on 
the field before Friday night's game. Lasorda stepped onto the field, took his 
place in line and couldn't believe what was standing next to him.  
</P>
<P>
 Roger McDowell, along with a couple of other players, had someone make a 
life-size, cardboard cutout of Lasorda and had set it up on the field in line 
with the other players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lately I have been a little late getting out there, I've been on the phone or 
something," Lasorda said. "So I get out there last night, and I get in line and 
I look next to me, and I couldn't believe it. It looks just like me. It even 
had my hand over my heart."

 Chan Ho Park pitched four scoreless innings Friday night in his first start 
for double-A San Antonio against El Paso. Park gave up two hits, struck out 
seven and and walked none. . . . Darren Dreifort has an 0.73 earned-run average

six of the first seven batters he has faced entering games.

 Rodney Henderson lasted only two innings, but the fact that he was on the 
mound at all Saturday night is pretty amazing. In his first season with the 
Expos at their single-A club in 1992, he and four other members of the team 
were involved in a serious auto accident, when the car they were in swerved off 
the road. Two of his teammates never made it back to the game. Henderson 
suffered two broken vertebrae and a broken right wrist, and he not only made it 
back, but had a combined record of 17-7 in 1992, pitching both in single and 
double A. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson is in his third year in professional baseball and was called up from 
the Expos' double-A club a week ago when John Wetteland went on the disabled 
list. MARYANN HUDSON

 Manager Buck Rodgers saw catcher Greg Myers lying in a heap at home plate, and 
the first thought to come to mind was designated hitter Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who last caught a game 14 years ago, had been the Angels' emergency 
catcher the last three games. Chris Turner, the only other catcher on the 
roster, was in Kentucky attending the funeral of his 11-year-old nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing I said was, 'Is Turner back?' " Rodgers yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner had actually arrived in the seventh inning of Friday night's game, but 
instead of being on the bench Saturday, he was helping out in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers quickly relaxed when he was notified of Turner's presence, but 
according to Rodgers, someone else sure got the shakes.

 "The guy who really got nervous was Chili Davis," Rodgers said. "He came down 
(the bench) sweating."

 Reliever Ken Patterson, who pitched all of last season for the Angels before 
leaving for Cincinnati as a free agent, rejoins the club today to replace Mike 
Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released March 27 by the Cincinnati Reds despite having a guaranteed 
$400,000 contract. He signed a minor league contract with Vancouver and is 
being summoned despite a 9.53 ERA in three games. Rodgers said he simply 
preferred having another left-hander in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, who will be optioned to Vancouver, had a 16.62 ERA in six games this 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 "Butcher knew he needed help," Rodgers said. "I don't expect this to be a long 
drawn-out affair, but we need to get his head straight." 
</P>

<P>
 There was a moment of silence for former President Richard Nixon before 
Saturday's game, enabling the Angel organization to remember their times with 
Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire team was invited to Nixon's San Clemente home after the 1979 
season, former general manager Mike Port remembered Saturday. And Rodgers was 
Nixon's guest during a banquet in 1992 at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba 
Linda. Rodgers was even introduced to the audience by Nixon. 
</P>

 Left fielder Dwight Smith, playing his first game at Fenway Park, spent the 
afternoon wishing they would tear the place down. Smith misplayed three balls 
in the outfield and was charged with one error. "The ghosts of Fenway got him 
today," Rodgers said. "It's not unusual for guys to play poorly in Fenway their 
first time." . . . Angel reliever Joe Grahe, who had been suffering from a 
slightly pulled muscle in his left side, pitched for the first time in six 
days. He pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning. BOB NIGHTENGALE

SOCCER; U.S. WILL PLAY ICELAND TODAY

<P>
 The U.S. national team continues its preparation for this summer's World Cup 
soccer tournament when it plays Iceland at 3 p.m. today at Southwestern College 
in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 The match marks the third meeting between the teams in little more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 17 last year, the United States tied Iceland, 1-1, at Orange Coast 
College in Costa Mesa in a game during which American defender Marcelo Balboa 
suffered torn ligaments in his right knee. The injury sidelined Balboa for 
seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 31, the United States defeated Iceland, 1-0, at Reykjavik on a goal by 
Netherlands-based striker Ernie Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this week, the U.S. squad will travel to New Mexico for a game against 
Chile at Albuquerque on Saturday. GRAHAME JONES

TANNER FALLS IN SEMIFINAL TO FORMER NEWBURY PARK HIGH PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Roscoe Tanner signed up to play the 95th Ojai Valley tennis tournament, 
engravers might have prematurely etched his name on the men's open championship 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Tanner, a resident of Westlake Village, has won a grand slam event. 
He beat Guillermo Vilas to win the 1977 Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai doesn't often attract players of that stature anymore. But former 
Thousand Oaks resident Sean Brawley wasn't fazed. He beat Tanner 7-6 (7-5), 
6-4, in the semifinal round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous," said Brawley, 33, who attended Newbury Park High and 
Villanova Prep in Ojai before playing at USC and for a short time on the pro 
tour. "But I saw him play (Friday) and I saw that I needed to mix up the pace 
-- not serve and volley. He's a good counter-puncher." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner, 42, drew a large crowd, mainly because his presence at Libbey Park was 
something rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a star like this in my 10 years," said Gerry Roe, tournament 
publicity director. "(Grand Slam) winners used to come back regularly. But that 
stopped when the pro tour started paying big money." 
</P>
<P>
 The last was Alex Olmedo, who beat Rod Laver, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4, for the 1959 
Wimbledon championship and won the Ojai open title in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner, 42, beat Vilas, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in 1977. He came out of retirement last 
year for three seniors tournaments. Tanner looked exhausted in the second set 
and offered a number of self-deprecating quips such as "How about that for a 
90-year-old, eh?" and "I hit the ball and it goes like a bleeping rock." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was weary mentally, not physically," Tanner said. "I wasn't tired at all. 
I'm in good shape. Everybody was thinking there was pressure on me to play 
here. I don't think so. These guys are tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just out here struggling to keep even with them. But I think I'm giving 
them a good run." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner had two break-point opportunities in the second set but Brawley held to 
make it 3-3. Brawley then broke Tanner to lead, 5-4, when Tanner put a forehand 
return into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd, which never gave up on Tanner, erupted when he hit a backhand 
passer to make it 30-30 in the final game. But when Tanner hit long on his next 
service return to sink to 30-40, you could hear a pin drop. Brawley closed it 
out with a backhand cross. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' 18-and-under singles, Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks beat Krissy 
Hamilton of Agoura Hills, 6-4, 6-4, to repeat as champion. Hamilton, No. 1 last 
year by the Southern California Tennis Assn., is 1-3 against Bleszynski. . . . 
In the girls' 16 singles final, Sophia Managadze of Glendale beat Kirsten Gross 
of Calabasas, 6-2, 6-3. . . . Mike and Bob Bryan of Camarillo won their second 
consecutive boys' 16 doubles championship, defeating Rooshi Panchal and Sanjay 
Roy of Diamond Bar, 6-0, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Dylan Mann of Canoga Park fell to Joseph Gilbert of Fullerton, 7-5, 6-2, in 
the boys' 16 singles final. Erin Carroll of Ventura lost to Jess Melton of Los 
Angeles, 6-1, 6-4, in a boys' 14 semifinal. . . . Paul Gross and Jeremy 
Testwuide of Chaminade lost the boys' interscholastic doubles final to Ian 
Carrera and Jimmy Walker of Santa Barbara, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2).

SANTA ANITA; DELAHOUSSAYE WILL TAKE OVER ON STRODES CREEK IN KENTUCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corey Black is off and Eddie Delahoussaye is on Strodes Creek in the Kentucky 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 A switch that has been rumored ever since the Halo colt finished third in the 
Santa Anita Derby has finally been made official. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the decision was made by Arthur Hancock, one of Strodes Creek's 
owners along with trainer Charlie Whittingham and the Rose Hill Stable. 
Delahoussaye won the 1982 Derby with Gato Del Sol, who was also owned by 
Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to Charlie (Friday morning) when I called him back in Kentucky," 
said Nick Cosato, Black's agent. "That's when I found out about it. There had 
been talk. That's how it is on the backside. Of course, we were hoping the 
rumors weren't true." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Black in all four of his races, Strodes Creek has two victories and 
a second in addition to the third-place finish behind Brocco and Tabasco Cat in 
the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 In another Kentucky Derby development, Chris McCarron has gained the mount on 
Go For Gin for trainer Nick Zito. Jerry Bailey, who rode the colt to a 
second-place finish in the Wood Memorial, will ride the winner of that race, 
Irgun, at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens doesn't care where or when Rapan Boy makes his next start. All 
the jockey knows is that he wants to be riding him. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his American debut after racing in Australia and Hong Kong, the 
6-year-old gelding rallied from last to beat 23-1 shot The Berkeley Man by a 
head in the $108,100 San Simeon Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told my agent (Ron Anderson) not to take me off of him no matter where 
he runs," Stevens said. "I don't care if it's a mile and an eighth or what. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I knew about this horse was that he had been running in great 
company in Hong Kong and that he had been working like a real good horse at 
Hollywood Park, so I decided to ride him with a lot of confidence. This horse 
is for real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, he didn't handle this turf course at all. He was climbing all the way 
from the sand hitting him. He's just a classy individual." 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-2 third choice in the field of seven, Rapan Boy had earned $263,240 
while winning seven of 20 in his homeland and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse got to bleeding in Hong Kong, and they rule them off when they do 
that over there," trainer Gary Jones said. "He got way back (early in the San 
Simeon), but Gary said he was stumbling and falling down. He couldn't get a 
hold of the course at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Harmony, the 2-1 favorite, finished fifth without an excuse. Prince 
Ferdinand, who probably should have been disqualified in the 1993 San Simeon, 
was taken down Saturday. He finished fourth, but was cited for interfering with 
D'Hallevant in midstretch and was placed last. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beaten by a nose by Kotashaan in the 1993 San Juan Capistrano, Bien Bien will 
be heavily favored to win the 1 3/4-mile turf race today at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of eight of 24 starts and more than $2 million, the 5-year-old Manila 
horse is 4-5 on the morning line against nine rivals and his price figures to 
be even shorter at post time. McCarron will again ride Bien Bien, who will 
carry only 122 pounds. He carried 124 when he won the San Luis Rey Stakes by 5 
1/2 lengths on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Navire, second in the San Luis Rey, is the 9-2 second choice. Stevens will 
ride the 5-year-old, who has yet to win in four American starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairy Garden, a 6-year-old mare, is next at 6-1. She lost by only a length to 
Fraise in the Pan American Handicap last month at Gulfstream Park. Black has 
the mount for trainer Roger Attfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field: Siebe (Fernando Valenzuela), Afaladja (Sal Gonzalez 
Jr.), Grand Flotilla (Delahoussaye), River Rhythm (David Flores), Devinez 
Monsieur (Alex Solis), Alex The Great (Chris Antley) and Emerald Jig (Rafael 
Meza). River Rhythm is also entered in the closing-day San Jacinto Handicap on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, scratched from the Santa Anita Derby because of a leg 
blister, will have seven opponents in the $125,000 Lexington Stakes at 
Keeneland today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux will ride the Private Terms colt, who defeated Brocco and 
Valiant Nature in the San Felipe Stakes last month. Ulises, Sir Walter Lyzalot, 
Ledford, Southern Rhythm, Oakmont, Able Buck and Smart Enough complete the 
field for the 1 1/16-mile race. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Rapan Boy paid $11 and covered the 6 1/2 furlongs on turf in 1:13. . . . Gary 
Jones flew back from Kentucky on Saturday morning after watching Lakeway work 
seven furlongs in 1:26 at Churchill Downs. . . . Fraise, who would have made 
the San Juan Capistrano a more interesting race if he had come west, will 
instead run in the $200,000 Hialeah Turf Cup Handicap today. . . . Navarone, 
who hasn't run since finishing a distant third in the San Gabriel Handicap on 
New Year's Day, is the 5-2 morning-line favorite for the $60,000 Bates Motel 
today. Chris Antley will ride the 6-year-old Irish River horse, who has two 
victories in seven starts on the main track.

COSTA MESA'S MILLER GIVING UP DUTIES AS ATHLETIC DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Myron Miller, who coached Costa Mesa to the Southern Section Division VIII 
football championship game in his second season, has advised the school 
administration that he will not return as athletic director next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller cited the need to raise funds for the football program, and that -- 
coupled with the position as athletic director he held the past two years -- 
consumed too much time.He also said, "there's a conflict of interest if you're 
A.D. and coach of a major sport -- your motives are always questioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller plans to coach football until his children, now in fifth and sixth 
grade, graduate from Costa Mesa. He also volunteered to help with the school's 
wrestling program because he will have time freed up from his administrative 
duties. MARTIN HENDERSON

HE'S A HANDS-ON CRISIS MANAGER; PROFILE: WHEN PLATINUM SOFTWARE FLOUNDERED, 
BOARD MEMBER CARMELO S. SANTORO STEPPED IN. IT'S A ROLE HE'S FAMILIAR WITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN and DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carmelo J. Santoro, who sits on the board of seven high-tech companies, was at 
it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro stepped in as acting chief executive of Platinum Software Corp. a week 
ago, after requesting the resignation of the Irvine-based company's founder, 
chairman and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time Santoro had traded his outside director hat for that 
of crisis manager. In early 1990, he became acting chairman of Ashton-Tate 
Corp. after the Torrance-based company reported a $28-million annual loss and 
its chief executive resigned. Two years later, he took the chairman's seat 
temporarily at AST Research Inc. in Irvine after the ouster of the company's 
co-founder, Tom Yuen, in an internal power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Michnoff, an analyst at Prudential Securities Research in New York, said 
of Santoro, "If you're going to pull a stunt as a manager, he's not the guy to 
have on your board." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he plays his role so dramatically, Santoro has his detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yuen recalls bitterly how Santoro sided with Safi Qureshey, now chairman and 
CEO of AST, in a dispute between the company's founders. Santoro filled in as 
chairman for a year, recruiting seven new executives to shepherd the computer 
maker to its next stage of growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any board he gets on, somehow he becomes chairman," Yuen said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dallas lawyer M.D. Samples, who serves with Santoro on the board of Dallas 
Semiconductor, said that Santoro "epitomizes what a board member should be all 
about. . . . He doesn't just attend meetings, collect his fee and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last week at Platinum's Irvine headquarters, Santoro, 52, 
conceded that "I have the reputation of being Carm the Founder Killer. I'm a 
Mr. Fixer Upper kind of guy; I'm not afraid to make tough decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro asked Platinum chief Gerald R. Blackie and three other executives to 
step down, he said, when it became clear that the accounting software company's 
revenue accounting practices would likely be the subject of shareholder 
lawsuits and a Securities and Exchange Commission probe. The company announced 
that it will have to scale back its revenue from the past four quarters by as 
much as $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SEC wants to see that people who are independent and who are not 
potentially tainted by lawsuits have control of the company," Santoro said. "To 
that end, the four officers resigned so we could clear the way for an SEC 
investigation should (the agency) choose to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 As board member turned acting CEO, Santoro now has to calm investors and 
customers, restructure Platinum, lay off some of its 820 employees, and recruit 
new executives. Already, Santoro has hired a new chief financial officer, 
Michael Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at the head of the accounting software manufacturer, however, is not a 
responsibility that Santoro wants to make into a career. He's had his fill of 
all-consuming top management posts and now enjoys being sought after to serve 
on corporate boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely unwilling over the long haul to go back to being a 
100-hour-a-week guy," Santoro said. "My wife is my first priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Santoro, an interior designer in Rancho Santa Fe, was found to have 
lymphoma in the fall of 1992. The cancer has been in remission for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an experience that changed our lives," her husband said. "Since 1959, 
when I graduated from high school, I have been as career-minded as any person 
who ever lived. But on the day I learned Nancy had cancer, it just turned a 
switch in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York native holds a Ph.D. in physics from Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute in Troy, N.Y. He spent eight years with Motorola, where he directed 
the group that made one of the first microprocessor chips. He served as CEO and 
president of Silicon Systems Inc. in Tustin from 1981 until 1991, during which 
time he took the company from $12 million in annual sales to $180 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At Silicon Systems, Santoro had an "excellent rapport with customers" and 
promoted an open management style that allowed for good communication among 
employees, company spokesman Mark Jorgensen said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, Santoro "started formulating the idea of retiring and 
becoming a professional board member," he said. Today he is an outside director 
of AST Research, Dallas Semiconductor Corp., Silicon Systems and four other 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 His main business priority for now, though, is Platinum Software. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said that he didn't realize the depth of the company's problems until 
a week before the firings were announced, when the accounting firm he hired to 
conduct an audit completed its review. "We didn't know that we were going to 
have to restate earnings to the extent that we will have to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A top priority, he said, is reassuring customers that Platinum has a good 
product. "Our clients are reading the press and doubting what this company 
has," he said. "In fact, the company's people, technology, products and 
business aren't any different this week than they were last week." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, he must calm the fears of Platinum employees. "The word restructuring 
does not exactly reap confidence in the hearts of employees," Santoro said. 
"There may be some layoffs and some products we don't go through with." 
</P>
<P>
 Santoro said he looks forward to finding a replacement for Blackie so that he 
can get back to spending time with his wife, six children and four 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so career-focused that I did not have a great relationship with my 
children when they were young -- I was always working when they needed me," 
Santoro said. "So I really enjoy my grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants to return to his hobbies: painting and writing country-Western 
music. Asked for sample lyrics of one of his songs, Santoro thought for a 
moment and then offered: 
</P>
<P>
 "Without love, there ain't no light at the end of the tunnel."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: HAZARDOUS-WASTE DISPOSER SUED BY FORMER LANDLORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Security Environmental Systems Inc., a hazardous-waste disposer, said Friday 
that it is being sued by the owner of a Vernon warehouse. The company had once 
hoped to convert the site into a hazardous-waste incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Under intense community pressure, Security Environmental abandoned plans 
several years ago to build the medical-waste burner at the Los Angeles County 
site. The property owner alleges in its suit that Security Environmental owes 
back rent and did not clean up the site, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental President Ellen Batzel defended the company, saying 
that its engineers have left the facility pristine and that city officials are 
expected to issue a report confirming that. 
</P>
<P>
 The company did not comment on the allegations that it owes back rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental also said that it is being sued for allegedly breaking 
an oral agreement to pay 250,000 shares of its common stock for services 
allegedly rendered to the company in 1990.

MODEM OPERANDI; O.C. INVESTIGATORS AND DATA CENTERS ARE THRIVING IN THE AGE OF 
ELECTRONIC INFORMATION. BUT, FEARING LOSS OF PRIVACY AND SAFETY, SOME VICTIMS' 
RIGHTS GROUPS AND LAWMAKERS ARE PUSHING TO RESTRICT SUCH ACCESS.

<P>
 For the street-smart gumshoe of Hollywood fame, the price paid for cracking a 
tough case was usually a broken rib or a black eye. A more likely occupational 
hazard for the private investigator of the mid-'90s is eye strain or a sore 
wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 With hundreds of public and corporate records accessible through on-line 
computer databases, private investigators are spending more time using personal 
computers and modems to get the facts they need, and less time hanging out on 
street corners or slipping a five to an informant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live at Big Bear Lake. I couldn't live here and still do my work without 
on-line services," says Cindy Erdelyi, a private investigator. "It's an extreme 
timesaver. You can take a look and get (court) case numbers, names and then go 
do your (face-to-face) research." 
</P>
<P>
 The continually updated databases encompass nearly the entire realm of human 
activity. They include marriage and divorce records, civil and criminal 
convictions, credit reports, property transactions, driving records, bankruptcy 
filings, voter registration and fictitious business names. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides saving shoe leather, computer searching has expanded investigators' 
service offerings and has turned what once might have been dead ends into 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, Erdelyi, in helping a Southern California woman find the 
daughter she gave up for adoption 30 years ago, followed a computer trail to an 
Indiana address, where the daughter's last known driver's license had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, I might have felt I was at a dead end at that point," 
Erdelyi said. "But I was able to use a series of nationwide databases that pick 
up magazine subscribers' changes of address, new addresses reported to 
creditors -- things that people report routinely when they move. 
</P>
<P>
 "She turned up in Texas, but with an unlisted phone number. So the mother . . 
. was able to write to her, and they had a happy reunion, because it turned out 
her daughter had also been looking for the mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie E. Smith, an investigator with the 30-person investigative firm 
Santoni, Skrifvars and Damerell in Tustin, says she spends at least an hour 
each day on-line. "Back in the old days, investigators were called gumshoes 
because they were always on their feet," she said. "But not everything now has 
to be done in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The availability of locater databases, which include magazine publishers' 
change-of-address records, mailing lists and phone directories, has fueled a 
rise in companies that specialize in locating people. One such firm is Find 
People Fast of St. Louis. For $29, the company uses various databases to 
assemble a list of phone numbers of up to 99 people who use the same name as 
the person being sought. If the customer knows the person's social security 
number, the fee is $25. 
</P>
<P>
 But many people don't want to be found. And many think that what makes life a 
little easier for detectives, journalists and lawyers is too often used to 
infringe on their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by victims' rights groups, House legislators last week voted to limit 
the release of address data from motor vehicle departments nationwide. In 
January, the U.S. Postal Service -- in a similar attempt to thwart stalkers' 
ability to track potential victims -- announced it would begin studying a 
policy of restricting access to change-of-address data. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nation's 40,000 or so licensed investigators, many prefer to do their 
research the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some investigators won't touch a computer," says Leroy Cook of Ion Inc., a 
nationwide referral and screening service of investigative agencies. "These 
investigators are great interviewers and love to talk to people. They do good 
groundwork. Of course, if they really need some data, they'll go down the hall 
and use a colleague's" computer. 
</P>
<P>
 John M. Pentecost, a Los Angeles civil investigator for 30 years, scorns 
reliance on computer searches. 
</P>
<P>
 "In investigating civil suits, it doesn't do you any good to simply know about 
a suit's existence; you have to go to the courthouse to read the suit so you 
know what it's about," he said. "So why not just go there in the first place 
and look at their indexes right there?" 
</P>
<P>
 On-line services merely cut down on the expense of one part of the 
investigator's workload, said Jack Reed of Information Resource Service Co., a 
database reseller based in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The databases are not panaceas or a utopia. They're merely a place where hard 
data is stored," he said. "Then it's up to the investigator to go into the 
field and verify that data." 
</P>
<P>
 At CDB Infotek, a large database service in Santa Ana, about 3,000 
investigators nationwide pay a monthly $25 fee, plus a charge for each on-line 
search, to access more than 1,800 databases, president Rick Rozar says. 
</P>
<P>
 CDB personnel assemble their listings of public and corporate data from 
various source media. These data sources often are magnetic tape, but 
sometimes, as in many New York jurisdictions, records are kept on archaic 
3-by-5 cards, which require on-site key-stroking, Rozar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-old company's most popular databases among investigators are civil 
court litigation records. "Investigators use these a lot for personal-injury 
actions, looking for prior injury cases, and also for due-diligence 
investigations of businesses," Rozar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many investigators also supplement on-line services by buying certain data, 
such as nationwide phone directories, on computer CD-ROM drives. According to 
Gregory Estevane of Professional Investigations in San Diego, a researcher will 
buy five years of civil court data on microfiche, transfer it to compact discs 
and sell it to investigators for as much as $1,000. The disadvantage is that 
the discs, unlike regularly updated computer files, must eventually be replaced 
with updated ones, Estevane says. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators who access California motorists' Department of Motor Vehicles 
address data through on-line services are subject to state audits to ensure 
that the information is used for legitimate court or insurance purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Database resellers say they use lengthy applications and sometimes on-site 
office checks to try to ensure the legitimacy of potential subscribers. "No 
individual is going to get into our system who doesn't belong there," Reed 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, who holds seminars for clients to discuss privacy laws and guidelines 
for handling personal information, resents what he says is a smarmy image of 
investigators conveyed by Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to look at private investigators as slugs, as portrayed in movies 
and TV," he said. "In fact, private investigators save the public . . . money 
by helping uncover insurance and workers' compensation fraud. If you had to 
hire government agencies to do what investigators do, the cost would probably 
quadruple." 
</P>
<P>
 In the debate over the ethics of releasing personally identifiable 
information, private investigators are criticized for being of potential 
assistance to abusive spouses and stalkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern with private investigators is that they don't seem to have any 
real restriction on who they'll work for. To some extent they're hired guns," 
says David Beatty of the National Victim Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as they're willing to be paid, they'll go out and find someone. In 
cases such as (finding) runaways, they can do good work, but in tracking down 
victims who are literally fleeing for their lives and trying not to be found, 
they're victims' worst enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say the benefits of access to public records outweigh any 
invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy for a person to say, 'I don't want anybody looking up my personal 
information,' " says Eddy McClain, former president of the California Assn. of 
Licensed Investigators. "But if you ask them, 'OK, but are you willing to give 
up your credit cards and the ability to get a home loan?' they quickly change 
their mind." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some privacy advocates insist that personal information should be used only 
for the purposes for which the consumer originally gave it. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse at the University of 
San Diego, fields many calls at her hot line from consumers angry at the 
intrusive way they've been targeted by marketers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question is, 'Should we look at any kind of regulation that talks 
about how personal information in public records is used?' " Givens said. "We 
don't advocate locking up public records, but it's time to analyze the wide 
availability of records and what that means for a person's privacy. The main 
reason to have public records is so we, the public, can figure out what the 
government is doing (with) tax dollars. The sale of public records for uses 
other than this watchdog function is not in line with the original reason for 
making public records public." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the problem of stalkers, victims' rights groups are at the forefront in 
the drive to restrict access to DMV and post office address data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, private investigators have developed skills to access information 
systems in ways that aren't apparent to the average offender," said Beatty, 
referring to a tragedy that continues to dog private investigators: the 1989 
handgun murder of Los Angeles actress Rebecca Schaeffer by an obsessed fan. To 
locate Schaeffer, her assailant hired an investigator, who went to the DMV to 
provide him with her new address. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the murder, California legislators passed a law restricting the 
release of DMV address data, except to courts, law enforcement agencies and 
insurance companies. In part through the use of identifying chips in their PCs, 
licensed investigators who gather DMV address data in their work for such 
agencies are audited by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Santoni, president of Santoni, Skrifvars & Damerell, was audited 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in and see the operation and make sure you're keeping an adequate 
log," Santoni said. "All the employees sign a security agreement."  
</P>
<P>
 In February, private investigators joined journalists in testifying at 
congressional hearings on a House resolution, the Driver's Privacy Protection 
Act of 1993, that would place limits on the release of motorists' addresses by 
DMV personnel in all 50 states. It would allow motorists the chance to request 
that their personal data be withheld from marketers and other private 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 McClain testified that investigators should be able to maintain their access 
to the DMV data. The bill, similar to legislation introduced in October by Sen. 
Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), was written "under the premise that it will improve 
personal privacy, but it penalizes people who use them for lawful purposes," 
McClain said.  
</P>
<P>
 After those hearings, the resolution was rewritten to provide investigators 
with access similar to what they now have in California. It passed a House vote 
Wednesday as an amendment to the combined House and Senate crime bill and is 
scheduled to come before both houses for a final vote by mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week in California, a bill to restrict public access to voter 
registration records was approved by the Senate Elections Committee and sent to 
the Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators vow to keep fighting for their right to access public records. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are plenty of laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act, already on 
the books to take care of civil and criminal abuses," McClain said. "Once you 
start closing public records, it's the nose of the camel in the tent. The 
databases will eventually dry up. You will have a more closed society, like 
China or Russia."

ALL HAIL THE TAXI COURT; NEW YORK HAS ITS OWN WAY OF DEALING WITH CABBIES WHO 
CHEAT OR ASSAIL THEIR PASSENGERS AND RACE THROUGH RESIDENTIAL ZONES AT 60 
M.P.H. AND GET THIS: JUSTICE IS RELATIVELY SWIFT -- AND SWEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a New Yorker braced for life's insults, Jeff Bilhuber thought he'd seen it 
all: Panhandlers who curse your unborn children; trains that catch fire in 
darkened tunnels; traffic jams that turn passengers into pit bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was all just a warm-up for the cabby who kicked him in the ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 On a rainy night last year, Bilhuber and three friends grabbed a taxi for a 
short ride to a Manhattan bistro. When he gave the woman driver a 50-cent tip 
along with his $3 fare -- a standard gratuity -- she erupted with fury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was called obscene names and told to pay more," says Bilhuber, an interior 
decorator. "So I refused and got angry. After getting out of the cab, I left my 
door open on purpose. I didn't like the way I'd been treated." Neither did the 
cabby, who chased Bilhuber down the street, cornered him in a stairwell and 
kicked him in the ribs. When he protested, she kicked him again and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stunned," he recalls. "It was the most violent cab ride I'd ever had 
and it was a woman, for goodness sakes. You can only get pushed so far in this 
life. There comes a time when you have to get some justice." 
</P>
<P>
 A time, Bilhuber learned, for taxi court. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York's fraying urban fabric, there is an occasional golden thread, and 
the rough-and-ready court set up by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission to 
hear civilian cab complaints is one. Other legal chambers may look more regal, 
but few are as efficient or satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in a dingy office building near Times Square, taxi court screens about 
12,000 cases each year, promising quick action to people who don't usually 
fight city hall. Here, in a windowless hearing room, the crook who took Aunt 
Mildred five miles out of her way to JFK Airport gets his comeuppance. Here, 
the boor who blasted 60 m.p.h. down a residential street will face the music. 
Did a white cabby tell a black customer to get lost? Let him tell it to the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice is relatively swift -- and sweet. Simply fill out a complaint form and 
wait two or three months for your case to be called. A typical hearing before 
an impartial administrator takes 15 to 20 minutes and, says Jane Polisar, chief 
counsel for the busy metropolitan court, more than 75% of judgments go against 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, civility may be for suckers, but taxi violations are no joke. 
Judges can fine drivers $200 or more for refusing to take people where they 
want to go. A cabby can be out $300 for abusing customers. In extreme cases, a 
judge can suspend a driver's taxi permit for 30 days or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Levana Mizrahi, the stocky cab driver who beat up Bilhuber. 
</P>
<P>
 When their day in court arrives, the two glare at each other in a small 
hearing room. Mizrahi is flanked by a "taxi representative," a civilian 
advocate who has no legal training. The driver pleads her case before a judge 
who is a moonlighting lawyer, and the noisy proceedings are taped on a cheap 
recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Mizrahi insists that she wasn't working on the night in question. 
Then she changes her strategy, recalling the incident with great clarity and 
claiming that the four passengers were abusive drunks who scared her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I look like a monster?" she asks, tugging a woolen hat over her ears and 
shifting imperiously in a plastic chair. "I am only a lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Peter Mazer is not impressed. He fines the driver $700 and suspends her 
taxi permit for 30 days. It all takes less than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilhuber is amazed. "Now that's service," he says with a grin. "Am I happy? I 
am indeed." 
</P>
<P>
 You get a different story out in the waiting room, where dozens of unhappy 
cabbies assemble daily for their cases to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a goddamn kangaroo court," mutters Samuel Taylor, a 20-year veteran 
of New York's mean, potholed streets. "In this place, you're guilty until 
proven innocent. And everybody's got their hands in your pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, cabby Artimio Nunez nods in agreement. "You know how I'd get justice 
in these hearings?" he whispers. "With a machine gun. That's the only thing 
these people understand." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New York is a city of never-ending wars. Landlords and tenants. Immigrants and 
old-timers. Uptown and downtown. Yet few conflicts endure like cabby and 
passenger. In the Big Apple, stories of taxi trauma are bandied about at 
cocktail parties and rehashed over dinner as the stuff of legend. 
</P>
<P>
 The taxi industry generates $1 billion in annual profits and transports an 
estimated 200 million people each year, according to TLC reports. There are 
more than 32,000 cabbies prowling the streets, and New Yorkers depend on them 
for everything from daily commutes to airport runs and shopping. Fewer people 
here own cars than in any other American city, and many residents have no 
choice but to step into the street, raise their hands and hail a hack. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, passengers may feel like Margaret Mead. Only 16% of New York drivers 
speak English as their main language and fewer than 10% of new applicants for 
licenses last year were born in America. Most drivers come from India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Africa, the Caribbean or the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, hacking is a bargain. Where else in America can newcomers make $500 
to $600 a week for an eight-hour work shift, with little or no qualifications? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the novelty can wear thin. Every New Yorker has stories about drivers who 
get hopelessly lost and need a map for simple directions. On occasion, cultural 
differences create problems for passengers, especially American women, who 
assert their rights and tell cabbies to drive more safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most cab rides are uneventful, they can turn nightmarish in a second. 
Drivers are forever griping about customers who stiff them on fares. They worry 
even more about riders who become disorderly -- and may well be armed. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be a deadly crapshoot: Last year, 42 New York cabbies were killed by 
passengers, mostly after dark in areas such as Harlem, Brooklyn and the Bronx. 
That led the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to label cab 
driving in Gotham as the nation's most dangerous job in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be more cautious than ever about who you pick up," Taylor says. 
"But that doesn't change the law at all. You can't refuse to take people to 
particular neighborhoods, even if you know in your gut that something's fishy. 
If you try to do that, they'll nail you." 
</P>
<P>
 Refusals, as they're called, are among the most common violations in taxi 
court, chief counsel Polisar says. That rule and others have been strictly 
enforced ever since New York City established the taxi court system in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to be as fair here as we can," she says. "And most drivers know the 
regulations. We make them clear, yet some aren't happy campers." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Mazer says he doesn't blame cabbies for getting angry. But, he adds: 
"This place isn't as one-sided as some of them think. There are many times when 
I'll throw out some of the charges against them, if they really can't be 
proven." 
</P>
<P>
 In this court, nobody stands on ceremony -- and nobody's getting rich. 
Typically, half a dozen or more attorneys act as judges, and they pocket $89 
for a morning or afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may seem like chump change, but the money adds up," one judge says. 
"You're not exactly making a fortune here, but it's steady, basic work." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the taxi advocates get a minimum of $35 for each hearing. New York 
doesn't expect them to be attorneys because most drivers couldn't afford them. 
The only requirements are that advocates pass a background check and show some 
familiarity with the system. After that, they're on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes, as Glenn Moises found out, there are fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a cold night in Greenwich Village, just before Christmas, and Moises 
and a friend were anxious to get back home to Brooklyn. When a yellow cab 
pulled up to the curb, they hopped right in. 
</P>
<P>
 That's as far as they got. 
</P>
<P>
 The cabby, Victor Greenberg, eyed the two men suspiciously. Moises is Latino, 
his companion black, and the driver claims that gut instinct told him to be 
wary. He demanded money upfront to make sure he'd get paid. That is highly 
illegal, and Moises, a veteran New York probation officer, told him so. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men quarreled and Greenberg refused to budge; he ordered the riders 
out and drove off, glad to be rid of them. 
</P>
<P>
 His troubles had just begun. Three months later, Greenberg and Moises will 
meet in taxi court. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of representing himself, the cabby has hired Joseph Skifo Jr. as his 
advocate, hoping to get a break from Judge Robert Burstein. Skifo, 36, and 
formerly a mechanic, has represented drivers for 11 years, and what he lacks in 
formal education he makes up for in attitude and television smarts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know much about lawyers, but I watch 'em on TV and pick up tips," 
Skifo explains. "Like that blond lady in L.A. who defended the Menendez case? 
She may be abrasive, but she gets results. Just like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg looks hopeful as he enters the darkened hearing room. But he might 
just as well have stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you know that asking riders for money in advance is illegal?" the judge 
asks. "It's incredible to me that you don't know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg tries to wriggle off the hook, but his comments only make things 
worse. Did he fail to take the two men to Brooklyn because one of them was 
black? Burstein asks. Looking flustered, the cabby concedes the point. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge finds Greenberg guilty. It adds up to $400 in fines, payable 
immediately, even if the cabby appeals to a special city commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's outrageous!" Greenberg shouts. "That's outrageous!" 
</P>
<P>
 Moises ignores him, telling the judge he wants to keep track of the case. He 
has no intention of letting this matter slip through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, so you can see me hang," the cabby snaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Moises rises to his feet and threatens to have the driver arrested. The judge 
calls for quiet, but Skifo stirs to life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait a minute! He didn't threaten you!" the advocate shouts at Moises. "You 
threatened him! This is a free country. You can say what you want!" 
</P>
<P>
 Moises bolts the room in a fury, his victory tainted. Skifo waits for him to 
disappear down the hallway, then turns to his livid client. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you pay $400 for a scumbag, it's not worth it," Skifo advises. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Burstein erupts, his face reddening, his hands trembling: "If I had the 
power, I'd hold you in contempt, Mr. Skifo!" he booms. "You can't talk about 
people that way. I'll have order in here!" 
</P>
<P>
 For a few seconds, taxi court stops in its tracks. Judges poke their heads out 
of hearing rooms to check out the commotion; other cabbies gape at Greenberg as 
he storms from the second-story offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just as suddenly, calm returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes things can get a little hot around here," Burstein says with a weak 
smile. "But if you ask me, it's all about quality of life in a big city. When 
it comes to quality of life, people get very excited."

GETTING A LEGAL LIFT AFTER A TAXI NIGHTMARE 
</P>

<P>
 If you have an unpleasant experience in a taxicab, your options differ from 
one city to the next. While New York has one of the more intricate systems for 
resolving grievances, other communities also offer relief. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, consumers can call the Department of Transportation at (213) 
485-2758 to register complaints ranging from over-charging to reckless driving. 
The city receives between 3,000 and 4,000 such complaints a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have clear taxicab rules, and if they're violated, the driver can be 
suspended," investigator Donald Mansion says. If a complaint is deemed 
legitimate -- about a thousand are each year -- a hearing in which consumers 
participate may be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has about 5,000 licensed drivers, and one of the lowest ratios of 
cabs per 1,000 citizens for a large American city, according to the 
International Taxicab and Livery Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 After New York, the second-largest concentration is in Atlanta, where a 
complaint system similar to Los Angeles' exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only look at about 200 complaints a year, which doesn't sound like a lot," 
says Sam Rembert, who works in Atlanta's Vehicles for Hire Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we give people the chance to be heard, to confront the drivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta licenses about 3,000 hackers, and they're required to defend 
themselves before a mayoral commission when citizens file complaints, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans, which ranks third behind Atlanta, reviews several hundred 
complaints a year, says Orias Buckner, who works with the city's taxi bureau. 
Many complaints about the city's 1,640 cabbies are filed by tourists, who don't 
always have the ability to follow up their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have an out-of-town person who gets overcharged, he may only realize 
it too late, when he's ready to go home," Buckner says. "We might get a phone 
call, but the driver can get away scot-free, because these people aren't going 
to come back here. It's a concern, but what can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are similar problems with tourists in Boston, which has 6,000 licensed 
cabbies. But investigators are constantly weeding out minor infractions from 
the about 3,100 complaints lodged yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hear something like, 'The cabby cut me off and then gave me the 
finger,' we'll give the guy a slap on the wrist and tell him to watch it," says 
Officer David Bent, with the police department's Hackney-Carriage unit. Other 
violations, such as refusing to take people where they want to go, are dealt 
with more sternly. 
</P>
<P>
 In Boston, a third violation of that rule can lead to the permanent revocation 
of a cabby's license. Hearings are held before such action is taken, with both 
sides presenting witnesses and hiring attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody says they were cheated out of 20 cents, we're not going to get 
too excited," Bent says. "But if some driver won't go to an area for (racial) 
reasons, we'll get involved. There's only so much you can regulate." JOSH

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions this past week affecting Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * HOME HEIGHT LIMIT: Approved an ordinance that lowers the maximum allowable 
height of a single-family home to 33 feet from 45 feet. However, if 40% or more 
of the existing single-family dwellings on the same street have heights 
exceeding 33 feet, the maximum height for the home shall be the average height 
of homes on that street. The main objectives of the ordinance include 
protecting street scapes from structures that are incompatible with surrounding 
houses and protecting the rights to privacy of neighboring properties. 
</P>
<P>
 * WATER RATES: Approved an ordinance that will lower water rates for 
high-volume water consumers between June 1 and Oct. 31. During that period, 
when more water is used than at any other time of year, the charge for water 
that exceeds the basic usage amount set by the city will be lowered to $2.33 
per 100 cubic feet from $2.98 per 100 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * MARKET LOAN: Authorized the Community Development Department to provide a 
small-business loan, not to exceed $450,000, to Tri-Afram Associates Inc. to 
buy inventory and equipment for a new store, the Adams West Town Center Market. 
The 10,800-square-foot market is to be at Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * CLEANUP FUNDING: Approved the use of $15,000 in Community Development 
Department funds for the cleanup of the closed Esquire Boys and Girls club at 
81st Street and Vermont Avenue. The vacant building has been frequently 
vandalized and contributes to blight in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET SIGN USE: Approved a motion instructing the Department of 
Transportation to report on the number of Brooklyn Avenue, Brooklyn Place, 
Sunset Boulevard and Macy Street street signs that have been replaced by Cesar 
Chavez Avenue signs, and to consider donating them to nonprofit organizations 
for display at neighborhood centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET CLOSURE: Approved the closure of 53rd Street between Hoover Street 
and Vermont Avenue on Friday from 11 a.m. until the conclusion of the 
Economically Positive celebration sponsored by the African-American Unity 
Center. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * DEBRIS REMOVAL: Instructed the Board of Public Works to notify all 
demolition contractors of the option of disposing non-recyclable debris created 
by the Jan. 17 earthquake by railroad at the rate of $38.25 per ton. The waste 
would be loaded onto Southern Pacific rail cars and sent to a landfill in Utah. 
Passed 10-2. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Rita Walters, Nate Holden, Jackie 
Goldberg. Voting no: Mark-Ridley Thomas. Absent: Mike Hernandez, Rudy Svorinich 
Jr. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

VOICES: HEY, IT'S HOME; DESPITE CATASTROPHES, THIS CITY'S A VERY GOOD PLACE TO 
LIVE AND WORK, SAYS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE KOREAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. 
SO HE COOKED UP THE 'I STILL LOVE L.A.' CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Wyma, Harrison Kim's campaign began Feb. 1 and features bumper 
stickers, T-shirts and caps. Kim, 29, was born in South Korea and came to the 
United States at age 9. He is a graduate of Cal State Northridge. He was 
interviewed by Mike Wyma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reason we started the campaign is that after the earthquake, a lot of 
agencies were doing their best to help people with monetary and physical aid, 
and we wanted to work on the emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea didn't come just from the earthquake. After the riots, L.A. was 
getting a lot of negative press and talk. Not just in the Korean community, but 
in general. So I had the idea that we need to do something to remind people, 
not just outside of L.A. but especially people who live here, that this is 
still a very good place to live and work. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was just an idea until the earthquake. Then the same emotional roller 
coaster was happening to people as after the riots. They were getting depressed 
and they were talking about leaving the city, moving the business and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our Chamber of Commerce is a very small organization, but we wanted to send 
the message to the general L.A. community that Korean business people are proud 
of this city, that we want to stay and work, and we see a future in this city. 
</P>
<P>
 We sell the bumper stickers for $1 apiece, and any money left over goes to the 
Salvation Army. Some people buy one or two. Some buy 20 and send them to their 
family and friends. We recently expanded to the hats and T-shirts. We're 
selling them at just above cost and we expect to break even, if that. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year when the anniversary of the riots was coming, Koreatown was very 
apprehensive. The second trial of the officers was winding up and no one knew 
how it would turn out. There was a lot of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 But like for the rest of Los Angeles, the conclusion of the trial put an end 
to that. People think it's time to move on, to get on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The riot was our wake-up call to do something about crime. This area has one 
of the highest crime rates in the city. The community has been more involved in 
working with the police, giving them information, letting them know what kinds 
of problems we have. And just understanding how the Police Department works. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been progress. Crime went down a little last year. But we have more 
to do. Koreatown is divided into two police divisions, Rampart and Wilshire. 
Our goal is to have it under one jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What people really like about the slogan "I Still Love L.A." is the still 
part. When I originally was laying it out, I just had "I Love L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 But it looked very boring. I wanted to do something to catch people's eye so I 
put in the still. We didn't think about the marketing plan, we just wanted to 
roll. We had the bumper stickers printed a week after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason people are down on L.A. is we had it so good for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 While other parts of the country and the world were going through recession, 
depression, whatever you like to call it, people in L.A. were living very well. 
Business was pretty good.  
</P>
<P>
 When things started going bad, people couldn't remember it being like that 
before. It was emotionally and financially much more difficult. If you've been 
through bad times, you're much more prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Korean community, even with the lack of language, business people have 
succeeded. Only recently did they start having financial difficulties. This was 
new to them. They didn't know how to do the financial planning to adapt to a 
low point in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad things happen along with the good. It's part of a cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 I've lived in this city two-thirds of my life and I love this city. 
</P>
<P>
 Even on Wilshire Boulevard, where it's surrounded by Koreatown, you see the 
diversity. You see Caucasians, Indians, African Americans, Hispanics, and that 
brings out creativity in people, fresh ideas and new types of businesses. I see 
it as a tremendous asset. 
</P>
<P>
 Koreans have been criticized for owning liquor stores in the areas where the 
riots were. But you have to remember that liquor is only part of their 
business. If those liquor stores weren't there, where would people buy milk? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the '60s the markets were owned by Jewish Americans and after the Watts 
riots they left the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Korean Americans moved in. Now it seems that Koreans are going to move 
out. People are getting frustrated and even getting killed. They'll slowly move 
out and you're going to have a new immigrant group taking over, because with 
the high risk, people can start a business relatively cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 I know some people who started with $15,000. They basically took over a dead 
store. The whole family went in. One of the main criticisms Koreans got was 
that they don't hire from the community. But the whole family works. That's how 
they keep expenses down. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the business owners are first generation, born and raised in Korea, 
and came here in adulthood. A lot of the problems and misperceptions arise 
because they aren't able to effectively communicate with their neighbors and 
customers.  
</P>
<P>
 They can communicate for a business deal, but aren't able to communicate on a 
personal level, to strike up a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you have people like myself who were born in Korea but educated in the 
United States, or were born here. We understand both cultures. We're like the 
bridge. You have a lot of businesses that have been taken over by the younger 
generations. So in time a lot of the problems will go away.

VOICES: ISSUE: WHAT HAS CHANGED IN YOUR COMMUNITY SINCE THE RIOTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Mark Ridley-Thomas, City Councilman, 8th District A considerable amount has 
been done in the way of rebuilding. In many instances, it was the corporate 
kind of facilities, such as grocery stores and gas stations, that were looted 
or destroyed. These were companies with substantial credit lines and the 
ability to rebound. Some smaller stores have come back as well, but there's a 
lot to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 The human relations of the city have a long way to go still. It makes no sense 
to put this issue on the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the public and private sectors have not done enough to deal with what 
is a very complex situation. This is an unprecedented phenomenon we are faced 
with in being the most diverse city known to humankind. We're without example 
and we're trying to feel our way through that. * Mike Hernandez, City 
Councilman, 1st District There's a lot of leadership emerging in the district. 
And when you empower a community, it's long-lasting. There's been a lot of 
community participation in this process. For instance, we now have neighborhood 
organizations forming child-care centers, and a lot more community groups -- 
like the Central American Resource Center -- are being recognized by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more understanding among the ethnic groups because they are working 
together more. I see a different kind of atmosphere. There's a lot more 
attention being paid to the district. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We've done more than our fair share of building back what was lost. A good 
percentage of the buildings that were affected have been reconstructed. I 
credit the people of Pico-Union with really starting the cleanup process. * 
Jerry Yu, executive director, Korean American Coalition The riots really were 
the most devastating thing for the Korean American community in its history. 
The community will never be the same again for a lot of different reasons. Not 
only because of the things that were damaged and destroyed, but it's had an 
ancillary affect on other areas of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of Korean Americans patronize Korean American businesses. A lot of these 
same businesses are financed by Korean American banks. These had great losses 
-- as did people like lawyers and accountants who depend on businesses for 
their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear to us last year that the government was not going to come in and 
rescue L.A. If we want to restore some of L.A. to the way it was, then we're 
going to have to do it ourselves. * Carlos Vaquerano, director of public 
information, Central American Resource Center There have not been any dramatic 
changes in Pico-Union. We still have the same problems -- poverty, gangs, 
violence. If anything, it's slightly worse. Not because of the disturbances, 
but because of the recession that's still continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 More attention has been focused on the community. Corporations like Arco have 
come in and helped. Unfortunately, it seems like there has to be an event like 
the disturbances to bring attention to areas like this. But there has not been 
much investment. Compared to areas like South-Central, we really haven't 
received anything. * Craig Herron, LAPD officer , 77th Street Division There's 
a different community attitude. The unemployment is worse and the social 
problems are still here. But there's a different attitude, a better attitude. I 
know the Police Department has a good attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 We hit a low point two years ago. When there's rioting, you can't go much 
lower than that. But I think the community feels a lot better about things now. 
I don't know whether (the riots) were letting off steam or what. I'd hate to 
speculate about that. But if you come down here, you can feel the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 There's always been good people here and there will always be good people 
here. That's who we work for. We don't always see them because we come in 
contact with so many bad people. * Father Pete Neeley, Dolores Mission Catholic 
Church The Eastside has benefited from a lot of the Rebuild LA projects. We've 
gotten money and services from the city (and) they've come over and helped us 
with some projects.  
</P>
<P>
 There's been a heightened awareness of the different racial problems that 
we've had in the past. Plus there's a lot more sensitivity on the part of the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's been more positive than negative as far as the changes go. But it's 
still bad here. It's not a case of neglect, but we didn't riot here so we 
haven't had as much of the attention as other areas have received. * Linda 
Griego, president and CEO, Rebuild L.A. I'm an 18-year resident of Baldwin 
Hills, and the impact of the civil unrest was very much right there. I've seen 
great improvement but there's been a slowness on other parts. On Crenshaw 
Boulevard, there's been a great difference from two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen a lot of the rebuilding process, but there's still a lot of vacant 
lots. As a resident, having to drive through it, it upsets me. The longer the 
lots are vacant, the more people tend to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 There's been a notoriety for community groups. They've been in the trenches a 
long time, but now they are getting more recognition. There's no doubt we just 
have to keep pressing on. You've got the infrastructure there in a lot of 
places. It's just a matter of filling in. * Carmelo Alvarez, director of Human 
Services, California Conservation Corps, MacArthur Park What's happened in the 
last two years is that it hasn't gotten better. We have a new mayor now who 
represents what I guess you call the dominant culture. (Now) the emphasis is on 
law enforcement. . . . community policing as opposed to more education, more 
economic development. Because of the violence, the repression has increased 
instead of getting at the real causes, which are poor distribution of wealth 
and (a lack of) education. * Kiak Tae, student at Cleveland High, Echo Park In 
my opinion, things have changed. People are more friendly, I think, because 
they learned what can happen. Things can't get worse than (a riot). 
</P>
<P>
 It's kind of scary, but a lot of people have learned from what happened. They 
learned that selfishness can't achieve anything but community destruction. But 
I'm more scared since the riots. I still won't go out at night. * Mark Hayden, 
unemployed, Downtown It seems to be more peaceful now. There's not as much 
tension. I don't notice much racial tension. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's how it is where I live. Are people trying to understand each 
other? I don't think people think that far. At least not street people. Maybe 
other people do. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never felt unsafe. If something were to happen, it's going to happen. I 
still go out at night. * Precious Bryan, office technician, South-Central It's 
calmed down in the last two years. The store owners are nicer; everybody's not 
so uptight. The police have pretty much settled down. But at the same time, 
they've got their guards up. 
</P>

 (The civil unrest) hurt our community, I know that. People are more 
understanding now; there's more respect. But that's not a permanent change. Not 
at all. * Veronica Bencomo, assistant director of Human Services, California 
Conservation Corps, Highland Park The gangs in the neighborhood where I grew up 
have gotten closer. They're all together as one. But there's more tension 
between Chicanos and blacks. I feel, as a youth, that part of the problem is 
that we don't understand our own culture, so how are we supposed to understand 
someone else's? 
</P>
<P>
 If the youth understand more about their culture and other cultures, they 
would understand where other opinions are coming from. You have to educate the 
youth first.

SPRING ROUNDUP; NO. 1 LOYOLA PLAYS IT SAFE AND STUMBLES

 Playing it safe doesn't always pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loyola boys' volleyball squad played a match uncharacteristic to their 
style Monday and lost to host Harvard-Westlake, 15-12, 13-15, 16-14, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasting about three hours, the Southern Section Division I match was worthy of 
a final, pitting the two top teams in a Mission League contest that drew more 
than 200 spectators. The result snapped No. 1 Loyola's 11-game winning streak 
and puts both teams in a position to share the league championship. The 
Wolverines (11-1, 10-1) dropped their only match to Loyola (11-1, 8-1) earlier 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs' aggressive, beach-style jump serves were absent, and in some 
instances, what should have been sure serves fell short instead.  
</P>
<P>
 "The jump serve is a high-risk serve, so we tried to keep the ball down and in 
play," said Cubs Coach Derrick Lucero.  
</P>
<P>
 But even then, the Cubs gave up several key points on communication blunders 
that had setters crashing into each other over easy air balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had problems focusing," Lucero said. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point came in the hourlong second game when the Cubs came back 
from a 9-2 deficit to tie it at 10, then held off six game points before Dan 
Farmer hit the ball into the net. Farmer spiked 12 kills in the match. 
Wolverine Matt Sebree led all spikers with 30 kills while the Cubs' leading 
scorer was Brad Walsh with 20 kills. VOLLEYBALL

 Bell catcher Jose Lopez was battered and bruised but he managed to get in the 
last lick. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, suffering from a sprained ankle and sore forearm, hit the game-winning 
RBI single in the bottom of the 16th inning to give Bell a 7-6 Southeastern 
Conference win Thursday at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the bad things that happened to me during the game, it felt good to 
make the winning hit," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez drove in Frank Montero from third base after Montero singled and 
advanced on a two-base fielding error by Roosevelt right fielder Elio Zavala. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his defensive troubles, Zavala was four-for-six with one RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt nearly scored in the top of the 14th, but second baseman Juan Carlos 
Rodriguez, who was one-for-three with four walks, was tagged out at the plate 
by Lopez on Chris Minter's double. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt tied the score at 6 in the seventh when Rodriguez scored on a 
throwing error. 
</P>

CHINA FREES A DISSIDENT LEADER OF 1989 PROTESTS; RIGHTS: WANG JUNTAO LEAVES FOR 
U.S. BEIJING ALSO ANNOUNCES SOME 'UNDERSTANDINGS' ABOUT PRISON VISITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move apparently timed to influence President Clinton's crucial decision 
on U.S.-China trade relations, Chinese officials on Saturday released leading 
dissident Wang Juntao from a hospital cell where he had been receiving 
treatment for hepatitis and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement coordinated with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, Wang, 
described in a government report as one of the "black hands" behind the 1989 
pro-democracy movement, was granted release on bail for medical treatment in 
the United States. Saturday morning, authorities placed him aboard a United 
Airlines flight to New York, where his wife and fellow dissident, Hou Xiaotian, 
is a visiting scholar at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development that is likely to be viewed as a positive step by 
Clinton Administration officials, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Saturday 
that some "understandings" about visits to Chinese prisons have been reached 
with the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have said repeatedly that Red Cross prison inspections would 
constitute an important sign of progress on human rights in China. 
Representatives of the Swiss Red Cross office have been meeting with Red Cross 
Society of China officials here all week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides agreed that the meeting had produced positive results," a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments come just weeks before Clinton must decide whether to renew 
China's most-favored-nation trading status. The United States is China's 
biggest export market for products ranging from clothing to toys, but Clinton 
has said he will renew the trade benefits only if Beijing makes "significant 
progress" on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, 35, had headed U.S. and human rights organization lists of political 
prisoners in Chinese jails. He is the most prominent activist from the 1989 
democracy movement to have been released by authorities here. 
</P>
<P>
 In a summit meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Seattle last 
November, Clinton specifically called for the release of Wang, thought to be 
suffering from a heart condition as well as hepatitis B, a potentially fatal 
disease that attacks the liver. He contracted the hepatitis during treatment by 
a prison dentist, his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, beginning shortly before an official visit to China by 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, police have conducted a series of 
detentions and arrests of dissidents. Celebrated dissident leader Wei Jingsheng 
was arrested, released, then arrested again April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some diplomats characterized the detentions as a purely internal 
matter, they were also widely viewed as a defiant gesture on the part of the 
Chinese leadership against U.S. human rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Consistent with past practice, the Chinese waited for a major American news 
event, in this case the death of former President Richard Nixon, before 
releasing Wang. In doing so, they hoped that news of his release would be lost 
in the volume of stories on Nixon, who reopened relations with China with a 
historic visit here in 1972 and who was described in the Chinese press as "an 
old friend of the Chinese people." 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights advocates reacted with mixed feelings to the release of Wang. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Munro, chief of the Asia Watch office in Hong Kong, said the release of 
Wang had "great symbolic significance" but worried that it also might be a form 
of forced exile that will prevent Wang from returning to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang began his political career in 1976, when he was jailed after 
participating in protests critical of Mao Tse-tung and other Chinese leaders. 
Since then, he has been an outspoken advocate of democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the 1989 democracy protests at Tian An Men Square, Wang was tracked 
down after a nationwide manhunt and branded a mastermind, or "black hand," 
behind the protests. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening days of the movement, Chinese authorities said that hundreds 
of thousands of naive students, and later millions of ordinary citizens, were 
being manipulated by a small group of "black hands" intent on overthrowing the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part in the protests, Wang was put on trial in 1991 on charges of 
conspiring to subvert the government and engaging in counterrevolutionary 
propaganda and agitation. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment -- a term Western diplomats 
criticized as harsh in light of Wang's moderate, nonviolent speeches and 
actions during the Tian An Men movement. 
</P>

 Researcher Kevin Platt in The Times' Beijing Bureau contributed to this 
report.

AMERICANS RECALL HEROIC, TRAGIC FIGURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In Orange County's Little Saigon, he was a hero, the American leader who tried 
to stop the Communists from taking over Vietnam. At an Earth Day celebration in 
Palo Alto, he was the man who divided a nation during the turbulent 1960s. And 
in his hometown of Whittier, he was a local boy who rose from humble beginnings 
to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation Saturday, Americans sifted through a complicated mix of 
emotions as they remembered Richard Nixon. One day after the 37th President 
died, he was lauded for improving Cold War relations with the Soviet Union and 
China and vilified for his role in the cover-up of the Watergate break-in. 
</P>
<P>
 In Yorba Linda, crowds gathered throughout the day at the Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace. Mourners stood in small groups on the library's concrete 
steps and approached its closed front doors, where roses, burning candles, 
children's drawings and handwritten notes formed an ever-growing tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy and Shu Ping Yu, a Walnut couple who emigrated from China in 1979, stood 
side by side before the doors, gratefully remembering the man responsible for 
the historic opening to China in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "We care so much for this man," said Shu Ping Yu, 52, blinking back tears as 
he remembered watching Nixon's motorcade pass by him on a Beijing street 22 
years earlier. "Then, I never thought I could be here. He opened the door for 
so many people, for me. He gave us a brand-new life." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Dawn Miller of Yorba Linda was talking quietly to her 5-year-old 
daughter, Ali, as they walked down the steps, past a bed of colorful pansies 
and out toward the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to bring her so that maybe she can remember him too," Miller said. 
"Unfortunately, so many people remember him just for Watergate. I really admire 
the fact that he was able to look beyond that. I want her to know that when you 
make mistakes, you go on and keep trying to do other good things." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, Robert Cornwell, 41, gazed through a white railing entwined with 
bougainvillea at the tiny clapboard farmhouse where Nixon was born. But unlike 
many of the other visitors, Cornwell admitted to a measure of ambivalence about 
the man he had come to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagreed with the man strongly about many things and really felt betrayed 
by Watergate," Cornwell said. "But I also think he made some very tough, good 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, former soldiers offered 
conflicting assessments of the man who presided over some of the bloodiest 
episodes of the Vietnam War but later began the U.S. withdrawal from the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, he got me home 20 days early," said Roy Jessee, 45, a former infantryman 
who was selling T-shirts at a booth to raise money for veterans. He said Nixon 
was no worse than any other White House occupant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just got caught," Jessee said. "Watergate, Whitewater -- what's the 
difference? Nixon was just the scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby tent dedicated to a final accounting of the missing in action, 
veteran Valerie Menard said she prayed for Nixon on Saturday morning. But she 
criticized him for not doing more for the troops she said were left behind in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it that he said everyone was back," Menard said. "That was 
obviously, blatantly false." 
</P>
<P>
 In Yonkers, N.Y., at a small, family-run drugstore, customers praised Nixon as 
a wise statesman whose writings and foreign travels offered a unique 
perspective on the Soviet Union and China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what he wanted to do in the years after (his resignation) was make 
some contribution, and I think he did do that," said Barbara Smith, an 
assistant school principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made some mistakes," she added, "but we all do." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Nixon's home state, the former President was remembered by 
figures ranging from actress Zsa Zsa Gabor to Former Democratic Gov. Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a dedicated liberal, supported Nixon's opponents for Congress, Senate 
and the presidency, and in a statement Saturday he said he was "most proud" of 
his own defeat of Nixon in the 1962 governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagreed in principle and in practice, in ideals and ideas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years there has been a mellowing between Dick Nixon and myself," 
said Brown, who was appointed by Nixon to a commission on the Franklin D. 
Roosevelt Memorial and co-chaired the first U.S. visit of China's table tennis 
team under Nixon's "Ping-Pong diplomacy" of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Nixon invited Brown to the Yorba Linda library to discuss their 
1962 contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is a great healer," Brown said. "President Nixon accomplished some great 
things for our nation. He will be missed by his friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Praise was fervent in some Vietnamese immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the greatest President of the United States and one of the greatest 
leaders of the world," said Dr. Co D. L. Pham, a physician who heads the 
Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Westminster. "When Nixon resigned, all of us 
felt like we lost our President. We respected him and we adored him so much. We 
look at him like a savior." 
</P>
<P>
 Yen Do, editor of the Nguoi Viet Daily News, the community's largest 
newspaper, said: "Everybody knows that he was a very, very strong 
anti-Communist. He was a real hero for the refugees because he was a strong 
anti-Communist and because he was a strong leader." 
</P>
<P>
 A famous former protester against the Vietnam War, state Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica), expressed "compassion" for Nixon, but said he and the former 
President stood at opposite poles of the 1960s "intergenerational breakdown" 
between youth and their World War II-generation parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, who was indicted by the Nixon Administration for inciting a riot 
during the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, faulted the former President 
for failing to understand the youthful rage of that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than seeing the protests that swept the country as a legitimate 
reaction to a war many felt was unjust, Nixon chose to view the dissenters as 
pawns of foreign agents and Communist propaganda, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he could not deal with was that it was an honest reaction to his 
generation," said Hayden, who was attending a rainy Earth Day celebration in 
Palo Alto. "That was what was tragic about Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 In his hometown of Whittier, Nixon was the prime topic of conversation 
Saturday. Many remembered him fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of Nixon, I don't think first of Watergate. I think of foreign 
policy. I think the country is really going to miss his consultation," said one 
resident, Gary Walker. "I think he'll be remembered as a great elder 
statesman." 
</P>
<P>
 At tiny Whittier College, where Nixon was graduated in 1934 before attending 
attending law school at Duke University, flags flew at half-staff. On the 
athletic field of the wooded campus, Nixon and his late wife, Pat, are listed 
among the major underwriting donors of the complex's lighting system. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the college's Hall of Fame, there is a plaque honoring Nixon's 
less-than-illustrious football career. He was a "great inspiration to (the) 
team with halftime pep talks, bench-cheering leadership," the plaque reads. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Hug, who was strolling on the campus with her 9-year-old son, Daniel, was 
a freshman at Whittier High School in 1969. She said she remembers students 
being torn between their allegiance to the home-grown President and their 
growing opposition to the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 She said some came to consider Nixon as "the enemy incarnate." Her own views 
softened over the years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Daniel, who considers himself a history buff, Nixon's death was a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was pretty sad. We lost a President who lived here," he said. 
"He went to school right here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Crenshaw District in Los Angeles, where hundreds gathered for a parade 
honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., many said they had little in common with 
Nixon and his Administration but generally praised the former President as a 
skillful leader in international relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should all be saddened anytime a great leader passes, whether we agree or 
disagree with his policies," said Lynwood Mayor Paul L. Richards. "He made many 
contributions and perhaps they will outweigh his other legacies." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Louis Byrd, Lynwood's mayor pro tem: "People here, like everywhere, have 
mixed emotions. . . . He was real diplomat, a real American." 
</P>
<P>
 But Byrd and others were also critical of the former President, questioning 
his commitment to civil rights and saying that his domestic agenda did not 
focus on economic development in the African American and other minority 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Nixon is not a hero of black people, poor people or minority people. 
The devastation that is happening to our cities is because of Richard Nixon and 
his policies," said homeless activist Ted Hayes, who was leading a mule-drawn 
replica of the casket that carried King. 
</P>
<P>
 Many at the parade were youths born after Nixon left the White House in 
disgrace in 1974. High school student Christopher Juarez just shrugged his 
shoulders when asked about Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an ex-President. He was an intelligent man," said Juarez, who was 
marching with his Air Force Junior ROTC unit. "He cared about his country. 
That's about all I know."

FROM BEGINNING TO END, NIXON WAS A FIGHTER

<P>
 Richard Nixon's election to the presidency in November, 1968, was the capstone 
to one of the country's most turbulent postwar years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been slain in Memphis, Tenn., and riots swept 
the country. Weeks later, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 North Vietnam's Tet offensive had crystallized political revulsion about the 
war, and Lyndon B. Johnson, in effect, had been driven from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Every month something new set the country on edge. An American spy ship, the 
Pueblo, was captured off North Korea; its crew was thrown into prison. A B-52 
bomber with nuclear weapons aboard crashed in the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats nominated Hubert H. Humphrey amid anarchy in the streets of Chicago, 
and he ran a campaign crippled by Johnson and the war and complicated by the 
angry presence of Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace stealing off with disaffected 
blue-collar voters. 
</P>
<P>
 From this yearlong maelstrom, Nixon emerged with a plurality of 43.4% to 
become one of the most durable and controversial American political leaders of 
the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Never had there been a more astonishing turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the resurrection of a man who had spent six years in political 
purgatory. 
</P>
<P>
 He emerged from the chaos of 1968, political analyst Jules Witcover wrote, 
because his objective was survival: "Through all the year's turbulent events, 
he had not sought enlightenment, not discourse, not public adulation, but 
survival. Over the previous six years, he had been like a soldier in combat 
whose only goal is not to be a daring hero, but to be alive when the battle is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the way it was for Nixon to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who entered politics when anti-communist fervor was at its peak died 
still battling to survive the taint of the Watergate scandal that drove him 
from the White House nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He had taken the public posture of an elder statesman, traveling the world, 
writing and advising his successors, but to the end he was fighting to regain 
his impounded presidential papers and control the tape recordings that had 
helped humiliate him and bring him to the brink of impeachment before he quit. 
It was doggedness and determination that made him a survivor in spite of a 
personality that seemed ill-suited to retail politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was, friends note, basically a shy man, who never really enjoyed meeting 
new people. He detested confrontations with colleagues or disagreements with 
people who worked for him. He preferred to make his decisions in solitude on 
the basis of memoranda written for him rather than haggling over them or 
searching for a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 Try as he did, he could never develop a common touch that put his constituents 
at ease. 
</P>
<P>
 He was said to carefully rehearse little jokes and asides that he wanted to 
use to lighten conversations, but often he still came off as uncomfortable and 
awkward. More than once, he was photographed walking on the beach in shiny, 
leather shoes. He was seen in coat and tie hitting golf shots at his San 
Clemente estate. Once when he stopped to console a motorcycle officer hurt in a 
motorcade accident, his only comment was to ask the suffering man whether he 
liked his job. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never ceased trying to be down to earth. As the Watergate scandal wound 
to a conclusion, he went to Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, where, surrounded by 
country music entertainers, he played with a yo-yo and banged out "Happy 
Birthday" to his wife on a piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Johnson, he was at times maudlin about his humble beginnings and somewhat 
haunted by the glamour, star quality and adoring press coverage that surrounded 
the Kennedys. Even after all of his years in Washington, he was uncomfortable 
with what he regarded as the capital's social and intellectual Establishment 
based in Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
 His feelings were understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Averell Harriman, the New York multimillionaire who served in high 
diplomatic posts in the Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy 
and Johnson administrations, once threatened to walk out of a Georgetown dinner 
party when then-Sen. Nixon arrived and ignored him after the guests were 
seated. 
</P>
<P>
 There were slights, real or imagined, even at the hands of Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. Once asked to describe Nixon's contributions as vice president, 
Eisenhower made his famous offhand remark that he would need some time to think 
of something. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was said to have been hurt on another occasion at an outdoor affair at 
Eisenhower's Gettysburg estate. After it was over, Eisenhower invited his more 
important guests inside, but Nixon was left standing on the lawn. So Nixon 
fashioned himself a political gut fighter from the beginning, and he made 
enemies early -- when he labeled U.S. Rep. Jerry Voorhis a communist dupe, and 
when, in his race for the Senate, he snidely referred to Helen Gahagan Douglas 
as the "pink lady." 
</P>
<P>
 But his fights helped define him as a man of courage. In his famous "Checkers" 
speech in 1952, he saved his place on the Republican ticket. As vice president, 
he courageously faced an anti-American mob in Venezuela and held his own in a 
tit-for-tat "kitchen debate" with Nikita S. Khrushchev in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's election in 1968 completed a long comeback from the ugly and graceless 
-- "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore" -- scene after his loss in the 
1962 California gubernatorial race. That was just two years after he had lost 
to Kennedy in the race for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The astonishing turnaround had seen Nixon leave California for New York, 
considering his political career ended. He had no political base, no 
organization and no prospects. But the assassination of John Kennedy and Barry 
Goldwater's disastrous loss to Johnson in 1964 opened the door once more. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1968 campaign, run with clockwork efficiency and tactical and public 
relations genius, brought Nixon to the White House with an appeal to the 
"silent majority" and with an unexplained plan to end the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, with the Democrats still waging fratricidal conflict, Nixon 
easily won again. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only had he been a fighter, he had been lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 He had smoothly transformed himself from a redbaiter into a tireless advocate 
of international discourse. Fiercely partisan and conservative at home, he was 
politically liberated in foreign policy. Unlike Kennedy and Johnson, he was 
free to make his historic opening to China and to conclude the first strategic 
arms agreement with the Soviet Union without fear of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 But he remained the extraordinary political partisan, a man who seemed to need 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 And he had them aplenty, no matter how successfully he modernized himself on 
issues. More than any other Republican, he was loathed by mainline Democrats, 
who remembered him from his days in Congress, his attacks on Voorhis and 
Douglas and his work on the House Un-American Activities Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 From the day he first captured attention as a biting anti-communist, he was an 
easy mark for caricaturists, with his bushy eyebrows, five o'clock shadow and 
jowls that shook when he delivered an oration. Washington Post cartoonist 
Herblock delighted in drawing Nixon emerging from a sewer; comedians parodied 
his habit of over-dramatizing every development on the horizon, and critics 
kept alive the unshakable appellation Tricky Dick . 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had been vice president for eight years, Nixon, as President, was 
in spirit still an outsider. He surrounded himself with young aides who had 
little political experience and boundless personal loyalty. They shared Nixon's 
perception of patriotism, revulsion about long-haired anti-war demonstrators 
and contempt for officials who leaked stories to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watergate story that unfolded before Congress and in courtrooms in 1973 
was not just the tale of an inept attempt to burglarize the political 
opposition, but the story of Richard Nixon. No one ever in American politics 
had ever traveled such peaks and valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 His imprint was upon some of the great events of his time. But less than six 
years after fighting his way back from oblivion, his Administration was 
disgraced by burglaries being committed, telephones tapped, political enemies 
listed for possible retribution -- and, in the end, the only resignation of an 
American President. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hours after he announced his resignation, Pennsylvania Avenue in front 
of the White House was filled with automobiles, horns honking in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Watergate had become a national pastime. But once Nixon's knowledge of the 
cover-up had become clear, the anger directed at him was deep, deep enough that 
Gerald R. Ford would lose the presidency two years later because he granted 
Nixon a blanket pardon. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 20 years before his death, Nixon waged a last battle to overcome 
the sorry end of his Presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 In some measure, he succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 He assumed the posture of elder statesman, traveling the world and writing on 
foreign policy. He counseled not only Ford, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, but 
also Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 And shortly after his death Friday night, the incumbent called him "a 
statesman who sought to build a structure of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 True. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will always be the first President forced to resign from office, named 
as an unindicted participant in a criminal conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 And he will always be an enigma. He was, Henry A. Kissinger wrote, "a strange 
mixture of calculation, deviousness, idealism, tenderness, tawdriness, courage 
and daring," a man who wanted in the end to be remembered for his idealism.

HARD-LINER IS FAVORED IN EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many of the party faithful, Armando Calderon Sol has decorated his office 
with a large portrait of the late Roberto D'Aubuisson, the cashiered army major 
widely believed to have organized El Salvador's most notorious death squads 
during the last decade of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 With his mentor D'Aubuisson, Calderon Sol founded the Nationalist Republican 
Alliance (Arena party) in 1981 as a bulwark against communism. Today, barring 
major surprises, Calderon Sol will be elected president of El Salvador in a 
runoff that concludes the country's first postwar election. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol, a former mayor of this capital, brings with him his party's 
hard-line history, yet he will preside over a country where leftist former 
guerrillas -- his recent enemies -- for the first time have a legal role in 
government as legislators and mayors. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's voting, the right-wing Calderon Sol, 45, is expected to defeat 
leftist Congressman Ruben Zamora, who leads a coalition made up primarily of 
former guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). 
</P>
<P>
 The victor replaces President Alfredo Cristiani, also of Arena. Cristiani 
represents the modern business faction of Arena that has projected the image of 
a more pragmatic and less extremist party. Calderon Sol, however, has included 
hard-line elements of the party in his inner circle, raising questions about 
the government he will run and its commitment to U.N.-brokered peace accords 
signed by Cristiani. 
</P>
<P>
 The accords ended the war in 1992 and required a host of reforms, including 
the creation of a nonpolitical police force and the overhaul of El Salvador's 
corrupt and inept judiciary. Many of the reforms are still incomplete, and 
opponents fear that Calderon Sol will backtrack on changes seen as crucial to 
building democracy here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real danger is that Arena, with its wide margin of victory, will be 
tempted to impose a one-party system, marginalizing the (opposition) rather 
than working with it," said Christian Democrat businessman Abraham Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol says he supports the peace accords but disagrees with some of the 
measures they require. A U.N.-backed Truth Commission that investigated war 
crimes went too far, he argues, because it blamed most atrocities on government 
forces. And the police, he told reporters, should be professional but should 
also be "feared." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's runoff is required because no candidate obtained an absolute majority 
in March 20 elections. In that contest, Calderon Sol took 49% of the vote to 
Zamora's 25%. Arena and an allied pro-military party won majority control of 
the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The elections had been seen as an important test in El Salvador's struggle to 
recover and rebuild after the war, but widespread irregularities in the March 
20 voting cast a pall over the entire process. Tens of thousands of people were 
prevented from voting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was frightening mismanagement of the election beyond our worst 
expectations," a senior U.N. official said last week. "There was widespread 
lack of trust by the electorate before the voting, (and) now it's much worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The most scathing criticism has been leveled at the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal, which supervises the elections and is dominated by Arena. It refused 
international advice, declined to spend money to transport voters to the polls 
and made voting unnecessarily complicated, U.N. observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (tribunal) is completely discredited and has therefore tarnished the 
election," the U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FMLN claims the irregularities cheated the party out of several municipal 
and legislative seats, and U.N. observers have confirmed that thousands of 
people were denied voting cards in 30 towns where the FMLN is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 The FMLN challenged the results in 37 cities and towns, but the tribunal 
rejected all the claims -- a decision that Rafael Lopez Pintor, who heads the 
U.N. electoral division, called "shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol and other Arena officials say the party has changed in the last 
decade as it has sought to widen its appeal to the political center. They 
describe a well-organized, more moderate party without whose cooperation 
Cristiani could not have forged a peace agreement with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1981, I thought the only way to save El Salvador was to kill all the 
communists," said Ricardo Montenegro, an Arena veteran and vice president of 
the National Assn. of Private Enterprise. "The situation was either we killed 
them or they would kill us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Seventy thousand people have been killed, the country has been destroyed. 
This makes us see things from another perspective. Just killing people does not 
solve things. . . . The people with Calderon Sol have changed, as the majority 
of Salvadorans have changed in the last 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics question just how deep those changes go. D'Aubuisson's name, for 
example, is still invoked in reverent tones at every Arena rally. Diplomats say 
the strongest leverage that can be applied to Arena will be the desire of 
business leaders to continue to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years that have passed since the end of the war, San Salvador has 
experienced a construction boom, and commerce is brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very powerful private sector here that depends on the exports 
market and does not want (the Salvadoran government) to be an international 
pariah," said a diplomat who follows Arena. "Changes in the Arena party are not 
done for altruistic reasons but because it works politically and helps attract 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
 According to secret U.S. government documents declassified last year, Arena's 
paramilitary unit, directed by D'Aubuisson, was responsible for thousands of 
murders and a wave of terrorism through the 1980s. The Truth Commission found 
that D'Aubuisson ordered the 1980 assassination of Roman Catholic Archbishop 
Oscar Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultra-rightist standard-bearer Roberto D'Aubuisson and members of his 
Nationalist Republican Alliance cooperate with and direct some terrorist 
groups," according to one of the documents, a February, 1985, CIA briefing 
paper. "Although we perceive Arena's internal terrorist network to be one 
component of the much broader phenomenon of rightist violence in El Salvador, 
the party's attitudes and goals probably influence extremist perspectives in 
general." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Aubuisson died of throat cancer in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents also report that the 1981 kidnaping of Emilio Charur, president 
of the Salvadoran Soccer Federation, was plotted at Calderon Sol's home. An 
army officer who worked for death squads and is currently in jail in the 
Salvadoran city of Santa Ana claims that Calderon Sol was part of a group of 
young Arena militants who bombed the Ministry of Agriculture and wreaked other 
havoc in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's alleged goal was to destabilize the government at the time, which 
was initiating an agrarian reform that took land from wealthy Salvadorans. 
Calderon Sol has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats, politicians and business leaders point to substantial differences 
between Cristiani and Calderon Sol. A lawyer by profession who made a popular 
mayor, Calderon Sol is seen as a quick-tempered man who lacks Cristiani's 
intellectual and negotiating skills. He relies more on affability than wit and 
has been described as malleable. One businessman tells a story of meeting with 
Calderon Sol three times to discuss a tax, and each time Calderon Sol had a 
different position. 
</P>
<P>
 Such characteristics, analysts say, make those who surround Calderon Sol all 
the more influential. Diplomats say they will be watching closely to see if 
Arena extremists are given Cabinet positions.

YORBA LINDA READIES FINAL RESTING PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Shaw pretty much summed it up for residents here who suddenly find their 
tiny city being thrust into the national spotlight with the death and impending 
funeral of former President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bummed he died. . . . It's pretty sad," said Shaw, 27, who manages a 
Mimi's Cafe several blocks away from where Nixon will be buried this week. "But 
it's kind of electrified the city. It's usually just a one-horse town." 
</P>
<P>
 On the bustling streets of Yorba Linda on Saturday, you could see and feel the 
impact of the former President's death as arrangements gained momentum for 
Wednesday's state funeral at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Police grappled with security and traffic concerns, city officials prepared to 
host scores of dignitaries, flower shop owners hired more delivery drivers and 
restaurant managers ordered more food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this doesn't happen every day in Yorba Linda," said Shaw, who 
had customers lining up outside his cafe door. "This is definitely a busy 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the busiest people were the florists, whose phones rang repeatedly 
with orders from throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a holiday," said Linda Johnson, 28, who works at Yorba Linda 
Flowers. "We've had to order a lot more flowers." She said this week would have 
been extremely busy without the funeral because it is National Secretary's 
Week. "Now, it's overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 Thelma Darwicki, who manages the Accent on Flowers shop on Yorba Linda 
Boulevard, said she has received orders from as far away as Kansas, Oklahoma 
and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting swamped," said Darwicki, 45. When Nixon first became ill, she 
started to prepare for an onslaught of orders. "We were very busy when Pat 
(Nixon) died last year. We're expecting it to be even busier now." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, people stopped by the store to pick up ready-made 
arrangements to place at the steps of the Nixon library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this really impacts a small town," Darwicki said. "It makes 
you feel good to see the outpouring of concern. I'm just glad to be helping 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents said the street closures, parking and traffic problems that 
are sure to occur throughout the week are a small price to pay for having such 
a prestigious institution as the library in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic is no big deal," said Radka Eagan, 71, who lives in an adult 
condominium complex across the street from the library. "We're used to that 
sort of thing. It's no problem at all. I'm happy it's here. It's such a 
beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
 While the city geared up for the dramatic funeral and burial services, 
hundreds of county residents made pilgrimages to the Nixon library to drop off 
flowers, sign a massive condolence card to the Nixon family and pay their final 
respects to a man who, for good and bad, made his mark in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 They gathered throughout the day outside the building, standing in small 
groups on the library's concrete steps and approaching its closed front doors, 
where roses, burning candles, children's drawings and handwritten notes formed 
an ever-growing tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Henry W. Wedaa said he drove by the library Saturday morning just 
to see what was going on and was surprised at the large number of people there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that basically Nixon has been a controversial figure and I really 
think that deep down, a lot of people have a great deal of respect for Nixon," 
Wedaa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Schmidt, a retired aerospace worker who lives a couple blocks from the 
library, agreed. Sitting in his garage and chatting with friends, Schmidt said 
he was "proud" that Yorba Linda is the birthplace of Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he often takes out-of-town visitors to the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very nice place," said Schmidt, 62. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're the final resting place," said Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley. 
Nixon "definitely made good. It's hard to see a favored son come home to rest. 
It closes the circle." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley added that Nixon's death has left many of her city's 57,000 residents 
"saddened. They're affected because he is our father figure here. He really 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Miller of Yorba Linda was talking quietly to her 5-year-old daughter, 
Ali, as they walked down the steps, past a bed of colorful pansies and out 
toward the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to bring her so that maybe she can remember him too," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Amy and Shu Ping Yu, a Walnut couple who emigrated from China in 1979, 
stood side by side before the doors, gratefully remembering the man responsible 
for the historic opening to China in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "We care so much for this man," said Shu Ping Yu, 52, blinking back tears as 
he remembered watching Nixon's motorcade pass by on a Beijing street 22 years 
earlier. "Then, I never thought I could be here. He opened the door for so many 
people, for me. He gave us a brand-new life." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood alternated between one of solemn remembrance and almost carnival-like 
chaos. Onlookers, dressed in everything from running attire to dark suits, 
gathered to stare at television reporters using the library's facade as a 
backdrop for their reports. Children skipped down the steps or rushed past 
adults and other children waiting patiently in long lines to sign condolence 
cards to the Nixon family. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, Robert Cornwell, 41, gazed through a white railing entwined with 
bougainvillea at the tiny clapboard farmhouse where Nixon was born. But unlike 
many of the other visitors, Cornwell admitted to a measure of ambivalence about 
the man he had come to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagreed with the man strongly about many things and really felt betrayed 
by Watergate," Cornwell said. "But I also think he made some very tough, good 
decisions. And that kind of decision-making isn't always the hallmark of 
today's political landscape." 
</P>
<P>
 There were Nixon family members too. Yorba Linda resident Marlyn Marshburn, 
whose husband's aunt was the sister of Nixon's mother, had come with her 
daughter, Lynette Ilertsen, and Ilertsen's daughter, Megan, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilertsen said she had attended Nixon's first Inaugural as a seventh-grader and 
joined other family members for a White House dinner, where Nixon sat at the 
piano and entertained his relatives. "It was just thrilling to be there," she 
said. "We're going to miss him so much." 
</P>
<P>
 At Yorba Linda Friends Church, where Nixon's parents were founding members, 
Pastor John Werhas said the news of his death has struck a deep chord. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be saddened greatly by any loss of anyone, especially a man like 
President Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 The church, located a stone's throw from the Nixon Library & Birthplace, is 
strongly connected to the Nixon legacy, Werhas said. Nixon's father helped 
build the church 85 years ago, and the church facilitated the burial of Pat and 
now Richard Nixon at the library through a land transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is that connection between our church and the President. There will be 
a moment of silence, I'm sure, and prayers for the family," Werhas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Costley, another pastor at the church said no other formal memorial 
services were planned for this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure (the Rev.) Billy Graham will do just fine," Costley said.

UCI EAGER FOR CHANCELLOR TO END SILENCE; EDUCATION: MANY PRAISE HER 
ACCESSIBILITY BUT SAY IT'S TIME FOR HER TO 'STAND UP AND BE COUNTED.' 
</P>

 Less than a year into her tenure as chancellor of UC Irvine, Laurel L. 
Wilkening's task of reshaping the young university in an age of budget cuts, 
faculty buyouts and a shrinking cast of key administrators has been compared to 
those confronted by a mythological hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little like cleaning out the Augean stables," said James Fallon, a 
professor of anatomy and neurobiology at UCI's College of Medicine. "She's 
trying to divert two rivers to clean out what was there and get things moving 
again. I don't envy her at all." 
</P>
<P>
 As her challenges seem to mount -- tuition and fees are up, budget woes 
linger, some key university posts are vacant, the university's growth spurt has 
slowed and campus morale has slumped -- Wilkening has been conspicuously 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
 To Wilkening, it has been more important to listen during her first year than 
make broad pronouncements or act precipitously. "I think it would be arrogant 
and possibly stupid to come in here and say 'UCI, I've got the answer for you. 
Just listen to me. Here's how it is,' " she said. "People would reject that, 
and reasonably." 
</P>
<P>
 But now the pressure is building for Wilkening to act. "There is a general 
feeling among the faculty that the campus is sort of adrift," said R. Duncan 
Luce, distinguished professor of cognitive science and economics and a member 
of the committee that helped select Wilkening. "And it's understandable that 
people feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
 While Luce and many others agreed that Wilkening gets high marks for consensus 
building and accessibility, very soon "she's going to have to stand up and be 
counted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening has given few hints so far of her vision of the university's future. 
But no later than this summer, she faces a series of formidable decisions that 
finally will tip her hand on the direction she hopes to lead the school in 
years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 At immediate issue are recent recommendations from two task forces on how UCI 
can slice an additional $10.8 million from next year's budget, even as it 
struggles to absorb another $13.7 in state funding cuts ordered over the past 
three years. Together, the reductions represent the loss of more than 16% of 
UCI's base budget since 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations, which include eliminating the departments of education 
and physical education and the program in comparative culture, have brought 
howls of protest from those who would be affected and a flurry of anguished 
comments from across the campus and community. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the storm, Wilkening has sought to reassure the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to be this quiet, but I thought it was important to the 
process," Wilkening said in an interview. To speak out prematurely, she said, 
would undermine the broad-based, at times impassioned, discussion that has 
occurred throughout the campus since the task force reports were issued in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 A university committee is now synthesizing the comments from various groups 
and will deliver them to Wilkening by early June. Decisions that would affect 
the 1994-95 budget, including the elimination of departments, must be made 
before the end of June, with the rest likely to be reached during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 17,139 students, 1,028 faculty members and 8,700 employees at UCI, 
that means continuing to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time of great concern on campus," said pharmacology Professor Sue 
Duckles, a former chair of the university's Academic Senate, which represents 
its faculty. "A lot of things are up in the air, and we're going through very 
difficult times, which creates a lot of anxiety about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months since her arrival on campus as UCI's first female chancellor, 
Wilkening, who served as provost of the University of Washington before she was 
selected for the top spot at UCI, has won high marks from faculty, staff and 
students for her accessibility, her listening skills and the quality of her 
interim appointments to a growing list of key administrative openings. 
</P>
<P>
 "She even gave out her e-mail code at a faculty meeting," one professor raved. 
Several also praised her ability to remain calm under tremendous pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time somebody walks into the head position of an institution undergoing 
this kind of stress, the challenge is enormous," said John King, an information 
and computer science professor. "I think she's done a good job. She has not 
been party to any panic behavior and has shown a high degree of equilibrium and 
poise." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilkening's continuing silence on specifics of her goals makes it 
difficult to assess her tenure in any substantive way, several faculty members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has said quite consciously that she is not yet trying to paint her image 
of the university," said Luce. 
</P>
<P>
 The degree of anxiety on campus is evident. Several professors, speaking 
privately, said they even worried about whether the university under 
Wilkening's leadership was likely to remain a major research university. And 
they said they wished she would clarify at least this fundamental aspect of the 
university's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening agreed, at least in part. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I should have said the obvious more often," she mused, seated near an 
open window in her sunny, fifth-floor office. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Wilkening said she has no intention of veering the university 
from its traditional mission as a major research institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people want to hear me say that. People want to know that we're not 
going to become a liberal arts college or something," she said. "It would never 
occur to me that we would do anything but that." 
</P>
<P>
 The chancellor also said she is aware that morale at the university is very 
low, a feeling echoed in interviews across the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would their morale not be bad?" she asked. She pointed to last year's 
across-the-board salary cut, three years without raises, and the layoffs of 140 
staff members since 1992, including 10 announced last month in the closure of 
the UCI printing department. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, about 200 senior faculty members are now eligible to retire under 
the University of California's third voluntary retirement program, prompting 
anxiety among those who remain about even greater workloads, she said. The 
deadline for the current buyout is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future is uncertain," Wilkening said. "If people didn't have low morale, 
I would think they were not tuned in to what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think our opportunities are wonderful here," she argued, praising UCI's 
employees, students and the Orange County community as a whole for being 
supportive during the recent travails. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in Orange County and what could be better in terms of our future? It's 
a very supportive place, a place that's going to grow and a very livable and 
exciting place to be. I think that if people can just take a little bit longer 
view than the last few years, our future is extremely bright." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the coming months, Wilkening also must cope with another challenge: how 
to fill a growing number of critical administrative openings. Among the open 
positions is the post of executive vice chancellor, the university's No. 2 job. 
</P>
<P>
 L. Dennis Smith, who had also served as acting chancellor before Wilkening's 
appointment, resigned the post this spring to become president of the 
University of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the list of vacancies has grown, with the resignations just last week 
of UCI's only two female vice chancellors. M. Anne Spence, whose position in 
charge of academic programs was recently proposed for elimination, quit April 
15 to return to teaching and research. On Wednesday, Kathleen T. Jones, vice 
chancellor for university advancement, announced she was resigning to take a 
similar post at Georgetown University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Other key openings include vice chancellor for research and graduate studies, 
open since last year, and the deans of the medical and engineering schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Walter L. Henry, the powerful head of the medical school who was also vice 
chancellor of health sciences, resigned abruptly in December after Wilkening 
rejected his proposal for dividing his two-tiered position into separate jobs. 
In March, acting on the recommendation of a UCI faculty committee after a 
review, Wilkening ousted engineering dean William A. Sirignano. 
</P>
<P>
 The two departures have come under intense scrutiny as many on campus try to 
glean signs of the chancellor's management style and leadership abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men had held high-profile jobs for many years and had formed strong 
alliances among the faculty and in the community. In both cases, colleagues 
have expressed some concern about the long-term impact of the administrators' 
departures on the two schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some, the changes also indicated that Wilkening is not afraid to show 
leadership and is unlikely to shrink from making the difficult choices that 
await her. 
</P>
<P>
 "A chancellor has to make very tough personnel calls," said King, the 
information and computer science professor. "I'm glad to see that she isn't 
afraid to make these calls and stand by them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Wilson, the university's ombudsman since 1977, said Henry and Sirignano 
were remarkably alike -- strong, forceful, demanding leaders whose views of 
governance may not have jibed with what he called Wilkening's more 
collaborative approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening declined comment on the reasons for Sirignano's removal, saying she 
was prohibited from discussing personnel matters. She said she still did not 
entirely understand why Henry chose to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirignano, who is scheduled to leave his post Sept. 1, expressed bewilderment 
at the time of his removal in March, and declined further comment last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some on campus said they were reluctant even to attempt to assess Wilkening's 
tenure so early on. "She's only been here a little while. She hasn't earned a 
grade yet," said Dr. Stanley van den Noort, chairman of the department of 
neurology. 
</P>
<P>
 But many said they had been impressed even during their initial contacts with 
Wilkening, praising her openness, accessibility, intelligence and an obvious 
desire to listen to the concerns of those at all levels of the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a very open and available person who listens to whoever wants to talk 
to her," said Dr. Frank Meyskens, director of the clinical cancer center. 
"She's a very good communicator and is quite open about wanting to know what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 But in meetings on difficult issues, said Fallon, who chairs the faculty of 
the medical school, she can also be tough. At such times, Wilkening is "a 
give-me-the-numbers, cut the B.S. kind of person, who has no trouble getting to 
the essentials," Fallon said. "And that creates a very positive impression of 
her as a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Student leaders, too, were positive. David Kesselman, president of 
undergraduate student government at UCI, said that while the real tests are 
clearly to come, Wilkening so far appears to be taking student concerns 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Ronan, editor of the New University, the campus newspaper, described 
the change in management style with Wilkening's arrival as "both drastic and 
for the better. She's just a really firm believer in an open, deliberative 
process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year before Wilkening's arrival, Ronan said, he had filed about 30 
requests under the federal Freedom of Information Act in order to obtain 
documents from the university administration. Since then, he has needed to file 
only about seven such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more access to documents now, more access to how decisions are being 
made," Ronan said. "There's a real wind of change blowing through that 
administration building."

SERBS DEFY NATO, ADVANCE ON GORAZDE; BOSNIA: U.N. REFUSES TO APPROVE AIR 
STRIKES DESPITE DAYLONG ASSAULT. THEN, AS DEADLINE FOR PULLBACK NEARS, REBELS 
SHOW SIGNS OF COMPLYING WITH ALLIANCE'S ULTIMATUM. 
</P>

<P>
 Bosnian Serb infantry advanced defiantly on the strangled eastern city of 
Gorazde on Saturday in violation of a NATO ultimatum to end their slaughter of 
civilians or face punishing air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials confirmed that the rebels were still attacking more than 24 
hours after the Western alliance vowed to bomb them unless they halted their 
fire immediately. But the civilian chief of the U.N. peacekeeping mission here 
vetoed a NATO call for air power. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today, the United Nations said that no immediate NATO air strikes had 
been ordered because the Serbs were apparently complying with the ultimatum to 
withdraw from the enclave. But U.N. officials could not confirm full 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Artillery shelling of the bedraggled enclave packed with refugees from the 
3-week-old offensive was reported to have died down around a 2:01 a.m. deadline 
for withdrawal, and a regional official in Gorazde reported by ham radio that 
there were no more tanks visible in the city center. The rebels also allowed a 
U.N. humanitarian aid convoy to enter Gorazde late Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the day Saturday, the nationalist rebels appeared bent on pushing 
the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization to deliver on its threat of 
air attacks -- a move that would enmesh Western governments in the deadly 
Balkan conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb soldiers, backed by heavy artillery, moved deeper into the 
proclaimed withdrawal zone from the north just before noon in what one U.N. 
observer in the enclave described as "blatantly increased aggressive activities 
in the face of the NATO ultimatum." 
</P>
<P>
 They concentrated their firepower on an important weapons complex, seizing at 
least one-third of the vast plant and looting it of munitions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 24 hours after NATO ordered the Serbs to retreat, at least 21 people 
were killed in Gorazde by tank, artillery and machine-gun fire. Even after 
Serbian forces fired tank rounds into the maternity ward of Gorazde's already 
demolished hospital, killing at least three patients, Yasushi Akashi, the 
civilian chief of the peacekeeping mission, refrained from authorizing air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO ultimatum issued Friday demanded that the Serbs stop attacks on 
Gorazde immediately; pull back at least 1.9 miles from the city center by 2:01 
a.m. local time today (5:01 p.m. Saturday PDT), and move heavy weapons outside 
a 12-mile "exclusion zone" by 2:01 a.m. Wednesday (5:01 p.m. PDT Tuesday). NATO 
said that failure to meet these requirements could bring an air attack. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali issued a statement when the 2:01 
a.m. deadline expired, saying he would "immediately authorize the use of air 
strikes to protect the safe area of Gorazde" if the Serbs failed to abide by a 
pullout agreement ratified in Belgrade earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no indication from the U.N. command center here that British Lt. 
Gen. Michael Rose, the commander for Bosnia-based troops, had called for 
punitive action against recalcitrant Serbian gunmen still in the exclusion 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is finally some evidence that the threat of NATO air strikes is having 
an effect and the Bosnian Serbs are beginning to comply" but need "more time to 
pull back," a senior Clinton Administration official said a few hours before 
the expiration of the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations' insistence that the Serbs be given more time to comply 
meant it was unlikely that any air strike would be launched before daybreak 
today at the earliest, another Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials had pushed for air strikes against Serbian targets earlier 
Saturday as it became clear that the rebels were inflicting further casualties 
and destruction on the city designated a U.N. safe area. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Akashi, who was in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade earlier in the 
day, had refused the call for air strikes, instead holding out for 
eleventh-hour signs the rebels have been cowed into compliance. Any attack must 
be approved by both NATO and U.N. mission officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic angrily denounced Akashi for vetoing 
intervention that might have saved lives in Gorazde, where 700 people have been 
killed in the Serbian offensive and 2,000 have been wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not understand why the U.N. on the ground here would not give this 
authorization since they know very well what happened today in Gorazde," 
Silajdzic said, saying he held Akashi and Rose personally responsible for the 
latest civilian deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, the American, British and French governments ordered the 
evacuation of all nonessential personnel and family members from their 
embassies in Belgrade, in fear that any air strikes would provoke retaliation 
against Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb gunmen took nearly 200 U.N. peacekeepers hostage and hampered the 
work of thousands last week after two token NATO air strikes against Serbian 
artillery firing on Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of Gorazde's regional governing council, Esad Ohranovic, said the 
city hospital and a refugee center were targeted again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hospital is almost in ruins. We have no medicine, no blood, no food," he 
said via ham radio. 
</P>
<P>
 He confirmed reports by U.N. officials that Bosnian Serb gunmen were 
concentrating their attacks on the Pobjeda munitions factory within the 
1.9-mile radius of the city center NATO ordered the rebels to withdraw from. 
</P>
<P>
 After raking the arms complex with artillery and machine-gun fire all day, the 
rebels moved about 100 trucks into the factory grounds and began looting 
machinery and munitions stores, one U.N. source confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohranovic said three factory workers were injured when a shell blasted through 
the building they were working in only an hour before the withdrawal deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. mission spokesman Cmdr. Eric Chaperon described the situation in Gorazde 
as "confused" and confirmed that the refugee-packed city center was still under 
heavy artillery fire late Saturday, in open violation of NATO's edict for an 
immediate halt to the Serbian onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the continuing hostilities, a convoy of about 200 U.N. troops from 
Ukraine, France and Norway were deployed to Gorazde late in the evening, 
circling the ravaged city center before taking up positions near the building 
where a handful of U.N. military observers have been hunkered down against the 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller convoy of peacekeepers had tried to reach Gorazde two days earlier 
but was blocked about 18 miles to the north by a crowd of Bosnian Serb women 
and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of badly wounded civilians were awaiting medical evacuation from 
Gorazde, but a reliable cease-fire and some U.N. troops on the ground were 
needed before helicopters could be flown into the desperate pocket.

DANNEMEYER SEES SENATE BID AS VANGUARD OF A REVOLUTION; POLITICS: 
EX-CONGRESSMAN DOGGEDLY ADVOCATES RELIGIOUS RECIPE FOR SOLUTIONS TO NATIONAL 
PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The morning was for prayer and politics, and to many of the Good Friday 
worshipers kneeling before a towering hilltop cross in the chilly coastal fog, 
there is little difference. 
</P>
<P>
 As former congressman William E. Dannemeyer told the nodding listeners, there 
is no such thing as separation of church and state in America. That is a 
perversion of the Constitution committed by atheist national leaders and a 
misguided U.S. Supreme Court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ACLU is working like termites, burrowing into our culture to undermine 
what our Founding Fathers gave us over 200 years ago," the lanky grandfather 
said. "George Washington, the first President of the United States, said, 'Let 
us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without 
religion.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The cross on Mt. Soledad overlooking La Jolla Cove has been a flash point in 
Dannemeyer's fight against religious censorship ever since a judge declared it 
was inappropriate for a public park. But the crowd on this morning numbered 
fewer than 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
 If Dannemeyer was disappointed, though, it did not show. In his second 
consecutive bid for California's Republican U.S. Senate nomination, this time 
seeking the seat held by Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the former seven-term 
congressman from Orange County has come to know small crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one reason his critics have often written his political obituary, 
convinced that his religious-right preachings and anti-homosexual attacks are 
out of step with the electorate. In 1992, even many of his supporters figured 
his career was over when he lost nearly 2 to 1 in a GOP primary against 
appointed U.S. Sen. John Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 "His political positions are so extreme as to make him laughable and 
irrelevant to the debate," said Robert Nelson, an Orange County Republican 
political consultant. "For all of California's other follies, it would be a 
highly unusual circumstance to elect a religious fanatic to statewide office." 
</P>
<P>
 But if there is one thing about the 64-year-old Dannemeyer that all sides will 
agree on, it is his obstinate -- if not obsessive -- commitment to pursue his 
religious recipe for solutions to political problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not stop when his issues become politically unpopular. He does not 
stop when critics laugh him off as a wacky amusement. And he does not even stop 
when friends counsel him to assume the role of a senior conservative statesman 
instead of a recycled Senate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dannemeyer the Rock -- the last honest man," said Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove), a conservative soul mate and supporter. "He is a guy who 
would stand up and speak his mind for the good of the country without being 
worried about being punished by pollsters or in the next election. That gets 
around in the Republican universe." 
</P>
<P>
 The same constancy runs through Dannemeyer's personal life. Dannemeyer at home 
is the stolid and doting head of a traditional suburban family. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Evelyn, have lived in Fullerton since 1957, just a few miles 
from the home in South Gate where Dannemeyer was raised by his German immigrant 
parents. He still attends the same Lutheran church where his two daughters and 
one son -- now the parents of eight Dannemeyer grandchildren -- were baptized. 
And he is financially comfortable today largely because of the rent he still 
collects on local properties he bought about 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "At home, he wasn't the politician that most people know him as; he was our 
dad," said Dannemeyer's son, Bruce, an Orange County attorney. "I think he was 
a good father figure. He clearly was the authority in the family, not in an 
authoritarian way, but by rules lovingly applied. . . . He was very devoted to 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer's major opponent in the June 7 GOP primary is a wealthy Santa 
Barbara congressman, Michael Huffington, who will spend millions more than 
Dannemeyer for campaign consultants and statewide television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Dannemeyer's long-shot effort is a mom-and-pop bandwagon. If 
anything, however, Dannemeyer runs hardest upstream. As he writes in a mission 
statement for his campaign, quoting Gen. George Patton, "In every battle, there 
comes a time when both sides consider themselves beaten. He who then continues 
to attack, wins." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer's reason for running against Huffington is the same one he gave for 
challenging Seymour two years ago. He believes his opponent's socially moderate 
views are morally wrong and they provide voters with little reason to replace a 
politically similar Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer believes his campaign is in the vanguard of a growing spiritual 
revolution in America. If his effort is sometimes a lonely one, he is 
undeterred. Turning to the Bible, he says, is the only way the nation can avert 
disaster and solve its pressing problems of crime, poverty and a shabby 
education system. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no mystery about crime's basic cause," he tells audiences in private 
homes, restaurant banquet rooms and public halls throughout California. "It is 
simply man's rejection of God's laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is sure the spiritual revolution is coming, Dannemeyer believes it 
will be a long-term struggle. After all, he charts the decline in America's 
moral values as starting with a 1947 Supreme Court decision establishing the 
separation of church and state and culminating in the nihilism of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 But he notes a growing acceptance in today's political dialogue that many of 
the nation's problems are traced to a decaying value system and family 
structure. Dannemeyer's supporters say the change is evidence of his political 
acuity and a vindication of his mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were not for people like Bill Dannemeyer, our country would be in way 
worse shape than it is now, and that seems impossible," said Sara Hardman, 
California director of the Christian Coalition, a national organization that 
grew out of Pat Robertson's 1988 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more people like Bill Dannemeyer, who not only have beliefs in the 
people and our country, but are willing to go out there and take the hits -- to 
be called extreme and to be called weird things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In campaign speeches this year, Dannemeyer warns his listeners that the 
dangers they face are far more serious than just ignorance or apathy toward 
religion. He casts the United States as a battleground where Christians are 
under attack by atheist leaders in government, media and business. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over the cross on Mt. Soledad and the fight to allow voluntary 
prayer in schools are examples of the struggle, he said. But, in an interview, 
Dannemeyer also suggests that the followers of cult leader David Koresh in 
Waco, Tex., last year were murdered by government agents partly because of 
their religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that is far-fetched for a government that reflects what our 
Supreme Court has done to our heritage in the last half-century," he said. "I 
believe that the wrong people were in the criminal dock in Waco. I believe the 
(federal) agents were the ones who should have gone on trial there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mafia, to my knowledge, has never killed women and children," he added. 
"Agents of the U.S. government did." 
</P>
<P>
 As one of Washington's most outspoken conservatives during his congressional 
career, Dannemeyer has periodically shocked Beltway insiders with controversial 
remarks. In 1990, Dannemeyer objected to Nelson Mandela's speech to a joint 
session of Congress, saying the South African leader was a terrorist more 
comparable to Willie Horton -- the convicted black murderer who raped a woman 
while on a weekend furlough and was featured in a notorious commercial during 
the 1988 presidential campaign -- than to Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 But his national reputation evolved largely during the 1980s because of his 
role as an outspoken critic of homosexuals and the author of several 
controversial proposals regarding AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman twice sponsored unsuccessful ballot propositions to require 
that state health officials compile names of AIDS carriers and remove them from 
some jobs. He also sparked an outcry when he once suggested that AIDS carriers 
emit contagious spores, a claim he quickly dropped. And in 1989, a House 
colleague called for an ethics investigation of Dannemeyer when he read into 
the Congressional Record a graphic description of gay sex acts. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Dannemeyer authored a book called "Shadow in the Land: 
Homosexuality in America," which examines scientific studies about sexual 
preference as a choice and interprets biblical passages as a condemnation of 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 The book argues that there is a dangerous homosexual movement in the nation 
that is conspiring to destroy religious institutions and ruin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Dannemeyer's critics, including some Republicans, say his 
preoccupation with homosexuality has isolated him in the party. As one 
prominent conservative activist said: "He's respected, everybody likes him, and 
if you get him off the subject of homosexuals, he's a real easygoing guy." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be one reason Dannemeyer has not emphasized the issue during his 
Senate race, focusing instead on family values and economics. As a moral issue, 
Dannemeyer said he still considers homosexuality to be one of the 
"battlegrounds in the cultural war." But he believes there are more pressing 
issues for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Dannemeyer is a target for California's homosexual community, where 
some leaders dismiss him as an extremist and others warn that he is a dangerous 
provocateur. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Ricchiazzi of the Log Cabin Club, a gay Republican organization, said he 
believes Dannemeyer's agenda is actually a calculated effort to raise money 
through fear-mongering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scare tactics is a great way to make money," Ricchiazzi said. "He will not go 
away. He is lacking something in himself and . . . he wants to be the bad boy 
so people will pay attention to him." 
</P>
<P>
 As a congressman, Dannemeyer had his victories, although he acknowledges 
frustration with the inherent difficulties faced by a minority House member. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls fondly the years after President Ronald Reagan's 1980 election as a 
time when conservatives felt that the power to change the world was within 
their grasp. But that feeling was temporary and, later, many of Dannemeyer's 
proposals became more symbolic than influential. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years in a row, Dannemeyer offered an alternative budget package 
that he contends would have eliminated the deficit and cut taxes at the same 
time. He also rose to be the ranking minority member of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, where he was a constant antagonist to the chairman, Rep. 
Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). When the committee debated a landmark clean air 
bill, Dannemeyer proposed an anti-pornography amendment that he described as 
"airwave emission standards." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dannemeyer the Rock continued to battle, and he did succeed on several key 
fronts. He was at the forefront of the fight that reduced funding for the 
National Endowment for the Arts after critics complained that taxpayers should 
not be forced to finance controversial works. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, he also succeeded in passing strict guidelines on dial-a-porn 
services. And he forced a roll call vote on a congressional pay raise -- which 
he opposed -- that was a death knell for the idea. "That doesn't exactly endear 
yourself to your peers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer had enough of his own money at the time that he did not rely on his 
congressional salary. But his regular denunciation of political perks is a 
reflection of the immigrant work ethic he learned during a Depression-era 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 9, Dannemeyer got a job to help the family because his father suffered 
from epilepsy and had been committed to a sanitarium years before. Both of his 
parents were born in Germany and passed through Ellis Island on their way to 
Los Angeles, where they met. Before his illness, Dannemeyer's father was a 
chicken-feed salesman in South Gate. Dannemeyer's mother later raised two 
children on her pay as a cleaning woman. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually put himself through Valparaiso University, a private Lutheran 
college in Indiana, and later graduated from Hastings College of Law in San 
Francisco. He served in the Army during the Korean War as a counterintelligence 
officer in Europe, usually doing background checks on federal employees or 
protecting anti-communist witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 On his return to the United States, he married a Lutheran minister's daughter, 
Evelyn Hoemann. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Dannemeyer's law practice and his real estate investments have 
proved lucrative. His last financial disclosure statements from Congress in 
1992 indicate an income from rental properties of at least $200,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer said he does not yet receive Social Security. But in addition to 
the rental income, he does get two government checks every month -- pensions 
from Congress and the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer began his political career in the state Assembly when he was 
elected as a Democrat from Fullerton in 1962. But he said he has always been a 
conservative, and switched to the Republican Party when Democrats took a 
liberal turn in the 1960s by promoting the welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer served three terms in the Assembly before taking a 10-year 
political hiatus while his children were young. He returned to the Assembly as 
a Republican for one term in 1976, then won election to Congress in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Dannemeyer sacrificed his seat in the House so he could face Seymour 
in the U.S. Senate race. The race lasted just a few months. But, afterward, 
Dannemeyer never really gave up the campaign, maintaining a speaking tour 
before groups throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 For his latest U.S. Senate race, Dannemeyer has fashioned a set of proposals 
addressing the key issues of 1994. Typically, however, the latest package 
includes some that are unconventional, controversial and, most likely, 
politically impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, for example, Dannemeyer proposes armed-citizen patrols to supplement 
the police. Citizens should be trained in the use of weapons, he says, but he 
admits the patrols could lead to the mistaken shooting of innocent victims. 
</P>
<P>
 On prisons, Dannemeyer says the state should study the cost effectiveness of 
housing U.S. criminals in financially strapped Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
 On the environment, Dannemeyer decries the Endangered Species Act's disruption 
of commerce. Quoting an early American forest officer, he wrote, "The object of 
our forest policy is not to preserve the forests . . . but for the making of 
prosperous homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these proposals leave critics shaking their heads. But to his allies, 
he is a lone voice of reason in the political wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been criticized for the manner in which he stands by an issue and his 
persistence in remaining true to that issue, but in my mind, that is what sets 
him apart and that's what motivates him," said Dannemeyer's son, Bruce. "He is 
a role model to see that you can be true to your beliefs and be in politics and 
pursue issues that are important to you because they are important to you, not 
because they will line your pocket." Profile: William E. Dannemeyer

S. AFRICANS DRIVEN APART BY APARTHEID FORGE NEW BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The white folks in this 114-year-old conservative community, a speck on South 
Africa's vast plains, fought back mightily when President Frederik W. de Klerk 
began to dismantle apartheid a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The city fathers closed the swimming pool rather than honor De Klerk's demand 
that it be opened to people from Mzinoni, the impoverished black township next 
door. They imposed a $200 annual fee on Mzinoni residents at the local library, 
dues that whites did not pay. And they refused to remove the signs marking 
separate black and white entrances around town. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with the entire country on the verge of a radical change in the 
racial balance of power, the hard-line whites in this tiny town about 100 miles 
east of Johannesburg are beginning to come around, and blacks are showing a new 
willingness to forgive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are Conservative Party members, but that doesn't make any difference," 
said Johannes Fourie, a white lawyer and town councilman. "We are neighbors 
with the people of Mzinoni." 
</P>
<P>
 In the township, Pat Sibande, a black 36-year-old organizer for the African 
National Congress, stood among the shacks of the 60,000 residents and gazed at 
the edge of Bethal, where 11,000 whites live in tidy middle-class comfort half 
a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to drive whites away," Sibande said. "We can't wipe whites out, 
because how can we live without them? All we want is equal rights. And we don't 
want any more of this nonsense from the past." 
</P>
<P>
 The remarkable story of this nation's transition from white minority rule to, 
simply, majority rule is told in places like Bethal and Mzinoni, where ordinary 
people driven apart by apartheid are now beginning to find each other. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, the Bethal town council -- whose members all belong to a 
right-wing party that has vowed to boycott the elections -- began meeting with 
blacks and ethnic Indians from the race-based townships nearby to draft plans 
to administer the area together after the nation's first all-race elections 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Fourie, who says he hasn't even decided whether to vote, and Mandla 
Khayiyana, a 26-year-old ANC leader who spent most of his life in exile with 
his mother, are co-chairmen of a new local forum, facing each other across the 
long oak conference table at Bethal's City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not used to one another yet," Khayiyana said. "But I think they know 
there's no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourie admits that the town council was forced to sit down with black and 
Indian neighbors because of a law passed in January that ordered the formation 
of joint councils. But he says he's willing to abide by the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the ANC is the government, it will be the government," Fourie said. "And 
in Bethal, we will comply with the laws of the country. I can't say whether I 
like it or not. But we will comply." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandla Khayiyana's mother, Meisie, 43, who is also on the negotiating forum, 
said: "It won't be easy for them to give up their power. And we can see some 
whites are still not happy about coming together with blacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Meisie Khayiyana fled South Africa two decades ago with her son Mandla and her 
husband, an ANC guerrilla, who later died in battle. Returning two years ago, 
she was reunited with her two youngest children, and she now lives in a shack 
without electricity or water. Yet she sees heartening signs of change here. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we shop in town, these people (whites) are not like before," she said. "We 
greet each other now. They are not chasing us out of the stores as they were 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 That change of heart in Bethal has been a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were completely against any negotiations with the township," recalled 
Gert Gouws, 47, a candidate for De Klerk's National Party and director of 
services for the region that includes Bethal. "They had resisted everything, 
and I think they were feeling that they could resist to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point may have been what occurred in the nominally independent 
black homeland of Bophuthatswana last month when armed white right-wingers 
arrived to help prop up the homeland leader, an opponent of South Africa's 
elections. The rightists were driven from the town by army troops, who killed 
three of the khaki-clad invaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the end of the right-wing dream," Gouws said. "I think reality 
struck them, and they started to think about what was possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Mzinoni, which has long been an ANC stronghold, the new atmosphere of 
tolerance is evident these days. The National Party has an office there, and 
four party workers, two of them black, were installing party posters written in 
Zulu at the township entrance the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 The posters and even the office would probably have been burned just a few 
weeks ago. But now there appears to be a genuine commitment to democracy in 
Mzinoni. It's a good thing too. Although the ANC is expected to win the 
elections, the National Party will probably garner enough votes to make De 
Klerk a deputy president and his party a powerful force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a problem with the presence of the Nationalists here," said 
Sibande, the ANC representative. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Party office, a three-room house converted for the campaign, 
welcomes a daily stream of interested Mzinoni residents, about 5,000 of whom 
have taken out membership in the party best known for creating the system of 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black people were scared to admit they supported the National Party in the 
past," said Michael Masangu, the party's representative in the township. "But 
we're working together with whites now." The National Party's list of 
candidates in the region includes whites, blacks, Indians and mixed-race 
Coloreds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of ourselves as human beings," Masangu said. "Being black or white 
doesn't count a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mzinoni, expectations of the new government are high, maybe too high. At 
least half the residents live in tin shacks without water or electricity, and 
few of the roads are paved -- a stark contrast to nearby Bethal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabel Sihlali, 43, who shares a three-room shack with her husband and three 
children, is counting on the ANC's promise of affordable housing. She doesn't 
want to live in Bethal, where she fears that right-wingers might attack her. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'd like to have a big house, like other people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC will need time, perhaps years, to begin addressing the needs of 
Mzinoni and the hundreds of townships like it across the country. And some 
worry that blacks will feel betrayed by political leaders who have made grand 
promises that they cannot keep. 
</P>
<P>
 "People must realize that after the election it won't be heaven on earth," a 
white Bethal councilman said. "The only way they can improve their life is 
through hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Sibande said blacks "will have to give the new government a chance. Maybe, 
with the help of other people, we can deliver the goods." 
</P>
<P>
 In Bethal, many whites fear for themselves and their property. Although Nelson 
Mandela and other black leaders have tried to assure whites that their future 
will be secure in the new South Africa, whites here need only drive to the edge 
of town to see the wide gap between their prosperity and the poverty in 
Mzinoni. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows what to expect, what is waiting for us after next week," said 
Johan Swart, a 40-year-old father of two who runs the Bethal city department 
that controls traffic, fire and medical emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is thinking about next year, when new municipal elections will be held 
and blacks will begin playing a permanent role in hiring and firing city 
employees such as Swart. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to accept that the person who rules the country makes the law. 
And we are a law-abiding society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the National Party fails to win enough seats in the province next week, 
Gert Gouws knows that he'll be looking for a new job. But he figures it is 
worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not be the end of the world the day after the election," said Gouws, 
a father of three. "We will finally have a government that has legitimacy. That 
was the thing hurting us all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he added, "even if the ANC wins, I'm confident they have a lot of leaders 
of a very high caliber."

BERNSON'S SPENDING IN '92-'93 FOLLOWS PATTERN; POLITICS: COUNCILMAN'S RECENT 
USE OF FUNDS WAS SIMILAR TO 1991, WHICH WAS CRITICIZED BY THE ETHICS 
COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past two years, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson spent political 
contributions on expensive meals, gifts and tickets to sporting events and 
concerts -- a pattern of expenditures similar to those for which he was harshly 
criticized earlier this month by an Ethics Commission audit of his spending in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A review by The Times of spending records for 1992 and 1993 shows that the San 
Fernando Valley lawmaker spent more than $110,000 in privately solicited funds 
from an "officeholder" account that state law requires be used exclusively for 
governmental, legislative and political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the documents Bernson signed and filed listing his expenditures provide no 
explanation of how many of the purchases are related to government work, with 
some described only as "gifts" or "season tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 The records do not indicate a violation of the state's campaign disclosure 
laws but show a pattern similar to the 1991 expenditures questioned by the 
Ethics Commission in a sharply critical audit released earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson strongly defended his reporting practices, saying all expenditures 
from his officeholder account are used to improve ties with constituents and to 
reward volunteers and staff -- uses he said are justified. He said his 
record-keeping of his spending meets state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very comfortable by the way I use" the account, he said in an 
interview Friday. "It's very appropriate, in fact, a lot more appropriate than 
some other elected officials who shall remain nameless." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said he insists on paying for the dinners, gifts and tickets for 
supporters, constituents and lobbyists to eliminate any appearance that he is 
obligated to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never allowed lobbyists and other people who talk to me about things 
to buy my meals or my lunches or my breakfast or anything like that," he said. 
"I always pay my own way." 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics Commission officials have cited spending reports such as those filed by 
Bernson for 1991 as an example of why the city needs to adopt tougher 
disclosure laws to force officials to provide more details to justify their 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics Commission Executive Director Benjamin Bycel said current disclosure 
laws are so vague that elected officials can justify a wide range of expenses 
without showing how an expenditure is related to legitimate governmental or 
political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules and regulations need to be spelled out so we can't have situations 
where an officeholder can (spend and) simply put down 'political purposes' or 
'governmental purposes,' " Bycel said. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, Bycel has proposed changes in the city's campaign disclosure 
laws to require more detail to justify each expenditure. A hearing is expected 
in the next few months before the council's Rules and Elections Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethics Commission routinely reviews spending reports such as Bernson's, 
but has not yet done so for 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Officeholder accounts were created as part of a landmark ethics package 
adopted in 1990 after a conflict-of-interest scandal surrounding then-Mayor Tom 
Bradley. The account was considered a compromise, balancing a new provision 
prohibiting council members from year-round campaign fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 In an audit of six accounts controlled by Bernson in 1991, including the 
officeholder account, the commission earlier this month criticized 69 
expenditures totaling $30,905 that auditors said lacked documentation 
demonstrating that they were related to government purposes. Those expenditures 
included dozens of expensive meals, gifts, and sports and entertainment 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to lack of supporting documentation . . . auditors questioned whether the 
expenditures were made for a legislative or governmental purpose," the audit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such audits do not recommend disciplinary actions. But the findings were 
passed on to the Ethics Commission's enforcement arm, the city attorney and the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, Bernson has closed all but one account -- his officeholder 
account. From that account he has purchased expensive meals, season tickets to 
Dodgers baseball games and the Hollywood Bowl, and gifts from department 
stores, specialty shops and liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson declined to discuss specific expenditures, but said the baseball and 
concert tickets are usually given to volunteers and staff members as rewards 
for helping on particular projects. He said he buys many gifts because he is 
often invited to parties and celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get invited to every bar mitzvah, every wedding. . . . What are you 
supposed to do? Pay for it personally?" he said. "When we send a gift for 
something like that, it is something strictly related to my office." 
</P>
<P>
 Most notable among Bernson's payments over the past two years was $12,834 he 
spent on 55 dinners and lunches he described simply as meals "with 
constituents." Only five of the 55 meals where purchased in restaurants within 
his district. On average, the meals cost $233 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson spent another $3,428 on what he described in his spending records 
simply as "gifts," "sundry gifts," or "reimbursement for gifts." The single 
biggest expenditure for such gifts was for $1,478 he spent at Northridge Hills 
Liquor for what was described as "Christmas gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson was not the biggest spender of officeholder account money in the past 
two years, according to a Times review of records. The top spender was 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose officeholder account spending topped out at 
nearly $159,000 over the two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bernson is not the only elected city official to use officeholder money 
for expensive meals, tickets to sporting events and travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Yaroslavsky and Mike Hernandez each spent $357 on Super Bowl 
tickets in 1992 and Councilman John Ferraro spent $1,128 on World Cup Soccer 
tickets last year. Several elected officials spent between $100 and $300 on 
individual restaurant meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the Ethics Commission's criticism, Bernson's spending records 
provide an unique glimpse into the lawmaker's dining, travel and spending 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, Bernson collected $66,921 in contributions and spent 
$110,303, according to his records. At the end of his two years, he had a 
balance of $27,319 in his officeholder account. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent $7,288 on travel, meals and accommodations for trips to Italy, France 
and Washington to attend planning seminars and political gatherings. Another 
$5,800 was spent on donations to nonprofit organizations, hospital funds and 
temples. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson also spent $9,646 on season tickets to Dodgers games and the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the single largest category of spending was for meals "with constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 According to his spending records, Bernson favored such pricey restaurants as 
Moonlight Tango in Sherman Oaks, Peppone's in Brentwood, Spago's in West 
Hollywood and Vitello's Italian Restaurant in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 His largest restaurant expenditure was the $737 he spent at the Hollywood Bowl 
in the second half of 1992. The spending report describes it as "dinner with 
constituent," but does not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the records say all meals were with constituents, Bernson said some 
of the meals were with lobbyists and supporters to discuss city business. Some 
of the payments were for the meals of large groups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he is not stingy when he offers to pay for meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody invites you out to dinner, in most cases, when you are going to 
be using your funds, they are not going to invite you to Coco's or to Carl's 
Jr.," he said. "They are going to say, 'Why don't you meet me at Peppone's or 
The Bistro.' " Spending by Elected City Officials 
</P>
<P>
 How city officials spend from their "officerholder accounts," which are funded 
by privately solicited funds and is to be spent for governmental, legislative 
and political purposes associated with city work: 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's Officeholder Account Spending 1992-1993 
</P>

 Some of the largest categories of spending were: Meals: $12,834 Sports and 
concert tickets: $9,646 Travel: $7,288 Donations: $5,800 Gifts: $3,428 Travel

<P>
 This is a story of people who made a world in their image and of how it came 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Their world is a self-contained planet in a bottle outside Tucson called 
Biosphere 2 -- an ambitious ecology experiment that draws 250,000 tourists 
every year to browse past its souvenir stands, admire its architecture and gawk 
at its sculptures constructed of scrap metal recycled from nuclear weapons 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 A harsh struggle for control of this artificial Earth has torn apart the 
secretive community of engineers, eco-warriors and money men that worked to 
raise a $150-million monument in the desert to their vision of a better life 
under glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Biosphere project is in temporary receivership. One founder was 
hospitalized for stress; another has been indicted on charges she sabotaged the 
Biosphere she once inhabited. A third -- Edward P. Bass, the Texas 
multimillionaire who bankrolled the test-tube Earth -- is prepared to face off 
in federal court next month to cement his authority over the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs is a cautionary fable of free-wheeling finance and the private 
enterprise of science. 
</P>
<P>
 To the outside world, the people of the Biosphere crafted a public image of 
cheery environmental activists, dressed like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in 
matching jumpsuits, intent on building the ark that they thought would help 
establish humanity on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 But private letters, diaries, faxes, internal memos and court papers reveal 
deep organizational tensions, fractious internal disputes, and mutual 
suspicions that have been building since the Biosphere was completed in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of the Biosphere, documents show, is one in which the inquiries of 
outside scientists conducting peer review were seen as slander, routine 
committee meetings were taken as evidence of a conspiratorial cabal, and even a 
simple internal business audit was considered a grab for power. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the environmental visionaries came up hard against an eccentric 
businessman whose funds may have seemed inexhaustible but whose patience was 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Bass obtained a court order to formally oust the key 
managers of the Biosphere and seize the premises. He also formally dissolved 
the partnership between the project's financial arm, which he controls, and its 
management team, including founders John Allen and Margret Augustine. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Allen called the situation "the biggest scandal in science I 
know of." 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass, through a spokeswoman, has turned down requests for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "His lawyers have advised him not to make any comment until the court case is 
completed," said Terrell Lamb, his media consultant, in a formal statement on 
behalf of the Bass organization. "The fundamental problem with the management 
of Space Biospheres Ventures was that Ed Bass was persistently lied to." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ousted employees and others involved in running the Biosphere made 
available copies of corporate minutes, internal memos, chapters of unpublished 
manuscripts, a videotape and correspondence that help shed new light on how the 
experiment was run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Biosphere 2 project, operated formally by a company called Space 
Biospheres Ventures run by Bass, Augustine and Allen, was a volatile blend of 
New Age idealism and corporate sophistication. Biosphere 1, in their view, is 
the planet Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 It started as a shared fantasy in an avant-garde theater troupe of 
environmental zealots and trust-fund hippies on a Santa Fe ranch in the early 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Bass, the second son of the Ft. Worth Bass family, which has amassed 
holdings worth several billion dollars. There was Allen, the restless son of an 
Oklahoma farmer, who harbored a store of visionary ideas on how to save the 
environment or, at least -- through Space Age arks such as the Biosphere -- 
survive its destruction. They hoped that such self-supporting enclaves could 
become the model for a colony on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bass providing the bankroll, Allen, Augustine and others in the troupe 
built an empire of hotels, ranches and ecologically oriented companies over the 
next 15 years in a network of holdings stretching from Ft. Worth to Nepal, 
knitted together through about 40 corporate and legal entities. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1986, they were still staging plays at the Theater of All 
Possibilities in Ft. Worth, with Bass acting the role of what one reviewer 
called a "mogul of illusion" in a science fiction drama Allen wrote under a 
pseudonym. 
</P>
<P>
 To build the Biosphere, the group married the romantic rhetoric of spaceflight 
and the set design of "Star Trek" to the humble hoe-and-compost-heap technology 
of waste recycling. From the beginning, they intended that the Biosphere should 
be a money-making venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Biosphere's outward appearance belies its internal turmoil. The 
three-acre terrarium by the Santa Catalina Mountains contains a rain forest, a 
desert and a tiny ocean as well as 3,800 species of plants and animals that 
nourish one another in what its owners like to call the largest self-sustaining 
ecosystem ever built (except Earth, of course). They decorated the grounds with 
their own brand of sculpture -- metal icons of nuclear terror. There are plans 
for a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 As they assembled its foundations during the 1980s, the group was dogged by 
bizarre published reports that Allen, a man some described as a "poetic 
pussycat," was a cult leader who routinely tongue-lashed Bass, on occasion hit 
him and psychologically coerced him into funding projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have denied the more lurid stories, blaming disgruntled employees for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories were enough, however, to prompt Allen to formally resign his post 
in 1985 as a consultant to Decisions Team Ltd., one of the holding companies 
overseeing the Biosphere. Allen stayed on as vice president of biospherics at 
Space Ventures until earlier this month, when he resigned to protest Bass' 
court action. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent affidavit, Bass sought a temporary restraining order barring Allen 
and others from the Biosphere because "based on my past experiences, such 
persons have demonstrated the capability to react irrationally or 
destructively. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Bass, 48, is described by associates as something of a loner who used to spend 
half of every year on a 500,000-acre ranch in Australia. He now rarely gets 
farther than Ft. Worth. He donated $20 million to Yale University, his alma 
mater, to study the environment and the ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 He has never given a detailed explanation of his reasons for investing in the 
Biosphere project, but to a man whose family has made several billion dollars 
on investments in Walt Disney Co., the idea of an ecological theme park along 
the lines of Epcot or Sea World seemed reasonable. Until recently, the Basses 
owned a 24.9% share of Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written response to a reporter's query several years ago about the theme 
park aspects of the Biosphere, Bass said: "As to the accusatory claims that 
this is Disneyland, it certainly is. . . . It would be a waste to be doing this 
without giving a means for people to access it. Besides, (tourism) is a 
significant source of revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent turmoil was presaged by a widely publicized dispute last year 
that resulted in the resignations of the Biosphere's independent Science 
Advisory Committee (SAC). 
</P>
<P>
 That disagreement centered on questions of scientific standards, just as the 
more recent fight revolved around questions of financial standards. The 
disputes, observers say, show how the managers responded to criticism by 
working to limit outside scrutiny and how pervasive their distrust of Bass was 
becoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of eminent scientists that made up the committee, which was chaired 
by Thomas E. Lovejoy, a senior official at the Smithsonian Institution, had 
been recruited in 1992 to bolster the project's scientific credibility. Lovejoy 
is the assistant secretary for external affairs at the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members have repeatedly declined to detail their reasons for leaving 
the project. Several still work as Biosphere consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously unpublished letters between Bass and Lovejoy last year reveal the 
degree to which the dispute centered on the board's objections to the way Allen 
and Augustine ran the Biosphere, citing concerns that the data was unreliable 
and "a pattern on the part of Biosphere 2 staff of withholding information and 
lying." 
</P>
<P>
 The board was created after the project's combination of serious science and 
theme park commercialism earned hoots and hosannas in equal measure from 
mainstream scientists. Its scientific achievements were tainted by what many 
critics saw as evidence of duplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious complaints involved allegations concerning the fundamental 
honesty of the Biosphere experiment, in which the test tube itself was one of 
the unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Project managers had vowed that the Biosphere would be self-supporting during 
its first two-year experimental run, from 1991 to 1993, growing its own food, 
generating its own air and recycling all its wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the first eight-member crew was sealed inside Sept. 26, 1991, 
however, reports quickly surfaced that they were living on stored food supplies 
and that they were replenishing the inside atmosphere with extra oxygen. 
Unknown to the public at the time, a carbon dioxide scrubber had also been 
installed to eliminate harmful build-up of dangerous gases. 
</P>
<P>
 The project managers considered expelling one crew member from the Biosphere 
for revealing the existence of the food stores, documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 As problems and criticism mounted, the people running the project retreated 
into a defensive shell -- the emotional equivalent of the Biosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 By January, 1993, the science advisers, anxious to ensure the reliability of 
the data the Biosphere was producing and restore its credibility, had decided 
that Allen, Augustine and other local managers were a fundamental part of the 
problem, not part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are making mistakes and they don't even know they are making them," one 
committee member says on a videotape of an informal meeting in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When one employee took his complaints directly to the scientists, Bass 
complained to Lovejoy that the committee "seems to have become a lightning rod 
for not only legitimate matters, but also for complaints and grievances of all 
sorts. Frankly I cannot distinguish the truth amongst the muddle." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen criticized the science committee as a "hit team from the Establishment" 
orchestrated by Bass, according to an unpublished diary kept by one employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Nelson, a founding member of the team who spent two years inside the 
Biosphere, said in a recent interview that the committee had nothing to do with 
research and "totally to do with discrediting the management in an attempt to 
take over the corporation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass defended the managers, however, the 1993 letters show. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has been increasingly difficult is the insistence . . . that I remove 
Margret Augustine and John Allen from their management positions with the 
corporation," Bass wrote to Lovejoy. "To take your advice literally would 
almost certainly shut down the project and jeopardize its entire future." 
</P>
<P>
 In a second letter he wrote, "I certainly never intended the committee to 
involve itself in matters far afield from science relating to the management of 
a privately held and highly diverse business." Bass said the committee's 
inquiry was "very questionable ethically." 
</P>
<P>
 The project managers were so upset about the committee's inquiry that before 
the committee had a chance to determine whether any of the allegations were 
true, they persuaded Bass to order Lovejoy and board members to stop talking to 
each other except when formally convened by the Biospherians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Science does not work that way," Lovejoy responded bluntly in a letter to the 
financier and submitted his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1993, the senior managers voted to dissolve the science 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a year would pass before Bass would move to dismiss Augustine and Allen 
under conditions that Nelson would call an eerie replay of the dispute over the 
science committee. Again, outside scrutiny would trigger a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Biosphere 2 project skirted the edge of scientific respectability, the 
managers found that profits also were elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though conceived as a profit-producing venture, Biosphere 2 has yet to make a 
profit, and is currently requiring substantial cash funding," Bass said in an 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior managers were looking for someone to buy the Biosphere -- the asking 
price for an equity share was to be $300 million -- and several of the original 
Biosphere crew were suing for payment of back salaries. The senior managers and 
Bass spent hours in board meetings discussing plans to put the project on a 
sounder footing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bass tried to install Beverly Hills investment banker Stephen K. Bannon 
as an interim chief executive officer, Augustine would not let him on the 
property and told employees not to talk to him, according to Bass' affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Bass tried to check the company's financial records, the managers 
would not let the auditor talk to employees and would not let him see the 
accounting records, court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bass commissioned an outside auditing firm to check the accounts, Allen, 
Augustine, Nelson and other senior managers voted March 28 to suspend the 
audit, corporate minutes show. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors "were going to kill the management there and finish the job the 
SAC had failed to do," Allen said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, Bass was in federal court in Ft. Worth to end the 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day -- April Fool's Day -- Allen, Nelson, Augustine (who checked out 
of the hospital last week) and the others were officially barred from the 
Biosphere they had built. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them -- Abigail Alling and Mark Van Thillo, who had spent two years 
inside the Biosphere as part of the first crew -- were arrested for opening the 
sealed enclosure to let in outside air. On Thursday, a grand jury in Arizona 
dropped the charges against Van Thillo, but formally indicted Alling. If 
convicted, she faces up to 22 months in prison and a $150,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I think has happened so far is in the best interests of the project," 
Linda Leigh, co-captain of the crew that spent two years in the Biosphere, said 
in an interview. "I'm really behind Ed Bass 100%." Charting Biosphere 2 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some key dates in the Biosphere 2 project:

</P>
<P>
 * January, 1993: Oxygen is pumped into the project after level drops too low.

</P>
<P>
 * April 6: Two members of Biosphere's first crew, Abigail Alling and Mark Van

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; ISOLATED TOWN PROTESTS MOLESTER IN ITS MIDST; PLACEMENT OF 
THOMAS HETHERINGTON ANGERS MANY RESIDENTS OF TINY SALTON SEA COMMUNITY. BUT 
WILSON WILL NOT ORDER HIS RELOCATION BECAUSE THE CONVICT 'HAS TO GO SOMEWHERE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Wright, wife of a Baptist minister, doubts that even Jesus Christ 
would think that paroled child molester Thomas Max Hetherington belongs here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lord loved everyone, but he knew that some people who are confirmed 
evildoers must be separated from society for the protection of others," Wright 
said. "That's how Bombay Beach feels about Mr. Hetherington." 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Corrections officials might have thought they were 
separating Hetherington from society by paroling him to this tiny, isolated 
Salton Sea community with the improbable name. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead they provoked another community into anger about having to accept 
a molester from somewhere else into its midst. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hetherington, 78, a retired construction worker, was released from state 
prison in San Luis Obispo two weeks ago after serving 11 years of a 21-year 
sentence for repeatedly molesting eight girls in rural Ramona north of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 When three victims invoked their right to prevent him from being paroled 
within 35 miles of them, officials were forced to scrap a plan to parole 
Hetherington in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of indecision, parole agents installed Hetherington in the B-B 
Motel in Bombay Beach. He was ordered to wear an electronic anklet, call his 
parole agent before he leaves his $450-a-month room and keep 100 yards away 
from children. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200 or so residents of Bombay Beach -- many of them low-income pensioners 
and struggling families on the lip of poverty -- were not consulted. In 
announcing that Hetherington would not be allowed near San Diego, officials 
declined to disclose where he was being sent. 
</P>
<P>
 Hetherington's whereabouts and sordid past quickly became public when a 
reporter learned that he had registered as a sex offender with the Imperial 
County Sheriff's Department. The response in Bombay Beach was volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 residents packed the community meeting hall last week to berate 
corrections officials on their choice. Dozens of phone calls were placed to 
legislators, who could only respond feebly that Gov. Pete Wilson alone could 
override the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel every child on this beach is in danger while this monster is here," 
said Anita Flores, who has a 10-year-old daughter. "We shouldn't have to live 
in fear because of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections official Art Lucero said Bombay Beach was chosen because it 
provides medical services (a paramedic unit), has few children and is within 
driving range of San Diego if Hetherington's relatives want to visit him. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter where we put him, somebody is going to complain," Lucero said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man with saggy features and a gait slowed by a heart ailment, Hetherington 
came to the door of his room to tell reporters that he just wants a chance to 
live in peace. An offhand remark that he would like to attend church only added 
to the furor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. John Wright announced that Hetherington will not be allowed in 
Seaside Baptist Church, the community's only church. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as we, as Christians, want Mr. Hetherington to be right with the 
Lord, we know parents in our congregation who won't let their children attend 
if someone like him is with us," Barbara Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Squeezed between the desert and the smelly waters of the Salton Sea, Bombay 
Beach is a collection of trailers and small homes set amid a dozen irregularly 
spaced and gravel-strewn streets. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sea's ecological fortunes plunged, so too did Bombay Beach's hopes of 
becoming a resort community. Stores are closed, lots are undeveloped and the 
marina is only semi-active. 
</P>
<P>
 Bombay Beach is so bleak that Michael Jackson used it as a backdrop for the 
"Out of the Closet" video that accompanied his song "Dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Located on the sea's barren north shore, Bombay Beach is said by residents to 
have gotten its name in the 1920s from a world traveler who compared its 
breezes to those of Bombay, India. In the summer, the temperature breaks 100 by 
midmorning and keeps going. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of Hetherington thrust the desert community into the center of one 
of the political season's hottest issues: What should become of sex offenders 
once they have served their sentences. Starting with his decision to parole a 
Bay Area rapist to remote Modoc County, the governor has been put on the 
defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Like residents of Modoc County, the residents of Bombay Beach say they cannot 
understand why they should have to accommodate a sex offender from another 
area. The community grocer said Hetherington is not welcome in his store. A 
handful of protesters Saturday picketed the B-B Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got him because we don't have enough voices to scream loud enough," 
resident Petre Melvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, attending a reelection fund-raiser Saturday night at a golf course 
outside El Centro, was met with questions about Bombay Beach. Imperial County 
Supervisor Brad Luckey implored him to move Hetherington elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sympathetic to the residents of Bombay Beach," Wilson responded, but 
added he would not order relocation because "Hetherington has to go somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 There also are those in Bombay Beach who say Hetherington should be left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's 78 and he's tied down real good," Joe Huckeba said. "What harm can he 
do?"

ON CALIFORNIA: ANOTHER KIND OF NATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes it must be difficult for Americans to accept that Richard Nixon was 
a native son of California. He was a man who wore a suit to the beach. He was a 
candidate whose handlers would force him to take 15 minutes of sun each day to 
develop at least the pretense of a tan. His personal orbit did not intersect 
with Hollywood people. Being hugged by Sammy Davis Jr. on stage was Nixon's big 
moment in the celebrity whirl. 
</P>
<P>
 His demeanor, too, hardly seemed to fit the standard perception of California 
attitude. Richard Nixon was not laid-back. He did not go with the flow. 
Bitterness could spill from the man. He carried grudges, chewed sour grapes. He 
brooded. He battled. To those who would ask rhetorically of Nixon, "Would you 
buy a used car from this man?" the answer should have been: Hell, yes. . . . It 
happens every hour on car lots across L.A. Had it been his calling, Nixon could 
have moved a lot of iron. He had the skin for it. He had the hustle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon never presented himself as a golden son. In his last years, he traded in 
San Clemente for New Jersey. He did not seem steeped in California lore, did 
not rhapsodize about this place in the special, lyrical way of many California 
politicians. He wrote in his memoirs that his 1962 run at the governorship was 
a reluctant one, a reluctance rooted in a concern that California was too 
"parochial." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, he was born right here -- "in a house," his memoirs begin, "my father 
built." He was raised here and later in Whittier. He went to school around 
here, practiced law, met, married and much later buried his wife here. And in a 
way that many people -- maybe even Nixon himself -- might miss, he was 
quintessentially Californian. He simply belonged to a type of Californian that 
is as overlooked as it is common. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most Californians don't live by the beach. The beach might have been where 
their people were headed when they set out long ago, from Oklahoma or Missouri 
or, as in Nixon's case, Ohio and Indiana. But they didn't quite make it. 
Instead, they settled in the interior, in towns like Bakersfield or Poway or 
Brea or Yorba Linda. More than California's coastal communities, these towns 
tend to differ drastically in their fabric and feel -- depending on which 
immigrant tribe happened to pitch camp there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1900s, Nixon's father had been persuaded that citrus was the new 
California gold. The flyers that attracted dreamers from all over had described 
Yorba Linda as a place where "the soil is a deep, rich loam," with plenty of 
rainfall and "frostless." The day Nixon was born the groves were all freezing. 
The lemon trees his father planted never took in the bad dirt. Oil strikes, 
which became a sort of fallback aspiration for those who failed in farming, 
never materialized on the Nixon property. 
</P>
<P>
 In a biography, Roger Morris described how Nixon would return sometimes to the 
failed groves of his father. "The rancher was a liar," he would tell his old 
neighbors again and again. They weren't quite sure what he meant, but his 
bitterness was easy to read. 
</P>
<P>
 The family moved on to Whittier, where Frank Nixon, the father, ran a gas 
station and grocery store. To young Nixon fell the task of stocking the 
vegetable bins, a job he was said to have detested. On either side of the Nixon 
acre sat the large, prosperous ranches of the Leffingwells and Murphys. Streets 
were named after such grand families. Stories were told about the exploits of 
their children. Nixon noticed this, and as one of his mentors would later tell 
a historian, it "had a profound effect. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Again, none of this is exceptional by California standards. For every movie 
star, there are whole markets of Californians who must pay their $7 to see the 
show. For every poem about the California promised land, there are millions of 
prose lives being lived out in the middle somewhere. For every Californian who 
catches the dream ride, there are so many, many more who miss out. Some become 
bitter, disappointed. Some become overachievers, hustlers. Some become a bit of 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 As everyone knows, Nixon got busy and went places and reached too far. And now 
it is more than a little ironic that he will be buried in the same sandy ground 
that so failed his father. On Saturday, the visitors kept coming to the 
handsome presidential museum and library that have been built around Frank 
Nixon's white bungalow. They had come to sniff history, to tell their Nixon 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman volunteered how Nixon once had autographed a baseball for her. A man 
described how one time he thought he was passed by Nixon's limo on the road: "I 
honked, and I think he waved." Many visitors were from out of state, and 
everyone seemed to agree that the Nixon grave was destined to become quite a 
tourist attraction. In the end, what could be more Californian than that?

UNZ TV AD SAYS WILSON FAILED L.A. DURING RIOTS; POLITICS: GOVERNOR CALLS HIS 
OPPONENT'S CHARGES 'COMPLETELY WRONG AND A NEW LOW IN THIS CAMPAIGN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his sharpest critique of Gov. Pete Wilson to date, Republican gubernatorial 
challenger Ron Unz has unveiled a television ad that says Wilson completely 
failed Los Angeles during the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "He let the National Guard sit on its hands as mobs of criminals burned and 
looted my native city for days. That's leadership?" asks Unz, a 32-year-old 
Silicon Valley entrepreneur who grew up in North Hollywood. Unz then questions 
the value of "Wilson's election year crime summit -- getting together with a 
bunch of other politicians to talk about crime? Did that make the streets any 
safer?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-second spot, which began airing statewide Saturday, is Unz's third 
foray into television (he has also broadcast two radio ads around the state). 
In other ads, he has berated Wilson for his handling of the economy, public 
education and the "three strikes" law. But the latest ad, which features 
footage of Los Angeles in flames, is by far the most biting. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's reelection campaign has consistently downplayed the importance of 
Unz's bid, which so far is being financed with more than $1 million of Unz's 
own money. But Friday, the governor's campaign responded for the first time to 
Unz's criticisms, issuing a three-page news release that calls the latest ad 
"completely wrong and a new low in this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 "Governor Wilson offered Los Angeles the National Guard before they even asked 
for it. . . . Whether it's rebuilding a freeway fast or getting the Guard on 
the street, Pete Wilson is the man for a crisis," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 It continued: "The Crime Summit did indeed make our streets safer. It directly 
led to passage of the 'three strikes (and) you're out' law that puts repeat 
violent felons away for life." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that questions have been raised about the National 
Guard's deployment during the riots. On the evening of April 29, just hours 
after the rioting began, Wilson ordered the Guard to deploy 2,000 troops to Los 
Angeles, and soldiers were quickly assembled. 
</P>
<P>
 But the troops were unable to move into assignments because of a series of 
problems, the most notable being that their ammunition did not arrive until 2 
p.m. the next day. Wilson was critical of the delays -- in the wake of the 
civil unrest, he ordered an investigation that found that top Guard officials 
were mostly to blame for the snafus. Eventually, Wilson replaced the head of 
the California National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Unz, whose platform is "smaller government, lower taxes, fewer regulations 
and traditional values," said he believes that the governor was responsible. 
The Wilson campaign's responses only made him more adamant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson is commander in chief of the National Guard. . . . He can blame 
others, but the buck stops at the top," Unz said in an interview. "I watched my 
city burn. . . . That is something I'll never forgive Pete Wilson for. I don't 
regard it as a low blow. I regard it as the height of cynicism for him to 
campaign on the crime issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Unz mentioned Spike Lee's 1989 movie "Do the Right Thing" and added: "After I 
saw that movie and heard all the rap songs promising to burn down Korean stores 
and after all the publicity surrounding the Rodney King (beating) trial, I was 
certain that the level of ethnic tension meant there could be riots. . . . As 
governor, I certainly would have taken that into account and had some 
preparation on hand." 
</P>
<P>
 On the "three strikes" law, Unz said: "Mike Reynolds is the person behind 
"three strikes and you're out." Reynolds and his wife spent their life savings 
to get it on the ballot, and then Wilson jumped on the bandwagon. . . . Wilson 
is a fraud. He's going to drag the Republican Party down with him unless we get 
rid of him now." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of Unz's media blitz is as yet unmeasured. Unz said his campaign 
will soon conduct polling to assess whether he is luring voters away from 
Wilson. But political observers predict that Unz, while he will probably appeal 
to conservative Republicans, will get only limited mileage out of continued 
attacks on Wilson.

RATTLED BY REPTILES; AS SNAKES STIR IN SPRING'S WARMTH, PEOPLE ARE IN FOR 
SURPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An uninvited guest slipped into the living room of William and Jan Brankin's 
Simi Valley home the other day: a baby Southern Pacific rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
 Using thick leather riding gloves, William Brankin herded the snake into a 
bucket until he and his wife could relocate the wayward serpent to the hills 
above their Wood Ranch subdivision. Officials say the better course would have 
been to call in an expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brankins' encounter was one of a number occurring across Southern 
California this spring as warmer temperatures draw snakes into the back yards 
-- and sometimes the homes -- of people living near the foothills and deserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Between April and October, depending on the weather, animal control officers 
and firefighters respond to thousands of snake sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first rush of snakes are starting to show up," said Bruce Richards of the 
Los Angeles County animal regulation office in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell people to expect it because it's going to happen," he said. "It may 
be only one rattlesnake, but that may be the one that gets you." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Brankin, who has a 3-year-old son and baby-sits two other toddlers, said 
the children had played in the family's back yard most of the afternoon before 
the reptile wound its way into the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little worrying, especially with small children around," Brankin said. 
"But we're encroaching on his land as much as he's encroaching on ours. Just a 
few years ago this whole area was barren. We'll be keeping a closer eye on the 
yard from now on, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Already this season -- the breeding period for rattlesnakes -- Richards and 
his colleagues have responded to 11 rattlesnake calls in the hills around 
Thousand Oaks. They've answered another two dozen calls throughout their 
region, which stretches from Chatsworth to Topanga and west to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two rattlers were reported Wednesday in a man's driveway in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said they looked like they were dancing, but I know what they were doing 
and it wasn't dancing," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County fire crews have responded to 21 calls, and Ventura County 
animal regulation workers have responded to at least a dozen more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason we have this onslaught so far in Thousand Oaks is because the 
temperatures have been so summerlike," Richards said. "That sends a signal to 
the rattlesnakes to come out from where they hibernate." 
</P>
<P>
 California is home to four general varieties of snakes: rattlers, and gopher, 
garter and king snakes. The non-venomous garter, gopher and king snakes account 
for most of the 120 species that make up the four varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattlesnakes -- representing six different species -- are the only venomous 
snakes in California. The most common by far is the Southern Pacific rattler, 
which grows to about six feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers in Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park east of San Juan Capistrano have 
already reported several snake sightings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "People usually see them along the trails, but they avoid them and the snakes 
slither back into the brush," park official Gina Drury said. "We've had several 
sightings, but no bites." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that animals are more often the victims of snakebites than human 
beings because they are curious and ignorant about the reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a horse died within 30 minutes of being bitten by a rattlesnake at 
O'Neill Regional Park in Orange County. The woman riding the animal told 
officials that the snake seemed to attack the horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very aggressive rattlesnake," Park Ranger Ron Slimm said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 One emergency room physician said he hopes this season is nothing like a year 
ago, when heavy rains increased the rat and mice populations -- the favorite 
food of many snakes -- and brought him a host of rattlesnake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a real run last year," said Dr. Philip Macniel, an attending physician 
at UCI Medical Center in Orange. "At one point we had four (bite victims) in 
the course of three weeks. One of them was particularly ill and had to be put 
on life support." 
</P>
<P>
 Snake sightings typically occur in the deserts and foothills -- and in the 
housing developments that have sprung up next to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our calls are in Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and Simi Valley," said Sandi 
Wells of the Ventura County Fire Department. "They're hot, dry valleys and we 
have a fairly large population of people in those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said just one rattlesnake bite has been reported so far this season: a 
mountain biker in the Rincon hills north of Ventura who sat in a patch of tall 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rattlers really seem to be aggressive when they're disturbed," Wells 
said. "People should be careful when they're hiking and stick to well-used 
trails." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific rattlers, however, do not limit themselves to undeveloped 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Burbank Animal Shelter routinely answer snake-sighting calls 
in the hills flanking the city. When they do, one officer said, they do not 
bother trying to relocate the snake. Instead, they hack it to death with a hoe 
or shovel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We respond immediately to the call, and the snake is dispatched on the spot," 
said Senior Animal Control Officer Harold Hagler, who said the season so far 
has been somewhat slow with only a handful of reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "These mountains have all kinds of hikers," Hagler said. "You can't relocate a 
poisonous reptile to where a citizen could get bit." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's determined to be a rattlesnake, we kill it on the spot," Capt. Ken 
Maffei said.

MANDELA SCOLDS GUN-TOTING SUPPORTERS AT RALLY; ELECTIONS: CANDIDATE SAYS ANC IS 
COMMITTED TO CONTROLLING FIREARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA. MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT DE 
KLERK MAKES LAST-DITCH APPEAL FOR VOTES. 
</P>

<P>
 It was supposed to be a speech about sacrifice and struggle, about ending a 
long journey and starting another. Instead, Nelson Mandela was furious. 
</P>
<P>
 At a campaign rally in South Africa's largest black township Saturday, the 
gray-haired president of the African National Congress and all-but-certain next 
president of South Africa was greeted with the rattle and roar of guns being 
fired into the bright blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 60,000 cheered wildly as the impromptu salute of shots echoed for 
several minutes across the vast soccer stadium. But an open microphone caught 
Mandela complaining angrily to someone on the makeshift stage: "I asked you to 
frisk everybody here. Nobody should come in here with weapons!" 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, as the gunfire subsided, Mandela chastised his supporters. "It 
is clear that criminality, even among members of the African National Congress, 
is deep-seated," he thundered. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that the ANC is committed to gun control, he added: "It is quite clear 
our organization has been penetrated by criminals. . . . If I find out the 
people who are firing these guns, I have no alternative but to expel them from 
the organization. We do not want them!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela has tried to rein in his more militant supporters since his release 
from 27 years in prison in 1990, as the constitutionally entrenched racism of 
apartheid began to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with his victory virtually assured when the country's black majority 
votes for the first time in three days of elections that start Tuesday, Mandela 
faces the heavier burden of governing a fractious society awash in assault 
rifles and steeped in a culture of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The death throes of white minority rule have claimed more than 13,000 lives in 
the last four years, largely in brutal clashes between rival members of the ANC 
and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Two ANC members distributing campaign literature were killed Saturday in 
Ulundi, the capital of KwaZulu, the Zulu homeland that Buthelezi controls. The 
men were reportedly shot and their bodies burned after an angry crowd 
surrounded a dozen ANC workers. The survivors took refuge in a police station. 
</P>
<P>
 KwaZulu and surrounding Natal province are under a state of emergency, and 
violence has fallen sharply since Buthelezi dropped a lengthy boycott and 
joined the race last week. He cut short his campaigning and rushed back to the 
volatile capital after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cape Town, President Frederik W. de Klerk wrapped up his long-shot 
campaign, making apologies for the past and promises for the future to a 
foot-stomping, singing and cheering crowd of mostly mixed-race Colored 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we made mistakes," De Klerk told 10,000 people packed into the Good Hope 
Center, an auditorium built on the former site of District Six. 
</P>
<P>
 That thriving multiracial community was destroyed by the all-white National 
Party government three decades ago because it was in a "white area." Many of 
its residents were forced at gunpoint into crowded townships. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have rectified our mistakes. And we have made this the best country in 
Africa under National Party rule," De Klerk said. "We know how to build, and we 
will continue to build with your help." 
</P>
<P>
 The supporters, bused in from Colored townships as far as 60 miles away, 
sported T-shirts, visors and buttons bearing De Klerk's likeness. About 1,000 
people were turned away from the packed auditorium. Inside, the president was 
interrupted again and again by enthusiastic applause and chants. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk chose the Western Cape, one of nine new provinces, for his final 
rally because polls show it is the only province the National Party is likely 
to win. Colored voters are in the majority there, and many support De Klerk 
despite the injustices of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Colored voters fear they will suffer even more under a black-led 
government, perhaps losing the privileges they have had in jobs and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "De Klerk is the only person who stands for us," said Anthony Kleinbooi, 25, 
from the Colored community of Belhar. "Mandela stands only for his people. He's 
black, and he's for his people." 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk arrived holding the hand of his wife, Marike, in one of her rare 
public appearances in the area. The ANC has repeatedly reminded Colored voters 
of a remark she made several years ago that Coloreds, being neither black nor 
white, were non-persons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask a mandate in this election, and we promise you that never again will 
there be racial discrimination on one inch of the soil of South Africa," De 
Klerk said. 
</P>
<P>
 His speech was briefly disrupted by a white heckler, who scuffled with Colored 
supporters. But the president intervened, using the interruption to remind his 
listeners of the intimidation that he contends ANC supporters use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please don't hurt the man," he said. "We are a party of peace. Just lead him 
out of here. That's the way the National Party deals with people. We take them 
out quietly, but we don't kill them." The heckler was ushered from the hall 
without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk, running for reelection to the office he won four years ago in 
whites-only elections, has no public appearances scheduled today, the last day 
on which campaigning is allowed. Mandela will hold his final rally in Durban.

DISPUTE DELAYS AIR STRIKES IN BOSNIA; BALKANS: WHITE HOUSE WARNS OF LIKELY 
ACTION. BUT U.N. VETO OF NATO'S REQUEST FOR ATTACKS UNDERSCORES DIFFICULTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The White House warned Saturday that NATO air strikes may be inevitable to 
halt a rebel assault on a Bosnian enclave, but senior U.S. officials 
acknowledged that retaliatory action had already been delayed a day because of 
a dispute between NATO and U.N. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of hectic diplomacy that underscored the difficulties of 
coordinating a military operation burdened with several layers of command, a 
senior Administration official confirmed that the United Nations had vetoed a 
NATO recommendation to commence the air strikes Saturday in retaliation for 
Bosnian Serb attacks on Gorazde that violated a North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization ultimatum issued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to play down the U.N.-NATO disagreement as merely a temporary 
"delay" that would not undermine the allies' resolve, the official said the 
Clinton Administration was "close to an agreement with the U.N. on how to 
proceed" with air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials also stressed that the Serbs should not "misread" the delay as 
a sign of weakness or lack of resolve, adding that strong punitive measures are 
"inevitable" if the Serbian forces continue to defy the NATO ultimatum. Air 
strikes "are only a matter of time unless they comply," one senior official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Clinton Administration aides sought to minimize what had 
been an embarrassing and inauspicious start to NATO's efforts to agree with the 
United Nations on the timing of what would clearly be a major escalation of 
U.S. and allied military involvement in Bosnia's 2-year-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in Brussels on Friday, NATO officials set three deadlines for Bosnia's 
rebel Serbs. The first called for an immediate cease-fire, which U.S. and U.N. 
officials said the Serbs continued to violate throughout the day. The second 
deadline, which expired at 2:01 a.m. today (5:01 p.m. PDT Saturday), mandated 
the withdrawal of all Serbian forces from the embattled city to an area at 
least 1.9 miles away. The third deadline gives the Serbs until 2:01 a.m. 
Wednesday (5:01 p.m. PDT Tuesday) to move all their heavy weapons at least 12 
miles away from Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Serbs do not abide by these conditions, the allies threatened, NATO's 
Southern Command would be authorized to conduct air strikes against heavy 
weapons and other military targets within a 12-mile radius of Gorazde. But the 
agreement also specified that the United Nations would have to approve the air 
strikes before they went ahead -- a condition that provoked a behind-the-scenes 
crisis Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Serbs continued to shell Gorazde after the NATO ultimatum was 
issued, Adm. Leighton Smith, the NATO commander for Southern Europe, asked for 
permission to launch the air strikes before the withdrawal deadline expired, 
U.S. and U.N. officials confirmed. But arguing that the Serbs with whom he was 
negotiating in Belgrade needed more time to comply with the ultimatum, Yasushi 
Akashi, the chief U.N. representative in the region, refused. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. source acknowledged that both U.S. officials and NATO commanders 
were furious with Akashi's veto, fearing that it would send "precisely the

ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute underlines what critics said are the immense problems posed by 
giving the United Nations veto power over military decisions involving U.S. and 
other NATO forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to run a war in which you have about 12 layers of 
decision-making, and it's proving to be pretty difficult," said former 
Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who was interviewed on CNN's 
"Newsmaker Saturday."

ISRAEL-PLO PACT MAY COME DURING CHRISTOPHER VISIT; DIPLOMACY: SECRETARY OF 
STATE EMBARKS FOR MIDEAST TODAY. HE IS ALSO EXPECTED TO DISCUSS PEACE WITH 
SYRIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher leaves today on a Middle East tour that 
could coincide with a long-awaited agreement on Palestinian rule in Jericho and 
the Gaza Strip and the launching of a separate peace initiative by Israel and 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, the trip could mark closure of the first phase of the 
Mideast peace process that began in Madrid three years ago, and a shift of 
focus to the second front: Syria's contentious dispute with Israel over return 
of the strategic Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story is that it's time to change dance partners, from (PLO Chairman) 
Yasser Arafat to (Syrian President) Hafez al Assad," said Robert Satloff, 
executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials are publicly playing down expectations 
because of past failures to overcome final hurdles in talks between Israel and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization. But senior officials said privately that 
they think Christopher's itinerary could include the formal signing of a pact 
on Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very strong prospects of a signing," one official said Saturday. 
"For weeks we've said they're 90% done. Both parties have now signaled to us 
that they're closing on the final details." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there have been signs of movement in Cairo and also in Bucharest, 
Romania, where Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres held a series 
of meetings last week. Arafat returned to his headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, 
on Friday, observing that an agreement is "in sight." Cairo is the probable 
site for a signing, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final obstacles involve issues of jurisdiction, air and sea rights and 
prisoner releases. Israel recently conceded on security and refugee issues, 
including the size, composition and powers of the new Palestinian police force 
and the weapons it will be allowed to use. 
</P>
<P>
 In advance of Christopher's trip, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin talked 
last week about the possibility of ceding the Golan Heights and even 
dismantling Jewish settlements in exchange for peace with Syria. U.S. officials 
called the statement "very important" and "well timed." 
</P>
<P>
 Syria responded Saturday by welcoming Rabin's remarks. "A step was made by 
Rabin when he recognized the necessity of dismantling settlements and 
(recognized) that peace, not settlements, would provide security," wrote 
Tishrin, the official newspaper of Assad's government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the newspaper added pointedly, "Rabin knows well that peace with Syria is 
impossible without the return of the whole Golan." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin was army chief in 1967 when Israel captured the stark plateau 
overlooking northern and eastern Israel, which had provided Syria a military 
advantage. More than 100,000 Israelis now live in the Golan's Jewish 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 After stops in London, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and in Cairo, Christopher is 
expected to arrive in Israel to talk over details of Israeli ideas for peace 
with Syria, which he would then carry to Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in the PLO-Israeli talks -- in which the United States mainly 
facilitated direct discussion -- Christopher is expected to play a bigger role, 
possibly involving some shuttle diplomacy between Israeli and Syrian officials, 
sources on both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, U.S. officials tried to dampen expectations. "We've never been just 
mailmen," one senior U.S. official said. "But how people perceive our role 
might change." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Christopher trip, direct negotiations are scheduled to resume in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Significant Syrian-Israeli talks have been on hold for nine months, even 
though they began before the initial Israeli-PLO accord last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel has evidently concluded that the PLO track cannot be the engine to 
drive the peace process over the long haul," Satloff said. "Only the Syria 
track can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Israel has devised a full-fledged package for a peace 
agreement with Syria. The plan includes commitments on sovereignty and peace; 
timetables for withdrawal and normalization, and procedures for mutual security 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be a momentous occasion for the peace process," Satloff said.

 He pulled a 265-pound sled on skis. He braved polar bears and temperatures of

 The 31-year-old Norwegian adventurer sent a pre-coded message -- "Expedition

SINGAPORE OFFICIAL LABELS CRITICISM OF FLOGGINGS ABSURD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government on Saturday defended its controversial policy of flogging 
vandals and said it is absurd for critics from countries with high crime rates 
to question Singapore's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense of the justice system was made by Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan 
Seng after nearly a month of increasingly vitriolic exchanges between Singapore 
and the United States over the decision to sentence an 18-year-old American, 
Michael P. Fay, to six strokes of a rattan cane for spray-painting cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody takes any joy in carrying out these strict punishments, be it 
imprisonment, caning or execution," Wong said in a speech. "But it has to be 
done, it must be done. Laws will not be effective if the penalties for flouting 
them are not sufficiently strict." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay is serving a four-month jail term also imposed in the case and awaiting 
the outcome of an appeal for presidential clemency in the caning part of the 
sentence. A Hong Kong teen-ager convicted in the same case was sentenced last 
week to 12 strokes of the cane and eight months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's parents, as well as U.S. officials, contend that Singapore's government 
uses a double standard: Other cases involving damage to private property have 
brought charges of "mischief," not vandalism, which carries a mandatory 
sentence of caning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong, however, said that Singapore upholds the ideal "that all are equal 
before the law, regardless of whether they are Singaporeans or foreigners, rich 
or poor." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has called the caning sentence "extreme." The punishment 
flays the skin of the buttocks, can induce shock and leaves permanent scars. 
But Wong said caning, which is carried out about 1,000 times a year in 
Singapore, is neither cruel nor unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is absurd that societies so stricken with crime should attempt to apply 
their standards on us and teach us what to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong mentioned the case of a youth in San Leandro, Calif., who was sentenced 
to four weekends of community service for spray-painting buildings. He said he 
had read that the police involved in the case had expressed the wish that the 
youth could be punished in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was not suggesting that other countries adopt Singapore's approach. 
But he added: "While we believe that an individual has certain rights, the 
overriding consideration has to be what is in the community's overall good and 
its long-term interest. The fundamental question we ask ourselves is, who 
should pay the price for crime, the criminal or the law-abiding citizen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wong referred obliquely to allegations from Fay's parents and others that 
police hit and threatened the teen-agers arrested in the spray-painting case to 
coerce them into signing confessions. He said every complaint is taken 
seriously and investigated. In Fay's case, the police have said an 
investigation showed he was not abused.

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; REPORTER RECALLS SEEING NIXON TAKE A TRIP DOWN MEMORY 
LANE; MEDIA: A PASADENA NEWSMAN INTERVIEWED FORMER PRESIDENT IN 1980 AS HE WAS 
BIDDING A NOSTALGIC FAREWELL TO HIS OLD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an opportunity not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a 23-year-old reporter for the Pasadena (Calif.) Star-News when a 
restaurant bartender phoned in a tip to the newsroom: 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nixon, the Richard Nixon, was at the restaurant, in the city of San 
Gabriel, having lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days I was what passed for the paper's politics reporter. And Nixon, 
who had resigned the presidency 5 1/2 years earlier, was nearly a recluse at 
his San Clemente estate. He had not granted an interview in years to a 
newspaper reporter, a couple of whom had unearthed the scandal that drove him 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
 I sprinted out of the newsroom with one certainty in mind -- Richard M. Nixon 
would not leave that restaurant before I reached him. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for me, the afternoon of Jan. 31, 1980, was not a time of high 
alert for the usually vigilant police forces of Pasadena, South Pasadena, San 
Marino or San Gabriel. I remember approaching 90 m.p.h. on the downhill grade 
of Atlantic Boulevard -- with not a radar gun in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling to within a block or so of the restaurant, I noticed a shiny 
recreational vehicle, led and followed by two sedans with antennas sticking 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 This had to be Nixon. And he was leaving! Heading for a freeway, I figured. 
Back to the seclusion of San Clemente, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of curiosity, I joined the ersatz motorcade; after just a few short 
blocks, the procession pulled into the historic San Gabriel Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 I parked and walked toward the front of the building, where the RV was 
stopped. A Secret Service agent intercepted and questioned me. He spoke into 
his two-way radio. I was surprised when the word came back: Nixon would see me. 
</P>
<P>
 I met him just inside the foyer. He stood in his gray suit, jacket buttoned, 
presidential pin on the lapel, relaxed yet formal. He appeared, for lack of a 
more fitting description, presidential. With him were at least four aides, 
including Raymond Price, his former presidential speech writer. 
</P>
<P>
 We shook hands and began with some small talk, which took on the tone of a 
trivia challenge. When I told Nixon what paper I represented, he thought for a 
moment and blurted out, " Ridders! " the family that then still partly owned 
the publication. 
</P>
<P>
 "What college did you go to?" Nixon next wanted to know. "San Jose State," I 
said. Instantly, he shot back, " Spartans ! Good football team!" 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Nixon what he was doing in the San Gabriel Valley. He said that he was 
touring parts of his old congressional district, the one he represented from 
1946 to 1950, making a nostalgic farewell. The next week, on Feb. 9, 1980, 
Nixon would leave California and relocate to New York, where he would work 
nonstop to refurbish his image. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists at the mission began bunching around us, taking pictures. (A few 
weeks later one of them, a retired lawyer from Skokie, Ill., sent me a color 
slide. It shows a smiling, rather comfortable Nixon with his arm around the 
shoulders of an expressionless 23-year-old journalist, sans coat or tape 
recorder.) 
</P>
<P>
 All of which underscored what I saw as the oddity of our encounter. Nixon told 
me that, before lunch, he had visited the auditorium at South Pasadena High 
School, "where I had my first debate." 
</P>
<P>
 I informed him that my parents had attended that debate. This excited him. 
"Your mother was at my debate?" he asked. Immediately he turned to Price. 
"Ray," he said, "get me a pen. . . . What's your mother's name?" On the spot, 
Nixon signed an unsolicited autograph to my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 What I didn't tell Nixon, what I couldn't put in my article 14 years ago, was 
that my mother was no admirer of Richard Nixon. I was raised in a household 
that was, to say the least, absolutely anti-Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Cambodia, Kent State or Watergate, I grew up hearing over and again how 
Nixon had viciously snuffed the career of five-term Democratic Rep. Jerry 
Voorhis, by all accounts a decent man with a liberal voting record. Of how 
Nixon unfairly linked Voorhis' support for subsidized milk for poor 
schoolchildren to socialism. Of how, four years after winning election to the 
House, Nixon similarly attacked incumbent Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas to win 
a seat in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Nixon that day whether he would try to contact Voorhis, who at the 
time was still alive, a few miles away in Claremont. Based on Nixon's surprised 
reaction, it clearly was a notion that had not crossed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon would make some news that day in our half-hour interview. For the first 
time, he called the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan a "violation of the precepts 
of international conduct." He endorsed President Jimmy Carter's announced 
intention to boycott the upcoming Olympic Games in Moscow, although he 
predicted that it would have little effect on the Russians. Regarding an 
expanded role for women in the American military, Nixon said: "I think the 
suggestion that women be registered and be drafted is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon told me that his latest book was about to be published and that he would 
be sure to send it to me. From the man regarded as history's ultimate 
anti-media President, this was quite a charm offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 And, sure enough, I arrived home three months later to find "The Real War" on 
my doorstep, complete with a personal inscription from the 37th President of 
the United States.

<P>
 Condolences poured in from around the globe as world leaders paid tribute 
Saturday to Richard Nixon as an international statesman who achieved diplomatic 
triumphs from Moscow to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon continued until the end of his life to offer behind-the-scenes advice to 
many of the world's powerbrokers, including in a controversial visit to Moscow 
just last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusually warm statement Saturday, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
said: "I am shocked by the death not only of an extraordinary man but also of 
one of the greatest politicians in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became convinced that he was one of the first major world politicians who 
have understood Russia, and understood what it was fighting for," Yeltsin said. 
"He had a special attitude toward Russia. He was deeply concerned about our 
developments. . . . I really respected him sincerely and with all my soul and 
regarded him as one of the most influential politicians in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement said a Russian presidential representative will be sent to 
Nixon's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's remarks contrasted with his angry reaction when Nixon arrived in 
Moscow in March and met with several of Yeltsin's political archenemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin later lifted a ban on Russian government officials meeting with Nixon 
but did not himself receive Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before his fatal stroke, the former President was discussing the 
possibility of a return visit to meet with Yeltsin, Nixon's adviser on Russian 
affairs said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimitri K. Simes said Nixon had been approached from "senior levels of the 
Russian government" to learn whether the ex-President would be willing to 
travel to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was willing to go provided that it was also certain that the invitation 
came directly from Yeltsin, and that this time there would be no 
misunderstandings," Simes said. Yeltsin's press office said Saturday evening 
that it was not aware of any such discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a matter of pride to him to be able to respond to insults when 
necessary, but to stay above them in the purpose of a higher interest," Simes 
said in a telephone interview from Washington, where he heads the Russian 
program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, a frequent visitor to Moscow and one of Yeltsin's earliest champions, 
felt his mission was "being effective on behalf of Russian democracy," Simes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev also expressed his condolences to 
Nixon's family, saying: "Nixon's contribution to the search for an end to the 
Vietnam War and, of course, his efforts in reducing the arms race and lessening 
international tension will enter into history." 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk fondly remembered Nixon's visit to Kiev 
last month. "Mr. Nixon deeply understood the problems facing Ukraine in 
establishing statehood, and sincerely tried to facilitate their resolution," he 
said. "The Ukrainian people give heartfelt thanks for his friendship and 
cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 In China, where Nixon's "Ping-Pong" diplomacy led to the reopening of U.S. 
relations with the world's most populous nation, top leaders praised the former 
President for bringing both countries closer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telegram of condolence, President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng hailed 
Nixon as "a politician with strategic long-term vision and political courage 
(who) . . . opened the door for a new era in Sino-American relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Tang Wensheng, who interpreted for Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier Chou 
En-lai during Nixon's historic visit to Beijing in 1972, echoed that view. 
</P>
<P>
 "History has proved," Tang said in a telephone interview Saturday, "that the 
bold decision to normalize Sino-U.S. relations was wise and farsighted." 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese national television began its Saturday night news programs with the 
report of Nixon's death. The New China News Agency described Nixon, who visited 
China five times after his historic February, 1972, trip, as "an old friend of 
the Chinese people." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly saddened were the Zheng family, owners of a popular 
"Western-style" restaurant near the entrance of the Qing Dynasty Summer Palace 
on the outskirts of Beijing. Although its Chinese name is Wei Lan, the 
restaurant is popularly known as "Nixon's Restaurant" because of a 1985 visit 
the former President paid during a personal investigation of market reforms in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 A large photograph of Nixon and chef Zheng Weizhi hangs prominently on one 
wall of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he came in and had a picture taken with my father," said Zheng Haibin, 
the chef's son, "business has done very well. We owe our success to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam's Foreign Ministry had only a one-sentence reaction to Nixon's death: 
"May he rest in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Vietnamese remember Nixon as the man whose bombers pounded the big 
cities of Hanoi and Haiphong during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't grieve over his death," said retired soldier Hoa Van Tap, 63, who 
now repairs bicycles on Hanoi's streets. "But the war is over and he is dead, 
and as we say, 'Although there is hatred, death is the end.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A government official said ordinary Vietnamese no longer had special feelings 
about Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He belongs to history, the history of the Vietnam conflict," he said. "I 
don't think we have any personal feelings in favor of or against Mr Nixon. He 
did what he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 General Vo Nguyen Giap, architect of the Communist victory in that war, was 
not available for comment on Nixon's death. 
</P>
<P>
 In Phnom Penh, an adviser to both of the Cambodian prime ministers said the 
Cambodian people would not look back on Nixon with ill will. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon initiated a secret bombing campaign against Cambodia to eliminate 
sanctuaries for Vietnamese Communist rebels during the war and ordered a joint 
U.S.-South Vietnamese invasion of eastern Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if he did something bad to Cambodia in the past, we should not recall it 
now because it brings us nothing," said Muon Saokhan, adviser to First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
 In other reaction from around the world: 
</P>
<P>
 * British Prime Minister John Major, in a message to President Clinton, paid 
tribute to Nixon "for his tireless work for a better understanding between East

relations across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 At an Earth Day celebration in Palo Alto, he was the man who divided a nation 
during the turbulent 1960s. And in his hometown of Whittier, he was a local boy 
who rose from humble beginnings to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation Saturday, Americans sifted through a complicated mix of 
emotions as they remembered Richard Nixon. One day after the 37th President 
died, he was lauded for improving Cold War relations with the Soviet Union and 
China and vilified for his role in the cover-up of the Watergate break-in. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, former soldiers offered 
conflicting assessments of the man who presided over some of the bloodiest 
episodes of the Vietnam War but later began the U.S. withdrawal from the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, he got me home 20 days early," said Roy Jessee, 45, a former infantryman 
who was selling T-shirts at a booth to raise money for veterans. He said Nixon 
was no worse than any other White House occupant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just got caught," Jessee said. "Watergate, Whitewater -- what's the 
difference? Nixon was just the scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby tent dedicated to a final accounting of the missing in action, 
veteran Valerie Menard said she prayed for Nixon on Saturday morning. But she 
criticized him for not doing more for the troops she said were left behind in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it that he said everyone was back," Menard said. "That was 
obviously, blatantly false." 
</P>
<P>
 In Yonkers, N.Y., at a small, family-run drugstore, customers praised Nixon as 
a wise statesman whose writings and foreign travels offered a unique 
perspective on the Soviet Union and China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what he wanted to do in the years after (his resignation) was make 
some contribution, and I think he did do that," said Barbara Smith, an 
assistant school principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made some mistakes," she added, "but we all do." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, several members of Orange County's congressional delegation 
remembered Nixon with particular fondness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon was a towering figure in American politics, a man whom I believe 
history will remember as a great statesman, a man with an incredible grasp of 
our nation's interest abroad," Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) said Saturday in 
a statement released by his aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially at this time, when our foreign policy is uncertain at best, we can 
learn a lesson from Nixon -- the quintessential Cold Warrior: advance democracy 
abroad through leadership, negotiate peace from a position of strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) called him "a central figure in the central 
struggle of the 20th Century -- the struggle (for) freedom and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 "President Nixon was a great national resource. His vision on the critical 
foreign policy issues of our time has always been of high caliber and lasting 
significance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the honor to be with him at a dinner recently. His analysis of world 
affairs -- delivered without notes, as usual -- was crisp and comprehensive. He 
was still a master on top of his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a politician, he was virtually without peer," Royce said. "People who 
think Bill Clinton is the comeback kid have very short memories." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, Nixon's home state, the former president was remembered by 
figures ranging from actress Zsa Zsa Gabor to former Democratic Gov. Edmund G. 
(Pat) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a dedicated liberal, supported Nixon's opponents for Congress, Senate 
and the presidency, and in a statement Saturday, he said he was "most proud" of 
his own defeat of Nixon in the 1962 governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagreed in principle and in practice, in ideals and ideas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, there has been a mellowing between Dick Nixon and myself," 
said Brown, who was appointed by Nixon to a commission on the Franklin D. 
Roosevelt Memorial and co-chaired the first U.S. visit of China's table tennis 
team under Nixon's "Ping-Pong diplomacy" of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Nixon invited Brown to the Yorba Linda library to discuss their 
1962 contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is a great healer," Brown said. "President Nixon accomplished some great 
things for our nation. He will be missed by his friends." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) got to know Nixon after he 
returned in exile to Orange County. She was running for Assembly in 1976, and 
Nixon saw her debate on TV. She got a call from Ken Khachigian, who said the 
president had complimented her on the debate. "That was a real ego boost," she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after, she met Nixon during a gathering at the Western White House. 
He asked Bergeson about her career intentions and urged her to run for 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really was a very warm person on a one-on-one basis when you had an 
opportunity to be with him in a small gathering," Bergeson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Watergate episode was unquestionably "a mistake" on Nixon's part, 
the people of Orange County never lost faith, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing about Orange County is that everyone stayed loyal to 
him, even in the critical times when the world had forsaken him because of 
Watergate," she said. "People who had known him never lost support for him. It 
was a personal attachment, and it was a sign of respect for his ability and his 
leadership in foreign policy and other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) concurs. "I think that any 
community is proud when one of its own achieves greatness," he said. "I think 
Orange County felt very proud, even when he was at his lowest point. If you had 
polled Orange County during Watergate, I think Richard Nixon still could have 
gotten elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson knew of Nixon early in his career. Ferguson's aunt in Whittier gave 
Nixon one of his first political parties when he ran for Congress after World 
War II. As a Marine Corps officer, Ferguson met then-Vice President Nixon 
during a campaign breakfast in Ohio and later at a reception in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Nixon will always be remembered for Watergate and his foreign policy 
efforts, Ferguson said many people forget that the former president played a 
big part in putting environmentalism on the national agenda with the 
establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any environmentalist would salute him, but it wasn't the fuzzy 
thinkers who started this, it was Nixon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who is running for state attorney 
general, said, "It is now the appropriate time to reflect on his positive 
contributions to life as we know it here today in the United States -- most 
notably establishing detente with the former Soviet Union and opening the doors 
to China." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg said the Watergate scandal left him with a sense of betrayal back then. 
"Now, 20 years have elapsed and I can put Watergate and the events surrounding 
it in a different perspective," Umberg said. "One healthy thing is that we know 
that government can survive a crisis, and that institutions are stronger than 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 A famous former protester against the Vietnam War, state Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica), expressed "compassion" for Nixon, but said he and the former 
president stood at opposite poles of the 1960s "intergenerational breakdown" 
between youth and their World War II-generation parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, who was indicted by the Nixon Administration for inciting a riot 
during the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, faulted the former president 
for failing to understand the youthful rage of that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than seeing the protests that swept the country as a legitimate 
reaction to a war many felt was unjust, Nixon chose to view the dissenters as 
pawns of foreign agents and Communist propaganda, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he could not deal with was that it was an honest reaction to his 
generation," said Hayden, who was attending a rainy Earth Day celebration in 
Palo Alto. "That was what was tragic about Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 In his hometown of Whittier, Nixon was the prime topic of conversation 
Saturday. Many remembered him fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of Nixon, I don't think first of Watergate. I think of foreign 
policy. I think the country is really going to miss his consultation," said one 
resident, Gary Walker. "I think he'll be remembered as a great elder 
statesman." 
</P>
<P>
 At tiny Whittier College, where Nixon was graduated in 1934 before attending 
attending law school at Duke University, flags flew at half-staff. On the 
athletic field of the wooded campus, Nixon and his late wife, Pat, are listed 
among the major underwriting donors of the complex's lighting system. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the college's Hall of Fame, there is a plaque honoring Nixon's 
less-than-illustrious football career. He was a "great inspiration to (the) 
team with halftime pep talks, bench-cheering leadership," the plaque reads. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Hug, who was strolling on the campus with her 9-year-old son, Daniel, was 
a freshman at Whittier High School in 1969. She said she remembers students 
being torn between their allegiance to the home-grown president and their 
growing opposition to the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 She said some came to consider Nixon as "the enemy incarnate." Her own views 
softened over the years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Daniel, who considers himself a history buff, Nixon's death was a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was pretty sad. We lost a President who lived here," he said. 
"He went to school right here."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; NIXON'S RELATIONS WITH CALIFORNIA RAN HOT AND COLD; 
HISTORY: THE NATIVE SON WON HOUSE, SENATE AND WHITE HOUSE JOBS. BUT HE HAD 
TROUBLE WINNING RESPECT AT HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the boom days following World War II, veterans returning to California 
thought anything was possible, and a young Navy veteran named Richard Nixon 
seized the opportunity by running for Congress in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began a turbulent political career spanning four decades during which 
Nixon and his native state shared an ambivalent relationship. California gave 
Dick Nixon stunning political success and humiliating defeat. And while Nixon 
-- the only native Californian to become President -- briefly sought refuge 
here after the disgrace of Watergate, he twice spurned his home state to live 
in New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Richard Nixon was from California but not really of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, but "he was not of any other place," observed Mervin Field, 
founder and director of the California Poll, and the state's most veteran 
political analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so lonely, so insular, so isolated," Field said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among California political figures, Nixon appeared to have few real friends or 
cronies, Field added. 
</P>
<P>
 He won seven elections here: 1946 and 1948 races for the House, 1950 for the 
U.S. Senate, 1952 and 1956 as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice presidential running 
mate, and 1968 and 1972 for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike most of the successful California politicians of his era -- men 
like Republicans Earl Warren and Goodwin J. Knight and Democrat Edmund G. (Pat) 
Brown Sr. -- Nixon was no glad-hander who was liked and admired from both sides 
of the partisan aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who came to dislike Nixon got their revenge in 1962 when he lost his 
race for the governorship to Brown. Haggard, weary and unshaven, Nixon appeared 
before reporters the next morning to issue perhaps the most famous utterance in 
California political history: "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore 
because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be far from his last press conference, of course. In fact, it wasn't 
even a press conference. Nixon strode into the meeting room on the seventh 
floor of the Beverly Hilton Hotel on that Nov. 5, delivered a 20-minute 
diatribe aimed mostly at the reporters themselves, and then stalked out without 
taking any questions. 
</P>
<P>
 From that day on, Nixon never seemed to be happy living in California, except 
for visits to the Western White House at San Clemente before his presidency 
began to crumble under Watergate. After the resignation, San Clemente became a 
place of self-imposed exile, former aides said, and in 1980 Nixon left 
California permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 As did most Americans, Californians mellowed in their feelings toward Nixon 
over the years. In a California Poll conducted several years back, a 
significant number of respondents thought Nixon merited appointment as a 
special ambassador or presidential counselor, pollster Field said Saturday. 
Beyond that, they drew the line: They did not want him to run for any public 
office again. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Richard Nixon and California comes full circle Tuesday when his 
remains are flown west in a presidential jet to lie in state at the Nixon 
Library in the town of his birth, Yorba Linda. He will be buried on the library 
grounds Wednesday, next to the grave of his wife, Pat. 
</P>
<P>
 The obituaries will focus on his achievements as a world leader. But a small 
group of aging California politicians still feels the enmity seared into their 
public psyches by Nixon going back to his very first campaign against popular 
U.S. Rep. Jerry Voorhis, a five-term Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of his contemporaries, Nixon launched his career in 1946 with help 
from political kingmakers who often decided who should run for what office and 
when. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon was virtually unknown and without campaign resources when he entered the 
contest against Voorhis. One day, however, the wife of a prominent and wealthy 
Los Angeles-area Republican leader, Asa Call, attended a candidate forum in 
Whittier, Nixon's other home town. She went home to tell her husband that Nixon 
was a comer and worthy of help, Call later related. 
</P>
<P>
 And he got help. Murray Chotiner, a campaign strategist whose major role was 
working for U.S. Sen. William F. Knowland, was delegated to advise Nixon on a 
part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
 With Chotiner, whose name became synonymous with political tricksterism, Nixon 
perfected the modern negative campaign in California. He exploited the people's 
fears of communism to question the loyalty of his Democratic foes. 
</P>
<P>
 During his successful race against Voorhis, Nixon followed Chotiner's advice 
and ran a "high risk" campaign, charging in a debate that a labor organization 
which had endorsed Voorhis was infiltrated by Communists and fellow travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Nixon came to the attention of Kyle Palmer, political editor 
of The Los Angeles Times, then a bastion of Republican conservatism. Legend has 
it that Palmer was a virtual right hand of the Republican Party in California, 
with the power to make or break GOP aspirants. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning reelection in 1948, Nixon began making preparations for a run 
for the U.S. Senate in 1950 against Helen Mary Gahagan Douglas, a popular 
actress then also serving in the House. The relative significance of Palmer's 
role in the making of Richard Nixon is debated to this day. But one comment in 
Nixon's memoirs about the 1950 Senate campaign gives credence to the legend. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the fall (of 1949)," Nixon wrote, "I learned from Kyle Palmer, the 
astute political editor of the Los Angeles Times, that if I became a candidate 
for the Senate I would be endorsed by the Times. I received similar assurances 
about the San Francisco Chronicle and the Oakland Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 "These endorsements were vital not only for the boost they would give my 
candidacy but because they would virtually assure that I would not face any 
opposition in the Republican primary." 
</P>
<P>
 UC Berkeley political science professor Eugene Lee observed this past week: 
"It was a different kind of California politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the television-dominated campaigns of today, newspaper 
endorsements were, indeed, critical, and The Times, the Chronicle and Tribune 
were particularly influential. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times shed its reputation for favoritism to Republicans after Otis 
Chandler became publisher in 1960. Today, no reputable newspaper would advise a 
candidate beforehand whether he or she was going to get its endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1950 campaign, in Nixon's words, was "one of the most hectic and heated 
campaigns of my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon issued a flyer printed on pink paper listing congressional votes by 
Douglas that were, Nixon said, similar to those of the only avowedly 
pro-communist member of Congress. More than 20 years before Watergate, Douglas 
tagged him as "Tricky Dick." The name stuck, but Douglas' political career 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon defended himself in his memoirs with a statement that has become 
standard in negative campaigns today: He was not attacking Douglas personally, 
or her character. He was merely citing her voting record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subsequently controversial 'pink sheet' that my committee issued was, in 
fact, inspired by . . . comparisons of the two voting records. Whatever 
interpretation was later placed on these facts, no one was ever able to 
challenge their accuracy. All we added was the mordant comment of the color of 
the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Field said that Douglas probably would not have won anyway but that "any 
chance she might have had was just obliterated by the no-holds-barred 
soft-on-communism attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's political ambition caught up with him in his attempt to wrest the 
governorship from Pat Brown in 1962, two years after Nixon narrowly lost the 
presidency to John F. Kennedy (Nixon carried California by an electoral 
whisker). 
</P>
<P>
 Political experts give a variety of reasons for Brown's victory: He was a 
bumbler, but a popular one; the Cuban missile crisis of October pushed the 
election campaign into the background just as Nixon was beginning to chip away 
at Brown's lead in the polls (Brown suspended his campaign and went to 
Washington for civil defense briefings), and that Nixon focused too much on 
national and foreign affairs rather than state issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that he didn't give a damn about California," said one veteran of the 
Brown campaign who asked not to be identified by name. "We talked California 
until he couldn't stand it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 And Brown forces claimed that Nixon only wanted the California governorship to 
maintain a political base for his next race, for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon said pressure on him to run for governor began almost from the day he 
returned to California after losing to Kennedy and completing his second term 
as vice president. His intuition told him "it would be a case of running for 
the wrong office at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 But in his memoirs, published in 1978, Nixon said he decided to make the 
plunge after he was told by an influential adviser: "Either you run or you're 
finished in national politics." 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally announced for the governorship, in September of 1961, Nixon 
was running 13 points ahead of Brown in the California Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 By April, Brown had moved ahead by six points, and his poll lead stayed in 
that range right through the Nov. 4 balloting, which Brown won by a margin of 5 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 Field said his polling consistently showed that most of the factors now 
recited for Brown's victory had little to do with the outcome. Nixon lost 
because a significant number of voters really suspected Nixon saw the 
governorship as a steppingstone to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dark side of the Nixon personality had been shown, and they turned on 
him," Field said. "It wasn't that Brown was able to turn it out. They started 
voting no on Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 Time would tell: The voters basically were correct. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Nixon wrote: "The real problem was that I had no great desire to be 
governor of California." 
</P>
<P>
 In the famous press conference, his bitterness about the newspaper coverage of 
his campaign spilled out, mostly aimed at one of the two Los Angeles Times 
reporter who covered it. The Kyle Palmer era had passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon said The Times had reported his own flub of saying he was running for 
governor of the United States but did not report a miscue of Brown's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it is time that our great newspapers have at least the same 
objectivity, the same fullness of coverage, that television has," Nixon added. 
"And I can only say, Thank God for television and radio for keeping the 
newspapers a little more honest." 
</P>
<P>
 The same edition of The Times carried a Page One statement by Publisher 
Chandler noting that The Times had supported Nixon in every one of his 
campaigns, including three editorials backing his candidacy for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Just prior to the press conference, Nixon also got in a lick at his home 
state. While walking through the lobby en route to the session, he was heard to 
say: "Losing California after losing the presidency -- well, it's like being 
bitten by a mosquito after being bitten by a rattlesnake." 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, a friend urged Nixon to move to New York because "now that 
I had lost the election, nothing tied me to California . . . and that I would 
find life there much more interesting and stimulating," he said in his memoir. 
</P>
<P>
 By the following June, the Nixons were New Yorkers.

 "What history will remember is that Nixon was the only President who could go 
to China without being redbaited by Richard Nixon . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "People have been talking about how hard it was for him to govern when he was 
elected in 1968, because the country was so divided. But history will note it 
was divided largely because Nixon himself deliberately divided it."

RICHARD NIXON: 1913-1994; NAMESAKE'S DEATH PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON O.C. LIBRARY; 
MUSEUM: THE NATIVE SON WILL BE LAID TO REST NEAR HIS BOYHOOD HOME. THE TOWN 
SAYS IT'S READY.

 Crowds it can handle; dignitaries too. After all, Barbara Bush was just there 
Friday, and it has hosted Presidents before. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, as the nation watches, the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace 
will be on display as never before while former President Nixon is 
memorialized, recalled in terms both glowing and sober, eulogized and finally 
buried there. 
</P>
<P>
 For the $21-million facility, it is an opportunity to show off the combination 
museum and library that its founder envisioned, helped finance and finally 
launched in 1990 with much fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be boasting about how it was built without government funds, how it 
competes amid a sea of tourist attractions and how its new public affairs 
center may help shape policy debates into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the fact we're likely to have two Democratic Presidents and three 
Republican Presidents -- Ford, Reagan and Bush -- it will be a big week," said 
former Nixon speech writer Kenneth L. Khachigian of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for me," he added, "it won't be as important without Richard Nixon being 
at the center of activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yorba Linda facility, which opened in July, 1990, is still the only 
presidential library in the country run entirely without public funds. But 
financially, it has been an uphill climb as the library has tried to penetrate 
Southern California's tough tourist market. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make comparisons with our library and those run by the Department of 
Interior, our gate receipts are equivalent, if not better, than some of them," 
Roland E. Bigonger, 67, a member of the library's executive board who helped 
establish the facility, said Saturday. "The problem is we're not operating with 
government funds, and I think the President was very proud of the fact that he 
didn't want to use government funds." 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library in Austin, Tex., 
receives about $2.3 million a year in federal funds; the Jimmy Carter library 
in Atlanta gets about $1.6 million; and the Ronald Reagan library in Simi 
Valley receives about $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon library includes a 5,500-square-foot main facility and the simple 
wooden farmhouse Nixon's father built from a kit. In its first year, the 
library had a deficit of $577,301 on expenses of $3.1 million, according to 
Internal Revenue Service records. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Taylor, Nixon library director, cut operating expenses the following 
year to $2.6 million. But the facility had revenue of $1,627,743, resulting in 
a deficit of $962,298, IRS records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials said early expenditures included costs for advertising, 
promotions and special exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 They also reflected costs associated with the library's sponsorship of 
numerous exhibitions, policy conferences, town meetings and forums. 
</P>
<P>
 The library's board of directors and former President Nixon did not want the 
library to be a "sleepy place that was preoccupied with the past and sold 
tickets and souvenirs," Taylor has said. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the library got a boost with the launching of a new policy center, 
the Center for Peace and Freedom, which will be based at the library and in 
Washington. A $5-million grant from Walter H. Annenberg, who was U.S. 
ambassador to Britain under Nixon, kicked off the center's funding, which is 
estimated at $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda officials said they believe the library may become an even bigger 
tourist attraction after Nixon is buried next to his wife, Pat, who died last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no Graceland, said Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley, "but I imagine when 
it becomes the final resting place for Nixon, it will end up like Graceland. I 
think his and Pat's final resting place will become an attraction and will 
continue to be an attraction for tourists." 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the library, normally $4.95 for adults and $1 for children 8 to 
11, will be free during a mourning period that will run through May, library 
officials said.

LIBERTARIANS BACK STERN IN RUN FOR N.Y. GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS GOLDBERG, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surrounded by an entourage of screaming, disorderly fans and scantily clad 
women, talk radio host Howard Stern on Saturday won the New York state 
gubernatorial nomination of the relatively staid Libertarian Party, insisting 
all of the time that his candidacy was not a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the old-time Libertarians talked seriously of ballot access, cutting 
back government and eliminating welfare, hundreds of Stern supporters packed 
the hall, waving rubber sex toys, heckling the other candidates and waiting for 
their chance to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 To the dismay of some of the party faithful, Stern won on the first ballot, 
with 287 of the 381 delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am honored to be the Libertarian candidate," said Stern, as two women 
danced on the dais. "For any of you who had doubts about me -- I am serious. I 
am in this to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I look out on this shining crowd and see all your beautiful faces, I have 
only one thing to say: It's amazing they let you people vote," Stern told his 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hours that followed, many party regulars came to agree, as they 
battled unruly Stern fans over how the vote should be conducted and, 
implicitly, over their small, not particularly successful, party. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a travesty to the history of libertarianism," Robert Flanner, 59, 
chairman of the Brooklyn delegation, yelled as hundreds of recently registered 
Stern supporters shouted him down and laughed. Flanner, a founding member of 
the Libertarian Party 21 years ago, insisted that he would resign if Stern were 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, 40, spoke about his campaign platform: signing the death penalty into 
law and then handing over the reins of government to his candidate for 
lieutenant governor, little-known former state legislator Stan Dworkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has wrapped up the nomination, Stern's supporters must gather 
15,000 signatures from 16 congressional districts around the state to get on 
the ballot in November to challenge Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 But winning the election will not be easy: Polls have shown that although 
Stern is known by more than 75% of all New Yorkers, he is viewed negatively by 
nearly as many.

 Former President Richard Nixon was Yorba Linda's native son. He spent time in 
many Orange County cities before, during and after his White House years. A 
look at "Nixon Country" and what he and others said about his Orange County 
years: YORBA LINDA 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "In the daytime I could see the smoke from the steam engines. 
Sometimes at night I was awakened by the whistle of a train, and then I dreamed 
of the far-off places I wanted to visit someday." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nixon, from "The Memoirs of Richard Nixon"  
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "We will always call him Richard because one day his mother, Mrs. 
Hannah Nixon, came to school for something ... and said, 'By the way, Miss 
George, please call my son Richard and never Dick.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary George Skidmore, Nixon's first-grade teacher at Yorba Linda Elementary 
School  
</P>
<P>
 * Nixon presidential library opened July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "Today, the battle I started to wage in 1946 when I first ran for 
Congress is not over. I still have a few rounds to go." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nixon, from "In the Arena" SEAL BEACH 
</P>
<P>
 * He played in the ocean during childhood years. On one occasion, the family 
took Nixon's Uncle Lyle, who had visited them, by bus from Ohio, to swim here. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "He did not have a swimsuit, and so we had to rent one from a 
concession stand at Seal Beach. The only one we could get that fit him was an 
old-fashioned, grotesque-looking knee-length model. . . . I was somewhat 
embarrassed when other people on the beach laughed at him." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nixon, from "In the Arena" FULLERTON 
</P>
<P>
 * Attended Fullerton High School as a freshman and sophomore, 1926 to 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "I vividly recall ... when Miss Ernsberger gave our geometry class a 
difficult problem and told us that anyone who solved it would get an A in the 
course. I started to work on it at 9 o'clock at night at the table in the 
kitchen. It was a bitterly cold night, and I kept warm by lighting the fire in 
the gas oven and leaving the door open. Right after my mother came down to bake 
pies for the store at four in the morning, I got the answer. After that I never 
thought there was a problem I couldn't solve, if I worked hard and long 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nixon, from "In the Arena" LA HABRA 
</P>
<P>
 * Practiced law, 1939-1942. By 1941, Nixon was president of the Orange County 
Assn. of Cities. DANA POINT 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposed to Thelma Catherine (Pat) Ryan, 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "When Pat Ryan finally said yes at the edge of Dana Point, sitting 
in an open car in the starlight with the sound of waves breaking below, she 
knew she was in love. She loved Dick's romantic nature, which had brought them 
to Dana Point, and his visions of a great future." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Julie Nixon Eisenhower, from "Pat Nixon: The Untold Story" CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
<P>
 * Dined at the city's Five Crowns Restaurant in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "We had 20 minutes' warning. A White House staffer called and 
ordered a little alcove for five people, and I said, 'You're kidding.' I didn't 
really believe it until the police pulled up out front." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Manager John Ondyke, in 1969 SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
<P>
 * Dined at the El Adobe de Capistrano in Old San Juan. TRABUCO CANYON 
</P>
<P>
 * Nixon dined and even had his necktie snipped off at the Trabuco Oaks Steak 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "He came out to the restaurant two or three times for dinner. He not 
only liked the food, but he and the Secret Service loved the back room because 
it had no windows and was private." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steve Nordeck, who bought the restaurant in 1987 ORANGE 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1984, Nixon addressed more than 3,000 people at the Hutton Sports Center 
at Chapman College in Orange, speaking on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "Students here are 20, 21, 18 and 19, and Nixon was before our time. 
Now we're getting a taste of what we missed -- the opportunity to be directly 
involved with a former President. We think it's a big deal to have him come 
here. We feel it sort of sets a mark as far as where Chapman stands in the 
community, even though Nixon isn't exactly everyone's favorite fellow." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Student Dan Bowen, then 19 ANAHEIM 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1959, Vice President Nixon and family opened the monorail with Walt 
Disney in Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nixon was a baseball fan and friend of Angels owner Gene Autry. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "Gene was good friends with Richard Nixon who was an American League 
fan from his days in Washington when he followed the Senators. Anaheim Stadium 
was reasonably close to Nixon's home in San Clemente, so he would come to our 
games and sit up in Gene Autry's private box. On occasion Nixon would come down 
to the clubhouse and visit and talk baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 -- From "Throwing Heat: The Autobiography of Nolan Ryan"  
</P>
<P>
 * A $100-a-plate fund-raising dinner preceded a major campaign rally at the 
Anaheim Convention Center in September, 1968. Then Nixon returned to the 
stadium directly after his election for a homecoming celebration Jan. 2, 1969. 
Two years later, he came back to campaign for Republicans in the mid-term 
elections. MONARCH BAY 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1977, David Frost interviewed Nixon from the home of Harold and Martha 
Smith. In discussing Watergate, Nixon said that it might be correct for a 
President to break the law if he did so in the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "I let down my friends. I let down the country. I let down our 
system of government and the dreams of all these young people that ought to get 
into government but think it's too corrupt. . . . I let the American people 
down, and I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nixon, in Frost interview NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
<P>
 * After his resignation, he made his first public appearance at the Newport 
Beach Marriott on July 4, 1976. EL TORO AIR STATION 
</P>
<P>
 * Flew to El Toro after resigning as President on Aug. 9, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "As our plane circled the El Toro Marine Base on the afternoon of 
Aug. 9, I could see hundreds of cars lined up, trying to get into the already 
overflowing parking area. I had not thought I could find the energy to make 
another speech that day, but I managed to thank them for welcoming us home, and 
I vowed to continue to fight for the great causes of peace, freedom and 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nixon, from "In the Arena" SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
<P>
 * While President, Nixon established the Western White House at La Casa 
Pacifica. He sometimes walked the beach below wearing a coat, tie and wingtips, 
and often entertained world leaders inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * When the Watergate scandal drove him from office, Nixon and his wife, Pat, 
retreated to La Casa Pacifica, and lived there for more than a decade before 
moving to the New York City area. 
</P>
<P>
 * While John Wayne was going through his final battle with cancer, he visited 
Nixon in San Clemente for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: "When I went to mix a martini for him, I could not find the 
vermouth. So I just put a good slug of gin on the rocks, added a twist of 
lemon, and served it to him myself. I can still remember the delight in his 
eyes after he took a sip and said in his gravelly voice, 'My, that's good.' "

 Forget Watergate. Never mind about China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Saigon on Saturday, Vietnamese refugees mourned Richard Nixon as the 
American who they believe tried hardest to save their beloved homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the greatest President of the United States and one of the greatest 
leaders of the world," said Dr. Co D.L. Pham, a physician who heads the 
Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. "When Nixon resigned, all of us felt like we 
lost our President. We respected him and we adored him so much. We look at him 
like a savior." 
</P>
<P>
 With Vietnamese music blaring over loudspeakers and the smells of homemade 
treats surrounding them, thousands strolled through the bustling Asian Gardens 
Mall on the afternoon after the death of the 37th President Friday night. Here, 
in the center of the largest Vietnamese community in America, Nixon was 
remembered with fondness and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnamese community will have some special day in his remembrance," Tim 
Pham, 34, who fled to the United States in 1975 after the fall of Saigon, 
predicted as he sat in Asian Gardens eating lunch with his wife and two young 
children. "To my generation, he's one of the most famous Presidents." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mall's courtyard cafe, people sipped iced coffee, slurped noodle soup 
and puffed on cigarettes. Amid the Vietnamese conversation at table after table 
came the word "Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel great sympathy for his death. It's a great loss both for the state 
and for the Vietnamese as well," said Phuonganh P. Nguyen, 28, a health 
counselor. "The leaders of the Congress, Democrat and Republican, they should 
follow the path that he set. He is a great one." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Nixon's policies that enraged the American public are the very 
measures that make Vietnamese immigrants revere him. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he campaigned in 1968 on a promise to end U.S. involvement in the 
Vietnam War, Nixon instead escalated the bombing of North Vietnam and expanded 
attacks into Cambodia and Laos. And he announced plans for a "Vietnamization" 
of the war by training and equipping the South Vietnamese to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "For (Vietnamese) Nixon is maybe the most familiar name of a politician," Yen 
Do, editor of Nguoi Viet Daily News, the community's largest newspaper, said. 
"He means hawk for Vietnamese. Everybody knows that he was a very, very strong 
anti-Communist. He was a real hero for the refugees because he was a strong 
anti-Communist and because he was a strong leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very, very sad that he passed away. We feel that we lost a friend, an 
important American statesman who understood Vietnam," Do said. "This is the end 
of an era. The man who made several decisions about Vietnam and Vietnamese life 
has disappeared. Now there are no more American politicians who were involved 
deeply in Vietnam left." 
</P>
<P>
 To these immigrants, Watergate is seen not as a disgraceful mistake but as an 
unfortunate distraction. Many blame the American public, not the former 
President, for making it a scandal, and believe that overreaction to the 
burglary at the Washington hotel-and-office complex and the events afterward 
interrupted Vietnam's best chance for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this country, people care more about domestic policy of a President, but 
to us we look abroad. We appreciate foreign policy and we thought he was one of 
the best Presidents," said Quynh N. Nguyen, who fought in the Vietnamese Navy 
and now is a computer programmer in Lakewood. "It's regrettable that 
(Watergate) happened. Maybe it is one of the causes of our defeat in Vietnam, 
because we didn't have his full support or attention because of the problem 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who were babies during the war have fond feelings for Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a friend to our country," said Le Nguyen, 22, a student at Cal State 
Fullerton. "He was a very brave President. He tried his best to save our 
country, and I really appreciate the way he worked for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know a lot of history about (Nixon). I was small, so I don't know a 
lot about what was happening. All I know is he helped our country. That's 
important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Dhanh Nguyen, 58, a former soldier in the Republic of Vietnam, said he cried 
when he learned of Nixon's death Saturday morning on Orange County's weekly 
Vietnamese radio program. Sitting at the Asian Gardens Mall, talking about 
Nixon, he nearly wept again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He killed Communists, that's good," Nguyen said through an interpreter. "I 
love Nixon. I respect Nixon."

MEDIATOR MEETS WITH TEAMSTERS, TRUCK FIRMS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives of the Teamsters and 22 trucking companies held their first 
meetings with a federal mediator Saturday in an attempt to end a nationwide 
trucking strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meetings were constructive," said Catherine Kaliniak, spokeswoman for 
Trucking Management Inc., which is representing the companies."The gaps are 
still wide between the parties." 
</P>
<P>
 More meetings were scheduled for today, Kaliniak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Transportation Secretary Federico Pena 
asked the two sides to accept mediation in letters to Teamsters union President 
Ron Carey and Arthur H. Bunte Jr., president of Trucking Management. Both sides 
accepted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70,000 Teamster truck drivers and dockworkers struck the carriers on 
April 6. The two sides have disagreed primarily over the shippers' use of 
trains and their hiring of part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides returned to the bargaining table in Washington on Monday and 
continued negotiations throughout the week, but were unable to reach agreement.

<TEXT>

 Adm. Frank B. Kelso formally stepped down as the Navy's top officer, ending a 
career tarnished by the Tailhook scandal. Adm.Jeremy M. Boorda took charge 
after a change of command ceremony at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. Boorda 
referred to the Tailhook sexual abuse scandal indirectly when he pledged to 
continue to push the Navy down the road toward "real, total, equal opportunity. 
. . . Let me say, and there has been a lot of talk about this, Frank Kelso 
brought us a long way along that road," Boorda said. The Senate had approved 
Kelso's retirement, after 38 years in the Navy, at his current rank, overriding 
a motion by all seven women senators that he be demoted and have his pension 
cut because of the Tailhook scandal.

COURT CHOICE: JUDGE OR POLITICIAN?; JUDICIARY: ALL CURRENT JUSTICES ARE FROM 
LOWER COURTS. MANY CLINTON AIDES BELIEVE THE BACKGROUND OF THE HIGH COURT 
SHOULD REFLECT MORE DIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Is there such a thing as being too judicial to be a good Supreme Court 
justice? 
</P>
<P>
 Many of President Clinton's advisers think so, and that argument has become a 
key factor as Clinton continues to mull whom he should pick to fill the vacancy 
on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 After reconvening his advisers Friday for their first full meeting on the 
court search in a week, Clinton must still resolve several major questions, 
aides say -- ranging from doubts about the future health of one leading 
candidate, federal appeals court judge Richard S. Arnold of Arkansas, who has 
had cancer, to the politically sensitive matter of whether to appoint a member 
of a minority group, and, if so, from which group. 
</P>
<P>
 But another central issue that remains for the President to decide is whether 
the high court nomination should go to a professional judge, or whether he 
should appoint a political figure to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of that argument is a 56-year-old appeals court judge from New 
York named Amalya L. Kearse. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the selection process, Kearse's name has been one of the few that 
Clinton consistently has had under serious consideration, Administration 
officials say. Kearse is a judge of unquestioned brilliance, widely respected 
by her colleagues, and the first black woman ever to become a partner in a 
major New York law firm. She is seen as a liberal on issues of civil liberties 
and civil rights, but as more conservative on business-related and federal 
regulatory issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Clinton and his advisers keep finding as they scour their lists of 
potential nominees, no one is perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 One argument against Kearse, ironic in an Administration that talks often of 
the need for diversity, arises because of Kearse's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways," a senior White House official said, "when you add up the 
interest group politics, when you go for an African American, it is even worse" 
than appointing a white nominee. "The Hispanics and Asians say, 'Gee, what 
about us?' " That problem could be particularly acute because of the widespread 
talk early in the process about filling the current vacancy with a Latino 
nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more widely voiced objection, and the one aides say Clinton has been 
wrestling with, is the claim that the Supreme Court needs more diversity of 
background. For most of its history, the high court has included some people 
with previous experience as judges, and others who were political figures, law 
professors or practicing attorneys before being nominated. Now, however, all 
nine members of the court are people who joined directly from lower courts -- a 
pattern that many Clinton advisers feel should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointing Kearse won't accomplish that, the senior official conceded. "She's 
not a politician, she's not that 'other' person." 
</P>
<P>
 "There just is not much diversity of experience on this court," complained 
another White House official, voicing a line heard frequently from Clinton 
advisers. Kearse, this adviser grumbled, would only reinforce what is already 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton adviser James Carville puts the argument more bluntly: "Politicians 
make the best justices," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have looked at several politicians who might be 
viable court nominees, but most have come up short. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, for example, is a close friend of 
Clinton's, a highly regarded lawyer and well-liked among many in and around the 
White House. But Baliles is virtually unknown outside his home state. 
Appointing him could also draw strong objections from liberal groups and at 
least some labor unions because of positions he took while governor and 
Virginia attorney general. "Baliles might engender some real opposition," said 
the leader of one liberal group. "He would be a major problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Other White House aides have talked of appointing Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes of 
Maryland, but political advisers fear the Democrats, already working with a 
dangerously thin margin in the Senate, might not be able to hold onto his seat. 
A similar argument could apply to Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, whom some 
officials have discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others have talked of House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), although 
a senior Clinton aide conceded that appointing him "brings some of the same 
problems as (Sen. George J.) Mitchell" in terms of disrupting the congressional 
leadership. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, has declined to be considered 
for the court in favor of spending the remainder of his term working for health 
care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Clinton's advisers argue that a justice with a political background 
could meld together the court's scattered moderates into a more cohesive force, 
changing the culture of an institution in which the nine justices conduct their 
business with little direct interaction except through written memoranda. 
</P>
<P>
 History provides mixed support, at best, for that theory. In recent decades, 
some politicians appointed to the court, such as the late Chief Justice Earl 
Warren, have exercised great influence. But so, too, have many non-politicians, 
such as John Marshall Harlan or William J. Brennan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan excelled at forging coalitions more than any of the political figures 
he served with on the court; indeed, he did so more than any other justice in 
the last half century. At the same time, many politicians appointed to the 
court have been quickly forgotten -- justices like former Sen. Harold Burton or 
former Treasury Secretary Frederick M. Vinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the attraction of finding a politician-candidate for the court 
has been strong for the President and his aides. Mitchell, Clinton's initial 
choice for the seat, fit the bill entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 But since Mitchell's withdrawal, White House aides have faced trouble finding 
a political figure who would command the sort of admiration enjoyed by 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to appoint someone who is not a judge," said one White House 
aide, "the person really has to have some heft."

 House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has joined a political debate over 
gay rights that is threatening to force the Olympic Summer Games out of a 
strongly Republican suburban community he represents in Congress. The 
conservative was quoted by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as labeling 
attempts by gay activists to have the Olympics ousted from Cobb County, which 
lies just north of Atlanta, as "emotional blackmail." Last summer, county 
officials approved a measure that sought to support traditional family values 
by condemning the homosexual lifestyle.

 The president of the University of Rhode Island has had a change of heart 
after coming under fire for passing over NOW President Patricia Ireland as 
commencement speaker."I don't have anything against Ms. Ireland. She's a fine 
person, leader of an important national organization," Robert Carothers said. 
On Thursday, baseball's National League president withdrew as the school's 
commencement speaker after learning that Ireland had been rejected. Leonard 
Coleman Jr. declined to give the speech because he didn't want to exacerbate 
the campus dispute.

OFFICER SHOT DOWN OVER IRAQ IS EULOGIZED BY FIANCE; FUNERAL: FIRST LT. LAURA 
ASHLEY PIPER, A 1992 AIR FORCE ACADEMY GRADUATE, IS BURIED NEAR THE CHAPEL 
WHERE SHE WAS BAPTIZED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First Lt. Laura Ashley Piper, whose helicopter was mistakenly shot down over 
Iraq, was buried Saturday near the same Air Force chapel where she was baptized 
25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The pews were lined with Air Force cadets in somber blue. They stood proudly 
during the posting of the colors, as the flags were placed by marching cadets, 
and again when the casket, covered with a U.S. flag, was guided in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laura's a modest person, she'd be taken aback by all this," said Piper's 
fiance, Lt. Dan Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 The cadets sat stiff-necked, eyes forward, until Murray began sharing his 
recollections of Piper. As he remembered the woman who he said loved to giggle, 
who talked with her hands in constant motion, repeatedly broke her nose playing 
rugby and always lost her term papers to computers, the dignity of her comrades 
gave way to grief and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray saw his fiancee days before her death while the couple vacationed in 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we kissed goodby . . . she was happier than I've ever seen her," Murray 
said. "She knew she was loved, she was happy and she was off on another 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 Piper was one of 26 people, including 15 Americans, who died April 14 when two 
U.S. jets mistakenly fired on two helicopters carrying a United Nations relief 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper, an air operations intelligence analyst stationed in Ramstein, Germany, 
was on a temporary assignment in Turkey. She was helping with a mission to 
rebuild Kurdish villages destroyed by Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper was in the fourth grade when she read in the Stars and Stripes newspaper 
that the Air Force Academy, her father's alma mater, was about to begin 
admitting women. She decided then to go, her mother, Joan, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper graduated in 1992. She was a model cadet: fluent in German and Russian, 
a champion rugby player and a champion shot putter for the school's 
track-and-field team. 
</P>
<P>
 She always kept in touch with her family, sending postcards to her 10-year-old 
brother, Sean. Her parents had planned to visit her in Germany this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Piper remembered her daughter as someone who loved her life, loved her 
country and loved the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother recalled her own wedding, a renewal of vows and Laura's baptism, 
all in the Air Force Academy chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the campus cemetery, four F-16 fighter jets flew overhead. Then one of the 
planes in the Missing Man Formation broke from the others and flew straight up 
toward the heavens in a tribute to a fallen comrade.

JUSTICES TO ENTER ABORTION CLINIC'S 'BUFFER ZONE'; SUPREME COURT: A CASE OF 
'FREE SPEECH VERSUS FREE ACCESS' AT A SURGICAL CENTER IS HIGH COURT'S FIRST 
CHANCE TO WEIGH AGGRESSIVE PROTESTERS' FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past 15 months, the front line in the abortion war has been the narrow 
street that runs between the only abortion clinic in this coastal county and a 
neighboring home that is owned by Operation Rescue activists. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesdays and Saturdays, when surgery is performed at the Aware Woman 
Center, as many as 400 protesters regularly fill this street. Some kneel and 
pray at the driveway leading to the clinic. Some stand quietly and offer 
pamphlets to those who enter. 
</P>
<P>
 And many use more aggressive tactics. They swarm around approaching cars and 
shout to the women inside: "Mommy! Mommy! Don't let them kill me!" They hold 
pictures of fetuses against car windows. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the street next to the clinic will become the focal point for the 
year's biggest legal battle in the abortion war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on whether a judge has the 
constitutional power to impose a "buffer zone" around an abortion clinic to 
keep out anti-abortion protesters. Dubbed the case of "free speech versus free 
access," it will mark the first time that the high court speaks directly on the 
First Amendment rights of anti-abortion protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, the justices have been surprisingly silent on the issue 
as abortion protesters have clashed with police outside clinics in dozens of 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In its only written ruling touching on the subject, the court in 1988 upheld 
part of a Wisconsin town's ordinance -- designed to protect a local doctor from 
persistent anti-abortion protesters -- that prohibited picketing on residential 
streets and in front of homes. In Frisby vs. Schultz, the court said picketing 
targeted at a particular home can be outlawed, but picketing on a public street 
must be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, judges in at least 25 cities have been confronted with the 
question of when constitutionally protected protest crosses the line to become 
illegal harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 That issue is at the heart of the Melbourne case, Madsen vs. Women's Health 
Center and Aware Woman Center, 93-880. Not only will the Supreme Court decide 
the constitutionality of a judge-imposed buffer zone, but it also may determine 
the fate of a pending federal law intended to protect abortion clinics from 
"intimidation" and "interference." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, due by July, could even affect the many new laws against 
"stalking." Under these measures, judges often shield celebrities and others 
who have been the targets of harassment by requiring that their tormentors not 
approach within a certain distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The case before the high court took shape early last year when demonstrations 
at the Aware Woman Center rose in intensity, and both sides brought in 
reinforcements from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Keith Tucci, the leader of Operation Rescue, had made Melbourne a 
training center for committed anti-abortion activists. They learned, among 
other things, how to use state records to trace automobile license plates in 
order to gain personal information, including the home addresses, of everyone 
who visited the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic employees found themselves targeted both at work and at home. In 
February, one nurse said she was forced to move after a dozen protesters 
knocked at her door, confronted her three daughters and advised them to tell 
their mother to "stop killing babies." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters also jammed the clinic's phone lines. They followed a physician 
into a hotel coffee shop and pointed him out as a "child murderer." At night, 
they dumped a foul-smelling acid at the doorway of the clinic and put glue on 
door locks. In early March, after an abortion doctor in Pensacola, Fla., was 
shot and killed by an anti-abortion activist, two of three physicians who 
practiced at the Melbourne clinic quit, saying they feared for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been living under mob rule," said Patricia Baird Windle, owner of the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The year before, a state judge had issued an order prohibiting the abortion 
protesters from blocking the entrance to the Melbourne clinic or "physically 
abusing" its patients and employees. In late March, lawyers for the clinic 
sought a stronger order. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-day trial, Judge Robert McGregor handed down a broad decree on 
April 8, 1993, that barred the anti-abortion protesters from demonstrating on 
the street or on the sidewalk next to the clinic. This area became part of a 
36-foot buffer zone where protesters were prohibited from "congregating, 
picketing, patrolling or demonstrating." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the judge said, the protesters may not come uninvited within 300 
feet of a clinic employee or patient, whether at the clinic or at their homes. 
He barred the protesters from singing, chanting or making other loud noises 
while surgery was performed. He told police to trace calls from people trying 
to harass the clinic. Violators were to be arrested on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 McGregor justified his order with evidence showing that the anti-abortion 
protesters "continue to impede and obstruct" the clinic's operation and to 
"shadow and stalk" its employees. Moreover, the loud demonstrations threatened 
the medical well-being of the patients, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the protesters free to make their views known by carrying signs, 
offering leaflets or chanting quietly on the far side of the street. That did 
not satisfy the protesters, who saw the order as a free-speech violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to educate, not harass," said Norma Munroe, a 62-year-old 
grandmother who regularly protests outside the Melbourne clinic. "It's killing 
a baby, and I have a right to say it." 
</P>
<P>
 Munroe said she and several dozen other demonstrators were arrested one 
Saturday simply for nonviolent protest on the public sidewalk. "I was kneeling 
and praying, and they arrested me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's order "puts an absolute ban on peaceful free speech on a public 
street," said Mathew D. Staver, an Orlando, Fla., attorney who is representing 
the abortion protesters before the Supreme Court. It "censors only pro-life 
speech," he said, while permitting the clinic's defenders to chant and sing 
songs on the sidewalk. The high court has often frowned on laws or judicial 
orders that discriminate against one message but not another. 
</P>
<P>
 Staver also cites a civil-rights era precedent in which the Supreme Court 
overturned an order by a Mississippi judge that punished blacks for organizing 
a boycott of white-owned businesses in 1966. Then, the high court said judges 
cannot punish "legitimate political expression" simply because some of the 
boycotters had used threats of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But an attorney for the clinic counters that throughout U.S. history, judges 
and the police have been empowered to intervene when protesters go too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not debate. It's intimidation," said Talbot D'Alemberte of 
Tallahassee, Fla., a nationally prominent First Amendment advocate and former 
president of the American Bar Assn. "If their purpose is to communicate a 
message, they can be heard" without resorting to harassment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic staff members say their patients often arrive for surgery anxious and 
distraught, with their blood pressure elevated. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most of these women, this is the worst day of their lives. The screaming 
and the signs (of aborted fetuses) just punish them more," said Phyllis Erwin, 
a local mother who became a volunteer "clinic defender" after learning through 
family research that her grandmother had died during an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Alemberte is relying on the series of rulings that have said picketing and 
protest can be restricted in its "time, place and manner." For example, 
protesters outside a city hall or a courthouse have a right to make their views 
known, but police can forbid them to parade on the sidewalk directly in front 
of the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has struggled with this issue, and its decisions have been 
divided. Two years ago, for example, the court on a 5-4 vote upheld state laws 
imposing a 100-foot zone around polling places where campaigning, even handing 
out leaflets, is forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, also on a 5-4 vote, the court upheld a U.S. Postal Service regulation 
that forbids soliciting or leafleting on sidewalks leading to a post office. 
Two years before that, however, the court on a 5-3 vote struck down a District 
of Columbia ordinance that prohibited unfriendly picketing within 500 feet of a 
foreign embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting these conflicting precedents, the lower courts are divided on 
whether buffer zones are legal. Indeed, McGregor's ordinance resulted in two 
opposing rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously upheld the order, ruling 
that the restrictions on picketing near the clinic "were necessitated by clear 
abuse" by Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same month, the U.S. appeals court in Atlanta struck down the judge's 
order on a 2-1 vote. "On its face, the injunction appears to 'criminalize' 
various acts of peaceful protest, including the mere penetration of the buffer 
zone" by anti-abortion activists, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a possible damage suit for enforcing an unconstitutional order, the 
Melbourne police announced that they will not enforce the buffer zone -- 
pending a final ruling by the Supreme Court.

THE ELECTRIC CAR: ITS TIME IS HERE -- AND SO IS ITS OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Times auto reviewer Paul Dean drove a state-of-the-art electric car in 
1991, he wrote: "Electric motoring is best compared to softball. The equipment, 
rules and technique are similar. But the pace and excitement are far from the 
real thing. . . . The (50-mile) range of electric cars restricts their roles to 
suburban puddle jumpers. Speed and acceleration are dangerously beneath the 
entrance pace of the Los Angeles freeway system." 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward to last month, when Dean tested a car he dubbed Sparky -- the 
experimental Ford Ecostar van, which has a range of 100 miles between 
recharges. "Throughout seven days with Sparky, we stopped for nothing except 
daily destinations. The little van not only ran at freeway speeds but actually 
passed many among the snorting, polluting, environmentally incorrect. It 
accelerated almost as well as the breeziest subcompacts and . . . held that 
performance whether the battery was 100% charged or nearly flat." 
</P>
<P>
 What a world of difference! It's this sort of progress that's stiffening the 
will of the state and its Air Resources Board to require that zero-emission 
vehicles constitute 2% of the new-car market in the 1998 model year and 10% of 
sales by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three U.S. auto makers, which have claimed over the years that seat 
belts, gas-mileage standards and air bags could ruin their industry, scorn 
electric cars. But even as they lobby against the California standards they are 
reluctantly joining research efforts. They know that they could otherwise lose 
the whole market to public-private initiatives like California's Calstart. Now 
the major oil companies, their gasoline sales on the line, are putting up an 
anti-electric public relations blitz that puts the auto makers to shame. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Michael Parrish wrote earlier this month that an ostensibly 
"grass-roots" protest against utility-company investments in alternative 
vehicles is funded by the Western States Petroleum Assn., which represents oil 
companies. The effort involves 200,000 letters to utility ratepayers (about a 
"hidden tax on your gas and electric bill"), a petition effort and 
demonstrations at public utility offices.  
</P>
<P>
 The oil companies have long argued that their "reformulated gasolines," in 
conjunction with a new generation of catalytic converters, are enough by 
themselves to reach California's clean-air goals. Another often-heard argument 
is that electric cars won't really reduce pollution because electric power 
plants will have to burn something to produce the juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents also argue from the consumer end that auto-addicted Californians 
will never accept the distance and performance limits of electric cars, that 
the right battery hasn't been invented and that anyway it takes years to gear 
up for production. Then there's the $30,000-and-up price tag, to say nothing of 
the $2,500 to $15,000 replacement tab for a state-of-the-art battery. 
</P>
<P>
 In a perverse way, alternative-vehicle advocates are happy about this burst of 
opposition. As they see it, only powerful issues attract powerful opposition. 
And, just as happily, they see answers to the objections. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the fuel issue. Low-emission gasolines are certainly welcome; indeed, 
they are the biggest part of the clean-air solution; oil companies that have 
been reformulation pioneers, such as Arco, deserve great credit. But it's the 
zero-emission vehicles that take the necessary last step; vehicles are the 
source of more than 70% of air pollution, so that problem must be attacked at 
its primary source. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge bonus of electric and electric/gas hybrid vehicles is that if 
California can produce good ones first, Europe and even Japan will buy them. 
That's the attraction for aerospace companies involved in Calstart. The former 
chairmen of Lockheed and Hughes Aircraft are co-chairs of Project California, 
an effort to focus state officials and business leaders on finding industries 
for the future. And battery makers say production can begin easily by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 As for reducing pollution, 35% of California's power comes from plants burning 
natural gas; 20% is hydro-power imports, and the rest is a mix of nuclear, coal 
and renewables like wind and solar. The result, say air-quality advocates, is 
that electric cars are 97% cleaner than today's autos. Investments now in such 
things as consumer recharging stations will turn a profit later as more 
vehicles go electric. And the batteries on the Ford Ecostar are recyclable. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer issues are serious, but they rest on dated assumptions, among 
them that two-car families all want two long-distance vehicles and that 
innovative lease arrangements won't lure consumers. They also assume electric 
cars won't keep improving fast and prices won't go down steeply with mass 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, CD-ROM was not viewed as a consumer technology because of its 
stratospheric cost -- it was targeted at industrial and subsidized buyers, 
mostly schools; less than 20 years ago, barely programmable two-head VCRs 
weighed 30 pounds, lacked remote controls and cost $1,000; and 100 years ago, 
buggy makers were arguing about automobiles scaring the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the thing to be scared of is standing still. Go, Sparky.

AN EMERGING ASIAN TIGER: THE VIETNAMESE CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Kotkin, Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a senior 
fellow at the Center for the New West and author of Tribes: How Race, Religion 
and Identity Determine Success in the New Global Economy (Random House). He is 
also business-trends analyst for Fox news.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two decades after the fall of Saigon, the Vietnamese are the world's 
newest major global tribe. Long the pawns of hegemonic pow ers, they have 
established a world wide economic and cultural net work well-suited to take 
advantage of a potential economic boom in their native country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese diaspora grew out of their national tragedy. When the United 
States withdrew from Vietnam in 1975, almost two million Vietnamese fled into 
exile in more than 50 countries; nearly half settled in North America. The 
largest community is in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the overseas Vietnamese, or viet kieu , have become a de facto 
cosmopolitan people, establishing strong business and communications links in 
such diverse economic centers as San Jose, Greater Los Angeles, Houston, 
Seattle, Paris, Sydney and Vancouver. "It's the beginning of a diaspora 
phenomena," observes Michigan State University sociologist Ruben G. Rumbaut, a 
leading scholar on the community. "The events of 1975 were like a fission bomb: 
They splintered Vietnamese all over the globe." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with the lifting of the U.S. embargo on commerce with Vietnam and that 
country's gradual re-integration into the world economy, this "fission" is 
turning into a "fusion" linking the dispersed Vietnamese communities. The 
Vietnamese are gradually learning how to exploit their dispersion into an 
economic and cultural asset. 
</P>
<P>
 For a traditionally agricultural people, this transformation has been 
unsettling and difficult. In the United States, Vietnamese communities have 
struggled with language problems, high rates of welfare dependency, predatory 
gang warfare and internecine political conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, these problems stem from the suddenness of their departure from 
Vietnam. Three-fifths of all 1975 refugees, notes Whittier College sociologist 
Steven Gold, had less than 24 hours to prepare for exile; four-fifths had less 
than a week. Subsequent immigrant waves have largely consisted of "boat 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the Vietnamese in the United States have begun to make remarkable 
progress. Although as many as 88% of all new refugees start out unemployed, 
within three years, that percentage falls below 30%, according to a University 
of Michigan Study. 
</P>
<P>
 More impressive, virtually destitute communities have created thriving 
immigrant economies, notably in Westminster's Little Saigon. Indeed, even amid 
a still shaky Southern California retail market, the area's landmark shopping 
center, the Asian Garden Mall, is not only fully occupied but has a waiting 
list of 58. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon's economic dynamism in an environment of relative poverty and 
still high unemployment highlights the presence of one segment of California's 
estimated $140 billion "underground economy." Those familiar with Vietnamese 
enterprises admit that many operate outside the formal legal economic 
structure. Sewing shops, even food-processing plants thrive in back yards, 
anterooms and garages, providing income that supplements welfare and other 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnamese are always hiding something," says veteran Vietnamese journalist 
Thuy Le. "The psychology from back home was that we are always being invaded by 
someone, so you never reveal what you are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the next generation of Vietnamese seems certain to find their place 
within the economic mainstream. This prediction is more than simply a result of 
Vietnamese predominating among the ranks of valedictorians in many Southern 
California communities, particularly in northern Orange County. Among 77 
nationalities studied in South Florida and San Diego, Vietnamese youngsters 
boasted, on average, higher grade-point averages and studied longer than 
native-born and other ethnic immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 To Rumbaut, co-author of this study, these cultural factors suggest that, over 
time, Vietnamese welfare dependency and impoverishment will dramatically fall. 
"No group started out more indigent in modern U.S. history than the 
Vietnamese," he says. "But as far as the children are concerned, what is 
clearly happening is an economic shift toward becoming a well-educated and 
economically successful population." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Vietnamese are increasingly represented in the professional and 
technological life of their communities. The under-40 generation, in 
particular, composes much of the technical and engineering staff at many 
high-technology companies in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the greatest opportunities lie in the expansion of links between 
overseas Vietnamese and the emerging economy of their homeland. With nearly 70 
million people and important natural resources, Vietnam is widely expected to 
become the next Asian "tiger." In the last two years, GDP growth has approached 
7%, with double-digit increases in trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanding technical and entrepreneurial prowess of the overseas Vietnamese 
may accelerate economic development back home. Some, like Fountain Valley 
attorney Hoa Phu Truong, use their U.S.-honed skills and Vietnamese cultural 
backgrounds to steer U.S. multinational corporations through the ever-changing 
course of doing business with a reforming communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 These links to the home country could stimulate Vietnamese-oriented businesses 
throughout California. Some realtors report a growing flow of capital from 
Vietnam as entrepreneurs there seek safe havens for their excess cash. Others, 
such as developer Frank Jao, who is most often associated with Little Saigon's 
development, envision more legitimate overseas trade-related activities 
supplanting strictly immigrant-oriented retail business. "Little Saigon will be 
like Koreatown in Los Angeles," Jao predicts, "but well beyond that. It will be 
like Hong Kong is to China." 
</P>
<P>
 For many older Vietnamese, however, potentially profitable economic links pose 
dilemmas. Yen Do, editor of Westminster-based Nguoi Viet, the diaspora's 
leading Vietnamese language newspaper, foresees "a period of confusion" as the 
older generation, within Vietnam and overseas, learns to bury old resentments 
and work for common benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 To smooth this process, Do and other leading Vietnamese business and cultural 
figures have set up an organization called Project Twenty. Its main goal is to 
prepare the community for next April's 20-year observance of the fall of 
Saigon. Do has actively recruited younger Vietnamese because he fears they 
could lose interest in their native country if not participants in its 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, Vietnamese look largely to their traditional enemies, the 
Chinese, who occupied their country for nearly a millennia, as role models for 
their tribe's development. Vietnamese officials have studied the Chinese 
experience in Singapore and Taiwan, as well as the course of the mainland 
market, to guide their economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan and Hong Kong are the dominant overseas investors in Vietnam, helping 
drive per-capita incomes in the area of former Saigon, the traditional focus of 
Chinese interest, to nearly twice those in Hanoi and other parts of the 
country. Even within the local Vietnamese diaspora community, it has been the 
ethnic Chinese, roughly one-third the total, who have been quickest to 
re-establish economic ties with the mother country. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, if the Chinese provide the dominant force, Vietnamese suspicions of them 
may lead officials to seek ever-closer ties with their brethren in North 
America, Australia and Europe. In particular, U.S. technology, capital and 
military might are seen as counterweights to the potential re-imposition of 
Chinese domination over Vietnam and Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years, Vietnam's wayward children could end up with front-row seats 
in the development of a new and powerful Asian economy. For the United States, 
and particularly Southern California, the potential blessings of such a tribal 
connection could be enormous.*

A 'CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT?'; INSISTING THE CRIME PROBLEM IS UNIQUE, PEOPLE ARE 
EVER MORE WILLING TO ABANDON THE BILL OF RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT WEISBERG, Robert Weisberg is a law professor at Stanford University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, Americans seem to be driven mad by the fear of crime. Whether the 
public is influencing the politicians or vice versa, a perverse consensus is 
developing between voters and their elected leaders that we have reached such a 
catastrophic crisis that we must summon the courage to take extraordinary 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call for decisions that would cross legal boundaries even the most 
conservative judges see as clear, bright lines of constitutional protection -- 
as in the call to legalize "sweeps" of inner-city public-housing apartments to 
search for weapons. Congress contemplates the death penalty for drug crimes 
that do not result in death -- in the face of even a Burger Court precedent 
that would seem to make such a law flatly unconstitutional. The "three strikes" 
laws passed in California and other states and now before Congress push the 
cruel mathematics of habitual-offender status at least up to the line of "cruel 
and unusual" punishment. And in recent polls, half of Americans responding 
approve a sentence of physical torture by caning for a young American accused 
of vandalism in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Among politicians, much that we hear is demagogic blather -- not to be taken 
seriously except as a sign of the pathology of media politics. But to the 
extent that politicians and public are sincere in their calls for the new 
measures, this reflects something subtler, if perhaps more dangerous, in our 
political life. It is a kind of historical egotism or arrogance -- a sense that 
our time is unique, so different from "ordinary" times that fundamental changes 
in our constitutional principles must be made. It is as if we take a conceited 
pride in our fear as having exceptional historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Though we face serious crime problems in the United States today, we are not 
in a "constitutional moment." For one thing, though serious crime is certainly 
far higher than during the relatively peaceful '50s, the greatest increase 
occurred during and just after the Vietnam War. For most Americans, the risk of 
violent crime has been on a slight, if erratic, decline in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians and voters will say crime is worse than ever and getting worse 
every day. This is false, but many Americans, projecting a variety of social 
insecurities onto the crime issue, seem captivated by the belief that they live 
during an unprecedented criminal epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, many are legitimately fearful -- especially of the apparent randomness 
of some types of violence. But many Americans now seem in love with the thought 
of being justified in their state of outrage. Research has shown that a 
frightening portion of Americans, when asked in the abstract, are ignorant of 
or even hostile to provisions of the Bill of Rights dealing with criminal 
justice. Others say these provisions are, at best, abstract principles that 
must give way to the unique exigencies of the time.  
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, Yale Law Prof. Bruce A. Ackerman coined the term 
"constitutional moment" to describe those phases in U.S. history where social 
and political forces converged to require fundamental changes in our 
governmental system and principles. 
</P>
<P>
 One such "moment" was the Civil War and its aftermath. The end of legal 
slavery called for major constitutional amendments and federal civil-rights 
legislation that sharply altered the demands that the national government could 
make on the states to ensure legal equality. 
</P>
<P>
 A second "moment" occurred 70 years later, when the traditional relationship 
between Congress and the states seemed impotent to deal with the social 
consequences of a complex national economy never contemplated by the Framers. 
Under the New Deal, a political consensus developed for federal legislation 
drastically expanding Congress' power under the commerce clause, and for a new 
Supreme Court jurisprudence fitting these laws into a coherent constitutional 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for these constitutional restraints is that, even if they seem like 
pedantic inconveniences in particular situations, our judicial system cannot 
easily limit breaches of the constitutional rules to specific cases. For 
example, if the Supreme Court were to permit re-imposing the death penalty on 
the most vicious class of drug kingpins, that decision, however limited at the 
time, could become the precedential rationale for approving the death penalty 
for a host of non-homicide crimes that we long ago realized were devices for 
the most flagrantly arbitrary and racist penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Amendment law has a complex and tortuous history, and many liberals 
believe the Burger and Rehnquist courts have dangerously weakened Fourth 
Amendment protections. But if one basic judicial construction of the Fourth 
Amendment has survived all the political buffeting, it is the rule that unless 
police have a warrant, or specially defined exigencies are proved, they cannot 
enter a person's home even if they have probable cause to believe there is 
evidence of a crime at this particular time and place. (The proposed 
public-housing sweeps do not even meet the probable-cause criterion.) Breach 
that wall and it will be hard to resist legal arguments for military-style 
sweeps of homes on all sorts of government-contrived pretexts, or for highly 
selective sweeps that seem aimed at minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is this concern for unintended consequences limited to judicial precedent. 
However crazy, the "three strikes" laws are probably not unconstitutional under 
current Supreme Court doctrine. But in our complex system of separated and 
partly overlapping governmental powers, legislatures have a bad habit of 
creating messes that someone else has to clean up. As they demonstrate their 
toughness, they bamboozle the public into believing these measures can be had 
without tax increases or without bankruptcy-threatening costs on cities and 
counties that have to foot most of the bill for overlogged criminal-justice 
calendars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, if one area of American life might justify a sense of unique 
exigency, it is the inner city -- where the risk of residents becoming victims 
of criminal violence is wildly disproportionate to the risk that the middle 
classes face everywhere else. But if that urban condition constitutes a 
"constitutional moment," the remedy can hardly be to solve the problem by 
re-empowering the states to impose martial law at the voters' discretion. That 
would not be a constitutional innovation designed to meet changing times as 
much as a terrifying reversion to a world that constitutional government was 
designed to prevent.*

THE NATION; WITH NIXON: 'POLITICS IS GREAT -- EXCEPT FOR PEOPLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John P. Sears, John P. Sears, a political analyst, served as campaign 
manager for Ronald Reagan in 1976 and 1980. He was executive director of the 
Nixon for President Committee in 1967-68. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Richard M. Nixon's stroke on Monday, I've been thinking about him. From 
1965 to 1970, I worked as his political aide and served as executive director 
of the Nixon for President Committee in 1967-68. The picture I have of him is a 
mosaic, an image formed from a series of vignettes often so unexpected they can 
never be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the time when he was looking over the ads with his TV advertising 
group before the 1968 campaign. After thanking them all for their work, he 
turned to some of the rest of us and said, "God, I hope the Russians don't see 
any of that; they'll think I'm an idiot." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the time we were going up the steps of the Mormon Cathedral to see 
the elders of the church. About half way up, he stopped and said, "John?" 
"Yes," I said. "Whatever I say in here, don't you believe a word of it." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the time -- I hadn't worked for him for long -- when we went to a 
fund-raiser. After he had said a few things during a press conference that I 
realized were not wholly reflective of his true beliefs, he approached me in 
the holding room. "John," he said, "you've got to understand one thing." 
"What's that?" I said. "I can say things that if someone else said them, they 
would be lies, but when I say them, nobody believes them, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the time his scheduler, John C. Whitaker, had arranged for him to go 
to church on Sunday in New Hampshire. Nixon asked why this had been scheduled, 
since he was very busy that day. Whitaker responded that the voters in the 
coming primary would expect to see him go to church. Nixon said little, but 
agreed to go. The next week, we were in Wisconsin and Whitaker again scheduled 
church on Sunday. Nixon called Whitaker in and, when given the same reasoning 
for scheduling church, the candidate insisted, "No, John, we did that already." 
</P>
<P>
 There was the time Nixon asked H.R. (Bob) Haldemann to schedule a visit to a 
baseball game at old Griffith Stadium. A few days later, Haldemann said it was 
set for the next week. "Who is playing the Senators?" Nixon asked. "The Boston 
Red Sox," Haldemann replied. "No, no, no," Nixon said, "I'll never carry 
Massachusetts. Wait until the California Angels or the Chicago White Sox come 
to town. Then I'll get some publicity back where it may do me some good!" 
</P>
<P>
 There was the time Nixon was wandering the hotel hallways in Portland, Ore. He 
often didn't sleep well and would venture out into the hallway in his blue 
bathrobe to pace back and forth. It was quite late when he encountered a member 
of his staff going back to his room with a young lady. Without breaking stride, 
without seeming to notice, Nixon said, "Mike, we don't have to get these votes 
one at a time, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the vignettes are funny. In 1966, we visited a congressional 
candidate who had begged Nixon to come. The candidate thought Nixon would help 
him gain support from the more conservative voters in the district. Finally, a 
time was scheduled on a Saturday. But when the visit was announced, the 
moderate voters raised objections. By the time Nixon arrived, the candidate was 
confused about what to do. Before Nixon could say a word, the candidate said he 
wanted to make it clear that Nixon had come of his own volition and in no way 
had been encouraged to do so by the candidate or his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this insulting treatment from a man who had begged him to come, Nixon 
proceeded to go through the litany of how it was much better to vote for a 
Republican than a Democrat, even if you didn't agree entirely with him, because 
it meant a vote on the organization of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked Nixon later why he had put up with this treatment from one so 
undeserving, he replied, "I was afraid his mother was there. Mothers don't 
understand all that happens in politics, they just see their sons being accused 
of something or being criticized. I didn't want to criticize him in front of 
his mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon always remained uneasy with people, didn't enjoy their company and 
didn't expect them to like him -- yet he forced himself, by sheer 
determination, to succeed in a business where being a "people" person is 
considered the first requirement. As he once said to me, "Politics would be a 
helluva good business if it weren't for the goddamned people." I think all 
great people have the capacity to destroy themselves, and I suppose Nixon will 
be remembered most for the destruction of his presidency. But if all we can 
give a man these days are his faults, and none of his good qualities, I wonder 
where we will find people capable of leading the country. 
</P>
<P>
 I happened to be talking with Nixon at the time of the Iran-Contra scandal a 
few years ago. I didn't ask his opinion, but I think he had prepared a 10-15 
minute comment on the subject for all his visitors. At the end of this 
mini-lecture he said, "But Reagan will survive because, when all is said and 
done, he can get up and say, 'I am an idiot and therefore can't be blamed,' and 
everyone will agree." He then looked away for a moment and said, quite 
wistfully, "I never had that option." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that is the difference between great men and others: The great men will 
be blamed and the others escape by hiding in their own inadequacy.*

THE NATION; SENATE ON NOTICE -- IGNORE WOMEN AT YOUR OWN RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Estrich, Susan Estrich, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a law 
professor at USC. She served as campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, eight women members of the House of Representatives, led by 
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and then-Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), 
crossed the Capitol to express their support for Anita F. Hill and their 
concern about how the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee was dealing with her 
claim of sexual harassment. They were denied entrance, blocked at the door of 
the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, nine women members of the House, once again led by Schroeder, again 
crossed to the Senate to express their concern about sexual harassment. This 
time, they got in. This time, they stood behind now-Sen. Boxer as she and the 
six other women members of the U.S. Senate, joining together across partisan 
lines, sought to block the retirement of Naval Chief of Operations Frank B. 
Kelso II at four-star status, because of his role in the Tailhook 
sexual-harassment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a measure of how much things have changed that, notwithstanding the 
opposition of the President, the secretary of defense, the Navy secretary and 
the widely respected chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
notwithstanding that a deal had been struck with Kelso so he would be allowed 
his full pension, the women almost won. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailhook remains a black mark for the military, and with reason. More than 80 
women have come forward to complain they were harassed, sometimes violently, at 
the 1991 naval aviators' convention sponsored by the Tailhook Assn. Kelso was 
the highest-ranking officer at that convention, one of 30 admirals, two 
generals and three reserve generals who attended, and claimed to have seen 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 While a Navy investigation exonerated him, the Navy's own judge, Capt. William 
T. Vest Jr., found that Kelso had been dishonest about his activities at the 
convention and had used his rank to manipulate the investigation to shield 
himself and other senior officers from responsibility. Navy Lt. Paula A. 
Coughlin, who blew the whistle on Tailhook, has since resigned because of the 
harassment she says she has suffered as punishment for coming forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Navy Secretary John H. Dalton tried to dismiss Kelso for his 
failure of leadership in the Tailhook scandal. This year, he apparently made a 
deal with the admiral, promising him the support of the President and civilian 
defense leaders in exchange for his resignation. Plainly, no one thought to 
consult the women members of the Senate before reaching this deal -- even 
though the Senate is required to approve the retirement of all three-star and 
four-star officers. Next time, they will. 
</P>
<P>
 What was striking about Tuesday's 54-43 Senate vote was not only the ability 
of the women members to put aside partisan and ideological differences and find 
common ground on the issue of sexual harassment, but also the reaction of their 
male colleagues. Republican Sen. Arlen C. Specter of Pennsylvania, who led the 
inquisition of Anita Hill, and then nearly lost his seat to an unknown woman 
challenger, voted with the women against Kelso. Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, the 
New York Republican who was one of Clarence Thomas' strongest defenders, was 
one of Kelso's sharpest critics. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, not all the men in the Senate have "gotten it," or are frightened 
enough of the wrath of voters to pretend they have. Had the women triumphed, 
Kelso's annual $84,300 pension would have been reduced by $17,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In opposing that reduction, Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) invoked the hardship 
that would be visited upon the admiral's wife as a result of her husband's 
reduced pension, while Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) argued that no penalties 
should be imposed because Kelso is "a father of two young women who are very 
sensitive of their father's role in this matter." Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), 
another Kelso defender, described the debate as "a completely unpleasant and 
distasteful exercise" -- an emotion no doubt shared by many of his squirming 
male colleagues, not to mention the 80 women who had the misfortune to walk 
down the wrong hotel hallways at the Tailhook convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the ability of the women to muster 43 votes against what was a done 
deal sends a powerful message not only to the U.S. military, but also to the 
political powers in Washington. For all the debate about whether there really 
is a women's vote or whether feminism is a minority movement or if Anita Hill 
changed anything, Tuesday's vote is an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever else might be said of the men of the Senate, they are as politically 
astute a group as any that exists in America. If "white men in the Senate are 
fearful of women," as one Defense Department aide put it, it is because now, 
unlike three years ago, they believe they have reason to be afraid. Women in 
the Senate today have power, because women in this country do. Sexual 
harassment is a potent issue not because the Senate has chosen to make it the 
focus -- there is probably no issue most senators like less -- but because the 
country leaves them no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 No one may have been more uncomfortable during the debate than Sen. Robert W. 
Packwood (R-Ore.), under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee because 
of charges of sexual harassment from some two-dozen women over a span of 20 
years. In a Senate where women have this much power, and sexual harassment is 
so potent an issue, Packwood has reason to be afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges against Packwood range from telling sexually explicit jokes to 
unwanted kissing and grabbing. If true, they establish a troubling pattern of 
offensive conduct where alcohol may have played a role. But Packwood is not 
charged with exchanging jobs for sex, or creating a continuing, abusive 
environment -- the legal standards of sexual harassment. The danger in the 
Packwood case, unlike Kelso's, is not that he will get off with nothing, but 
that he will be burned at the stake, treated as a felon even though he 
committed no crime, and scapegoated for the sexual abuses that have been 
rampant not just in one Senate office, but in every branch of government. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an important line between making someone a symbol and making him a 
scapegoat. What seems reprehensible conduct today was often widely accepted a 
decade ago. Retrospective judgments of sexual behavior have the potential to be 
extremely unfair. And there remains a difference, or there should, between 
offensive conduct and criminal conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not mean that Packwood should be excused. But it does mean that both 
he and his accusers are entitled to fairness and dignity in any proceedings. In 
dealing with the Packwood case, the challenge for the women senators, who 
Tuesday left no doubt that they now have power, is to use that power with the 
sort of wisdom, judiciousness and maturity that was so clearly lacking three 
years ago when their male colleagues were called upon to deal with Anita Hill.*

THE WORLD; PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; SOUTH AFRICA: A NATION AT THE MOMENT OF 
RE-CREATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NOMSA D. DANIELS, Nomsa D. Daniels is the director of the Professional 
Development Program, a management training program for black South Africans. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This Tuesday, I will vote for the first time in my life as a South African 
citizen. No matter that it will occur in New York City instead of on the dusty 
streets of Soweto, where I was born, or Daveyton, where I grew up. I will be 
one of millions of South Africans, black and white, who will, by a simple vote, 
re-create themselves in the image of what is yet to come for the sake of peace 
and national reconciliation. The time for bitterness has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 But I worry about time and memory. Will the flashy campaign slogans that urge 
us to look to the future tempt us to forget the past too quickly? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but the memory must remain. Of those who labored and died, sacrificed and 
marched, protested and fled into exile, died in detention and live with the 
scars of apartheid's brutality. Of the the great leaders of the struggle: Sol 
Plaatje, Chief Albert J. Luthuli, Robert Sobukwe, Steven Biko, Clarence 
Makwetu, Chris Hani and Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 But we must not forget the lesser-known heroes and "sheroes," who quietly and 
valiantly pursued lives of great dignity amid strife. Men like my grandfather 
who, in his 98th year, has lived apartheid and survived. Who after enduring 20 
years of separation from his only son, my father, was overjoyed that I returned 
home with university degrees in hand. For the sake of the two prizes he 
cherished most -- freedom and education -- he felt his suffering was redeemed. 
My grandmother, much to her regret, felt that the price had been too much and 
was not to be consoled. Sadly, she will not cast her first vote, which makes 
mine more precious still. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did it take so long? Driving through the South African countryside, one 
vividly sees the absurdity of apartheid and the inevitability of its demise. 
Two hillsides, one green and manicured with modern houses and a church steeple; 
the other, barren and crammed with tin-roofed shacks. Two stretches of land, 
one deep brown and green, with fat cows peacefully grazing; another blood red 
from erosion, with families struggling to raise food from one-tenth the space. 
One side ablaze with light and warmth; the other dark and cold. That such a 
system could have been maintained for so long bedevils the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But oppression is a funny thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of my relatives champion President Frederick W. de Klerk. Where I see a 
unsettling symbol of the past, they see a reassuring face who will protect them 
and serve their interests in the new South Africa. What evidence they have 
confounds me. That 300 years of history have no bearing on their decision is 
dismaying, but perhaps that is the nature of forgiveness and the true meaning 
of this vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I worry about the future. Whether we will be able to create a country 
that can make us proud so that our elders need never long for the days when the 
white man was in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling in Africa, one hears this again and again from survivors of colonial 
times. How they harken back to the days when everything worked because the 
white man was in charge. Liberation through the ballot will not immediately 
replace the mental chains we have grown comfortable with and scarcely 
recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this unease of spirit that causes us to doubt ourselves and abandon our 
ancient values and culture. We doubt our leaders and damn their lack of 
experience before they have scarcely begun to govern. Theirs is a huge, awesome 
and unenviable task. All the more so because they will be judged by harsher 
standards and scrutinized more closely simply because of their color and the 
past mistakes of black Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 They will, of course, make mistakes, but having worked to nurture a culture of 
democracy, it is our duty to judge them by their deeds, or misdeeds, and ensure 
that they do not abuse our trust. In the months and years to come, they will 
need our patience, our understanding and our support. We must not expect 
miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 As we grope toward this new democracy, we, too, must do our part. We must 
exercise our vote responsibly and be active citizens, fully engaged in the 
development of our country. And we must work to liberate our minds so that our 
children can take pride in their heritage and feel secure that the country is 
theirs to inherit when their time comes. 
</P>
<P>
 And so I will vote. For all those wasted years when the simple right to choose 
who is to govern was denied because of color. For my grandmother and others 
like her who died never knowing the wholeness of family life. For my father and 
thousands of exiles who after 25 years have yet to return home and probably 
never will. For my relatives in the rural Transkei who were artificially 
stripped of their citizenship and relegated to a life of poverty and waste. And 
for my people, that we may begin anew and confront the future knowing where we 
came from and what we must achieve.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; ERNESTO ZEDILLO; CUTTING A NEW PATH THROUGH 
MEXICO'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sergio Munoz 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One month after the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, Mexico's mood is somber. Across the country, black ribbons still 
bedeck the giant billboards that urge voters to support Colosio. But Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon, new candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI, is already in full campaign mode -- address ing workers in 
cavernous halls, walking crowded subway platforms to shake hands, talking with 
constituents in small neighborhood meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo was born in 1951, in Mexico City, but was raised in Mexicali, Baja 
California. Life in that border city was not easy for the Zedillo family. They 
were extremely poor. Yet, young Ernesto excelled in school, and his straight 
A's secured him a college education, then graduate studies at Bradford 
University in Britain and, finally, a doctorate at Yale. Married to Nidia 
Patricia Velazco, Zedillo is the father of five children. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognized as a brilliant economist, Zedillo was chosen by President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari to succeed Colosio -- despite the reservations expressed by 
many political observers about his limited political experience. Zedillo is the 
first to admit his candidacy is the result of tragic circumstances. He has no 
doubt, however, that he is ready to manage a country confronting a severe 
political crisis -- including an armed insurrection in Chiapas and its first 
major political assassination in more than six decades. By choosing Zedillo, 
Salinas sends a powerful message that the economic model the country has 
followed since the presidency of Miguel de la Madrid, in 1982, will remain in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges Zedillo face seem overwhelming. Politically, he must persuade 
his party that he can win the Aug. 21 election. If he does win, he must 
persuade the public that he won fair and square. Then, as president, Zedillo 
wants to reform the justice system, to reassure the country that Mexico will 
remain stable and peaceful. He also must start showing the nation that the time 
to reap the benefits of economic reform -- initiated in 1982, after the 
collapse of oil prices precipitated an economic crisis -- has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 His success will be measured by the rise in per capita income of Mexican 
households. That, in turn, may give Zedillo the support necessary to tackle the 
long-delayed political reform vital to Mexico's modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Mexico seems overwhelmed with mourning due to the assassination of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio. What do you feel about it?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: This is an unknown and dramatic experience we thought only happened in 
other countries -- not here. Mexico has had social peace for many decades. This 
has created an enormous amount of affliction and uncertainty -- but it has also 
generated a sense of national unity and (desire) for peace. This was a crime 
committed not only against one person, but against the nation. We all are hurt 
by it, and we will suffer the consequences of this terrible act for many years 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Many people have criticized the way you handled Colosio's campaign. Is this 
a fair criticism?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The situation in which the campaign evolved in the first three months was 
difficult. Chiapas changed the framework of reference that we had envisioned 
for the campaign. I feel that Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign was good -- not 
because of me, but because he was responsible for giving us the larger themes. 
He was a party man who had managed many political campaigns, and the one he 
made for himself was the best -- given the circumstances in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is this the most critical moment in Mexico's history after the revolution?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Obviously, I feel it is a difficult moment because incidents have 
occurred Sergio Munoz is the editor of Nuestro Tiempo, The Times' weekly 
Spanish-language edition.  
</P>
<P>
 that are new in Mexico's modern history -- the Chiapas question and Colosio's 
assassination. It is atrocious. But I feel that the country's basic structure 
and the people's capacity to resolve problems is enormous. On the contrary, I 
am very optimistic. I believe these incidents reflect the actions of a very 
small minority and shouldn't be used to judge the strength of a country like 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you possess the political experience necessary to lead the country in 
this moment of crisis?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Look, I will let results speak for themselves. I think that I have the 
experience and the capacity to come through for my party. Don't forget that I 
am the first presidential candidate in many years who has been secretary of two 
Cabinet posts (budget and planning and education) in the federal government. 
The truth, in all modesty, is that there is no contender to the republican 
presidency with my experience. The facts speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your platform?  
</P>
<P>
 A: First of all, we Mexicans must recognize our strengths and our capacities 
as well as our problems. Granted that we Mexicans will continue to defend and 
strengthen our sovereignty; this is very important and is not up for 
discussion. But then there are the problems of insecurity and injustice, 
unemployment, insufficient income for the working class, and poverty and 
inequality. My proposal is an integral strategy which will attack these 
problems simultaneously from four different fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding justice and democracy, we should strengthen the validity of the law 
in Mexico -- a problem that ranges from unjust laws to unjust judges. We seek 
to solve the problems regarding the procurement of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 We must preserve and consolidate the stability of our economy. The answer to 
our problems won't come from lack of financial discipline. We won't find it by 
returning to budgetary deficits or to high inflation rates. To achieve economic 
development, it is mandatory to have economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we must improve productivity and efficiency. It is true that we have made 
macroeconomic advances. Now we must work hard at the microeconomic. We have to 
strengthen productivity in the workers and businesses. We must achieve a rapid 
technological actualization; train the workers as well as the companies; 
achieve a competitive condition in the input factors used by the Mexican 
enterprises; continue to streamline all of those aspects that affect the 
investment and the efficiency of workers and companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, but not least, is my social policy. This is what I place the most 
importance upon. We have to invest in people, break the vicious circle of 
poverty and incorporate millions of Mexicans into the modern sectors of the 
economy. This is my simple proposal: to achieve economic growth with a more 
favorable income distribution that will translate into an improved benefit for 
families. The most powerful point in my campaign is the Mexican family's 
well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you win, what would you do differently from the Salinas Administration?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Granted that we will maintain our financial discipline, I feel that, in the 
next few years, we must emphasize the issues of justice and democracy. The 
truth, with all due respect, is that the people, especially the most humble 
people, don't feel the law is on their side. The people fear the police, they 
fear the justice department, the judges . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There are matters of discrimination; I mention the case of women. We have not 
only discriminatory laws against women in Mexico, but even the existing laws 
that protect them are, at times, not carried out. Therefore, we must bring into 
effect what is written in article 4 of the constitution -- that men and women 
are equal in the face of the law.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: But would you tell the people: 'I understand your frustration with the 
economic policies in place since 1982, but you can expect that things will get 
better ' ?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that we have a well-founded belief in Mexico that the sacrifices we 
have made these years, under President Salinas, have allowed us to now have an 
extraordinary base for Mexico to develop in the coming years. So that Mexico 
may grow and, above all, have a structure that will benefit us in the next few 
years with a better distribution of income. 
</P>
<P>
 We must emphasize microeconomics, as it has not been done these past few years 
but which will be the challenge in the upcoming years. We have the economic 
possibilities of having a much more ambitious social policy than what we have 
had up until today -- if we do not erase our advances. We cannot afford to go 
back to populism, paternalism or statism. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you see Chiapas now?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There has been great progress since January. I was very encouraged by 
Manuel Camacho's call last week in response to the attack on a military post. 
It seems there has been a positive response and soon dialogue will be 
re-established. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the problem will be peacefully resolved, because there is good faith 
on the part of the government to reach a civilized solution, and now we see 
there is also good faith on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some of the criticism heard about your party is there is no accountability 
-- that there are many electoral irregularities and yet nobody is ever punished 
publicly.  
</P>
<P>
 A: There was a flaw in our legislation. The crimes related to electoral issues 
were not aptly classified nor were the penalties. There now exists a 
classification of electoral crimes and the stipulation of the penalties in the 
penal code. Now we must make sure that all those who break the law receive the 
corresponding penalty. Now I feel we have a modern electoral framework. We have 
electoral institutions that are extremely refined in their procedures.  
</P>
<P>
 We are on the way to another electoral reform. The constitution was just 
amended to guarantee the autonomy of the electoral institutions and, in the 
coming days, Congress will surely be discussing additional reforms . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your party is divided.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Says who? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The entire world.  
</P>
<P>
 A: That is not true! Only a few people who are outside of my party say so. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But I have heard criticism by the PRI old guard against President Salinas 
and by the young generation of Priistas, for whom "business-as-usual" is a 
repugnant practice. Don't you believe that political reform in Mexico lags way 
behind?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, now you are mixing several topics. In the first place, I don't 
believe my party is divided. Being a broad center party -- a characteristic 
unknown to any other party here in Mexico -- it embraces a diversity of 
opinions. It is a very myopic commentary to say, because there are different 
opinions among the members of my party, that the party is divided. No. 
Diversity of opinions and the construction of a consensus are precisely what we 
Priistas strive for. 
</P>
<P>
 The diversity of opinions is one manifestation of the political strength of 
our party. We are not a monolithic, authoritarian party where all must share 
the same opinion. Those who claim that our party is divided, and point to our 
problems, should concern themselves with their own party. The matters of the 
PRI are the concern of Priistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, you don't think that political reform has been forgotten in Mexico?  
</P>
<P>
 A: President Salinas has made an extraordinary effort to modernize the country 
on all grounds. In the political realm lie all the facts. There were three 
great electoral reforms during his term. He has promoted democracy from the 
grass roots of society by calling to all Mexicans for an enormous social 
participation. Democracy transcends the electoral process. He has promoted a 
larger democratization of the country. He has made his best effort, given the 
circumstances. But it is clear that we must still work hard to achieve the kind 
of democracy that will appease the Mexican people's call for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the PRI have to separate from the government?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, the constitution is clear; it establishes the government's functions 
and what defines a political party: public- interest organizations to promote 
the political participation of the citizens. Therefore, what we need to do is 
follow through with what the constitution has already established. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you see the future between Mexico and the United States under the 
North American Free Trade Agreement?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I hope to have a relationship of mutual respect. I hope they realize that 
Mexico has firm and clear foreign-policy principles and that those principles 
are necessary to uphold an amicable and cooperative relationship. In order for 
the free-trade agreement to function, we need to work at it. We must dispel 
this environment of uncertainty that has developed in these months. I am sure 
this will be dissipated soon and that both countries can take advantage of the 
immense opportunities that the free-trade agreement promises.*

 RESIDENTS RATTLED; WARMER WEATHER MEANS AN EARLY SNAKE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An uninvited guest slipped into the living room of William and Jan Brankin's 
Simi Valley home the other day: a baby Southern Pacific rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first my husband thought the dog had pooped on the carpet, because that's 
what it looked like, all curled up," Jan Brankin said. "He was about to kick 
the dog when he realized it was a snake -- a rattlesnake at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Such encounters are occurring across Ventura County and Southern California 
this spring as warmer temperatures draw snakes into the back yards -- and 
sometimes the homes -- of people living near the deserts and foothills of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Between April and October, depending on the weather, animal control officers 
and firefighters respond to thousands of snake sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first rush of snakes are starting to show up," said Bruce Richards of the 
Los Angeles County animal regulation office in Agoura Hills, which also handles 
calls from Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell people to expect it because it's going to happen," he said. "It may 
be only one rattlesnake, but that may be the one that gets you." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Brankin, the mother of a 3-year-old boy and baby-sitter to two other 
toddlers, said the children had played in the back yard most of the afternoon 
before the reptile wound its way into the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little worrying, especially with small children around," said Brankin, 
who is eight months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're encroaching on his land as much as he's encroaching on ours," she 
said. "Just a few years ago, this whole area was barren. We'll be keeping a 
closer eye on the yard from now on, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Using thick leather riding gloves, William Brankin herded the snake into a 
sealed bucket until he and his wife relocated the wayward serpent to the hills 
above their Wood Ranch subdivision. Officials say the better course would have 
been to call in an expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Already this season -- the breeding period for rattlesnakes -- Richards and 
his colleagues have responded to 11 rattlesnake calls in the hills around 
Thousand Oaks. They've answered another two dozen calls throughout their 
region, which stretches from Chatsworth to Topanga and west to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two rattlers were reported Wednesday in a man's driveway in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said they looked like they were dancing, but I know what they were doing 
and it wasn't dancing," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County fire crews have answered 21 calls in other parts of the county, 
and Ventura County animal regulation has investigated at least a dozen more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason we have this onslaught so far in Thousand Oaks is because the 
temperatures have been so summer-like," Richards said. "That sends a signal to 
the rattlesnakes to come out from where they hibernate." 
</P>
<P>
 California is home to four general varieties of snakes: rattlers, gopher, 
garter and king snakes. The non-venomous garter, gopher and king snakes account 
for most of the 120 species that make up the state's four general varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattlesnakes -- representing six different species -- are the only venomous 
snakes in California. The most populous by far is the Southern Pacific rattler, 
which grows to about 6 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers in Caspers Park east of San Juan Capistrano already have reported 
several snake sightings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "People usually see them along the trails, but they avoid them and the snakes 
slither back into the brush," park official Gina Drury said. "We've had several 
sightings, but no bites." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that animals are more often the victims of snakebites than human 
beings because they are both curious and ignorant about the reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a riding horse died within 30 minutes of being bitten by a 
rattlesnake at O'Neill Regional Park in Orange County. The woman astride the 
animal told officials that the snake seemed to attack the horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very aggressive rattlesnake," park ranger Ron Slimm said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 One emergency-room physician said he hopes this season is nothing like a year 
ago, when heavy rains increased the rat and mice populations -- favorite foods 
of many snakes -- and brought him a host of rattlesnake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a real run last year," said Philip Macniel, an attending physician at 
the UC Irvine Medical Center emergency room. "At one point, we had four (bite 
victims) in the course of three weeks. One of them was particularly ill and had 
to be put on life-support." 
</P>
<P>
 Snake sightings typically occur in the deserts and foothills -- and in the 
housing developments that have sprung up next to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our calls are in Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and Simi Valley," said Sandi 
Wells of the Ventura County Fire Department. "They're hot, dry valleys and we 
have a fairly large population of people in those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said just one rattlesnake bite has been reported so far this season: a 
mountain biker in the Rincon hills north of Ventura who sat in a patch of tall 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rattlers really seem to be aggressive when they're disturbed," Wells 
said. "People should be careful when they're hiking and stick to well-used 
trails." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific rattlers, however, do not limit themselves to undeveloped 
open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Burbank Animal Shelter routinely answer snake-sighting calls 
in the hills above the city. When they do, one officer said, they don't bother 
trying to relocate the snake. Instead, they hack it to death with a hoe or 
shovel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We respond immediately to the call, and the snake is dispatched on the spot," 
said Senior Animal Control Officer Harold Hagler, who said the season so far 
has been somewhat slow, with only a handful of reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "These mountains have all kinds of hikers," Hagler said. "You can't relocate a 
poisonous reptile to where a citizen could get bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura County fire officials feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's determined to be a rattlesnake, we kill it on the spot," said Capt. 
Ken Maffei. "We're not going to jeopardize our people by playing with 
rattlesnakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Maffei said warm weather has resulted in numerous snake sightings in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a tremendous amount of rain this year, so we expect to see 
them coming out of the hills to get water," said Maffei, who is stationed in 
Moorpark. "I took one out of a bathtub last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people say snakes have gotten a bad rap. Ventura County animal regulation 
officials have begun an education program designed to teach people that snakes 
are beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole purpose is to keep snakes alive," said Kathy Jenks, the director of 
the Ventura County Animal Regulation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about snakes that people are afraid of inherently," she 
said. "But we're trying to show people that snakes have a place in Ventura 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Musone, Jenks' full-time education officer, gives lectures on the 
benefits of snakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snakes are killed strictly out of fear and ignorance," he told a group of 
youngsters at Peach Hill School in Moorpark recently during one of the scores 
of snake-awareness programs he conducts each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their numbers are seriously depleted more and more because we're building on 
the hills and the hinterlands," he said. "But snakes are super beneficial, 
because rattlesnakes kill gophers and other burrowing rodents." 
</P>
<P>
 There are major, easily discernible differences between venomous and 
non-venomous snakes, Musone says. 
</P>
<P>
 Venomous snakes have triangular heads, thicker bodies, blunt tails, pushed-up 
noses and Loreal pits -- small holes between the nostrils and eyes that are 
used to smell. Non-venomous snakes have none of those characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Musone tells children -- and anyone else who will listen -- that without the 
serpents, rodent populations would swell to even larger numbers and mudslides 
would become more frequent because of the holes dug by rats and mice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to reach the youth now so the future generation will be a little 
less harsh on animals that are misunderstood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Clark understands just one thing about rattlesnakes: They bite. While 
hiking in Matilija Canyon near Ojai last summer, she stepped on a slumbering, 
6-foot rattler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got very sick from it. I was in the hospital for 10 days," said Clark, who 
owns a hair salon in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still not over it completely, not really," she said. "But as for the 
physical part of it, it was three months before I got better. They gave me 
antivenin, but that didn't work too well." 
</P>
<P>
 On a quiet hilltop above Simi Valley, nearly 24 hours after finding the infant 
rattler lazing on her living room carpet, Jan Brankin and her husband loosened 
the lid from their bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 They had kept the foot-long snake overnight until William Brankin could decide 
exactly where to release it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just slithered away in the long grass and went off," Jan Brankin said. "It 
was quite relieved to get out after being cooped up so long."

DESTINATION: UTAH; THE CAPITAL OF; ROCK AND ROLL; WHEELING UP, DOWN AND AROUND 
THE UNIQUE RED ROCK FORMATIONS SURROUNDING MOAB, UTAH, THE MOUNTAIN BIKER'S 
MECCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Before the phrase "sprockethead" entered the local vocabulary, before Bill 
Groff started selling 10,000 cyclist's water bottles a year, and long before 
anyone dreamed that this town would become the mountain biking capital of North 
America, Moab was already an improbable place. 
</P>
<P>
 It sat here in the southeastern corner of Utah, surrounded by dinosaur tracks, 
Anasazi petroglyphs and billions of tons of sandstone, baked, warped, exploded 
and decayed into a desert-scape of thousand-foot fins, blood-red mesas, 
unengineered arches, gritty winds, gnarled junipers and a deep, damp, crooked 
gash in the earth known as the Colorado River. Beneath its crusty skin, the 
place was stranger still: Uranium lay here in enormous quantities. Forty years 
ago, when the leaders of the American nuclear industry went looking for the 
power to do unearthly things, they ended up digging under these rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Utah uranium isn't in demand the way it once was, and for the last five 
years Moab's future has been rolling in on knobby rubber tires. Moab is where 
mountain bikers migrate to careen down the inclines of the 10-mile Slickrock 
Trail, to glimpse the snow-capped La Sal Mountains, to explore hundreds of 
miles of rock-strewn old mining trails, to torture $2,000 bicycles. To the 
north sprawls Arches National Park. To the southwest, Canyonlands National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this!" huffs Dina Kilgo, 25, a vacationing teacher from Fairfield, 
Calif., pumping her pedals toward the nearby summit of Poison Spider Mesa on a 
hot, dry afternoon. To get here, almost 5,000 feet above sea level and 1,000 
feet above the trail head, the helmeted Kilgo has negotiated seven miles of 
path that Todd Campbell, guidebook author and bike-path sage of Moab, has 
described as "gonzo abusive." She is ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 There are thousands more like her. Bicycle traffic on Slickrock, the area's 
most popular trail, will probably pass 100,000 riders this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the area's trails were cut decades ago by off-road vehicles on land 
now controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or the National 
Forest Service. Jeeps and motorcycles can legally share most of these trails -- 
a "Jeep safari" early this month drew more than 1,300 four-wheelers to local 
trails -- but on most days, bicycles now outnumber motorized vehicles 100 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In town, bicycle culture burgeons. In a community with 7,000 residents and a 
Main Street fewer than 10 blocks long, three bike shops thrive, each with a 
steaming espresso machine out front. The taxicabs feature roof racks -- the 
better to haul you and your bike to a trail head outside town. Even crime 
statistics -- puny by any urbanite's standard -- reflect the rise of the 
bicycle. Police chief Alan West counted just 14 car thefts in town last year, 
but 41 stolen bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrieving those bikes, by the way, is not always difficult.  
</P>
<P>
 "You see one of our local low-lifes riding a $5,000 bike," says West, "and you 
go, 'Aha!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some days, the volume of strolling and coasting visitors makes the place look 
like one big Patagonia fashion show. Yet so far, Moab's accommodations remain 
relatively modest -- there are no tennis resorts here, and only one golf course 
-- and prices remain far lower than those in this country's most famous red 
rock desert retreat, Sedona. Most hotel rooms run $35-$85. 
</P>
<P>
 There are drawbacks. Self-consciously quaint Western art galleries are 
shouldering aside the optometrist and insurance agent's offices along Main 
Street. The first McDonald's arrived 3 1/2 years ago, along with a sign 
proclaiming itself Moab's "other arches." (That sign vanished after repeated 
vandal attacks.) Almost everyone is nervous about Moab's newfound popularity, 
from Park Service veterans who worry about wilderness purity to the core of 
longtime locals who still prefer four-wheeling to biking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never, ever lived in an area that has meant so much to me, in my 
bones," says Deb Nester, 44, who moved to Moab from Colorado four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really overwhelmed. Everyone should stay home," says Jim Stiles, 
publisher of the monthly Canyon Country Zephyr, a committed hiker who refuses 
to take up mountain biking. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-generation Moabite Cindy Winters tells me amazing tales of how some of 
the town's home-grown youths used to pass leisure hours four-wheeling drunk by 
moonlight on the skid-marked rock formation they call Lion's Back. 
</P>
<P>
 No, she allows, that wasn't wise. But she's bothered more, it seems, by these 
new bicycle people and their manners. Winters leads me out to the parking lot 
behind the Moab Times-Independent's offices to show off her four-wheel-drive 
truck, a high-riding behemoth of a vehicle with the following, ah, cautionary 
message displayed above the grille: SPROCKET TERROR . 
</P>
<P>
 "Makes people think twice about darting out in front of you," she says dryly. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue sky, red rocks. A brilliant, chilly April morning. Six of us are jouncing 
out of town in a four-wheel-drive Ford toward the Gemini Bridges trail. Our 
bikes (most of them rented for $20-$25 per day) are clipped to the roof, and 
trail guide Maggie Wilson of Kaibab Bike Tours is slurping highly potent coffee 
and briefing us on the 14-mile ride ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The landscape is familiar: Cinematic characters Indiana Jones and Thelma and 
Louise have all been seen here, as has John Wayne in various films. It was here 
30 years ago that the Chevrolet people plopped one of their new cars down on 
top of Castle Rock. But we're thinking about two-wheeled exploits now. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your body and your mind say Whoa! listen to that," Wilson is saying. 
"Otherwise . . . it's Biff City." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm no expert on Utah geography, but I know I don't want to go there. Wilson 
goes on with advice on braking (use the rear brakes more than the front) and 
etiquette. We should stick to the well-trod trail, thereby avoiding the 
cryptobiotic crust that coats much of these hills and directly or indirectly 
sustains virtually all plant and animal life in the desert. (The best biking 
and recreation maps of the area are published by Latitude 40 in two parts, Moab 
East and Moab West, and are widely available in town, usually for about $8 
each.) Like many of Moab's year-round cycle people, Wilson has a background in 
environmentalism -- biology bachelor's degree, UC Santa Cruz -- and choice 
words for riders who stray from trails. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I strap on my helmet, poke toes into the bike stirrups, aim downhill, and 
start operating my jackhammer . . . that is, riding my bike, which, despite the 
fancy shock absorbers up front, feels like a piece of heavy machinery striking 
concrete rubble. The trick of downhill mountain-biking, experts say, is to 
absorb those blows with one's arms, keep one's center of gravity low and toward 
the rear wheel, and balance the bike in a sort of controlled forward hurdle. 
Heading uphill, the key is keeping your legs churning, conserving momentum in 
gear-shifting, and guiding your tires toward ground that allows maximum 
traction. 
</P>
<P>
 And if bumpy biking doesn't agree with you, there are rides on smoother 
trails. Or you can ditch the bike and go for a hike, or sign up with one of the 
outfitters running rafts on the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the Gemini Bridges ride, I explore Hurrah Pass, another 14-mile 
route for beginners. The trail flanks the Colorado River and peels off 
alongside Kane Creek, climbing, winding and swooping through shade and sun. 
"Physically easy/technically easy," according to Campbell's guide. Fine by me. 
Here a rider can round a corner, lean into a hard climb, and find his world 
reduced to the path below, the sky above, the immense canyon walls on either 
side, and that merciful arrangement of chain and sprocket that cyclists call 
"granny gear." Time slows down, and all you hear is the desert rustling and the 
wind racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the time and energy, I'd ride the 16.5-mile Monitor and Merrimac trail 
next, then maybe the 25.4-mile Back of Behind, or the 25.2-mile Courthouse 
Loop. A rider could stay weeks and not run out of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But it only makes sense to venture out on these trails when temperatures are 
reasonable. In July and August, highs reach between 95 and 100 degrees. In 
winter, temperatures dip below freezing. April and October bring the best 
weather for biking (though April also brings throngs of students on spring 
break and ski bums just released from seasonal jobs at Colorado's resorts). 
Every year the season semi-officially ends with a Fat Tire Festival and 
Halloween party. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Edward Abbey once described Utah's canyon land as "naked, monolithic, 
austere and unadorned as the sculpture of the moon . . . clean, pure, totally 
useless, quite unprofitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey, the unofficial bard of these parts, died in 1989. But even in 1968, 
when he published those words in the book "Desert Solitaire," Abbey knew he was 
wishfully thinking about profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 After centuries of on-and-off occupation by the Anasazi and Ute, and by Mormon 
missionaries (the original Moab, named in the Old Testament, was an ancient 
kingdom in what is now Jordan), it was prospecting that built Moab into a 
full-fledged city in the late 19th Century. The minerals most in demand were 
radium (derived from carnotite ore), later followed by vanadium (used as a 
hardening agent for steel) and, once the worldwide run on nuclear weaponry 
began, uranium. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest local winner in the arms race was a young miner named Charlie 
Steen who, working a claim he called Mi Vida, struck a massive supply of 
uranium in 1952. Within a few years, he grossed more than $60 million, built a 
fancy house on a hilltop, and from fancy parties on his deck, watched Moab's 
population grow to more than 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The good days stretched into years, and Moabites got used to both working and 
playing around their remarkable rocks. In 1969, a motorcyclist named Dick 
Wilson persuaded the BLM to mark off an off-road sandstone trail near the city 
dump ("America's Most Scenic Dump," a sign announces these days). Slickrock, it 
was called. Since the path was on sandstone, the BLM decided, it appeared not 
to threaten soil and plant resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the early 1980s the mining industry collapsed, the town's population 
fell by 20%, the unemployment rate reached 19.5%. And the seeds of the new Moab 
were quietly and frugally sown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Bill and Robin Groff, whose family had worked for years in the mining 
business, somehow decided a bike shop might fly here, in a mining town on the 
verge of drying up and blowing away. In 1983, with $4,000 in start-up money, 
they opened their small shop, Rim Cyclery, concentrating on road cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 Word spread, and, gradually, mountain bikers effectively took over the 
Slickrock trail. Now Rim Cyclery's inventory fills 8,000 square feet. A new 
visitor center stands at Center and Main streets, with fancy xeriscaping 
outside and dozens of pamphlets from outfitters, bike shops and hotels inside. 
And Charlie Steen's fancy house on the hill is the Mi Vida restaurant, having 
been converted in 1974 after Steen encountered tax troubles and a run of bad 
mining luck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bikes may be lighter than Jeeps, but they still make tracks. And the habits of 
their riders have authorities groping for new ways to protect the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex VanHemert, outdoor recreation planner for the BLM in Moab, says riders on 
Slickrock and other popular trails could be assessed day-use fees as soon as 
next spring, and is hoping for added staffing to discourage riders from 
straying off trails. (The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, staunchest 
conservation group in the region, has opposed motorized off-road vehicles in 
many areas, but has stopped short of calling for broad mountain-biking bans.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the human waste problem. In heavily used camping areas such as 
Slickrock and along the Colorado River, budget-conscious campers have been 
setting up their tents for free on BLM land, but failing to properly disposing 
of their solid waste. (Depending on the area, the BLM requires that campers 
either bring portable waste containers or bury waste six inches deep and 300 
feet from the nearest water source.) Portable toilets and camping fees have 
been added in some heavily used areas, but BLM officials and activists agree 
Moab needs more camping restrictions or responsible, enlightened campers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the old Atlas uranium mill, idle for a decade, lies crumbled a few 
miles from town. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is holding hearings over 
where to dispose of the controversial rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 It may look unearthly, but Moab ain't heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of tension here," affirms Campbell. The trail-guide author, 
32, arrived not quite 11 years ago as an environmental studies major from UC 
Santa Barbara. Since then, he has led bike tours, worked for the BLM, 
collaborated on a trail and written a biker's guidebook. Now he's promoting a 
May 30 reggae concert that he hopes will raise money for local wilderness 
education efforts, and fretting more and more about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six-hundred-year-old juniper trees are getting pulled down and burned for 
campfires," he says, and the town and trails are getting awfully busy for him. 
In five years, he says, he may not be here. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cliffs keep coming up rosy every morning, and the trails beckon. 
Before he leaves, Campbell has a vexing problem to solve: 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you go after Moab?" GUIDEBOOK: The Moab Cycle 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Moab is about a 12-hour drive from Los Angeles, roughly 700 
miles northeast via interstates 10, 15 and 70, and then south on either U.S. 
191 or Utah 128. The Moab airport gets weekday commuter flights via Alpine Air 
from Salt Lake City. The airport in Grand Junction, Colo., 100 miles east of 
Moab, gets daily flights from commuter lines in Denver, Salt Lake City and 
Phoenix. Cheapest restricted round trip fares for connecting flights from Los 
Angeles begin at $302 (Continental and America West) and $307 (United and 
Delta). Rental cars and four-wheel-drive vehicles are available at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: There are now more than 1,000 hotel and motel rooms in the Moab 
area, plus scores of B&B, guest-house and vacation apartment operations, and 
camping at Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service sites. I stayed 
at the Moab Valley Inn (711 S. Main St., Moab, Utah 84532; telephone 
800-831-6622 or 801-259-4419), which was clean and efficient, but which bans 
bicycles from inside spaces and doesn't bother to provide any bicycle storage. 
With double rooms renting at $77 nightly, they should. A typical middle-range 
lodging is the Sunset Motel (also known as the Arches Inn, 41 West 100 North, 
Moab, Utah 84532; tel. 801-259-5191), where most double rooms usually run $65 
nightly. Cheapest non-camping option is the Lazy Lizard International Hostel 
(1213 S. Highway 191, Moab, Utah 84532; tel. 801-259-6057), a dormitory 
arrangement that holds up to 55 people sharing nine showers and eight toilets. 
Rate: $7 per night. Bookings at most area lodgings can be made through 
Moab/Canyonlands Central Reservations (92 E. Center St., Suite 1, Moab, Utah 
84532; tel. 800-748-4386 or 801-259-5125). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Center Cafe (92 E. Center St.; tel. 259-4295) specializes in 
contemporary American cuisine. Most entrees: $9.95-$12.95. Mi Vida Restaurant 
(900 N. Highway 191; tel. 259-7146) offers views and a menu heavy on steak, 
seafood and pasta. Entrees: $9.95-$17.95. The Grand Old Ranch House (1266 N. 
Highway 191; tel. 259-5753), an antique-stuffed 1896 home, offers standard 
American and German specialties. Dinner entrees run $8.95-$17.95. The Fat City 
Smokehouse (36 South 100 West; tel. 259-4302) features both Texas-style 
barbecue and several vegetarian dishes, and is a good bet for lunch. Main 
dishes: $4-$14.50. The town microbrewery, and a hot spot with mountain bikers, 
is Eddie McStiff's Restaurant and Brew Pub (57 S. Main St.; tel. 259-2337). 
Entrees: $7.50-$13. Pints: $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to find bicycle gear: Moab's big three bike shops, each selling and 
renting bikes and accessories, are Rim Cyclery (94 West 1st North; tel. 
801-259-5333), Poison Spider Bicycles (497 N. Main St.; tel. 800-635-1792 or 
801-259-7882) and Kaibab Mountain/Desert Bike Tours (391 S. Main St.; tel. 
800-451-1133 or 801-259-7423). 
</P>
<P>
 What to read: "Above and Beyond Slickrock" (by Todd Campbell, 282 pages, 
$16.95, published by Moab Outabouts, P.O. Box 314, Moab, Utah 84532) is a 
detailed, map-filled compendium of 40 rides around Moab. The book is available 
in bookstores and bike shops throughout Moab.

<P>
 If you rent cars regularly, you've already noticed that rates are rising. But 
that's just one of three major trends reshaping the rental-car business these 
days -- and consumers have much to gain by taking note of all three. 
</P>
<P>
 While prices are rising, safety features are growing more common, and 
rental-car companies are getting more choosy about whom they'll trust with a 
car. Each of these trends is likely to deepen. Here's a quick look at each 
issue: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rental rates are rising because U.S. car makers are, after a long dry spell, 
selling more cars to the public. During the years when retail sales were slow, 
the overstocked Detroit car makers (who own hefty portions of most of the 
nation's largest rental-car companies) sold large numbers of new vehicles to 
rental firms at bargain prices, then bought them back as used cars. But since 
1992, car makers have been raising their sale prices and cutting their buy-back 
prices, leaving rental firms with cost increases estimated as high as 30% per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The rental firms have saved some money by keeping their fleets in circulation 
longer; industry officials say the average rental car these days probably has 
6,000-8,000 miles on its odometer, up from 4,000-6,000 two years ago. But the 
new higher dealer prices made raising rental rates a priority, and Hertz, Avis 
and their smaller siblings are now telling anyone who will listen that for the 
last decade, rental-car rates have been unnaturally low. 
</P>
<P>
 After initial faltering in the move to bump up rates -- pricing in the 
industry is highly competitive -- Hertz last fall pushed its prices up roughly 
10%, then backed off a little as its competitors followed only part way. Then 
two months ago, Hertz announced another hike of 5%-15%. Others have followed, 
and more such moves are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing you can be sure of," says Geoffrey Corbett, executive vice 
president for sales and marketing for National InterRent. As the next year or 
two progress, rental-car rates "will not be cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 * Spurred by demand from a security-minded public, and further energized by 
the recent rash of crimes against Florida tourists in rental cars, rental-car 
companies are rapidly adding safety features to their fleets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hertz 1993 fleet (the largest in the country, numbering 230,000 
vehicles), 30% of vehicles had anti-lock brakes, 59% had driver-side air bags 
and 29% had passenger-side air bags. A year later, 49% had anti-lock brakes, 
82% had driver-side air bags and 68% had passenger-side air bags. Hertz, which 
offers 14,000 cars with installed cellular phones in 52 U.S. cities, this month 
also announced that drivers in those cars can now make free pre-programmed 
calls to 911 (for law-enforcement emergency service) or 611 (for Hertz 
emergency road service). 
</P>
<P>
 Among National's cars, the percentage of driver-side air bags rose from 41% to 
82% in the last year, and a variety of other features -- power windows, power 
locks and anti-lock brakes among them -- rose from various figures to 99%. 
</P>
<P>
 Avis, meanwhile, this month began a two-month trial at New York's La Guardia 
Airport in which about 30 cars are being equipped with communications devices 
that will allow law-enforcement authorites, once alerted by a call, to locate 
and track the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rental car companies are starting to look carefully at the driving records 
of prospective renters -- mostly in New York and Florida, but also in 
California. This trend began in 1992, when Hertz started using computer 
communications systems to check New York Department of Motor Vehicles records 
before handing over keys to renters. The major rental companies have now 
instituted similar programs in New York and Florida and occasionally elsewhere, 
with varying rules about what disqualifies someone as a renter. (Among the 
convictions that disqualify a Hertz customer: drunk driving or vehicle theft in 
the past 36 months.) Hertz reports that fewer than 1% of prospective renters 
are denied cars, but some programs had much higher numbers in early weeks of 
their programs. A Budget spokeswoman reports that company's "decline" rate in 
New York started at 16% in late 1992, and quickly fell to 5%-7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials expect the list of scrutinized states to grow longer. Hertz 
and Budget started checking the records of California driver's license holders 
in October, 1993. Here's an important warning for renters uncertain about their 
records: In several programs, including Hertz's, rental agents are supposed to 
mention the DMV checks when they accept your reservation. But they won't 
actually do the checking until you appear at a counter to collect keys. If the 
computer kicks up damning information then, you're in a strange city, carless. 
(Company officials say that methodology is necessary because 20% of all 
reservations turn out to be no-shows, and that their companies can't afford to 
bear the cost of checking records of customers who may never arrive. They also 
note that drivers could rack up offenses after making their reservations but 
before appearing to pick up their rental cars.)

WEEKEND ESCAPE: BAJA CALIFORNIA; ROSARITO REVERIE; HE HOLED UP AT THIS SEASIDE 
HOTEL, WHERE THE OCEAN VIEWS ARE LONG AND THE R&R EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Mott is a regular contributor to the Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of my adult life, one of the nomadic notions that hovered near the 
top of my to-do list -- somewhere below a monthlong golfing orgy in Scotland 
and a bit above a banzai run to the Gilroy Garlic Festival -- was a weekend 
holed up in the Rosarito Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from simply liking the sound of the name, I thought the idea seemed 
worthwhile for several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The hotel is probably the best-known lodging in all of Baja norte , with a 
history that goes back to the 1920s, when there was nothing in that 
neighborhood of any note except the hotel; 
</P>
<P>
 -- A bunch of old Hollywood types used to sneak out of town to stay there in 
relative anonymity: Orson Welles, Lana Turner, Mickey Rooney, Rita Hayworth, 
among others; 
</P>
<P>
 -- The air is clear, the beach is inviting and the view of the Coronado 
Islands is lovely; 
</P>
<P>
 -- They make great street-side tacos in town; 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can go as a couple and get romantic, as a group and get crazy or on 
your own -- as I did -- and happily vegetate and relax in depth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The tropical drink list in one of the hotel bars -- the Beachcomber -- is 
about the size of the local phone book and, 
</P>
<P>
 -- There's a certain romance about getting not just out of town for the 
weekend, but out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 From my home in Santa Ana, it's about a two-hour drive to the trademark gabled 
arch entryway of the hotel, including a quick stop in San Ysidro for Mexican 
auto insurance, which isn't mandatory but can save you immense headaches in the 
event of a south-of-the-border fender-bender.  
</P>
<P>
 First, however, came a lunch stop at the peaceful early-19th-Century Casa de 
Bandini in San Diego's Old Town for a quick enchilada and a margarita at 
fountain-side in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive from there to Rosarito isn't exactly a straight shot; you have to 
snake your way around the edge of downtown Tijuana and follow the signs that 
say "Rosarito-Ensenada Cuota." This is the toll road, beautifully constructed 
and paved, that will get you to Rosarito in about 20 minutes. It's worth every 
penny of the $2.30 toll. The alternative is the "libre" road that can be hell 
on your shocks and nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at the southern end of Boulevard Benito Juarez in the approximately 
two-mile-long town of Rosarito, the Rosarito Beach Hotel is the planet around 
which orbits many of the more tourist-friendly businesses and restaurants in 
the neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 The hotel wears its age gracefully, if not perfectly. The tile work on the 
walls and floors of the lobby and adjacent areas remains lovely, and the 
restaurants and bars are comfortable and informal, but the moderately priced 
rooms are no more glamorous than a decent motel's. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if you book a room with an ocean view (mine was on the fifth floor of 
the newer tower section), the attraction of the spot becomes refreshingly 
obvious. There is a long, long, long and clear ocean view directly to the west, 
broken only by a small seal rock just offshore and, to the north, the rolling 
Coronado Islands. The late afternoon sun is dazzlingly bright and the sunsets 
are often blazingly spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 They blaze less brightly through the tinted glass of the Beachcomber, a small 
rotunda that extends past the swimming pool and overlooks the beach below. It 
was there I set up a kind of sunset-watching headquarters both afternoons of my 
stay. As the friendly piano player pried saloon tunes out of the tinny baby 
grand, I and a couple dozen other lazy people -- mostly snowbirds fleeing 
frozen northern weather and college kids getting a jump on spring break -- 
relaxed in depth as we watched the waiters fetch coconut after coconut filled 
with potent coco locos and champagne glasses brimming with margaritas. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside on the grass next to the pool, the air reeked of cocoa butter as the 
collegiate crowd ignored the basics of 1990s dermatology and fried themselves 
to a ritual crisp. And down on the beach, tattered, aging rental horses 
trundled tourists back and forth while the more speed-addicted opted for 
three-wheel all-terrain vehicles (also for rent). 
</P>
<P>
 But all this purposeful activity runs counter to the true purpose of a weekend 
at the Rosarito Beach Hotel: shameless sloth. The hotel has its own spa 
(massages, facials, saunas and the like), French restaurant (Chabert's, located 
in the adjacent old mansion that was originally the residence of the hotel's 
founder and his wife), a pair of bars (there's a second, more cozy one just off 
the lobby), racquetball courts, tennis courts, two pools, whirlpools and a 
miniature golf course. People cocoon here. 
</P>
<P>
 I had made several tours of the shops and restaurants along Juarez on previous 
trips (particularly to the open-air artisans' mercado behind a row of tiny 
curio shops), so this time I decided to stray from the hotel only occasionally. 
Still, on Saturday morning, I couldn't resist the impulse to drive a few miles 
south on the free road to the Calafia resort. I had seen pictures of the 
Calafia restaurant and bar, snugly fitted into the rocky face of a cliff 
overlooking a large cove, and the reality lived up to the publicity. In the 
late morning the bar was nearly deserted -- the result, perhaps, of a hard rain 
the night before that kept many people at home -- but the view of the sea below 
was inspiring, the best I'd seen on the entire coast. It became even more so 
when the sun came out and turned the water from slate gray to azure blue. And 
the Bloody Marys were top-notch. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the hotel for lunch, I decided to wander out to the end of the parking 
lot and around the corner to the Mi Casita street-side taco stand on Juarez. 
There, the infectiously cheery man with the gap-toothed grin behind the counter 
served up four perfectly constructed and spiced tacos carne asada and an 
ice-cold Tecate to wash them down with. I've always believed that the finest 
lunch in Rosarito Beach can be had at any number of such stands on Juarez and 
Mi Casita did nothing to change my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that tacos are the only game in town. My two favorite restaurants on the 
boulevard are Ortega's, which specializes in lobster and regional dishes, and 
El Nido, an inviting, intimate, dark-wood-and-brick place a couple blocks from 
the hotel that makes glorious carne asada plates.  
</P>
<P>
 I spent the early part of the evening on my balcony, listening to Ravel on the 
Walkman and dreaming of the pepper steak I planned to order at Chabert's later. 
It turned out to be a bit of a disappointment, but the mansion was impressive, 
particularly the big mirrors with the leering wood dragons twining around them 
that overlooked one of the dining rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Relaxation, particularly sleep, comes easy here. The sound of the surf sees to 
that. I chalked up two of the best nights' sleep I've had in months. And two 
perfect breakfasts. A perfect breakfast at the Rosarito Beach Hotel, as far as 
I'm concerned, always includes the sliced papaya, toast, orange juice (freshly 
squeezed), bacon and a small bit of hash browns. This for about $5. There was 
also a handsome buffet brunch, but it was nearly check-out time and I had 18 
holes of golf at the Real del Mar golf course (nine miles north of the hotel) 
on the morning agenda. The greens are rough and you can lose a lot of balls 
here, but if you play for fun you can actually leave feeling relaxed and are 
therefore better able to endure the wait at the border crossing.  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't hit another traffic slow-down until I pulled into Mission Viejo. But 
the temptation to turn around and barricade myself in the Rosarito Beach Hotel 
for another week was almost overwhelming. Budget for One

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: AIRLINE MENUS ARE LIGHTENING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Often criticized as greasy, fat-laden, salty and, in general, not particularly 
healthy, airline food is evolving. In a random poll, most airline officials 
said their carriers had made menu changes recently . . . changes aimed at 
improving the nutritional character of meals aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 The beverage cart is changing, too, as passengers order fewer hard liquors and 
turn instead to wine, beer and nonalcoholic beverages, officials report.  
</P>
<P>
 "The passenger wants healthier, lighter fare," said Greg Witter of Alaska 
Airlines. That became evident, he said, from the comment cards, surveys and 
looking at what comes back on the meal trays. 
</P>
<P>
 One airline, American, has decided to make dieting easier by offering Weight 
Watchers entrees on lunch and dinner flights. Other airlines are offering more 
options for vegetarians and customers looking for reduced-fat alternatives, by 
carrying meatless meals as standard -- not special-order -- fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a sampling of what's new at mealtime for health-conscious passengers: 
</P>
<P>
 Recent menu changes at Alaska Airlines are the result of inspections conducted 
at the "Office of Garbology," the unofficial name for the place meal trays land 
after a flight, Chairman Raymond J. Vecci told readers of the February issue of 
his airline's in-flight magazine. Inspectors noticed that heavier foods were 
not being eaten, nor were the snacks served between traditional meals, he said. 
Menus and food serving schedules were changed accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result is main-cabin entrees such as tortellini in pesto with shrimp, and 
salmon grilled with tomatoes, onions and cilantro," Vecci said. "In first 
class, new entrees include grilled turkey on a bed of cucumbers and boiled 
shrimp on marinated vegetables." Breakfast choices now include low-fat cereal 
and low-fat milk. 
</P>
<P>
 At America West, less beef and more fish is the trend and beginning next 
month, the airline is adding mahi mahi, swordfish and tuna to first-class meals 
while at the same time using fewer sauces, according to spokesman Mike 
Mitchell. To make room for the menu changes, entrees such as beef fajitas are 
being abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines is now offering on-demand Weight Watchers fat- and 
calorie-controlled entrees on lunch and dinner flights on about half of their 
domestic flights, as part of a several-month test, said spokesman Joe Crawley. 
(Advance special ordering isn't necessary.) If this option proves popular, 
Crawley said, the meals will be available by summer on all domestic flights. 
Breakfast offerings already include cereal, fruit and other low-fat foods, 
Crawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 For travelers with special nutritional needs or preferences, Continental 
Airlines is offering a long list of meal options, including lacto-free and 
gluten-free menus, in addition to standard vegetarian meals emphasizing grains 
and beans. "Over the past eight months, we have also been providing meals with 
less fat and calories," said spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney. For snacks, packages of 
carrots, a new choice, are popular. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northwest Airlines, main cabin "A La Carte" food service was introduced 
last year, allowing passengers to select foods buffet-style from a seat-side 
serving cart and, thus, to better control the amount they eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the new options are low-fat, however. This means that passengers 
interested in cutting fat and calories must be nutrition-savvy enough to make 
the best selections. But for them, the options include salad with grilled 
chicken and no- or reduced-fat dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last six months on Virgin Atlantic Airways, vegetarian entrees, such as 
spinach and cauliflower curry, have been served in first-class sections without 
advance ordering. "For other meals, we are trying to emphasize herb sauce 
instead of heavier gravies," said spokeswoman Elizabeth Hlinko. "One choice is 
mixed leaf and artichoke salad with creamy yogurt or tomato-vinaigrette 
dressing. We also offer several vegetable choices with meals and more fish 
entrees." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottled water consumption is up, partly due, she speculated, to passengers' 
awareness that alcoholic beverages can worsen jet lag.

 THE SPELL OF THE VIENNA WOODS: Inspiration and Influence From Beethoven to 
Kafka and SWITZERLAND: The Smart Traveler's Guide to Zurich, Basel, and Geneva, 
both by Paul Hofmann (Henry Holt, $22.50 each hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 A longtime foreign correspondent for the New York Times, Rome-based Paul 
Hofmann has recently been turning out thoughtful, accessible travel books in 
the educated guidebook idiom. ("Roma: The Smart Traveler's Guide to the Eternal 
City" was his last before these two.) What's unusual about them is that they 
offer where-to-go/what-to-do material -- the sort of thing usually published in 
durable paperback format -- in hardcover form. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmann writes well -- economically, clearly, with a tone that is friendly 
without being overly familiar -- and he obviously knows his material. But I'm 
not sure that his travel tips -- the sort of information that is, by its very 
nature, ephemeral -- deserve so serious a treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 His "Switzerland," for instance, is full of savvy recommendations for hotels, 
restaurants and amusements in the three cities it covers -- and he does a good 
job, I think, of convincing readers that the least-known of the three, Basel, 
is in fact an extraordinarily appealing place, well worth a visit.  
</P>
<P>
 But does the book have literary merits beyond its clarity and attractive tone? 
Will it be of use to anyone five years from now, when hotels and restaurants 
have changed ownership or closed and prices have changed? And if not, well, why 
a hardcover? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Spell of the Vienna Woods" is something else again. Here we find not 
Hofmann the guide maker, but Hofmann the charming, urbane chronicler. Perhaps 
it helps that he is Austrian-born himself. It certainly helps that what he 
attempts to give his readers in this case is not guidebook fare at all, but 
glimpses into the heart of a great European city and its surroundings. History, 
personality and humor are interwoven effortlessly in this book's pages; it is a 
pleasure to read. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were traveling to Austria, I would certainly stick it in my suitcase as a 
guide to the eternal pleasures of the place. Of course, I'd also take along the 
latest edition of some good paperback guide to the country, for the 
ever-changing particulars.

 SHAKER HERITAGE GUIDEBOOK: Exploring the Historic Sites, Museums & Collections 
by Stuart Murray (Golden Hill Press, $15.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Through an elegantly shaped but unadorned archway, two brooms, one normal and 
the other child-size, lean against a wall. On the near side of the arch, two 
clean-lined ladder-back chairs hang upside down on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect is positively surrealistic. But this is not surrealism: This is a 
Shaker interior at the Hancock Shaker Village in Hancock, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shakers, originally called "Shaking Quakers," were a group of British 
religious dissidents who became the most successful of the utopian religious 
movements in this country. By the middle of this century, the group had all but 
died out -- but the pure, enviably confident simplicity of Shaker design has 
become famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaker buildings, museums and collections can be seen today from Maine to 
Indiana to Florida. This sympathetic, impeccably researched guide to such 
Shaker sites, combines the usual practical information (addresses, opening 
hours, etc.) with solid historical lore. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most surprisingly, "Shaker Heritage Guidebook" reveals there is still 
one eight-person Shaker community operating on traditional principles at 
Sabbathday Lake in New Gloucester, Me. -- complete with museum, shop and guided 
tours.

DESTINATION: CARIBBEAN; ST. CROIX SLEEPERS; FROM HISTORIC PLANTATION HOUSES TO 
MOTELS WITH VIEWS, INN STYLES VARY ON THIS U.S. VIRGIN ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Flashy discos off crowded hotel lobbies just aren't our thing. We didn't want 
to have to take an elevator to the beach. And we liked the idea of our host 
knowing us by name. So when my friend Stanley and I decided to take a break 
from a magazine story I was researching on another Caribbean island last 
summer, we tried to find a place that was beautiful, serene and that wouldn't 
put us in the poorhouse. We chose a small beach hotel on the pastoral island of 
St. Croix -- a place we found has some of the most pleasant bed & breakfasts, 
inns and petite hotels in the West Indies. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the trio that make up the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Croix is far 
more laid back than busy St. Thomas but not quite as quiet as undeveloped St. 
John. Separated by miles of rolling countryside studded with old sugar mills, 
two waterfront towns grace the island. On the northeast coast, handsome 
18th-Century Christiansted is where most of the action is. Covered sidewalks 
with Danish archways -- reminders that the island was a Danish possession for 
nearly 200 years prior to 1917 -- crisscross a lively downtown area filled with 
duty-free shops and restaurants. The adjacent harbor is speckled with colorful 
sailboats and yachts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the west, Victorian gingerbread-trimmed houses fill the drowsy town of 
Frederiksted. It is this town that has had to work hardest to recover from 
Hurricane Hugo, which spread its wrath across the island in September, 1989. 
Until the storm destroyed its pier, Frederiksted was St. Croix's busy cruise 
port. The year before Hugo hit, ships docked some 170 times. But with the new 
pier still not complete, cruise ships were making only half as many visits, a 
tourism official told me.  
</P>
<P>
 As our plane swooped down over the island, we could see that St. Croix was 
virtually back to its old self. Yet the traces of hurricane damage remained. 
Here and there, battered houses had been abandoned. Jungle vegetation grew up 
through gaping holes where roofs and walls once were. On the east end of the 
island, three popular hotels hadn't reopened. And other repairs were proceeding 
in a deliberate manner. During the trip, we visited the seaside home of a 
friend celebrating post-hurricane restorations that had just been completed -- 
four years after Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer who has ventured into the Caribbean dozens of times, both for work 
and relaxation, I have friends who are familiar with the local lodging scene. 
So I asked them to name their favorite small hotels and B & Bs among St. 
Croix's 22 or so. (There are also about six major hotels.) From their picks, I 
visited 10. A few were near the shore and another was on a sandy beach; still 
another was nestled in the hills. The accommodations I liked most could hardly 
have been more varied . . . in appearance as well as location. Yet they all 
provided easy access to sailing, snorkeling, scuba diving, windsurfing, tennis, 
golf, restaurants and night life. And each had its charms. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends who live on St. Croix recommended that we stay at Hibiscus Beach, a 
38-room hotel along a pretty cove enclosed by coral reefs. Guest rooms in the 
two-story buildings were plain but comfortable and all faced the water. Our 
ground floor room had a gorgeous view of the sand and the electric blue-green 
Caribbean. When we return, though, we'll book a second-floor room. The beach 
was right outside our glass doors, but so were public walkways, making privacy 
and sunlight mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 We donned our complimentary snorkeling gear, provided by the hotel, and dove 
into the underworld, where we were immediately surrounded by colorful fish. 
Since the beach was so nice, we didn't even make it to the pool that overlooks 
the ocean and the open-air, waterfront dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three hotels along this pleasant sandy stretch, Hibiscus Beach, which 
was built after Hugo, was the least expensive. It was also less elaborate than 
the others. There was no lobby and everything was open-air, including the front 
desk and the restaurant. But I liked the laid-back style and also appreciated 
the hotel's proximity to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Christiansted was only a 15-minute drive away, so dining out was hassle-free. 
Although the town boasts a slew of good restaurants, we couldn't resist eating 
twice in the shady garden setting of Annabelle's Tea Room, where we feasted on 
delicious Puerto Rican, Cuban and local dishes while a jazz singer performed. 
</P>
<P>
 When we weren't stretched out on the hotel's tranquil beach or cooling off in 
the water, we explored the island, introducing ourselves to the other inns, B & 
Bs and small hotels by stopping by for drinks, to go horseback riding, to eat a 
meal or, in one case, to look up the friend of a friend who was staying at one. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those I explored, my favorite was Hilty House. Up a winding road, a 
five-minute drive west of Christiansted, the charming seven-unit B & B was 
built in 1966 as a private home on the ruins of a rum distillery dating back to 
the 1700s. As soon as we entered the huge living/dining room, we understood why 
this B & B is the site of so many local parties and weddings. The floor was 
fashioned of colorful hand-painted tiles from Portugal and Italy, set off by 
stark white walls and sunshine that streamed through the skylights. A cavernous 
fireplace dominated the room. Sliding glass doors led to a spacious pool deck. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cozy library, family photos reminded us that this is very much the 
owners' home. Each of the four bedrooms and three cottages was individually 
decorated -- some rooms containing European antiques -- and the floors in most 
were tiled in dramatic designs. Ornate wrought-iron lighting fixtures with 
hand-blown glass appeared throughout the house. Venetian chandeliers 
illuminated some of the bathrooms, all of them private, though one was next 
door to a bedroom rather than in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the appeal was in the personal attention -- as little or as much as 
guests wanted -- from owners Hugh and Jacquie Hoare-Ward who opened the B & B 
in 1991. When I asked about a sweet fragrance in the air, Jacquie explained 
that it was potpourri she makes from roses and jasmine she gathers in the 
surrounding gardens. She also bakes her own breads aily, and serves jams from 
tamarind, mango and papaya that she makes, along with fresh tropical fruit 
grown on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hill, in the town of Christiansted, Pink Fancy B & B seemed to appeal 
to travelers who like to be close to shopping and other tourist activities. It 
was also only a short walk from the dock where a ferry departs to tiny Buck 
Island, which has an excellent beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooms varied substantially in size, shape and location but all 14 were 
colorfully decorated with tropical patterns and rattan. They bore evocative 
names such as "Upper Love" (one of the nicest rooms), "Morning Star" and 
"Humbug." 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in an old Danish building arranged on three levels, Pink Fancy had a 
terra-cotta-tiled patio surrounding the swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 We relaxed in one of the wide hammocks on an upper deck overlooking the pool, 
taking in the view of the harbor over the colorful rooftops. Served poolside, 
continental breakfast was mundane (Danish coffee, tea and toast) but it was 
included in the price. 
</P>
<P>
 I also liked the small hotel called The Waves at Cane Bay, both because it 
overlooked a dramatic rocky coast with crashing surf and because the rooms had 
an indoor/outdoor feeling. The back wall of each was made of glass doors that 
slid out of sight, leaving the room completely open to the screened balcony 
that overlooked the Caribbean. Many divers gravitate to The Waves, according to 
co-owner Kevin Ryan, who is also the hotel's scuba instructor. It's a 
two-minute walk to sandy Cane Bay Beach, a good spot for both scuba diving and 
snorkeling. This 12-room hotel also seemed appealing to families because all 
the rooms had kitchens. Bordered by coral and backed by a seawall, the 
semi-natural swimming pool was filled with multihued fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The focal point of family-run Sprat Hall Plantation, about a five-minute drive 
from the center of Frederiksted, was a handsome white French colonial great 
house, dating to 1650. Guest quarters were also found in four buildings 
constructed in the 1970s, but the nicest were two rooms in the historic, 
two-story great house. Here, four-poster canopied beds, Victorian chairs and 
Oriental rugs were part of the decor. By comparison, some of the other rooms 
were surprisingly ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Sprat Hall's past reads like a history lesson of St. Croix. It 
was a cotton and indigo plantation under the French, then a sugar cane 
plantation when the Danish were in power. Production didn't end here until the 
turn of the century, making this the last working sugar cane plantation on St. 
Croix. 
</P>
<P>
 The inn is owned by Joyce and Jim Hurd and run by their daughter Judy Young 
and her husband Mark Young. But the house and plantation has belonged to the 
family since 1926, when it was a cattle ranch and country home. In 1946, it was 
turned into a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the 15 units have kitchenettes, guests don't have to cook. 
The complimentary continental breakfast -- offered only to guests who don't 
have kitchenettes -- included freshly baked banana muffins along with fruits 
such as soursop, guava, tangerine and grapefruit, all grown on the property. 
Lunch was served on the neighboring beach. Guests dressed for dinner in the 
elegant great house dining room, where one of the specialties was coconut beef. 
</P>
<P>
 There were nearly 60 horses on the property so many of the guests were 
equestrians who mounted up for a relaxing ride through the lush forest. But 
vacationers could also climb aboard an old carriage, go bird watching around 
the expansive grounds, grab a bicycle or drink in the glorious sunsets. 
</P>
<P>
 We're glad that the Caribbean has no dearth of high-rise hotels and crowded 
beaches. Let the hordes go there, leaving the smaller, quieter corners for us.

 Safety tips: Like other islands in the Caribbean, St. Croix is stepping up 
security measures in an effort to protect tourists from crime. Many hotels 
employ security guards and instruct front desk employees to advise tourists 
about safe and unsafe areas, according to the St. Croix Hotel & Tourism Assn., 
which has just printed a safety pamphlet that is distributed to hotel and B & B 
guests. The pamphlet advises common-sense precautions, such as not carrying 
vast amounts of cash or wearing flashy jewelry, locking hotel room and car 
doors and avoiding isolated beaches and unlit areas at night. The Hotel & Motel 
Assn. also recommends the safest areas to visit. For safety and tourism 
information, call (800) 524-2026 or (809) 773-7117.

 It rained last night and the ground is too wet for treading into the rose 
fields. And so I am sitting with half a dozen friends on a cafe balcony in the 
town of Kazanluk -- an important center for the world's rose oil industry -- 
watching rose-decorated people trickle into the square below. They come in ones 
and twos, then in whole groups, wearing traditional costumes of red and gold; 
some of the men in tall furry hats and green vests, everyone with roses tucked 
into their hair or their button holes or with wreaths of roses around their 
necks. Folk dancers and musicians begin to appear, mixing with shoppers 
returning from the market; one man carries a sack full of ducklings, another 
holds a fine red rooster by its feet. A little boy dangling a strap of cowbells 
from his shoulder makes a strange melody as he moves along the street below. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the square is full. It seems the whole town has turned out, carrying 
bouquets of roses or single blossoms. Trumpets blast. Men wearing tall 
headdresses decorated with bits of mirror and clanging bells dance around in a 
ritual to drive out evil spirits. A band playing sheepskin bagpipes heralds the 
arrival of the rose queen and her retinue. The strong, sweet smell of roses 
wafts up to the balcony as young people spray scent into the crowd from large 
canisters. 
</P>
<P>
 For a week each spring (this year, May 30-June 6) villages and towns in 
Bulgaria's Rose Valley celebrate the country's most famous crop with rose 
festivals like the one here today, jumping from village to town on different 
days. I first heard of these festivals about 10 years ago, when I was travel 
editor for the European Stars & Stripes newspaper. As a fan of folklore and 
traditional costumes, I dreamed of exploring the Rose Valley. It also seemed a 
good opportunity to travel around the country whose economy is influenced to a 
great extent by something as lovely as a rose. 
</P>
<P>
 From my home in Frankfurt, I hopped a plane to the capital of Sofia and took a 
bus to Plovdiv, in the center of the country and at the southern edge of the 
Rose Valley. From there I made my way around the region, branching out into the 
countryside by bus and car. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a general plan: After seeing the Kazanluk rose festival -- the most 
famous of the celebrations -- I wanted to go to the Black Sea coast, then on to 
visit one of the ancient rock monasteries and, finally, to one of the National 
Revival-style monasteries that are typical of Bulgaria. Several of each type of 
monastery are scattered around the country and I was able to do all of this, if 
only briefly, covering more than 800 miles in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 I visited the Alaja rock monastery near the Black Sea coast and stopped at 
Rila Monastery on my trip to the southwest corner of Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was first of all in search of roses, so I started with the rose fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrow Rose Valley, about 20 miles long and five miles wide, nestles in 
the shadow of the Balkan and Sredna Gora mountains. Its rolling landscape is 
verdant at this time of year, dotted with fields of red and white roses that 
stretch like a checkerboard as far as the eye can see. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature's red and rose colors are adopted in the dress worn during the 
festivals. Tradition is treasured by those who live in the Rose Valley, and the 
Kazanluk festival is a wonderful opportunity to get acquainted with typical 
Bulgarian song and dance, as well as to admire the intricate costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration continues for a week, but most guests remain for about two 
days -- just the right amount of time to take in an afternoon folklore 
performance, to accompany the locals into the rose fields and pluck a bouquet 
of roses and to see the Rose Museum, which traces the history of rose-growing 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets of Kazanluk are crowded from mid-morning until late at night as 
guests from Japan, Germany and the United States rub shoulders with Bulgarian 
visitors from other parts of the country and with local people in costume. The 
Bulgarians are invariably friendly and polite to strangers and they patiently 
explain time and again to every guest who asks how roses are intertwined with 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The attar roses -- the red Rosa damascena and the white Rosa alba are the 
primary breeds used now -- were brought from Persia to this valley about 300 
years ago. The area now known as the Rose Valley, whose main towns are Kazanluk 
and Karlovo, produces some of the world's best rose oil for perfume . . . the 
best, at least, according to the admittedly partial Bulgarians. Yet even 
discriminating French perfume makers seem to approve of its quality. A 
spokesman for a major French perfume producer, Fragonard, told me that 
Bulgarian rose oil is equal in quality to French, which is, to him of course, 
the best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Bulgarian method of processing rose oil is the decisive 
factor in maintaining that quality. Rose oil is distilled by the same method as 
brandy. It takes three tons of pink roses or five tons of white to produce one 
liter (about a quart) of rose oil, which sells for $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of this -- both aesthetically and economically -- cannot be 
overstated. For years, while all other Eastern Bloc currencies were "soft," the 
Bulgarian lev was traded on world money markets because its rose oil was used 
in the world's leading fragrances. The oil is exported to 30 countries, with 
France the No. 1 buyer. And there is still hope that rose oil will help lift 
Bulgaria from the economic mire engulfing so much of Eastern Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 Once considered one of the most hard-line of Moscow's allies, Bulgaria is 
making the change from communism to capitalism with so little fuss that the 
West hardly takes notice. Yet this tiny country -- about the size of Ohio -- 
deserves closer acquaintance. As the place where two cultures -- the Christian 
Orthodox and the Muslim -- collided, it is a perfect combination of the exotic 
and the familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists find familiar vegetables on the table in delicious guises, and 
Bulgarian wines are an "in" secret among connoisseurs throughout Europe, 
especially in England. Bulgarian music (similar to, but less shrill than 
Turkish, and made famous in the U.S. through tours and records by the Bulgarian 
Stage Women's Choir) shares billing with Western rock at local night clubs. And 
prices are low: Hotel rooms begin at about $18 a night; a substantial dinner 
can be had for as little as $4. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rose, modern Bulgaria is layer upon layer of beauty, just as it is 
layers of some of the world's great civilizations: Thracian, Greek, Celtic, 
Roman, Slavic, Byzantine. The Rose Valley is a superb place to explore the 
epochs. Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second-largest city and once its capital, has been 
a settlement for perhaps 8,000 years -- making it older than Rome, Athens or 
Constantinople. Plovdiv's restored Roman theater is today a favorite spot for 
open-air performances, and its Old Town is a showcase of 18th- and 19th-Century 
Bulgarian National Revival architecture. Ornate merchants' houses have been 
turned into museums revealing that life here has for centuries been a 
juxtaposition of East and West: bright-cushioned Turkish divans under the 
windows, baroque wood carvings decorating the ceilings. Traditional craftsmen 
have set up shop along Rue Stramna (Steep Street) in the Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thracian tomb from the 3rd Century BC, decorated with frescoes and filled 
with priceless golden objects, was unearthed in 1944 at Kazanluk. And like the 
caves at Lascaux in France, a copy had to be made to protect the original from 
visitors. There are in the immediate vicinity 37 tumuli, or hillocks marking 
the ancient burial sites of kings and nobles. However, to see what has been 
called by archeologists the oldest worked gold in the world, one must go to 
Varna on Bulgaria's Black Sea coast. Much of that gold, dating to around 4,000 
BC, was found entombed without a corpse, perhaps buried in rites symbolizing 
the end of a monarch's reign. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Bulgaria, however, lies in its monasteries -- 120 of them -- 
which preserved the national culture during the Turkish rule that began in 1396 
and ended only in 1878. The pride and joy is beautiful Rila Monastery, ancient 
seat of religion and learning, nestled in the country's highest mountains about 
75 miles south of Sofia. 
</P>
<P>
 The monastery itself has burned many times; the buildings standing today are a 
fine example of 19th-Century Bulgarian National Revival architecture. Rambling 
white stone arches on the lower levels support lacy wooden balconies, giving 
the impression that they are built of light and air. The church, crouching low 
under its Orthodox dome, appears aglow with frescoes and wall paintings, inside 
and out, on every inch of paint-able surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The monastery has 300 cells (although only 12 monks are in residence) and a 
number of "guest rooms," now preserved as examples of folk art. They were 
furnished by cities throughout Bulgaria for their citizen-pilgrims (locals who 
made pilgrimages to the monastery), and each city tried to outdo the other in 
showing off its prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 From Rila Monastery it is a short drive south to Blagoevgrad, a lively city 
where the American University in Bulgaria has, ironically, set up in former 
Communist Party headquarters, a center for teaching business and economics. 
Farther along the road I discovered the spa town of Sandanski, an excellent 
overnight stop, not just for its good hotels but for its relaxed atmosphere -- 
the type that characterizes spa towns throughout southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Most tourists go to the Black Sea coast for sun, sand and water that is 
shallow and safe enough for children, but during my short stay I had no time to 
lie in the sun. Local acquaintances and I poked around the Alaja rock 
monastery, which is burrowed into the limestone cliffs near Albena, at the 
northern end of the coast. Its 13th-Century murals are in such poor condition 
that they have been closed off, but we were able to explore the two-story 
hermit cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the northern end of the coast, Golden Sands was the first Bulgarian 
resort to attract international tourists and still is one of the most popular. 
However, I found Druzhba next door to be quieter and more elegant. Nearby Varna 
has an aquarium and dolphin pool in its Marine Gardens, as well as a recently 
excavated aeneolithic (the transition period between the Neolithic and Bronze 
ages) necropolis and an elaborate network of Roman baths. It is a bustling city 
with a naval academy and a port for passenger ships connecting to Yalta, 
Istanbul and Athens. 
</P>
<P>
 The central-coast resort town of Sunny Beach has the country's best beach and 
is popular with groups, but Nesebur peninsula lies just two miles away, a 
delight for anyone who wants to explore history as I do and get to know the 
local population by staying in a private home instead of a hotel. This is easy 
to arrange. I simply asked someone on the street where I could find a hotel. 
Invariably either he or she rented rooms at home or knew someone who did. Once 
there were 40 Christian churches here, but now only a few examples remain from 
the 5th, 10th, 13th and 17th centuries, scattered among the National Revival 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But my time was getting short, so I hurried back to Sofia, far to the west. 
This city of churches, museums, art galleries, opera and theater is taking on a 
new sheen of neon and shop windows and its bustling atmosphere is far removed 
from the peaceful rose fields in the country's center. 
</P>
<P>
 I visited the imposing Alexander Nevski Memorial Cathedral, standing at the 
city's highest point, in delightful contrast to the tiny, half-buried Sveta 
Petka Samarjiiska church that is overshadowed by the TsUM department store. I 
explored the oldest preserved building in Sofia, the 4th-Century church Sveti 
Georgi, sitting incongruously in the courtyard of the Balkan Sheraton Hotel, 
which is built in the Stalinist "wedding cake" style -- a reminder of an era 
that is being firmly laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 My flight back home was booked, so I didn't have time for the concerts and art 
exhibitions, or for shopping for handwoven carpets. Those things I left for 
next time. My golden rule of travel is never "finish" a country, but find 
something that will bring you back. Someday, when I catch the scent of the 
roses again, I will recall the Rose Valley -- and then I will return to 
Bulgaria. GUIDEBOOK: Bulgaria Basics 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Lufthansa flies nonstop from LAX to Frankfurt and then nonstop 
Frankfurt to Sofia. Lowest round-trip fares start at about $1,060. Other 
carriers connect to Balkan Airlines in various cities, including New York, 
London and Paris. Lowest round-trip fares start at about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours: Balkan Holidays has several Bulgarian tours, including a Valley of the 
Roses tour during the rose festival in early June. One-week tour includes 
visits to Rose Valley, Sofia, Plovdiv, Koprivshtitsa and Bachkovo Monastery; 
$1,143 per person, double occupancy, includes round-trip flight from New York; 
add-on round-trip fare from Los Angeles is $418. The company also offers 
seven-to-10-day package tours of Bulgaria, as well as city tours for 
independent travelers; tel. (212) 573-5530. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: Western chain hotels are good but may be expensive. Among them 
are Sheraton, Novotel and Summit International. Facilities outside major 
tourist centers may be modest. Rooms in private homes can be arranged through 
Balkan Holidays or when you arrive in Bulgaria through central booking bureaus 
at tourist offices, usually in train stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around: Rental cars are available, both from private local firms and 
international chains such as Hertz. I also used buses and found them to be 
inexpensive, efficient and convenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Visas: American citizens staying less than a month do not require visas but 
for stays of a 30 days or more visas can be obtained from the Embassy of 
Bulgaria, attn. consular office, 1621 22nd St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008; 
(202) 483-5885. (There is no Bulgarian Tourist Office in the U.S.)

HIKING: WOODLAND HILLS: VIEW OF THE VALLEY AT NATURE'S EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not much open space remains on the south rim of the San Fernando Valley. True, 
there are the Santa Monica Mountains, but they sometimes seem a world apart, 
more connected to the ocean side than to the valley side of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's with some relief that the eye travels over the San Fernando Valley's 
south rim and finds a little green space that isn't a golf course. That green 
space is Serrania Ridge, a pocket of parkland on the suburban edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrania Ridge, which is part of the hills of Woodland Hills, is also called 
Woodland Ridge. (Woodland Hills itself was formerly known as Girard, named 
after its subdivider, Victor Girard.) The Santa Monica Mountains rise directly 
behind Serrania Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers can contemplate these and other facts of geography as they climb the 
ridge in search of far-reaching valley views. At the hiker's feet is almost 
endless suburbia, 275 square miles of green lawns, swimming pools, lush trees 
and shrubs, office buildings and shopping malls -- a strange combination of 
tidiness and unseemliness. On clear days, more mountains loom large and 
dramatic on the far side of the valley: the San Gabriel Mountains, the Simi 
Hills and the majestic Los Padres National Forest peaks behind Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 On days when visibility is less than superb, this hike makes a nice, 
freeway-close, after-work workout. The hike begins at Serrania Avenue Park, a 
city park that's circled by a long, paved walkway popular with local 
dog-walkers and fitness walkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From the Ventura Freeway (U.S. 101) in Woodland 
Hills, exit on De Soto Avenue and head south. After crossing Ventura Boulevard, 
the avenue continues as Serrania. Proceed one mile to Serrania Avenue Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Join the unsigned path along the far eastern edge of the park and 
begin climbing south. The steep trail roller-coasters up and down -- mostly up 
-- offering one rise and then another from which to partake of the view. 
</P>
<P>
 West of the path are Woodland Hills Country Club and the hillside suburbs of 
Calabasas and Hidden Hills. Just east are -- or once were -- the Chalk Hills; 
the hills have been so graded, contoured, terraced and engineered for haciendas 
that it's difficult to discern what was once there. 
</P>
<P>
 Your path climbs some more and eventually finds Mulholland Drive. Mulholland, 
a dirt thoroughfare at this point, leads a couple of miles west to Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard and a couple of miles east to the back side of Topanga State 
Park. To reach the very top of Serrania Ridge, cross Mulholland and follow a 
steep, unsigned trail that begins on the other side. Serrania Ridge Trail 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Serrania Avenue Park, Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Distance: 2 1/2 miles round trip, with 500-foot elevation gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrain: Brushy hills on rim of San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights: Views of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Degree of Difficulty: Easy-moderate.

BACKPACK AND BUDGET; CHEAPER CHOICES FOR BUS TRAVELERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North American bus services that offer a low-cost option to long-distance 
coach lines now reach from New York to California, Alaska to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer will be the first full season for the East Coast Explorer, a 
backpackers' bus service between New York, Boston and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not the cheapest (nor) the fastest," said Larry Lustig, operator of the 
14-passenger Explorer, "but we provide an economical and educational 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Four mornings a week, the Explorer picks up passengers -- who have made 
advance reservations -- at their hostels or hotels. Eight to 10 hours are spent 
driving to the destination, with stops at interesting sites and economical 
restaurants en route. Schedules are flexible depending upon weather and special 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 The Explorer travels from New York to Boston every Monday, returning on 
Tuesday, for $29 each way; and from New York to Washington every Thursday, 
returning on Friday, for $32. 
</P>
<P>
 En route to Boston, the bus typically visits Gillette Castle State Park and 
the Mystic Pizza restaurant in southern Connecticut, as well as Newport, R.I. 
Returning to New York, there are stops in the Pioneer Valley, Mass., and 
Dinosaur State Park, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 En route to Washington, the Explorer visits the Amish people of Pennsylvania's 
Lancaster County; on the return to New York, there are stops at Newcastle, 
Del., and Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no age restrictions and only two rules: Passengers must wear seat 
belts, and no smoking is permitted on board. Stops are made about every 90 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The service, which started April 1, is scheduled to continue until late 
November. For further details, contact Wanderlustig, 245 Eighth Ave., New York 
10011. Reservations can be made by calling (718) 694-9667 or (800) 610-2680.

 San Francisco-based Green Tortoise Adventure Travel offers multi-day budget 
bus service on routes up and down the West Coast and across the United States. 
Tours take in the Grand Canyon, Yosemite National Park, Alaska and Mexico's 
Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Tortoise isn't for everyone. Organizers warn passengers that they may be 
disappointed if they want such things as daily showers or private berths. 
Delays and itinerary changes are not only possible, they are expected.  
</P>
<P>
 Green Tortoise trips are described as "self-service vacations" oriented toward 
hiking and swimming at remote natural spots. Passengers sleep in the bus, on 
sheets fitted over thick foam mattresses placed on window-high platforms and 
bunks. Everyone contributes to a food kitty; meals are usually fully vegetarian 
or meatless. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer's trips include seven nine-day round-trips to the Grand Canyon 
from San Francisco via Bakersfield; cost is $360, including food.  
</P>
<P>
 Also leaving from San Francisco, are a pair of 30-day round-trips to Alaska, 
departing June 29 and July 29, for $1,750; and several six-day tours of 
Northern California's redwoods and parks in July, August and September for 
$250.  
</P>
<P>
 Coast-to-coast trips from San Francisco to New York or Boston range from 10 to 
14 days, and cost from $350-$430, including the food kitty. There are also 
commuter trips between Los Angeles and Seattle for $69. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in November, Baja trips of nine, 14 and 16 days -- originating in 
San Francisco, with pickups in Los Angeles and San Diego -- start at $300. 
</P>
<P>
 For further details, contact Green Tortoise Adventure Travel, 494 Broadway, 
San Francisco 94133; tel. (800) 227-4766 or (415) 956-7500.

 Seniors Abroad, an international home-stay program for adults over 50, has 
been so successful that all but one of its 1994 programs has sold out. A 26-day 
trip to Japan is scheduled from Oct. 5-31 with visits to three different parts 
of the Asian island nation, including Tokyo. The trip begins with a three-day 
orientation and hotel stay, followed by home stays. Cost of the trip, which is 
limited to 20 people, is $2,525 per person, including round-trip air 
transportation from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Several repeat programs planned for 1995 include New Zealand and Australia in 
January and February (30 days, $2,995), and Scandinavia -- Denmark, Sweden and 
Norway -- in March (four weeks, $2,625). Prices are per person, subject to 
minor fluctuations, and include round-trip air transportation to and between 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Abroad also is seeking hosts for foreign visitors to the United States 
from the same countries. For further information, itineraries and 1995 
programs, contact Seniors Abroad, 12533 Pacato Circle North, San Diego 92128; 
telephone (619) 485-1696.

 Senior honeymooners, or couples observing 25th, 50th or 60th wedding 
anniversaries during 1994, can travel two-for-one this year on KD River Cruises 
throughout Europe. From June to October, couples are eligible for a 50% 
discount in their silver, golden or diamond anniversary year, or if they've 
just been married. 
</P>
<P>
 The cruise line offers a choice of voyages on the Rhine, Danube and Elbe 
rivers, ranging from two to seven days. Typical is a five-day, four-country 
cruise from Basel, Switzerland to Amsterdam, with regular fares of 
$1,045-$1,285 per person, including all meals. With the discount, which must be 
requested at the time of booking, the same fares would apply per couple rather 
than per person. Prices are space-available and do not include air fare to and 
from embarkation cities in Europe. 
</P>

 A one-time "week of discovery and learning" at Vail, Colo., under the auspices 
of the White River Institute, is scheduled Sept. 18-24. Participants, who must 
be older than 50, create their own schedules from a variety of program options 
led by noted sportsmen, artisans, scholars and scientists. The choices include 
courses in writing from a noted author, cooking from a gourmet chef and 
watercolor painting from a well-known artist. Outdoor enthusiasts will learn 
fly-fishing on a pristine mountain river, while links fanatics study the 
mechanics of golf from the Swing Dynamics Institute. The program includes an 
archeology-geology field trip, classes in "Global Political Issues," and a 
choice of other subjects and activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The per-person price, based on double occupancy, is $1,775, which includes six 
nights lodging, all breakfasts and lunches, a welcoming reception and three 
dinners, including one with futurist Dick Lamm, a former Colorado governor. 
Also included are use of health club and spa facilities, daily exercise 
programs and a preparatory handbook. For complete details, write to EXPLORE,

TAKING THE KIDS: TRAVELING WITH DISABILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ, Taking the Kids appears weekly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen-year-old Wilson Buswell has braved the Hawaiian surf, skied the 
Colorado Rockies, rafted down a Utah river and toured the country by car. That 
Wilson is wheelchair-bound hasn't kept his family at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always thought Wilson should have the same kind of adventures as our 
other two kids," said Barbara Buswell, who lives in Colorado Springs, Colo., 
and is director of a state support program for families of children with 
disabilities. "I don't want to limit Wilson. That's how you learn about life." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the Buswells have pulled Wilson's wheel chair through the sand and 
carried it up hills, down rivers and through strange cities. "The night before 
I leave, I always think I'm crazy," Buswell said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that these children simply stayed home because travel was 
difficult. Wheelchairs wouldn't fit in hotel bathrooms. High curbs made city 
strolls impossible. But thanks to the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act 
(which mandates accessibility) and a generation of determined parents, families 
are taking to the road: toting wheelchairs and crutches and medicines, as they 
camp, ski and head to resorts and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more than willing to accommodate you if you explain what you 
need," said Mission Viejo resident Joan Stoddard, who traveled the country with 
her son Troy, who has cerebral palsy. Now a 22-year-old college student, Troy 
has become such an adept traveler that he makes solo journeys. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been more changes, than just the law. It's a real change in 
attitude. The public is much more welcoming now," said Stanley Klein, a 
psychologist and editor of "Exceptional Parent" magazine, which devoted much of 
its April issue to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein's advice for traveling with a disabled family member is to contact the 
National Parent Network on Disabilities (tel. 703-684-6763) for the name of a 
local parent group in the area to be visited. They offer advice on a variety of 
issues: from finding a baby-sitter who can care for a disabled child to finding 
specially equipped playgrounds. "Call ahead," Klein said, stressing that good 
planning -- and asking lots of questions -- is key to a successful trip. (For 
information about the monthly magazine, call 800-E-PARENT.) 
</P>
<P>
 "There are now hundreds of outdoors recreation activities for these children 
and their families to do together." This includes everything from skiing to 
sailing to snowmobiling to wind-surfing, said Ed Harrison, a spokesman for 
National Handicapped Sports, a nonprofit organization that promotes sports 
accessibility for people with disabilities (tel. 301-217-0960). 
</P>
<P>
 Take the granddaddy of them all: the National Sports Center for the Disabled 
in Winter Park, Colo. Their program began nearly 25 years ago to provide 
learn-to-ski programs for children with leg amputations. Since that time, it 
has grown to be the largest ski program of its kind in the world. It now serves 
3,000 disabled skiers each winter -- 60% of them kids -- said founder and 
director Hal O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the Tahoe Handicapped Ski School also offers winter and summer 
programs (tel. 916-989-0402). 
</P>
<P>
 The summer Winter Park program provides everything from wheelchair-accessible 
camping to mountain biking and rock climbing for the blind (tel. 303-726-5514). 
"It makes them realize they're not limited and that carries over to all parts 
of their lives," O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 For families who prefer less organized forays into the wilderness, there are 
national parks. Many now have at least one trail accessible to those with 
disabilities and accessibility is improving all of the time, said Wendy Roth 
and Michael Tompane, co-authors of the excellent paperback "Easy Access to 
National Parks" (The Sierra Club, $16).

 The foreign tourists come in the daytime and the couples come at night. They 
all want to see the Big Apple from on high, even if it costs them $6.17 each 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-minute, $74 helicopter flight is the most popular excursion offered by 
Liberty Helicopter Tours, one of two tour operators in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City is the third most popular site for helicopter tours, behind the 
Grand Canyon and the Hawaiian Islands, according to a 1992 survey conducted by 
Helicopter Assn. International, a trade group based in Alexandria, Va. In 1992, 
Liberty and its competitor, Island Helicopter, flew 123,000 people on city 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite high prices and short flights, foreign tourists and a few New Yorkers 
have flocked to these helicopter tours. What do they get for their money and 
why are they willing to spend? A look at Liberty provides some answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's $74 flight begins with Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty, 
southern Manhattan's looming skyscrapers and Battery Park. The helicopter then 
flies over Wall Street and up the East Side. Before heading back to Liberty's 
helipad on the Hudson River, it curves around the roof of the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in order to zoom over and up Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm quite interested in seeing the city from the air," said Carl Miller, a 
British tourist who earlier in the day had proposed to Joanne Eaton, also from 
Britain, at the top of the Statue of Liberty. "I've never been in a 
helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
 In Liberty's tours, two people sit in front with the pilot and four people sit 
in the back. A ride in one of the company's four helicopters is a noisy 
extravagance because of the loud whir from the helicopter's rapidly rotating 
overhead blades. 
</P>
<P>
 Like small airplanes, helicopters shake slightly on a windy day. Rudy Ioppolo, 
Liberty's general manager, said the company has never had an accident since it 
opened in September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Liberty's employees say that night tours are far better, Ioppolo said 
foreign tourists prefer to come during the day because it is easier to take 
pictures and because they want to see Broadway shows at night. 
</P>
<P>
 He said more couples come after dark because night tours are romantic.  
</P>
<P>
 The city glitters at night, with its million sparkling yellow and white lights 
and lit-up windows. New Jersey's ports look far more enchanting in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," said Victoria Sanger, who took a night tour with her 
boyfriend. "It makes you proud to be a New Yorker."

 Your readers may wish to know "News From Brazil," (tel. 213-255-8062) a local 
publication with national distribution, carries information about tours and 
flights to Bahia and Brazil at more competitive prices than those mentioned in 
the Guidebook. And one does not need to travel to Brazil to enjoy the 
dance-fight art of capoeira, which Ms. Cohen ably described. The "Brasil, 
Brasil Cultural Center" (tel. 310-840-2794) offers capoeira classes and 
demonstrations.

 Your attempt to remake history ("Events," April 17) should be pointed out. In 
May, 1864, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman was nowhere near Virginia. He was just 
beginning his famous march to Atlanta -- starting from Chattanooga, Tenn. Gen. 
Ulysses S. Grant was in command of the Federal troops at the Wilderness.

GAMBLING WITH LIVES; DELAY IN QUAKE RETROFITTING FOR FREEWAYS IS INTOLERABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The images of twisted metal, boulder-size chunks of concrete and buckled 
freeway decks after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake should stand as vivid 
reminders to all Californians that delays in the state's highway 
earthquake-retrofitting program cannot be tolerated. Not when the potential 
still exists for severe damage to billions of dollars of public infrastructure; 
not when public safety could be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 So even though a Sacramento Superior Court judge on Tuesday ruled 
unconstitutional a new state law giving the California Department of 
Transportation the authority to hire private-sector consultants and engineers 
for highway design projects -- including retrofitting projects -- Gov. Pete 
Wilson and the Legislature must not be deterred. They must find a way to ensure 
that efforts to strengthen bridges and overpasses continue, uninterrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says the ruling could "seriously hinder" finalizing at least $60 
million in contracts devoted to seismic retrofitting. However, some state 
officials privately are pleased with the opportunity to appeal the ruling by 
Judge Eugene T. Gualco. Gualco, who has presided over the long-running court 
battle pitting Caltrans against the union representing its engineers, has 
infuriated state officials with a number of court orders limiting the state's 
power to employ private contractors. Some of his decisions have been 
responsible for delays in freeway retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the findings of a special report published in The Times last February, 
California cannot stand any more foot-dragging. About 80% of the 1,300 most 
vulnerable freeway bridges and overpasses, it was found, had not been repaired 
since the state embarked on an ambitious freeway retrofitting program after the 
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans must find a way to keep the program going. If it doesn't, then the 
enormous effort and expense of rebuilding the Los Angeles-area freeways damaged 
Jan. 17 may merely foreshadow even greater problems. Complacency cannot be 
afforded in a state where earthquakes are inevitable.

SOME OLD CRIMES NEVER DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruling last week in a controversial World War II case, a French jury upheld 
the principle that there is such a thing as a "crime against humanity," and 
that such crimes are so egregious there can be no time limit for prosecuting 
the individuals who commit them. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involved Paul Touvier, 79, the former militia chief for the Vichy 
regime, the French government that cooperated with the German forces that 
occupied France from 1940 to 1944.Touvier was convicted of complicity in crimes 
against humanity for having ordered the execution of seven Jewish prisoners in 
June, 1944. The executions were carried out on the demand of Nazi authorities 
who originally wanted 30 prisoners killed in retaliation for the assassination 
of a top Vichy official. 
</P>
<P>
 Touvier's attorney tried to defend his client's actions by claiming that the 
execution of the seven saved the lives of 23 other potential victims. The 
attorney also argued that France's 30-year statute of limitations on war crimes 
should have precluded the prosecution of Touvier for actions that took place 
half a century earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Many French citizens are still deeply troubled by the realization that there 
were so many people who, like Touvier, collaborated with the Nazis, out of 
opportunism if not actual sympathy. The verdict in this trial is a hopeful sign 
that modern France is willing to deal with those painful memories both 
forthrightly and honorably. With new crimes against humanity happening in 
places like Bosnia and elsewhere, the importance of the Touvier verdict cannot 
be overestimated.

RODNEY KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I'm fed up and outraged about the Rodney King award of $3.8 million (April 
20). I did not support the police methods used on King, nor am I sympathetic to 
any form of racism, but I must state that the jury trial system has gone 
berserk! 
</P>
<P>
 King is a repeated lawbreaker, and now I'm expected to pay (in part) for the 
actions of a bunch of idiots. The fair thing to do would have been to pay for 
all of King's medical treatments, and for his lawyers to be limited to seeking 
compensation from the officers who did the beating and their boss, the police 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we have a system that can't even convict two self-admitted murderers 
of their parents, and now gives away millions at the expense of law-abiding, 
innocent taxpayers. Are we completely stupid? Have we given up the common good 
and surrendered to the twisted agenda of greedy lawyers? 
</P>
<P>
 FRANK BRUNNER 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 * This is in response to your article about a jury awarding a man under the 
influence who was violating his parole (Rodney King) $3.8 million, followed by 
your description of 14 other police-related city settlements made since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 6 1/2 years there have been thousands of difficult and 
danger-fraught incidents every month that police competently responded to when 
citizens broke the law. Where is the recognition and acclaim we ought to be 
giving these officers in blue for a consistent and professional job well done? 
Why is there not a resounding cry of thanks to the LAPD who "protect and serve" 
and risk their lives as a matter of daily course? 
</P>
<P>
 Enough with the finger-pointing at the relatively infrequent moments of error. 
Let us all keep in perspective how much good is accomplished, compared to the 
minimum of mistakes that tragically occur.

ARNOLD GARCIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Probation Commission wishes to thank The Times for the accurate account 
of the tragedy that took place at the Probation Department's Dorothy Kirby 
Treatment Center. Your report of the brutal attack upon and subsequent death of 
Arnold Garcia, a group supervisor, was handled with considerable restraint and 
sensitivity (April 6, 10). 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks ahead, a major effort will be spent in determining how and why 
the sad event took place, and the steps that can be taken to avoid subsequent 
acts of violence by young people involved with the juvenile justice system. 
Unfortunately, though necessary, these fact-finding efforts will in no way 
comfort Arnold Garcia's widow and 11 children, one of whom is only 10 months 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Probation Commission's hope that your readers translate their shock 
and sympathy into actions that will benefit the family of a man who spent 17 
years of his life worrying about other people's children. Perhaps we can repay 
the debt and help his family with a contribution to the Arnold Garcia Memorial 
Fund, c/o Paul Higa, Probation Department Headquarters, 9150 E. Imperial 
Highway, Room N-91, Downey, 90242.

DEMONSTRATIONS OVER OCTOPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recently the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, and my husband, Mike Schaadt (the 
aquarium's exhibit director), have come under attack by animal rights 
activists. The aquarium is a wonderful, nonprofit, educational facility. 
Hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren have visited the aquarium since its 
beginning in 1935. They have many programs set up specifically to get these 
children excited about marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband became a marine biologist because of his love of the ocean and all 
its creatures. He is a man of honesty and integrity, and is very well-respected 
in his field. He and the aquarium have been completely truthful in everything 
concerning the giant octopus they recently had on display and are very upset by 
its accidental death. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal rights groups, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) 
and Education and Action for Animals (EAA), in my opinion, have been far from 
open and honest. They purposely misinformed the public about the health of the 
animal and the reasons the aquarium was keeping it. They seem only interested 
in news media attention. From the media the aquarium found out about the 
protesters' planned demonstrations, two at the aquarium, and most recently, 
April 13, at our home. They are not only disrupting the aquarium and Mike's 
work there, but they are disrupting our personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Our oldest son was harassed when he was home sick from school April 12. This 
frightened him very much. Our younger children are afraid to go to bed at 
night. Our 7-year-old voiced the fear April 13 that these people were going to 
burn our house down while she slept. This is not something we would ever have 
said to her. This was her own perception of things she doesn't understand.  
</P>
<P>
 It is bad enough that Mike has to deal with this at work when he has done 
nothing more than try to give others the chance to share his love for the 
ocean's creatures. But I find it unconscionable that these people would bring 
this into our personal lives, frightening our children and disrupting our whole 
neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 There are legitimate animal rights issues. But in actions such as occurred 
April 13, these protesters are giving animal rights activists a very bad name. 
I just hope that in the future they can find a way to channel their actions to 
more legitimate issues in more appropriate ways.  
</P>
<P>
 CELESTE SCHAADT 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * The octopus Octavia didn't surprise me when she "pulled the plug" (April 
12). This marine animal, which belongs to the class Cephalopoda , has the most 
complex brain and nervous system among invertebrates, making it belong to the 
most intelligent group of animals in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they like to hide in confined spaces, this doesn't mean that they 
don't need a large space for movement activities, foraging behaviors and other 
socially related behaviors. For the octopus to move, it needs enough room to be 
able to spurt water from its funnel, which propels it through water rather fast 
and elegantly. Color changes are controlled by the nervous system and hormones, 
which are mostly behavioral indicators for alarm or courtship demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The color change of Octavia was a clear sign of distress that should have been 
recognized by the aquarium's staff. Committing suicide was the only alternative 
to prison for this octopus. When will we learn to be responsible enough to not 
abuse our ability to make choices and stop punishing other species for our 
entertainment?

SPIELBERG, WILSON AT OAKLAND SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am a sixth-grader who goes to a middle school in Santa Monica. I was 
appalled to read in the newspaper the offensive remarks of Kandi Stewart (April 
12), the student body president of Castlemont High School in Oakland whose 
students laughed during the movie "Schindler's List." Her statements were 
offensive because they insulted the governor of California. Even if she does 
not like him, I think some respect should be given. It is not right to attack 
someone who is a guest in the school, especially one who is of such great 
importance to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Those teachers who don't want to read about the Holocaust are being extremely 
selfish. They only want to teach about whatever their heritage is. This 
self-centeredness is what is wrong with America.

 * I guess it's a sign of the times when a teacher isn't ashamed to say that 
her students "don't know where Germany or Europe are" . . . she probably 
doesn't know herself! I think the school system was better off with geography 
and history classes versus the supposedly all-encompassing social studies. The 
tenor of the statements from the teachers at Castlemont is indicative of why 
the United States is slowly sinking to the bottom of the world's education 
ladder.

 * How disappointing of The Times to cover the announcement of the "Schindler's 
List" education project as a political story full of inaccuracies and 
distortions.  
</P>
<P>
 The facts are: Gov. Pete Wilson signed legislation requiring the teaching of 
both the Holocaust and slavery in California schools two years before 
"Schindler's List" was filmed; the governor's legislation was the stimulus for 
Steven Spielberg's collaborating on this project with the governor -- a project 
that brings the film to 16,000 California 10th- and 11th-graders each week at 
no cost to the state or the students; over 30 other states are already 
duplicating the California "Schindler's List" project because of personal 
marketing and support by both Wilson and Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The distortions are: On March 15, Castlemont High School accepted an 
invitation to host the announcement of the statewide "Schindler's List" 
project. Immediately, after the publicity linking Castlemont and "Schindler's 
List," Castlemont's principal, Ellen Posey, promised to introduce Holocaust 
education into the school curriculum. As a result, Wilson presented Castlemont 
High School with a statewide "Courage to Care Award," and Spielberg agreed to 
visit the campus. Neither the governor nor Spielberg came to Castlemont without 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most astounding distortion is your reporting of a hostile question 
posed by one student. The Times did not report the governor's full answer, 
which concluded that he came to the school to respect their dignity and had 
hoped they would respect his. This line goes to the heart of the "Schindler's 
List" project; it is time to try to teach Californians to respect each other's 
backgrounds, differences and dignity.

COMMENTARY; PERSPECTIVE ON TEACHING; HOW DID WE FORGET THE KIDS?; A TEACHER WHO 
SAYS ALL CHILDREN HAVE THE UNEQUIVOCAL RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION FINDS THE WILL TO 
KEEP TRYING FROM THOSE WHO DON'T MAKE IT.; EYEWITNESS: SANDRA MCBRAYER * AS 
TOLD TO JONATHAN FREEDMAN AUTHOR OF "FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE"

By Sandra McBrayer, Sandra McBrayer, who founded a pioneering school for 
homeless children in San Diego, is 1994 National Teacher of the Year.

<TEXT>
<P>
 All children have an unequivocal right to an education in America. No strings 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. schools, we have many entry requirements: immunization, residency, 
immigration, legal guardianship. If children don't have papers, they are turned 
away. I would like schools to be open to all children. 
</P>
<P>
 Every child has the potential to learn. I had a homeless child who entered my 
program. When I was getting him books, he told me: "Oh, you don't understand. I 
can't learn."  
</P>
<P>
 I said, "Don't be silly. Of course, you can." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no. My teachers told me!" And he produced a report card with Ds and 
Fs. Under "comments," a teacher had written, "Difficulty with learning." 
</P>
<P>
 I started working one-on-one with this 16-year-old. He didn't even know what a 
fraction was. So, instead of using the textbook, I incorporated real-life math. 
I took him into the school kitchen and cut an orange in half. While I fed him 
with one half, he learned math with the other. I took him in the laundry room. 
We learned fractions with cups of laundry soap. As we provided him with clean 
clothes, he was introduced to fractions.  
</P>
<P>
 I serve kids called "unattended homeless youth." They live on the streets of 
San Diego, on rooftops, in abandoned buildings, under freeways. They sell 
drugs. Sell themselves. Do everything they can to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 My school teaches the whole child. We feed children who are hungry, clothe 
children who are ill-clothed, provide showers and laundry. We have day-care for 
children with babies. We provide everything a child traditionally would get. 
</P>
<P>
 And we provide them with an academic component. I work for the California 
Department of Education, specifically the San Diego County Office of Education. 
We offer the California core curriculum -- a high school diploma or equivalent. 
We supplement it with parenting, self-esteem, anger management, conflict 
resolution, drug and alcohol awareness, street survival and coping skills. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 20 years in California, we have built 28 prisons and one 
university. More than 85% of the prison population are high school dropouts. 
Locking people up without education is clearly not working. The only time 
change occurs is when education has happened. 
</P>
<P>
 My children are a prime example. I have 29 former students enrolled in college 
today. I have hundreds holding jobs, renting and paying taxes. They are not 
committing crime, not taking from society but giving. 
</P>
<P>
 There are millions of teachers like me in classrooms across this country. Good 
teachers are not born; they're made. It is a learned skill. The skills of 
listening, compassion, unconditional acceptance were modeled to me by teachers 
and administrators in San Diego.  
</P>
<P>
 Burnout is a very realistic dilemma for many teachers. But when you're making 
decisions about yourself, your problems and your students, you don't get burned 
out. We need site-based management, empowering teachers to make professional 
decisions that affect their lives, and their students'. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years we were an industrialized nation and we built factory workers. 
We are now being asked to build global, productive citizens. Teaching must be 
given the respect our profession deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 I wear a pager; my students can call me 24 hours a day. When I tell a child I 
care, I'm looking in their eyes and I feel it inside of me. I don't think a hug 
can ever be worn out.  
</P>
<P>
 What does it cost? Everything I have -- the showers, laundry, clothes and food 
-- comes from the community in the form of donations. Everything a teacher 
needs, the community has. We need to build a partnership with business, police 
departments, churches and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, hope is everywhere -- in the hug of a homeless child, in a smile on 
graduation day. One day, this kid ran into the building jumping with joy: He 
got his first job. Someone had believed in him. And suddenly, every hard day in 
the classroom had been erased for me as I watched this child find hope. 
</P>
<P>
 I have sat at my desk and had a 16- or 17-year-old going through a traumatic 
experience climb into my lap and just sob. And then they dry their eyes and we 
talk about the problem; they go out and solve it as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 When children graduate, people say, "That must keep you going." It doesn't. 
What truly keeps me going are the children I fail.  
</P>
<P>
 One day, I watched a child sell his shoes for a hit on a crack pipe. Seeing 
that picture made my dedication to education 100 times stronger, made my love 
for children 100 times greater and made me work harder every minute of every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems so simple to care for kids. How did we forget that?

COMMENTARY; DEAR DAD: WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?; VIETNAM: A DAUGHTER PONDERS 
THE WAR'S UNSPOKEN SPECTER OVER HER FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN TROWBRIDGE, Erin Trowbridge is a senior at Sarah Lawrence College in 
Bronxville, N.Y. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In my family, Armistice Day is April 23 -- the day the Vietnam War officially 
ended. My father returned to our home in Indiana five years before the war's 
end in 1975, but President Ford's declaration from New Orleans that April 
promised a desperately needed peace for us. 
</P>
<P>
 My father would no longer have to watch the news gripping his chair while his 
knuckles turned white. He wouldn't have to sit alone on the back porch staring 
out into the fields. My mother would have no more need to make excuses for his 
strange behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 19 years since the war ended, remarkably little has changed in our 
house. Peace didn't bring relief to my father, nor did it help me to understand 
him. There was even a time when I became one of his accusers. 
</P>
<P>
 When I saw a movie like "Platoon" or "Deer Hunter," I made sure my father 
didn't know I had. Did those films tell his story, I wondered? In the wake of 
Dad's silence about the war, I became convinced that he must have done 
something horrible. By the time I was 12, I was sure his refusal to discuss 
Vietnam was an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 As reports detailing the crimes of the war reached our small town, North 
Manchester, my father and the other 16 surviving local veterans became social 
pariahs. When the subject of Vietnam came up in class, my teacher asked if I 
would like to be excused. He and my classmates assumed that my father's 
presence in Vietnam deserved blame, and that I would be uneasy about the war. 
</P>
<P>
 I failed to understand then that my father's distance from my life was 
intentional. He kept his past away from me because he was afraid of hindering 
my future. I decided that if I were going to have a relationship with my 
father, I would have to play by his rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily, we went through the motions of being father and daughter. We ate dinner 
together every evening, then watched "All In the Family." Our relationship 
hinted at closeness only late at night, when Dad would wake me up to eat French 
toast and fried-egg sandwiches with him. But even then, our conversations did 
not involve anything pertaining to our lives. We talked about cars, mainly the 
antique Studebaker Avanti he had his heart set on buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from our relationship was real conflict. There was so much that went 
unsaid that there was no room -- or perhaps too much room -- for conflict. One 
disagreement would have brought our whole relationship tumbling down. We went 
about our lives with a benign tolerance of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until I left for college that I finally recognized the 
self-destructive circle that our relationship had become. I began to understand 
the possibility that my father's only crime was to have been in Vietnam in the 
first place. Even if he had not seen one day of combat, his mere association 
with the war was enough to leave him stigmatized. 
</P>
<P>
 In his recent book, "Daddy's Gone to War," William Tuttle documents how World 
War II affected the family lives of the veterans. He maintains that a terrible 
distance often emerged between the veterans and their families because the 
families had learned to live without them. Sometimes, though, it was what the 
soldier had seen while "in country" that made life so difficult. Tuttle 
observes these problems in veterans who came home as heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 With Vietnam, it was as if the soldiers were coming home after a prison term. 
Public opinion said they ought to be ashamed of the time they had served. They 
came home without the ticker-tape greetings, and, more disastrously, without 
social services to help them readjust. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the government has begun to deal with the distress suffered 
by the Vietnam veteran. But what many don't see is that within the families of 
veterans, the war is still being fought and still taking casualties. As the 
government and the Veterans of Foreign Wars have come to see the necessity of 
making amends with Vietnam vets, they have shown us -- their children -- our 
responsibility. Today, we must acknowledge the role we played in making things 
worse for our fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 In my grade-school diary, I ended every entry by writing "I love Dad and I 
know he loves me." I believed that if anything happened to me, my dad would 
ultimately be assured that he was a good father and I was a devoted daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, I tried to be more explicit about showing my feelings. One 
day, I donned the army fatigue jacket that he kept buried in the basement under 
a pile of old books. I wanted him to see that his baby daughter was now big 
enough to wear his old fatigues and that the war was so far behind us that it 
had lost whatever symbolism it had. 
</P>
<P>
 When I call home from college, I try to avoid speaking to my father, unless 
there is a problem with my car. It is too painful to ask "So, what's going on?" 
and end up with small talk. I believe that if my father had not been in 
Vietnam, things would be different. I'm sure that he knows how to be a good 
parent, but he can't find a way to break 23 years of silence. Neither of us 
knows what the next step is, but we both want to take it.

FALSE ACCOUNT OF GIRL'S DEATH LEADS TO SUIT; AN ESTRANGED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

SUDDENLY WALKS IN THE DOOR OF THEIR TINY HOME.

 Maria J. Gonzalez says she is still haunted by the phone call that is every 
parent's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 She hadn't seen her daughter in several months. Seventeen-year-old Maria Elena 
ran away after a family dispute last spring and had avoided contact with her 
mother. Then Gonzalez left for Mexico to nurse her sick father, and when she 
returned three weeks later, her daughter's best friend called, crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Why didn't you tell me (Maria Elena) was dead?' " Gonzalez, 37, 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the report of Maria Elena's premature death was itself 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend explained that the Jordan High School newspaper, the Bulldog City 
Chronicle, had published an obituary with Maria Elena's photo in the final 1993 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 There, on Page 6 with two other obituaries, was her daughter's freshman 
identification picture with the brief words about her "death": "Maria J. (sic) 
Gonzalez, born in Mexico on May 16, 1976, at the age of 16." The obituary did 
not say when the girl died but said she was a victim of street violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez panicked when she couldn't immediately reach relatives who could 
confirm the information. She said she was in such shock that she didn't 
recognize her three other children or the relatives who gathered at the house 
when they heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Then young Maria Elena walked in the door of their tiny home on Garden View 
Avenue. Gonzalez said she thought she was seeing a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her hands got all tangled up and she couldn't move," Maria Elena, now 18, 
said of her mother. "She kept saying, 'It's not her. It's not her.' Then she 
just hugged me for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The school newspaper staff had made a mistake. A female student had died, but 
it wasn't Maria Elena, who was attending South Gate High after she ran away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Unified School District on 
March 30, alleging that the school was negligent in its supervision of the 
newspaper and caused "infliction of emotional distress." Gonzalez's attorney, 
John Watson, has asked the school district to pay $300,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students should have been adequately supervised if they're going to 
publish information in a newspaper," Watson said. "They have the duty to make 
sure the information is correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan High School administrators wouldn't comment on the case. Attorneys for 
the school district said they had not yet reviewed the complaint. "We certainly 
believe this is an unfortunate incident, but we do not believe that the lawsuit 
for damages in this case is appropriate so we will have no other recourse but 
to defend ourselves," said Rich Mason, district special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's principal at the time of the incident, Grace B. Strauther, sent a 
letter apologizing for the "heartache and hardship" the mistake had caused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Appropriate members of our staff and administration have been severely 
counseled on the importance of checking not only the accuracy of facts but also 
of pictures. . . ," the letter said. "This type of error will never happen 
again at this school." Strauther, who has since been promoted to a district 
administration position, promised to print a retraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Apperson, district legal adviser, said a retraction would be "the 
appropriate legal correction." But Gonzalez said the school never sent her a 
copy of the retraction. The district's legal department said it is unclear 
whether one has been published since the paper resumed publication in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Elena is now completing a program outside the school district to become 
a medical assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said the trauma she experienced continues, and Maria Elena still 
worries about her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes she starts crying by herself," Maria Elena said, "and I ask her 
what's wrong and she says, 'Nothing.' "

NEW MUSEUM CHIEF CALLS FUND RAISING A PRIORITY; JAMES LAWRENCE POWELL HOPES TO 
BUILD ON RESEARCH REPUTATION OF COUNTY'S MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Dinosaur exhibits and a saber-toothed cat logo once drew the most attention at 
Los Angeles County's Natural History Museum. But recent turmoil among the staff 
and the appointment of a new executive director have become the focus of recent 
public attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, museum officials announced that James Lawrence Powell will replace 
Craig C. Black as head of the 80-year-old institution, effective July 1. 
Powell, executive director of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, will 
inherit a museum plagued by internal turmoil and a budget that has been 
whittled from about $14 million to $9 million by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard S. Volpert, chairman of the museum's foundation, said Powell's 
appointment reflected the need to improve morale at the museum as well as 
increase financial support for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were several things we were looking for, and clearly . . . staff esprit 
de corps needs a lot of attention," Volpert said. "Secondly, fund raising is 
important. We've got to put the museum more visibly on the map so we can raise 
funds. And thirdly, I'm hopeful we can work out some type of reliable 
relationship with the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Volpert said Powell's expertise as a fund-raiser and his academic credentials 
would help attract money and enhance the museum's reputation. "He's a very 
experienced person. Just look at his resume," Volpert said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from his home in Philadelphia, Powell agreed thatfund 
raising must be a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that one of the reasons the board hired me is because of my 
fund-raising skills, and I enjoy doing it and have a good track record," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, a geologist, currently serves on the National Science Board. Before 
coming to the Franklin Institute in 1991, he was president of Reed College in 
Portland, Ore.. He served as president of Franklin and Marshall College in 
Lancaster, Pa., from 1983 until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sad to see him go and will greatly miss the leadership he provided us 
here," said Joseph Moore, executive vice president of the Franklin Institute. 
"When Dr. Powell arrived, he was instrumental in bringing the (fund-raising) 
campaign to closure by putting into place a truly comprehensive . . . program." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell helped raise almost $9 million in less than two years and helped 
reorganize management of the Franklin Institute's staff, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell said he is leaving the Franklin Institute because Los Angeles is the 
city of the future. "It's the place where we can make a multicultural museum 
work. I'm interested in science and science research. The museum has a strong 
history in both these areas, and my wife is from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment marks the end of an 11-month search to replace Black, whose 
12-year tenure as the museum's executive director recently came under fire and 
led the County Board of Supervisors to order an audit of the Exposition Park 
museum last year. The report prepared by the county auditor-controller's office 
found museum managers had violated Civil Service rules during a recent round of 
layoffs and failed to maintain an adequate inventory of the museum's 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the report found that Black used county employees to remodel his 
Hancock Park home and said the county had not been fully reimbursed by the 
museum foundation for the work. He was cleared of any serious wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Black announced his retirement a few days before the report was issued. The 
announcement touched off a nationwide search for a replacement. A private 
search firm narrowed the field to four candidates before Powell was selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Black's recent troubles, supporters praised the Harvard-educated 
paleontologist as an innovator. Under his 12-year tenure, attendance at the 
museum grew by nearly 20% and private contributions to the museum increased 
from about $400,000 to $5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics had questioned the direction Black was taking at the museum and 
the allotment of scarce resources to a marine sciences program. 
</P>
<P>
 Volpert defended Black, saying many of the problems were caused by budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you are dealing with at the museum is . . . an over 50% cut in county 
positions because of funding cuts. And I can't think of any institution where 
if you cut 50% of the staff, you aren't going to have a great deal of turmoil," 
Volpert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials said Powell's salary has yet to be settled but that the 
county's contribution to the director's pay will remain unchanged. Black earns 
about $96,000 a year from the county, and the museum foundation pays him about 
$85,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Black has said he will retire to Albuquerque, N.M., where he will continue to 
do research and teach. He declined comment last week.

BINGO OPERATORS FEAR EFFECTS OF CITY-SPONSORED GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some nonprofit groups fear they will be losers if the city of South Gate 
enters the bingo game. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are negotiating with the Oldtimers Foundation to open a bingo 
parlor at 5645 Firestone Blvd. The foundation, a nonprofit organization that 
provides meals, recreational programs, transportation and other services to 
senior citizens, has run small weekly bingo games for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent proposal that would team the foundation and the city as bingo 
partners in a daily game could threaten the existence of games run as 
fund-raisers by churches, schools and other organizations, said Richard Tyle, 
manager of American Legion Post No. 335, which has also hosted a weekly bingo 
game for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no doubts it would close us up," Tyle said. Proceeds from American 
Legion bingo games fund special programs at South Gate High School, the Police 
Department and other organizations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oldtimers Foundation bingo parlor has been under discussion for several 
months, but it has yet to be formally considered by two newly elected council 
members. Officials said the Oldtimers Foundation's proposal, one of two 
submitted to the city, is being considered because of its longtime operations 
in South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 New Councilman Henry C. Gonzalez said many groups raised the bingo parlor as a 
concern during his recent election campaign. With new members on the council, 
the proposal is not a "done deal," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have real mixed feelings," he said. "It's been kept awful quiet. I want to 
ask for a public hearing to get input from the community before I would vote on 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 The bingo venture could garner up to 50% of the parlor's net income for the 
city, all but 1% of which would be funneled to local charitable organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Todd W. Argow said the proposal is attractive because it would 
raise revenue without raising taxes. 
</P>

 "There has been some discussion that it could be a good source of revenue, 
perhaps over $1 million a year," Argow said. The income would also benefit 
charities, in addition to the Oldtimers Foundation, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Groups such as the American Legion fear they will be left out of the winner's 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bingo is about the only way to raise money," Tyle said. "I guess the city is 
in the same shape as all the service clubs and I guess the city comes first. 
But I would definitely go up there and fight it." 
</P>
<P>
 But George Cole, executive director of the Oldtimers Foundation, said that his 
group will cooperate with other nonprofit groups to ensure that there will be 
no loss of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will guarantee that money flows to those organizations no matter what 
happens," he said.

 Leading a tour through his jazz club and restaurant, Gainesville, Roy Gaines 
practically bubbled over with the eagerness and unabashed pride of a new 
parent.  
</P>
<P>
 "You see these? All oak," he said, gesturing toward the elegant parquet floors 
and paneled walls of the split-level main dining room, where whirring ceiling 
fans added to the distinctly Southern feel of the place. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved, as quickly as his words, to another room outfitted wall to wall with 
recording equipment. "State of the art," he declared, running his hands over 
the console. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago Gaines, 56, set about to create something different for the 
Crenshaw area and the black community: a top-of-the-line jazz and blues club. 
After much work, little financial assistance and a lot of uncertainty about the 
club's future during its sporadic development, Gaines finally opened 
Gainesville three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is also the only commercial venue in the Central City that 
regularly showcases gospel, during Sunday brunches. Now, said Gaines, his 
vision of showcasing indigenous American music is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm making a stand for this music," said Gaines, a blues guitarist whose 
hearty manner and distinct drawl betray his Texas roots. "This is black 
people's music. Somebody has to always keep it going, and it's not going to be 
Coors or KFC making commercials with it. It has to be us." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an extensive menu that ranges from $5 pizzas to pricier New 
Orleans-style seafood plates, Gainesville offers blues and jazz performances 
three nights a week by local legends and world-renowned artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Oscar Brown Jr. played last week, and jazz pianist Joe Sample, 
flutist Hubert Laws and drummer Stix Hooper are scheduled to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-tech recording system, which operates from two rooms and includes 
rows of strategically mounted speakers along the ceiling, will enable artists 
to cut album-quality live recordings that Gaines hopes to sell to radio 
stations and other outlets as a way of supporting his business. 
</P>
<P>
 It'll also be a way to set high musical standards and boost Gainesville's 
visibility among those who believe that jazz and blues clubs exist only in the 
Westside and outlying areas, Gaines said. "That's why I wanted to do this -- I 
was tired of playing blues myself at the Embassy Suites in West Covina every 
week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After acquiring the property at 5716 Crenshaw Blvd. in 1986, Gaines spent the 
next eight years, and nearly $500,000 of his own money, building the 
restaurant. Friends and fellow musicians pitched in: Jazz saxophonist and 
producer Wayne Henderson provided Gaines with most of his audio and recording 
equipment and produced Gaines' new album, "Blues Crossover '94," at the 
restaurant's studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, a recovering alcoholic, takes most pride in the fact that he saw the 
project through after deciding in 1988 that building Gainesville would replace 
alcohol as his primary passion. Gainesville serves a variety of coffees and 
nonalcoholic wines, but no liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those chandeliers, those speakers, all the things you see here are my whiskey 
bottles now," said Gaines. "I always did get a thrill out of doing things 
against the odds -- taking something hopeless and turning it around. Well, I'm 
flat broke now, but I did it." ERIN J. AUBRY

 Marker poised, Jim Muldaven stood at a flip chart and posed the million-dollar 
question to about 100 Crenshaw and Dorsey high school students: 
</P>
<P>
 What are the most pressing problems you see in your communities, and how would 
you solve them? 
</P>
<P>
 Before Muldaven finished speaking, hands shot up in the air and opinions flew 
from all corners of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of charged response was typical during the two-day symposium at 
UCLA, created to give South-Central teen-agers a forum to voice their opinions 
on urban issues and, more important, allow them to shape and implement 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody focuses on gangs as being the main problem, but it's not just 
them," said participant Renisha Davis, 16, a Crenshaw sophomore. "There's a lot 
more to it than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Perspectives L.A. Youth Conference was co-sponsored by the 
university and Capitol Focus, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that 
attempts to raise the political awareness of teen-agers and young adults in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldaven founded Capitol Focus and has conducted similar programs in seven 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids get to identify what issues they want to put their time and energy 
into," Muldaven said. "And they can't be as easily dismissed by politicians and 
other adults when they've really thought things through and come up with plans 
of action." 
</P>
<P>
 Muldaven piloted the Crenshaw-Dorsey project after meeting educator and 
community activist Celestine Palmer at a Capitol Focus conference in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, a Crenshaw resident and co-chair of the state Democratic Party's 
Woman's Caucus, organized a student steering committee that prepared the 
conference agenda. Palmer and the student group christened themselves the 
Dorsey-Crenshaw Area Youth Action League, and Palmer was named coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big issue here is youth disenfranchisement, and how to change it," said 
Palmer. "Kids don't want to hear adults speak. They need their own identity." 
</P>
<P>
 With a $75,000 grant from the James Irvine Foundation, the Action League will 
be able to continue workshops and offer stipends for student league workers for 
at least two years. Muldaven has already acquired office equipment such as a 
fax machine, and is seeking a Crenshaw-area space to house the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can do good things only if we keep (the workshops) up," said Jermaine 
Watson, an 18-year-old Dorsey senior. "We have to keep active, back up what we 
say." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow Dorsey student Ebonee Maxey agreed. "This is about perseverance," said 
Maxey, who identified apathy as the most critical problem facing South-Central. 
"If enough of us try, and if we get outside help, we can accomplish things." 
</P>
<P>
 The workshops, mediated by teachers, lawyers and other professionals, covered 
an array of topics: youth empowerment, school safety, inter-ethnic relations, 
youth entrepreneurship, life after high school -- even a special session on the 
controversial "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants brainstormed on problems and solutions, brought them back to the 
larger group and voted on which problems were most pressing and what solutions 
were most feasible.  
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the conference, the students decided to work for increased 
parent involvement in schools, more human relations and cultural education 
classes, and abstinence for teens who are not ready for sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ersho Eromo, 17, said all the talk is a small but significant step forward. 
"Everything starts with the individual," said the Dorsey junior. "Everything 
depends on what each person does." ERIN J. AUBRY

 The Jan. 17 earthquake caused widespread destruction, but some theatrically 
minded senior citizens are proving it shook them up for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the OASIS Ensemble, a performance troupe of senior citizens, 
presented its first program of original works at the Vision Complex Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 They managed to put on the show despite the fact that the quake closed down 
the headquarters of their senior center, OASIS, housed in the Robinsons-May 
store in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. The damaged store, and OASIS, will 
not reopen until June. 
</P>
<P>
 The OASIS introductory drama class had met only once before the quake, and the 
closure forced it and other senior programs to scramble for temporary space. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama students found a haven at Crossroads Arts Academy, part of the 
Vision Complex in Leimert Park. It did so well that instructor Sharon Neumann, 
Crossroads Executive Director Avril Harris and OASIS Director Cynthia Berry 
decided to not only put on a show, but also to take it on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teacher was so impressed with the material that she was getting from the 
students that she called me, and that's when we all sat down and decided to 
make this a tour," Berry said.  
</P>
<P>
 The players scripted their own material from improvisations inspired by life 
experiences and personal issues as senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry and Harris say they are shopping the troupe around to other senior 
citizen centers, convalescent and nursing homes, churches, schools, and other 
organizations and venues. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; DISCOUNT MART HELPS GROCERS CUT PRICES

<P>
 Community Wholesale Grocers Inc., an organization established to sell grocery 
products at affordable prices to small market owners, has opened its flagship 
wholesale store near the Downtown produce markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30,000-square-foot store at 824 E. 17th St. aims to serve the many small 
grocers who come to the produce and wholesale districts to purchase supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Community Wholesale Grocers Store No. 2 has been in business since 
the end of February, an official grand opening celebration will be held at 
10:30 a.m. Friday, on the second anniversary of the 1992 riots. It was the 
riots and subsequent efforts to rebuild the community that prompted creation of 
Community Wholesale Grocers Inc., by the Pacific Asian Consortium in 
Employment, a Koreatown-based economic development organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Consortium officials realized that the high prices shoppers complain about at 
neighborhood stores are a result of what shop owners pay for their inventory. 
Small stores, which spend only a few hundred dollars per week on stock, 
generally don't buy enough to meet the minimum order requirements of most large 
wholesalers, which can require as much as $6,000 a week in purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Wholesale Grocers opened its first store, a 12,000-square-foot 
warehouse, in Hawthorne in 1992, providing small grocers a place to buy a 
complete line of groceries, frozen foods, and health and beauty products.  
</P>
<P>
 Community Wholesale Grocers officials said the organization purchases its 
stock from local manufacturers and a major wholesaler and keeps prices down 
with low overhead costs. The Hawthorne store now serves about 300 of the 
estimated 1,600 small stores in South-Central and South Los Angeles, according 
to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Downtown store already has 300 customers and expects to draw many more 
with its location. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is to serve a greater general Los Angeles," said Sam Sohn, manager of 
Store No. 2. "Our business has shown a really respectable growth already. It's 
been tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 The store is open from 6 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday. There are 
no sales to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment has used government and private 
funds, including a $440,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Human and Health 
Services, to open and operate the two stores and hopes to open four more 
locations by next year. IRIS YOKOI

 Obioma Iwuoma always felt out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Nigeria, Iwuoma never felt he fit into the "all-American lifestyle" 
his childhood schoolmates in Baldwin Hills and Venice seemed to enjoy. He felt 
uncomfortable at home with his parents' strict rules. 
</P>
<P>
 So Iwuoma sought identity and a sense of inclusion by hanging out with taggers 
and nonstop partyers. That led to estrangement from his parents and a one-year 
period of homelessness, during which he wandered the streets and slept wherever 
a friend could spare a couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 20-year-old Iwuoma is writing a monologue to express his personal 
frustration over identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwuoma and nine other young adults will present their monologues at the Los 
Angeles Theater Center at 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is part of the Human Services program, a project begun soon after the 
1992 riots in an effort to get young people involved in rebuilding the 
community. The program is funded by the Commission on National and Community 
Service implemented by the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Conservation Corps was instrumental in starting the program 
and expanding it beyond the original premise of cleanup. "Young people should 
help with more than cleaning . . . they should get involved with the root 
causes of the problems," said Carmelo Alvarez, Human Services program director. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty 18- to 23-year-olds from the inner city were recruited through 
community centers, homeless shelters and free clinics for the yearlong program. 
Because of the full-time commitment to the program, participants are paid 
minimum wage and are eligible for college scholarships after completion. 
</P>
<P>
 The first group of 20 graduated from the program last year and in November a 
new group was assembled. Calling itself the Human Services Tribe, the group has 
visited AIDS hospices, homeless shelters and gang hangouts to talk to youths 
and determine how to help the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribe has taken such steps as hosting a Casino Night at an AIDS hospice 
and assisting individuals on a more personal basis by writing letters for 
terminally ill patients and counseling would-be gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also helped entertain nervous youngsters at one of the emergency 
shelters set up after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming show, "Resistance 502," provides members of the multicultural 
group a way to express their inner emotions about identity while educating 
young people about the history of racial conflicts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members researched events of racial conflict from 1492, when Columbus 
arrived in North America, to the present; 502 reflects the number of years that 
have passed in that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Each member chose a historic event and a personality from that period to 
express their own personal turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwuoma chose to express himself through the character of a youth lashing out 
at police during the 1965 Watts riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "When are you going to realize we're people, man?" Iwuoma said during a 
rehearsal of his monologue. "We're proud black people . . . you can't beat it 
out of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Iwuoma said he still struggles with the concepts he voices in his monologue, 
but that the Human Services program has helped him become more self-assured. He 
has even reconciled with his parents, with whom he now lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter who you're following, as long as you follow yourself," said 
Iwuoma, who hopes to use the lessons he has learned in the program to 
eventually open his own homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This made me realize I can relate to my parents, as long as I see myself."

 The National Drama Company of Korea visits Los Angeles this week for a 
performance of the philosophical play "Pigo-jigo, Pigo-jigo" ("Bloom and 
Fade"). A portion of the proceeds will be donated to an earthquake relief fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama company, established in 1950, includes some of South Korea's most 
respected actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pigo-jigo, Pigo-jigo," written by Man-hee Lee and directed by Young-keol 
Kang, tells the story of three elderly men who ruminate on their lives, dreams 
and failures while robbing an ancient tomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The dialogue is in Korean, but an English summary of the story will be 
provided, said Chris Sim, president of Special Educational Tour & Events, the 
organization coordinating the troupe's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The play opens Friday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, 514 S. Spring St., 
and runs through May 2. Show times are 7 p.m. Friday and May 2, and 3 and 7

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: HARVARD HEIGHTS; SAFETY GROUP SEEKS TO FUND POLICE 
STATION

<P>
 A group concerned with public safety in Koreatown and the Mid-City area is 
organizing a campaign to fund a police substation and community center, 
possibly in a former bank building that is also on the wish list of other 
neighborhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koreatown Public Safety Assn. is laying the legal and organizational 
groundwork to raise the $2 million it estimates will be needed to establish an 
endowment to maintain and operate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The association hopes to acquire use of the building at 1819 S. Western Ave. 
through an arrangement between its owner, the Bank of America, and the city. 
</P>
<P>
 B of A, city officials and representatives from the Police Department and 
community groups have had preliminary discussions about using the building for 
community purposes. Bank officials said they are continuing to work with the 
Police Department on the disposition of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the public safety association's involvement, several neighborhood 
groups, including the Harvard Heights and Western Heights neighborhood 
associations, expressed interest in the building as a community center and 
recently painted over the graffiti on its walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ryan of the Los Angeles Community Reinvestment Group, which represents 
five local neighborhood associations and seeks to promote community 
reinvestment by financial institutions under the federal Community Reinvestment 
Act, said established neighborhood groups should be given the first opportunity 
to manage the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan pointed to a January, 1992, statement B of A made to the Federal Reserve 
System's Board of Governors, which states that the corporation would consider 
transferring closed branches to "a community-based, nonprofit organization on a 
case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said bank and police officials told him that the neighborhood groups lack 
the capacity to run the facility, but he said they are missing the point. 
"Institutions have to take a chance on this neighborhood," Ryan said. 
"Institutions not taking risks in this community is why we had the riots."  
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Police Department seems to have thrown its support behind the new 
public safety association. At a recent meeting, Assistant Chief Bernard Parks 
of the department's Office of Operations commended the group for its efforts to 
raise money for a police substation, something the cash-strapped department 
would be hard-pressed to do on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The public safety association, which draws most of its members from among 
Korean American clergy and community leaders, invites the public to participate 
in its campaign, said organizer Yohngsohk Choe. He stressed that it would not 
be a solely Korean effort, saying the association plans to add African 
Americans and Latinos to its board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intention is to find a home for all neighborhood associations," Choe 
said. "It's not only for Koreans. We have to raise the money so we can have a 
perpetual program with a clear objective and not just a short-term project." 
</P>
<P>
 George Richter, a member of the association, said: "We're all in the same boat 
when it comes to public safety. We want this to be a multiethnic effort and 
we're looking for partners throughout the community." JAKE DOHERTY

 Korean American workers who lost their jobs when businesses were damaged or 
destroyed in the 1992 riots are among the unrest's hidden victims, according to 
a survey to be released this week, and two out of five of them are still 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates asked a sample of displaced Korean American 
workers in December if they had found new jobs and what level of assistance 
they received from the government and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization contacted 151 displaced workers originally interviewed by the 
Korean American Inter-Agency Council in July, 1992. Of the 72 who responded to 
the telephone survey, 38.9% were still unemployed and, of the 44 who found new 
jobs, nine have found part-time employment and only four have found jobs with 
health, vacation and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Many merchants who suffered heavy damage during the riots are still reeling 
from its effects, but "we shouldn't lose sight of the losses suffered by 
workers who don't get the same attention and who have fewer resources to deal 
with this crisis," said Edward Park, the organization's director of research. 
</P>
<P>
 While 70% of the respondents received some assistance from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, 42% received disaster unemployment assistance.  
</P>
<P>
 Korean community organizations provided assistance to 60, or 83%, of the 
respondents, but only six reported receiving assistance from the Korean 
American Relief Fund, which mainly provided aid to business owners and has not 
disbursed all the funds it raised.  
</P>
<P>
 Slightly more than half of the respondents said their financial situation is 
"difficult" or "very difficult" and a majority expressed dissatisfaction with 
the level of assistance from federal, state and local governments and, for the 
most part, the Korean American community. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to expanded efforts to help displaced workers, "there needs to be 
more focus on getting Korean American workers out of the ethnic labor market" 
in which even those who find jobs face low wages, few benefits and difficult 
working conditions, said Park, a sociology professor who will teach at USC next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates, established in March, 1992, provides 
legal services, education, training, organizing assistance, research and 
advocacy for Korean-American workers. Additional findings from the survey will 
be released Thursday. JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; HOMEBOY TORTILLERIA CLOSES; FUNDS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The presses at the Homeboy Tortilleria have stopped rolling out the corn 
tortillas that kept at-risk Pico-Aliso youths employed when few other companies 
would hire them. Without fanfare, the workers cleaned out their space last week 
at Grand Central Market in Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, they had not made their own tortillas but were selling goods 
produced by another tortilla company and packaged under the Homeboy Industries 
name, said Father Gregory J. Boyle, director of the Dolores Mission's Jobs for 
a Future Program. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a very different scene when the tortilla stand was unveiled at the 
market's 75th anniversary celebration Oct. 5, 1992. Employees handed out 
buttons with the Homeboy logo and sold T-shirts to tout their new venture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tortilleria, which employed from eight to 10 workers, could not 
compete with the larger companies that produce millions of tortillas a day and 
sell them throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no money in tortillas, and there was no way we could keep up with the 
big guys," said Boyle, who returned from a 1 1/2-year sabbatical in January. 
"Now, we're focusing on bread." 
</P>
<P>
 The tortilleria workers have been placed in other jobs or are helping with 
renovation work at the Homeboy Bakery on Gless Street next to the mission. The 
bakery has been closed while the program raises money to replace old equipment 
and repair the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle needs to match a $125,000 grant from movie producer Ray Stark by the end 
of May to renovate the bakery and get it running again by summer. Boyle 
estimated that operating the bakery for six months will help the program recoup 
the losses of the tortilleria and the bakery renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Keri Murray, job developer with the Dolores Mission's Jobs for a Future 
Program, said organizers hope to sell specialty breads, such as rosemary and 
jalapeno/cheese, when the bakery reopens. The seven workers employed by the 
bakery had been using the Lithuanian rye and pumpernickel recipes of the Czech 
baker who ran his operation next to the Dolores Mission for more than 25 years 
before selling it to the jobs program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has agreements with restaurants, hospitals and university campuses 
to sell the bread, which will work out better than selling in a supermarket, 
Murray said, because the program will be paid whether the bread sells or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have every hope that were we to have that capital, we could triple the 
number of workers in the bakery," Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the flagship of the Jobs for a Future Program, where we try to find jobs 
for the youth in the community, as opposed to 'three strikes and you're out.' 
This is what reduces crime, and nobody knows that better than the people in 
this community." MARY ANNE PEREZ

 The Aliso-Pico Multipurpose Center is undergoing long-awaited repairs with a 
grant from the city approved last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old building at 1505 E. 1st St. will receive $40,000 from the city 
to replace plexiglass, carpeting and tile, and repair the roof, electrical 
system, air conditioning and parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "These repairs have been needed for about eight years and we've got a high 
volume of people coming through here," said director Johnny Odom. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, city crews have replaced some doors in the building and lights in the 
parking lot, and have done some work on the roofing and air conditioning 
system, Odom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last year also approved spending $175,000 for repairs at the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day 200 to 300 people pass through the center's doors to find housing, 
employment and food, and to attend tutoring and English as a Second Language 
classes. Summer programs include day trips to local attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is also home to a youth advocacy program, recreational 
activities, a prenatal care program and medical clinic. And a senior nutrition 
program serves 50 lunches a day. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; STUDENTS TO HOLD ART SHOW, AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students from the Mujeres y Hombres Nobles alternative high school will 
display their monoprints at a free reception from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Wednesday 
at Self-Help Graphics studio and then auction off their works. 
</P>
<P>
 For two months, teacher Jose Antonio Aguirre has taken students to the studio 
at 3802 Cesar E. Chavez Ave. to work with materials and equipment there to 
produce the works. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 students participated, said Assistant Principal Annie Cabrera. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really impressed at what they did," Cabrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if they thought they made a mistake, if they smeared the paint, the 
effect would be so beautiful. They'd say, 'Wow, I did that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The reception will include performances by teacher Olivia Chumacero and writer 
Maria Elena Gaitan. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are enrolled in a program designed to bring back into the 
classroom teen-agers who have dropped out of school, are on probation or are 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Muralist and mosaic artist Aguirre, 38, has been working with the teen-agers 
at Mujeres y Hombres Nobles since December. He has taught them silk-screen 
monoprints and said that the quality of their work is the same as some 
professional artists, which shows that some of the professionals have gotten 
lazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for the students in terms of showing what they can do, but a lot of 
people are feeling threatened by the students, which makes me happy," Aguirre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has given the students the chance they need to think positively 
about their futures, Aguirre said. Among his students, he has been able to see 
a change in attitude in the short time he's been there.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the things you hear there is, 'I can't do that,' and I'm trying to 
prove them otherwise," Aguirre said. "It's interesting to see some of the kids 
who are negative. They see the other ones (who will try something) and they 
start making a bigger effort. It's a challenge and they want to be a part of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his students wants to become a lawyer and another has talked about 
becoming a model, far different directions from where they were headed when 
they began. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that a lot of the kids are saving themselves through the 
program," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; RUN-DOWN PARK GETS NEW LEASE ON LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marilyn Nollan smiled as she described the change at Pico-Union Community 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids desperately needed a place to go after school, but the park was just 
this split-level park with mounds of dirt," said Nollan, who runs the Good 
Beginning Family Opportunity Center's day-care program next to the park. "I had 
to call the police a couple of times because we had problems with people 
hanging out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The park and center are nestled between rows of auto repair shops on South 
Hoover Avenue. Established by residents after the 1965 Watts riots, the park 
had become overrun by transients and gangs over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the park reopened last week with a new look after parents from the center 
and city officials remodeled it. Colorful slides, swings and sandboxes have 
sprouted on what had been a near-desolate lot. The supplies and the work were 
donated by businesses and individuals, City Councilman Mike Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to bring the park back because it's symbolic of the people in this 
area and their will to keep surviving in the place called Los Angeles," said 
Hernandez, whose district includes the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The park represents the latest success for parents at Good Beginnings, 
according to Lilian Payan, the center's project manager. "What we try and do 
here at the center is to also emphasize networking within the community and to 
teach parents what resources are available," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That has translated into day care and educational assistance for low-income 
families as well as an array of adult classes.  
</P>
<P>
 The center, at 1839 S. Hoover Ave., is a collaboration between the Los Angeles 
Conservation Corps, USC's School for Early Childhood Education and the United 
Neighborhood Council.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to have a place where our corps members with young children could 
go," said Amy Sedivy of the conservation corps. "This has been a really good 
thing for people in the neighborhood because they have a place to take their 
kids, and we've managed to increase parent involvement through things like the 
park." 
</P>
<P>
 The three organizations took over operation of the center in 1991 at the 
city's request. With an annual budget of $280,000 in federal and local funds, a 
staff of nine, including three teachers, provides day care for 3- to 
5-year-olds. Parents pay $40 a week for child care at the center, which is open 
daily from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Payne said the next step for parents at the center will be to lobby to have 
the park's name changed because it is in the Hoover-Adams area. SANDRA

 Residents in the 90002, 90059, 90061 and 90044 ZIP codes can now write Watts

 The move by the Postal Service follows a request from City Councilman Rudy

 Svorinich made the request in January, urging Postmaster General Marvin Runyon

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; GROUNDBREAKING FOR LONG-SOUGHT LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maureen Williams couldn't believe her eyes last week when she saw the lot at 
102nd Street and Compton Avenue crowded with city officials declaring that a 
new library would soon fill the space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it would be built," said Williams, a 45-year resident of the 
neighborhood. "But eventually it had to be built because it's needed so badly 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a year, Williams and other residents have walked past the billboard 
heralding the site for the new Watts Branch Library. Nine months of delays 
because of funding and other problems had residents questioning the future of 
the lot at 10205 Compton Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday, Williams watched as community activists and city officials, 
including Councilman Rudy Svornich Jr. and his predecessor, Joan Milke-Flores, 
proclaimed the library a reality during the groundbreaking ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you think of a library in Watts, think of it as the inner-city mecca in 
the middle of charcoal alley," said Alma Woods, president of the Friends of the 
Watts Branch Library, referring to the stretch of 103rd Street destroyed in the 
1965 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The new library is scheduled to open by the fall, 1995, as part of the 
1.3-acre Westminster Watts Civic Center office complex. The complex will 
include several banks, as well as a family-style restaurant, although the 
project's developer, the Westminster Neighborhood Assn., has yet to find a 
restaurant group willing to commit to the space. 
</P>
<P>
 Project manager Keith Dillard said he expects construction to begin by June. 
The 12,500-square-foot library, with shelving for 45,000 books, will be nearly 
three times the size of the existing library at 1501 E. 103rd St. and will 
include a community meeting room and a new automated circulation system. 
</P>
<P>
 For many such as Woods and Williams, the new library and complex are part of a 
changing image for Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world must know we're an asset to society, not a liability," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 For others it signals the fulfillment of promises made following the Watts 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this represents a phase in the changes our community has made since 
1965 and a continuation of the promises made between residents and officials to 
collaborate and influence the future of this area," said James Woods of the 
Watts Towers Community Action Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The new $2.8-million library is funded through a $1.5-million Community 
Redevelopment Agency grant and $1.3 million from a 1989 bond measure. SANDRA

<P>
 Pius X High School officials say they have devised a plan that may quiet the 
controversy surrounding adult soccer tournaments at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic high school of 510 students has come under fire from South Gate 
residents who say California Soccer Assn. tournaments there have drawn rowdy 
crowds who park cars in their driveways and dump beer cans and dirty diapers on 
their lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Pius X is at 7851 E. Gardendale St. in Downey, but the athletic field faces a 
residential South Gate neighborhood. The school has leased its field for small 
adult soccer tournaments over the past four years with relatively few 
complaints, said Principal Michael Parmer. But within the last six months, the 
school has hosted two tournaments that attracted large corporate sponsors, 
purses of up to $15,000 and nearly 3,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors recently submitted a 37-signature petition to South Gate police that 
criticized the events. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, school officials met with the police chiefs of South Gate and 
Downey, campus staff and a California Soccer Assn. representative last week to 
devise a plan that will be discussed at an upcoming community forum. The 
meeting will be scheduled before the next game on May 14, said Parmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes banning parking along Gardendale Street, adding off-duty 
police officers for security during the games, prohibiting alcohol and 
providing extra bleachers and bathroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Parmer would not reveal how much the school makes from leasing the field but 
said that the school also receives a percentage of the gate and 
concession-stand proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported receiving few complaints until the school recently began 
hosting larger tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents say they have been accused of opposing the games because of the 
almost exclusively Latino crowd that they attract. But Elisabeth Bowman, an 
outspoken critic of the games who helped circulate the petition, said the issue 
"is not racial."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from Germany and we like soccer too," said Bowman, 61, whose daughter 
graduated from Pius X. "But this is a little street and this is not a football 
field for professionals. It's just a little school." MARY HELEN BERG

dissipated throughout central Los Angeles two years ago, the city's minority 
communities heeded the wake-up call to take care of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 They turned inward to heal their wounds, establish organizations and 
coalitions, and beef up their social and political muscle. Inclusion was the 
first order of business. Unity with other racial and ethnic groups would come 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the two years since rioting rocked Los Angeles' already shaky 
multicultural foundation, that unity has been slow to emerge. Racial dividing 
lines are as strong as before the unrest, and few efforts to cross those lines 
-- or even just blur them -- exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The politics in this town have become more 'racialized,' " said attorney and 
activist Angela Oh, pointing to a number of incidents in the past two years 
that have widened racial gaps.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't hear or see any more examples of diverse communities now really 
working together." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no studies or opinion polls to show who's talking to whom or what 
ethnic or racial organizations are working together to seal the racial rifts, 
but there have been pockets of change: a handful of multiethnic efforts that 
are slowly progressing; multiracial discussions on college campuses, and quiet, 
small-scale programs that evolved into multiethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation also has created two different schools of thought -- those who 
believe it is imperative to move now to create interracial and inter-ethnic 
coalitions among the city's Asian American, Latino and African American 
communities, and those who say they must first strengthen their own communities 
before joining the collective effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tendency for communities to encircle the wagons after a crisis. 
That has not been a very successful approach," said Jorge Mancillas, an 
assistant professor of anatomy and cell biology at UCLA. "The successes we've 
witnessed in bringing about any kind of progress, in bringing change to the 
social structure of L.A., has happened when people cross ethnic lines." 
</P>
<P>
 An example, Mancillas said, was last year's highly publicized 14-day hunger 
strike at UCLA, in which Mancillas joined seven students to protest Chancellor 
Charles Young's decision not to create a Chicano studies department. Another 
example would be the rallies by Local 11 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees 
Union, which has a large Latino membership. 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreement over whether to move ahead quickly or to take more time to 
forge a multicultural effort has not impeded some groups from working together, 
although it has slowed some inter-ethnic discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many community leaders point to the racial and ethnic gridlock among the 
city's political circles as part of the reason for the absence of a mass 
multiethnic movement. What's needed to break that gridlock, they say, is a 
stronger commitment from politicians to move toward mending the racial 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a sense of vision from City Hall about seeking to put together or 
work on a plan to get rid of racial divisions," said Gary Phillips, co-director 
of the Multicultural Collaborative.  
</P>
<P>
 Constance L. Rice, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, 
said common ground between groups can only be found by organizing with each 
other. "It's not just flash-point issues, it's long-term resolutions," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an October, 1992, Times Poll, nearly one-third of Angelenos said 
they believed ethnic minorities could make more progress by strengthening their 
own communities rather than building coalitions with other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inward-looking issues are not necessarily polarizing, but it's a 
development that needs to happen in order to have a multicultural community," 
said Debbie Ching, president of the Asian Pacific Planning Council. "Each 
community has to have a strong voice and organization for communication to 
flow." 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which was established before the riots, is a multiethnic effort 
of about 10 groups within the Asian and Pacific Islander community. It 
initially dealt with health care, but the unrest prompted the organization to 
broaden its scope and get more involved in human relations work. Part of that 
expansion has included collaborating with other Asian American groups to hold 
multicultural talks, such as a recent round-table discussion at UCLA on race 
relations in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prominent arena for multiracial dialogue has been on university 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In academic circles they're talking about a wide range of multiethnic 
issues," Oh said. "Everything from 'women of color' to 'how do small ethnic 
communities deal with all the attitudes they confront?' It doesn't work as well 
in public lives because dialogue is an intangible thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For the 2-year-old Multicultural Collaborative, dialogue has worked. It has 
forged discussions between ethnic organizations, community leaders and 
academics to affect policy and mend social and racial rifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a multicultural, multiracial group seeking solutions to human 
relations when there's still little commitment to human relations by anyone 
else," said Larry Aubry, former consultant for the Los Angeles County Human 
Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaborative was formed after the riots as a think tank to study 
multiracial relationships in the city and work on solutions to inter-ethnic 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with few similar efforts being made to create racial and ethnic ties, 
the collaborative ended up being pulled in several directions during its first 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't expect to create an activist structure," said Manuel Pastor, one of 
the founders of the Multicultural Collaborative and a member of the New 
Majority, a multiethnic organization founded before the riots. "We kept seeing 
issues arise and looked in that direction. But we're now narrowing our focus." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since early last year, the collaborative has held about half a dozen community 
forums discussing policy, community empowerment, development issues and other 
topics as they affect each of the city's racial communities. Its three 
co-directors -- one African American, one Asian American and one Latino -- have 
been involved in community groups for several years and work with various 
ethnic community-based organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk to each other beyond race and ethnic lines," said Rice, of the 
Legal Defense & Education Fund. "There is a pluralistic ethos being developed." 
</P>
<P>
 There are various ways of achieving such pluralism. One such effort is the 
Pico-Union Improvement Assn. Prompted by riot destruction in the neighborhood 
and Pico-Union's longstanding problems with crime, Mike Hoy and other community 
residents mobilized to improve the area. 
</P>
<P>
 They formed the association, a Neighborhood Watch group whose mission is to 
rid the 2.5-square-mile area of crime and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw my Neighborhood Watch group disappear. I observed a lot of groups in 
Pico-Union doing different things, but they weren't coordinated and working 
together," said Hoy, who is white and has lived in Pico-Union for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Hoy, the core group of organizers included one African American 
and two Latinos. Most of the group's 200 members are Latino, but also 
participating are a handful of whites and African Americans who are either 
residents or merchants in the area bounded by 7th Street on the north, the 
Santa Monica Freeway on the south, the Harbor Freeway on the east and Normandie 
Avenue on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about race; it's about people who live and work here and want to 
make some positive changes," said Hoy, coordinator of the group. "But I guess 
that's almost the same goal for multiracial plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Improving ethnic relations in addition to imparting business know-how is part 
of a fledgling plan for training future teen-age entrepreneurs. Every Saturday, 
nearly 40 Korean, Latino and African American teen-agers get a joint lesson in 
cultural understanding and business savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 The two issues are inseparable if a business is going to survive in the city, 
especially in central Los Angeles, said Bernard Braddy, a representative of the 
Community Coalition Against Substance Abuse and co-coordinator of the 
Multicultural Youth Business Job Creation Venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a joint effort between the Korean Youth and Community Center 
and the Community Coalition. Its goal is to break down stereotypes and give 
youths business insight. The project began in February, 1993, although it was 
proposed before the civil unrest, Braddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the basic ways groups will be coming together will be through economic 
development," he said. "And issues of poverty and unemployment will divide 
people because there are serious class differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the tension that surrounds conflicts between racial and ethnic groups 
is sparked by the lack of equal financial footing, said Jackie Dupont-Walker, a 
former consultant with RLA, formerly Rebuild L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh agreed, adding that language barriers are also a factor. "People are being 
driven by economic fear, and our inability to communicate in the most 
fundamental way inhibits us from breaking through to each other," she said. 
"So, for vast inter-ethnic dialogue, it might be too early." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the Asian American community, Asian Pacific Americans for a New L.A. 
has moved ahead with comprehensive efforts to mend wounds among some of the 
city's Asians and within the city's Asian community as a whole. A coalition of 
more than 40 community-based organizations, APANLA has been politically active 
since it was created in May, 1992, to assure that riot victims' issues were 
being addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization has been working with Asian merchants whose liquor stores 
were destroyed during the riots and are now trying to convert them to 
self-serve laundries. It was also influential in lobbying for Linda Wong to be 
hired as a consultant at RLA. 
</P>
<P>
 But APANLA's progress, like most organizations born from the ashes of April 
29, 1992, has moved slowly, mired in meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling Latino Unity Forum has encountered the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization began in June, 1992, to build bridges among Latino immigrant 
populations throughout the county, but it spent its first year dealing with 
internal snafus and figuring out its direction and purpose. Only now has it 
found a niche that will guide it through the next several years, its directors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During its first year, the forum, comprised of some of the more prominent 
community activists in the city's Latino sector, remained low-key and focused 
on "organizational matters," said the forum's current chairman, David Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancillas of UCLA was briefly involved with the forum during its infancy in 
1992 but criticized the group because of its lack of activism in the Latino 
community in the first few months after it was created. 
</P>
<P>
 The group went through considerable growing pains that first year, losing 
two-thirds of its membership and dealing with a change in leadership that put 
Jimenez at the helm. It is now on better footing to move forward, Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're at a point now where we can stand publicly on an issue," he 
said. "We want to be on the proactive and not reactive approach." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's ultimate goal is to put together a collective federation similar 
to the Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles, said Latino Unity Forum 
director Hector Perez-Pacheco. It has also held several informal meetings with 
members of APANLA, continuing the inter-ethnic dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to tell what inroads the Latino Unity Forum will make. 
</P>
<P>
 Its immediate plans are to create a networking infrastructure for Latino 
organizations and agencies throughout the county and to be more representative 
and vocal about Latino issues, particularly immigrant-bashing, Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complicated issue," he added. "It's our collective nature to take care 
of (our) own first. We want to know what we're doing first before going out and 
saying five different things to five different groups on five different days. 
So when you meet, you speak with a collective mind. We need more time to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Several group leaders and community activists complain that two years is not 
enough time to see the fruits of anyone's labor.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who knows anything about community development knows that two years 
is nothing," Dupont-Walker said. "Yes, you should be able to see some 
progression, but in some ways it's as if we want instant gratification, and 
that's crazy. It takes time to piece these things together." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Villalobos of Barrio Planners, an urban planning firm in East Los 
Angeles, said: "Two years is only enough time to document the birth and maybe 
the staying power of some of these organizations. It's hard to size up success 
at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 The best assessment of progress in bridging the gaps among the city's ethnic 
communities will be to revisit them five years after the riots, said Pastor, 
who is a professor at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor said he is hopeful that in the next three years there will be extensive 
inter-ethnic cooperation on economic issues and significant alliances between 
blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see indications that in the next couple of years we will be able to break 
through," Mancillas said with guarded optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez had fewer expectations, but more basic and fundamental solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our multiethnic situation (in Los Angeles) is almost a national 
treasure," he said. "I don't know if there's one simple solution. But I know 
what we don't do. We don't cut each other down. We don't bash each other's 
efforts."

BILL TO BAN MALT LIQUOR, FORTIFIED WINES STALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Legislation that would restrict the sale of fortified wines and malt liquor in 
South-Central and in certain parts of Northern California suffered a setback 
last week in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Bill 2698 was expected to go before the Governmental Organization 
Committee for a vote Tuesday, but the bill's supporters postponed any action, 
acknowledging that they lacked the necessary votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is intended to strengthen the Department of Alcohol Beverage Control 
by beefing up the agency's authority to impose fines and enforce conditions on 
problem stores. The bill would also establish a pilot program that would 
prohibit the sale of fortified wine and malt liquor in South-Central and in 
downtown Oakland for a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill is still alive, but it's been very difficult trying to persuade 
rural representatives or those who have been unduly influence by the industry 
that this is a problem that needs to be addressed," said George Wiley, a 
consultant to the committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the state liquor agency could limit stores' hours of 
operation, the type of alcohol sold and require security guards. The agency 
could also impose fines on store owners who do not comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really worried about the bill because I already have conditions 
placed on the store," said Hyok Kwan, manager of the Lucky Liquor Store at 1471 
Jefferson Blvd. "I don't know much about the bill, but I don't think it will 
help people here because they will just find another place to buy those strong 
wines." 
</P>
<P>
 A major stumbling block for the bill has been the proposed pilot program in 
South-Central and in Oakland, Wiley said. He said the bill's author, 
Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood), is considering limiting the 
pilot program to South-Central in an effort to move it through the Assembly.  
</P>
<P>
 The bill will remain in committee until next month, when it is expected to 
come up again for consideration, Wiley said. Tucker introduced the bill in 
February.

AT LAST, AN ANSWER TO 'WHAT GOES?'; EDUCATION: DISTRICT AND MTA UNVEIL PLANS TO 
OPEN TRANSPORTATION ACADEMIES AT THREE SITES, INCLUDING WILSON AND LOCKE HIGH 
SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Los Angeles 
Unified School District have announced an ambitious plan to open transportation 
academies at three schools, including Wilson and Locke high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 With money from the federal Department of Education and the Federal Transit 
Administration, the schools will open at Wilson, Locke and North Hollywood high 
schools after teachers and staff devise the curriculum this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson teachers hope to begin offering specialized classes geared toward 
transportation careers by February. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers who will work in the academies have been learning about 
transportation and occupations in the field in meetings over the past year with 
the MTA staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson English and journalism teacher Monica Studer said that one of the 
program's goals is to ensure that local designers, engineers and architects can 
work on future Los Angeles transportation projects. A lack of local people in 
those fields has forced the MTA to search elsewhere, Studer said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to educate kids to work not just in Los Angeles but anywhere, 
in any transportation system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will receive $4 million for the next four years from the federal 
agencies, said Naomi Nightingale, MTA manager for education and job training. 
The three academies will have room for 600 students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will spend $200,000 to renovate a welding classroom to include office 
and lecture space, a bank of computers, computer-aided design drafting 
equipment and an area for airbrushing architectural plans. The academy will 
offer classes in social studies, history, architecture, math, physics, 
journalism, Spanish and English, all with an emphasis on transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a history class, we might not necessarily talk about how the Pilgrims 
landed on Plymouth Rock, but we can talk about how transportation was key to 
the development of this country from east to west," Nightingale said.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike magnet schools, which attract students throughout the district to one 
school, the academies will only be offered to students who attend those three 
schools, Nightingale said. 
</P>
<P>
 The academies will bring together vocational and college-bound students to 
give both groups a sufficient background in transportation. Students will also 
be able to work in summer jobs and internships in related fields.  
</P>
<P>
 The academies are an extension of the Transportation Occupation Program 
established in 1985 by the MTA and school districts in Los Angeles, Compton and 
Long Beach to give students an opportunity to take 12 additional hours a week 
of study for a year to land jobs in the industry.

THEY'RE FAST, SHARP AND READY -- FOR HIGH SCHOOL; BASKETBALL: AIDED BY A NEW 
DISTRICT ENROLLMENT RULE, TALENTED NINTH-GRADERS ARE LOOKING TO TRANSFER INTO 
PROGRAMS THAT WILL MAKE GOOD USE OF THEIR SKILLS.

 It seems so innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior high students dribbling down the court, throwing no-look passes, making 
reverse layups and calling one another nicknames such as Baby Shaq and Baby 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 But these baby-ballers range from 5-foot-7 to 6-4, can touch the rim and 
outshoot their fathers in a game of HORSE. 
</P>
<P>
 They are only ninth-graders, but they will soon be household names at 
perennial high school powers Crenshaw, Dorsey, Fremont and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Imari Washington of Horace Mann, Aaron Riley of James Foshay and Quincy Brown 
of Charles Drew are three of the area's top junior high basketball players. 
They recently competed in the sixth annual After-School Alternative Program 
basketball tournament, organized by Muir Junior High teacher Ed Cabil. The 
tournament is sponsored by New Alternatives for Drug and Gang Elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, a 6-2 center, scored 21 points to lead Horace Mann to a 46-39 win 
over Drew in the ninth-grade boys' finals Wednesday at Washington High. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these young stars are 15 or younger, but they have already been 
scrutinized by talent evaluators. Beginning with the 1994-95 school year, Los 
Angeles Unified School District students will no longer have to attend 
neighboring high schools or receive a permit to go to a school outside their 
area. They can attend any school within the district, providing the school has 
room for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Area basketball coaches who attended the tournament believe the 
open-enrollment rule will intensify the recruiting of Central City athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (school district) has ruined the idea of neighborhood schools," said Drew 
Junior High Coach John Kamae. "Recruiting will become a bigger problem because 
kids will be electing to look at schools outside their neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Even first-year Locke Coach Mike Crumline agreed: "I think the district made a 
mistake. If they think they had a problem with recruiting before, they're going 
to have a serious problem now. The thing that makes it bad is that, at this 
age, basketball should be something that is fun. Now we're putting pressure on 
kids to make a decision I'm not sure they're old enough to make." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, students who attended Horace Mann went to Crenshaw. Foshay has 
been a feeder school to Dorsey and Manual Arts, and Drew students went to Locke 
or Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 With the change in district rules, students can shop around to choose the 
school that best fits their athletic and academic needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he sat quietly in the stands, Crumline was one of four coaches who 
made his presence felt. Dorsey boys' Coach Kevin Gibson and Fremont girls' 
Coach Mat Taylor also attended the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said he wanted to "advertise" his interest in the players. "If you 
don't show up, kids are going to think I'm not interested in them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gibson disagreed with the idea that open enrollment will affect the 
distribution of players to area schools. "Kids can go wherever they want," he 
said. "All they have to do is enroll in a magnet program. There's not too much 
influence from one school to another." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington boys' Coach Andy Davis, whose school hosted the tournament, said 
that open enrollment will affect the minor sports more than football or 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top players are going to schools with the highest profile, especially 
with open enrollment," he said. "You give a player a choice between Duke, 
Arkansas and Rider, where do you think he's going to go? It's the same with 
high school basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think the biggest impact will be felt in the minor sports like tennis, 
volleyball and cross-country." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the top junior high players are narrowing their list of schools. Others 
remain indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter. I just want to go to school and play," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Hawthorne, a 6-2 1/2 center at Drew, wants to go to Fremont but is also 
considering Locke, Dorsey and Westchester because his friends go there. 
Teammate Davon Benjamin, a 5-7 point guard, lists Westchester, Locke and 
Fremont as his top choices. Brian Webb, a 6-1 forward, likes Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, of Horace Mann, wants to go to Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
 Foshay point guard Johnny Chavarria is part of the USC Academic Initiative and 
has been directed by the program to attend Los Angeles or Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one of the players interviewed mentioned Crenshaw, which has won two 
consecutive State Division I Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 So are these players as innocent as Crumline believes? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "I'm considering Locke and Fremont, but you will have to talk to 
my sister. She's my agent."

BACK ON TRACK; CAL STATE L.A. SPRINTER BARRY SMITH IS IN TOP FORM AGAIN AFTER A 
LONG FIGHT WITH HODGKIN'S DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The odds were against Barry Smith before he entered the starting blocks for 
the 200 meters in the 1990 State junior college finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles College freshman finished third but was convinced he 
would have won if not for a tactical mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mad because I should have come off the turn stronger," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt he had the ability. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also had Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after the finals Smith took on the most grueling challenge of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent one operation to have a tumor removed from his neck and another 
to have his spleen removed. 
</P>
<P>
 He went for radiation treatment five days a week -- 137 sessions from July 
through December. The first sessions focused on his head and neck, and then as 
the months wore on, his chest and stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was throwing up every five minutes because of the radiation, but I never 
missed a treatment," said Smith, 23. "I hated it. I was marking the days off 
the calendar until I would be a free man. You lose your sense of smell and 
sense of taste and everything tastes like dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who finished therapy two days before Christmas, 1990, will have 
checkups every six months for the rest of his life. But all signs indicate he 
is in remission. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% to 80% of Hodgkin's disease patients survive for at least five years 
after treatment. If the condition is treated successfully at an early stage, 
like Smith's, the disease is apparently cured. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the radiation treatments sent tingling sensations throughout his 
body for more than a year, but they are gone. The only visible signs are scars 
on his neck and abdomen from incisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel bitter for what happened," Smith said. "Everything happens for a 
reason. I guess God wanted to see how strong I was. I learned what life is all 
about and to take every step with each breath." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's first warning came during an athletics physical at East L.A. College 
in March, 1990. He was cleared to compete in track but was referred to a nose, 
throat and ear specialist because of a lump on his neck. Smith saw several 
other physicians before the diagnosis was made more than two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith continued to compete, trying to keep his illness a secret from his 
coaches and teammates. But by the time the State meet rolled around, a growth 
the size of a golf ball had developed in the left side of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't practice at all because I was always at the doctor taking tests," 
Smith said. "I knew the State meet was my last race of the season and I wasn't 
going to compete for a long time. I never worried about dying. The only thing I 
stressed out about was when I would be back on the track." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be many months and many ordeals later. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation for treatment in Long Beach posed a problem for Smith, who 
lives in Monterey Park. The effects of the radiation made him too ill to drive. 
He took the bus until drivers refused to let him on because of his constant 
vomiting. The American Cancer Society eventually provided Smith with taxi 
vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-9 former State high school champion lost his hair and watched his 
weight drop from 165 pounds to 114. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's parents, Uera and Thelma, repeatedly asked him to return home to San 
Francisco while he was undergoing treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom cried when I told her I had cancer, but I told her I could get through 
it alone," said Smith, the second-youngest of 10 children. "My parents can't 
live with me forever, and I didn't want to burden my mom to see me the way I 
was." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hodgkin's disease is a cancer that attacks the lymph nodes and other lymph 
tissues. Three new cases per 100,000 people are diagnosed in the United States 
each year. The disease is more common in men and usually strikes people in 
their 20s and those between 55 and 77. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's Hodgkin's disease was classified as "A-1," the least dangerous form. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of Hodgkin's disease is unknown. Smith's grandmother died of cancer 
and he speculates the cause may have been hereditary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was saying my prayers," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I died, I thought at least I accomplished something getting out of the 
ghettos in San Francisco and going to college." 
</P>
<P>
 A physical education major, Smith did not return to school full time until 
last year at Long Beach City College. Doctors told Smith he would be able to 
return to competition in a year. But it turned out to be two. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was open for debate whether Smith could return to the form of his 
senior season at San Francisco Mission High, where he won the 200 in the 1989 
State meet and ran a meet record in the 100 meters in the preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran in all-comer meets and didn't do too well," Smith said. "I was so happy 
just to run; I could have been last and not been disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith surpassed those expectations last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He ran a personal best in the 200 of 20.63 seconds and advanced to the 
semifinals in the event in last June's USA Track and Field national 
championships in Eugene, Ore., competing in a heat that included Carl Lewis, 
1992 Olympic champion Mike Marsh and former 100 world record-holder Leroy 
Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also ran 10.37 in the 100 last year, just .03 seconds off his best. 
</P>
<P>
 In the State junior college championship, Smith finished second in the 100 and 
the 200 and ran on Long Beach City's victorious 400-meter relay team to help 
the Vikings to the state title. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith trained occasionally over the last two years at Cal State L.A. but did 
not take up Coach Kevin McCarthy's offer to compete for the Golden Eagles until 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would see him working out and told him he would be always welcome if he 
needed a school to go to," McCarthy said. "I left an open door for him and he 
accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of Smith, McCarthy is optimistic about the Golden Eagles' 
chances for knocking off four-time defending champion Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championships in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Barry does well at (the NCAA Division II) nationals, we'll do well at 
nationals, especially the relays," said McCarthy, who is hoping for a top-five 
national finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Such optimism was evident April 17 at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays. 
Smith anchored the Golden Eagles' 400 relay team to a mark of 40.52 -- the 
second-fastest college time in the state this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year showed me I could run in the low 10s and 20s if I was healthy," 
Smith said. "I want to do well at nationals. I feel I can run with anybody when 
I get in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've beaten what I've beaten, it's hard not to think that way."

TRACK; HONOR IS THE LATEST COUP DE GRANVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The accolades keep coming for Michael Granville. The Bell Gardens High 
sophomore has been named the Indoor Athlete of the Year by Track & Field News 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Granville set a sophomore record of 57.7 seconds in the 500 yards 
in the Sunkist Invitational. Last month, he ran 1:51.11 in the 800 meters in 
the National Scholastic Indoor championships in Syracuse, N.Y., to cut 3.17 
seconds off the sophomore record move into third on the all-time high school 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville hasn't lost a step outdoors, either. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after winning the 800 in the Arcadia Invitational for the second time 
in a row, Granville clocked a personal-best 46.65 seconds to win the 400 meters 
at the April 15 Mt. San Antonio College Relays. The mark was the meet's fastest 
time in more than 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, who ran 47.24 in the 400 last year to establish a State freshman 
record, also finished third in the 200 meters in 21.75. Jim McElroy of 
Washington was fourth in 21.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Clarence Scott of Fremont recorded the City's top mark this season 
in the long jump, leaping 23 feet to finish third. 
</P>
<P>
 City cross-country champion Ricardo Valenzuela anchored Belmont to third in 
the 6,400-meter relay (18:09.04) and fifth in the distance medley relay 
(10:44.27). 
</P>
<P>
 Keisha Griffis of Washington was fourth in the 300-meter hurdles (46.18) and 
third in her heat of the 100 hurdles in 15.37. Jason Barreda of Loyola was 
fifth in the 3,000 meters in 8:49.69. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Los Angeles men recorded the fifth-fastest times in school 
history in the 400- and 1,600-meter relays in the University/Open Division of 
the April 17 Mt. SAC Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Benitez, John Hensley, Glenn Stewart and Keadrick Washington timed 
3:09.91 in the 1,600-meter relay to pace the Golden Eagles to their first 
victory in the event in the meet's 37-year history.

HOT PROPERTY: STILL 'WHEELING' AND DEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MERV GRIFFIN, who donated 104 acres of land in Benedict Canyon to the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy earlier this year, has sold his Beverly Hills home 
of eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer/talk-show host-turned-mogul owns the Beverly Hilton hotel, new 
riverboat casinos in Louisiana and Illinois, and a hotel-casino in Atlantic 
City. Griffin, 68, is also executive producer of the TV game shows "Jeopardy" 
and "Wheel of Fortune," both of which he created. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold his Beverly Hills home "because he wanted to spend more time in La 
Quinta, where he has his ranch," a Griffin spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederic Rosen, chairman of Ticketmaster, bought the Beverly Hills home, on 
three acres, for $7.5 million, including the trade of Rosen's former Beverly 
Hills residence, valued at about $2 million, sources say. Griffin, who can stay 
at the Hilton when in town, is expected to put that house back on the market. 
It was once listed at $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The home that Griffin sold was for sale in 1989 at $20 million, the same price 
he was asking in 1990 for his Benedict Canyon land. "He was planning a huge 
compound (there) . . . but decided it wasn't worth the money, time or effort, 
because he's never home, he's such an entrepreneur," his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, who also has a home in the Carmel Valley, decided to make the 
160-acre La Quinta ranch his Southern California residence because he goes 
there every weekend to watch his 18 Arabian horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he had put so much into La Quinta," his spokesman said. Griffin had the 
Moroccan-style house, guest cabanas and stables built, then almost entirely 
rebuilt after a fire during construction six years ago, about the time he 
bought the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin had purchased his Beverly Hills home through probate court for $5 
million in cash. The 10,000-square-foot Georgian colonial had been owned by the 
late Liliore B. Rains, a daughter of Beverly Hills co-founder Burton Green. An 
avid tennis player, Griffin had a tennis pavilion and sunken tennis court built 
after he had the 1940s-era mansion refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer ROBERT EVANS ("Sliver," "The Two Jakes"), who recently completed his 
autobiography, "The Kid Stays in the Picture," about his highly publicized ups 
and downs, has put his Beverly Hills home of 27 years on the market at $5.95 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, 63, was one of Hollywood's golden boys during the '60s and '70s when he 
was a top executive at Paramount. He has been credited with making the studio a 
powerhouse with such hits as "The Godfather," "Love Story" and "Chinatown," 
which won him personal acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, it was said that more deals were put together in the 
projection room of his home and on his tennis court than at any studio. He also 
married and divorced actresses Sharon Hugueny, Camilla Sparv, Ali MacGraw, then 
TV host/former Miss America Phyllis George. 
</P>
<P>
 Depression from a drug-possession conviction, financial woes (stemming from 
"The Cotton Club" film, which he co-produced in 1984) and the Cotton Club 
murder case, in which he was implicated but never charged, led Evans to take a 
professional hiatus, which ended in 1991 when he signed a five-year production 
deal with Paramount, starting with "Sliver" (1993). 
</P>
<P>
 Evans sold his Beverly Hills home in 1989 but continued to live in it as a 
renter for 10 months, when he repurchased it. He had seller's remorse almost as 
soon as escrow closed but was unable to talk the buyer, international 
businessman Tony Murray, into selling it back. Five months later, actor Jack 
Nicholson, a friend of Evans', flew to Monte Carlo and convinced Murray to let 
Evans buy the house the following January. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans won't change his mind about selling this time, sources say, because he 
is ready to move on now that he has completed his autobiography and is starting 
two new films for Paramount, including the Joe Eszterhas thriller "Jade." He is 
also in the process of buying a 57-acre horse ranch in Montecito and a 
penthouse in Los Angeles, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1941, his Beverly Hills home is a 16-room, one-story French Normandy 
on 1.6 acres, with waterfalls, 300-foot-high eucalyptus trees and 2,000 rose 
bushes. Kurt Rappaport of Nourmand & Associates, Beverly Hills, has the 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
 JACK BERNSTEIN, who co-produced the 1992 films "The Mambo Kings" and "Under 
Siege," and his wife, Sunny, have sold their Encino home of five years for 
their asking price of $625,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-bedroom, 3,500-square-foot home, nestled in the hills, was sold to 
Michael Sheller, an architect with the Jerde Partnership in Venice, and his 
wife, Geannie. The Bernsteins are moving to Mercer Island in the state of 
Washington, said listing agent Mike Glickman of Jon Douglas Co.'s Encino 
office. Jan Reichmann of Rodeo Realty represented the buyers.

HOME SALES HIT HIGHEST POINT IN NEARLY 3 YEARS

<P>
 Home sales in Southern California surged to their highest level in almost 
three years last month as buyers scrambled to take advantage of low mortgage 
interest rates, a real estate information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 19,557 new and used houses and condos were sold in Los Angeles, 
Orange, Ventura, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties in March. 
That was up 50.5% from 12,998 in February and up 38.6% from 14,106 in March a 
year ago, according to La Jolla-based Dataquick Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 March was the eighth month in a row that year-over-year sales were up, and it 
was the strongest single sales month since May, 1991, when 20,531 Southland 
homes were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "The upturn in mortgage interest rates pushed a lot of potential buyers into 
the market," said Donald L. Cohn, Dataquick CEO. "Additionally, prices for many 
types of homes are the lowest they have been in five years." 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in prices seems to be leveling off in certain areas and for 
certain types of homes, Dataquick analysts said. In San Diego County, 
year-over-year prices moved up for the fourth month in a row. The move-up home 
category is also seeing level price trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Dataquick monitors all real estate purchasing and financing activity in 
California and other states and provides information to lending institutions, 
title companies and industry analysts. The numbers include all so-called 
arms-length transactions. Sales to immediate family members and transfers of 
ownership to trusts are not counted. March Home, Condo Sales and Prices Chart

APARTMENT LIFE: MUST LANDLORD ACCEPT PARTIAL PAYMENTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA), 
an apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I am leaving my Simi Valley apartment at the end of April and I have 
some problems. Rent is usually due on the first of the month, but I paid 87%, 
$650 out of $750, of my rent on April 5 pursuant to a verbal agreement that it 
had to be paid no later than the 5th. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, I gave the manager a note indicating my intention to pay the 
balance of the rent by the 7th. On the night of the 6th, at 9 p.m., the manager 
knocked at my door and handed me a Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. 
</P>
<P>
 I happened to have the balance of the rent at the time so I offered to give it 
to her. She said that they did not accept partial rent payments and that she 
could not physically accept the rent. She said I should put it in the drop box 
at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked her why, if they did not accept partial rent payments, did she not 
have a refund of the partial payment I made the day before. She said, "You will 
have to speak to may superiors regarding that matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a legal way to do business? Also, can she charge a flat $25 late fee 
and a $20 processing fee for the forms I was handed? Do I have any options or 
must I pay these fees? (I included $10 with the balance of my rent payment, 
which I consider fair, as a late penalty.) 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: First, never make a verbal agreement about paying the rent when there 
is a written agreement about it. They are almost impossible to prove if denied 
by the other party and will usually be disregarded in the presence of a written 
agreement spelling out rent payment procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 While landlords are not required to accept partial rent payments, they cannot 
accept one on one day and refuse one the next. In any event, since they 
ultimately accepted your rent payment, that's not an issue. Also, the manager 
need not accept rent at your apartment if you always pay it at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Late fees are customary and legal. They must be reasonable, however, and 
should be specified in the lease or rental agreement. A late fee of $25 on a 
rent of $750, or about 3% of the rent, is probably legal and reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the lease or rental agreement probably contains language indicating 
that the renter is responsible for fees and costs, including processing fees, 
when actions are undertaken as the result of his transgressions, such as the 
late payment of rent. They can probably charge you for the processing fee, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Your options are limited. Since you are moving at the end of the month, they 
will likely deduct the fees from your security deposit if you don't pay them, 
leaving you the option of suing to recover them in Small Claims Court. Who Gets 
Deposit on Red-Tagged Rental? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Because of the Northridge earthquake, a Pacoima house that I rented out was 
red tagged. I had four houses on two lots but only two were badly damaged. I 
let the tenants from the red-tagged houses relocate to one of undamaged houses 
that just had become vacant.  
</P>
<P>
 FEMA gave the tenants $2,300, the Red Cross furnished the place for free (I 
don't know why because the furniture wasn't badly damaged), they got $600 in 
food stamps from welfare and they got an 18-month Section 8 housing certificate 
from HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 They left the other house in a mess due to having four dogs, five cats and two 
birds as pets. There were large holes in the walls and the carpets reek with 
animal smells. Do I have to refund any security deposit money? I feel that they 
got their deposits back from all these government agencies. Why should I also 
have to refund their deposits? I couldn't afford earthquake insurance and have 
suffered a huge loss due to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A: You must refund the tenant's security deposit in spite of how you may feel, 
or how much money or services they got from any government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, you may keep deposit money to compensate you for unpaid rent, 
cleaning or to repair damages above and beyond "normal wear and tear." 
</P>
<P>
 Since rent stopped accruing on the 17th, and was probably prepaid on the 
first, you can't keep any deposit money for that. Since you will not be 
cleaning or repairing the red tagged house, you cannot keep any money for that 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do you owe these tenants a security deposit refund, it must be 
refunded within 21 days after they move or you could be liable for a $600 
penalty for "bad faith retention" of the money. 'Pet Discrimination' Is Not 
Illegal 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I moved into my Studio City apartment in 1986 and was verbally told no pets 
were allowed. There was a sign on the building saying "No Pets" and that's what 
the rental agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, my next door neighbor has a cat. Another tenant has built a cage 
the entire length of his patio and keeps rats for pets. Still another has 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the manager tells me I can't have pets. The other neighbors are white and 
moved in after me. I am of color and feel discriminated against. Do I have any 
recourse? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It is possible that the owner changed the pet policy because of the 
recession in order to attract new renters. He can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 While certain types of discrimination are illegal in the sale or rental of 
real property, such as discrimination because of color or race, pet 
discrimination is not illegal. You cannot conclude that the different treatment 
you cite proves illegal discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't persuade the manager to allow you to a have a pet, and you must 
have one, moving may be your only option.

 Mark and Mary Ann Epstein had long contemplated looking for greener pastures 
in Northern California. That is, until they discovered the community of North 
San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had to leave Southern California to find what we've found here," 
said Mary Ann Epstein, a part-time occupational therapist for Rancho Los Amigos 
Hospital in Downey. "It's solid. It's family." 
</P>
<P>
 The Epsteins, who have two children, 1 and 5, first looked for a home in areas 
farther east, like Covina, San Dimas and Glendora. But Mary Ann's brother, a 
real estate appraiser, steered them to North San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think we could afford the neighborhood because it looks so 
expensive," Mary Ann Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were surprised to learn that the neighborhood was within their budget. In 
July, 1993, they bought a 1,500-square-foot home on a quiet, tree-lined street 
for $255,000. Now Mark Epstein, a data communications analyst for Parsons 
Engineering in Pasadena, is close to his job, and their daughter, Sarah, is a 
half block away from the neighborhood school she attends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lived in Alhambra for five years and knew only two people," Mary Ann 
Epstein said. "But this is just like a real neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 North San Gabriel is the area of San Gabriel north of Las Tunas Boulevard. It 
is bordered to the north by San Marino, to the west by Alhambra and to the east 
by Temple City. It also includes a section in the northeast corner that is part 
of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people don't know about North San Gabriel," said Wade Norwood, a 
Coldwell Banker real estate agent who specializes in the area. "It is more 
heavily wooded and established than the rest of San Gabriel." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents differentiate North San Gabriel from the rest of the city 
because the "quality of homes and neighborhood" is reflected in the price. The 
average price for a three-bedroom home in the North San Gabriel area, based on 
data for the last six months, was $283,000, verses an average price of $200,000 
for the rest of San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently sold homes ranged in price from a low of $140,000 for a 
1,088-square-foot home to a 3,700-square-foot home in the San Marino School 
District that sold for $740,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the architecturally diverse homes built in the 1930s and '40s 
are in the 1,200 to 1,800 square foot range. The exception is the row of estate 
homes along Country Club Drive, adjacent to the San Gabriel Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy and Robert Kinkaid moved from San Marino to their two-story, 
colonial-style home on Country Club Drive about 12 years ago. Peggy thinks the 
area has a "Midwestern feel" because of the older homes, big trees and friendly 
residents. "We have wonderful neighbors and a back yard gate to (their) 
property," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kinkaids believe that their house is "a home we could live in for the rest 
of our lives," with their two children, Elizabeth and Kathryn, ages 6 and 7. 
Apparently, other residents feel the same way because, even though the Kinkaids 
have been in the house for 12 years, they are still "one of the newest 
neighbors on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred and Sylvia Valles moved into the northwest corner of North San Gabriel 
in November of 1993. After years of buying fixer-uppers and moving on, Alfred 
Valles admitted, "I don't mind if we never move again." 
</P>
<P>
 Valles, a partner in a window and door manufacturing business, and his wife, a 
teacher, feel this is a good area for their children, 1 and 4, to grow up. They 
like the fact that the local school has a good reputation and that the 
"neighborhood is family oriented and has a good mix of old and young people." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Lichtenberg-Stern, director of development and alumni relations for the 
school of business at Cal State Northridge, and her husband, Joel, a sales 
manager for a business forms manufacturing company, moved into their 1930s 
Spanish-style home in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie has high praise for the local schools, which their daughters Sascha, 10, 
and Marissa, 5, both attend. The school district is "well organized, cares 
about the interests of the students," she said. "And, because it's a small 
district, parents have complete access to the superintendent's office. It's 
easy to make your wishes and concerns known." 
</P>
<P>
 Said San Gabriel Supt. Gary Goodson: "We pride ourselves on our open-door 
policy. We're available, we listen to the issues and we try to follow up on the 
educational needs." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the three elementary schools in North San Gabriel have high 
state test scores that compare favorably with San Marino, South Pasadena and 
Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodson is enthusiastic about two major school district changes scheduled for 
September. The middle school will be restructured to include Grades 6 through 8 
instead of Grades 7 through 9. And Grades 10 through 12 will attend the newly 
created Gabrielino High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents of North San Gabriel have seen very little change in their 
neighborhoods over the years. Albert Hill Kuhn, who bought his vacant lot in 
1946 for under $1,000, fondly remembers "picnics over the back fence and dances 
in the streets" in his earlier days, but said that the neighborhood is still 
"friendly and quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time that Kuhn and his wife built their home, the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA) limited the size, depending upon the number of family 
members. Since Kuhn and his wife had only one son, they were limited to a home 
of 900 square feet. Since then, Kuhn has added another 300 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest change that Kuhn sees in the neighborhood is in the ethnic mix. 
When he and his family moved in, the law on the books was that residents had to 
be Caucasian. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby Las Tunas Boulevard reflects the changing ethnic diversity of the 
community. Thirteen ethnic groups are represented in shops and restaurants on a 
one-mile stretch of the commercial street. 
</P>
<P>
 North San Gabriel's growing Japanese population is especially reflected in the 
businesses on Las Tunas: a Yaohan Supermarket; Yama, a small market selling 
fish and sundries, and Kintaro, a Japanese lunch shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Goto, a second-generation Japanese who is a fish salesman, drives his 
truck from neighborhood to neighborhood serving a largely Japanese clientele in 
North San Gabriel. For 30 years, Goto has offered everything from fresh salmon 
and tuna to octopus and squid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taeko Sakata, a Japanese national, said that Goto sells "the freshest fish I 
have found." The Sakata family, like many other Japanese nationals living in 
the community on five-year work visas, opted to lease rather than buy their 
North San Gabriel home. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Izmarian, who has lived in her home since 1959, has seen another change in 
the community: she has watched the trend in stay-at-home mothers go full 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 When she and her husband first moved into the neighborhood, mothers typically 
stayed home with their young children. In the '70s, Izmarian observed that the 
neighborhood became very quiet when a growing number of mothers joined the work 
force. But since the late '80s, she has seen a return of the traditional 
full-time mom. "It's nice to see the activity with young children once again," 
Izmarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Diann McGarvey became a full-time mother three years ago, she and a 
friend decided to start a play group. They canvassed their neighborhood and 
soon found 25 other stay-at-home or part-time working mothers with young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has "made the neighborhood seem much smaller and friendlier," said 
McGarvey. "It's kind of like what I grew up with." At a Glance

YOUR MORTGAGE; RATE LOCKS CAN EXPIRE IF LENDERS DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With mortgage rates significantly higher than they were 45 to 60 days ago, 
loan applicants across the country need to be on guard against a strategy that 
mortgage industry experts themselves concede is sometimes used against 
consumers: 
</P>
<P>
 Deliberate delays that push settlement dates beyond the expiration of rate 
locks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than delivering on a 7 1/4% 30-day rate lock in an 8 1/2% market, the 
mortgage company finds reasons to slow down the processing -- discovering 
sudden problems with the property appraisal, income or credit data. The net 
effect: Settlement is pushed back beyond the 30-day lock period. The lender is 
under no obligation to deliver the money-losing 7 1/4% loan the consumer 
applied for, but may offer a replacement deal at current market rates or 
slightly below. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few mortgage executives are willing to discuss it on the record, 
others readily confirm what one representative of a large, nationally active 
lender said: When rate jumps mean thousands of dollars of red ink if a loan 
goes to closing, "there can be tremendous pressure to look extra hard at 
problems with the (borrower's) application that you otherwise might have 
ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 One industry veteran, mortgage consultant and broker Allen Hardester of 
Columbia, Md., said that although the vast majority of mortgage bankers and 
other lenders honor their commitments -- rising rates or not -- "it's an open 
secret that plenty (of firms) do not." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardester cited for example a recent $130,000 application he submitted to a 
large Baltimore bank on behalf of a customer. The application was made in 
February -- before rates shot up by over a percentage point -- and should have 
been closed in late March. The bank had the applicant's full income and asset 
data for weeks and was moving ahead. But only when rates jumped -- and the 
rate-lock deadline loomed -- did the bank raise what Hardester calls 
"ridiculous, absolutely transparent questions" about the borrower's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hardester protested, he says the bank told him, "tough -- if you don't 
like it, sue us." The applicant didn't want the time hassles or costs of a 
lawsuit and walked away -- despite a written rate lock that cost the borrower 
$650. The bank ultimately refunded that fee, minus appraisal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardester listed what he called the three most common escape strategies for 
lenders or investors who don't want to deliver a loan on the rate-locked terms: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Challenge the appraisal. "Anybody can demand a review appraisal (a second, 
follow-up evaluation of the property and the assumptions used in the first)," 
said Hardester. "It's fully within their rights (before funding a loan), and an 
appraisal is easy to find fault with if you need to." 
</P>
<P>
 The comparable properties used as benchmarks for the applicant's home, for 
example, can be challenged as the wrong choices. Follow-up appraisals can add 
days to processing time, and may well come back with valuations below the 
original. That, in turn, can force the applicant to settle for a lower loan 
amount and bigger down payment, or to back out of the whole deal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Herk and jerk them to death" on documentation. Mortgage application 
packages submitted for funding frequently contain relatively minor, technical 
problems -- omissions of employment verification letters, incomplete bank 
statements, lack of one co-borrower's signature on a form, etc. When rates are 
headed down and application volume is up, according to Hardester, lenders 
routinely overlook these glitches. 
</P>
<P>
 But when rates are rising and the lender stands to lose money on the loan in 
the secondary market, even the smallest discrepancies and omissions are ripe 
for challenge. For example, he says he's seen loan packages knocked off track 
because a single, small late payment to a department store in the credit file 
wasn't documented as having been cleared up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Challenge income and debt data -- particularly for self-employed borrowers 
or applicants with complex financial situations. Hardester says flatly: "If you 
are self-employed (and the lender doesn't want to deliver at the locked rate), 
you're history." 
</P>
<P>
 Even under the best of circumstances, underwriters pepper self-employed 
borrowers with extensive requests for federal and state tax returns, corporate 
documents, accountants' statements and the like. But when the rate-lock clock 
is ticking and rates are moving up, the requests can go off the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardester emphasized that borrowers whose applications are subjected to heavy 
documentation requests or challenges this spring shouldn't automatically assume 
that their lenders are trying to wriggle out of a rate commitment. After all, 
he says, many applications contain legitimate, serious grounds for review or 
challenge that are in no way the fault of the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 But to be safe in a volatile market, Hardester recommends borrowers with 
locked rates follow these rules: First, stay in regular, close contact with the 
individual in charge of processing your loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to be in touch at every stage," he says. Has the appraisal been 
scheduled? Completed? Does it support the loan amount? Have all the income, 
employment and credit data come in? Are there any questions? 
</P>
<P>
 Second, create a paper trail if you're worried about your lock expiring. Send 
immediate follow-up letters after your conversations with loan officers. 
"Create a paper trail a mile long," Hardester advises. "That way you can always 
document that (the lender) was telling you, hey, no problems, you're ready to 
go."

GREEN THUMB; SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T IMPROVE ON NATURE; TOMATOES: DESPITE 
GARDENER'S ATTEMPTS TO STAKE OR CLIMB THEM, THESE PLANTS DO JUST FINE IF LEFT 
TO SPRAWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOT MICHENER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Michener is a Sierra Madre gardener. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The six-pack of tomato plants we buy at the nursery is quite a bargain -- the 
plants are young, eager and educated. 
</P>
<P>
 They already know more about hydraulic engineering than we could assimilate in 
a year at Caltech, and are equally well-grounded in the biologic sciences, the 
techniques of mass production and the processes they must follow in order to 
win neighborhood acclaim. All of this information is inherent in the DNA passed 
down from their progenitors. 
</P>
<P>
 From this, it appears that they may understand the business of producing 
tomatoes somewhat better than we do, and should be allowed to do it their way, 
which is both efficient and orderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Given garden space, the roots test the soil for texture, nutrients and 
moisture content; the leaves, for ambient temperatures and available sunlight. 
The plant then plans its production lines in accord with these findings. It 
knows how many blossoms to make, what sizes of branch and lengths of stem will 
be needed to nourish the fruit, and, importantly, what area of leaf surface 
will be required to power its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Its objectives in all of this are not directed toward a salad bowl or a 
ketchup bottle, but the survival of its species. It plans to spread its 
branches as far as possible and deposit its fruits where the seeds will sprout 
in the coming spring. It cannot know that it may be staked and tied, or 
confined in a wire cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has it any intention of climbing, for it has no tendrils. It plans, 
instead, to rise two or three feet, bush out and let its branches sprawl. 
Sprawl, for very good reasons: One, it is able to collect the most in sunlight 
this way, with few of its leaves shading others. Two, as the weight of the 
developing fruits bow the branches down, gravity takes over, as in a siphon, 
and keeps the nutrient juices flowing to where it is needed with little or no 
effort on the plant's part. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how many gallons of liquids are transported this way, month after month, 
and how much energy saved, only the plant knows. But its cleverness in getting 
so much work done for free suggested an experiment to me: What if the tomatoes 
were planted in a raised bed and the branches draped over a low railing? Would 
that not help the plant juices flow to the tomatoes? 
</P>
<P>
 The bed, three feet deep and six yards long, was given a bottom layer of 
rotted compost, six to eight inches deep, to retain moisture. It was then 
filled with prime topsoil mixed with commercial humus that did not contain any 
manure. Such manure is usually obtained from feeding lots where the piles are 
sprayed for fly control and retain toxics which inhibit plant growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The tomato plants (three Better Boys and two Beefsteaks) were given liberal 
portions of Osmocote, a timed-release fertilizer that lasts for eight months. 
Expensive, but good. The plants responded nobly. In 10 days they blossomed, in 
three weeks they were bushing out and setting fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment, it should be noted, was not made by the scientific method; the 
only "control" plants were the spare ones from our six-packs, given to 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 They were no doubt given the proper underground incentives but have not fared 
so happily above. Some were staked, some caged. In passing, one saw that they 
bore scarcely half as many tomatoes as their more fortunate siblings, and 
heard, in imagination at least, the groans of plant machinery that had to pump 
nutrients uphill.

GARDENING; ROUNDING OUT THE VEGETABLE PLOT, PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's some more good eating from our garden plot: 
</P>
<P>
 Beans, snap or lima. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant in full sun or partial shade, March-August for snap, May-June for 
lima. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sow seed in ground, thinning to 8" apart in rows 30" apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harvest snap in 60 days, lima in 75 days. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want the maximum amount in the minimum space, grow pole-type beans on 
8' poles or a trellis. The popular bush types are for people with a lot of 
room. Lima beans are picky about planting times, snap beans more versatile, but 
you actually have time for both. Plant a quarter of the 15-foot row to snap 
beans in early March, another quarter in April, another quarter to limas in 
early May and the last quarter to limas in early June. As these wear out, 
replace with fresh plantings of snap beans. Limas don't like hot weather. Both 
are susceptible to smog (causes blotchy leaves) and the later planting dates 
run into the season in inland areas. Pick frequently to keep beans coming, just 
before pods begin to bulge.  
</P>
<P>
 Eggplant 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant in full sun, April-May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant transplants 18" apart in rows 3' apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ready in 60 or so days. 
</P>
<P>
 Two go in this row, along with peppers. Each full-sized plant will yield about 
five or six fruit if they are thinned to one on each main branch. Smaller 
fruited "oriental" varieties produce more fruit that doesn't need thinning. 
They like a rich soil. Look for the beautiful new Purple Blush hybrid, a 
delicious lavender color. Pick when glossy and firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Peppers 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant in full sun, April-May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant transplants 24" apart in rows 3' apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Start harvesting in 70 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plants fit in our row and there are hundreds of kinds to choose from, so 
try several. Culture is the same for all kinds and very similar to that of 
tomatoes or eggplant (they're all cousins). Cook, use fresh or cut with an inch 
of stem attached and hang out in the sun to dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer squash 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant in full sun or partial shade, April-June. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thin seeds to 24" apart, in rows 4' apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ready in 50-60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Six squash are squished into this row, plus two cucumbers and a bush-type 
pumpkin. For most people, one zucchini is enough, so grow several kinds, such 
as yellow crookneck or straightneck, scallop types, or try one of the entirely 
new types such as kuta or Sun Drops with its tiny 3" fruit. Most kinds sold are 
bush varieties. Pick fruits when young for best taste, when they are six or 
less inches long. Plants keep producing for several weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Cucumbers 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant in full sun or part shade, April-June. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thin seeds to 2' apart in rows 4' apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Start harvesting after 50-70 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plants fit in this row and you'll want to grow slicing cucumbers for 
summer salads, but, if there's room or you want to grow less squash in the row, 
try a pickling kind to make pickles in a crock under the kitchen sink. Harvest 
lasts several weeks. Pick when slicers are 6-8" long. Cucumbers planted late in 
inland areas will probably need a little shade so some experts grow them beside 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaf lettuce 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant in full sun or partial shade, year round. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sow seed in ground, thinning to 6" apart, in rows 2' apart; in beds, 8" 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat thinnings, start cutting in 30 days, finished in 50-70 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget head lettuce in summer (except right along coast). Leaf lettuces, 
tastier and better for you, also prefer fall, winter and spring, but with a 
little luck, or a little shade, you can have plenty to go with the tomatoes. 
Plant several feet of row at a time to spread out the harvest. Inland, try 
between rows of corn or between tomatoes and beans, where they are shaded from 
the hot summer sun. Harvest as it grows, beginning with thinnings and then the 
outer leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrots 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant in full sun, year round. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thin seedlings to 2" apart in rows 24" apart; in beds, 3" apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ready in 60-70 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant short sections of row every few weeks for a nearly continuous supply, 
though seed gets a little hard to germinate in late summer (try shading the 
seeds or cover with newspaper). Seeds need cool, constantly moist soil to 
sprout. Gourmets say the young carrots are the best but you won't get much bang 
for your buck, so let some grow large and slice them up. Don't leave them in 
the ground too long or they become tough and crack. In heavy or rocky soils, 
try the shorter kinds to avoid deformed roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Beets 
</P>
<P>
 * Full sun or part shade, year round (January-September inland). 
</P>
<P>
 * Thin seedlings to 2" apart in rows 18-24 inches apart; in beds, 4" apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ready in 60 days or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Another crop to plant every few weeks for nearly continuous harvest, though 
curly top virus can be a problem on mid-summer crops. If so, plant in spring 
and again in fall. Beets are best when about 2" around, but can be left in the 
ground a long time, becoming only a little more bitter and tough.  
</P>
<P>
 Chard 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant full sun or part shade, February-May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thin seedlings to 12" apart in rows 2' apart; in beds, 8" apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ready in 50-60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Like beets this is a year-round crop near coast, but susceptible to curly top 
inland in summer. Ruby chard helps add a little color to the garden. Pick outer 
leaves first or they become tough and stringy. Food and Water 
</P>
<P>
 Summer vegetables need lots of water, especially tomatoes and lettuce. As long 
as the soil is well-aerated, fluffed with organic matter and not compacted, it 
is difficult to over-water vegetables. Don't drown them, but don't let any 
vegetable dry out. Fruit and blossom drop, or a bitter taste, often result. 
</P>
<P>
 It's usually enough if you add fertilizer when preparing the soil. Some may 
need more, especially in sandy soils, and especially crops being grown for 
their greens. Others, including tomatoes, actually produce less fruit if given 
too much fertilizer.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * If you have a warm, sunny corner in your garden that's bare, consider 
planting a gardenia shrub or two. Their lovely, fragrant white flowers add 
their scent to the garden and indoors when cut to fill vases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mulching in flower beds around shrubs and annuals and in the vegetable 
garden will help conserve soil moisture and reduce the weeds.

HOMEWISE: HOW MUCH GAS WATER HEATER SAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My electric water heater is leaking and needs to be replaced. I heat 
my home with natural gas so I'm considering replacing my electric water heater 
with a natural gas unit. I've been told I could cut my water heating costs by 
60% if I convert to gas. Can you give me an idea of how much I'm spending on 
electric water heating and if it's realistic to expect 60% savings by switching 
to natural gas? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Heating water with natural gas is usually less expensive than heating 
it with electricity. How much less depends on how much hot water you use. The 
efficiency of your water heater, and the price of natural gas and electricity 
in your area. While a 60% cost savings is certainly possible, conversion 
savings in the 30% to 50% range are more likely due to relatively low electric 
rates in our area. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical household will use 400 to 600 kilowatt hours each month heating 
water with electricity and 20 to 25 therms a month heating water with natural 
gas. At 4 cents per kilowatt hour and 50 cents per therm, that translates to 
water heating costs of $16 to $24 a month for electricity and $10 to $13 a 
month for natural gas. That gives you a range of potential dollar savings 
between $70 and $150 per year. If your electricity rates are above 6 cents per 
kilowatt hour, the savings may be more and your chances of reaching that 60% 
figure are more likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Another replacement option if gas in not available or if piping or exhaust 
flue placement is a problem, is to purchase a more efficient electric water 
heater.  
</P>
<P>
 No matter which fuel you use for water heating, it's important to use your hot 
water wisely. Conservation measures such as insulting pipes and older water 
heaters, keeping temperature settings no higher than 120 degrees, installing 
more efficient showerheads, and fixing those leaky faucets can also reduce your 
water heating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact your local gas and electric utilities for more information on hot 
water conservation programs and incentives they may be offering.

HANDYMAN Q & A: IF REFRIGERATOR FREEZES FOOD, CHECK FOR LEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I have an old Frigidaire combination refrigerator-freezer with the 
freezer on top and the thermostat in the evaporator. With the thermostat set at 
"A," the freezer is cold enough but the refrigerator is at about 28 degrees 
Fahrenheit and the food freezes. With the thermostat at "C" the freezer is 
about 20 degrees and the refrigerator at about 34 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 When a serviceman looked at the refrigerator he said there were drops of oil 
in the compressor terminals. This indicated a refrigerant leak, which he said 
would cost $300 to fix. I realize that this appliance has reached a ripe old 
age. However, it's still capable of freezing food and is only used 
intermittently for extra cold storage space at holiday time. 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: A drop of oil on the compressor terminals might or might not indicate 
a refrigerant leak. A good way to see if you have a leak is to look at your 
freezer coil. Begin by defrosting the refrigerator thoroughly. Turn the 
thermostat back on and let the refrigerator run for a while, then open the 
door. Check the frost pattern on the freezer coil. There should be frost all 
over the coil. This would indicate there is no refrigerant leak. 
</P>
<P>
 If only a small portion of the coil is frosted, this could indicate a slight 
shortage of refrigerant in the system. You can have a serviceman add 
refrigerant to the system. This would not be too expensive and it would keep 
your refrigerator going, especially if it is not in day-to-day service. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do have a good frost pattern on the coil in the freezer, we would 
suspect a defective thermostat if everything is getting too cold in the 
refrigerator section when the freezer is operating at the correct temperature. 
Replacing it is a straightforward job. Just make sure you get the correct part 
for your model. Can Copper Water Pipe Be Fixed With Plastic? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm replacing some bad sections of copper water pipe. Can I use PVC pipe 
for the repairs? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Plastic water pipe can be jointed to steel and copper pipe by means of 
plastic threaded adapters. Both male and female plastic adapters are available. 
One end of the plastic adapter is glued to the plastic pipe and the other 
threaded into a fitting or onto a pipe. When joining plastic water pipe to 
existing metal piping, wrap the male threads with plastic pipe joint sealant 
tape. Because plastic female adapters can expand when threaded onto male 
threads, a better choice is to use a plastic male adapter threaded into an iron 
or copper female adapter or fitting. Vent Pipe Needed to Dissipate Sewer Gas 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you explain the working and purpose of a vent pipe? Some months ago, 
during a heavy rain, water came pouring into a third-floor room. Our roofer 
came and said it was not a roof defect, that there might be a break or blockage 
inside the vent pipe. He filled a plastic beverage bottle with water and 
inserted it in the top of the vent. We have had no flooding since. However, at 
times I sense an unfamiliar odor through the house. My daughter thinks there 
may be some harmful gases seeping through the house. 
</P>
<P>
 A: The odor you smell is probably from sewer gas, which is the result of the 
vent stack being blocked. The vent pipe must never be obstructed. Its purpose 
is to vent sewer gas to the atmosphere and to maintain atmospheric pressure 
within the drainage system. 
</P>
<P>
 Each plumbing fixture, such as a sink, has a bend known as a P trap, as part 
of its drainage piping. A little water is left in the trap every time water 
drains from the fixture. The trapped water forms a seal to block sewer gas 
(which is normally present in the drain line) from entering the house. 
</P>
<P>
 When it rains, water enters the opening at the top of the vent stack. Normally 
this is not a problem. However, if the vent pipe is offset in the attic, and if 
this offset section is cracked or has a hole, water will drip onto the floor 
and wet the ceiling below. 
</P>
<P>
 If the vent stack is blocked, the sewer gas will rise to the point of the 
obstruction and then back out to a point where it can escape, such as a crack 
or hole. It can build up enough pressure to force its way past the water in the 
trap. In your case, the sewer gas is probably seeping out a crack in the vent 
stack, and from there the gas makes its way into the attic and seeps into the 
rest of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 We suggest you look in the attic for the source of the leak. Don't forget to 
remove the plastic beverage bottle from the vent stack.

ON THE HOUSE: CAULKING EASIER WHEN YOU PICK RIGHT TYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES CARREY and MORRIS CAREY, FOR AP NEWSFEATURES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caulking is a year-round job. In the spring, you caulk the exterior to get it 
ready for painting. In the summer, you re-caulk tubs and showers that mildewed 
during the winter and spring. In the fall, you find yourself caulking windows 
and doors and other potential sources of winter air and water leaks. Finally, 
during the winter when the ceiling begins to drip, you stock up on caulking for 
the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three basic types of caulking -- silicone caulk, butyl caulk and 
latex caulk. Silicone Caulk The most expensive of the basic three is silicone 
caulking. It is best for sealing metal, glass, tile and other smooth, 
non-porous surfaces. Of the three, it is the most flexible and shrinks the 
least. Silicone is especially well-suited for sealing dissimilar materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Be careful. Silicone is not meant to be used on masonry or stone and doesn't 
do well on redwood or cedar. Most silicone caulks can not be painted, and 
because acetic acid is the solvent that keeps them damp, silicone caulks have a 
sharp, irritating smell. Butyl-Rubber Caulk This group of caulks works best on 
concrete, concrete block, brick, stone, gutters, flashings and chimneys. What 
makes butyl caulk special is its ability to be used in extremely wet areas. 
This makes it great for jobs underground and on the roof. Butyl caulk also 
works well on aluminum siding. 
</P>
<P>
 Although butyl caulk can be painted, it comes in many colors. Unfortunately, 
it is difficult to work with. It is stringy when applied, requires paint 
thinner at cleanup time, shrinks a lot and is slow drying. Latex Caulk The most 
popular of the three is latex -- or acrylic -- caulking. Latex is water soluble 
and that makes it easy to use and easy to clean up after. 
</P>
<P>
 It is best used on highly porous surfaces such as wood. Since latex caulk is 
used on both inside and outside surfaces, it is available in an interior and an 
exterior grade. The exterior grade is a bit more dense and therefore slightly 
more expensive. Exterior grade latex can be used inside, but interior grade is 
not for outdoor use. Tips for Use When caulking, remember that the width of the 
bead will be about 30% wider than the diameter of the hole that you cut in the 
end of the caulking tube. Start with a small hole. Run a test bead on a scrap 
of wood. Enlarge the hole at the end of the tube with a razor knife, a little 
at a time, until you get the desired bead width. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important that caulking touch on three sides -- the bottom and two sides 
-- of the groove being caulked. Each surface helps to hold the caulking in 
place. If a groove is deeper than a quarter of an inch, we recommend that you 
use a foam backer rod, string, cloth, paper or some other flexible filler as a 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 Caulking requires a very important tool -- your finger. And lots of paper 
towels or a damp sponge. Vent, Fan May Solve Dripping Problem 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am a building contractor and I am perplexed. A customer of mine has 
observed a strange phenomenon -- small droplets of water have appeared along 
the underside of a ridge-beam above the family room. The moisture seems to be 
emanating from the rafter-bays immediately above this area. The rafter space is 
not well-ventilated and thus holds a great deal of heat. By mid-afternoon water 
drops can be seen beginning their descent. So, apparently the heat is the 
mechanism by which the water is produced. Do you have any ideas? What is 
causing this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You have described the cause and effect beautifully. All you missed was the 
solution -- and that's easy. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we must assume that the problem you have described is condensation and 
not a roof leak. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, condensation is controlled by increasing the rate of flow of air in 
the area where the water droplets materialize. Since the rafters are not 
well-ventilated, this is the area that should be attacked. General Aniline Film 
Corp. (GAF) makes a product called Cobra Ridge Vent. The ridge shingles are 
removed, a slot is cut in the roof sheathing below, the ridge venting material 
is rolled out and stapled in place and the ridge shingles are returned to their 
original location, but over the new venting material. 
</P>
<P>
 A decorative light fan should be added to the ceiling of the room where the 
problem exists as an added precaution against a recurrence of the dripping 
condition. Caulking Tips 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut the nozzle of the caulk tube at 45 degree angle 
</P>
<P>
 * Hold the gun at about a 45 degree angle, the same angle as the cut on the 
nozzle of the cartridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * An electrical wire nut will prevent partially used tubes of caulk from 
drying out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caulk hard to reach places with an extension tube made from plastic tubing.

THAT CRUSTY BATHROOM SCUM IS ACTUALLY A BUILDUP OF LIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That crusty scum around your faucets seems impenetrable. You've tried 
scrubbing, but it just won't come off. What is it? How can you remove it? 
</P>
<P>
 These household nuisances are buildups of lime, actually calcium oxide, which 
occurs in the earth's surface and is carried to your sink and tub through the 
water supply. It builds up on itself, forming a crust, when water puddles and 
dries around faucets and drain lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Lime can be removed by applying an acid-based cleaning product. The acid is 
phosphoric, in most cases, but may be even stronger in some products, such as 
hydroxyacetic acid found in the product Lime-A-Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever cleaner you use, apply the product, let it sit, loosen the lime with 
a stiff brush or abrasive pad. Be careful not to scratch your faucet or 
porcelain -- only rub the caked on lime. Reapply as necessary, rinsing well 
between applications. For extremely heavy buildup, scraping or chipping with a 
blunt tool such as a butter knife may be necessary after the buildup is 
somewhat loosened. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not use these acid-based products in combination with ammonia or bleach or 
their derivative products, as toxic fumes will result. Read and follow label 
directions.

REMODELER'S DIARY: HOW TO SAVE YOUR SANITY DURING REMO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON WHITLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Sharon Whitley is a San Diego 
free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am one of an estimated 41 million Americans -- more than one-third of the 
adult work force -- who has chosen to work at home. That's the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 And I am also one who recently did extensive remodeling to my 37-year-old 
home, adding 1,300 square feet -- dining room/family room, upstairs master 
bedroom and bath and roof deck. We also made over the ancient-applianced 
kitchen and existing two baths, installed all new custom-made doors and 
windows, modernized the front exterior, all while working at home. That's the 
insane news. 
</P>
<P>
 During this two-year process, I have learned -- with 20/20 hindsight -- what 
should have been done during the remodeling project (stressful and disruptive 
for anyone who undertakes it, especially for those of us who conduct business 
from our homes). And I'm happy to pass this on to you: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Install a second phone line for the work crew. You'd be surprised how often 
they need to call stores to order supplies and schedule deliveries, beep the 
contractor when questions come up and even (!) make personal calls to their 
homes (if they'll be late coming home, for example). If you use your phone as a 
handy business tool during the day (as I do), you'll go nuts (as I did) with 
the work crew competing with you for that precious receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tell the crew about your business and your time schedule. You'll have 
carpenters, cleaning crew, scaffolders, drywallers, stucco men, electricians, 
plumbers, etc. working on your project. Take a few minutes to tell them your 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many times when I was talking to an editor or interviewing someone on the 
phone in my office, I would hear "Sharon! Sharon! Come check the tile!" or 
"Hello! Hello! Anybody home? Your plumber has arrived!" Keep a sign posted on 
your office door that can be changed: "Please don't disturb unless house is 
burning down; I'll be available at -- -- o' clock; Welcome, please come in." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tell the crew not to answer your telephone if you're not at home, that your 
phone machine will pick it up. Once I was meeting a semi-celebrity for lunch 
when a New York editor called. The electrician answered: "Oh! Sharon's not here 
now, she's out with some bigwig!" Fortunately, the editor had a sense of humor 
and we chuckled about it later. The electrician meant well, but I cringed. 
Another "insanity" check-off on my list! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Find out when/if the electricity will be shut off. Once I was working on an 
important article on my computer and was halfway through when the power went 
out. I lost the piece and had to start all over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check also to see when old toilets will be removed (for the new low-flush 
models to be installed). This may not sound important, but I came home from 
jury duty one day to use the bathroom facilities. Oops! Both toilets were out 
of the bathrooms, displayed prominently on my patio. No neighbors were home. I 
finally had to call my former piano teacher and use her bathroom, two blocks 
away! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be respectful of neighbors. Before we started the project, I sent next-door 
neighbors restaurant certificates to use "when the pounding got to them" to go 
have lunch on me. I also tried to have the crew not make much noise until after 
9 a.m.-11 a.m. on Sundays, if they needed to occasionally work then -- and to 
stop noise by 7 p.m. This didn't always happen to coincide with the crew's 
schedules, but I tried to reduce the noise disturbance as much as possible. If 
there was hammering inside, for instance, I kept all doors and windows shut. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When my sanity reached the breaking point (which happened on several 
occasions), I scheduled a two- or three-day "getaway." Just going to Hotel Del 
Coronado or to Baja with friends reduced the remodel overload. It's especially 
good to get away when all your kitchen appliances are torn out and you can't 
cook or wash dishes anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maintain your privacy as much as possible. Try to have a room with a bed 
(and a door you can lock) to escape to, when needed. And, if possible, have one 
bathroom designated for the work crew. I had a room air-conditioner installed 
in my office, where I escaped on extra-hot days, even napping on the floor! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hide a key for the trusted work crew. There will be times when they'll come 
to work and you won't be home. This happened to us once when I had an early 
breakfast meeting and forgot to leave a key for the crew to get their equipment 
out of the garage, delaying work for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Compliment the crew when it's warranted. Whether they're laying tile or 
doing drywall, the construction workers, like anyone, like to be commended on 
their work, which they take pride in. Offer them ice water during hot weather 
-- and cold drinks and watermelon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When the remodel is complete, have an open house and invite your neighbors 
and the work crew (so they can pass out business cards) -- and your friends, of 
course. Display "before" pictures so people can see what you did -- and where 
your money went!

 An article April 3 on art appreciation in the digital age confused the market 
availability of some products developed at the Art Institute of Chicago.An 
interactive computer game inviting children to go on a pre-Columbian treasure 
hunt or deconstruct a Louise Nevelson sculpture is for use at the museum only 
and has not been marketed. A children's laser disc, "With Open Eyes," is sold 
by Voyager. An interactive program on ancient art is being developed in-house 
at the museum and is expected to be completed in late 1995.

VALLEY BRIEFING: WOODLAND HILLS; TREE-LINED RESIDENTIAL STREETS MIX WITH 
CORPORATE HIGH-RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The community of Woodland Hills has grown from a bucolic enclave of hillside 
cottages and flatland farms to one of the region's thriving business centers. 
Once home to high-profile refugees from Hollywood's bustle, such as Bob Hope, 
Mae West and Frank Sinatra, Woodland Hills has become almost a mini-city unto 
itself. Its tree-lined streets still attract residents such as Police Chief 
Willie Williams. History 
</P>
<P>
 * Early days: Much of what is now Woodland Hills was amassed during the second 
half of the 1800s by Miguel Leonis, a Basque who married the daughter of an 
Indian landowner and who ruled the land with an iron fist until his death in 
1889. In the early 1920s, real estate developer Victor Girard subdivided 2,800 
acres of hillside into nearly 7,000 lots, built a country club, planted 
thousands of eucalyptus, sycamore, fir pine and pepper trees and named the 
community after himself. The remote settlement of Girard dwindled to a 
population of 75 families during the Depression year of 1931, but rebounded 
later in the decade. In 1941, a chamber of commerce was formed and residents 
adopted the name of Woodland Hills. By 1950, the community had about 4,500 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Warner Center: During the 1930s and 1940s, motion picture mogul Harry Warner 
bought up about 1,200 acres of what is now Warner Center, where he built a home 
on a knoll, raised thoroughbred racehorses and planned to developed the land. 
By the time Warner died in 1958, a shopping center and several subdivisions had 
been built. Since then, the area has become a major commercial, industrial and 
residential area, with two shopping malls and the high-rise towers of such 
well-known companies as Blue Cross, Litton Industries, Rocketdyne, Kaiser 
Permanente and 20th Century Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Landmarks: The Motion Picure and Television Fund on Mulholland Drive north 
of Old Topanga Canyon Road, is home to many entertainment industry retirees. 
Los Angeles Pierce College, at Winnetka Avenue and Victory Boulevard, started 
in 1947 as an agriculture school but has become a full academic community 
college. Leonis Adobe and Plummer House, on Calabasas Road west of Mulholland 
Drive, is kept meticulously as an historically accurate museum. Pacific Lodge 
Boys Home, on Serrania Avenue south of Ventura Boulevard, has housed and 
nurtured wayward boys for 60 years. Community Issues 
</P>
<P>
 * Development: Rapid growth in the West San Fernando Valley during the past 
few decades prompted Woodland Hills residents to arm themselves with a 
knowledge of city laws and state environmental rules in an attempt to influence 
the shape of development. The most famous battle was over a proposed office 
tower and condominium project on Warner Ridge, between Warner Center and Pierce 
College. Endorsed by then-City Councilwoman Joy Picus in the mid-1980s, the 
planned development raised the ire of the Woodland Hills Homeowners 
Organization, which filed a series of lawsuits in an attempt to block it. Picus 
became a vehement critic of Warner Ridge, but was voted out of office in 1993 
anyway. Plans for the project collapsed three months ago due to financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Neighborhood concerns: Homeowner skirmishes are waged on a smaller scale, 
too. Residents of the mostly white, affluent community have beaten back plans 
for an adult school and day care center at the closed Charles Evans Hughes 
Junior High School and complained to their elected officials about day laborers 
looking for work on several street corners. Crime fears have spawned a network 
of highly organized neighborhood watch groups. Residents of Woodland Hills and 
neighboring West Hills have also been some of the most vocal opponents of the 
city's ban on trapping coyotes. Community Profile

SNAKEBITE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Research by STEPHANIE STASSEL and JEFF MCDONALD / Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rattlers, California's only venomous snakes, begin a brief hibernation in late 
November and are out as early as February. Up to 6 feet long, they are found 
mostly in deserts and foothills. Rattlesnakes favor cool, shady spots during 
the days, but at night seek rocks, concrete or asphalt that is still warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Already this season, dozens of rattlesnakes have been reported to Ventura 
County agencies from the less-populated areas of Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, 
Moorpark and Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Snakes do not bite people out of an aggressive desire to kill, but because 
they react to what their instincts interpret as an attack. Probably 90% of all 
snake bites can be prevented by following one simple rule: Always watch where 
you put your hands and feet. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 45,000 poisonous snake bites occur each year in the United States, 
most of these from rattlesnakes. While only 15 to 20 of these are fatal (more 
people die annually of bee stings, being struck by lightning or being struck by 
golf balls), the rest suffer painful, often dangerous and debilitating 
recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one rattlesnake bite has been reported so far this season. Earlier this 
month, a mountain biker who stopped for a rest in the foothills by the Rincon 
area north of Ventura was bitten when he sat in some tall grass and disturbed a 
rattlesnake. He was treated for his wound at an area hospital, and was expected 
to recover fully. Six Local Species 
</P>
<P>
 Western Diamondback: From three to seven feet long, it favors dry prairies, 
brushy deserts and rocky foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Diamondback: Tan, pink or reddish relative of the Western diamondback. 
Likes rocky brushland on coastal and desert sides of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Mojave Green: Considered to be among the world's most poisonous rattlers, it 
is greenish and has well-defined, light-edged diamonds or hexagons down the 
middle of its back. 
</P>
<P>
 Speckled Rattlesnake: Has dark rings on its tail and faint designs ranging 
from hexagons to hourglasses to diamonds. Colors vary as well, including cream, 
yellow, pink and brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidewinder: A desert species found in areas with fine, windblown sand. Noted 
for moving by swinging its body in a distinctive S shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Rattlesnake: The Southern Pacific rattler, a subspecies of the Western 
rattlesnake, is the main rattler in this area. Western rattlesnakes are one to 
five feet in length and have dark blotches on their necks that become bands 
toward the tail. Habitat ranges from prairies to evergreen forests. The Poison 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California area has six species of rattlesnakes. Some rattlesnake 
venoms primarily attack the nervous system, while other affect the heart and 
circulatory system. If bitten, a person should be kept calm while help is 
summoned. Experts no longer advise making an incision across the bite and 
sucking out the venom, unless help is a few hours away.

 Glottis The Rattle 
</P>
<P>
 The rattle is the feature that distinguishes rattlesnakes from other snakes, 
which also vibrate their tails when alarmed. The loosely interlocked rattles 
are composed of keratin, the same substance that forms human hair and nails. 
When shakes, the rattles rub against each other, producing a hissing sound 
audible up to 100 feet away. Avoiding Rattlesnakes 
</P>
<P>
 Don't keep stacks of wood outside, The make great snake nests. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair leaky outdoor faucets (snakes occasionally drink from them). 
</P>
<P>
 Wear high boots and long pants in grassy areas and carry a stick to beat the 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep trash in containers with tight-fitting lids. 
</P>
<P>
 Install molding on door bottoms, particularly on garage doors, to seal off 
potential entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 Clear brush from around buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Teach children to identify rattlesnakes. The Victim 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Willis E. Wingert, a County-USC Medical Center physician specializing in 
rattlesnake bites, has developed statistics on injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of people bitten are men between the ages of 17 and 27. 
</P>
<P>
 85% of all bites are on the hand or arm; 10% occur on the foot or lower leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bites occur because of carelessness or ignorance, such as when a hiker 
steps on a sleeping rattler or a child plays with one. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than 30% of the cases, the victim is drunk. Calling for Help:
