GARY KILDALL; HIS SOFTWARE SYSTEM LOST TO RIVAL MS-DOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Kildall, who created the first popular operating system for personal 
computers only to lose out to Microsoft's now standard MS-DOS program, is dead 
at age 52. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy failed to determine the cause of Kildall's death on Monday at 
Community Hospital, the Monterey County coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, Kildall wrote his personal computer operating system, Control 
Program-Monitor, a fundamental program that controls how information is stored 
and retrieved from a floppy disk drive. 
</P>
<P>
 To sell it, Kildall and his then-wife, Dorothy McEwen, in 1974 formed a 
company that came to be known as Digital Research. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Kildall was approached by IBM to develop the operating system for its 
personal computers. He thought he had struck a deal, but IBM later met with 
William Gates, founder of the then-small software company Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM eventually offered personal computers with either the CP-M operating 
system from Digital Research or MS-DOS from Microsoft. But it priced 
Microsoft's version at $40 and Digital's at $240. 
</P>
<P>
 MS-DOS eventually became the industry standard and Gates is ranked as one of 
the richest men in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the industry alleged that MS-DOS infringed on CP-M patents, but 
Kildall didn't sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days everyone was imitating everyone else," Kildall explained 
several years ago. "That's why I didn't do anything about CP-M; it never 
occurred to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1981 interview, Kildall said: "Basically, I am a gadget-oriented person. 
I like to work with gadgets, dials and knobs. I'm not a very competitive 
person. I'm forced into it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Kildall founded the company Knowledge-Set to develop one of the first 
consumer applications for CD-ROM, a compact disc system that stores large 
amounts of information. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital Research was sold to Novell in 1991 in a stock-swap deal valued at $80 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Kildall, a Seattle native, received his Ph.D. in computer science from the 
University of Washington.

COURT REJECTS APPEAL OF RULES FOR LIQUOR STORES; REGULATION: OWNERS OF 
SOUTH-CENTRAL MARKETS DESTROYED IN THE 1992 RIOTS WERE CHALLENGING LOS ANGELES' 
CONDITIONS TO ALLOW REOPENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB EGELKO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court rejected a challenge Thursday by Korean American store 
owners to restrictions by the city of Los Angeles on reopening liquor stores 
that were burned in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners said conditions imposed by the city were so burdensome that only 
six of 175 Korean-owned stores licensed to sell alcoholic beverages have 
reopened. Their suit argued that the city was trying to regulate liquor sales, 
which are subject to exclusive state regulation under California law. 
</P>
<P>
 But a state appeals court ruled in Los Angeles' favor in March, saying the 
purpose of the city's restrictions was to curb undesirable activity near liquor 
stores and not to regulate or prohibit liquor sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court denied review of the owners' appeal Thursday. Only 
Justices Stanley Mosk and Armand Arabian voted for a hearing, two short of the 
needed majority on the seven-member court. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen L. Jones, lawyer for the Korean American Legal Advocacy Foundation, 
blamed hysteria and a neo-Prohibition movement for driving the store owners out 
of business. He said he was deeply disappointed by the Supreme Court's action. 
</P>
<P>
 After the violence that followed the first Rodney King trial in 1992, the City 
Council passed a resolution blaming an "inordinate" amount of liquor stores in 
South-Central Los Angeles for contributing to health and safety problems. The 
city required liquor stores that had been destroyed or badly damaged -- most of 
them Korean-owned -- to obtain new permits before reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 The permits contained numerous requirements for lighting, graffiti cleanup, 
trash removal and in some cases limits on hours of operation. Jones said the 
most burdensome was a requirement that each store have a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with little mom-and-pop minimarkets," the lawyer said. "To have 
a full-time, licensed security guard sit around and eat peanuts is 
prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
 A guard could do little about the off-site crime problems that were the city's 
professed concern, Jones added. "It's just a condition that effectively denies 
people the ability to go back into business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The store owners' request for an injunction against the permit requirements 
was denied by Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien in June, 1993, and their suit 
was dismissed two months later by Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin. The 2nd 
District Court of Appeal upheld Chirlin's ruling this March. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's exclusive authority to regulate liquor sales, established by a 
1934 state constitutional amendment, is not violated by the city's restrictions 
on liquor store operations, said Justice Earl Johnson in the 3-0 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the city, exercising its power to regulate land use, was trying to 
control the "negative conduct which tends to occur on premises immediately 
surrounding" liquor stores, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also rejected the store owners' argument that the city was violating a 
state law that allowed dealers of alcoholic beverages to maintain their 
businesses if the only reason for a temporary closure was an "act of God." 
</P>
<P>
 An "act of God" is a natural force, like an earthquake or lightning, and does 
not include fires caused by other people, Johnson said.

NOT TO MOVE ON THIS BILL WOULD BE A CRIME; GETTING HUNG UP ON THE 
RACIAL-DISPARITY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is the $30-billion crime bill about to be mugged? 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious and much-needed legislation promises more cops, more prisons and 
more drug treatment, among other things, in the war against crime. Given the 
broad public appeal, approval should be a slam dunk in Washington. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation remains stalled in a joint House-Senate conference committee. 
The major sticking point for the White House, conservative Democrats and most 
Republicans is the part known as the Racial Justice Act. The proposed act, 
which is in the House version but not in the Senate's, would allow defendants 
convicted of capital offenses to appeal their sentences by using statistics to 
argue that the death penalty is applied in a racially discriminatory fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrats insist on this protection because the crime bill would 
expand the death penalty (which this newspaper has long opposed) to 63 
additional offenses. A majority of the Congressional Black Caucus strongly 
champions the provision in the interest of fairness, mindful that the number of 
African Americans who are sentenced to die, particularly if their victims were 
white, is a disproportionate percentage of the death-sentenced prison 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally mindful of the stalemate caused by the proposal are Rep. Kweisi Mfume 
(D-Md.), the chairman of the Black Caucus; Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), the 
sponsor of the anti-bias safeguard, and other supporters, including the 
American Bar Assn., the American Jewish Congress, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund 
and the National Urban League. A proposed compromise would prohibit retroactive 
and repeat claims of racial bias to eliminate a new burden on the judiciary. It 
would require proof of discrimination to relate to the individual case and not 
depend solely on statistics. It would also expressly prohibit quotas for Death 
Row and a blanket invalidation of the death penalty in a specific jurisdiction. 
These changes are reasonable; but the changes don't please the White House or 
enough Republicans and conservative Democrats. A permanent deadlock would be 
unfortunate because the crime bill has plenty of good features.  
</P>
<P>
 Most attractive is the promise of 100,000 additional police officers financed 
by new community policing grants and a novel police corps, modeled after the 
ROTC. It would put more cops on the streets by rewarding a commitment to four 
years in law enforcement with scholarships. Despite the roaring demand and 
undeniable need for more officers by cash-strapped cities like Los Angeles, 
Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), an influential member of the conference committee, 
contemplates scaling down the police corps. That would be a tragic error. It is 
not for nothing that Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams and other top 
cops are begging for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill's assault weapons ban, pushed aggressively by California's Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, also would make the streets a little safer. It, too, should 
be retained. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington talks tough on crime every year. Yet so many worthy bills die. If 
the Administration sticks to its rejection of the sensible compromise on the 
racial justice matter, it at least must give liberal House Democrats something, 
in this bill or in future legislation, to compensate for the loss on an issue 
of deep principle. Regardless, the bill should be passed. Americans are weary 
of crime and want something done.

WHEN SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE; COUNCILWOMAN CHICK CALLS FOR OVERHAULING LAPD'S 
OUTDATED COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advanced electronic technology -- ranging from integrated computer networks to 
satellite and fiber-optic communications -- has raised workplace productivity 
and efficiency by dramatically reducing the time required for many tasks. 
Indeed, the products of modern science are now so common, and are relied on so 
heavily, that it's hard to imagine how offices of business and government ever 
got along without them. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many employees of the Los Angeles Police Department have yet to 
directly experience the benefits of the megabyte. That's because the LAPD, the 
second-busiest police department in the nation, is technologically deprived. 
</P>
<P>
 According to City Council member Laura Chick, substandard and outdated 
technology may be keeping 30% to 40% of available officers from the field every 
day. In fact, the department still lacks a computer network linking its 18 
geographic divisions. That's an absurdity in a city that is among the most 
underpoliced in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick has introduced a motion to convene experts from within and outside the 
LAPD to draft a modernization plan for communications. The aim is to enhance 
public safety by improving efficiency and helping to implement so-called 
community policing. The San Fernando Valley councilwoman hopes to present the 
proposal to the City Council's public safety committee within nine months so it 
can be included in the 1995-96 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The new emphasis on upgrading technology in the Police Department is long 
overdue. Of course, the required equipment will not come cheap. And before any 
public monies are set aside for this improvement, the council should explain 
why the city has been so slow to upgrade its 911 emergency telephone system. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, 77% of L.A. voters supported Proposition M, a $235-million bond 
measure to enhance and expand the city's overloaded and often unreliable 
emergency communications system. Now, despite several near-failures of the 
existing system, some officials maintain it could take seven more years to get 
the new emergency network up and running. We agree with city Controller Rick 
Tuttle's description of the process as "unacceptably long to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Bureaucratic torpor and inefficiency increasingly are testing the credibility 
of government in a complex society that demands quick responses. Public safety, 
more than any other responsibility of government, demands speed. A minute can 
be long, very long, when a life is in peril.

NEW HOSPITAL COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent column by George Ramos (July 4) implies that the University of 
Southern California may somehow benefit financially when a new hospital complex 
is built to replace the deteriorating buildings at the Los Angeles County-USC 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: The new hospital will be a community resource, owned and 
operated by Los Angeles County. USC will continue to provide the doctors, as it 
has for more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The current facility is substandard and must be closed. Failure to build a new 
medical center would leave large numbers of Eastside residents without care and 
cripple the county's trauma network.

JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an article on the California Commission on Judicial Performance 
(Commentary, June 29), UC Prof. Ruth Rosen inaccurately quoted me as saying 
that at national meetings personnel from other state commissions have mocked 
the California Commission. I am also quoted out of context criticizing certain 
private admonishments of judges as being too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never spoken to Rosen so she must have obtained the quotes from a San 
Francisco newspaper article that had misquoted me. Rosen at least might have 
noted that I repudiated those quotes in a lengthy letter published in that same 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 If she interviewed me, I would have told her that the California Commission 
and its excellent staff are highly regarded by their counterparts in other 
states. The basis of the inaccurate quote that I and my colleagues have 
"mocked" the California Commission was a "mock" cross examination at an annual 
training meeting several years before the present executive director was hired. 
I personally chose the California Commission for the "mock" session as a 
teaching tool because the commission was, and still is, one of the best and 
most highly regarded in the country. The lively, interesting format 
demonstrated to the conferees from 40 states that any one of us could be 
cross-examined on disciplinary cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco reporter misconstrued my story of the "mock" proceeding and 
Rosen used a stale, repudiated quote without checking with the primary source. 
</P>
<P>
 As to lenient private admonishments, any person, in hindsight and without 
knowing all of the facts at hand, could criticize some private discipline in 
every state in this country. At every national meeting of judicial conduct 
commission staff, we analyze and critique disciplinary decisions from numerous 
states. That, too, was misinterpreted by the San Francisco reporter and the 
misquote was then used by Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Every state needs to reform disciplinary procedures to some extent. But Rosen 
should base her arguments on the facts.

ESCOBAR MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Colombian, I regret the murder of Andres Escobar in Colombia (July 3). 
But it is not just the way he died that saddened my heart.It is that with his 
death, the hope for my country to be recognized for anything other than a 
country of murderers and drug dealers seems to be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to the comments of one of the players from the American soccer team 
was hard. It made me think about the things that are "wrong" with Colombia. It 
seems to be clear that we need a stronger government, able to apply gun control 
laws. We need to stop a drug problem that is destroying family values and we 
need to control violence in the media. There are too many Rambos on Colombian 
TV, most of which are American programs. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not expect this letter to change the American mentality about my 
beautiful country. I just hope people will read it and realize that our 
problems are the same as yours. Don't fool yourself in thinking "that will 
never happen here." Many famous Americans have been assassinated in the United 
States.

GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Timothy Smith (letter, July 7) responded to your June 23 editorial, "Nuts over 
Guns," by pointing out that cars are not blamed in drunk driving accidents, and 
long, serrated knives are not being blamed in the Simpson murder case. He 
therefore claims that guns should not be blamed for gun deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 This illogical deduction springs from standard NRA rhetoric. What their 
argument fails to acknowledge is that when cars and knives are used correctly, 
they don't kill people, but when a gun is used correctly, it does kill people. 
That is the express purpose of a gun. It therefore follows that if products 
designed and used for killing were better controlled and regulated, there would 
be less killing. Smith claims that "gun bans do not work, ask anyone in the 
nation's capital." He fails to point out that Washington is completely 
surrounded by places where guns can be obtained. Using Washington as an example 
of how gun bans don't work is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith concludes by claiming that "responsible citizens" want a future where 
guns won't be needed for defense because "the bad guys are gone." No one, not 
even the National Rifle Assn., can dispute the fact that it is impossible to 
control human behavior, and it is impossible to eliminate all "bad guys." 
Therefore, we must control the only thing we can control: the products designed 
to do the killing, i.e., the guns.

'CLINTON'S VISCERAL OPPOSITION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' teary-eyed article ("Clinton's Visceral Opposition," July 5) about 
big, bad Republicans and their alleged abuse of the President and Mrs. Clinton 
breaks my heart. For almost 50 years liberal Democrats in and out of the media 
have indulged in nonstop, unfounded, mindless vilification of the late Richard 
Nixon. Oh, poor, poor Bill and Hillary! Boo hoo hoo . . .

courageous, thoughtful steps to improve the lives of U.S. citizens need be 
taken before unproved allegations can be appropriately set on the back burner?

 Fortunately for us, the Clintons have grown in stature in the last two years, 
which reflects their integrity, their intelligence and their genuine compassion

 * A word of caution from a loyal, mainstream Democrat to all loyal, mainstream 
Republicans. Remember what happened to the Democrats in the '60s? The 
Democratic Party began pandering to a small group of left-wing extremists and 
today, the word "liberal" is used as a derogatory and insulting term in most of 
the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican Party is now repeating the same tragic mistake the Democrats 
made. You are pandering to a small group of right-wing zealots and extremists 
like Operation Rescue, Jerry Falwell, the National Rifle Assn., Pat Robertson, 
Floyd Brown, etc. Consider this: If the Republican and Democratic parties 
reversed their positions on just abortion rights, gun control and school prayer 
where would the extremists go? 
</P>
<P>
 These zealots have their own agenda for the U.S. and it is not the same agenda 
as most loyal, mainstream Americans have.

country that is destroying itself by not valuing that which could save it from 
its own morbid obesity. We cannot cure our national obesity without the 
surgeons and healers that are in the very groups we look to exclude and blame 
for our own lack of industry. Perhaps that is really what scares Rush and his 
listeners most -- their destiny is in the hands of those they have abused. It 
is in the hands of women, blacks, Latinos and gays. If we are not careful we 
will go the way of his unloved body -- eating, drinking and hating ourselves to 
death.

 * A century ago, people used to say that "God is an Englishman." Now we know 
that was untrue. He is an American. And as an American, he is also a member of 
the Republican Party with a definite political agenda. He is in favor of a 
strong defense and opposed to welfare; he favors the death penalty, three 
strikes and you're out, more prisons and mandatory sentencing, but is against 
abortion, the minimum wage, health reform and gun control. He favors limiting 
immigration and wishes to declare English the nation's official language. 
(Everybody knows that except for a few odd words in Hebrew, God speaks nothing 
but the most dignified English.) 
</P>
<P>
 God definitely is in favor of term limits and a balanced budget amendment, 
wants the line item veto, advocates school vouchers, disapproves of unions, the 
ACLU and the Sierra Club. Most certainly, God is in favor of free trade, 
permanent replacements of strikers, and a lowering of the capital gains tax. 
God distrusts the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World 
Bank. He certainly despises liberals, gays, tree-huggers, the spotted owl, the 
Brady Bill, the National Organization for Women, the Voting Rights Act, 
Democrats in general and Bill and Hillary Clinton in particular. Do I have to 
mention that God only speaks through his new apostles Jerry Falwell, Pat 
Robertson and Rush Limbaugh?

YES, HAVE A LEGAL DEFENSE FUND -- BUT PLEDGE TO REPAY DONORS; PRESIDENCY: THE 
CLINTONS SHOULD REFUSE LOBBYISTS' MONEY AND LIMIT DONATIONS TO $250. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARSHA N. COHEN, Marsha N. Cohen is a professor at UC 's Hastings College of 
the Law in San Francisco. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My act of patriotism this July 4 was to write a check -- a modest one -- to 
the Presidential Legal Expense Trust. I hope many of my fellow citizens will 
join me, and I also hope the President will make some adjustments to the rules 
of the trust and pledge to repay the people for their assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Never before has a sitting President been faced with legal proceedings 
involving actions taken before his election to the White House -- not because 
all earlier presidents were squeaky-clean, but because their political 
opponents had not thought of this tactic. Hurtful allegations are easy to make 
and difficult, expensive and upsetting to defend. While you and I could just 
pay off a plaintiff to eliminate the nuisance and minimize the expense of a 
baseless lawsuit -- something that is done, unfortunately, all too often -- the 
President does not have that option. It is not just for political reasons that 
the President must defend his innocence; the presidency itself must be defended 
from the intrusion of a civil suit while a president is in office. 
</P>
<P>
 For that defense, the President is entitled to the best possible legal 
assistance. Defending the presidency requires raising constitutional issues for 
resolution by the highest court in the land. While not as exciting as the O.J. 
Simpson defense, the issues are more complex and more important. The 
President's lawyers must represent not just this President, but all future 
presidents. And good lawyers cost lots of money. While I am willing to 
contribute my modest share, I am concerned that the trust will accept 
contributions as large as $1,000, with no restrictions on donors. That limit 
should be lowered to $500, if not to $250. Moreover, the President should let 
us know he is not for sale by announcing that the trust will not knowingly 
accept money from lobbyists and people who have business with the government. 
</P>
<P>
 From my experience as a fund-raiser, I know that it is simpler to persuade 
1,000 people to give $1,000 than it is to persuade 20,000 people to give $50. 
But the President is not the Cancer Society or the Red Cross. People give big 
gifts out of generosity and commitment -- and to be recognized as donors. 
Recognition by the President should not be bought and sold.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many citizens might hesitate to contribute because the 
President's earning power so far exceeds their own. The Clintons might well 
earn a great deal of money after leaving the White House: writing best-selling 
books, serving on corporate boards, giving speeches, even practicing law. That 
certainly is their right. But if they do so, shouldn't they pay back our 
generosity in their time of need?  
</P>
<P>
 I think the average citizen would be encouraged to contribute if the Clintons 
would make a public commitment to repay the funds, to the extent they are able 
to do so, into a charitable trust established for a cause -- like medical or 
public-policy research -- that would benefit all Americans.

PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS, A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD; UNLIKE 
THE SIMPSONS, BRANDOS AND MILKENS, MOST DEFENDANTS ARE SQUASHED BY THE 
CRIMINAL-JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES (E.Z.) WILLIAMS, Charles (E.Z.) Williams is in his 16th year of a 
seven-years-to-life sentence for murder at the Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. 
He has been editor of the San Quentin News and Soledad Star News. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is O.J. Simpson getting preferential treatment? 
</P>
<P>
 This question generates its most ardent responses among people who have 
experienced criminal proceedings firsthand. At the California Men's Colony, a 
medium-security prison in San Luis Obispo, consensus on the yard is that 
Simpson is receiving no more and no less consideration than any other criminal 
defendant of stature and means. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is unsettling to many convicts, especially those doing "all day" for 
murder, is Simpson's added advantage in being so well-liked by the American 
public, an affection that appears to mitigate perhaps the alleged crime and 
certainly the possible sentence. Still others hope that saturation media 
coverage in this case will shine a spotlight on these inequities and reveal to 
the world that American "justice" really is just sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the regimented drudgery and forced labor that is prison, the overly 
familiar economic disparities in this country's criminal-justice system raise 
few eyebrows. At least in California, convicts don't believe it mere 
coincidence that 99.9% of the prison population hails from the underclass; 
minorities are the majority here. One inmate calls the economic factors at play 
"the invisible foot of Western jurisprudence," stomping out the futures of 
everyone not wealthy enough to defend themselves. Too many people here are 
doing life for the same crime for which Christian Brando will do barely a 
nickel, and too many larcenists are serving anywhere from five to 10 while 
Michael Milken did just a couple and got to keep half a billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a few cases receiving inordinate amounts of media attention, the 
public perceives the system as favoring the accused over the victims. In 
reality, the process is weighted heavily against the accused. Most convicts 
will tell you that they had the right to a poor defense and a quick and speedy 
trip up the river. 
</P>
<P>
 While Simpson's zillion-dollar defense team gives him the type of muscle 
iron-pumpers here can only dream of, few see it overwhelming the prosecution. 
"He's managed to level the playing field," says one lifer. "He'll get a fairer 
trial than most." "It's heartening to see a defense attorney actually 
challenging evidence," says another. "The D.A. might have to actually prove 
this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The "fair trial" and "presumed innocent" ethics are more myth than reality. 
You are presumed guilty even before arrest, and it's pretty much downhill after 
that. The vast majority of defendants paraded before the bench have little or 
no money and must rely on that form of government assistance known as the 
public defender. There is no bigger joke. Like all forms of public aid, the 
average public defender beats a blank, but not by much. Some are idealists and 
do what they can, but many are inept and all are overburdened and ill-equipped 
to compete with the resources available to the district attorney's office. 
There is nothing fair about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The D.A.'s office, working with police and the press, normally holds all the 
cards. But in Simpson's case, the prosecution's hand will be called every step 
of the way. Standard prosecutorial power plays -- "piling on" excessive 
charges, usually successful in coercing the accused into a plea bargain 
(tantamount to a conviction); putting so-called expert witnesses on the stand 
unchecked; coaching and leading witnesses; validating questionable searches and 
seizures and Miranda violations by police -- will not in this case go 
unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Disputing evidence, challenging testimony, forcing prosecutors to play by the 
rules, these are the legal and necessary rights of every American accused of a 
crime and the moral obligation of every defense attorney. Yet such a defense, a 
real defense, remains beyond the reach of common people. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch the Simpson case and note: It is not about right or wrong or safe 
streets. It is about winning. It is sport, defense versus prosecution; a 
spectator sport, a commodity. It is the Americanized version of the pursuit of 
justice, where intense and relatively equally matched competition will forge 
truths on which a judge and jury will deliberate and base a verdict. And it is 
an anomaly, unavailable to most people.

THEATER REVIEW; 'SISTERS': UNLIKELY FAMILY TIES; WENDY WASSERSTEIN'S STUDY OF 
SIBLINGS RUNS ONLY SKIN-DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man who inexplicably falls for the oldest of "The Sisters Rosensweig," in 
the play of the same name, sells fake furs for a living. He calls them 
"synthetic animal protective coverings." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the play is not as fake as the furs -- Wendy Wasserstein drew on 
aspects of her own family when she wrote it -- it still feels fairly bogus at 
the Doolittle Theatre. The characters are synthetic people in synthetic 
situations. The play's "protective coverings" are the many wisecracks that 
Wasserstein can't resist, no matter how unlikely they may sound at the 
particular moment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if Wasserstein issued a challenge to herself: Throw together a bunch 
of wildly disparate characters. See how they fight, then see how they bond. 
Although four of them have Brooklyn Jewish roots, even these four could hardly 
be less alike. But don't worry how credible any of it seems -- just include 
enough funny lines, and maybe the audience won't notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that Wasserstein was thinking only of laughs. There is 
evidence that she was attempting to make a statement about the value of one's 
roots in general and the danger of Jewish assimilation in particular. She also 
addresses the plight of a woman whose bisexual lover leaves her. 
</P>
<P>
 But these subjects have been treated more perceptively elsewhere. Indeed, the 
Doolittle season that's ending with "Sisters" began with a much more cogent and 
moving play about Jewish assimilation, "Conversations With My Father" -- 
directed by the same Daniel Sullivan who did "Sisters." And the previous 
Doolittle show, "Falsettos," delivered a funnier, more poignant account of a 
woman and the gay man who loved her. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserstein's play is even more reminiscent of "The Three Sisters" -- but only 
because self-conscious, often awkward references to it are scattered 
throughout. They serve primarily as reminders of how much more cohesive and 
touching Chekhov's play is. 
</P>
<P>
 The three sisters here are twice-divorced Sara Goode (Mariette Hartley), a big 
macher for the London branch of an Asian bank; never-married Pfeni Rosensweig 
(Joan McMurtrey), a globe-trotting journalist; and very-married Gorgeous 
Teitelbaum (Caroline Aaron), who's "Dr. Gorgeous," a pop psychologist on Boston 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 They've gathered at Sara's stately townhouse in London to observe Sara's 54th 
birthday. Wasserstein immediately paints their contrasting personalities in 
primary colors. At one point they discuss who's being "too obvious," but 
actually this could be said about nearly everyone in the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara has adopted a quasi-English accent and tends to talk to people as if life 
were one long job interview. Indeed, her regular male escort (Ian Stuart), an 
aristocratic twit, is more of a professional convenience than a personal 
interest. Naturally, her daughter Tess (Debra Eisenstadt) rebels and 
contemplates running off to newly liberated Lithuania with her boyfriend Tom 
(Barry McEvoy) -- that's where his roots are. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley has shifted her posture into high rigidity to portray Sara, and her 
voice is sharply commanding. But she hasn't forgotten that sly smile she used 
so well in her commercials, and it, too, fits Sara, for she's not as humorless 
as her humorless daughter says she is. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley's accomplished performance takes this play deeper than anyone else on 
stage, but she still can't make us believe that Sara would allow a complete 
stranger, the furrier Mervyn Kant (Charles Cioffi), to make a beeline for her 
bedroom within hours after meeting her. Nor can Cioffi convince us that he 
would behave this way with this particular woman, who has all the come-hither 
qualities of a martinet. He doesn't seem all that desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron's Gorgeous gets most of the laughs in the play, because her character 
is, by and large, a cartoon, no more dimensional than Linda Richman on 
"Saturday Night Live." In an interview in the program, Wasserstein said a man 
would have written Gorgeous as "a cliche" -- as if she isn't one now. 
</P>
<P>
 As Pfeni, recently turned 40, McMurtrey is saddled with yet another unlikely 
relationship -- with a bisexual theater director (Richard Frank). Frank pushes 
the gay stereotype so far that Pfeni seems ridiculously naive to hope for a 
satisfying love life with him -- this, from a woman who ought to be the 
worldliest of the sisters. She consoles herself with a renewed interest in 
writing about important subjects. Yeah, sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, to quote one of Gorgeous' favorite phrases, "Pish, pish."

 New Library Home: The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences is moving its 
collection of TV scripts, photographs, books and memorabilia from its North 
Hollywood headquarters to USC's Cinema-Television Library. The move should be 
complete by September. The holdings will be known as the Academy of Television 
Arts & Sciences Foundation Collection, but both the academy and USC will have 
say over future additions. USC Cinema-TV librarian Steve Hanson said that the 
collection, along with USC's existing holdings, will be "one of the nation's 
strongest academic TV archives."

will stick with the CNBC cable channel rather than move to a rumored 
post-Letterman spot on CBS, his boss apparently isn't so sure. CNBC President 
Roger Ailes said this week that he is "confident that we will know one way or 
the other" about Snyder's fate by September. "He obviously believes there is 
still an opportunity there or he would have told us he's still with us," Ailes 
said, adding "we can't get into a bidding war with CBS."

 Forging Ahead: Undaunted by roadblocks that have sprung up for his two 
European public art projects, British filmmaker Peter Greenaway is moving ahead 
with plans to simulate a sunset over the Italian apartment of famed director 
Federico Fellini, who died earlier this year. Italy's Ministry of National 
Heritage, citing security and technical problems, barred Greenaway from going 
ahead with his planned June 20 "The Cosmology of the Piazza del Popolo," an 
evening light-and-music spectacle set in a central Rome plaza where Fellini had 
lived. However, the Italian press and Rome's water and power authority, which 
is sponsoring the project, depicted the cancellation as politically motivated 
and Greenaway has since resubmitted his proposal to the ministry. Target date 
is now autumn or spring, 1995. Earlier this year, Greenaway's critically 
acclaimed Geneva-based exhibit "The Stairs: The Location" -- featuring 99 white 
staircases looking out on points of view of the city -- was tagged by graffiti 
vandals shortly after its April opening. A five-man crew has repeatedly cleaned 
marks off the stairs' plasticized paint coating.

 The Roar Continues: After only 20 days of wide release, Disney's animated film 
"The Lion King" zoomed past the $150-million mark at the nation's box offices 
on Wednesday. That makes it the second fastest film to reach that point, behind 
Universal's "Jurassic Park," which took 15 days. "The Lion King" has now 
outpaced 1989's "Batman," which reached $150 million in 21 days. PEOPLE WATCH

 * Marriage Story Persists: Despite repeated denials from the Jackson camp, 
Dominican officials are continuing to insist that pop star Michael Jackson and 
Elvis' daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, were wed in their country on May 25. In 
the latest wrinkle, Dominican immigration officials said that Jackson and 
Presley, accompanied by a six-person entourage, stayed together at the Casa de 
Campo hotel in Santo Domingo until the following day. Meanwhile, Judge Hugo 
Alvarez Perez, who says he performed the marriage ceremony, continued to offer 
documents allegedly signed by the celebrities, and called denials from 
Jackson's representatives "a horrible lie." "I am prepared to travel to the 
United States to take the records . . . so that an expert on the matter can 
verify that these are their signatures," the judge said. SHAUNA SNOW

MOVIE REVIEW ; 'WEDDING GIFT' A TOUCHING CELEBRATION OF PURE LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Wedding Gift" is a well-made, heartwarming love story involving a devoted 
couple in their 40s confronting the wife's mysterious debilitating illness, 
which is marked by blackouts and has left her disabled to the extent that she 
must wear braces on her hands to keep them from curling inward and use a 
wheelchair much of the time. Since the couple is played by two of the most 
skillful actors in British films, Julie Walters and Jim Broadbent, "The Wedding 
Gift" exudes vitality and good humor. You may be moved to tears, but the 
vivacious Walters, who first made her mark with "Educating Rita," and 
Broadbent, a sort of English Randy Quaid, make the film, which is based on a 
true story, uplifting rather than depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The film opens in a charming small city in the English county of Derbyshire, 
where Broadbent's Deric Longden owns and operates a lingerie factory. He and 
his wife, Diana (Walters), live in a large, comfortable home and have two adult 
children (Andrew Ancel, Anastasia Mulrooney). Deric's forgetful but actually 
quite sharp and doughty mother (Thora Hird) lives nearby. Clearly, Diana and 
Deric have had an exceptionally solid marriage; they're both blessed with 
humor, and they're fast friends as well as lovers. They unhesitatingly, indeed 
reflexively, put each other first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Longdens are too intelligent not to be grateful that they've been lucky, 
but now Diana's illness is putting a rapidly escalating strain on them. Nobody 
has ever made Deric feel so alive as Diana has, and his response to her 
deteriorating condition has been selfless and heroic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of Diana's increasing incapacitation, Deric has seen his 
business lose as much as 10,000 pounds a year and has become so weary caring 
for her that he tends to fall asleep at the wheel of his car. So intense is his 
devotion to Diana, however, that it threatens to suffocate her; he would even 
deny her the pills that would allow her to end her life at the point at which 
she decides her helplessness has become intolerable to her and too crushing a 
burden upon him. What makes the film so touching and endearing lies in the 
strategy that Diana chooses to return Deric's love. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no small dose of sitcom shtick in Jack Rosenthal's script, based on 
the real-life Deric Longden's books, "Diana's Story" and "Lost for Words." But 
it both undercuts the sadness of the Longdens' plight and highlights the 
serious right-to-die issue, plus some sharp commentary on the inefficiency and 
inadequacy of Britain's socialized medicine system. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal also has the knack of deftly characterizing even the film's bit 
parts. This has allowed director Richard Loncraine, best known for two 
delightfully outrageous comedies, "Brimstone and Treacle" and "The Missionary," 
to make everyone seem individual and very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing the stellar acting honors with Walters and Broadbent is the lovely 
Sian Thomas as a near-sightless novelist whose work is much admired by Deric, a 
fledgling writer himself. By the time it ends, "The Wedding Gift" has both 
illuminated and celebrated love in its purest, deepest form.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD' A DISNEY-FIED MORALITY PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The premise of "Angels in the Outfield" is that children -- because they are 
children -- tell the truth. Unlike their elders, kids walk among us as the 
pure-in-heart. When they tell you they see angels, you better believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Motherless angel-gazer Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a ward of the state. 
His father (Dermot Mulroney), leather-jacketed and grubby-looking, tells his 
boy at the start of the film that "we'll be a family again when the Angels win 
the pennant," and zooms off on his motorcycle. It's a kiss-off -- the 
California Angels are in dead-last place. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Roger is visited by Al the Angel (Christopher Lloyd) in the ballpark 
during a typically bumbling Angels performance and, before long, the team is 
rising to first place under the stewardship of a bevy of grinning, winged 
guardians. But only Roger can see them. 
</P>
<P>
 J.P., Roger's best buddy, can't. (He's played by that little charmer Milton 
Davis Jr., who stared down Shaquille O'Neal in a Pepsi commercial.) But J.P. 
believes his friend -- he, too, is orphaned. The film is about how the Angels 
gruff, obscenity-spewing manager, George Knox (Danny Glover), also comes to 
believe. He's purified by his bond with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The sap in this movie rises almost as high as the Angels. It's a special kind 
of kiddie sentimentality: fantastical and self-congratulatory. Children are 
allowed the ability to see the magical in the everyday and then work their 
wisdom on the unbelieving adults in their world. And they do it all in the name 
of love. Roger's special vision, after all, comes from his prayers for a 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball movies have been getting preachier and more peewee-like in recent 
years: consider "The Sandlot," "Rookie of the Year," and, just a few weeks ago, 
"Little Big League." "Angels in the Outfield," loosely remade from a 1951 MGM 
film where the angels were all off-screen, is the drippiest (and the goofiest) 
of the bunch. It's a Disney-fied morality play complete with corn and sniffles. 
Roger may be able to see angels, but he's not particularly wowed by his gift. 
He's too blandly virtuous to get really excited about anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The real kids in this film are the adults -- the players, managers and 
sportscasters. They're the ones who show some temper, some spirit. Just about 
all the funny bits in the movie involve their antics on and off the field: The 
catcher (Tony Longo) gorges on junk food and looks and sounds like Curly from 
the Three Stooges; one of the pitchers (Neal McDonough) is a bundle of tics and 
feints; the team's PR director (Taylor Negron) is continually squirted with 
mustard and glopped with nacho cheese by the two tykes in his charge. (Of 
course, the goody-goodies Roger and J.P. don't do it on purpose.) Ranch Wilder 
(Jay O. Sanders), who was once George's nemesis on the playing field, is the 
big-jawed cartoon meanie who announces the Angels radio broadcasts. He breaks 
the potentially embarrassing story that George's winning streak is 
angel-inspired. (The press conference scene in which George and his teammates 
stand up for the right to believe in miracles isn't exactly up there with the 
Scopes trial from "Inherit the Wind," although it's played just about as 
straight.) 
</P>
<P>
 Director William Dear and screenwriters Dorothy Kingsley, George Wells and 
Holly Goldberg Sloan muster most of their energies for the funny, nutball 
jaunts on the playing field. As the kids' ward, Brenda Fricker, doing her best 
to squelch her Irish accent, is fine in a serious mode, and so is Tony Danza as 
an over-the-hill hurler. But, for the most part, "Angels in the Outfield" is 
tolerable when it's at its loopiest. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick, zoomy shots of the slapstick angels dipping their big bright golden 
wings are funny in an original way. These moments are probably what the adults 
in the audience will take away from the film. And it's probably what kids will 
take away from it too -- along with the squirted mustard and the baseline 
tantrums. They'll blot out the soppy moralizing. After all, kids know they 
don't always tell the truth, even if Hollywood doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for mild language. Times guidelines: It includes a 
father-son separation scene and some mild roughhousing on the playing field.

MUSIC REVIEW; ENTHUSIASM BOLSTERS GAY MEN'S 'STONEWALL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were moments during the 15th anniversary celebration of the Gay Men's 
Chorus of Los Angeles when ideal music for ideal performers met ideal audience. 
Enthusiasm runneth over and belief abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, at the Alex Theater , featured cherished short pieces from the 
group's past and a Southern California premiere of a new work co-commissioned 
by the chorus to commemorate the Stonewall riots of 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Bourland's "Flashpoint/Stonewall," with text by John Hall, was the main 
event of the evening last Saturday . Written in a mixture of pop styles, the 
six-movement 38-minute work is really a piece of musical theater, with 
costumes, choreography, solos, duets, choruses, even lighting effects and 
dramatic situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Strongest musically were the numbers using solo singers, the second movement 
"DreamDrag," a blend of Kurt Weill and the Association vamped stylishly by 
Craig Wheeler (in drag), and the fourth movement, "The Parade," a naive waltz 
in which a young man suddenly and touchingly discovers his place in society. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Bourland's music relies heavily upon Leonard Bernstein and solidly 
enough, though the sheer amount of text makes it less musically interesting. 
The instrumental accompaniment of three synthesizers, drums and bass sounded 
rudimentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Jon Bailey led an assured and robust performance that combined the 
Los Angeles chorus with the visiting Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, though the 
large forces (more than 200) could prove unwieldy at quicker tempos. (The Los 
Angeles group is joined by the Gay Men's Chorus of San Diego for a performance 
of Bourland's work on a program Saturday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre.) 
</P>
<P>
 Before an enjoyable set by the Washington chorus, the local ensemble offered 
an exceptionally executed opening group, tight in ensemble, sensitive in 
phrasing and dynamics, clear in enunciation. Indeed, in its fraternal humor and 
earnest anthems, this seemed like glee club singing at its best.

THEATER REVIEW; OLD GLOBE HOSTAGE DRAMA SHOWCASES ACTORS

<P>
 "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me," Frank McGuinness' 1992 Broadway play about a 
British professor, Irish journalist and American doctor held hostage in a 
Beirut basement, is the ultimate actors' showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 In productions from the West End to Broadway to South Coast Repertory in 
March, McGuinness' question of how three men can survive the boredom of months 
of being chained in a basement has transposed into the theatrical question of 
how three chained actors can hold our attention for nearly two hours on a 
minimal stage set. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Old Globe Theatre's Cassius Carter Centre Stage, Cotter Smith's 
verbally acrobatic Irishman, Richard Easton's literature-loving Englishman and 
Terry Alexander's passionate American do just that in an intermissionless 
version of the play. They mesmerize with wildly imaginative games -- 
re-enacting favorite movies, Wimbledon matches -- even though McGuinness 
doesn't plunge deeply enough into his characters and particularly lacks 
authenticity in the dialogue of the American. 
</P>
<P>
 While this production doesn't solve the script problems, these impeccable 
performances under the sensitive direction of Sheldon Epps subtly show how the 
prisoners watch over one another, keeping madness at bay with the most 
important tools humankind has yet developed -- love, laughter and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me," Old Globe Theatre, Cassius Carter Centre 
Stage, Balboa Park, San Diego. Tuesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.;

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CAFE CAMELLIA: THE SECRET'S IN THE SAUCE(S)

<P>
 I didn't want to go to Bellflower to eat, and nobody I knew wanted to go there 
either. I'd been to enough French and Continental restaurants out in the 
suburbs and eaten my share of murky wine sauces, too much tarragon and strange 
specialties of the house including, at one place, alligator. And I'd dragged my 
friends to enough far-flung fiascoes to make them equally balky. But recently, 
I had a house guest who wanted to take me out to dinner. "If you are a true 
friend," I said, "you would let me take you to Bellflower, to Cafe Camellia." 
</P>
<P>
 I knew nothing about Cafe Camellia, but someone had given me a menu. Except 
for calamari Szechwan and blackened mahi mahi and Cajun shrimp, the menu was 
hard-core Continental (duck liver pate, petrale sole Duglere, escalope of veal, 
duck in cherry sauce). "Continental Drift cuisine," we named it, and my house 
guest announced with great snobbery and ingratitude, "There is nothing here I 
want to eat, except maybe lamb chops." 
</P>
<P>
 We found Cafe Camellia next to a car window tinting shop four blocks north of 
the 91 Freeway on Bellflower Boulevard. The two white-walled dining rooms were 
spare, simple, elegant. The flowers were fresh; the tablecloths damask. We 
scanned an ambitious, lengthy, reasonably priced wine list and ordered 
starters. Fluffy dinner rolls were shaped like amorphous croissants. My guest 
held one up. "The places I've let you drag me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But then came Cajun shrimp, four fat, sweet prawns lightly blackened with 
ground chile and salt; the saltiness was smoothed by a mild pepper cream sauce 
and a tuft of barely cooked spinach added a pleasing vegetal crunch. Next, we 
ate slippery, sexy slices of eggplant marinated in sesame oil and garlic and 
topped with thin, wiry shreds of cheese. By then, we knew we were in seriously 
competent hands, and nothing contradicted this. Spinach salad had only the 
faintest, most beguiling hint of tarragon in its smart, warm lemony dressing. 
White bean soup du jour was a clear, full-bodied broth smoky with good pancetta 
.

 Poached salmon came swathed in an unimaginably light and subtle sour cream 
dill sauce. My surly house guest ate his words along with excellent, juicy lamb 
chops. Entrees were served with beautifully steamed fresh vegetables and true 
scalloped potatoes: sliced potatoes baked in cream. We felt great shame for our 
unwarranted prejudices. In penance, we cleaned our plates. 
</P>
<P>
 That first dinner was the best, partly because of the sheer thrill of having 
our expectations so soundly dashed, and partly because we came rather late on a 
slow evening, and there weren't many other plates vying for the chef's close 
attention. The food was never less than lovely. But that night, the chef agreed 
-- grudgingly -- to make for us a lovely, crusty, custardy chocolate souffle 
with a Gran Marnier sauce for drizzling. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a restaurant of sauces, which sounds -- and is -- retro. Sauces, 
especially cream sauces, have fallen into ill favor precisely because they 
often aren't as varied or restrained as those found here. A spirited fresh 
tomato sauce spikes crunchy bites of creamy, bland fried buffala mozzarella. 
Triangular wedges of calamari stew in a clear sauce of soy, red peppers, onions 
and whole roasted garlic. Poached veal sweetbreads provide a pillow of 
exquisite blandness for a sauce of goose liver and shaved truffles. One risks 
inebriation, however, with forest mushrooms in a brandy cream sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 Salads are fresh and lovely, although the Caesar needs better quality Parmesan 
cheese. The only weak link on the menu is the pasta; the combination pasta 
plate with ravioli, gnocchi and fusilli is dull, and pasta primavera, despite 
lovely fresh vegetables, is gluey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crispy duck" is moist and flavorful, but not crispy. The kitchen does have a 
tendency to repeat itself: Fresh yellowtail, a special, shows up in the same 
spices and pepper cream sauce as the Cajun shrimp and, good as it is, I wish 
I'd tried the escalope of venison, or swordfish with artichokes -- something 
different. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts, from Camellia's sister restaurant, Boulevard Bistro, tend toward 
fussy cakes and tarts. Better to wait for the room to clear, and beg a souffle. 
* Cafe Camellia, 16916 Bellflower Blvd., Bellflower , (310) 866-2824. Open for 
lunch Monday-Friday, dinner seven nights. Beer and wine served. Major credit 
cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $25-$66.

JAZZ NOTES: RECAPTURING THE GRANDEUR OF 'THAD JONES / MEL LEWIS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There has never been, and chances are there will never be, a big band quite 
like the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based ensemble played gorgeous, swinging music, mostly by 
cornetist-trumpeter Jones. This music was an intoxicating combination of Duke 
Ellington's mahogany-tinged tonal luster, Count Basie's stuff-strutting whammy 
and shimmer, Charlie Parker's mad melodic whirl and, occasionally, the heady 
brain-driven work of Stravinsky, Webern and Bartok. 
</P>
<P>
 "That music was mesmerizing and thrilling. It was the ultimate as far as a big 
band was concerned," says Garnett Brown, the L.A.-based trombonist who was with 
the orchestra from its inception in 1965 until 1970. "There was a lightness and 
airiness to this music that was absolutely fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-led by drummer Lewis, the orchestra's larder was stocked with some of 
Manhattan's finest jazzmen, among them trombonists Brown and Bob Brookmeyer, 
saxmen Pepper Adams and Joe Farrell, trumpeters Richard Williams and Snooky 
Young, and bassist Richard Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandeur and smack this great band offered are in plain view on "The 
Complete Solid State Recordings of the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra," a 
five-CD/seven-LP set just released on Mosaic Records. The collection, which 
documents the band's first five years, makes available material that has long 
been out of print, including many tracks that have been remixed for sound 
clarity. Five previously unissued tracks are also included. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the time-tested selections here are Jones' now-standard ballad, the 
pensive, misty "A Child Is Born"; the crisp and demanding "The Little Pixie"; 
the come-hither back-beaters "A-Hunk, A-Hunk" and "Don't Get Sassy"; deep, 
probing versions of "Willow Weep for Me" and "St. Louis Blues" (both penned by 
Brookmeyer); and such pretty ditties as "Don't Ever Leave Me." 
</P>
<P>
 The set, priced at $75 for CD and $91 for LP, is available by mail only from 
Mosaic, 35 Melrose Place, Stamford, Conn. 06902. Information: (203) 327-7111. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Man With a Style: Singer-guitarist John Pizzarelli is just 34, but the 
native New Yorker looks back several decades for his chief vocal influence: Nat 
King Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first heard Nat in 1980, and his style was more approachable, more 
reachable as a singer," says Pizzarelli, the son of noted guitarist Bucky 
Pizzarelli. "Whereas someone like Frank Sinatra is untouchable. The songs he 
does are more than just songs, they're his songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Pizzarelli -- who, with his brother Martin Pizzarelli (bass) and Ray Kennedy 
(piano), appears Wednesday and Thursday at the Jazz Bakery in Culver City -- 
has an appealing, unaffected voice that recalls Harry Connick Jr. at his best. 
"I'm probably more a musician's singer, than a singer's singer," Pizzarelli 
says. "I'm a musician first, even though I sang as a kid, and have always 
sung." 
</P>
<P>
 On his two previous Novus recordings, Pizzarelli has focused on great pop 
tunes, but for his just-out recording "New Standards" he takes another tack. 
The songs are not overly done, from the recent Robert Craft and Arnie Glimcher 
ballad "Beautiful Maria of My Soul" from the film "The Mambo Kings" to the 
kitschy Rosemary Clooney song from the early '50s, "Come On-A My House," which 
cooks along heartily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to do something fresh," he says. And he did. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pizzarelli plays Wednesday and Thursday, 8 p.m., at the Jazz Bakery, 3221 
Hutchison Ave., Culver City. $15, refreshments included. Information: (310) 
271-9039.  
</P>
<P>
 Critic's Choices: Guitar great Joe Pass, who died last month, will be feted at 
a memorial tribute, to be held Sunday, 2-5 p.m., at the Musicians Institute 
(1655 N. McFadden Place, Hollywood). On tap will be many of the town's top 
guitarists, among them John Pisano, Al Viola, Frank Potenza, Doug MacDonald and 
Mundell Lowe. Tickets are $5 and $10. Information: (213) 462-1384.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LUNA UP FROM THE UNDERGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Luna is awfully polite to its elders, chief among them the Velvet Underground. 
Still, the New York band's well-executed show on Wednesday at the Coach House 
here offered plenty of satisfying guitar lyricism, quietly appealing vocal 
melodies and assured, if controlled, rhythmic thrust.Even in this 
much-tempered, borrowed version, the Velvets' method has lasting appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 In his diffident way, Luna's slightly built, small-voiced leader Dean Wareham 
has managed to make the music of his forebears serve his own songwriting 
vision, which is all one can ask of a rock traditionalist. Just as he submits 
to the musical past with faithful restraint, the characters who move through 
Wareham's songs are submissive sorts who accumulate numerous psychic bruises 
but lack the moxie to protest, to resist, to make demands. 
</P>
<P>
 While the band's latest album, "Bewitched," is often becalmed by all this 
passivity, Luna mixed in enough harder-driving material from its "Lunapark" 
debut and from such outside sources as Steve Wynn and Talking Heads to offer a 
balanced, 70-minute set. The band pushed hard at times, but never really broke 
loose: The wild, weird, experimental side of the Velvets championed by Sonic 
Youth just isn't Luna's style. MIKE BOEHM

THEATER BEAT: CLEVER WRITING LIFTS AMBITIOUS 'DISCIPLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playwright Tom Jacobson is a linguistic gadfly. Often, you are tickled by him. 
Occasionally, you are bedeviled by him. Once or twice, you just want to swat 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Linguistic pyrotechnics explode in Jacobson's period verse drama "The Beloved 
Disciple," now at the Complex. Set in plague-swept London in the late 1500s, 
the play concerns the friendship between Elizabethan playwright Christopher 
Marlowe (Cully Fredricksen) and the young, wealthy Earl of Southampton (Matthew 
Wagner). Down on his luck and out of favor with the crown, Marlowe enters into 
a contest with an itinerant Actor (Robert Kerbeck) to determine who will win 
the Earl's favor and, ultimately, his patronage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrown together for the term of the wager, Marlowe, the Actor and the Earl 
launch into rehearsals of Marlowe's newest play "The Beloved Disciple," a 
dangerously blasphemous drama that will ultimately prove Marlowe's downfall. In 
this play within a play, Christ is portrayed as an outright charlatan whose 
success is more attributable to the efforts of his disciple/spin doctor Judas 
Iscariot than to his own divinity. More shocking, however, is Marlowe's 
depiction of Christ's fleshly love for his "beloved disciple" John. As 
Marlowe's play evolves, so does Marlowe's sexual fascination for the young 
Earl, his own disciple of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known of Marlowe's life. It is certain that he was an atheistic 
iconoclast whose heretical views placed him in constant danger of arrest. The 
motive for his murder in 1593 remains murky. 
</P>
<P>
 In this clever attempt to solve the mystery, Jacobson's precocious use of 
language is rivaled only by the sheer effrontery of his subject matter. 
Jacobson's themes, particularly in his play within a play, are so radically 
modern that they seem anachronistic to the period that he otherwise captures so 
masterfully. Surely, in light of the times, this blatant heresy would have been 
shrouded in metaphor and mystery, even if Marlowe's motives in writing the play 
were "suicidal," as Jacobson implies. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's production values are somewhat skimpy, but Fred Sanders' direction 
is clever, as are the performances by Wagner, Fredricksen and Kerbeck. As for 
Jacobson, he may not quite pull off his ambitious verse drama, but he flirts 
with brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Beloved Disciple," Complex, 6470 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Fridays, 8 p.m. Ends July 22. $15. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 
hours, 15 minutes. 'Mustard' a Look at Diseased Relationship 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Gina Wendkos has a decided knack for portraying society's 
disenfranchised. Her "Dirty Mustard" at the Alliance Repertory Company concerns 
the spasmodic courtship of self-proclaimed losers Rick and Jamie. More 
disenfranchised than these two you just don't get. 
</P>
<P>
 The hopeless, homeless Jamie (Suzan Fellman), who never got over her father's 
suicide years ago, expects the worst from life, and gets it. Rick (Scott Allan 
Campbell), whose education ended with grade school, is not at all put off by 
Jamie's prickliness. Just a few minutes after meeting her in a neighborhood 
bar, Rick tells Jamie he's going to marry her. It may be that Rick is a pure 
romantic at heart. Then again, maybe he's just trying to get lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a timely story -- boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy bashes girl. 
Typically, Wendkos treats her subject with restraint. Sometimes, however, her 
dialogue is self-consciously outlandish, a bad Sam Shepard/John Shanley 
imitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellman's performance captures the full force of Jamie's propulsive misery. 
Also skillful, Campbell is hampered by the fact that Wendkos never sufficiently 
develops his character. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Kristen Cloke referees the heated volleys of dialogue with a keen 
sense of pacing and purpose, almost mitigating Wendkos' lapses into silliness. 
However, Wendkos' missteps are few. The playwright artfully blends the tender 
and the visceral in this depiction of a diseased relationship, which leaves us 
hoping for a happy ending, much like an abused spouse keeps hoping, in all 
defiance of reality. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Dirty Mustard," Alliance Repertory Company, 3204 W. Magnolia Blvd., 
Burbank. Tuesdays-Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Aug . 3. $12. (818) 566-7935. Running 
time: 1 hour, 40 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 'Live and In Color' Looks for Laughs 
</P>
<P>
 "Live and In Color," Danitra Vance's series of comic sketches, currently 
playing at the Ebony Showcase, is an uneven effort that seems too slight for a 
full production. 
</P>
<P>
 More popularly known as an actress-comic, Vance tackles subjects as diverse as 
wife abuse, transsexualism, PMS and AIDS. Her characters may be vivid, but her 
point of view is distressingly desultory. An impassioned take on AIDS blurs 
into a diatribe about women and breast cancer that leaves us wondering what 
exactly Vance is trying to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Lamont directs a lively cast, which includes Thea Perkins, Yvette Davis, 
Tangie Ambrose, Rhonda Walker and Melanie Lee. These performers give their all 
in the pursuit of belly laughs -- and get their fair share. However, they are 
only as good as their material, and this particular material is only 
intermittently amusing.

THEATER BEAT: 'HURLYBURLY' A CHILLING REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In revisiting the self-indulgence of the '80s, the Onstage Company's dead-on 
revival of David Rabe's "Hurlyburly" proves too close for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 There's enough resonance in this stark, biting and ultimately chilling 
portrait of upscale hedonism -- bereft of human values -- that it's impossible 
to appreciate its craftsmanship with tranquil detachment. Of course, that's 
director Bruce Blair's point, and his seamless cast ensures audiences are 
thoroughly unsettled despite their laughter.  
</P>
<P>
 From the opening -- a searing, misogynistic perversion of "buddy" film 
dialogue between hung-over Eddie (James Shanta) and edgy, divorce-bound Phil 
(James Nardini) -- the inhabitants of Rabe's Hollywood establish their turf as 
a "spinoff of what was once prime-time life." 
</P>
<P>
 This bleak terrain is both playground and prison for Phil, Eddie, Eddie's glib 
roommate Mickey (Michael Hartson) and the assorted trash that parade through 
Nelson Coates' ironically pristine white condo set at the Ventura Court 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rabe's Hollywood, power and manipulation make up the only ethics of 
conduct. It's a world view that recalls David Mamet's obsession with 
domination, although Rabe permits his characters more self-aware eloquence. Not 
that it does them any good -- "I feel like I've pushed thought to the point 
where it's just noise," moans Phil. 
</P>
<P>
 While they all excel in their ability to reinvent reality, Eddie earns the 
grandmaster title with his response to a stripper's (Cynthia Ettinger) 
complaint that Phil threw her out of a moving car: "So what -- he slowed down, 
didn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
 The most unnerving scene is when we glimpse Eddie out of his usual 
drug-induced haze, aping social respectability. He sounds sincere mouthing the 
cliches of meaningful relationship to his photographer girlfriend (Lynn Clark) 
-- until suspicion and cunning ooze to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers never lose their focus during the marathon evening, but Rabe's 
circuitous path through thematically redundant territory becomes tedious at 
times. The characters keep their energy aloft by consuming vast quantities of 
simulated cocaine -- we can only hope the cast's nostrils survive the run. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hurlyburly," Ventura Court Theatre, 12417 Ventura Court, Studio City. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Aug. 7. $15. (213) 466-1767. 
Running time: 3 hours, 25 minutes. A Tart-Tongued 'Mona Rogers' 
</P>
<P>
 Chain-smoking, booze-toting tawdry ex-burlesque queen Mona Rogers calls 
herself "the most photogenic piece of hell that ever barked back at shop 
windows because they dared reflect her." 
</P>
<P>
 That's an accurate assessment as Roxanne Rogers brings convincing intensity to 
Mona's peculiar brand of self-awareness and social commentary in an 
acid-tongued solo performance piece, "Mona Rogers in Person," at Highways. 
</P>
<P>
 In this anthology of brief, scathing monologues by the late Philip- Dimitri 
Galas, Mona wages an unbroken assault on convention and complacency, lashing 
out at the audience, her minimal furniture and even her doll companion, Little 
Fatty. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a lot of control to be this out of control, and Rogers hits all the 
right notes in Galas' homage to sour grapes on a cosmic scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Mona's ramblings careen from inflated self-aggrandizement to suicidal 
self-loathing, but sustain throughout the kind of violent eloquence reminiscent 
of Charles Bukowski on a lucid day. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cheat, of course -- the gutter is rarely the aqueduct of insight 
Bukowski or Galas celebrate. Mona implicitly acknowledges this with a sly wink 
to the audience, asking if we want to try her glamorous existence -- she gets 
plenty of laughs but no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its hot-blooded imagery, the rhetoric of "Mona Rogers in Person" moves 
the viewer mainly to smirks and snickers -- not much of a legacy once Rogers' 
high-energy delivery has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mona Rogers in Person," Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica, Saturdays, 
10:30 p.m. Ends July 30. $10. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 1 hour.

ART REVIEWS; MOLLURA FILLS A GALLERY TO MAKE A STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For his first solo show, Carlos Mollura has placed a giant vinyl balloon in 
the back gallery at Food House. Filled with air, the clear plastic bubble 
presses tightly against the walls and floor, bulges out of the single entrance, 
and swells around the rafters above, completely filling the rectangular space. 
Made from almost nothing but air, Mollura's installation is funny and 
intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, it seems to be a one-liner, merely repackaging the well-lighted, 
white-walled gallery as a commodity to be consumed. But the Argentina-born, 
L.A.-based artist's clever piece is much more than an art-school rehash of 
1970s Conceptualism, or another watered down, institutional critique spawned by 
that style. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at, pushing into and leaning against his bulbous bubble is strangely 
satisfying. The resilient balloon physically demonstrates art's vulnerable 
place in a culture generally hostile to its pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 A pin-prick of violence would easily deflate it. Yet, giving Mollura's blow-up 
sculpture a little space quickly initiates a rewarding exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 By preventing viewers from entering the gallery, his piece insists that art is 
necessarily exclusive -- that its capacity to bring viewers together is 
meaningless if we don't also acknowledge art's power to tear people apart, to 
divide us into antagonistic groups. Medical quarantines and political 
segregation are also evoked by Mollura's fragile bag of air. 
</P>
<P>
 The most conservative sort of formalism, which insists upon art's hermetic 
autonomy, merges with social issues in his work. The young artist's empty yet 
loaded installation is at once aesthetically resolved and promising. It marks 
an auspicious debut. 
</P>
<P>
 * Food House, 2220 Colorado Blvd., Bldg. 4, Santa Monica, (310) 449-1030, 
through July 23. Closed Sundays through Tuesdays.  
</P>
<P>
 * World View: Sebastiao Salgado's majestic photographs of anonymous men and 
women from around the world depict people either as cogs in some vast, 
alienating machinery or as unique individuals, with their own desires, 
expressions and outlooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite pictures of famine in Africa, brutish labor in Brazil, sweatshops in 
Kazakhistan and burning oil wells in Kuwait, the Brazil-born, Paris-based 
photojournalist's 41 silverprints at Fahey/Klein Gallery present a generally 
reassuring world view. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to see that Salgado's images of children contribute to this effect. 
A Guatemalan girl carrying a tray of candied apples on her head, a tree full of 
Thai boys playing in the sun and three little Mexican girls dressed up like 
angels for first communion capture the charming, wide-eyed wonder of carefree 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 When Salgado focuses on a single Indian coal miner or farmer, a Bangladeshi 
ship breaker or weaver, or a Cuban construction worker, human dignity is 
emphasized. His beautifully composed photographs suggest that their subjects 
are never dehumanized by the back-breaking labor they regularly perform. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Salgado's pictures of a Brazilian gold mine in Serra Pelada are more 
complicated. Here, 50,000 workers swarm like ants, descending into a vast, 
muddy hole 60 times a day to carry out sacks of dirt. In these daunting images, 
individuals disappear. Inhuman activity subsumes people in an awesome, 
mind-numbing spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, this series does not detract from Salgado's romantic view of the 
world. Although ugliness and suffering are part of the picture, a profound 
sense of optimism remains central to his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fahey/Klein Gallery, 148 N. La Brea Ave., (213) 934-2250, through Sept. 3. 
Closed Sundays and Mondays.  
</P>
<P>
 * Ambiguous: Surrealism began with shocking provocations. In the 1920s and 
1930s, its painters and poets sought to expose the violent, psycho-sexual 
underpinnings of modern society. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gambill's paintings and drawings at Rosamund Felsen Gallery tip 
Surrealism on its ear. Rather than shouting about life's absurdity, his 
ambiguous images whisper some of its secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The biomorphic blobs in the 38-year-old's paintings appear to drift between 
being meaty and weightless. Sometimes, these strange forms have the substance 
of mutant organisms; at other times, they look like gaseous vapors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnant with uncertainty, Gambill's restrained version of Surrealism hints at 
significance. Occasionally, a recognizable object such as a frog, turtle, cob 
of corn or flash of lightning suggests a clear story. Stripped of supporting 
material, however, these vivid depictions serve only to intensify the general 
sense of mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Gambill's imaginary landscapes are poised on the brink of intelligibility, 
like a word on the tip of your tongue that you just can't utter. Evoking a 
stream-of-consciousness that flows into outer space, his paintings seem more 
animated by curiosity than driven by a fear of the unknown.

 Unlike classic Surrealism, which directed its energy toward repressed sex and 
dread, Gambill's open-ended art leaves its meanings -- and its viewers -- up in 
the air, drifting in a beguiling dream-state where imprecise memories float.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; A LONG, THOUGHTFUL TAKE ON 'SHORT CUTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first thing you notice about Criterion's wonderfully inventive and 
informative laser-disc edition of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" ($125) is that 
it is anything but short. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably more layered, intricate and artfully crafted than the 1993 film 
itself, the three-disc set requires you not only to just spend time with it, 
but also to work at it. It's not something you're going to curl up with on 
Saturday date night. But then again, neither is the bleak film-mosaic spun by 
Altman and co-writer Frank Barhydt from nine Raymond Carver short stories and a 
poem. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of Criterion's best laser discs -- which still set the standard for 
careful laser-disc production as well as film reproduction -- you get a lot for 
your money. With "Short Cuts," you get more than most. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc captures the complete Altman cinematic vision, since it is presented 
letterboxed in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 2:35:1, transferred 
under the watchful eyes of cinematographer Walt Lloyd and editor Geraldine 
Peroni. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included is the complete text of the Carver stories and poem on which the 
film is based. Nicely printed on the screen, the stories provide more 
information on the characters in the film, since only two of them are in a form 
fairly close to Carver's. The rest offer dramatic themes and characters that 
capture Carver's sense of urban isolation and misunderstandings, transported by 
Altman from the Northwest to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two deleted scenes and an alternate take of one scene are on sides five and 
six, along with Mike Kaplan and John Dorr's excellent documentary on the making 
of the film, "Luck, Trust, and Ketchup: Robert Altman in Carver Country." One 
of the few such documentaries that enhances the viewing of a complex film, it 
offers interviews with virtually all 22 actors who made up this film troupe as 
well as Carver's widow (poet Tess Gallagher), and other creative people behind 
the scenes. Plus, of course, Altman himself. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's not enough, there's also the theatrical trailer, a teaser trailer, 
television spots, production stills, cast portraits and marketing material. 
</P>
<P>
 Two analog tracks can be played under the documentary soundtrack: an interview 
with former New Yorker critic and Altman champion Pauline Kael, and an audio 
essay by Michael Wilmington, a former film reviewer for the Los Angeles Times 
who is now film critic of the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 Another unique feature is that, in addition to the digitally reproduced Dolby 
soundtrack, you can listen to two analog tracks during the film's 183 minutes 
that present just the classical, jazz and pop music and effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got people who don't usually write this kind of music to write songs for 
(jazz singer-actress) Annie Ross," reports music director Hal Willner. Among 
those contributors were Elvis Costello, Bono, Horace Silver, Terry Adamus, and 
Doc Pomus & Mac Rebennack. There is also the Trout Quintet performing Dvorak's 
Cello Concerto in D Minor as well as actress Lori Singer playing Bach's Cello 
Suite No. 5 in C Minor, among other pieces. All are carefully noted by chapter 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 This edition cleverly helps you cut across the separate, criss-crossing 
stories so that you can follow each "family," or disintegrating family, 
separately, by programming directly to specific chapter stops, something no 
laser edition in recent memory has tried before. 
</P>
<P>
 The aspirations of the laser production match the reach of the film itself. 
"The subtext of everything that's going on is extraordinarily dark," notes 
actor Buck Henry, "but the stuff that dances on the surface is funny and comic, 
and then hits you in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on at every level is the playing out of ordinary lives during 
ordinary and not-so-ordinary moments, riffs on a theme variously called 
entrancing, wayward, redundant, antic, alarmingly dispassionate, roaringly 
funny, telling and profound, cynical, sexist and shallow, and rich and 
unnerving by American critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Altman understatedly articulates what "Short Cuts" is all 
about: "The common denominator is ketchup -- ketchup and a little alcoholism 
and a little infidelity and a little self-doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 This ambitious laser was overseen by producer Karen Rosen Stetler and 
executive producer Peter Becker.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; IT'S 'MORPHIN' TIME WITH REVAMPED VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tapes of "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," the biggest hit in the kidvid 
market in years, have been repackaged and slightly revamped. 
</P>
<P>
 So don't be surprised when the kids try to talk you into buying the versions 
that just hit the market. Pointing out that they already have the original tape 
or that they've already seen the show on Fox isn't likely to change their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 The packaging change -- live-action scenes replacing illustrations -- isn't as 
important as the additions. What the kids are so eager to get is the 
three-minute interview footage at the end of the 10 tapes -- a different 
segment on each one featuring the Rangers answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the simple strategy, said Nancy Jones, vice president of sales and 
marketing for Saban Home Entertainment, which markets the tapes: "We give the 
consumer the TV episode plus an added value they don't get on TV, which is the 
interview. Kids are so into this series that they want anything new that's 
involved with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the series came out at the end of last year, 10 tapes have sold an 
estimated 6 million copies. The revamped tapes, Jones said, should sell another 
2 million by September. 
</P>
<P>
 The first five tapes were priced at $10 each. But Jones said that's low for a 
hot half-hour kid's tape. So when it was clear the "Power Rangers" series was a 
runaway hit, the price of the next five, released in March, jumped to $13 each. 
Now all 10 sell for $13 each. 
</P>
<P>
 With the release of the repackaged tapes featuring the interviews, look for 
retailers to discount the original 10 videos. But with kids wanting what's hot, 
the old tapes aren't likely to be that popular, even at bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In September three new titles are due, Jones said, all featuring another 
tantalizing extra -- music videos that haven't been seen on TV. A Christmas 
tape is also due in October. Those four tapes, she projected, will sell 5 
million copies by the end of the year, swelling the grand total to a staggering 
13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Another change will occur Aug. 31. The Saban series will shift distributors, 
from PolyGram to A*Vision Entertainment. The change isn't expected to affect 
consumers but it certainly will affect PolyGram's profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest: 
</P>
<P>
 If you're interested in videos about Irish history, your best bet is Irish 
Visions USA, a small, Bronx-based company that's one of only a handful making 
videos about Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 The showpiece of Irish Visions' small catalogue is "When Ireland Starved," an 
absorbing, beautifully made documentary about the potato famine, priced at $30 
-- the most expensive of the company's six-title catalogue. The latest is "The 
Guide to Celtic Monasteries," which uses photographs, drawings and films to 
detail the austere life of the monks. It's part history and part travelogue, 
offering glimpses of sites tourists might want to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Though limited to historical documentaries right now, there are plans to add 
music videos and kidvid, co-owner Martin Somers said. He said the catalogue 
should have eight titles by the end of the year, with 10 more due out next 
year. "Our goal is to educate people about Irish history and about what's 
happening at present in Ireland," Somers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Titles are available mainly through mail order: (800) 474-7480. What's New on 
Video: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sister Act 2: Back to the Habit" (Touchstone). In the original -- one of the 
best formula, feel-good movies in years -- a tawdry lounge singer (Whoopi 
Goldberg) hides out in a convent. The nuns bring out the best in her while she 
knocks some of the stodginess out of them. In the sequel, she returns to the 
nunnery to school a bunch of thugs in music. It's nowhere near as engaging as 
the original, but if you like Goldberg, it's passable entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shadowlands" (HBO). In early 1950s England, a repressed, scholarly British 
bachelor (Anthony Hopkins) falls in love with a brash American poet (Debra 
Winger) who later develops cancer. What's basically a romantic tear-jerker 
about opposites attracting is elevated by remarkable performances by Hopkins 
and Oscar nominee Winger. Based on a true story about theologian C.S. Lewis.  
</P>
<P>
 "Reality Bites" (MCA/Universal). Underneath all the trendy Generation X 
trappings, this is an old-fashioned romantic comedy, about a TV production 
assistant (Winona Ryder) being wooed by a strait-laced executive (Ben Stiller) 
and a carefree musician (Ethan Hawke). Charming, lightweight entertainment 
geared to the late teens and twentysomething crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blink" (New Line). In this thriller set in Chicago, a feisty, blind fiddler 
(Madeleine Stowe) is the target of a serial killer. The twist on the usual plot 
about a blind woman being stalked by a murderer is that she's slowly regaining 
her sight. After an intriguing first half, setting up her character and her 
relationship with the cop (Aidan Quinn) investigating the murders, the second 
half turns routine thriller. Still, it's worth a look. Directed by Michael 
Apted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Body Snatchers" (Warner). The second remake of the 1956 sci-fi classic 
"Invasion of the Body Snatchers" is directed by Abel Ferrara. It's arty, 
offbeat and good, creepy fun -- boasting some truly scary moments. The story is 
the same -- a slow takeover by aliens creating a society of conformists. 
Ferrara offers a different perspective, setting it on a military base, from the 
point of view of a teen-age girl (Gabrielle Anwar). Meg Tilly co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heaven and Earth" (Warner). A Vietnamese woman (Hiep Thi Li) brutalized by 
the war marries a Marine (Tommy Lee Jones) and moves to California, where her 
trauma continues. Director Oliver Stone's third movie about the Vietnam War 
(after "Platoon" and "Born on the Fourth of July") is the first to center on a 
female character and is by far the weakest. What could have been a taut, tragic 
drama is just a superficial soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
 "House Party 3" (New Line). If you liked the first two tales about the comic 
exploits of the footloose characters played by rappers Kid 'N' Play, you might 
like some of part three, which is as thinly plotted as the first two. The 
original was a frolicking funfest but this one, riddled with unfunny jokes, is 
just a stale sequel.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LUNA CASTS LONG SHADOW ON INNER EMOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rock fans who crave daring, innovation and an assertive stance in their music 
aren't apt to take a shine to Luna. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's leader, Dean Wareham, is a small, slight fellow with a wan, 
murmuring singing voice and the personal magnetism of a loan officer. No 
stylistic adventurer, Wareham is content to follow in the well-trod path of the 
East Coast underground guitar-rock tradition that was handed down from the 
Velvet Underground in the '60s to Television in the '70s and the Feelies in the 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna, which debuted in 1992, is the latest representative in that line. With 
each generation the bands in the V.U. tradition have grown a little less vivid, 
a little less dramatic and daring, and a little less distinctive -- with the 
exception of Sonic Youth, the '80s-vintage black sheep of the family that has 
pursued new directions suggested by the Velvets' darker, noisier, more 
experimental side. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna is polite in its interpretation of what the elders have handed down. 
Still, the four-piece band's well-executed show at the Coach House on Wednesday 
offered plenty of satisfying guitar lyricism, quietly appealing vocal melodies, 
and assured, if controlled, rhythmic thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this tempered version, the Velvets' method has lasting appeal. 
(Actually, Luna has appropriated only a narrow slice of that method. The band 
draws on the gentler side of the Velvets; it's hard to imagine the introverted 
Wareham mustering the sense of theater and pure rock 'n' roll swagger that Lou 
Reed brought to "Heroin," "Waiting For the Man," "Sweet Jane" or "White 
Light/White Heat"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his diffident way, however, Wareham has managed to make the music of his 
forebears serve his own songwriting vision, which is all one can ask of a rock 
traditionalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he submits to the musical past with faithful restraint, the characters 
who move through Wareham's songs are submissive sorts who accumulate numerous 
psychic bruises but lack the moxie to protest, to resist, to make demands. They 
accept what's dealt them and hope for the best, ruefully resign themselves to 
seasons of pain, or subside into depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a Luna protagonist will realize change is necessary, but it's left 
doubtful whether action will in fact ensue. In "Slash Your Tires," Wareham 
envisions rising up against an antagonist, but this retaliation takes place 
only "in my dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to suggest that Wareham endorses passivity; only that introversion 
and inhibition make up the slice of emotional life that interests him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Luna's current album, "Bewitched," which really ought to be called 
"Becalmed," we see romantic troubles mulled over internally, but never brought 
to a crisis or a confrontation. The band offers a dreamy, gently wafting, 
album-length soak that should offer a bath of sympathy for those wanting to 
salve wounds at the end of a rotten day or a rotten relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Though fine for a sweetly miserable wallow at home, "Bewitched" didn't hold 
great promise as fodder for a live performance. But by weaving in more emphatic 
material from its debut album, "Lunapark," as well as hard-edged cover material 
from Talking Heads ("Thank You For Sending Me An Angel") and Steve Wynn 
("That's What You Always Say"), the band managed to mix things up and sustain 
interest over the course of its 70-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
 The slower numbers never dragged, and sometimes attained a stately, elegiac 
stature. Among them was a cover of the Velvet Underground's world-weary anthem, 
"Ride Into the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's rockers may not have thundered over the top, but they did move 
confidently, pushed along by the firm, concise drumming of Stanley Demeski, 
formerly of the Feelies. 
</P>
<P>
 The twin-guitar work of Wareham and Sean Eden was consistently interesting, 
with Eden favoring a thicker, Neil Young-influenced tone, and Wareham often 
spinning out trebly, piercing lead runs. Both used distortion liberally, not to 
inject currently fashionable chaos, but as a device for coloring their strictly 
melodic playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wareham's tuneful but meek singing suited his themes, and it came through 
clearly thanks to an excellent sound mix. He stretched beyond his range in 
attempting the high notes of "Hold On," from John Lennon's "Plastic Ono Band" 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 After laying out most of the set in a predictable sequence that alternated 
between dreamy slow songs and springy rocking numbers, Luna built some momentum 
near the end. The band never broke loose, though -- just not its style. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feelies also was a band of reserved personalities, but part of the 
fascination of that group's shows was watching how, over the course of a 
concert, the force of the music would take hold and infuse those introverts 
with the spirit of leaping, jerking scissors-kicking dervishes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Luna, a band for which a wan grin or an ironic aside was the height of 
demonstrativeness, liberation from inhibition is not yet here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Red Red Meat, a Chicago band that records for Seattle's Sub Pop label, is also 
deeply grounded in venerable rock traditions -- especially the rough-hewn 
roots-rock of "Exile On Main Street"-era Rolling Stones and the ragged, druggy, 
dejected country sound of Neil Young's classic mid-'70s album, "Tonight's The 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than fall in place behind hall-of-fame leaders, the band strains to 
find ways around their imposing shadows. On its current album, "Jimmywine 
Majestic," Red Red Meat stretches for originality by playing songs that are 
noisier and more disjointed than its predecessors'. In concert, though, the 
band didn't press the point, choosing material that kept the distortion in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 Fronted by a chatty, affable singer, Tim Rutili, Red Red Meat began with an 
open-hearted homage to its roots, dabbing only scant hints of distortion onto 
"You Don't Miss Your Water," a country song from the Gram Parsons catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutili's homespun voice became submerged when the guitars kicked in after 
that, but some nice Mick-and-Keith harmonies still popped out, with bassist Tim 
Hurley taking the part of Keith. The words were lost, but Rutili's lyrics, with 
their strands of opaque images, are largely impenetrable in any case. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhythm proved to be the band's strength, as drummer Brian Deck laid down a 
sparse, funky Charlie Watts thwack. Joining him was a percussionist who lent a 
wry touch by tapping on beer bottles and a shiny metal bedpan, among other 
unusual implements. 
</P>
<P>
 It made for a reasonably enjoyable set. But Red Red Meat's material ultimately 
wasn't persuasive. Using guitar dissonance, the band scuffed and dented the 
sound of its idols to achieve something different. But instead of whetting the 
appetite for more Meat, the show mainly made one want to seek out the original 
designs, dents not included.

TV REVIEWS; 'EARTHQUAKE!' NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with more than a little trepidation that I agreed to review 
"Earthquake! What We Know Now." Frankly, I'm still quaking from the Jan. 17 
temblor, and, as a daily reminder of that lovely event, I only have to look 
around my house, which still has a fair amount of damage that hasn't been 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 My feelings of anxiety were on the mark: "Earthquake!" starts off with scary 
images of the 1933 Long Beach quake and a voice-over from a survivor, then 
launches into a jarring series of jump cuts of the Northridge disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is this confined to the intro: Frightful scenes of death, injury and 
massive destruction are shown over and over again throughout the hourlong 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing pounding of these images undermines the "effort to share 
important new information which has been uncovered since the Northridge quake." 
Done in by its own graphics, this self-described attempt to "empower viewers 
with the latest essential earthquake safety tips" will probably find a far 
smaller audience left by the last segment, which, ironically, is a decent 
safety primer with some useful material. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's too bad, because "Earthquake!" is a much-needed reminder that there 
are faults all over the Southland, that we live in what one seismologist calls 
an "active phase in earthquake history" and that the only thing we do know is 
that we have to prepare as best we can for the inevitable mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The information in "Earthquake! What We Know Now" is vital. Ignore the 
messenger, learn from the message. 
</P>
<P>

TV REVIEWS; 'BLUE': NO IMAGES, BUT MANY MESSAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The final, mesmerizing work by the recently deceased British filmmaker Derek 
Jarman is much more a literary and auditory achievement than a visual 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the broadcast premiere of "Derek Jarman's Blue," part of KCET's 
"Independent Eye" experimental film and video series, is totally devoid of 
images. Instead of pictures, the entire 75-minute film is an unaltering, 
monochromatic blue screen accompanied by voices, sounds and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? Rather remarkably, however, Jarman (acclaimed for such films as 
"Caravaggio" and "The Last of England") carries the viewer on a harrowing, 
personal journey of a man dying from AIDS and going blind. The autobiographical 
odyssey is a phantasmagoria, richly embellished by composer Simon Fisher 
Turner's score. 
</P>
<P>
 Coursing through Jarman's half dream, half nightmare is the pervasive "blue." 
Like the screen, blue becomes the texture and mirror of the filmmaker's loss of 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the work explodes our very idea of what film is. (Not 
coincidentally, the production will be simulcast in stereo on KPFK-FM.) But, 
while it's essentially a listening experience of a human body falling apart, a 
searing, raw, lyrical mediation into death, it's also undeniable that the deep 
blue screen creates a hallucinatory effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Aural imagery dances madly and not so madly: "My life runs like sparks through 
the stubble . . . the blue heat haze of my heart . . . the virus rages fierce . 
. . evil slime in the yellow bile . . . thinking blind, becoming blind . . . 
seeking the fabulous blue of bliss." 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, in Jarman's last words, he goes to rest: "I place the delphinium 
-- blue -- upon your grave." 
</P>
<P>
 Crucially, none of this is maudlin or gloomy. Four different voices enfold you 
(John Quentin, Nigel Terry, Derek Jarman and Tilda Swinton). But keep your eye 
on the screen. Its blueness becomes your distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Derek Jarman's Blue" airs at 11 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and will be 
simulcast by KPFK-FM (90.7). RAY LOYND

 60 YEARS: He's interviewed every president from Hoover to Bush and, no, it's 
not Mike Wallace. It's George Putnam, who, since 1976, has been host of a talk 
show weekdays on KIEV in Glendale. Thursday, Putnam celebrated two milestones 
-- his 80th birthday and his 60th year in broadcasting. . . . His favorite 
interview? "Eleanor Roosevelt," Putnam said. "She had a lot of warmth for her 
fellow man."

 MORE MOVIES: Woodland Hills could become the next Westwood. After all, a new 
20-screen Pacific Theatres complex at Victory and Topanga is set to open in 
late 1995, and now comes word that Saks Fifth Avenue at the Promenade Mall has 
been sold to AMC Theaters. . . . The AMC purchase isn't great news for Pacific. 
"No business wants competition," said Dan Chernow, of Pacific Theatres. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT WELCOME: The graffiti scrawled across the famed Malibu wall said it all: 
"Vals Go Home." In the early days of surfing in the '60s, Westsider locals 
treated Valley beach-goers as trespassers. "The flattening of tires, the 
breaking of car windows -- it could get vicious," said Mark Richards (above), 
who grew up in North Hollywood. . . . But Valley surfers didn't run away. See 
Valley Life! Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 ON CUE: There's a new Hollywood Athletic Club, but unlike the more established 
one, you can actually get a table at the branch at CityWalk in Universal City 
without a long wait. And the atmosphere is different too. . . . "Over in 
Hollywood, it's the movie actor scene," said April Dion, a waitress. "Here, we 
get a lot of the Burbank studio people." See Valley Life! Page 35.

 END OF AN ERA: Jack Sherwin certainly milked his career for everything he 
could. But today, after 32 years of delivering dairy products to Valley 
residents, Sherwin is retiring (B1). . . . He's seen many changes in the milk 
business, and the household. "You don't see much of those pretty women in 
negligees answering the door," he said. Michael Arkush

 ORANGE RAWHIDE: If you think freeway traffic is bad, try Fairview Road in 
Costa Mesa this morning. You'll find yourself behind 250 head of cattle on 
their way to the Orange County Fair. Fairview will be closed between Adams 
Avenue and Fair Drive between 9:30 and 10:30 as the cattle make their way from 
Costa Mesa High School to the fairgrounds. Guest riders include Orange County 
Sheriff Brad Gates, a veteran rider, and Costa Mesa Police Chief Dave Snowden 
-- who's allergic to horses. 
</P>
<P>
 SHUTTLE BUGS: You don't have to ride a horse to get to the fair -- or even 
drive a car. The free shuttle service from the Auto Club, at Fairview and South 
Coast Drive, has grown in popularity. . . . In 1990, 2,500 fairgoers took 
advantage of it. Last year, the number of shuttle riders was up to 6,500. The 
shuttle runs 6:30 p.m. to midnight Fridays during the fair, and noon to 
midnight Saturdays and Sundays.

 FUN WITH CLINTON: Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kansas) spoke at the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace on Wednesday night for an exclusive, 
$2,500-per-guest dinner tribute to the former President. . . . But Dole got in 
a few comments about the current President too: "I can't stay too late . . . I 
don't want to leave Mr. Clinton in Washington for very long. He may be 
suffering from jet lag and I don't want him to do anything while he is in that 
state."

 PROMOTIONAL SPLASH: The Splash predicts its largest crowd of the year at The 
Pond of Anaheim tonight, when it plays the Mexican team, the Monterrey La Raza. 
The indoor soccer game will be followed by a concert with the music group Los 
Tremendos. . . . The team has been heavily promoting the game on 
Spanish-language radio stations and with flyers in retail outlets with a strong 
Latino clientele. With tonight's seventh game, the Splash expect to surpass 
last year's entire 14-home game season attendance mark (26,779), when it was 
the L.A. United. Yo, Dogies

U.S. OUTLINES NEW QUAKE-AID PLAN FOR FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Quake-damaged businesses -- even those that have been denied loans by the 
Small Business Administration -- may be eligible to receive money and help with 
their debts under a $30-million federal program outlined Thursday by Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funds will fill a financial void created by the Northridge earthquake," 
Brown said. "Small businesses will be able to access the necessary capital that 
is at the center of their recovery and expansion plans."  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in Encino to a group of about 60 representatives of nonprofit 
organizations, lenders and community leaders, Brown presented the Competitive 
Communities Across America program, which he described as a non-traditional 
approach to assisting communities that redefines the role of the federal 
government in propelling local economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be creative and dynamic in our approach," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program, for communities in Ventura and Los Angeles counties that 
were heavily damaged in the Jan. 17 disaster, relies on the knowledge and 
skills of nonprofit community-based organizations, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, the Commerce Department's Economic Development 
Administration will select nonprofit organizations or "intermediaries," which 
will receive federal grants to establish revolving loan funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the specific needs and goals of their communities, the intermediaries 
will provide loans to selected businesses and help them restructure debts. The 
intermediaries will specifically try to help businesses that have the potential 
for growth and to create employment opportunities, but may be deeply in debt, 
including businesses that sought but were denied SBA quake assistance, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these companies have fallen between the cracks," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will also bring together public, private and nonprofit 
organizations to set priorities and strategies for their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very results-oriented approach that is very measurable and 
monitorable," Brown said. "It is . . . a new approach that acknowledges that 
sustained economic growth is not going to take place without the private 
sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Although businesses affected by the quake will benefit from the program, 
others will be eligible to apply as well, said Carol L. Hamilton, Brown's press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending the meeting included San Fernando Valley business leaders and 
executives of nonprofit groups as well as representatives of First A.M.E. 
Church, the Brotherhood Crusade, and other businesses and organizations from 
throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in east Ventura County, which suffered heavy damage in the quake, 
welcomed the secretary's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SBA is not generous in any way, shape or form," said Simi Valley Mayor 
Greg Stratton. "They've been very professional in the sense that they're only 
loaning to people that can pay it back." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, where the earthquake damaged one-third of the business district, 
City Manager Roy Payne said the loan plan "sounds like good news." 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said the SBA has been selective in doling out loans in Fillmore, Payne 
said, rejecting applications for loans that would improve stagnant cash flow, 
add new moneymaking elements to sluggish businesses or do just about anything 
other than let businesses reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to see what the terms and conditions are of the funding," Payne 
said. "But any assistance to businesses that will give more flexibility to them 
is certainly welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for nonprofit organizations to apply for the program is July 31 
and the selections will be made in August, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Economic Development Administration will hold community forums to 
introduce the programs to interested organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The launch of the Southern California program is part of a larger effort by 
the Commerce Department to promote competitive businesses in "economically 
distressed areas," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the rising economic tide doesn't lift all boats, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that as opportunity expands, everybody benefits," he 
said. "There are a lot of folks out there that don't have any boats."

SCR'S 'GOD'S HEART' PREMIERE CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory has canceled plans to present the world premiere of 
Craig Lucas' "God's Heart" next spring because Lucas will be working on the 
film of another of his plays, SCR officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 New York playwright Lucas and collaborator Norman Rene, who was to have 
directed "God's Heart" at SCR, will be tied up filming Lucas' "Reckless," which 
Rene will direct, SCR officials said. Lucas, who carries the title of SCR 
associate artist, penned two other major plays given their world premieres at 
SCR: "Three Postcards" and "Prelude to a Kiss." 
</P>
<P>
 To fill the gap, Moliere's frequently staged "The Misanthrope" has been added 
to the Mainstage season and a play to be announced will take the spring slot 
that had been reserved for "God's Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the Lucas premiere makes SCR's revival-heavy Mainstage season even 
heavier, with "The Misanthrope" joining Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named 
Desire," Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit" and Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard." 
</P>
<P>
 The only new work currently scheduled for the Mainstage is Orange County 
playwright Cecilia Fannon's "Green Icebergs," to be staged beginning in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescheduling "God's Heart" in the current season "was considered," according 
to a prepared statement the company issued Thursday. "But, due to filming and 
post-production (of 'Reckless,') and commitments by SCR to other artists," no 
alternative date could be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "a future production of "God's Heart" (is) a strong possibility," SCR 
producing-artistic director David Emmes said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "God's Heart" was to have been presented after its SCR premiere by New York's 
Lincoln Center Theater Group, which was instrumental in developing it. 
According to a Lincoln Center company spokeswoman, the theater now has "no 
plans" to present it. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, however, is "certainly under consideration" at the Trinity Repertory 
Company in Providence, R.I., a spokeswoman there said Thursday, although no 
final decision has been made. The play would be presented in the latter half of 
Trinity's 1994-95 season, which has not been finalized, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Misanthrope," scheduled for Jan. 6 to Feb. 12, will be directed by SCR 
associate artist David Chambers, who staged SCR's production of Moliere's "The 
Miser" two seasons ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 SCR's six-play Mainstage season opens Sept. 2 with "A Streetcar Named Desire."

A 'FLASHPOINT' OF INSPIRATION; GAY MEN'S CHORUS CELEBRATES EPIPHANY IN IRVINE 
CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer of '69. Woodstock was a celebration of mud, free love and inner space. 
The Apollo lunar landing was a celebration of moon rocks, free flight and outer 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 But before either of those watershed events, somewhere between inner and outer 
space, the summer had opened at New York City's Stonewall Inn. Not with mud, 
but with mudslinging and epithets. Not over free love, but over basic freedoms 
and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 It started in the wee hours of June 28 as a routine police raid of Stonewall, 
a gay bar. It became, as a result of the riots that followed, a metaphor for 
the modern gay-liberation movement. And it ultimately proved a giant step for 
gay men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years of gay activism since Stonewall are commemorated in composer 
Roger Bourland's new choral work, "Flashpoint/Stonewall." It will be sung 
Saturday by the combined Gay Men's Choruses of Los Angeles and San Diego at the 
Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1969, I was 15 years old, and I was just getting my first taste of the 
love-and-peace generation," Bourland recalled by phone recently from his West 
Hollywood residence. "I didn't know Stonewall was going on. But in retrospect, 
(it stands for) a refusal to go back into the closet. Every person, though we 
may not have lived through the historical Stonewall, we all have our own 
personal Stonewall to go through. Where we say, 'No, you cannot oppress me any 
longer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Flashpoint/Stonewall," with text by John Hall, was commissioned by a 
consortium of four choruses: The Seattle Men's Chorus and the Gay Men's 
Choruses of Los Angeles, New York City and Washington, D.C. Its first six 
performances, including two at Carnegie Hall, sold out; two more performances 
were given in Los Angeles last week. (Review, F16.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bourland, who also composed "Hidden Legacies," which addresses AIDS and was 
recorded by the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles, commented on the title of his 
new work. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Flashpoint' is the temperature that something bursts into flames," said 
Bourland, a professor of music at UCLA who received his Ph.D. in composition 
from Harvard. "That's really a beautiful image for many things. The night of 
Stonewall was also the night Judy Garland (a great favorite in the gay 
community) died, and that also made the temperature go up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision to 'come out' is usually brought about by an event that erupts 
in a flash point -- a flash point of anger or a flash point of epiphany," he 
said. "Now this sounds gay-specific, but it can transcend that. If you're 400 
pounds, for instance, but you love yourself, you can say, 'Damn it, this is the 
way I am.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Realizing that you are OK, that you are good the way you are, that is an 
epiphany," he continued. "Seeing an older gay person do something that is truly 
inspired can be an epiphany. I came out a long time ago, but getting involved 
with the gay choruses and 'Hidden Legacies,' seeing gay pride and power, was an 
incredible epiphany for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bourland counts among his awards the Koussevitsky Prize in Composition at 
Tanglewood, the John Knowles Paine Fellowship at Harvard and two National 
Endowment for the Arts grants. 
</P>
<P>
 He described his compositional style in "Flashpoint/Stonewall" as 
"post-modern, freely drawing from a variety of influences" and "very 
accessible. . . . There's even a country waltz in it," he said, his 18 
parakeets chirping in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 The work, scored for chorus, soloists, synthesizers, bass and drums, is also 
staged to a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dialogue between the spirit of Stonewall and the chorus of today," 
Bourland explained, "and dramatic things happen at the beginning." The 
performance includes an appearance by the Imperial Court of Los Angeles -- a 
name adopted by a group of drag queens. (Many major U.S. cities have Imperial 
Courts; the Imperial Court of New York appeared at the Carnegie Hall concerts.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, Bourland's composition apparently erupts in its own flash point: 
</P>
<P>
 When oppression is first on the menu  
</P>
<P>
 Then aggression becomes the only venue . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Aggression becomes the only  
</P>
<P>
 Flashpoint! Crashpoint!  
</P>
<P>
 Smashpoint! Bashpoint!  
</P>
<P>
 Clashpoint! Trashjoint! You get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closing words say we will be aggressive in fighting oppression," Bourland 
said. "That can (mean) writing congressmen, gay-pride marches, voting for 
candidates who are gay positive, but it does not mean bombing the White House. 
There are zillions of ways to express aggression . . . but (violence) is not 
what we had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it would bother so many people, but some people were very 
uncomfortable with the word aggression," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Seattle Men's Chorus) didn't like it, and they put it in past tense, 
referring only to the historical Stonewall. They felt it was too in-your-face. 
Some people in New York also thought it was too radical. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is," he added. "Don't plan on putting us back in the closet because we're 
not going." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles, joined by the Gay Men's Chorus of San 
Diego, performs Roger Bourland's "Flashpoint/Stonewall" and other works

THE AUTEUR WHO COINED THE WORD; COMMENTARY: A JEAN RENOIR EXPERT SAYS UCLA'S 
RETROSPECTIVE ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER AGE-OLD QUESTIONS ABOUT ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Long before any director with the right agent could get his name in a special 
box on the billboard, Jean Renoir was considered to be one of a handful of 
filmmakers whose artistic stamp could be found everywhere in their work. Renoir 
himself called such directors auteurs , directors who wrote their own scripts. 
But the term was later expanded to identify those directors whose personal 
vision could overcome the fragmentations of a collaborative art. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the status of the auteur theory as a way of determining cinematic 
value, the passionate commitment to the work of individual directors argued in 
the 1950s by Andre Bazin and such critics-into-filmmakers as Francois Truffaut 
and Jean-Luc Godard helped create an argument for the importance of film as a 
major art form based on the existence of major artists. 
</P>
<P>
 In that argument Renoir's films were central. A new postwar film audience was 
awakening to the work of Truffaut, Goddard, Antonioni, Rossellini, Fellini and 
Bergman, and it was Renoir's "La Grande Illusion" (1937) and "La Regle de Jeu" 
("The Rules of the Game," 1939) that first stirred a good part of that audience 
to believe that there was a particularly cinematic complexity of ideas, 
performances and imagery worth comparing to the established arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Time was that anyone living in a big city or college town could get an 
education in film history by just going to the local film society or repertory 
theater. Now, only in retrospectives like one that begins at UCLA today do we 
get a chance to ask those old questions about the shape of a director's career 
and the value of individual works: What lasts? What do we still watch with 
pleasure, interest and even illumination? 
</P>
<P>
 Renoir was born in 1894, the second son of Impressionist painter 
Pierre-Auguste Renoir. His older brother Pierre became an actor and appears in 
Jean's "La Nuit du Carrefour" (1932) as Simenon's Inspector Maigret, in "Madame 
Bovary" (1934) as Charles Bovary and in "La Marseillaise" (1938) as Louis XVI. 
Pierre's son Claude worked as a cinematographer on several of Jean's films from 
the mid-1930s onward.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's centenaire focuses on Renoir's career to 1939, when the filmmaker 
immigrated to the United States, settling in Beverly Hills and making five more 
films during World War II. A film enthusiast whose childhood interest had been 
reawakened by an enforced period of recuperation from a war wound, Renoir in 
the early 1920s produced and wrote the script for "Catherine" (1924), starring 
his wife, Catherine Hessling, who had been one of his father's models. It was 
directed by Albert Dieudonne, later the star of Abel Gance's epic "Napoleon" 
(1927). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Renoir was disappointed with what Dieudonne had done. He gave up a career 
as a ceramicist and sold several of his father's paintings to finance his first 
feature, "La Fille de l'Eau" (1924), the story of a young girl (again played by 
Hessling) who lives on a barge with her brutal uncle. (The only painting he 
kept was a large one depicting himself dressed as a hunter. It now hangs in the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art.) 
</P>
<P>
 Between "La Fille de l'Eau" and "Rules of the Game," Renoir made 18 features 
and several shorter films, including the "long shorts" "La Petite Marchande aux 
Allumettes" ("The Little Match Girl," 1928), "On Purge Bebe" (1931) and "Partie 
de Campagne" ("A Day in the Country," 1936, completed in 1946). With the 
exception of "Rules of the Game" and "Grande Illusion," the films of this 
period are rarely shown, and the UCLA programmers have included virtually 
everything Renoir made, with the exception of the lost feature "Marguita" and 
the lost short "Le Petit Chaperon Rouge" ("Little Red Riding Hood"). 
</P>
<P>
 "On Purge Bebe" and "Chotard et Cie" (1933) are being shown for the first time 
in the United States, and many of the other films are being shown in Renoir's 
own copies, willed to UCLA. These include "Le Tournoi" (1929), a story of 
romance and politics set in the 16th-Century France of Catherine de Medicis, 
which was previously thought to exist only in a 10-minute fragment. 
</P>
<P>
 The tremendous variety of Renoir's work in the 1920s and 1930s seems amazing 
today when a director is considered remarkably talented if he or she can work 
in two genres, and a genius if in three. Throughout his career Renoir was 
constantly experimenting with genres and styles, often within the same film. 
Equally fascinated by stylized sets and location shooting, he freely mingled 
artifice and realism in both his plots and his images. 
</P>
<P>
 The general impression of the benevolence of Renoir's films may be due to 
associating them with the dappled, rosy nudes of his father's paintings. But 
there is little here of Pierre-Auguste Renoir's frequent blandness and 
prettification. These films of the 1920s and 1930s, in both subject matter and 
pictorial style, more resemble the harsh urban interiors of Toulouse-Lautrec or 
the shimmering uncertainties of Monet's gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Fille de l'Eau" marks the beginning of a silent-film career that included 
adaptations of Zola's "Nana" (also starring Hessling), "Le Tournoi" and "Le 
Bled," an innocently imperialist paean to the settlement of Algeria. By the end 
of the '20s, however, these films in the lavish silent style (perhaps in 
emulation of his early idol Erich von Stroheim) had given Renoir a reputation 
for being an expensive filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1931 with "On Purge Bebe," an adaptation of a Feydeau farce, Renoir became 
one of the few French directors to make the silent-to-sound transition by 
proving he could make a film cheaply and quickly (five weeks from scriptwriting 
to breaking even), while outrageously exploiting the new technology (the first 
toilet flushing on a soundtrack). 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his commitment to the auteur director, Renoir was equally fascinated 
with the energy and movement of performers, and his camera itself increasingly 
plays the role of an observer within the scene rather than a God-like eye above 
it, even in epic works like "Le Tournoi." 
</P>
<P>
 He also acts, notably in "Rules of the Game," and his films are filled with 
memorable faces and presences: Hessling in his early films; Valentine Tessler 
in "Madame Bovary"; Charles Blavette in "Toni" (1935); Jean Gabin in "Grande 
Illusion," "The Lower Depths" and "La Bete Humaine" (1938); Marcel Dalio in 
"Grande Illusion" and "Rules of the Game" and, perhaps most strikingly, Michel 
Simon in "Boudu Saved From Drowning" (1932), which Renoir called "a kind of 
free exercise around an actor," and on which Paul Mazursky based "Down and Out 
in Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these films deal with people trapped by their own passions. "La 
Chienne" (1931), starring Simon as a meek clerk who kills his mistress, is a 
forerunner of the stories of betrayal that would preoccupy film noir 15 years 
later. "La Nuit du Carrefour" (1932) exploits even more the shadows, mists and 
water-slick streets of a detective thriller. "Toni's" story of murder and 
desire, set among Italian laborers in the south of France, presages Italian 
neorealism and further underlines this strongly fatalistic streak, as does 
Renoir's adaptation of Zola's "La Bete Humaine." 
</P>
<P>
 Both "La Bete" and "La Chienne" were later remade by Fritz Lang as "Human 
Desire" (1954) and "Scarlet Street" (1945). Similarly, Renoir's version of 
Gorki's "The Lower Depths" (1936) might be compared to Akira Kurosawa's (1957) 
-- rare opportunities to see how two great directors treat the same material. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in the films shadowed by an encroaching sense of doom, there is a 
vein of optimism about what the world would be like if other choices were 
possible. One of the most intriguing of Renoir's films of the 1930s, "The Crime 
of M. Lange" (1935), bears his name not only as director but also as a member 
of a radical culture collective, the Groups Octobre. The compatriots behind the 
camera are mirrored in the story of a publishing house for which Lange writes 
tales about a hero named Arizona Jim and an American West he has never seen. 
When the conniving publisher seems to have died in a train wreck, the workers 
take over and become tremendously successful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the kind of creative prescience that Renoir shows in many other films of 
the period, Lange is an early version of the kind of the sometimes sardonic, 
sometimes affectionate view of popular culture that would inspire the directors 
of the New Wave. As in "La Vie est a Nous" (1936), a "March of Time"-like 
fiction documentary made as an anti-fascist recruiting film for the French 
Communist Party, Lange asserted the possibility of a collective moral response 
that still respected individual eccentricity and difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in "La Marseillaise" (1938), Renoir views the French Revolution 
through its most famous song, as it evolves from a popular folk tune to become 
the national anthem. With comparable revolutionary optimism about film 
economics, the film was financed by two-franc contributions by members of the 
CGT, the French trade union. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's showings conclude with "Rules of the Game," which opened in 1939 to 
ferocious attacks by French fascist groups. Re-editing was fruitless, and the 
film was later banned by the Vichy regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Renoir's flight from Europe to America occurred not long after the release of 
"Rules of the Game," and his later films have their own appeal. But the work of 
few directors of any period have the continuity and variety as Renoir's from 
1924 to 1939, and fewer still would reward anything like a complete submersion 
in the sun and shadow, the complex warmth of the world he makes entirely his 
own.

FOX'S PROGRAMMING CHIEF DEFENDS FALL PLANS, MOVES; TELEVISION: THE NETWORK'S 
SANDY GRUSHOW COMES UNDER CRITICISM FOR SENSATIONAL TRUE-CRIME MOVIES AND 
SWITCHING 'MELROSE PLACE' TO THE SO-CALLED 'FAMILY HOUR.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fox Entertainment Chairman Sandy Grushow on Thursday defended the network's 
plan for a "quickie" movie on the murder case involving football legend O.J. 
Simpson, saying Fox was committed to presenting "a good, responsible film." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to questions during a gathering of national television writers at 
the Television Critics Assn. summer press tour at the Universal Hilton, Grushow 
insisted that the movie would not take a position on the guilt or innocence of 
Simpson in the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend 
Ronald Lyle Goldman outside her Brentwood condominium last month. He said the 
film would most likely focus on Simpson's life prior to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow insisted that the film is still only tentative. "Our responsibility as 
a broadcaster in putting something like this on is significant, and that's why 
we want to see a script first," he said. "We don't have a 'go' picture yet, and 
we won't until we get a script." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that a director, Steve Friedman, has already been set for 
the project, which is currently being written by Steve Harigan. He also said 
that Fox hopes to broadcast the film in the late summer or early fall, which 
would be near the anticipated mid-September start date for Simpson's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the public is fascinated with this case," he said in explaining the 
network's haste to put the movie on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, no other networks have announced plans for a Simpson-related film. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson film is one of several original movies on the "Fox Night at the 
Movies" schedule for Tuesday nights that will focus on sensational true-crime 
cases or tabloid-style biographies. Other titles include "The True Story of the 
Boston Strangler," "Madonna: The Early Years," an unauthorized story on the 
controversial superstar, and a miniseries about the romantic entanglements of 
actress Mia Farrow, "Mia: Child of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the planned films mark a departure from the network's earlier position 
of producing original movies that would differ in tone and content from 
traditional "ripped from the headlines" movies-of-the-week on ABC, CBS and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow said, "There was a real hole in that theory" to do different types of 
films, and "we got tired of getting 5 shares with movies like 'Based on an 
Untrue Story,' " which was a parody of network TV movies. He said Fox had 
better success last season with movies such as one based on the Menendez murder 
case, "so we're willing to take a few more shots" in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox programming chief also defended the network's decision to move the 
steamy soap opera "Melrose Place" this fall from Wednesdays at 9 p.m. to 
Mondays at 8 p.m., during the so-called "family hour." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sensitive to the appropriateness of putting the show on at that 
time," Grushow said. "It was not a decision that was made capriciously. It's 
not a traditional family show, but nor is it anti-social. People who tune it in 
know what they're going to get. The themes explored in 'Melrose Place' can be 
found in soap operas that come on during the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow said that NBC's decision last season to air its adult-oriented 
situation comedy "Mad About You" at 8 p.m. Thursday did not hurt or affect that 
show's tone, and he expected the same result with "Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not have moved the show if we thought it would impact it 
creatively," he said, adding that the program would not carry an advisory 
calling for parental discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further discussion of "Melrose Place," several critics criticized the 
cutaway from a kiss between two gay men in the season finale, arguing that the 
show's gay male character was not allowed to have a sex life while the rest of 
the characters hop in and out of bed with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow said that there was too much advertiser opposition to the kiss, and 
that Fox would have lost up to $1 million if it had aired the kiss as it was 
filmed: "The bottom line is that we're a business. It's show business, but 
still a business, and we just couldn't afford to take that kind of financial 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Grushow also addressed criticism that the network had canceled several shows 
featuring African Americans, including "South Central," "Roc," "In Living 
Color" and "Bakersfield P.D." He said Fox in its seven-year history had put on 
more shows revolving around African Americans than all the other networks 
combined. He added that Fox was taking the unusual step of presenting two new 
hourlong dramas starring blacks: "New York Undercover" and "M.A.N.T.I.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox will begin rolling out its new shows with the premiere of "M.A.N.T.I.S." 
on Aug. 26, and the entire Fox schedule of new and returning series will 
premiere by Sept. 16 in advance of the fall schedules of ABC, NBC and CBS.

MUSEUM LAUNCHES EXPANSION; ART: SAN DIEGO'S MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART WILL ADD 
GALLERY SPACE AND A CAFE AS WELL AS RENOVATE EXISTING SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After a decade of planning and fund-raising, work is finally set to begin on 
the most ambitious renovation and expansion project in the 53-year history of 
the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time coming," said museum director Hugh M. Davies just 
moments before Thursday's symbolic groundbreaking at the museum on Prospect 
Street in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 When the $8.3-million project is finished in early 1996, the museum will enjoy 
an additional 4,500 square feet of gallery space. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a cafe is being added, the museum bookstore expanded, air-conditioning 
and acoustical improvements are being made to the 499-seat Sherwood Auditorium, 
and a new facade will recall the 1916-vintage home of philanthropist Ellen 
Browning Scripps that was the original museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident that this building will become a landmark in San Diego and a 
magnet for architectural aficionados," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects for the project are Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates of 
Philadelphia, one of the world's leading architectural design and planning 
firms. Robert Venturi has taught at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, 
received the Rome Prize in architecture, and in 1991 received architecture's 
highest international honor, the Pritzker Architecture Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the project, Venturi told reporters Thursday, is to make the 
museum compatible with the streets of La Jolla to the east and the ocean vistas 
to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building must be a background for the art," he said, "and it must not 
intrude on the art." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of La Jolla's 30-foot height limit, the museum is blocked from adding 
stories and will instead expand horizontally. The original museum was the work 
of architect Irving Gill, a seminal figure in California architecture whose 
works dot San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's current 10,500 square feet of gallery space is closed for the 
duration of construction, although a 6,000-square-foot satellite facility in 
downtown San Diego remains open. The downtown center is now hosting a show by 
British sculptor David Nash. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, formerly the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, juggles a 
permanent collection of 3,000 works of art with traveling shows and 
exhibitions, as well as performance art, music and literary events. 
</P>
<P>
 When the museum reopens, the first show will feature the works of the late Los 
Angeles artist John Altoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion, said associate director Charles E. Castle, "will allow our 
patrons to continue to get to know their old friends in our permanent 
collection over the years, plus continue to be exposed to new artists." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies, who became director in 1983, said the project was slowed by the 
intricacies of getting building permits in San Diego and also the difficulty of 
fund-raising in a slow economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion and renovation is part of an overall $10.5-million capital 
campaign that also includes establishing a permanent facility in downtown San 
Diego. The fund- raising effort is within 10% of the goal, Davies said.

R&B'S BRENDA HOLLOWAY STILL HAS A SONG TO SING; POP MUSIC: AS A PROMISING 
MOTOWN STAR IN THE 1960S, SHE OPENED FOR THE BEATLES. THEN SHE QUIT IN '69. NOW 
SHE'S ON THE COMEBACK TRAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Imagine touring with the Beatles , which was like . . . like . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Words finally failed R&B singer Brenda Holloway, who for five minutes had been 
gushing nonstop about the golden moment of her career -- serving as an opening 
act on the Fab Four's first stadium U.S. tour in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway started reminiscing as she tried to explain why she's eager to get 
back into a business she abandoned in 1969 when she was a promising Motown star 
who'd had some hit singles, including "Every Little Bit Hurts" and "When I'm 
Gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon sun was blazing as she sat by the pool at a friend's apartment 
in Culver City, but she didn't seem to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a private plane," she said dreamily, resuming her Beatles tales. "I 
remember the pillow fights with Ringo and the great food -- we had our own 
chef. Once you've done all that, it never gets out of your system. It's been in 
the back of my mind all these years. I've just got to try the business again." 
</P>
<P>
 But playing an oldies show at Steven's Steak House in Commerce, which Holloway 
is doing Sunday, isn't quite like opening for the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm on a totally different level now," said Holloway, smiling somewhat 
grimly, as the giddiness generated by those fond memories fades. "I may be 
crazy, but I've got to try it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not going to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she's 48, with four daughters between ages 16 and 22, and also two 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sung a lot of lullabies in the past 20 years, but that's about the 
extent of my singing," chuckled Holloway, who seems mostly upbeat about her 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In her heyday, she was a budding star at Motown, signing in 1963 after leaving 
Jordan High in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Beatles tour and some medium-sized hits, Holloway was never really 
a huge star. Although fairly well-known, she was never in a class with Motown 
stars Diana Ross and Gladys Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 That's partly why she bailed out on Motown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I never got access to the quality songs or got the attention from the 
label I needed to really make it big," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually her biggest success was as a songwriter. She co-wrote "You've Made Me 
So Very Happy," which was a multimillion seller for Blood, Sweat & Tears in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides frustration over her recording career, Holloway says the use of 
prescription drugs also convinced her to leave the pop world. "It was a big 
part of the business then," she said. "I was starting to abuse prescription 
drugs and that scared me." 
</P>
<P>
 So Holloway sought refuge in religion for the next 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hiding out in the church," she said. "I married a minister, had four 
daughters, did some preaching myself and stopped singing." 
</P>
<P>
 She divorced in 1990 and married again -- to a wealthy man who was in his 90s. 
"It was embarrassing at times because people thought I was his granddaughter 
instead of his wife," she said. "But I was devoted to him. He took every second 
I had." 
</P>
<P>
 But after he died in 1992, she had plenty of time to do whatever she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done a few oldies dates and I'll do some more," she explained in a very 
firm, positive manner. "I'm going to do some work on a gospel album Bobby 
Womack is recording. And I'm going to try to get my own record deal. . . . I 
can still sing -- as well as a lot of singers out there. I'm a little older, 
but there's still plenty of life in me."

NAKED SOUL TO REST IN PEACE AFTER O.C. GIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Naked Soul is ending its five-year run tonight with a farewell concert at Our 
House in its hometown of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, the band released an album and an EP for Scotti Bros. 
Records and went on several national tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Naked Soul's leader, Mike Conley, has presided over shifting lineups since 
starting the band in 1989, including a complete revamping of the band last 
fall. Conley said Tuesday that guitarist Bill Latas and drummer Shawn Poores 
have decided to return to their hometown of Kansas City, Mo. Rather than 
continue under the name Naked Soul, Conley and bassist Alec Porter are 
considering starting a new band, tentatively called Sugarfix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could keep (Naked Soul) going if I wanted, but I like to keep moving on," 
said Conley, who has been part of the Orange County rock scene since 1980, when 
he moved here from Las Vegas with punk band MIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to toy around with a few different ideas I have, maybe a little 
more pop than we've been doing on the one hand, and maybe a little more extreme 
and heavy on the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try something that they can't pin that ugly 'W' word on me 
anymore: the Westerberg word," Conley added with a chuckle, alluding to the 
frequent comparisons drawn between his style with Naked Soul, and Paul 
Westerberg's with the Replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said that he and Porter plan to record some new songs next month with 
Fluf's drummer, Miles Gillett. If those demos lead to a record deal, they will 
audition for a full-time drummer and go on from there. Otherwise, Conley said, 
"I'll just kind of coast for a while. It's been a busy year." 
</P>
<P>
 * Naked Soul, the Iron Ons, the Get Backs and Skin Bus play tonight at Our 
House, 720 W. 19th St., Costa Mesa. 9 p.m. $4. (714) 650-8960.

 When Lara Teeter says he has "some really hot women" for Fullerton Civic Light 
Opera's upcoming revival of "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," he's not 
pandering so much as striking a blow for freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Teeter, a prize-winning Broadway performer who is directing the show, has had 
to cut some of the vulgar words from the script because "the producers are 
worried they're going to get letters about the language." Therefore, he adds, 
"I intend to make sure that the letters they get are about the women." 
</P>
<P>
 Having appeared in the original Broadway production, the 39-year-old director 
has a special affection for "Best Little Whorehouse." He maintains that Larry 
King, who co-wrote the script with Peter Masterson, "would have a fit" if he 
knew about the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he would say, 'If you don't like the words, don't do the show,' " 
Teeter asserts. "Part of me feels that way, too. So I'm making the women really 
sexy. If I can't have one, I'll have the other. I'm going to give the audience 
something to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Duncan, the light opera's co-producer and artistic director, justifies 
toning down the language for this production, which will run tonight through 
July 31 in Fullerton's Plummer Auditorium, strictly as a concession to patrons 
whose conservative sensibilities might be offended by four-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what our audience is like here," she said. "We didn't change any of 
the four-letter words in 'A Chorus Line,' and we got bombarded. We had all 
kinds of hate mail. We have people who thought 'Zorba' was too sexy. They 
thought John Raitt (who played Zorba) was 'fornicating' on stage with an old 
lady. I received a complaint about 'live sex' on stage in 'Oklahoma.' Live sex? 
 
</P>
<P>
 "We may get tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail for this show." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently they're willing to take their lumps over some saucy costuming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because the troupe presumed that many of its roughly 8,000 subscribers would 
have scant tolerance for risque material, it advertised "Best Little 
Whorehouse" in a season brochure as "adult entertainment" and made the 
production an optional offering "for the brave and daring." 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the season ticket-holders chose not to subscribe to the show, 
which certainly bears out the accuracy of that presumption. But it also means 
the two-thirds who did subscribe are a self-selected group willing to take 
their chances on being offended. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Best Little Whorehouse" has been "one of the top 10 shows our 
audience would like to see ever since we started balloting years ago," Duncan 
said. "And last year it was third on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Why, given the support of such a solid majority, is the company running 
scared? Because the conservative minority is not just vocal in its opposition 
to fare it dislikes; it is also a loyal audience for shows it likes, going back 
a long way with the light opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a small shift in audience loyalty is all it takes to make the 
difference between success and failure at the box office, Duncan and her 
co-producer husband, Griff, maintain they can't afford to alienate the 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, their programming choices tend to take the path of least 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Teeter understands all that but intends to challenge the audience anyway. Even 
without four-letter words, he notes, this revival of "Whorehouse" will make its 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked closely with costume designer Mela Hoyt-Heydon for the look of the 
show and took ideas from Playboy and Vargas, the master of sultry drawings of 
partially clad women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mela really gave me what I want," Teeter said. "I want to see some of those 
bodies. I want to see those long legs and still make it Texas fun. We stayed 
true to the period, bell-bottoms and halter tops, that kind of thing. But we 
did a little Vargas. We did a little bit of lingerie, a little bit of leather. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a Playboy edition that came out with all these girls in chaps and 
Texas wear. We picked out certain things that were really delicious-looking. 
And we put some girls up there who look delicious. There's one girl who likes 
leather. I sort of stepped on the line with her. But for me, that's where the 
focus is in this production." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which originated off-Broadway in 1978 and ran for more than 1,500 
performances on Broadway, is based on a real incident in the history of a 
famous Texas brothel dubbed the Chicken Ranch (because Depression-era customers 
were allowed to pay with poultry). 
</P>
<P>
 Dating back to the 1840s, the Chicken Ranch was an accepted institution 
catering to clients from all walks of life. In 1973, however, a television 
preacher went on a crusade against it with his vigilante-style "Watch Dogs" and 
managed to close it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chicken Ranch was a very respectable place," Teeter said. "There was no 
alcohol allowed. They had old-fashioned values. It was a very clean joint, so 
to speak. But you can't get around the fact that it was a whorehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you get from the show is an inside look at these girls and their dreams. 
You get a real cross-section of ethics and morals, what's right and what's 
wrong. It succeeds in showing that whores are people, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teeter, a native Oklahoman and the son of a Methodist minister, landed his 
first job on Broadway in the dance chorus of "Best Little Whorehouse" as one of 
the Aggie football players serviced by the Chicken Ranch. (He describes himself 
as an eccentric dancer who can act and sing.) 
</P>
<P>
 Several seasons later, he won an Outer Circle Critics Award and a Tony Award 
nomination as best featured player in a musical for his performance in a George 
Abbott revival of "On Your Toes." (Teeter re-created the role of Junior Dolan, 
which was originated by Ray Bolger in 1936.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel blessed that I got to work for Mr. Abbott on that show," he said, 
referring to the 107-year-old director-producer-writer. "He was 97 years old 
when he directed me, and he had more energy than everybody in the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Teeter, who now teaches musical theater at Cal State Fullerton, has starred 
for the Los Angeles Opera Company as Will Parker in "Oklahoma" and has played a 
variety of key roles for New York City Opera (Herman in "The Most Happy Fella" 
and Silas Slick in "Naughty Marietta"). 
</P>
<P>
 Though Teeter won't be performing in Fullerton's "Best Little Whorehouse," he 
predicts that the big Aggie number, which brought down the house on Broadway 
and earned Tommy Tune a Tony for choreography, will do it again in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're restaging his original choreography for that," Teeter said. "It's a 
guaranteed show-stopper." 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Barnett of "Knots Landing" fame, who starred on Broadway in "Nine," 
will play Miss Mona, the ranch's madam. Darrell Sandeen, who also has major 
Broadway and television credits, will play Sheriff Dodd. And B. W. Wiff, last 
seen with the light opera company as Pappy Finn in "Big River," will play 
"Watchdog" Thorpe, the televangelist preacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I learned from Tommy Tune is to surround yourself with people who 
are better than you are," Teeter said. "I've got some really hot women in this 
show. That's what I wanted, and that's what I've got." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fullerton Civic Light Opera's "The Best Little Whorehouse" runs today 
through July 31 at Plummer Auditorium, 220 E. Chapman Ave, Fullerton. $13-$26.

COLOSIO SLAYING CASE STILL OPEN; PROSECUTOR QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The special prosecutor investigating the assassination of ruling party 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio resigned Thursday after his 
findings caused an uproar, and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said the 
case will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 Supreme Court Justice Miguel Montes Garcia resigned two days after announcing 
he had concluded that a 23-year-old factory worker acted alone in committing 
the murder. His formal report had been expected to close the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, Salinas accepted Montes' resignation and named law professor 
Olga Islas to replace him as special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case is not closed nor is the investigation concluded," Salinas said in a 
press statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Montes, who is a career politician, Islas' specialty is practicing and 
teaching law. Salinas also named a panel of five distinguished legal experts to 
review the investigation and said Montes' report would be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes' conclusion that Colosio was not the victim of a conspiracy raised 
widespread accusations that the government was sweeping the investigation under 
the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio was the leading candidate to win the Aug. 21 presidential election. 
His murder March 23 at the end of a Tijuana campaign rally has contributed to 
an atmosphere of political instability in a country already shaken by a Jan. 1 
Indian uprising in the southern state of Chiapas and rising violence related to 
drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, officials had pursued an investigation of a murder conspiracy 
involving at least six men. Three of the accused are currently in jail, 
awaiting trial on allegations that they manipulated the crowd and distracted 
bodyguards at the campaign rally, allowing factory worker Mario Aburto Martinez 
to get close enough to Colosio to fatally shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of videotapes were the main evidence for that theory. Prosecutors 
have not interviewed members of Aburto's family, now living in Los Angeles, who 
say he may have been influenced by radical political groups.  
</P>
<P>
 Conspiracy theories have put the blame on everyone from drug traffickers to 
malcontents within Colosio's own party to an alliance between the two groups. 
The theories were strengthened in the public mind by the gangland-style murder 
of the Tijuana police chief, who had indicated he suspected a plot to kill 
Colosio.  
</P>
<P>
 Montes indicated last month that he was leaning toward a lone gunman theory. 
But his announcement Tuesday that he saw no evidence of a conspiracy provoked 
outrage.  
</P>
<P>
 Juan Velazquez, a lawyer for Colosio's widow, called Montes' report 
"ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders and listeners calling in to Thursday morning radio talk shows 
demanded a new investigation. Members of Colosio's Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, led by new candidate Ernesto Zedillo, who was Colosio's campaign 
manager, called for the party to create its own commission to investigate the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes, in a two-page letter of resignation, stated: "In the current 
circumstances, I think the investigation would benefit if the upcoming work was 
not coordinated by me." Salinas immediately accepted the resignation and 
commended Montes for assembling an excellent team of investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio offended all Mexicans," Salinas said. "The 
government is committed to get to the bottom of it."

PASSIVE CARE OF EAR FLUID IN CHILDREN OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children with persistent fluid build-up in their ears -- an extremely common 
condition that can lead to chronic infections and temporary hearing loss -- 
first should be treated with "watchful waiting," rather than more aggressive 
treatments such as antibiotics or surgery, a federal panel said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Otitis media with effusion often can disappear by itself and should not be 
treated until it has lasted at least three months, said a committee of outside 
experts convened by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, a part of 
the U.S. Public Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
 This recommendation "should be good news for parents," said Dr. Philip R. Lee, 
assistant secretary for health. The agency's recommendations are widely 
disseminated and considered the standard of care for the nation's physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 After common viral infections -- such as colds -- and well-baby visits, ear 
problems in young children are the most frequent reason for trips to the 
pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, there were 24.5 million pediatrician visits for all types of ear 
problems, and the panel estimated that otitis media with effusion accounted for 
as much as 35% of them, or up to 8.5 million visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Pediatric ear problems also add at least $2 billion to the nation's annual 
health care bill, a figure that includes visits to doctors, surgery, drugs and 
diagnostic tests associated with hearing and speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Ear fluid accumulation is not life-threatening, nor does it hurt, but it can 
become extremely painful when infections develop, and -- because it so often 
muffles hearing -- can affect speech and language development in children 
between the ages of 1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three months is a short period of time but it is often long enough to clear 
up the condition," said Dr. Alfred O. Berg, a professor of family medicine at 
the University of Washington in Seattle, co-chairman of the panel. "With most 
of the children I see with this condition in my practice, in two or three 
months, it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Otitis media with effusion, also known as "glue ear," is characterized by the 
presence of watery or mucous-like fluid behind the eardrum, which separates the 
outer ear from the middle ear. 
</P>
<P>
 It differs from acute otitis media -- the common ear infection -- because 
there are no obvious symptoms, such as a bulging ear drum, pain or fever. But 
"glue ear" often leads to infections. 
</P>
<P>
 Ear infections are caused by bacteria that migrate to the middle ear -- often 
as secondary infections to colds -- and, when fluid is present, find the dark, 
warm and moist environment an ideal place to breed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluid is produced in all of the body's membranes -- including those in the 
middle ear -- and usually is naturally reabsorbed within the body. Normally, 
the middle ear is filled with air because fluid produced there drains down 
through the Eustachian tube, a tiny channel that connects the middle ear to the 
back of the throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts believe that otitis media with effusion occurs frequently in 
children because their Eustachian tubes tend to be shorter, narrower and more 
horizontal than those of adults, and fluid fails to drain properly. Most 
children outgrow the condition by the age of 6, or by the onset of puberty. 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines recommend that children undergo a hearing evaluation if the 
condition has not cleared after three months. If tests indicate a 
mild-to-moderate hearing loss in both ears, physicians should consider 
antibiotics -- which helps eliminate the fluid in a small number of children -- 
or surgery, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the condition continue for four to six months, with hearing loss, the 
preferred treatment is surgery, the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The surgical procedure, known as myringotomy, lances the eardrum to drain the 
fluid. At the same time, the surgeon inserts tympanostomy tubes in each 
eardrum. The tiny tubes provide ventilation -- enabling air to reach the middle 
ear -- thus preventing fluid from accumulating. 
</P>
<P>
 Such treatments, however, are not without risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Antibiotics can cause side effects, such as gastrointestinal problems or skin 
rashes, and can contribute to the growth of antibiotic-resistant strains of 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgery, which takes only about 20 minutes, must be performed under 
general anesthesia because the child must remain absolutely still. Also, the 
tubes naturally work their way out of the eardrum, usually within a year, and 
may have to be replaced -- requiring repeat surgery -- if the child has not 
outgrown the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the tubes remain in the eardrum, the ears must be kept dry, since 
water carries bacteria and can cause further infections if it enters the middle 
ear through the opening in the tubes. Thus, children with ear tubes must always 
wear earplugs or other protection when bathing or swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in rare instances, the procedure can result in permanent scarring of 
the eardrum. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel recommended against other types of surgeries -- removal of tonsils 
or adenoids -- to cure the condition. It also recommended against the use of 
steroids, antihistamines or decongestants.

IT'S BARS VS. BOOZE PATROL IN WORLD CUP SIDE MATCH; PASADENA: STATE CRACKS DOWN 
ON SCOFFLAWS, BUT SOME OWNERS CLAIM HARD-NOSED TACTICS. MOST PUBS OBEY THE 
RULES. 
</P>

<P>
 Forget the Rose Bowl -- the real drama during the World Cup is in the bars. 
Take Pasadena's Old Town Pub, mere blocks from the soccer venue, where a scene 
unfolded late one night right out of an episode of "Cops." 
</P>
<P>
 A pitcher of beer changed hands at the bar and out of nowhere undercover 
agents with the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control swooped in -- 
handcuffing the man who ordered the beer, citing the bartender and leaving the 
bar full of confused soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think it was a major cocaine bust," complained bartender Terese 
Brasile, who was cited for serving alcohol to intoxicated patrons. "These young 
ABC guys were whispering and carrying on. They even seized the pitcher and 
glasses as evidence. It was like something out of a 'Naked Gun' movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Such tactics have made some Pasadena bar owners livid. They accuse the ABC of 
storming into their taverns, slapping handcuffs on patrons and dragging 
celebrants out through the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everybody is up in arms over the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an extremely proactive strategy," said Fran Neumann, executive director 
of Day One, a Pasadena-based alcohol and drug prevention group. "We want bar 
owners to manage alcohol better. They were warned that the ABC was coming in. 
The fact that the ABC is busting people means that there are people who deserve 
to be busted." 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of Old Town's watering holes have avoided ABC citations, but 
owners of those that have been cited are lashing out at the regulatory agency.  
</P>
<P>
 "They use storm trooper tactics and they come in yelling 'OK, there he is, the 
guy in the corner, get him, go, go, go,' " said Dennis Bukowski, a former Los 
Angeles police officer who owns the Wise Guys bar, a favorite hangout of 
Brazilian fans. "It's like the only training they got was watching cop shows on 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of the World Cup's Pasadena command center, the ABC has joined the 
local police, FBI, U.S. State Department and dozens of other agencies in a 
campaign to prevent soccer fans from turning fanatical. They have heard the 
criticism inside the bars but say they have a job to do. 
</P>
<P>
 On game days, the ABC has mobilized a good chunk of the entire region's 
investigative force in Old Town Pasadena -- as many as 20 undercover agents go 
barhopping on particularly active nights. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, nine establishments (out of a total of 54 alcohol licenses in the 
area) have been cited for everything from selling alcohol on the sidewalk to 
allowing dancing without a permit. Penalties can bring hefty fines, license 
suspensions or, in drastic cases, revocation of the license to sell alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of drunk patrons also have been arrested in Old Town since the World 
Cup began a month ago -- more than usual. The hooliganism that authorities 
feared has yet to materialize. But, as a precautionary measure, police closed 
all the bars about midnight Wednesday, when a celebration after Brazil's 
semifinal victory over Sweden flowed into the streets and showed no signs of 
letting up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our basic mission is to ensure that alcohol does not play a role in any 
large-scale disturbances in Old Town," said ABC spokesman Carl Falletta. 
</P>
<P>
 That means, he said, focusing on small problems before they escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Pasadena supports the ABC's crackdown. "It has been a totally 
well-balanced approach," said Ann Erdman, city public information officer. 
"There has been total cooperation between the ABC and the city of Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 But what authorities are calling preventive maintenance, some Pasadena bar 
owners are calling unnecessary tactics that are bad for business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're arresting people and treating them like felony suspects," said 
Bukowski of Wise Guys. "What about PR? You don't go dragging tourists off like 
that while the world is watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski said he organized about 25 Old Town bar owners to meet with ABC 
officials this month after agents moved in June 29 and issued a handful of 
citations to owners, bartenders and cocktail waitresses who allegedly sold 
drinks to intoxicated patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Matty, a supervising investigator for ABC, looked more like an ebullient 
camp counselor than a Rambo cop as she patrolled Old Town bars this week in 
denim shorts and ABC T-shirt. Strapped to her waist was a fanny pack holding a 
gun, handcuffs and small plastic vial used to store alcohol samples as 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 She was greeted warmly by bar owners as she made her rounds, although some 
grumbled about ABC tactics when Matty, a 13-year veteran, was not around. 
</P>
<P>
 Just seeing an ABC agent, Matty said, may prompt more vigilance from bar 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds them that ABC is here," she said. "They don't know how many people 
are with me undercover. It's just like when you go down the freeway and see a 
highway patrolman. You slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 Some bar owners say it is their businesses that will be slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the World Cup goes, my locals will be gone too," fumed Billy Bitonti, 
who owns Billy's Dugout, Domenico's and Big D's Sports Bar on Fair Oaks Avenue, 
across the street from where buses drop off World Cup fans. "People leave 
cursing me, saying: 'I'm never going to come back here.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Bitonti received two citations for serving intoxicated patrons. But the 
longtime bar owner says he knows when someone is drunk. All his employees have 
attended ABC seminars on intoxication and viewed a videotape on how to spot 
intoxicated patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have kids, I have family, this is my life, and I'm not going to send 
someone out to the street to get into a car crash," Bitonti said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is frustrated because he added an outdoor patio -- only to be told 
by ABC agents two days before the first game that he could not serve alcohol 
outside because he had not completed the paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 A party of 80 Swedes had reserved part of the restaurant to throw a pregame 
party. Bitonti had to tell the disappointed Swedes they could not drink 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners say some of the ABC agents appear too young to be making arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought in a lot of young agents who don't have a lot of experience," 
said Art Jong, owner of the Old Town Pub. "If this is the biggest sporting 
event in the world, the ABC should bring in their veterans." 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC acknowledges that it has a far younger force than ever before. Its 
staff was slashed several years ago during budget cuts and the ABC has been 
aggressively hiring recent college graduates to fill its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ABC says the young officers have experienced supervisors and are 
well-versed in the alcohol codes. "We didn't just let loose a bunch of 
rookies," Falletta said. "It's very controlled." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, say those who work in Old Town's bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Konrad, a doorman at the 35'er bar on Colorado Boulevard, said he was 
slammed against the wall by two ABC agents who attempted to handcuff him after 
he tried to prevent a third agent from walking out of the bar with an open 
container of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Konrad, 26, said the agents did not identify themselves until after the 
incident, when they responded: "We're the ------- ABC." 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC disputes the charges of heavy-handedness. In many cases, the specifics 
of the disputes are tough to nail down -- lost in the chaos of the clamoring 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 The ABC has a different version of the bust at the Old Town Pub on June 18. 
They say Brasile, the bartender, was too busy dancing to notice that the 30ish 
man at the bar was completely blitzed. 
</P>
<P>
 His eyes were nearly closed and his face flush, investigators wrote in their 
report of the incident. His hat was on sideways and he was swaying in place. 
The man put a cigarette into his mouth the wrong way, with the filter sticking 
out. When he tried to light the mangled cigarette, a piece of flaming cigarette 
fell onto the man's shirt. He didn't flinch, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to me that he exhibited clear signs of intoxication," said 
Falletta, the ABC spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Some complaints against the ABC come from those who acknowledge that they 
broke the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Nicole, who is 20 years and 9 months old -- three months below the 
state's minimum drinking age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday night, Nicole was enjoying a beer in Gordon Biersch, a trendy 
Old Town micro-brewery, when a man in a pink shirt looked at her strangely. She 
made eye contact. "Stupid, stupid," she said later. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was an undercover ABC officer and she was busted. 
</P>
<P>
 Right in front of this good-looking crowd, Nicole was led away to the front 
door. She denied having a fake ID, although she really did. She said she will 
never be back although privately she vowed that she will. Luckily for her, the 
ABC sent her on her way without a citation -- which could have led to a fine, 
community service and the revocation of her driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's absolutely absurd," said Nicole, an Arcadia resident. "I'm 
appalled. It's embarrassing. I think they have to worry about these drunk 
people who are going to drive home. I could understand if I was completely 
drunk, but I only had one beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Wise Guys, Noa Carillo, who says he stops in at the bar from time to 
time, tried to wheedle his way through the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please let me in, I don't want to drink any more beers, I just want to go 
in," asked Carillo, his eyes reddened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry," Bukowski told him. "Too much cerveza. You have to come back 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Also turned away was David Ferris of Highland Park, who forgot his ID. Ferris 
took it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm obviously 21, but I don't blame them at all. They're just doing their 
job." 
</P>

 World Cup organizers have been antsy about alcohol from the start. Initially, 
they sought to ban alcohol entirely in Pasadena on game days -- a practice that 
has become common in Europe, where drunk fans have turned into soccer 
hooligans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 games became known as the Teetotaler World Cup when all dozen Italian 
cities hosting the championship announced citywide alcohol restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena city officials decided that would be going too far. But they 
mobilized local law enforcement agencies to keep the revelry from getting out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer companies have seized the games as the ultimate promotion opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Budweiser is the official beer of the World Cup, paying a reported $7 million 
to support the soccer series, and its logo is featured in countless watering 
holes on promotional banners, flags and inflatable soccer balls. 
</P>
<P>
 But other companies are also seeking to take full advantage of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 35'er, a representative for Bitburger beer was roaming through the bar 
selling what she called the official lager of the German soccer team. For every 
glass purchased, she offered a raffle ticket to compete for a soccer ball and 
other prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tecate was employing even more provocative marketing methods across the street 
at another bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Tecate '94, wearing a white Tecate mini-dress and black cowboy boots, was 
signing autographed posters of herself and posing for photos with celebrating 
Brazilian fans. Tecates were on special at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are crazy because of the win, but they're minding their 
manners," said Kathy Bolter, one of a handful of Miss Tecates. "They're 
treating me like just one of the guys."

GERMAN TROOPS JOIN BASTILLE DAY PARADE IN PARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 German soldiers paraded down the famed Champs Elysees on Thursday, the 205th 
anniversary of the French Revolution, riding armored vehicles through the city 
for the first time since 1944 in a grand though controversial gesture of French 
and German reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200 German troops, part of a new, five-nation Eurocorps commanded by 
German Gen. Helmut Willmann, joined 7,000 marchers in the annual military 
parade, passing in review before French President Francois Mitterrand, German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and other visiting dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a lot of emotions," Mitterrand, a Resistance leader during the 1940-44 
Nazi occupation, said later. "But, most of all, I was happy that we are able to 
choose between the past and the future, and that we choose the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitterrand had invited Kohl and the Eurocorps to the annual Bastille Day 
festivities in hopes of ending, once and for all, the legacy of bitterness 
stemming from World War II. But the decision was sharply criticized by many in 
France, where it touched off emotional opposition from those who find it 
difficult to forgive the four-year Nazi occupation of this country. 
</P>
<P>
 German officials were deliberately not invited to commemorations last month of 
the 50th anniversary of the Allied D-day landings in Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitterrand said the parade on Bastille Day -- which marks the storming of 
a notorious prison, an event that launched the revolution against the monarchy 
-- was the proper occasion for closing the book on the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The young German soldiers from the 294th Panzer Grenadier Battalion paraded as 
part of the Eurocorps contingent, made up of soldiers from Germany, France, 
Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg. The force will not be fully operational until 
October, 1995, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans roared down the broad avenue, from the Arc de Triomphe to the 
Place de la Concorde, in armored vehicles bearing a black-and-white military 
cross that closely resembles the Iron Cross of World War II. A French military 
band played Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," the official Eurocorps anthem, as the 
multinational units arrived at the reviewing stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of onlookers lined the avenue on a warm, overcast day and greeted 
the procession with loud applause, an ovation repeated for two other crowd 
favorites, the French Foreign Legion and the Fire Brigade. Jet fighters sailed 
over the wide avenue, leaving trails of smoke in the blue, white and red colors 
of the French flag. 
</P>
<P>
 For most in France, especially those born after the war, the goodwill gesture 
was welcome. Recent opinion polls indicated that about two-thirds of the French 
public supported the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 But many older French, especially those who had relatives killed by the Nazi 
war machine, grumbled. They said they see these German soldiers not as symbols 
of a future unified Europe but rather as descendants of a regime that nearly 
succeeded in stealing France from the French. 
</P>
<P>
 French Adm. Philippe de Gaulle, son of the late president and leader of Free 
France during the war, said he was opposed to the spectacle. "This is neither 
the place nor the date," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition cut across party lines, from the Communist Party to former 
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing to at least one minister in the current 
conservative government. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Pasqua, minister of the interior and a former Resistance fighter, 
joined those arguing that it was too soon. "This is the 50th anniversary of the 
liberation," he said. "Next year would have been a better choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitterrand, 77, who was wounded and taken prisoner during the war, said he 
sympathized with Pasqua and remembered his own "profound sadness" when the 
Germans marched into Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "But today, I feel joy at the thought that half a century has been enough to 
resolve the problems of two world wars," Mitterrand said. Pasqua and others 
were "thinking of the past," he added. "I am thinking of the future. We must 
think of Europe and we must prepare a united Europe. We can't spend our time 
lamenting the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl appeared to be sensitive to the feelings of many in Europe during this 
year of World War II anniversaries. In a move welcomed by many in France, Kohl 
brought with him to the parade Thursday three sons of Germans executed for 
their links to the failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in July, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sons was Manfred Rommel, 65, the mayor of Stuttgart. His father, 
Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, whose military genius was respected on both sides 
of the war, was forced to commit suicide by Hitler when his ties to the 
plotters were revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl said the invitation to appear here, half a century after the Nazi 
soldiers were driven from the city in defeat, was "a great gesture" and proof 
of French-German friendship and European cooperation. "Now, we are together, 
and that is fantastic," he said after the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper this week, Kohl 
recalled that "the last time German soldiers walked down the Champs Elysees, 
they were prisoners, they were spat and sworn at." As for those who opposed the 
German presence, Kohl said: "Those who don't understand how things have changed 
can't be helped." 
</P>
<P>
 But, for many of the old French Resistance fighters, the memories of the Nazi 
occupation are still as fresh as yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days after seizing Paris on June 14, 1940, the German army rolled down 
the Champs Elysees, as victorious French armies had for two centuries before; 
they goose-stepped down the street every day at noon during the occupation. The 
Allies arrived on the shores of Normandy on June 6, 1944, and Paris was 
liberated Aug. 23, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have in front of my eyes the images of the Germans marching down the 
Champs Elysees in 1940," said Adam Raisky, an elderly man who wore a yellow 
star on his vest as a reminder of the Jews killed in World War II. "In my head, 
I can still hear the noise of their boots." 
</P>
<P>
 M. Laurent, a nurse in the French Resistance during the war, boycotted the 
parade this year. "I'm not going to watch it," she said. "It is scandalous. It 
makes me feel sick." 
</P>

SURGE IN MERGERS SHOWING ECONOMIC PLUSES, MINUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS Inc. Chairman Laurence A. Tisch shocked the business world earlier this 
week by announcing he was abandoning his plan to merge with QVC, the hot 
home-shopping network. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a day later, retailers Macy and Federated agreed to merge, creating the 
most formidable department store chain in America. Eli Lilly & Co. also said 
this week that it would pay a stunning $4 billion to expand into health care 
benefit management, buying PCS Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer volume of recent company takeover announcements, some more tenuous 
than others, is demonstrating the powerful pull that the forces of 
consolidation and restructuring still have on corporate America -- even as the 
economy improves, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 While some highly publicized mergers have fallen through, many others are 
going forward, often with much less fanfare but with no less significance for 
their industries. 
</P>
<P>
 And as with the 1980s takeover boom, the fallout from this one is having both 
positive and negative effects on the broad economy. Thus, how this merger wave 
will ultimately play with the public, employees and investors is still an open 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, though Americans are increasingly convinced that the economy is 
getting better, the rising number of mergers points to another major round of 
job cuts on the horizon, economists warn. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the ongoing urge of U.S. companies to expand via 
acquisitions is bolstering the competitive advantage that corporate America 
enjoys over foreign rivals, many analysts contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that, in turn, could spur a dramatic increase in foreign bids for U.S. 
businesses, as overseas companies seek to harness U.S. know-how -- and at cheap 
prices, given the plunge in the dollar's value this year. A new round of 
foreign takeovers could add another element of uncertainty to the lives of 
American workers on the receiving end of such bids. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the recent acceleration of the takeover boom that began last year is 
largely domestically driven, and encompasses a wide spectrum of the economy -- 
from retailing to telecommunications to health care. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, for example, retail giants R.H. Macy & Co. and Federated 
Department Stores agreed to merge in a $4.1-billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, two leading providers of wireless communications services, 
Nextel Communications and OneComm Corp., said they will combine in a 
$650-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, drug titan Eli Lilly agreed to pay McKesson Corp. $4 billion for 
its PCS Health Systems division, which manages the dispensing of drugs for a 
large number of corporate benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the value of domestic mergers announced this year already totals 
$131.6 billion, up from $105.5 billion at this point a year ago, according to 
deal-tracker Securities Data Co. in Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of deals announced so far this year is 3,843, up from 3,179 a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With half the year to go, the 1994 merger tally has nearly surpassed the 
full-year total of $136.8 billion in 1991 -- the low point for takeover 
activity after the economic and banking crises of 1990 put a temporary end to 
corporate consolidation, following the wild deal days of the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the motivation behind the merger explosion of the '90s is vastly 
different from that of the '80s. The latter half of the last decade was an era 
of deals often done for financial reasons: Firms were bought by professional 
takeover artists, most of whom simply broke up their targets and sold off the 
pieces for a quick return. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, most deals are between consenting companies that see material gains in 
productivity and competitive critical mass in joining, said Guy Wyser-Pratte, a 
veteran New York investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all of the deals you're seeing today are for strategic reasons," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The strengthening economy only adds to the urgency many companies feel to 
combine, experts say. As business opportunities expand, so too does the 
corporate view that the smartest strategic move is to quickly boost market 
share and thus derive a bigger earnings boost from the economy's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the merger movement is being abetted by the ample availability of 
bank financing, as banks step up their lending again. 
</P>
<P>
 And ironically, the stock market's overall decline this year has effectively 
lowered the prices of many desirable corporate targets, as their stocks have 
slumped. 
</P>
<P>
 From a company's standpoint, "the best time to buy is when people are 
selling," said Frank Baxter, head of Jefferies Group, a Los Angeles-based 
brokerage and investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He regards the takeover wave as "a bullish thing for the American economy," 
because it promises stronger companies that should be better able to compete in 
the global arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But while many Wall Streeters are preaching the merits of mergers, investors 
-- and the public -- may be growing more doubtful about the supposed benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race to develop the information highway, for example, some of the key 
merger deals announced among telephone, cable TV and entertainment companies 
last year have since been called off. 
</P>
<P>
 The blame for the deals' unraveling was partly attributed to the huge egos 
involved, as media and communications moguls discovered that sharing power was 
far less attractive in practice than in principle, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a bigger problem was that investors reacted with skepticism to many of the 
mergers, pushing down the prices of the stocks involved in apparent rejection 
of the marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 The most celebrated such broken deal involved Bell Atlantic Corp. and cable TV 
leader Tele-Communications Inc. This week, the planned merger of CBS and QVC 
was broken up when a large QVC investor, Comcast Corp., decided to make its own 
bid for QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 While Comcast had strategic reasons for stopping a QVC-CBS deal, investors in 
general have shown disdain for some of the other deals announced recently. Eli 
Lilly's stock, for example, plunged from $57.375 to $50 on Monday, as many 
investors decided Lilly was overpaying for PCS Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer networker Wellfleet Communications last week saw its shares dive more 
than 20% after agreeing to buy rival SynOptics in a $1-billion stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts note that the buyers' stocks in merger deals often fall for technical 
reasons related to the transactions, especially in cases where shares are to be 
exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, investors' unwillingness to embrace some of this year's big deals may 
reflect fears that the transactions haven't been well thought out, said Sharon 
Kalin, a takeover-stock trader at Athene-Coronado Capital in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in the area of new technology, "The (corporate) attitude is, if 
you're not there first you're going to get left out," Kalin said. But investors 
may be worrying that the rush to do deals is leading to ill-advised 
transactions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the public's (and employees') reaction to rising takeover activity 
may also turn increasingly negative. The reason: The end result of nearly all 
corporate mergers is a substantial loss of jobs, as the combined company 
eliminates duplicated departments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Macy-Federated merger, for example, California alone may lose hundreds 
of jobs as the two chains consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still uncertain is whether an expected wave of new foreign investment in the 
United States will produce similar cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 American companies are now attractive to potential foreign buyers for two 
reasons, experts say: U.S. businesses are, by and large, financially healthy 
and highly competitive. And with the dollar's deep slide, the purchase price of 
U.S. assets has fallen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 A foreign takeover wave "has to come" as the global economy advances, argues 
Jefferies' Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Americans, the odd juxtaposition of a better economy and still-rising 
layoffs is difficult to comprehend, said Lynn Reaser, economist at First 
Interstate Bank. Yet "the corporate restructuring wave is by no means over," 
she said, and rising merger activity will only accelerate job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The still-high level of layoffs is evident in weekly figures showing new 
claims for unemployment benefits, Reaser said. Last week, those claims rose by 
19,000 to 363,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Reaser also notes that the economy created a net 1.72 million new 
jobs in the first half of the year -- despite continuing layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Hayes, professor of finance at Harvard University, argues that while 
the social costs of U.S. companies' consolidation can't be ignored, mergers 
that ultimately boost productivity will have a long-term payoff for the 
American economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our competitiveness in the global economy today can be attributed in large 
part to the restructurings that began in the 1980s," Hayes said. "There's no 
question that this has on balance been a good thing."

PROSECUTORS STILL WRESTLING WITH DECISION ON COWLINGS; LAW: WHETHER TO CHARGE 
O.J. SIMPSON'S FRIEND IN THE CHASE ALSO HAS SERIOUS IMPACT ON MURDER 
DEFENDANT'S TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caught between competing interests and faced with daunting legal complexities, 
prosecutors for a third straight day put off a decision Thursday about whether 
to charge Al Cowlings with a crime for his role in O.J. Simpson's bizarre trek 
on Southern California freeways last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Cowlings, a lifelong friend and former teammate of Simpson's, is 
expected in court today, district attorney's officials said they plan to ask 
for more time to investigate the possible case against him. 
</P>
<P>
 That no decision has been made reflects the pressures behind the scenes as 
prosecutors weigh a choice that may have significant implications not only for 
Cowlings, but for Simpson as well. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side are police, eager to see Cowlings prosecuted for his role in the 
chase, irritated by his behavior at the scene of Simpson's surrender, and 
determined to see that actions they consider criminal are treated like a crime. 
On the other side are prosecutors, seeking to show resolve in dealing with a 
person booked for aiding a fugitive, yet facing a potentially difficult task 
convicting Cowlings, and who are said to be concerned that prosecuting him 
might complicate their double murder case against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, a Cowlings prosecution could stymie any effort by government 
lawyers to gain access to Simpson's friend -- who can legally refuse to testify 
in any trial as long as he is a potential criminal defendant. Trying Cowlings 
also would take time and energy from prosecutors racing to meet a speedy trial 
deadline in the Simpson case, and could give Simpson's defense lawyers access 
to discovery material and testimony that they might not otherwise be able to 
get in preparation for the Simpson trial, legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given all of that, experienced lawyers generally doubt that Cowlings will be 
charged. Even some police who support the idea are skeptical that the district 
attorney's office will choose to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stakes for the district attorney were raised this week with the 
disclosure that a passport and nearly $10,000 were found in the Ford Bronco 
that Cowlings drove on the afternoon of the fateful, low-speed police chase 
through Orange County and Los Angeles. Simpson was riding in the back of that 
car, cradling a loaded gun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The passport and money could suggest that Simpson's motive was not to commit 
suicide or to visit his ex-wife's grave, but rather to flee. And if that were 
the true motive, it could suggest that Cowlings was aiding a fugitive -- as 
police alleged when he was arrested -- rather than trying to keep his lifelong 
friend from committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings was arrested June 17 after the nationally-televised pursuit ended in 
Simpson's Brentwood driveway. Although officers said he interfered with their 
efforts to negotiate with Simpson, they also noted that he came to their aid at 
one point, delivering a new cellular phone to Simpson when the one he was using 
stopped working. After Simpson surrendered, Cowlings was booked on suspicion of 
aiding a fugitive and released after posting a $250,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Re, the highly regarded defense attorney representing Cowlings, said 
his client never meant to assist Simpson's flight and that even if the passport 
and money were recovered, Cowlings had no knowledge of them. Re added that he 
has been in contact with prosecutors but that they have given him little hint 
about which way they are leaning as they weigh the evidence against his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts outside the district attorney's office say a number of issues 
are likely to influence the decision whether to prosecute. In particular, they 
said, prosecutors have to be concerned about avoiding any misstep in the 
Cowlings case that could undermine their principal objective, to convict 
Simpson of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 One consideration in the Cowlings case, they said, is the issue of Cowlings' 
rights under the 5th Amendment, which protects citizens from being compelled to 
give testimony against themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As a potential defendant, Cowlings has the right to remain silent and cannot 
be forced to testify, either at his trial or at Simpson's. But few people have 
greater knowledge of Simpson and virtually no one other than Cowlings knows the 
full story of what he and Simpson did during the six hours that they were 
unaccounted for on June 17, the day Simpson was scheduled to surrender to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble for prosecutors is that if they file charges against Cowlings, he 
can exercise his right against self-incrimination to refuse to discuss with 
government lawyers the events of that day. Only by dropping the charges or by 
granting him immunity might prosecutors get access to Cowlings. The trade-off: 
They would lose the chance to prosecute him for any role he might have had in 
harboring or aiding a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the prosecution wants to force Cowlings to testify with regard to that 
afternoon and evening, then they would have to provide legal assurance that he 
will not be prosecuted," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor. 
"Otherwise, he has the right to invoke the 5th Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 John Wiley, a UCLA law professor and former federal prosecutor, agreed and 
said prosecutors would almost certainly weigh that decision carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main prosecution interest has got to be to talk to him," Wiley said. 
"They need to get him on the record, but they can't do that as long as he's a 
defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 There is yet another consideration. If prosecutors granted Cowlings immunity, 
he could still refuse to talk to them before testifying. If called to the 
witness stand, he would have no right to refuse, but prosecutors would have no 
advance idea of what he might say, and they would almost certainly be reluctant 
to put Simpson's close friend on the stand without some sense of the testimony 
he would give. 
</P>
<P>
 All those considerations have made the decision about whether to prosecute a 
complicated one, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they weighed their decision in the Cowlings case, officials in the district 
attorney's office also sought to fend off yet another flare-up at the margins 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night, KCBS-TV broadcast footage of Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark 
at Simpson's home on the morning that police received a warrant to search the 
property. The station reported that Clark was pictured before the service of 
the warrant and suggested that her presence could raise problems for the 
prosecution -- specifically because it might allow defense attorneys to call 
her as a witness in their efforts to have the search warrant invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the station, the videotape of Clark at the scene was transmitted 
to the station at 10:28 a.m. on the day of the search -- June 13. The search 
warrant was signed by a judge at 10:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts generally downplayed the significance of Clark's presence at the 
scene, saying that even if she were there before the service of the search 
warrant, that would not necessarily be a problem. Clark could have been there 
to answer any legal questions by police officers or even to safeguard against 
any improper searches while awaiting the delivery of the warrant, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that she's there on the premises is not a problem," said Harland W. 
Braun, a prominent Los Angeles defense attorney and former local prosecutor. 
"In fact, you could make the argument that it's good to have her out there 
supervising." 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Terrell, a local civil rights lawyer, said Simpson's attorneys could make 
an issue of Clark's presence if it turns out that she was there before the 
issuance of the search warrant. "If she was there before the warrant was issued 
and she participated in gathering of illegally obtained evidence, there's a 
question about her standing in the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office, in a highly unusual response to a media report 
about the Simpson case, released a brief written statement saying the 
television station's account was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Clark arrived at the location following the delivery of the warrant to 
give legal advice on the execution of the warrant, as is often done by lawyers 
in our office," the statement read. "The district attorney's office will have 
no further statement on this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Jordan, news director for KCBS, said the station stands by its report. 
Jordan reiterated that the time stamp on the videotape confirms that it was 
transmitted at 10:28 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technician who took in the feed also wrote on the tape box the time he 
sent it in," said Jordan. "That was 10:26. He was a little off, but it supports 
us. Our time stamp is accurate."

COLUMN ONE; MOSCOW'S BROTHERS YAKOVLEV; THE THREE CHILDREN ADMIT THEY KILLED A 
MAN AND SAY THEY STEAL TO SURVIVE. THEIR LIFE OF CRIME REFLECTS A BOOM IN 
JUVENILE DELINQUENCY FUELED BY A BREAKDOWN IN THE POST-SOVIET SOCIAL SYSTEM.

<P>
 They knocked the drunk down and beat in his face with paving stones, kicking 
him and punching him with all the viciousness coiled in their wiry boys' 
bodies, until his rattling grunts stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 They watched him die. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the three Yakovlev brothers, all younger than 15 at the time, cleaned out 
his pockets -- although they did not kill him to rob him, said the youngest. 
</P>
<P>
 "He swore at us, and we're just kids, and he said bad words about our mother, 
we beat him for that, that's what we killed him for," 11-year-old Volodya piped 
in his choirboy soprano. 
</P>
<P>
 If you happen to visit Moscow this summer and gravitate to the famous 
McDonald's on Pushkin Square, you could run into Volodya, still out on the 
streets, one of a gang of smudge-faced, sour-smelling boys in filthy clothes 
who beg from foreign tourists and hire themselves out as car-watchers to 
Mercedes owners. 
</P>
<P>
 For Russia, Volodya and his brothers are a new phenomenon, and perhaps the 
most ominous symptom of the rot afflicting the heart of this society, whose 
moral bearings and basic order were swept out along with the obsolete ideology 
of the old Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanislav Govorukhin, the eternally gloomy Russian director, warned in "The 
Great Criminal Revolution," his latest film: "A new tribe is growing up now -- 
dark, criminal. An uneducated tribe of slaves." 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia's future is being stolen," he said. "Children are the future of a 
country, and what the country will become depends on how its children grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile delinquency is booming in Russia, fueled by daily proof in this 
mob-ridden country that crime pays and helped along by disorder in the courts, 
schools and city councils that used to help keep it under control. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, crimes by minors jumped 13%, nearly 10 times more than the overall 
crime rise of 1.4%, and they are multiplying even faster this year. Officials 
say Russia now has 60,000 homeless juveniles, while money for boarding schools 
and rehabilitation dwindles, producing a class of what social workers refer to 
as "children in crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 "A generation of criminals is growing up right before our eyes," said Vladimir 
Kolokoltsev, chief of the 108th Police Precinct that covers the very center of 
Moscow.  
</P>
<P>
 On the city's streets, it has become common to see children of 8 or 9 weaving 
through traffic to hawk drinks and newspapers or to beg from drivers in the 
middle of what should be a school day. Train stations host bands of urchins, 
and police report a sharp rise in juvenile prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in this context that the Yakovlev family -- Volodya, his six siblings 
and widowed, semi-invalid mother -- have gained a certain renown as the face of 
Russia's rapid social decay. The Izvestia newspaper called them "The Little 
Killers From the Underpass" and the Kuranty daily used their tale of murder as 
a jumping-off point for a list of recent hideous crimes by minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalia Ptushkina, the juvenile officer at the 108th Precinct, first noticed 
the Yakovlevs early last year, when they started coming downtown from their 
working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "What could literally be called a children's gang was forming," she said. "It 
began from a common interest in money -- first they washed cars, then begged in 
the streets, and soon took to stealing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gangs are not uncommon in Russia, though with their heavy emphasis on 
money-making they tend to resemble Prohibition-era packs of criminals rather 
than modern L.A.-style street fighters. But a children's gang, and such an 
aggressive one, was something new. 
</P>
<P>
 When the police pulled in the four youngest Yakovlevs -- Volodya, 11, Dima, 
12, Vitya, 14, and Andrei, 15 -- they often found packets of money, expensive 
toys and personal stereos on them. The boys admitted to rolling drunks for the 
money, but because no victims ever came to complain, the police could not file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar legal loophole has kept Volodya and Vitya on the streets even after 
they admitted to participating in murder. Russian law says that children can be 
held responsible for crimes beginning at age 14. Vitya turned 14 after the 
killing; Andrei, who also took part, is in a juvenile detention center, 
possibly for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, about 100,000 Russian minors younger than 14 committed crimes for 
which they cannot be held responsible, according to police statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically, we can send them to reform schools, but unfortunately we now 
have very few such institutions and only about 3,000 of those kids who 
committed crimes last year were sent to such schools," said Lt. Gen. Vyacheslav 
Ogorodnikov, head of the Russian Interior Ministry's public order division. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, violent youths are ushered into an elaborate juvenile justice 
system, although it too has been overburdened by a sharp rise in teen-age 
crime. Each year, more than 40,000 youthful offenders pass through that system 
in Los Angeles alone, with at least 4,000 housed on any given day in one of the 
county Probation Department's three juvenile halls or 20 probation camps. 
</P>
<P>
 But a minor accused of murder in California may be tried as an adult, and 
receive a sentence as harsh as life in prison without parole, if he or she was 
at least 16 at the time of the killing. Murderers younger than 16 usually are 
sentenced to the California Youth Authority, a sort of juvenile prison system, 
where state law requires that all inmates be released when they turn 25.  
</P>
<P>
 For Moscow's Brothers Yakovlev, however, the boys who admitted to coldblooded, 
lighthearted murder, no such punishment awaited their crime.  
</P>
<P>
 It was on Feb. 24 at 2 a.m. that Volodya approached a 60-year-old mechanic who 
was staggering through the underpass at Pushkin Square and asked for a 
cigarette. The man sent him off with a curse, and Volodya enlisted his two 
brothers in taking revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Volodya tells the story differently every time, and Vitya communicates mainly 
in monosyllables or belches, but the consensus is that after the murder the 
boys called an ambulance to see what would happen. When the doctors reported 
that they had encountered a bunch of kids near the corpse, the police knew whom 
to seek. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys, meanwhile, brought the money they had found on the drunk to their 
mother and went to school the next day -- a rare event -- because they knew 
that bananas, rice and other food aid would be distributed there. At school, 
they pretended that nothing had happened. When arrested, however, they 
confessed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 And kept confessing. According to Izvestia, the boys claimed to have killed 
several other drunks, including two in the town of Oryol and one whom they 
followed off a tram and ambushed because, they said, he had insulted a girl 
they were with and tried to avoid paying his fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama knows we killed him," Volodya told a police officer. "She told us not to 
do that anymore. We agreed that we wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have been able to confirm only the Pushkin Square killing and 
that it is likely the brothers' other "killings" were actually beatings in 
which the victims managed to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-family crime wave continues. Kolokoltsev said the two younger boys 
were recently caught stealing bottles of liquor from the Night Flight disco 
near Pushkin Square. Once again, because they were underage, they were let off. 
</P>
<P>
 "They promised they wouldn't kill again but couldn't promise that they 
wouldn't steal," Kolokoltsev said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yakovlevs steal, they say, to support their mother, Svetlana, a 
44-year-old who acknowledges that she looks more like 70, with her hair 
thinning and many teeth gone. Social workers and police say she actively sends 
the boys onto the streets to bring home money, but she denies it vehemently, 
saying she believes that they neither stole nor killed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't send them to steal or gather bottles," she said. "I pull them home 
with both hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Home, however, is not a good place -- a foul apartment in the working-class 
district of Strogino. It is big by Russian standards but not big enough for six 
sons, the oldest of which already has a wife and baby, and one daughter. The 
stairwell still smells of smoke from a recent attempt, probably by hostile 
neighbors, to burn the Yakovlevs' door; the elevator stinks like a public 
restroom. The interior looks as if it had been attacked by some kind of urban 
locust -- almost stripped of furniture, room doors missing, wallpaper peeling, 
scattered mattresses where the children sleep when they sleep at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys scramble about, monkey-like, throwing karate kicks in the air, eating 
spaghetti with their hands, scrabbling at adults and dipping into visitors' 
pockets, practicing their only English: "Give me one dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yakovlevs' father died last year of alcohol-related poisoning. He used to 
beat the children so badly that they would run away for months, Svetlana said; 
a night clerk in a food store, he drank through his salary and most of the 
family's possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives on a disability pension of about $50 a month, she said, plus some 
state support for the children. The boys "feed themselves," and on a recent 
evening they brought home bread, cheese and butter for her as well. She has 
fought every attempt to institutionalize them and, at least for those 14 and 
younger, has won. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't want to go to an orphanage because this is home; here they're 
their own masters," she said. If they are taken away, "I just know they'll 
either run away or kill themselves. Vitya at first didn't know where to cut 
himself," she said, slicing at her wrist with her index finger. "Now he knows 
where." 
</P>
<P>
 In the old Soviet days of totalitarian control over private lives, the problem 
of the Yakovlevs would have been solved simply, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was a curfew that did not allow children younger than 16 to be 
out on the streets without their parents after 11 p.m. Second, Ptushkina of the 
108th Precinct said, district Commissions on Juvenile Affairs had the power to 
deprive abusive or neglectful parents of their children and send the kids to 
orphanages or reform schools. Authorities could also fine parents for their 
children's crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, there were levers," she said. "If parents didn't take care of their 
kids, you could go to their workplace and hold meetings to put pressure on 
them. And the Commissions on Juvenile Affairs worked much better than now -- 
during the reorganization of Moscow for a couple of years they ceased to exist 
altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, "I can't even say we have a system" to deal with troubled 
children, "so much has been destroyed or made so complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 The school system too is caught in disarray and financial crisis. Once, 
teachers would have come to the Yakovlevs' home to get the truants back to 
school; no more, not on current salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that money troubles have also led to an increase in family 
problems. Economic reforms and the massive inflation they have brought have 
made it nearly impossible to live on an average salary. Many parents become so 
preoccupied with scraping out a living that they have far less time for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of money has also cut back drastically on healthy recreation for 
children. In the summertime at least, the Yakovlevs could once have gone to 
Communist youth organization camps. Now, Kolokoltsev said, the camps are 
largely either given over to refugees or priced out of the range of most 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 A bureaucratic battle is still being waged over the Yakovlev children, with 
authorities trying to prove that Svetlana is an unfit mother who should be 
deprived of the right to keep her children at home. 
</P>
<P>
 But even police and social workers seem to suffer from a confused lack of will 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political situation has changed -- many things we were taught have been 
turned upside-down and even for an adult it's hard to figure out what's right 
and wrong," Ptushkina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she sent many children away during 10 years of working in a 
neighborhood like the Yakovlevs', the idea of institutionalizing kids no longer 
much appeals to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really do anything," she said. "I can't really help the Yakovlevs. 
I'd only deprive the mother of her parental rights and make things worse," by 
sending the kids to schools where they would become hardened criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what she does, she is sure, there is only one possible outcome for 
the Yakovlevs: "Their road leads straight to prison."

KEY SENATORS URGE CAUTION ON HAITI; CARIBBEAN: MITCHELL, NUNN LEAD CALLS TO 
GIVE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SANCTIONS MORE TIME. ADMINISTRATION SAYS NO 
MILITARY ACTION IS IMMINENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Powerful Democratic senators warned the Clinton Administration on Thursday 
against an invasion of Haiti to topple the military regime there, drawing new 
assurances from officials that no military action is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Senate on Thursday rejected a Republican effort to 
restrain the President from ordering military action in Haiti. Although the 
Democrats defeated the GOP proposal, many of Clinton's allies made it clear 
that they harbor deep doubts about using force to resolve the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Armed Services Chairman 
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) -- whose backing Clinton would want for any military action -- 
both urged the Administration to give economic and political sanctions more 
time to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's premature for (an invasion) now," Mitchell said late Wednesday after 
meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary William 
J. Perry and White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. "The sanctions 
have only been in place for a few weeks. I think they ought to be given more 
time to see if they can, without military intervention, do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to think through very carefully what the purpose of an invasion 
would be," Nunn said Thursday. He said he would support military action to 
protect U.S. citizens but argued that restoring democracy to Haiti "is not an 
urgent priority" and does not justify an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that, despite military exercises simulating an 
invasion -- designed, in part, to make Haiti's military leaders worry about one 
-- Clinton is not moving toward an early decision on intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, the option we're pursuing is the sanctions option. We believe 
that's the best way to put pressure on the de facto government and the 
military," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. "We're committed to 
that course of action but, again, the President has not taken the military 
option off the table." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official said Christopher, Lake and Perry delivered 
a similar message to congressional leaders Wednesday -- but added that Clinton 
might order rapid military action if needed to protect U.S. citizens. He noted 
that there have been no serious threats against Americans in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP measure to restrain Clinton was offered by Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.). It would have set up a special committee to study American options in 
Haiti and report within 45 days. The Senate defeated the challenge to Clinton's 
handling of the issue, 57 to 42. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outcome was not so much an endorsement of Clinton's policy as a 
reflection of the Senate's reluctance to impose limits on a President's 
authority to deploy troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Democrats who voted to support the Administration also criticized its 
policy as shifting and vague and expressed conflicting desires to restrain the 
President without encouraging Haiti's military rulers to cling to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for the Haitian military to understand that invasion is an 
option. . . . It must be on the table . . . to have a credible policy," said 
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
But he added that, like most of his colleagues, he "would not support an 
invasion tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry said Clinton has failed to "explain the stakes and the goals" of his 
policy and needs to do "more to convince the American people that we're on a 
clear path" before committing U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Democratic aide observed: "What these guys are really afraid of is 
that Clinton may decide to invade Haiti in August, when everybody's out of town 
campaigning. Without popular support for an invasion, no Democrat running for 
reelection wants to be caught in the position of having to defend it this close 
to November." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn said that rather than invading Haiti, he wants Clinton to "re-target" the 
American economic sanctions to spare the island's poor. Otherwise, he warned, 
the trade embargo will encourage "the exodus to continue . . , which is totally 
counterproductive to our purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole argued that a "45-day delay should not bother the Administration" unless 
it has already decided to invade. He noted that the United States invaded Haiti 
in 1915 and remained as an occupying power for 19 years. "We ought to spend 
some time learning lessons from that intervention before beginning a new one," 
Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said the proposal's only effect would be to 
"take all the diplomatic pressure off of Haiti's military rulers." Dole's 
measure -- an amendment to the $13.7-billion foreign aid appropriations bill -- 
"takes the keys out of the car for a couple of months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said a 
dozen countries in the Western Hemisphere are prepared to commit troops to a 
multinational force that would help keep order in Haiti and retrain its army 
after the military regime steps down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is prepared to participate in this force and to lead it, 
but we invite the participation of other states and expect to receive it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said 15 countries have agreed to participate: the United 
States, Canada, France, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad, 
Guyana, Suriname, Belize, Panama, El Salvador and Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the force is expected to have about 12,000 troops, of whom roughly 
4,000 would be from the United States, 4,000 from Canada and France, and 4,000 
from the Latin American and Caribbean nations. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the Coast Guard 
picked up 178 Haitians at sea Wednesday, the lowest figure since June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said the U.S. government is unsure why the number of refugees fleeing 
by sea has declined sharply from earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But he noted two possible factors: rough seas and an increase in the number of 
Haitians who, following U.S. advice, are applying for refugee status inside 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, the word is getting through in Haiti that, if you take to the 
high seas . . . you are not likely to make (it) to the (U.S.)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's figure brought the number of Haitians picked up since June 15 to 
20,350.

SHALALA REVIVES 'MURPHY BROWN' PREGNANCY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a blunt warning about the dangers of unwed teen-age motherhood, Health and 
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said Thursday that television character 
Murphy Brown set a bad example by having a fictional baby out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 With the comment, Shalala echoed sentiments that led to a storm of controversy 
when uttered two years ago by then-Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone in public life today ought to condone children born out 
of wedlock, . . . even if the family is financially able," Shalala replied when 
Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) asked her whether the unmarried Murphy Brown was 
right or wrong in having a child. Shalala's comments came in testimony before 
the House Ways and Means Committee on President Clinton's welfare reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The pointed remarks by Shalala dramatized the increasing willingness of 
mainstream Democrats to address the destructive social and economic 
consequences of rising birthrates among unmarried women and girls. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of all children now are born to unmarried mothers, representing one 
in five white babies and two of three African American infants, according to 
the National Center for Health Statistics. In the past, many Democrats have 
charged that Quayle and other critics of the trend were racist, sexist or both. 
Clinton has repeatedly raised concerns about the increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle's allusion to the popular "Murphy Brown" sitcom came during a speech on 
May 19, 1992, to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. He called for "social 
sanctions" against women who irresponsibly bear children outside of marriage, 
saying that it "mocks the importance of fathers." The speech was ridiculed by 
Democrats as well as Hollywood celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, then seeking the Democratic Party's nomination, dismissed Quayle's 
comments as "cynical election-year politics." Even then-President George Bush's 
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said at the time: "We don't want to take on a 
popular TV character." 
</P>
<P>
 Informed Thursday of Shalala's remarks, David Beckwith, Quayle's former press 
secretary, told a reporter: "You have made my day. . . . I am pleased that she 
has recognized the obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala said she wants government to tell unwed teen-age mothers that they 
have "made a mistake." Differing with those who advocate distribution of 
condoms in schools as a way to deal with the problem, she declared: "We are 
absolutely committed to promoting abstinence-based programs in the schools as a 
key to preventing teen pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
 She balked, however, at House Republican demands for a federal cut-off of cash 
benefits to welfare mothers who have another child, saying that would leave 
such families destitute.  
</P>
<P>
 She called for a national educational campaign and for community-based 
programs to deliver a clear message to young people about delaying sexual 
activity until they finish high school and find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of the welfare recipients were parents as teens," Shalala said. "If you 
are an unmarried teen-age mother, your chances of ending up poor for the rest 
of your life are very high." 
</P>
<P>
 Without changes in federal policy, she added, half of those on the welfare 
rolls will be teen-agers by the end of this century. "This is a disaster -- 
children having children," Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton's proposal, women under age 18 who have children would be 
required to live with their families or other adults, finish high school and 
take job training or get a job within two years after going on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's plan also would impose new measures to establish 
paternity and require unwed fathers to pay child support, withholding benefits 
from mothers who refuse to cooperate with state agencies in finding the fathers 
and setting up a nationwide system to enforce payment of child support, 
including revocation of driver's licenses of delinquent parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalala said more than 14 million Americans now receive Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children at a cost of more than $22 billion a year, with more than 3 
million recipients added to the rolls in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue has become even more urgent in light of some disturbing trends," 
she testified. "More and more children are born to teen-age mothers and outside 
of marriage. Almost half of all single mothers receiving AFDC -- about 42% -- 
are or have been teen-age mothers." 
</P>
<P>
 While Shalala called for bipartisan backing, Republicans on the Ways and Means 
panel sharply criticized the Clinton plan, arguing that it would be phased in 
too slowly and was sent to Congress far too late in the session to be enacted 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), chairman of the panel, said welfare reform has 
a high priority and Rep. Harold E. Ford (D-Tenn.), chairman of a subcommittee 
with jurisdiction over welfare, said the bill could be passed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In her testimony, however, Shalala said passage of health care reform 
legislation is essential before welfare reform can work effectively. As many as 
15% of women on welfare will be reluctant to give up Medicaid benefits to take 
a job without assurance of health care for children, she said.

CRIME BILL LIKELY TO OMIT 'RACIAL JUSTICE' MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, in a high-risk move that could clear the way for final 
passage of the crime bill, has decided to seek removal of the controversial 
"racial justice" provision from the legislation, which is stalled in a 
House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
announced at a news conference that incoming White House Chief of Staff Leon E. 
Panetta had told him late Wednesday night that the President believed no 
compromise could be reached on the divisive issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration sources confirmed Mfume's account and said the President will 
seek to pass the bill without the provision, which narrowly passed the House 
this spring but was decisively rejected in the Senate. The measure would allow 
defendants to challenge their death sentences with statistics showing that the 
jurisdiction in which they were sentenced had applied the death penalty more 
frequently to one race than to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some proponents vowed to fight on, the President's decision virtually 
guarantees that the racial justice measure will be removed from the final 
conference report. Although that should help the Administration push the bill 
through the Senate, the decision will complicate the legislation's prospects in 
the House -- where liberal Democrats who favor the provision might join forces 
against it with conservative Republicans who oppose the $30-billion bill on 
other grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the White House understands the new math," Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials said they believe that they have a better chance 
to round up enough votes to squeeze the bill through the House than to break 
what is certain to be a Republican filibuster over the racial justice provision 
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign that the Administration may have gambled correctly came late 
Thursday, when a group of 10 black big-city mayors -- including Detroit's 
Dennis Archer, Cleveland's Mike White, Atlanta's Bill Campbell and Denver's 
Wellington Webb -- wrote to Mfume, urging the Black Caucus to support the crime 
bill even without the racial justice provision. 
</P>
<P>
 In a copy of the letter provided to The Times, the mayors indicated support 
for the measure. But they wrote that they did not believe that it "should bring 
down the entire bill. . . . We cannot afford to lose the opportunities this 
bill provides to the people of our cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Staunchly supported by the Black Caucus and civil rights organizations, the 
measure is opposed with equal intensity by the National Assn. of District 
Attorneys and other law enforcement groups, which maintain that it could 
undermine the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the Administration sought to duck that cross-fire by avoiding a 
public position on the issue. Even Thursday, while privately confirming Mfume's 
account, the Administration declined to issue a formal statement -- effectively 
leaving an Administration critic in the extraordinary position of publicly 
announcing the President's long-awaited position on the most controversial 
issue left in the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The extended dispute over the racial justice provision has virtually paralyzed 
the Administration between two contradictory goals: preventing an open conflict 
with the Black Caucus and other liberals while avoiding support for any 
provision that would appear to undercut Clinton's support of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The central question now for Democratic vote counters is how many black 
representatives will abandon the legislation because the racial justice 
provision has been removed. Although some African American representatives are 
likely to oppose the bill because of the Administration's decision, legislative 
sources said others still are likely to support the huge bill -- which will 
offer nearly $20 billion to cities to hire 100,000 new police officers and fund 
crime prevention efforts ranging from job training to education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The black mayors cited those provisions, as well as the bill's ban on assault 
weapons, in their letter to Mfume. The crime bill also contains funds for new 
prisons, a three-strikes provision requiring life imprisonment for repeat 
offenders and an expansion of the federal death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 One congressional source said it was noteworthy that Rep. John Conyers Jr. 
(D-Mich.), a principal sponsor of the racial justice measure and the only 
member of the Black Caucus on the conference committee, did not attend Mfume's 
sharply worded press conference. And Mfume himself said only that "a majority 
of" the 38 Democratic members of the Black Caucus would oppose the legislation 
if the racial justice provision is not included. 
</P>
<P>
 One law enforcement lobbyist closely monitoring the bill also said it is 
unlikely that the entire Black Caucus will oppose the legislation without the 
racial justice provision. "I don't think the caucus will walk en masse ," the 
lobbyist said. "I think they are split up now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, liberals' disappointment over the racial justice provision is almost 
certain to narrow the bill's majority in the House. In the three-corner 
politics of the crime bill, that, ironically, may endanger one component of the 
bill that they ardently support: the ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior House aide said the shrinking margin for error strengthens the hand 
of conservative Democrats threatening to oppose the bill unless the assault 
weapon ban is watered down. 
</P>
<P>
 To discourage liberal defections, the Administration and House Democratic 
leaders are continuing discussions with supporters of the racial justice 
measure, offering carrots and sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 At a private meeting earlier this week, sources said, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
offered to Conyers a carrot: the formation of a commission to study the claims 
of racial bias in the application of the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Administration has been arguing to liberals that, if 
their opposition kills the final bill in the House, it is likely that the 
conference then would tilt the measure further to the right in the hope of 
attracting more Republican support.

23 CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS GAIN ELITE RANKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-three California hospitals are ranked among the top 5% of all U.S. 
hospitals in overall administrative quality, the national agency that sets 
standards for health care institutions reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A special commendation was given to just 273 of the 5,300 institutions 
surveyed by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, 
which has been reviewing hospitals for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission reviews hospitals every three years and the list issued 
Thursday is the first formal roster of a new ranking called "accreditation with 
commendation." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the California hospitals with the highest ranking are nine Kaiser 
facilities, in Anaheim, Bellflower, Panorama City, San Diego, San Francisco, 
Santa Rosa, Vallejo, Walnut Creek and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary accreditation "means they are trying to operate the hospital in a way 
that I can feel reasonably safe going there and increases the likelihood that I 
will be treated well there," said Dr. Paul Schyve, the commission's senior vice 
president. The special commendation ranking means that the "hospital has been 
particularly dedicated in trying to do all things well, not just to meet the 
standards at an average level." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission survey includes more than 2,000 separate standards, including 
such issues as infection control, record-keeping for patients, use of 
pharmaceuticals, training of physicians, and the safety and security of 
buildings. A directive to improve performance in any of the areas means that 
the hospital has a "Type 1" defect and cannot receive the commendation ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranking, in effect, gives a gold star to a hospital's overall performance 
but is not intended as a guide to patients for specific treatments or 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Most surveys of hospital quality measure the outcomes of specific medical 
procedures, such as the percentage of patients who survive heart transplants, 
bypass operations and the like. The Joint Commission survey, in contrast, 
focuses primarily on administrative procedures and specifically excludes such 
medical outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A small local hospital may be excellent but often it does not have specialty 
services," said Schyve. "Clearly, if I have to have a heart transplant I will 
go to the university hospital because a small hospital will not have that kind 
of service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some prestigious university hospital centers are located in old buildings 
needing safety improvements, a problem that could produce a Type 1 defect 
blocking the top rating, Schyve said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of all U.S. hospitals are accredited. The special commendation 
category was created in 1991 and some hospitals that have received the accolade 
have publicized their own awards since then. But the commission waited until a 
full three-year cycle had been completed and all hospitals reviewed to issue 
its first complete roster of the highest-ranked institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really pleased for the 23 California hospitals that did receive the 
commendation," said Dorel Harms, vice president for professional services at 
the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're concerned that no one jump to any conclusions because this is such 
a dynamic process," she said. "The process of review at hospitals has changed 
tremendously in recent years. . . . Over the next three years, we expect that 
probably more hospitals will receive the commendation ranking." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the response was more skeptical. "Inevitably report 
cards are going to become a fact of life for hospitals," said David Langness, 
vice president of communications for the Hospital Council of Southern 
California in Los Angeles. "But we still haven't found one that is completely 
objective and, frankly, I don't know if we ever will." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jack Lord, speaking for the American Hospital Assn., said "all hospitals 
that received accreditation need to be congratulated. It's good to recognize 
that the vast majority of hospitals do get accredited and do score very 
highly." The 5% with the top ranking, he said, "achieved an exceptionally high 
level" of compliance with the commission quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
 California hospitals with the commendation ranking, in addition to the Kaiser 
institutions, are: Enloe Hospital in Chico, Atascadero State Hospital, Scripps 
Memorial in Chula Vista, Sutter Davis Memorial in Davis, Vencor 
Hospital-Sacramento in Folsom, CPC Rancho Lindo in Fontana, Cedar Vista in 
Fresno; Green Hospital of Scripps in La Jolla, Community Hospital of Monterey 
Peninsula, Naval Medical Center in Oakland, Sutter Memorial in Sacramento, 
David Grant USAF Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base, West Hills Medical 
Center and Whittier Hospital Medical Center.

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / FAYE FIORE: 'SHUT UP' IS NOT IN DORNAN'S VOCABULARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now it goes without saying that three pages of anything uttered by virtually 
any member of Congress could put a colicky baby to sleep. But a recently 
published collection of quotations by Orange County Rep. Robert K. Dornan is 
120 pages of rather riveting reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Its very title -- "Shut Up, Fag!" -- suggests the kind of rhetoric that made 
the Garden Grove congressman famous and that authors Nathan Callahan and 
William Payton believe will expose him as the "wildly unfocused" paranoid they 
think he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one thing: It wasn't Dornan who hollered those words to a gay activist at 
an Orange County town forum. It was his wife, Sallie. The authors realized 
this, but reasoned that (A) it's an awfully catchy title and (B) "If she hadn't 
said it, he probably would have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Dornan has been considered one of the most outrageously outspoken 
members ever elected to Congress, a man who called one opponent a "sneaky 
little dirt bag," who branded talk show host Phil Donahue "a boot-licking 
wimp," whom the late House Speaker Tip O'Neill once suggested should see a 
psychiatrist and a man summed up by one vanquished rival as "nearly a lunatic." 
</P>
<P>
 If there are those who say he's dangerous, there are as many who find him 
refreshingly honest, who forcefully agree with his stand against abortion, the 
homosexual lifestyle and communism. He remains one of the biggest money-raisers 
in Congress. Donations pour in from all over the country, many of them from 
people who can't even vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
 But after reading a paperback full of his opinions, one wonders whether any 
other legislator who dared mutter a fraction of what Dornan unabashedly booms 
on radio, TV and the House floor might find himself booted down the Capitol 
steps. After all, the casualty list of people in and out of politics who said 
just one wrong thing is long: 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan Gov. George Romney let it slip that he was brainwashed during a 1965 
visit to Vietnam and ended his chance for the presidency; Earl Butz was forced 
to resign as President Gerald Ford's secretary of agriculture for making a 
racist joke; Andy Rooney was suspended without pay from the CBS News program 
"60 Minutes" for offensive remarks to blacks and gays, and Jesse Jackson has 
never fully lived down "Hymietown." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dornan pushes the envelope time and again with virtual immunity. When he 
said every "lesbian spear-chucker" in the country wanted to see him lose, he 
explained that he really meant to say "spear-carrier," as in the iron-chested 
Wagnerian opera character Brunhilde. He says it was a slip of the tongue that 
caused him to call TV commentator Vladimir Posner a "disloyal betraying little 
Jew," and even his harshest critics concede that he is anything but an 
anti-Semite.  
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of the rest of what's in the book, however, he meant: 
</P>
<P>
 Of President Clinton: "The Commander in Chief is jogging in San Francisco in 
his slit-up-the-sides silk girlie-girlie jogging pants showing us those 
beautiful white doughboy thighs of his." 
</P>
<P>
 Of 1994: "It's the Year of the Penis," referring to the Bobbitts, the police 
photographing Michael Jackson's private parts and Paula Jones' allegations 
against President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 To a colleague wearing sunglasses at night on the House floor: "I feel like 
I'm in a Mexican nightclub." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of times he has apologized. Once the House turned off his microphone. 
Otherwise, Dornan has mastered the art of speaking his mind with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Senate Minority Leader) Bob Dole said those things he would be severely 
censured. He is responsible to the other Republicans in the Congress. Dornan is 
only responsible to his constituency," said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at 
the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan answers to the electorate, not to a presidential Administration that 
might be embarrassed or a television station worried about ratings. And the 
electorate in his, the only Democratic district in conservative Orange County, 
continues to endorse its Republican congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knew I didn't mean it," Dornan said of the two times he misspoke. "I 
had the track record to back it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan says the book is backed by film director Oliver Stone, whom Dornan 
calls "a Bolshevik enemy." Otherwise, he's rather proud of his record as 
displayed in the book, an anthology of patriotic, God-loving eloquence -- with 
the exception of that Year of the Penis stuff, said on a cable television 
comedy show. He regrets that. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Bob Dornan's pathetic attempt at sit-down comedy. It was a mistake," 
Dornan repented, pausing to add: "But it goes without saying, 1994 was the Year 
of the Penis."

WILSON ATTACKS COURT RULING ON WELFARE CUTS; SOCIAL SERVICES: REFORMS ARE IN 
DANGER, HE AND OTHER OFFICIALS CLAIM. ADVOCATES FOR THE POOR SAY THEY ARE 
MISINTERPRETING THE DECISION STRIKING DOWN CUTBACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration clashed with advocacy groups for the poor Thursday, 
claiming that a federal court decision striking down welfare cuts in 1992 could 
also destroy reforms that provide incentives for adults on welfare to go to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-pronged attack on the ruling, Gov. Pete Wilson, Finance Director 
Russell Gould and Department of Social Services Director Eloise Anderson 
separately complained that the court decision, if upheld, would wipe out a 
four-year bipartisan effort to insert a work ethic into California's welfare 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just sort of shocked," Anderson said. The court ruling "destroys the 
benefits that help (welfare recipients) to have a better way of life and to 
join the mainstream and to be treated like every other American is treated." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 opinion, a panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco held Wednesday that millions of dollars in California welfare cuts 
were invalid because government officials had never considered the hardship 
they could impose on poor families. 
</P>
<P>
 The court criticized the George Bush Administration for approving the 
reductions in 1992 without considering evidence provided by advocates for the 
poor that showed that the cuts could cause homelessness and other problems for 
those on government aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, contending Thursday that the court ruling would also affect welfare 
reforms that required federal approval, accused the court of encouraging 
welfare dependency by "robbing more than 50,000 families of the dignity, 
benefits and community acceptance that comes with working." 
</P>
<P>
 At risk, Wilson said, are reforms that encourage work by allowing recipients 
to keep more of what they earn before deductions are made in cash grants that 
they receive from Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the federal-state 
program commonly called welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in jeopardy, the governor said, are reforms that expand child-care 
services for AFDC families with a working parent; allow families to build up 
savings, and provide cash incentives for teen-age recipients to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for the poor, who had filed the lawsuit challenging the legality 
of the welfare cuts, insisted that the Administration had misinterpreted the 
ruling, which they said made no references to any reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing in the court order that requires the state to undo the 
positive welfare reform efforts that have been enacted over the last few years 
to help families," said Casey McKeever, an attorney for the Western Center on 
Law and Poverty. "We think they (Administration officials) are clearly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the only way the reforms could be affected is if Wilson moves to 
repeal them to free up revenue that may be needed to restore the welfare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last four years, Wilson and the Legislature have approved a series of 
welfare cuts that reduced the maximum cash benefits for a typical family of 
three from $694 a month to $593. Although the court's ruling looked 
specifically at cuts in 1992, it could have an impact on welfare reductions 
that have been made in the last three years. These cuts total about $125 
million to $130 million, according a legislative estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, officials in the Administration said they still did not know what 
action they will take to challenge the ruling or what impact it will have on 
the state's beleaguered finances if it is upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould said the decision could be one factor that triggers deep cuts in all 
services.

SCIENTISTS GEAR UP FOR BIG BANG OF COMET, JUPITER; ASTRONOMY: AN ARMY OF SKY 
WATCHERS HAVE THEIR SIGHTS TRAINED ON THE PLANET. BUT THEY WON'T GET A DIRECT 
VIEW OF THE CELESTIAL COLLISION BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON THE DARK 
SIDE, OUT OF VIEW OF EARTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the fireworks flare on the far side of Jupiter on Saturday, astronomers 
around the world will be straining for an indirect glimpse of the collision 
between a comet and the solar system's largest planet, like someone outside the 
stadium trying to follow the Super Bowl by the roar of the crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 Scientists and amateur astronomers will be denied a direct look at the 
collision because the 21 or so fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 are expected 
to hit the planet's night side, which faces away from Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they will have to seek secondhand evidence of a once-in-a-lifetime 
celestial event: powerful ripples in the planet's thick atmosphere, 
disturbances in Jupiter's distinctive cloud patterns, bursts of interplanetary 
static caused by the impacts, and even the momentary glow from the explosive 
flashes reflected on Jupiter's many moons.  
</P>
<P>
 While it is a daunting challenge, astronomers say they are used to 
constructing their views of the universe from scant data. They have inferred 
the existence of planets outside the solar system by timing stellar static, 
detected a massive black hole by the speed of star systems swirling around it, 
and heard -- in the hum of background radiation -- the last faint echo of 
creation's Big Bang. 
</P>
<P>
 No astronomer has ever had a chance before to watch -- even indirectly -- when 
a comet slams into a planet, so professional and amateur observers are 
marshaling a global network of telescopes, airborne observatories and space 
probes throughout the solar system to capture hints of the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 The first piece of the fragmented comet is expected to hit Jupiter about 1 
p.m. PDT Saturday, experts predict, with the second hitting about sundown and 
the third just before midnight. Other chunks of the comet, traveling at 130,000 
m.p.h., are expected to rain on Jupiter for several days, with the last piece 
hitting early next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, the Griffith Observatory and the Los Angeles Astronomical 
Society are planning gatherings featuring Jupiter for amateur astronomers and 
the public. The observatory's main Zeiss telescope will be trained on Jupiter, 
and smaller telescopes will be set up on the grounds for public use Saturday. 
The Planetary Society is gathering at the Mt. Wilson Observatory.  
</P>
<P>
 For observatories in the Western United States, however, the most favorable 
viewing opportunities will not come until next week, well into the five-day 
bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 Comet experts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory predict that sky watchers in 
California will have their best viewing chances late Wednesday and Thursday 
evenings.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if the weather cooperates and the night skies are clear, viewing 
throughout North America will be limited because most of the impacts will occur 
during daylight or after Jupiter has set.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the actual impact will take place on Jupiter's dark side, the impact 
zone will rotate into view and be visible from Earth for about five hours after 
each hit.  
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers caution that no matter where on Earth an observer stands, there 
will be little visible to the naked eye or to most amateur telescopes. The 
Assn. of Lunar and Planetary Observers says that for the best results, amateurs 
should use a telescope with high-quality optics and at least a 10-inch 
aperture.  
</P>
<P>
 Some amateur astronomers, frustrated at not being able to see the collision 
directly, say they will hook up radios and listen to it instead. The U.S.-based 
Society of Amateur Radio Astronomers does not know what the crash will sound 
like, but is urging its members to tune in. 
</P>

 Jupiter normally emits radio waves at frequencies between 500 kilohertz and 40 
megahertz, which radio astronomers think are caused by electrons breaking free 
of a magnetic bond between the planet and its moon Io. 
</P>
<P>
 On an Earth-based short-wave radio, Jupiter's transmissions sound like waves 
crashing onto a beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers emphasized that the collisions should have no adverse effect on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no changes on Earth, except among a very excited group of 
astronomers," JPL comet expert Donald K. Yeomans said. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't sure what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier sightings of comets, such as Kohoutek in 1973 and Halley's comet's 
return in 1986, did not live up to public expectations.  
</P>
<P>
 Experts at the University of Arizona's Seward Observatory predict that the 
comet -- a "rubble pile" whose chunks are composed of hundreds, if not 
thousands, of small snowballs -- will disintegrate high in Jupiter's 
atmosphere, going out with a fizzle, not a noticeable bang.  
</P>
<P>
 Two reports in the science journal Nature this week suggest that the comet, in 
a deteriorating orbit around Jupiter and already torn to pieces by the planet's 
gravitational field, will disintegrate further before it plunges into Jupiter's 
atmosphere. The comet may produce a spectacular meteor shower, but no massive 
fireball. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Weismann, in JPL's Earth and Sciences Division, predicts a "cosmic 
fizzle." 
</P>
<P>
 A University of Chicago astrophysicist, on the other hand, predicts that the 
fragmented comet will create a spectacular plume of super-heated debris that 
will shoot hundreds of miles above Jupiter's multicolored clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 His conclusions are based on elaborate computer simulations of the impacts 
conducted at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Willy Benz, an astronomer at the University of Arizona, is optimistic. "Even 
if this impact is somewhat less spectacular than the media would like to have 
it, I believe that potentially much can be learned about the structure of 
comets and the circulation in Jupiter's atmosphere," he said. Slam-Dancing With

GAO FINDS NO TIE TO RAT, FIRES; PROBE: HOMEOWNERS CLAIMED LAW TO PROTECT THE 
HABITAT OF A RARE RODENT CONTRIBUTED TO THE WILDFIRE THAT DESTROYED THEIR 
HOMES. AGENCY SAYS REGULATIONS DID NOT WORSEN THE CONDITIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Federally mandated measures to protect a rare rodent in Southern California 
did not contribute to the destruction of 29 homes in an October blaze near 
Riverside, the General Accounting Office told lawmakers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding casts significant doubt on claims by some Riverside homeowners 
that rules barring a method of brush clearance called "disking" made their 
homes more vulnerable to fire by allowing flammable material to build up around 
the houses. The prohibition on disking was intended to protect the habitat of 
the Stephen's kangaroo rat, which is considered in danger of extinction under 
the federal Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners' claims, repeated in Washington by critics of the Endangered 
Species Act, had become a potent political charge against the landmark 
environmental statute, which has expired and is expected to be reauthorized 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, told lawmakers Thursday that 
"on the basis of the experience and views of fire officials and other experts . 
. . the loss of homes during the California fire was not related to the 
prohibition of disking in areas inhabited by the Stephen's kangaroo rat."  
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.), one of the lawmakers who asked for the inquiry, 
said that it should "quiet those who, in the aftermath of the fire, seized upon 
the personal tragedies of these California homeowners to advance their own 
agenda to eviscerate the Endangered Species Act." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Riverside) disagreed with the report's finding, saying 
that he rejects "the conclusion that the prohibition of disking does not appear 
related to the loss of homes. It completely defies logic to say that reducing 
the amount of combustible material around a structure does nothing to protect 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The kangaroo rat was not responsible for the fire destruction," he said. "It 
was man's overzealous regulations and interference with the rights of 
homeowners that was responsible for the damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The October, 1993, fire that sparked the exchange was one of 21 wildfires that 
raked California late in 1993. Fanned by tornado-like winds and fueled by acres 
of bone-dry tinder, it consumed about 25,000 acres and destroyed 29 homes, 
including 18 mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 GAO investigators, who interviewed county fire officials, local leaders and 
affected homeowners, said that winds, dry conditions and difficult terrain for 
firefighters appeared to seal the fate of the 29 homes. Certain homes were lost 
primarily because they were made with fire-prone materials and their owners 
kept trash and firewood nearby. In addition, a lack of steady power to pump 
water cost many people their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO found that the area surrounding some homes that were consumed by the 
fire had been disked to remove weeds and brush. But most of the homes burned 
showed no signs of weed abatement, the investigators said, even though the 
county regulations that prohibited disking allowed the clearance of weeds and 
brush by mowing and by hand.  
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1993, county officials agreed that homeowners should use the 
disking method, which effectively clears heavy weeds and brush but can gouge 
the soil beneath, within 100 yards of their homes. County fire officials, the 
Riverside County Habitat Conservation Agency and officials of the Interior 
Department's Fish and Wildlife Service are trying to negotiate an agreement 
that would provide for fire abatement measures, such as the clearance of dry 
brush, that would minimize adverse consequences to the kangaroo rat and its 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stephen's kangaroo rat, which lives in grasslands and sparse coastal sage 
scrub of western Riverside County and northern San Diego County, was listed as 
an endangered species in 1988. It is part of a unique family of rodents more 
loosely related to squirrels than to mice or rats. 
</P>
<P>
 Disking in the rat's habitat has been prohibited since 1989. While the policy 
was reviewed several times by local fire departments and questioned by 
homeowners, it remained in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief of Riverside County's Fire Department told investigators that "there 
were concerns within the Fire Department" about the ban on disking, but added 
that it raised no formal objections because it believed that allowing disking 
could open the county to litigation under the Endangered Species Act and that 
mowing would do as well in getting rid of flammable weeds.

NAVY BOARD RECOMMENDS DISCHARGE OF GAY OFFICER; MILITARY: LAWSUIT CHALLENGING 
CLINTON'S 'DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' POLICY IS EXPECTED. IT IS THE THIRD SUCH CASE 
TO BE DECIDED IN RECENT DAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 A Navy board of inquiry recommended Thursday that Lt. Tracy W. Thorne be 
discharged for declaring that he is a homosexual, paving the way for another 
likely court challenge to President Clinton's "don't ask, don't tell" policy on 
gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ruling still could be reversed by Navy Secretary John H. Dalton, 
Thorne and his lawyers said that they are preparing to file suit in federal 
district court here to challenge the policy on constitutional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's decision means that, no matter what the rhetoric, the reality is that 
(the military's treatment of homosexuals) is no different today than it was 
before" Clinton's new policy went into effect last December, Thorne told a news 
conference after the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed," he said, but added: "This is not an end. This is a 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's decision marks the third such case that Navy boards of inquiry have 
decided in recent days -- all under Clinton's new policy on gays in the 
military and all recommending honorable discharges. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, similar panels in Norfolk, Va., and Bangor, Wash., issued 
identical recommendations affecting Lt. (j.g.) R. Dirk Selland and Mark A. 
Phillips, a machinist's mate 2nd class, both of whom had declared that they 
were homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne's case was the most widely known, however, because the 27-year-old 
bombardier had disclosed his homosexuality on ABC-TV's "Nightline." The 
broadcast took place in May, 1992 -- four months after Clinton announced his 
new policy but 10 months before it took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton's new policy, the military no longer asks members of the armed 
forces to disclose their sexual orientation and ostensibly would allow them to 
continue serving if they kept their status to themselves and did not engage in 
homosexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rules also provide that merely disclosing that he or she is gay 
creates a "presumption" that a person has a "propensity" to engage in 
homosexual actions -- and therefore amounts to sufficient evidence for 
discharge from the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said that the only way a service member can overcome that is to 
present evidence that he or she is celibate. As a result, gay-rights groups 
have argued that in practical terms the new policy differs little from the 
outright ban on homosexuals that existed before. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne's situation and that of Selland, whose hearing was in Norfolk, have 
been regarded as ideal test cases because both officers had earned unusually 
high marks in their fitness reports and undoubtedly would have been kept on had 
they been heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Navy Capt. Douglas W. Cook, the inquiry board's president, pointed out 
that Thorne and his attorneys had "failed -- in fact made no effort -- to 
rebut" the presumption cited in the new policy rules. Indeed, Thorne admitted 
that he is living with another gay man now. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne had contended that, under the new regulations, he only could be 
discharged for homosexual conduct and he said his admission that he is gay does 
not in itself prove that he has engaged in such behavior. As a result, he 
declared, "there is nothing to rebut." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said that Thorne's lawyers hope to use the Navy ruling on the 
"presumptive rebuttal" clause to challenge the constitutionality of Clinton's 
new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Selland had notified his superiors in Norfolk that he was 
involved in a monogamous homosexual relationship with another gay man. The 
board in that case ruled that his admission that he was engaging in homosexual 
action constituted grounds for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton pledged during the 1992 presidential campaign to eliminate the ban 
that was in effect then on homosexuals serving in the armed forces but he ran 
into stiff opposition from Congress and the military and had to settle for a 
compromise that provided little real change. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate indication how quickly Dalton might complete his review 
of Thursday's decision by the three-member board of inquiry. A Pentagon 
spokesman said that the Defense Department would have no comment until the Navy 
secretary acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne said at his press conference that he still respects the Navy and wants 
to be a part of it but he criticized Clinton's new policy as ineffective. "I 
had hoped that the President's new policy would have meant what it said," he 
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that he plans to leave the Navy in October no matter what his 
status because he no longer is permitted to fly and believes that he has no 
real future in the sea service. "I'm an American, I'm a naval officer and I'm a 
gay man," he said in a summary speech on Wednesday.

CLINTON AIDES TAKE AIM AT DOLE IN HEALTH CARE BATTLE; STRATEGY: EFFORT IS AIMED 
AT FOCUSING ON CHOICE BETWEEN UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND INCREMENTAL REFORM. SOME 
OFFICIALS SEE RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Thursday unveiled its strategy for the next 
crucial phase of the battle over health care reform -- attack Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 For months, White House officials have writhed in frustration as the "Clinton 
plan" became a label that a majority of Americans reject, even as polls show 
many continue to support key elements of what Clinton has proposed: universal 
coverage, requirements that companies provide insurance to workers and cost 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Clinton and his aides have argued, has been that their plan was 
being measured not against competing proposals, but against each American's 
ideal of a perfect system. For White House officials, that problem was 
epitomized by the highly successful "Harry and Louise" television ads, which 
criticized Clinton's plan but, instead of offering a specific alternative, 
proclaimed only that "there must be a better way." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Administration officials do not believe that they can win a battle 
of "Bill Clinton versus Harry and Louise," they think they may be able to win 
"Bill Clinton versus Bob Dole." In talks with reporters, White House aides and 
Clinton advisers set about joining that battle with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dole-type proposals take care of the rich because they can always buy 
(insurance), take care of the poor because they have governmental programs that 
can take care of them, and leave the middle class in great jeopardy," White 
House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold M. Ickes told a group of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm took a similar line at a 
press conference called to unveil new Democratic health care ads. Dole's plan 
"offers no coverage for the middle class, controls no costs, . . . slashes 
health benefits for older Americans. It is a disaster for the middle class," 
Wilhelm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's plan, which has 39 other Senate Republicans as co-sponsors, would make 
changes in insurance rules, primarily by prohibiting certain discriminatory 
practices by insurance companies and ensuring coverage for those who have 
pre-existing medical conditions or who suddenly develop major illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would also provide subsidies to help some Americans buy insurance, 
although the subsidies would be less generous than those provided in various 
Democratic plans. Dole's plan would not include any requirement that everyone 
have insurance or that employers provide insurance to all workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and many outside experts have argued that ending the 
exemption for pre-existing conditions would not work unless the move is coupled 
with a requirement to cover all workers. If everyone knew they could buy 
insurance after getting sick, healthy people would have no incentive to have 
insurance, officials pointed out. Over time, the result would be that healthy 
people would drop coverage, driving up rates for everyone else, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Dole has argued that the Administration plan to cover everyone 
would require too much bureaucracy and impose too much of a burden on business, 
forcing companies to cut back on jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing on Dole carries obvious risks for the Administration, as Dole, 
himself, made clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're up here one day telling us they want our help with trade legislation. 
The next day they're having a press conference. And we're not going to 
cooperate if that's what they want to do," Dole said when asked about the White 
House attacks. "We're not going to do another NAFTA for them," he said, 
referring to the major role Republicans played in providing Clinton the votes 
to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat that Republicans will refuse to cooperate with the Administration, 
however, carries somewhat less sting than it might because the vast majority of 
Republicans consistently have opposed Clinton, except on trade. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been little indication that Republicans, who think Clinton is in 
political jeopardy, have much intention of cooperating with him on issues such 
as crime or health care, regardless of what happens on health. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Democratic congressional staff member voiced the concern about 
partisanship, saying that attacks on Dole are "not very helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 "It could just degenerate into presidential politics," he said, noting the 
possibility that Dole could seek the presidency in 1996. On the other hand, the 
aide acknowledged, attacking Dole's plan could in effect "force Democrats to 
choose up sides, though they may not be happy about having to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the risks, White House officials say they believe that focusing on 
Dole has the obvious advantage of placing a face -- and a relatively 
controversial one -- on the sort of incremental approach to health care reform 
that Clinton aides see as the biggest threat to their efforts at winning 
guaranteed coverage for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, officials said, is to focus public attention on the basic choice of 
guaranteed universal coverage versus incremental, non-universal reform. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Administration officials repeatedly have failed to find a way to shift 
the debate away from the perceived flaws of their own plan. Now, they believe, 
the dynamic will change as the action moves away from the welter of health 
plans offered by congressional committees toward a set of comparatively simple 
choices on the House and Senate floors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased that the committee process is over," Ickes said. "Now we can 
really join the debate." 
</P>
<P>
 The President, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and other senior officials 
plan an intensive effort during the next several weeks to push universal 
coverage. And, officials said, Clinton's senior economic advisers, including 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, will take a prominent role in that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 That could be significant because Bentsen and other members of the economic 
team, who have considerable clout in the business community and among 
congressional moderates, have kept a low profile in the health care debate 
until now.

got out of his car to check on a girl he had just hit. 
</P>

POLITICS; BRAZIL'S LEADING CANDIDATE LOSES MOMENTUM; PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIZ 
INACIO LULA DA SILVA FIGHTS TO AVOID A RUNOFF. HIS IMAGE IS THREATENED BY A 
SCANDAL SURROUNDING HIS CHOICE OF RUNNING MATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when it appeared that Brazilian presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula 
da Silva and his signature campaign "Caravans" were steamrollering through the 
countryside toward the nation's capital with hardly a bump in sight, the wheels 
have started coming off the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Little more than a week ago, Lula, a union leader, grade-school dropout and 
former metalworker, was riding a huge lead in the polls and appeared close to 
capturing the Oct. 3 election with more than half the vote, thus avoiding a 
dangerous November runoff with his closest rival, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent series of campaign blunders, a resurgence by Cardoso and the 
possible resignation of Lula's vice presidential choice amid a sea of 
controversy have stopped the candidate in his tracks. His party finds itself 
mired in damage control just as the race enters its most crucial phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Most damaging is the controversy surrounding Lula's vice presidential choice, 
Jose Paulo Bisol, a senator who offered to resign Wednesday following press 
reports of shady bank loans and attempted influence-peddling in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian voters are keenly interested in their vice presidential candidates, 
since for seven of the past 10 years, vice presidents have governed in place of 
those who led their tickets. In 1984, Vice President Jose Sarney became 
president, serving five years, when Tancredo Neves died before assuming office. 
The current president, Itamar Franco, assumed the top post during 1992 
impeachment proceedings against Fernando Collor de Mello, who resigned.  
</P>
<P>
 A former judge and state legislator from the southern state of Rio Grande do 
Sul, Bisol had touted himself as a "Mr. Clean." He was involved in Collor's 
impeachment and used his chairmanship of a Senate subcommittee to crusade 
against fellow federal legislators implicated in a massive, national budget 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent news reports have destroyed that facade, smearing Lula's pristine image 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports charge that as a state judge in 1981, Bisol and his fellow 
magistrates entered into an agreement with a local bank to deposit millions of 
escrow money with the bank, exempting the bank from having to make the normal 
adjustments to match the nation's rampant inflation rate, then 50% annually. In 
return, the bank gave the judges a series of loans with interest rates so low 
that they were essentially gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The news stories also allege that later, as a state legislator and then 
senator, Bisol received a series of questionable low-interest loans, many of 
them unsecured, for equipment and construction on his farm in the state of 
Minas Gerais. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, and most damning, Bisol tried this year to sneak an amendment into 
the federal budget for extensive construction of roads and a bridge next to his 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula's opponents, nearly all of them from parties already tainted by one or 
another of the country's many scandals, have jumped at the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bisol episode shows that the Workers' Party is moralist only in words, 
not in deeds," said Orestes Quercia, a presidential candidate who is currently 
facing criminal charges for his dealings when governor of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bisol affair comes right on the heels of a disastrous campaign swing 
through Minas Gerais where Lula was picketed by members of his own party and 
where radio announcers, upset that the candidate had canceled interviews, urged 
residents to stay home.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Cardoso, who when he was finance minister devised the country's new 
economic plan, has received a favorable bounce in the polls as Lula's numbers 
have begun to dip slightly. The Bisol debacle, political analysts say, makes a 
runoff a near-certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hurt us, there's no question about it," said a ranking Lula staffer, 
part of the team that may soon be selecting a new vice presidential candidate. 
"But it came at a good time. Right now, everybody is interested in the World 
Cup. Hopefully we can recoup when the campaign really starts in August." 
</P>
<P>
 That is when the candidates will begin to receive free, federally mandated 
campaign time on national television.

INDIA; ACTOR'S ARREST ON WEAPONS CHARGES THREATENS 'BOLLYWOOD'

 Now playing: a real-life, multimillion-dollar horror show for the Indian film 
industry, starring one of its biggest names. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama's ending will tell a great deal about how justice is administered in 
this country, and may reveal who was behind one of the most diabolical 
terrorist attacks in Indian history. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, a Bombay judge sent Sanjay Dutt, the country's muscular, 
home-grown answer to Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone, back to jail, 
revoking his bail. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the beginning of an all-too-real nightmare for the magnates, producers 
and financiers of Hindi films and for their bookkeepers. According to industry 
sources, Dutt is currently involved in the production of at least 15 movies in 
which $13 million has been invested. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaggy-haired, 35-year-old macho actor is accused of illegally purchasing 
and possessing three AK-56 assault rifles and ammunition for them. Arrested in 
April, 1993, he was granted interim bail after a brief imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged suppliers of the rifles were the underworld dons blamed for the 
March, 1993, serial bombings that, by official count, killed 257 people and 
seriously wounded more than 730 others in Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutt's father, a former movie star, now sits in India's Parliament. His late 
mother, Nargis, is held to be the greatest goddess to have ever graced the 
Hindi-language screen. In this country, that combination of pedigree and 
influence usually would be enough in most situations to lead to a bending of 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge J.N. Patel, who had to decide whether to continue Dutt's bail, 
refused to give the hulking, dark-eyed VIP from "Bollywood," the Bombay-based 
film industry, a break. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutt's lawyers pinned their hopes on an appeal to the Supreme Court. Veteran 
director-producer Prakash Mehra said if that gambit failed, the Bollywood 
moguls, in the guise of the Film Makers Combine, would petition the high court 
for Dutt's release on "humanitarian" grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This judgment has left the film industry emotionally hurt, apart from the 
huge losses that they are going to suffer," Mehra said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the fault of the producers? They should be allowed to complete the 
unfinished films." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutt's legal predicament is particularly sticky because he is charged under a 
tough Indian anti-terrorism law that requires a judge to keep him in jail 
unless there is a reasonable doubt of his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The actor admits buying the rifles, but says he kept only one, plus some 
ammunition, because he was worried about the communal violence that erupted in 
1992 in Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubbish, Patel said. He accused the actor of being "fully aware" that a huge 
quantity of arms and explosives had been smuggled into India by the alleged 
mastermind of the Bombay bombings, Dubai-based crime lord Dawood Ibrahim, and 
his associates. Some of the accused even claim that Dutt allowed the storage of 
the terrorists' arsenal at his residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision requires the actor be jailed until the Bombay bombing 
trial, which began Thursday, is over. 
</P>
<P>
 In opening arguments, the prosecution claimed the 193 accused planned 
follow-up attacks in New Delhi, Calcutta and other cities. The purported scheme 
to destabilize India was allegedly hatched with Pakistan's help, or at its 
instigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A former drug addict, Dutt has led a troubled and well-publicized private 
life. His fans will now be watching to learn whether the title of his last 
box-office hit, "Khalnayak" -- "The Villain" -- is a coincidence or an apt 
description of its star.

INDIA'S LEADER SHOWS STAYING POWER; ASIA: PRIME MINISTER RAO, ONCE DISMISSED AS 
A LIGHTWEIGHT, MARKS THREE YEARS IN POWER AND TICKS OFF ACHIEVEMENTS DURING 
RALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Under a broiling sun, Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, once dismissed as a 
gentle political elder without ambition, celebrated the accomplishments of his 
first three years in office Thursday with a huge open-air rally. 
</P>
<P>
 When he assumed power, he said, India had been plunged into "darkness" by the 
brutal assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister. "Nobody knew 
what to do," Rao recalled. "The country was divided, both socially and 
politically." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Rao told a parched crowd at Delhi's sprawling Red Fort, it is as 
if India had been refreshed by the life-giving rains of the monsoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The most clement weather has not yet arrived, Rao said, speaking in terms even 
the simplest farmer could understand. "But you will find that there has been an 
overall improvement in the situation, I mean of the 900-million population and 
the country," he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's event was an apotheosis of sorts for the soft-spoken former 
foreign, home and defense minister who became India's ninth head of government 
on June 21, 1991, and who, as leader of the party that Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira 
Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi also belonged to, seemed then not to be in the same 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 But the South Indian's staying power and shrewd mastery of political 
infighting have impressed many. It was only in December that the defection of 
some opposition lawmakers gave Rao and his Congress-I Party a majority in the 
Lok Sabha, Parliament's lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we have a majority government, and there is stability in the country," 
Rao, 73, said in his rambling speech, which lasted for more than an hour and a 
half as his audience sweated. 
</P>
<P>
 The venue was one carefully chosen for its links to great events -- the 
Mogul-built fort of red sandstone where Nehru, another Congress prime minister, 
proclaimed the independence of India in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all has been rosy for Rao of late, however. As he and his finance 
minister, Manmohan Singh, try to scrap decades of bureaucratic control over the 
economy, India's inflation rate has crept back into double-digit territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The police and armed forces have proven incapable of defeating the Muslim 
insurrection in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Relations with neighboring 
Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir as its own, are the worst in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister suffered a humiliating reversal on the domestic scene last 
month when he and Congress failed to marshal the necessary two-thirds majority 
in Parliament to reduce the powers of the ferociously independent election 
commissioner, T. N. Seshan. 
</P>
<P>
 Special trains and buses brought people from throughout India to Thursday's 
rally, which was organized by the All-India Congress-I Committee. The sandy 
ground by the fort's parapets was transformed into a glittering tapestry of 
India's varied populace as turbaned and barefoot Punjabis, small men clad in 
white loincloths from the southern state of Kerala and matrons in saris from 
Delhi's most exclusive neighborhoods mingled by the tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress leaders predicted that 1 million people would turn out, but 
attendance appeared nowhere near that. Many in the crowd obviously didn't 
understand Hindi, the language Rao used in his speech, and thousands streamed 
toward the exits as he talked. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of New Delhi was decked out in the saffron, green and white that are the 
Congress' -- and India's -- colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Milking the legacy of the party that led the independence struggle for all it 
was worth, organizers had set up the same sort of giant cutouts used to 
advertise movies, this time showing Rao with past prime ministers and with 
Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was once Congress president. 
</P>
<P>
 At traffic circles, cutouts of a smiling Rajiv Gandhi, who was killed May 21, 
1991, by a suicide bomber waved eerily at motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Gandhi's assassination, and the refusal of his Italian-born widow, 
Sonia, to succeed him as party president during national elections that led 
Congress leaders to ask Rao to take the job. Rao then seemed to many a safe 
stopgap solution; it was assumed that one of the party's regional powerbrokers 
would take control later. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rao proved as skillful in neutralizing his rivals inside Congress as in 
blunting the challenge mounted by the main opposition group, the Hindu 
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which was routed in last autumn's state 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rao appeared in his booth of bulletproof glass shortly after noon, many 
people had already been in the sun for hours. As the temperature neared 100, 
some fainted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rao said somewhat apologetically that, if the rally had been held last month 
on the actual anniversary date, it would have been even hotter. To wait till 
the cool weather of autumn, he said, would be to risk accusations that the 
event was nothing but a vote-getting ploy for the upcoming elections in 10 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Congress leader didn't make a delicate play for voters' support. 
Rao asked Indians to devote a "year of thinking" to the next elections for the 
national Parliament.

RWANDA'S TUTSI REBELS ROUT HUTU-LED ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ad vancing Tutsi rebels routed what remained of the Hutu-led Rwandan army 
Thursday, closing in on a complete military takeover after three months of 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 A swift thrust by troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front into the last pocket 
of government-held territory broke army defenses, scattered the rump government 
and sent a quarter-million Hutu refugees swarming across Rwanda's border into 
eastern Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The tidal wave of humanity, which began late Wednesday, peaked Thursday with 
hundreds of refugees arriving each minute at the small Zairian border town of 
Goma, overwhelming the few relief agency officials on hand and raising fears of 
a new humanitarian tragedy in a region already devastated by tribal 
bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 France called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss 
the building crisis and what a statement in Paris said was urgent need for a 
cease-fire between rebels and government troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials said the flood of refugees was continuing unabated and might 
dwarf the last great refugee exodus out of Rwanda. In a 24-hour period in 
April, a quarter-million Rwandans, mostly Hutus, crossed the country's eastern 
border at Ngara, Tanzania. What is considered the world's largest refugee camp 
was set up at Benaco to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ngara will look like a picnic compared to this lot," Patrick Fuller of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross said of the latest refugee flood.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hutu refugees are fleeing not just the fighting but also what they fear 
will be reprisals by the Tutsi rebel force for the slaughter of hundreds of 
thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus since a suspicious plane crash April 6 
killed Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana. 
</P>
<P>
 A government led by Hutu extremists proclaimed power after Habyarimana's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rwandan army steadily lost ground to advancing rebels, and last month 
France sent a peacekeeping force to protect civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, the rebels seized the last big Hutu garrison, Ruhengeri in 
northern Rwanda, news reports said.

PLO FOOT SOLDIERS LEFT IN DUST OF SELF-RULE; MIDEAST: AS ARAFAT SETS UP SHOP IN 
GAZA, MEN WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO STRUGGLE FEEL NEGLECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ahmed Abdul Karim Hih still has the look of a brawny mountain fighter, which 
he is, and his thick muscled arm seemed out of place raising a Coke beside a 
swimming pool in this drowsy town astride the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat had just boarded a 
plane for the Gaza Strip, and Hih was one of the assortment of former fighters, 
disgruntled bureaucrats and budding opposition leaders left behind this week at 
what was -- but no longer is -- PLO headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hih hasn't been paid since March for his work in the PLO political department. 
If he gets an order to go to Gaza, as he expects, he can't take his Tunisian 
wife and two children; he will have no way to provide for them to stay here. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, Ziyad, climbed out of the club pool and asked when the family can buy 
a swim membership so he can play every day. He melted under Hih's glare. "I 
know," the boy said. "When you get your salary. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 His father then observed: "I paid more than a quarter of my life, side by 
side, with Arafat from Jordan to Lebanon to Syria to Tunis. 
</P>
<P>
 "What to say to my children now -- that I am going to be a policeman? At this 
age?" asked Hih, 45. "After 26 years of fighting in the mountains with machine 
guns, with hand grenades, with rockets, now I am nothing. And when I talk about 
myself, I am talking about my whole generation. We created this man with our 
struggle so he is a hero, and we are nothing. Really, I would rather die than 
see these results." 
</P>
<P>
 These resentful men, left behind in Tunis, are supposed to be carrying on the 
work of the PLO outside the territories, maintaining contacts with the 70 
nations that have recognized the State of Palestine, lobbying for the return of 
Palestinian refugees and pursuing the peace process with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also represent a potential political time bomb for Arafat, who has 
cast his lot in the West Bank and Gaza Strip at the expense of millions of 
Palestinians scattered around the Arab world and the rest of the globe who have 
no stake in what happens in the self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 The three senior department chiefs who will remain in Tunis -- foreign 
minister Farouk Kaddoumi at the political department, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu 
Maazen) in international relations and Abdullah Hourani in charge of refugees 
-- have stood against Arafat to varying degrees in the past year as the PLO 
chairman has embarked on his "Gaza-Jericho first" peace initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaddoumi, who initially opposed the peace accord, has since begun working to 
implement it but has made no secret that he doesn't like it and doesn't have 
much faith that it will lead to the goal of an independent Palestinian state 
with Jerusalem as its capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered the most likely successor to Arafat for the PLO leadership, 
Kaddoumi has been left to nurture a power base of millions of disenfranchised 
Palestinians. Already this week he was making strident statements -- calling 
for a continuation of armed struggle against Israel -- which do not strictly 
adhere to the PLO chairman's line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intifada (the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation) should 
continue as long as the Israelis are there, because they have postponed all 
their promises," Kaddoumi said in an interview this week in his Tunis office. 
"The deal was that they should withdraw completely from Gaza. They did not 
withdraw. So they are big liars. I don't think this will serve the cause of 
peace. And if they think they can deceive us, in the long run, they are the big 
losers." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he endorsed a recent attack on an Israeli soldier by the 
fundamentalist Palestinian group, Hamas, Kaddoumi said he supported such moves, 
as long as they occur outside the Palestinian self-rule areas of Gaza and 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamas attacks against Israeli soldiers are still legitimate in the West Bank 
-- and it's not Hamas. Why do you always say Hamas? It is the Palestinian 
people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . We seek peace," he said. "But the oppressed people should have the 
right to resist occupation by all means." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Arafat agreed with this line, Kaddoumi smiled. "Ask Arafat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the troupes of Israelis who have traveled to Tunis in recent months -- 
most recently a delegation headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin to 
multilateral peace talks -- Kaddoumi, even as PLO foreign minister, has refused 
to meet with any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no confidence in the Israelis. . . . I'm skeptical of their attitude," 
he said. " . . . Israel in two months should move out of the remaining 
territories of the West Bank. We should see to it also that they withdraw their 
settlers, and Jerusalem must be the capital of the state of Palestine. 
Palestinian refugees should be repatriated to their homeland, whether it is to 
the state of Palestine or in Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kaddoumi is inextricably linked to the Gaza-Jericho plan as chairman of 
the board of governors of the economic and development authority that will 
finance reconstruction and channel international aid. He has insisted on the 
right to sign every check, every contract. With each signature, his power 
inside and outside the territories mounts, even as he has acted as a forceful, 
effective spokesman to attract international donations for Palestinian 
self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be one of Arafat's most difficult tasks in the months ahead to channel 
the doubts and frustrations left over in Tunis toward concrete progress on 
Palestinian self-rule. Before departing this week, he emphasized that the PLO 
hierarchy remains the basis of the Palestinian cause, despite the induction of 
the new Palestinian Authority for governing the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 But PLO troops outside Gaza are flagging. Staffing must be cut at PLO 
embassies around the world and some offices will be closed, as the bulk of 
whatever new money comes in is channeled to Gaza and Jericho, Kaddoumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tunis, remaining employees still await final lists to determine whether 
they will be asked to take new jobs -- mostly as police -- in Gaza and Jericho. 
Those on the list must go or they won't be paid. Yet most have no idea where 
they would live in Gaza or how their families would be provided for. Even those 
remaining in Tunis face uncertain futures. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little of the peace euphoria, so evident still in Gaza's streets, in 
the emptying Palestinian villas here with disconnected telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our government is pushing us to go outside this place we have been living in 
for 12 years," Hih said. "To deport us as men. To leave our families here. For 
how long? We don't know. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He shrugged. "Arafat has gone to Gaza, and I cannot get anyone to give me an 
answer about my salary and my future."

RAVAGED MONTEZUMA GIVES BLEAK PICTURE OF HOW FLOOD BATTERED DEPRESSED TOWNS; 
DELUGE: RESIDENTS FIND HOMES AND BUSINESSES AWASH IN MUD. BOUNCING BACK FROM 
THE DAMAGE WILL BE A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Yancey Hill was a boy it seemed the creeks rose every year and flooded 
Montezuma. His dog would stand in the water downtown catching fish between its 
teeth. Men in hats plied Main Street in canoes. A levee built on Beaver Creek 
in 1954 stopped the yearly floods. But the area's dam and levee system couldn't 
stand up to the barrage of water that surged through last week in the worst 
flooding Georgia has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Dams burst, spewing filthy, brown water that coursed through town after 
luckless town along the Flint, Ocmulgee and Chattahoochee rivers. It swirled 
through houses, snatched up people and cars, washed away livelihoods and lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill rushed downtown with an employee and two friends when he realized that 
the flood threatened merchandise in his department store. "When we got here the 
water was lapping at the back door," the 70-year-old merchant said this week as 
helpers padded cautiously through the smelly sludge, trying to salvage what 
they could. In less than 45 minutes the water chased them away. "When we 
decided we'd better get out, it was waist high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The waters are receding now in the ravaged, mud-caked towns of southwest 
Georgia. People have started warily returning to their homes to assess the 
damage. No dollar figures have yet been assigned to the flood's widespread 
devastation. But to understand what the flood means to the hundreds of 
thousands whose lives have been disrupted, it is necessary only to look at its 
effects here in Montezuma, a depressed agricultural community of 4,500 people 
beside the Flint River southwest of Macon. 
</P>
<P>
 It is safe to say that Georgia has not seen such a swath of destruction since 
Sherman's troops marched to the sea in the War Between the States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been a part of anything like this, experienced anything like this 
or seen anything like this in my life, and I'm 70 years old," said Preston 
Williams, Montezuma's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The central business district, hardly thriving before, today looks like a war 
zone. Helicopters whir overhead. National Guard troops man barricades to keep 
out the curious. All 50 businesses downtown were closed by the flooding; water 
marks inside some buildings are almost 10 feet high. Water forced gas tanks at 
the service station to pop out of the earth, leaving deep craters in the ground 
as if a bomb had struck. 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as anyone can remember, most businesses here shut at noon on 
Wednesdays. Folks went fishing or golfing or just home to relax. But Wednesday 
afternoon, the town was busy digging out of the devastation. Bulldozers and 
dump trucks cleared debris as workers emptied businesses of spoiled treasures. 
Generators roared, supplying meager light inside ransacked buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the middle of all that, courtly even covered in grime, was 
gray-haired Yancey Hill, surveying what was left of the department store 
founded by his grandfather, a former mayor and one of Montezuma's most 
substantial early citizens. Hill's whole life revolved around that store, even 
though he and his wife, Nancy, lately have opened it only on weekends. He had 
gone to work there as a child. It is full of ancient furnishings and memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everything in the store was soaked in dirty water. Hill and his wife 
and friends are recovering merchandise and washing it to see what can be 
salvaged. Two Laundromats have agreed to stay open late so that he can use all 
of the machines. A dry cleaner also is working overtime. He is hoping against 
hope that he will be able to sell the washed and pressed clothing when the 
store reopens. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Hill's sister, Rachel Thomas, drove to Montezuma from her 
home in Atlanta to help clean up. She was haunted, she said, by the image of 
her brother standing on the tiles laid in the doorway of the store. The tiles 
spelled out Hill's and their grandfather's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him standing there with mud all over him," she said. "There was mud 
everywhere. It just made me want to cry." 
</P>
<P>
 After having spent sleepless nights worrying, Hill said he is resigned to the 
possibility that he might have to shut down. The thought pains him, and he 
won't do it without a fight -- he swears he won't leave his creditors hanging 
-- but how could he not consider the possibility. No one downtown was insured 
for flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll take hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix up this place, then 
restock it," Nancy Hill said. "We're too old -- we can't go into debt. There's 
been a Hill's Department Store here before anybody can remember, since 1887. 
But if we don't get some sort of help we're going to be in real serious 
straits." 
</P>
<P>
 In two big ways Montezuma is typical of the communities ravaged by the flood: 
First, with the exception of Macon and Albany, which are sizable towns, the 
area hardest hit is relatively sparsely populated. They are already 
economically depressed communities that have little industry other than 
agriculture. Although this means the losses here are much less than they likely 
would have been had the floods hit the more developed northern portion of the 
state, it also means that bouncing back will be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the destructive force of the water was magnified by the failure of 
area dams. Officials blame nearly half of the 31 flood-related deaths in the 
state on breaks that occurred in a series of unregulated earthen dams. Although 
no one was killed in Macon County, where Montezuma is located, 15 people died 
just south in Sumter County. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the death of one person in Alabama, 32 people in all have died in 
the floods. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, the mayor, said the town was struck twice -- once when 13 inches of 
rain fell on already saturated earth, causing a flash flood as swollen 
waterways east of town burst through a dam, sending torrents of water flowing 
through Montezuma. As if that weren't enough, the town flooded again later when 
the Flint River west of town spilled over its banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike downriver, where communities in southernmost Georgia and the Florida 
Panhandle had days to get ready for rivers to crest, no one in Montezuma had 
time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bainbridge, for example, people had been bracing for more than a week for 
the river to crest Thursday. They got a reprieve, however, when the river 
crested lower than predicted, sparing the town the total disaster for which 
officials had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montezuma, the river crest came a day before it was predicted, and no one 
expected a dam to burst. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hill arrived at his store Wednesday morning of last week, just before the 
deluge, he and his helpers frantically started carrying merchandise to a 
storeroom upstairs. After 10 or 15 minutes, when they saw how fast the water 
was rising, they began pitching stock onto the tops of cabinets and high 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1929, during the 100-year flood everyone in these parts talks about and 
that Hill still remembers, the water rose 16 inches inside the store. The water 
mark inside the store now is more than nine feet high. Everything except the 
few items they managed to get upstairs got soaked. "This isn't a 100-year 
flood," he said. "This is maybe a 500-year-flood to say the least."

HOUSE BACKS LINE-ITEM VETO, IN SETBACK TO TOP DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The House dealt a defeat to its Democratic leaders on Thursday, voting 
overwhelmingly to bolster the President's ability to kill individual pork 
barrel projects and tax breaks buried in huge bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers ignored pleas from top Democrats that the measure would tip too much 
power toward the executive branch and chose it over a weaker Democratic version 
by a 298-121 roll call. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was probably symbolic because opponents in the Senate, led by Sen. 
Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), have kept similar legislation from coming to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tally represented an unusual election year victory for House deficit 
hawks of both parties as the chamber begins a series of votes on budget issues. 
</P>
<P>
 It also put President Clinton in an embarrassing position. During last year's 
campaign, he supported a tough version of the measure, called a line-item veto, 
but has since backed a weaker version by congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to end the spending bias and put the bias in favor of reducing the 
deficit," said Rep. Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.), who sponsored the successful 
measure with Reps. Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.) and John R. Kasich (R-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would require Congress to vote on a President's proposals for 
canceling individual spending items, called rescissions. Currently, lawmakers 
can kill such proposals by simply not voting on them. 
</P>
<P>
 It also would let the President propose eliminating narrow tax breaks for 
specific people or businesses included in revenue bills. The President cannot 
now try to kill individual items in tax legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders had offered a weaker alternative, but it died when 
lawmakers approved the stronger measure. Under it, for the rest of this year 
only, Congress would have voted on the President's proposal to cut an 
individual spending item if he issued his proposal within three days of signing 
the overall measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidents now must either sign or veto entire spending bills and cannot 
eliminate individual items in them. They can propose to cancel individual 
spending projects, but their proposals do not take effect unless the House and 
Senate approve them within 45 days.

WOMAN, 4 CHILDREN KILLED AT STOCKTON RAILROAD CROSSING; TRAGEDY: PENNEY CORONA, 
27, OF LODI APPARENTLY WAS TRYING TO RACE THE TRAIN DESPITE WARNING GATES AND 
LIGHTS. OFFICIALS SAY THERE WAS NOTHING THE ENGINEER COULD DO TO AVOID THE 
CRASH.

 A Lodi woman and four children were killed Thursday morning when the woman, 
apparently ignoring a lowered crossing gate and flashing lights, drove into the 
path of a 4,000-ton Union Pacific freight train near Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred when Penney Corona, 27, tried to race the train across 
the tracks on her way home after dropping off her boyfriend at work, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead children included Corona's two daughters, Natosha, 7, and Kayla, 6. 
Also killed were Mistie L. Martindale, 7, and Altina M. Martindale, 6, the 
daughters of Corona's boyfriend, Brian Martindale. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the four children were thrown about 30 feet from the station wagon 
after the train dragged the car 360 feet down the tracks and deposited it on an 
embankment, California Highway Patrol Officer Bob Whitmire said. 
</P>
<P>
 All five victims died at the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision came at 7:52 a.m., when Corona, traveling east on Eight Mile 
Road, maneuvered around two cars and the lowered crossing gate into the 
westbound lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses say she hesitated momentarily at the tracks, then accelerated in 
front of the mile-long train, which was barreling toward the crossing at nearly 
60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The train, which was 100 to 150 feet away when Corona approached the crossing, 
smashed into the right side of the station wagon, Whitmire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to witnesses, the crossing arms came down, the warning lights were 
flashing and bells ringing. The train's headlamp was on and its horn was 
sounding," Whitmire said. "The engineer did see the car approach, but lost 
sight of it and then felt the impact." 
</P>
<P>
 The crash scattered debris, including broken glass and transmission parts, 
over several hundred feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty gruesome scene," said Whitmire, who said the wreck was one of 
the worst he had seen in his 26-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP and Union Pacific officials said there was nothing the train engineer 
could have done to avoid the crash. The train was hauling a cargo of new cars.

4 MEN MAY HAVE DIED IN BOAT SINKING ; ACCIDENT: AUTHORITIES HAVE RECOVERED 
BODIES OF ONLY TWO FISHERMEN. ONE OF THE OTHER VICTIMS APPARENTLY WAS THE BOAT 
OWNER, WHO SPENT $30,000 MAKING CRAFT SEAWORTHY.

<P>
 The Coast Guard said Thursday that four men may have died off Newport Beach in 
the apparent sinking of a San Pedro fishing boat whose owner recently spent 
$30,000 to fix up. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men were thought to be fishing with gill nets aboard a 45-foot vessel 
named Tammy, which disappeared in a busy shipping lane early this week. The 
bodies of two men -- Nhieu Van Nguyen, 52, a licensed fisherman from El Monte, 
and Khanh Nguyen, 50, of Alhambra -- were recovered amid boat debris Tuesday 
morning. The discovery set off a one-day air and sea search by the Coast Guard, 
but the vessel and the other two bodies have not been found. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat's owner, Cong Minh Ta, 54, of San Gabriel is missing and presumed 
dead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities on Thursday identified the fourth man as Gioi Nguyen, 59, of San 
Pedro, a sometimes fishing partner of the other victims whose son reported him 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims were related, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities sought answers to the disappearance of the craft, relatives and 
fellow seamen described commercial gill net fishing as a poorly paid life spent 
aboard rickety boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Tighter regulations have heightened competition among gill net fishermen, who 
string long nets behind their boats to catch fish and sea cucumbers. Officials 
say many of the estimated 300 fishing boats docked in Los Angeles Harbor are 
poorly maintained, lacking good lighting or navigational equipment for work 
that often goes on at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the average they're in really bad shape," said Coast Guard Petty Officer 
Randy Reid. "Just being on board for a short time, I'm always worried for my 
safety -- wondering whether it's going to sink." 
</P>
<P>
 Nhieu Van Nguyen, whose body was spotted by a private boater Tuesday, knew the 
perils as well as anyone. He escaped with a broken rib when a boat he owned 
sank three years ago after being struck by a steamer, friends and relatives 
said. Nguyen was listed as a skipper for two other net-fishing boats. Both sank 
this year, although he was not aboard, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nhieu was fishing for his whole life," said younger brother Kieu Nguyen, 34, 
of San Gabriel. "When we came here, I told him I could get him another job, 
doing gardening or cleaning. But he said, 'No. Only fishing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tammy should have been different. 
</P>
<P>
 After buying the 30-year-old steel-hull vessel last fall, Ta poured thousands 
of dollars into building it into a boat suitable for gill net fishing. Nhieu 
Nguyen was always at his side. During the repairs, a Coast Guard inspector 
cited Ta for leaking diesel fuel into the harbor and an inspector who went 
aboard the docked boat had urged him to stop welding because the boat lacked 
working fire extinguishers. Work on the boat was finished last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They worked on the boat for about six months," said Liem Nguyen, 21, Nguyen's 
only daughter. "He thought it was just like new." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with Vietnamese tradition, Kieu Nguyen will hang a picture of his 
older brother beside the Buddha, incense and fruit in his San Gabriel house 
after Saturday's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The two brothers left Nha Trang, a city northeast of Saigon known for its 
exquisite beaches, about 12 years ago and came to California. Their father was 
a fisherman who regularly took his sons on fishing trips in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Liem Nguyen, joined her father in the United States in 1988. But Nhieu 
Nguyen's wife remained in Vietnam because the family did not have enough money 
to bring her to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my heart, I want to see my mother, but it depends on the money," Liem 
Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kieu Nguyen said he had not seen his brother in about three weeks and learned 
of his death through television reports. Most recently, Nhieu Nguyen lived in 
El Monte, but he often stayed with friends elsewhere in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I didn't know where he was staying," Kieu Nguyen said. "But if I 
wanted to see him, I'd just go to the docks."

CALTRANS TO RAZE HALF-FINISHED BRIDGE THAT RESIDENTS OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time ever, Caltrans officials have agreed to demolish a 
half-finished project that had sparked furious community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the Santa Ana school board, the state Department of 
Transportation this week agreed to dismantle the half-finished pedestrian 
bridge over the Santa Ana Freeway, spending $60,000 to undo $600,000 worth of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of residents on the well-manicured northeast side of the bridge had 
aggressively opposed the project in recent months, fearing that the bridge 
would be a conduit for criminals who live on the west side to cross over onto 
their placid streets. The bridge was supposed to replace a pedestrian tunnel 
that closed last year while the freeway was widened. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the children who would have used the bridge to get to school on the 
northeast side of the freeway now will have to take the bus, the school 
district may have to come up with an estimated $80,000 a year for busing.

MANDELA RETURNS HOME AFTER CATARACT SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Nelson Mandela went home for a week of rest Thursday after cataract 
surgery complicated by eye damage from his years breaking rocks as a prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, who turns 76 on Monday, said before the surgery Wednesday that he 
expected to miss only a day of work. 
</P>
<P>
 But a form of conjunctivitis that destroyed his tear glands made the 
three-hour procedure on Mandela's left eye "very difficult" and kept surgeons 
from working on his right eye, Dr. Percy Amoils said. Surgery on the right eye 
will be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Smashing limestone rocks at Robben Island prison for nearly two decades caused 
the tear-gland damage, his surgeons said.

S. KOREA BANS VISITS TO KIM'S FUNERAL; ASIA: BUT NORTH SAYS IT WELCOMES SUCH 
TRIPS. PYONGYANG ADDS THAT CITIZENS FROM THE SOUTH HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED.

 South Korea on Thursday banned visits by its citizens to attend the funeral of 
North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, while North Korea announced it would welcome 
such visits and revealed that a prominent South Korean already had arrived in 
Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Hi Pak, a close assistant to the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, founder of the 
Unification Church, was shown on North Korean television arriving at Pyongyang 
airport Wednesday. Korean American journalist Myung Ja Julie Moon and two 
pastors, identified as Kim Jin Kyung and Hong Dong Keun, accompanied Pak, who 
is also president of the Seoul-based Segye (World) Times, a daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a virulent foe of the Kim Il Sung government and a passionate advocate of 
anti-communism, the Rev. Moon, who lives in the United States, met Kim in 
Pyongyang in November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Segye newspaper reported that Pak traveled through Beijing to North Korea 
to attend Sunday's funeral for Kim and have an exclusive interview with Kim 
Jong Il, 52, son and heir apparent of the late North Korean dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 Pak, an American resident who holds South Korean citizenship, fulfilled a 
South Korean legal requirement by reporting his plan to visit Pyongyang on 
Wednesday at the South Korean Embassy in Beijing, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
 With its announcement Thursday, the Seoul government served notice that 
citizens reporting plans to visit North Korea for the funeral will be denied 
permission. In announcing Saturday its plans for the funeral, North Korea said 
it would not allow foreigners to attend but until Thursday had said nothing 
about visits by Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korean media also reported that another assistant of the Rev. Moon had 
sent a message of condolences to North Korea along with word that Moon wants to 
meet Kim Jong Il. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seoul, university students staged early morning attacks on eight police 
stands and one police station to protest the arrest Wednesday of 55 student 
leaders for praising Kim Il Sung. The Korea University Students Assn. 
reportedly plans to send its own delegate to attend the funeral in Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 By approving leaves Thursday for enlisted troops, South Korea's Defense 
Ministry, in effect, lifted an alert of the nation's 625,000 armed forces that 
it ordered immediately after the announcement of Kim Il Sung's death. The 
37,000 American troops here stayed on normal status even during their allies' 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea, which has been distributing waves of propaganda but only droplets 
of information since "the Great Leader" died last Friday, disclosed Thursday 
that Kim Il Chol, commander of the 46,000-member navy, had pledged his loyalty 
to Kim Jong Il. He was the first senior commander in the 1.1-million-member 
armed forces to offer such a pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "news" that the sacred 8,990-foot Mt. Paekdu, reputed in Korean 
mythology to be the birthplace of Dankun, the nation's creator, had joined the 
mourning for Kim Il Sung was reported elaborately. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea said the mountain was struck by violent storms that started just 
as "the great heart of the supreme brain of the Korean revolution stopped 
beating. . . . At a time when the whole country is overcome by deep sorrow . . 
. the ancestral mountain is writhing in grief," the North Korean Central News 
agency reported.

RELIGIOUS LEADERS ASSAIL TACTICS OF RIGHT-WING FUNDAMENTALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new coalition of religious leaders announced plans Thursday to counteract 
the political clout of the Christian Coalition and other conservative religious 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the Interfaith Alliance denounced the tactics of right-wing 
fundamentalist groups as well as recent broad-brush attacks on evangelical 
conservatives by Democrats, saying that both groups engage in "demonization" of 
advocates of different political positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which characterizes itself as nonpartisan and ecumenical, was 
formed just weeks after Clinton Administration officials and Democratic Party 
leaders condemned religious conservatives for engineering a "stealth takeover" 
of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new alliance's members are religious leaders from Catholic, 
Protestant, Jewish and other faiths. 
</P>
<P>
 On issues ranging from abortion to homosexual rights, the members may 
disagree, but each opposes invoking "God to assert the moral superiority of one 
people over another," said Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the 
National Council of Churches of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's leaders said evangelical right-wingers threaten American 
traditions of religious liberty by claiming to be the only representatives of 
true Christian values. 
</P>
<P>
 By using religion at once as a weapon and a shield, conservatives fragment the 
nation's families with "spiritual intimidation," said Dr. Herbert D. Valentine, 
a Presbyterian minister and the alliance's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religious extremism is being used as a weapon to attack politicians, to 
censor classroom textbooks, to cut back school breakfast programs, to promote 
discrimination and to mislead voters," Valentine said. "The message of the 
radical right is that there is only one way to think and live to be a good 
Christian." 
</P>
<P>
 The new group said it hopes to raise $4 million this year but will not endorse 
candidates or take positions on social issues. Instead, it plans to register 
voters, distribute voter guides describing how office-seekers stand on 
different issues and become a "national clearinghouse" for grass-roots 
organizations dedicated to religious freedom.

CONDEMNED MAN GETS 3RD TRIAL; OTHER ADMITTED RAPE, MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rolando Cruz was convicted twice and spent more than seven years on Death Row 
for a rape and murder another man admitted committing. His case became a cause; 
law school deans rallied to his side and a prosecutor resigned rather than 
"help execute an innocent man." 
</P>
<P>
 The tangled case took a new turn Thursday when the Illinois Supreme Court 
reversed a decision it made less than two years ago and granted Cruz a third 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz's wife, Nicole, hugged his attorney, Northwestern University law 
professor Lawrence Marshall, outside the Supreme Court offices after the 
decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rolando Cruz has lived in hell for many, many years and it is our intent to 
get him out of that," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, in a 4-3 ruling, decided that the judge in Cruz's most recent trial 
improperly excluded evidence about the criminal history of Brian Dugan, the man 
who admitted to the killing but who has never been charged. Dugan is serving 
life in prison for another murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz and another man, Alejandro Hernandez, were convicted in 1985 of the rape 
and murder of Jeanine Nicarico. The 10-year-old girl was home sick from school 
in the suburb of Naperville, west of Chicago, when she was abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz and Hernandez maintained their innocence, and the state Supreme Court 
overturned their convictions in 1988. They were convicted again at a second 
trial despite testimony about Dugan's admission.  
</P>
<P>
 Dugan refused to confess in court unless prosecutors agreed not to seek the 
death penalty. Prosecutors refused to accept his offer or believe his story, 
citing inconsistencies in his account and saying that details he provided of 
the crime could have been gleaned from news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, doubts about the case prompted the resignation of Mary Brigid Kenney, 
an assistant state attorney general assigned to fight Cruz's appeals. She said 
in her resignation: "I realized that I was being asked to help execute an 
innocent man." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that same year, the state Supreme Court voted, 4 to 3, to deny Cruz a 
new trial. But three new justices have joined the court, and last year it voted 
to reconsider. In Thursday's ruling, two of the new justices voted with the 
majority.

 The space shuttle Columbia's most prolific newt -- she had laid about 40 eggs 
in less than a week in orbit -- was found dead Thursday, an apparent victim of 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists lost not only the salamander but all of her eggs and 48 other newt 
eggs that were in the same laboratory tray and were contaminated by the dead 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a smiling day," said Japanese project scientist Shunji Nagaoka. 
"That's a big loss." 
</P>
<P>
 To add to the problem, one of the three surviving adult female newts has yet 
to lay an egg. Nagaoka said researchers fear that they may have selected a 
sterile newt. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia's two other newts had laid about a dozen eggs in space as of 
Thursday, six days into the scheduled 14-day mission devoted to research into 
how organisms reproduce, develop and adapt in space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese red-bellied newts were taken last winter from rice paddies in 
Japan. Female newts hibernate after the fall mating season and store sperm in 
their bodies for fertilizing their eggs in the spring. Scientists kept the 
newts refrigerated to prolong hibernation until a few days before Columbia's 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one bit of good newt news -- scientists announced Thursday that a 
second newt had been born in space. Both eggs had been laid on Earth before 
liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas researcher Michael Wiederhold said the dead newt probably succumbed to 
stress from hormone injections that were administered prior to flight to induce 
egg-laying, as well as the stress of laying so many eggs. The stress of 
spaceflight also may have been a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 There still are 90 viable, ground-laid newt eggs aboard Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that in the wild, only a very small number of newt eggs 
would survive," said Wiederhold, a researcher at the University of Texas Health 
Science Center in San Antonio. "Each newt lays 20 to 40, 50 eggs, so obviously 
if they'd all survive we'd have nothing but newts in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiederhold is studying the development of the gravity-sensing part of newts' 
inner ears. Scientists hope the research will help them understand space motion 
sickness in astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on board are goldfish, guppy-like Japanese Medaka fish and eggs, 
jellyfish, sea urchins and flies.

O.C. BRIDGE'S VERY EARLY DEMISE MAKES HISTORY; PROJECT: CALTRANS WISHES SOMEONE 
HAD COMPLAINED EARLIER ABOUT THE HALF-FINISHED SANTA ANA OVERPASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said Thursday that their plans to demolish a half-finished 
project that sparked furious community opposition marks a first in state 
history, and they wish someone had said something about it sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the Santa Ana School Board, the state Department of 
Transportation this week agreed to dismantle the half-finished pedestrian 
bridge over the Santa Ana Freeway. It will spend at least $60,000 to undo 
$600,000 worth of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Caltrans and school officials say things never should have got this far. 
But now the question is one of cost for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the children who would have used the bridge at 20th and Spurgeon 
streets to get to school on the northeast side of the freeway now will likely 
be bused, the school district may have to come up with an estimated $80,000 a 
year for busing. It also could face liability claims if children who walk a 
circuitous route to school along busy 17th Street are hit by cars, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has been paying to bus about 170 children to Hoover Elementary School 
from the lower-income, predominantly immigrant area west of the freeway while 
construction is underway. School board member Robert W. Balen said the district 
is hoping to persuade Caltrans to help with the busing until a new elementary 
school is built on the west side of the freeway, which may take up to three 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 But agency officials say that is unlikely now that the school district has 
indicated it doesn't need the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be phasing out the busing as quickly as possible," Barry Rabbit, 
Caltrans deputy district director for construction, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members concede the district will feel the pinch of Tuesday's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could be two classroom teachers. That could be field trips for the whole 
elementary division," board member Audrey Yamagata-Noji said earlier in the 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of residents on the well-manicured northeast side of the bridge 
aggressively opposed the project in recent months, fearing the bridge would be 
a conduit for criminals who live on the west side to cross over onto their 
placid streets. The $1.3-million bridge was supposed to replace a pedestrian 
tunnel that closed last year when the freeway was widened. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of west side parents whose children would have used the bridge 
answered a district poll recently and said they preferred busing. But critics 
of the movement to kill the project say east side residents' fears of crime are 
inflamed. The movement to seal off neighborhood borders in a bid for safety is 
shortsighted and doesn't address concerns of the community as a whole, they 
add. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Caltrans officials say the whole mess could have been averted had 
community members made the extent of their feelings known before construction 
began last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have worked in good faith for years, and never once was there a 
representation from the school board or the city that they didn't want this or 
that there was not a need," said Rabbit, who expects to get final written word 
from the city and school district by early next week asking Caltrans to call 
off the project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbit said a 1989 letter from the school district to the design contractor 
and a 1993 busing agreement with the district indicate that school officials 
were well aware of plans for the overcrossing. 
</P>
<P>
 And documents show that Caltrans and city officials met with the Northeast 
neighborhood group two years ago to discuss the overpass. According to minutes 
of the meeting, plans were moving ahead and state and city officials were 
talking to the school district about locking the gates at night in an effort to 
address neighborhood crime concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever said boo about not building it," Rabbit said. "It wasn't until 
the neighbors got excited a few months ago that the school board said they 
didn't need it." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials are just as bitter about the debacle, saying the hot 
potato never should have landed in their lap. Balen said the school district 
never received a copy of the environmental impact report, and even if it had, 
the document made no mention of the overcrossing, which replaced the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans never gave the district the option of calling the project off, said 
Gaylen Freeman, assistant superintendent for business services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just told it was happening. We weren't given an option at the time 
for input," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foot bridge is chalking up nicknames behind the school district's doors: 
There's "The Bridge on the River Kwai," for the 1957 Academy Award-winning film 
in which a bridge is painstakingly constructed only to be blown to bits at the 
end. And Yamagata-Noji has taken to calling it the "Simon and Garfunkel bridge" 
for a bridge "over troubled water" made famous by the duo's ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans is trying to look on the bright side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at it as a cost savings. Money is very tight right now, so if 
we can save (at least) $300,000, it'll go back into state funds, and the state 
can really use that money," said local Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a savings in that a decision was reached before additional work was 
done. Is the glass half empty or is the glass half full?" 
</P>
<P>
 Balen said that the school district isn't asking Caltrans to tear down the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wasteful, there's no doubt about that," Balen said. "But I think that's 
Caltrans' decision to tear it down or not. All we indicated in our vote was 
whether we needed the access or not. It's completely up to them.  
</P>
<P>
 A Caltrans spokesman in Sacramento says the planned demolition marks the first 
time community outrage has toppled a project that was structurally sound.  
</P>
<P>
 The community revolt is rivaled only by a legendary battle in the 1960s to 
halt construction of the Embarcadero Freeway in San Francisco, which was 
supposed to connect with the Golden Gate Bridge but was halted halfway, said 
Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago. 
</P>
<P>
 But even that project was simply stopped in midroute and not torn down, Drago 
said. The built portion remained in operation until the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake gave critics another shot at removing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first," Drago said. "Nothing comes to mind where we actually went 
in there and tore something down once construction was started unless it was 
for some engineering reasons."

TOLL PUT AT FOUR IN FISHING BOAT SINKING OFF O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD and TALLY GOLDSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 They work long hours for little pay on rickety boats that often lack basic 
safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 That portrait of a gill-net fisherman's risky existence emerged Thursday as 
authorities continued their investigation into the sinking of a fishing boat in 
a busy shipping lane 10 miles off the coast here. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials said Thursday that four men apparently were on board the 
45-foot fishing vessel Tammy, which was based in Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of two -- Nhieu Van Nguyen, 52, a licensed fisherman from El Monte, 
and Khanh Nguyen, 50, of Alhambra -- were recovered amid boat debris Tuesday 
morning. The discovery set off a daylong air and sea search by the Coast Guard, 
but the vessel and the other two bodies have not been found. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat's owner, Cong Minh Ta, 54, of San Gabriel, is missing and presumed 
dead, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities identified the fourth man as Gioi Nguyen, 59, of San Pedro, a 
sometime fishing partner of the other victims, whose son reported him missing. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims were related, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four vessels had passed through the shipping corridor overnight Monday and 
will be examined for signs of a collision when they reach port, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities sought to determine what happened to the Tammy, relatives and 
seamen described the risky existence of gill-net fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always writing about cops getting killed, but this happens to us 
all the time," said Andy Stanojevich, a San Pedro fisherman who sails from the 
same port where the Tammy used to dock. "It's a much higher risk occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 A state ban on gill-net fishing, which went into effect on Jan. 1 but has been 
tied up by lawsuits, has forced the fishermen -- who anchor long nets in the 
sea floor to snare fish and sea cucumbers -- into deeper waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the estimated 300 fishing boats docked in Los Angeles Harbor are said 
to be poorly maintained and to lack good lighting and navigational equipment 
for work that often goes on at night so that the fishermen can reach the market 
by morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard inspector F.L. McClain said federal regulations require safety 
gear, such as life jackets and emergency beacons, but boat inspections are not 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the average they're in really bad shape," said Coast Guard Petty Officer 
Randy Reid. "Just being on board for a short time, I'm always worried for my 
safety -- wondering whether it's going to sink." 
</P>
<P>
 Close calls with the mammoth freighters and tankers that travel the same 
waters are part of everyday life, prompting suspicions among fishermen that the 
Tammy sank after a collision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a ritual for (the ships) to come as close as they can," said fisherman 
Bob Aguilar. "It's like they do it on purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Nhieu Van Nguyen, whose body was recovered Tuesday, knew those perils better 
than anyone, his family said in interviews Thursday. He escaped with a broken 
rib when a boat he owned sank three years ago after being struck by a steamer, 
according to friends and relatives. Nguyen was listed as a skipper for two 
other fishing boats. Both of them sank this year, but he was not aboard either 
one, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nhieu was fishing for his whole life," said younger brother Kieu Nguyen, 34, 
of San Gabriel. The brothers moved from Vietnam 12 years ago. "When we came 
here, I told him I could get him another job, doing gardening or cleaning. But 
he said, 'No. Only fishing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ta, the owner of the Tammy, bought the 30-year-old, steel-hulled vessel last 
fall and poured $30,000 into making it suitable for gill-net fishing, friends 
said. Nhieu Nguyen was always at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 During the repair, a Coast Guard inspector cited Ta once for leaking diesel 
fuel into the harbor, and an inspector who went aboard the docked boat urged 
him to stop welding because the boat lacked working fire extinguishers, 
authorities said. Work on the boat was finished last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "They worked on the boat for about six months," said Liem Nguyen, 21, Nhieu's 
only daughter. "He thought it was just like new." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with Vietnamese tradition, Kieu Nguyen will hang a picture of his 
older brother beside incense, fruit and a statue of Buddha in his San Gabriel 
home after Saturday's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Kieu Nguyen said he had not seen his brother in about three weeks and learned 
of his death through television reports. Nhieu Van Nguyen lived most recently 
in El Monte, but he often stayed with friends elsewhere in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I didn't know where he was staying," Kieu Nguyen said. "But if I 
wanted to see him, I'd just go to the docks."

O.C. HOSPITAL AMONG 23 IN STATE WITH ELITE RANK; HEALTH CARE: KAISER ANAHEIM 
FACILITY AMONG THOSE RATED BY AN AGENCY OF EXPERTS AS NATION'S TOP 5%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Twenty-three California hospitals are ranked among the top 5% of all U.S. 
hospitals in overall administrative quality, the national agency that sets 
standards for health care institutions reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A special commendation was given to just 273 of the 5,300 institutions 
surveyed by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, 
which has been reviewing hospitals for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission reviews hospitals every three years and the list issued 
Thursday is the first formal roster of a new ranking called "accreditation with 
commendation." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the California hospitals with the highest ranking are nine Kaiser 
facilities, in Anaheim, Bellflower, Panorama City, San Diego, San Francisco, 
Santa Rosa, Vallejo, Walnut Creek and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinary accreditation "means they are trying to operate the hospital in a way 
that I can feel reasonably safe going there and increases the likelihood that I 
will be treated well there," said Dr. Paul Schyve, the commission's senior vice 
president. The special commendation ranking means that the "hospital has been 
particularly dedicated in trying to do all things well, not just to meet the 
standards at an average level." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kenneth E. Bell, chief of staff at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in 
Anaheim, the only Orange County hospital to make the joint commission's top 
achievement list, called his hospital "the best-kept secret in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said the 200-bed hospital is relatively unknown, although it is the only 
acute care hospital serving the county's 190,000 Kaiser Permanente members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until now, we haven't had much of a marketing presence," Bell said. "But we 
will in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim hospital achieved the commendation because of its overall quality, 
but it has particular strengths in obstetrics, anesthesia, internal medicine 
and surgery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a teaching hospital affiliated with UCI (College of Medicine) and have 
our own residency in family medicine," Bell noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission survey includes more than 2,000 separate standards, including 
such issues as infection control, record-keeping for patients, use of 
pharmaceuticals, training of physicians, and the safety and security of 
buildings. A directive to improve performance in any of the areas means that 
the hospital has a "Type 1" defect and cannot receive the commendation ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranking, in effect, gives a gold star to a hospital's overall performance 
but is not intended as a guide to patients for specific treatments or 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Most surveys of hospital quality measure the outcomes of specific medical 
procedures, such as the percentage of patients who survive heart transplants, 
bypass operations and the like. The Joint Commission survey, in contrast, 
focuses primarily on administrative procedures and specifically excludes such 
medical outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A small local hospital may be excellent but often it does not have specialty 
services," said Schyve. "Clearly, if I have to have a heart transplant I will 
go to the university hospital because a small hospital will not have that kind 
of service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some prestigious university hospital centers are located in old buildings 
needing safety improvements, a problem that could produce a Type 1 defect 
blocking the top rating, Schyve said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of all U.S. hospitals are accredited. The special commendation 
category was created in 1991 and some hospitals that have received the accolade 
have publicized their own awards since then. But the commission waited until a 
full three-year cycle had been completed and all hospitals reviewed to issue 
its first complete roster of the highest-ranked institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really pleased for the 23 California hospitals that did receive the 
commendation," said Dorel Harms, vice president for professional services at 
the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're concerned that no one jump to any conclusions because this is such 
a dynamic process," she said. "The process of review at hospitals has changed 
tremendously in recent years. . . . Over the next three years, we expect that 
probably more hospitals will receive the commendation ranking." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the response was more skeptical. "Inevitably report 
cards are going to become a fact of life for hospitals," said David Langness, 
vice president of communications for the Hospital Council of Southern 
California in Los Angeles. "But we still haven't found one that is completely 
objective and, frankly, I don't know if we ever will." 
</P>
<P>
 California hospitals with the commendation ranking, in addition to the Kaiser 
institutions, are: Enloe Hospital in Chico, Atascadero State Hospital, Scripps 
Memorial in Chula Vista, Sutter Davis Memorial in Davis, Vencor 
Hospital-Sacramento in Folsom, CPC Rancho Lindo in Fontana, Cedar Vista in 
Fresno; Green Hospital of Scripps in La Jolla, Community Hospital of Monterey 
Peninsula, Naval Medical Center in Oakland, Sutter Memorial in Sacramento, 
David Grant USAF Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base, West Hills Medical 
Center and Whittier Hospital Medical Center.

EX-EL TORO MAN HELD AFTER BODY IS FOUND IN FREEZER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former El Toro resident was arrested after a tip from Phoenix police led to 
the discovery of a body in a freezer in the back of a rental truck, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavapai County sheriff's deputies went to the Prescott Country Club home of 
John Famalaro on Wednesday after getting the tip that the truck was stolen and 
might be parked there, said sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie Berra. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies found an extension cord running from the freezer in the truck in the 
driveway to his house, Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, who was found later, rented the truck in January in El Toro, his 
home before moving to the Prescott area, Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, was being held in the Yavapai County Jail on suspicion of theft 
and first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck and the freezer have been taken to the Department of Public Safety's 
crime lab in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 The body had not been identified or a cause of death determined, Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix police had told Yavapai County authorities the truck may be involved 
in drug trafficking, but the freezer, sealed with tape, caught the attention of 
deputies, Berra said.

FAMILY FILES SUIT IN DEATH OF TEEN AT CONSTRUCTION SITE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a 19-year-old Mission Viejo man who died when he fell into a 
hole at a Foothill toll road construction site filed a wrongful death lawsuit 
Thursday against transportation and construction officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by the mother and sister of Michael Suss, claims the 
construction site was negligently designed and maintained.It names the state, 
the county, the Transportation Corridor Agencies and MCM Construction Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Lowsen, an Anaheim attorney representing Linda and Jennifer Suss, said 
Michael Suss was riding his dirt bike with two other friends on the afternoon 
of Nov. 23 when he fell into an unmarked hole more than 3 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just disappeared and (his friends) went looking for him and found his 
body," Lowsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager, who was training at the time to take over his family's 
electrical business, died of multiple injuries, Lowsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fence at the Foothill Transportation Corridor site was open at the time of 
the incident, Lowsen said. The suit seeks unspecified damages.

2 ALASKA INDIAN YOUTHS EXILED TO ISLANDS FOR CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crime: Another violent, small-change urban robbery. The criminals: Two 
rural teen-age Alaska Indians. The punishment: Banishment for one year on 
uninhabited islands with only hand tools and a little food. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the victim: A new house. 
</P>
<P>
 This experiment in cross-cultural jurisprudence was set in motion in a 
Washington state courtroom this week when a judge agreed to give old-fashioned 
tribal justice a chance to make right for all those involved. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Washington law, Alaskans Adrian J. Guthrie and Simon P. Roberts, 
both 17 and Tlingit natives of southeast Alaska, faced from three to 5 1/2 
years in prison after pleading guilty to the robbery of a pizza delivery man in 
Everett last summer. The victim was severely beaten with a baseball bat and 
remains partially deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 In such violent crimes, Washington law specifically calls for punishment, not 
rehabilitation. And the chance of restitution in such cases is remote. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, Superior Court Judge James Allendoerfer listened 
sympathetically and gave the go-ahead to a different approach, the Tlingit way. 
He agreed to release the two teen-agers to custody of a tribal court for 
imposition of the sentence of one year's banishment plus restitution to the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Columbus came, one thing he didn't find here was prisons," Tlingit Judge 
Rudy James explained to attorneys on both sides of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In 18 months, the confessed robbers will again be brought before Allendoerfer 
to decide whether their case should be closed or additional punishment is 
deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors objected to the experiment, arguing that it would open the door to 
all sorts of cultural exceptions and challenges to state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tlingit approach, as explained in court here, calls for rehabilitation of 
the criminal and assistance for the victim. "A balancing of the books," public 
defender Al Kitching explained. "Without that, these young men will never be 
accepted back in the tribe." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the Tlingit pledged to build the victim a new duplex or triplex 
and pay for his sizable medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the two robbers, a tribal court official and defense attorneys said 
they would be banished to separate uninhabited islands on native lands in the 
Gulf of Alaska for 12 months. They will be given some basic hand tools and 
enough food for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman said the punishment was in keeping with the traditions of the 
Tlingit, a coastal native people with a current population of about 2,000 and 
declining. The word Tlingit is spelled a variety of ways and has a subtle 
native pronunciation outside the range of English. Non-natives most typically 
say "clink-it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although this case focused on Native American law and culture, banishment "has 
ancient precursors" in other cultures as well, said Sam Pillsbury, professor of 
legal history at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Among others, ancient Greeks 
employed banishment for severe crimes, and England previously banished 
criminals to the United States and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said the primary test for a sentence of banishment is whether it 
could be considered cruel or unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it particularly cruel or degrading?" Pillsbury asked. "I wouldn't think 
so, particularly when you consider the typical alternatives for armed robbery" 
-- that is, incarcerating teen-agers in high-security prisons for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, Tlingit leaders said they would monitor the banished youths from 
time to time but offer them no assistance. Authorities did not specify the 
location of the banishment islands, but the region is rich with fish and 
coastal shellfish, traditional foods of the Tlingit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A yearlong banishment, under the community supervision . . . would require 
these young men to improve themselves and to ruminate upon their crime. In 
addition, (the sentence) would make frugal use of the state's resources," 
defense attorneys argued. 
</P>
<P>
 After their exile on the islands, the two are to continue their rehabilitation 
by working at a native sawmill. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred in August. Prosecuting attorney Michael Magee said the 
two teen-agers, then 16, called and ordered a pizza and asked that the driver 
bring change for a $50 bill. They gave an address and then waited nearby. When 
Tim Whittlesey arrived with the food, he was attacked from behind and beaten. 
The robbers got away with less than $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittlesey appeared in court this week and told the judge that he lost hearing 
in one ear and partially in the other, and had to endure a long and painful 
rehabilitation. His injuries cost him his dream of going to medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried that the kids would take off and never (be) seen again," said 
Whittlesey, who still walks with a limp. 
</P>
<P>
 The two native youths were charged as adults in Washington because of the 
violent nature of their attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the two had spent most of their lives in rural southeast 
Alaska in the village of Klawock, on Prince of Wales Island, east of the town 
of Ketchikan. At the time of the crime, they were visiting family in Everett, 
30 miles north of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been in custody here for 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Magee argued against the banishment sentence, although he conceded 
mixed feelings in the end. On one hand, he said, the promises of restitution 
and rehabilitation were more than the Washington judicial system could offer or 
hope for. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand," Magee said, "I have a good deal of difficulty in 
accepting the idea that we treat people differently under the law because they 
come from different cultural backgrounds. I can see now I'll be facing all 
kinds of motions and arguments based on someone's cultural background."

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; HOW CAN WE SPEED RECOVERY 
FROM QUAKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday marks the six-month anniversary of the disastrous magnitude 6.8 
Northridge earthquake. Damaged freeways are operable, but still being repaired. 
Most homes and businesses either destroyed or damaged in the Jan. 17 quake are 
in various stages of reconstruction. But telltale rubble lies here and there in 
the streets, still waiting to be picked up. Many damaged apartments and 
condominium complexes -- some in ruins -- stand vacant. And this week, owners 
of the Laurel Plaza mall in North Hollywood said some of its stores may not 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the City Council asked the Community Redevelopment Agency to 
establish emergency redevelopment areas so that property taxes can be used for 
earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 What should the government do to continue helping the victims of the Jan. 17 
quake? 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavksy, Los Angeles city councilman: 
</P>
<P>
 "The SBA has to become more responsive to the realities of the San Fernando 
Valley quake. While FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) has been 
terrific, the SBA (Small Business Administration) has been virtually as 
rigorous as conventional services. The SBA has to be more forthcoming with 
resources to help businesses and apartment buildings, not to mention 
single-family homes. I think the rules have to be changed and the criteria for 
loans have to be liberalized so that the SBA can become a positive factor in 
the recovery of the San Fernando Valley and other damaged areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council this week approved the development of a redevelopment plan. 
We are looking at a project in Sherman Oaks that has been reasonably 
well-received by the public . . . SBA has to become a constructive agent of 
recovery instead of a source of bureaucratic frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Liliana Perez, field coordinator for Project Rebound, a FEMA-sponsored agency 
providing crisis counseling for the mentally ill and other recovery services: 
</P>
<P>
 "What the government needs to do is continue with the public relations and 
with grants to nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles County and, in my 
opinion, especially in the San Fernando Valley. This information should not 
just be in English . . . and needs to be disseminated to the school and local 
organizations . . . They should create more job opportunities for the youth and 
create more educational classes for adults on disaster preparedness . . . (The 
government should also make sure that people seeking aid) will not be 
intimidated because they might not have complete, proper documentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Spooner, president of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce: 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, FEMA and the SBA did a magnificent job in getting the 
information out. They probably could have done a little bit better job at 
coordinating. We are still getting calls from people . . . who haven't heard 
back or don't know where they are in the loop. What I would love to see is for 
the SBA or FEMA to come out with a statement about where we are and how long do 
we expect to go until things are satisfied . . . A quarterly update at least 
through the end of the year . . . should be sent to the chambers or the 
communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Littman of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency: 
</P>
<P>
 "The CRA is working closely with the nine districts including the Valley to 
put emergency projects together. We're not there for the quick fix. We pick up 
where the state and federal government leave off. . . . By October or November, 
the City Council could adopt a redevelopment plan to rebuild abandoned housing 
tracts and work with commercial strips like Ventura Boulevard. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not the Lone Ranger. But clearly, with the recent failure of the state 
bond measure, federal money is limited. Local government has to do more and 
we're prepared to help with that. . . . Redevelopment can't be done overnight. 
It's a vehicle for focusing public and private resources to the community. . . 
. The main thing is we are a tool if the community wants us."

POLITICAL BRIEFING: ALARCON IN UPHILL FIGHT TO GET LOPEZ CANYON LANDFILL CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN and JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TRASH TALKING: The politics of trash have never been neat or pretty. But 
freshman Councilman Richard Alarcon is, nonetheless, jumping into the thick of 
it with both feet by leading a campaign to have the Lopez Canyon Landfill 
closed when its operating permit expires in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The city-owned landfill sits on the northeast edge of his district and takes 
in 80% of the city's refuse. It has been a longtime source of aggravation for 
his constituents, who complain about truck traffic, odors, noise and trash. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's Sanitation Department has recommended extending the life of the 
landfill until 2000, on the premise that the city will save on the cost of 
hauling the trash elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon's effort will probably be the toughest fight of his brief tenure, 
partly because he will have to convince council colleagues who don't have 
landfills in their districts to sympathize with his plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The uphill battle he is going to face is with certain districts in the 
Downtown areas that don't know the problems we have with landfills," said Greig 
Smith, chief of staff for Councilman Hal Bernson, who fought for years to close 
the Sunshine Canyon Landfill in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes time to decide whether to support Alarcon, many council members 
will probably ask why the city should put up the money and energy to establish 
a new waste disposal program when Lopez Canyon has the capacity to take trash 
for another four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon has already begun his sales pitch. Last month he took Councilwoman 
Laura Chick on a helicopter tour of the nine landfills in and around his 
district. Chick's support is going to be crucial because she heads the 
council's committee on environmental quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chick says she understands Alarcon's plight, she says she is going to 
have to be sold on a viable alternative before she supports the closure of 
Lopez Canyon in 1996. That means Alarcon is going to have to package his sales 
job with a quick and relatively inexpensive alternative -- if such a thing 
exists. 
</P>

 HOME SWEET HOME: With the recent purchase of a home in North Hollywood, U.S. 
Rep. Howard Berman has re-established himself as a bona fide resident of his 
own 26th District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Berman residency issue arose in 1992 after reapportionment shifted the 
26th District eastward, leaving the congressman residing in a rental home in 
Sherman Oaks that was suddenly outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman denied the relocation was designed to forestall election season 
criticism that he has lived for nearly two years outside his East San Fernando 
Valley-based congressional district. "That's not really it," Berman said this 
week. In fact, it was not until recently -- when the Sherman Oaks lease expired 
and the finances were available -- that it was possible to make a move back 
into the district, Berman said. He noted as well that the law only requires 
congressmen to live in the state they represent, not the district. 
</P>
<P>
 As questions about Berman's residency bobbed to the surface in what has 
otherwise been a virtually invisible election contest, Berman's staff members 
noted that their boss invariably flies into Los Angeles from the nation's 
capital to spend his weekends meeting with constituents and seeing his wife, 
Janice, and their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such claims, GOP challenger Gary Forsch, who will face Berman in the 
November election, remained a disbeliever. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsch, who works in his family owned hardware store, said it was evident to 
him that Berman moved to North Hollywood to nip any criticism in the bud. "I 
made an issue of it in 1992 and I was fixing to do it again," said Forsch, who 
unsuccessfully ran against Berman two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope Berman can deal with issues in Washington faster than it's taken him 
to move back into his district," Forsch quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there has been another change in Berman's living arrangements. 
Recently the congressman began sharing an apartment in Washington with U.S. 
Rep. Alan Wheat (D-Missouri). Previously, Berman had spent his weekdays in 
Washington living out of hotel rooms. "It beats having to schlep your stuff 
around every weekend," said Berman aide Gene Smith of the new arrangement. "Now 
he can at least keep a suit here." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 WHAT UNITY?: Post-primary Republican Party unity is still proving elusive in 
the 24th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be recalled that attorney Richard Sybert, a recent arrival to the San 
Fernando Valley, got 47% of the vote in June to win the nod from the GOP to run 
against U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than a month has elapsed since the primary, several of Sybert's 
GOP peers have still not agreed to support their party's standard-bearer as he 
prepares to go head-to-head against Beilenson. So much for that hackneyed photo 
op of former political foes clasping hands to win one for the Gipper. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking consultant Bob Hammer reaffirmed this week that he will not back 
Sybert, and realtor Emery Shane seconded that emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say there is a certain je ne sais quoi about Sybert and the 
vindictiveness with which he ran his campaign that makes it virtually 
impossible (to support him now)," Shane said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong -- I'm not supporting Beilenson either," Shane said. "The 
big dilemma for me is this: I feel Beilenson is honestly wrong in his politics 
but Sybert is a guy I can't trust even though I agree with him on a number of 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Shane received 8% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer, who came in second with 17% of the vote, agreed that it was unlikely 
that he would back Sybert. "I acknowledge that they ran a clever campaign, but 
it was not one designed to unite the party afterward," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a contrary stance was public relations man Mark Boos Benhard, an aide 
to former Rep. William Dannemeyer, who scored 12% of the vote in the June 7 
primary. Benhard, who allied himself with right-wing Republicans during the 
race, said he would encourage all Republicans to back the party's nominees in 
November. "And that includes Sybert," Benhard said this week. On the other 
hand, Benhard acknowledged, no one from Sybert's camp has approached him to 
help out. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 NAME GAMES: When you are a council member in the second largest city in 
America, it can be difficult to keep straight the names of all those 
bureaucrats, constituents and community leaders that you deal with on a daily 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude learned that a mix-up can be 
embarrassing. That lesson came at a recent council meeting when the discussion 
was on a plan by a coalition of churches and synagogues to use city funding for 
an anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the organization, known as Hope in Youth, was at the podium 
answering questions about the program when Braude arose to make his own 
queries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. McAllister," he said, trying to get the man's attention. "Mr. 
McAllister," Braude said louder, still unable to get the man's attention. "Mr. 
McAllister, would you please look at me when I'm speaking to you," he said, 
almost shouting.  
</P>
<P>
 "My name is Mr. Fitzgerald," answered Greg Fitzgerald, the director of Hope in 
Youth, as some observers in the council chamber bit their tongues to keep from 
laughing.

OBITUARIES; JACK FIVES; AEROSPACE ENGINEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Fives, an aerospace engineer who after an early retirement returned to 
college and found a second career as a volunteer fingerprint examiner for the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, has died. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
 A Canyon Country resident since 1969, Fives died Tuesday at Wadsworth Veterans 
Administration Hospital in Los Angeles. According to his son, J. Timothy Fives, 
he had been in a coma since a February heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 20 years as an aerospace engineer at Lockheed's Burbank 
facility, he was forced by a heart attack into early retirement in 1981. He 
returned to school, first to College of the Canyons and then UCLA. In 1988, he 
graduated from UCLA with a bachelor's degree in Asian studies -- the oldest 
graduate in his class at age 62. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, he began working as a volunteer with the Santa Clarita Valley 
Sheriff's Station, performing latent print analyses. Equipped with his own 
mobile crime lab, Fives assisted sheriff's deputies with a variety of criminal 
investigations. He also gave testimony in many preliminary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., he joined the Navy during World War II. While 
stationed in Japan from 1949-1952, Fives worked as an investigator for the 
Navy's Criminal Investigation Division, where he received training in latent 
print analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he met his wife, Carol, while both were employed as radio 
operators for United Airlines. They were married in 1948. The Fiveses came to 
the San Fernando Valley in 1958, settling in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined Lockheed the next year and worked on a variety of classified 
projects during his 22 years with the defense contractor. In 1969, he and his 
wife moved to Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son and wife, Fives is survived by a daughter, Michele 
Fives of Canyon Country; a brother, Donald Fives of Coral Gables, Fla.; and two 
sisters, Paula Fives of Burlington, Vt., and Fritzi Garber of Wayne, N.J., and 
one grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held 11 a.m. Tuesday at St. Clare Catholic Church, 
19606 Calla Way, Canyon Country. In accordance with Fives' wishes, his ashes 
will be scattered at sea. The Neptune Society in Burbank is handling 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Citizens Protection Alliance, 
2210 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 174, Santa Monica 90403.

TURNER'S TURN AT TURNBERRY; BRITISH OPEN: LITTLE-KNOWN NEW ZEALANDER HOLES OUT 
A TWO-IRON FOR HIS SECOND EAGLE AND LEADS WITH A 65. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Welcome to the 123rd British Open, where your first-round leader is Greg 
Turner, a New Zealand no-name who misses the cut at the Masters -- the 
Turespana Masters -- but holes a two-iron for an eagle Thursday at Turnberry's 
Ailsa Course . . . in the rain . . . in the wind . . . on statistically the 
toughest course in the tournament rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 His five-under-par 65 put him one stroke ahead of Jonathan Lomas, the 
26-year-old son of an English chicken farmer. This is the same Lomas who 
counted his pence so closely that he slept in his car during trips to 
tournaments in France. 
</P>
<P>
 And just behind Lomas is American Andrew Magee, who was born in Paris, moved 
to Tripoli, then London and then, of course, to Farmer's Branch, Tex. After 
checking in with a three-under 67, the goateed-Magee declined to detail the 
recent changes in his swing mechanics, but he did discuss his intentions to buy 
a bagpipe and his fondness for whistling. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't exactly the leader board that tournament officials had in mind, but 
then again, it's early. Everyone knows that, especially Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The British Open is littered with people, unknowns who disappear," said 
Turner, who has missed the cut here three of five times. "If we're still having 
this chat on Saturday night, it might be different." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't count on it, not with the cast of thousands lurking below. Eleven 
players, among them John Daly and five-time British Open champion Tom Watson, 
shot two-under-par 68s. Sixteen players, most notably U.S. Open champion Ernie 
Els and Nick Price, winner of the 1992 PGA Championship, sit comfortably at one 
under. And if Turner keeps looking over his shoulder he'll see 36 others within 
six strokes of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The one to watch is defending champion Greg Norman, who squeezed out a 
one-over 71 on a day when his swing was so-so and the weather was oh-no -- 
blustery in the morning, downpour stricken in the afternoon. Still, Norman 
slogged through it, announcing afterward that he thought little of all those 
red numbers on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys are two under," he said. "That means nothing, absolutely 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise there. Norman remembers his victory here in 1986. His first-round 
score: 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was so quick to dismiss the day's round, however. Watson loved 
his 68. He'd take it Thursday, today, Saturday and Sunday, if it could be 
arranged. That's eight under, good enough by Watson's calculations to win the 
tournament and tie Harry Vardon for most British Open titles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there was one disclaimer. "I think seven to 12 under par will win," 
he said. "Unless we get a real calm day." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Watson's interview was interrupted by a steady thumping on the 
interview tent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rain?" said Watson. "Oh, that's too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson teed off at 7:35 a.m., which isn't exactly the nicest way to treat a 
five-time champion. Bleary-eyed from a semi-sleepless night, Watson failed to 
take advantage of the downwind front nine but recovered nicely on the much more 
difficult back nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had cobwebs in my head all morning," said Watson, who was finally lulled to 
sleep by the World Cup late-show, Italy vs. Bulgaria. "Still do." 
</P>
<P>
 Today should be better. He tees off at a more reasonable 12:05, when the sun 
is supposed to make an appearance. Unfortunately, so is the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the day's events were shaped by the arrival of an afternoon storm. 
Norman saw it come in from the Firth of Clyde and made a beeline for his rain 
gear. He wasn't crazy about his 71, but it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he could have been Ian Woosnam, the former Masters champion who 
shot a 79. Or Phil Mickelson, who had a 78. Or Nick Faldo, the three-time 
British Open champion who shot a 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Faldo earned knucklehead honors by hitting the wrong ball on his second shot 
at No. 17, a 498-yard par-five that had been giving up birdies all day. Instead 
of leaving the hole at two over for the round -- one over if he makes a birdie 
-- Faldo stalked off with the dreaded Frosty the Snowman: an eight. Two-stroke 
penalties can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," said Faldo. "It was not very clever." 
</P>
<P>
 As Faldo staggered to his 75, Turner was playing . . . well, the way Faldo 
used to. Turner birdied the par-three sixth, eagled the par-five seventh and 
then, as the weather worsened and the BBC cameras began moving his way, he 
recorded two more birdies and one more eagle in the last five holes. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the second eagle on No. 16, a 410-yard par four. Left with 178 yards 
after his drive, Turner took a two-iron and then asked his caddie, "This isn't 
too much club, is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The caddie checked the wind again and said, "No, it's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 A swing and one bounce later, Turner's ball dipped into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds easy, doesn't it," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds easy now. But it's early.

ANGELS MOURN BIG LOSS; BASEBALL: LANGSTON, IN PARTICULAR, FEELS LOSS OF REESE, 
AND HE ALSO LOSES TO THE ORIOLES, 3-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel starter Mark Langston, who hates to talk, much less acknowledge anyone 
on the days he pitches, abruptly stopped his warm-up pitches in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked toward the outfield fence Thursday night and intently watched the 
video board, unwilling to miss a moment of the tribute to his dear friend, 
Jimmie Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no one closer to Reese than Langston on the current roster. They 
were nearly inseparable in spring training, and every time Langston won the 
Gold Glove, he made sure that everyone knew that Reese was responsible for the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what made it so painful for Langston on Thursday night, with the game 
he wanted so badly to win, ending in a 3-2 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, in 
front of 18,821 fans at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still hard to believe he's not here," Langston said. "He was such an 
important part of everything we do in this organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how much we're going to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston had pitched brilliantly the entire game, extending his scoreless 
streak against the Orioles to 25 innings -- and not allowing a single 
baserunner to reach third -- until everything unraveled at once in the eighth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Sabo ended Langston's shutout by leading off the eighth with a homer 
into the left-field seats. Rafael Palmeiro ended Langston's chances of victory 
by following with a mammoth homer into the right-field seats, measured at 435 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston retired Cal Ripken and Chris Hoiles, but then walked Leo Gomez, who 
went to second on a wild pitch. Chris Hammonds then followed with a single to 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Jim Edmonds picked the ball up cleanly, and made a perfect throw 
to the plate. Home-plate umpire Larry McCoy was starting to signal Gomez out at 
the plate when Gomez kicked the ball out of catcher Greg Myers' glove for a 3-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Mark Leiter entered the game and prevented any further damage, 
but it was too late, the Angels (38-52) were on their way to another loss, once 
again giving them the American League's worst record. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Oriole starter Ben McDonald (11-6) won for the first time since 
June 17, yielding five hits through eight innings, surviving a scare in the 
eighth when left fielder Jack Voigt caught Chili Davis' potential two-run homer 
atop the left-field fence. McDonald stepped aside for Lee Smith in the ninth 
inning, who saved his 30th game of the season despite allowing a run on a 
single by Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Reese could rescue the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, their beloved 92-year-old coach who died Wednesday morning, was on all 
of the players' minds when they convened for their first game since the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 They saw Reese's jersey folded neatly in a picture frame sitting inside his 
locker, and they quietly put on their warm-up jerseys with black patches 
embroidered with No. 50, honoring Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 They smiled after batting practice when they asked where their games uniforms 
were, and informed that they wouldn't be available until Saturday. They would 
be wearing their blue warm-ups, in honor of Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had been informed that they need approval by major league baseball 
to wear a patch above their heart on their game uniform honoring Reese. So they 
improvised. Wearing their warm-up jerseys with a patch on their left sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also wear the practice jersey tonight, hoping that by Saturday major 
league baseball will inform them where they can apply their honorary patch, 
considering their two uniform sleeves already are taken. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who had a moment of silence before the game, also passed out 
Jimmie Reese memorial buttons to their ushers and front-office executives.

MORNING BRIEFING: HERE'S A CHANCE TO GIVE MARTINA FITTING SENDOFF

 Want to say a personal goodby to Martina Navratilova? Here's your chance. 
Write her a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, 37, the nine-time Wimbledon champion who is retiring from singles 
competition at the end of the year, will be presented a scrapbook of letters 
from well-wishers when she plays her final local tournament in the Virginia 
Slims of Los Angeles, Aug. 8-14, at Manhattan Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 As a farewell gift, Navratilova fans can send their letters and contributions 
to the Red Cross in her name for earthquake relief: Martina Navratilova 
Farewell, P.O. Box 570506, Tarzana, 91357.

 Trivia time: How many times did Joe DiMaggio keep his 56-game hitting streak 
alive with a hit in his last time at bat? 
</P>
<P>
 Silence award: It goes to the most puzzling reaction of the week, the one from 
USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett, who refused to comment when George Raveling 
decided to stay at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me, but how can the athletic director say nothing when his basketball 
coach almost takes a job at another major college program, then stays on? 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers game: New Giant Darryl Strawberry's uniform No. 17 has previously been 
worn in San Francisco by such players as Ozzie Virgil, Cap Peterson, Randy 
Moffitt, Charlie Hayes, Kirt Manwaring, Dave Martinez, Angel Escobar, Kevin 
Bass and Luis Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 History: On this date in 1967, Eddie Mathews of the Astros hit his 500th home 
run, against San Francisco's Juan Marichal at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 And just to show that history repeats itself, on this date in 1968, Hank Aaron 
of the Atlanta Braves hit his 500th home run, against the Giants' Mike 
McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
 Old news: AEI Speakers Bureau promotes and represents a bunch of sports 
figures, but it must be working from an old roster. On a recent list, they sort 
of blew their clients' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the list, for instance, Whitey Herzog is manager of the Angels, which he 
did 20 years ago for four games as a fill-in; Lou Piniella is manager of the 
Cincinnati Reds, whom he left after the 1992 season, and Jerry Tarkanian is 
coach of the San Antonio Spurs, who fired him 20 games into the 1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more. Kansas City running back Marcus Allen is an "LA Raider great," 
and Greg Bell is an "LA Rams running back," even though he left the Rams five 
years ago and has not played for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Seven times. 
</P>

GOLF ROUNDUP; LITTLE, HOPING TO MAKE THIS CUT, SHOOTS A 67 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sally Little, a 15-time champion on the LPGA tour but winless since 1988, and 
Nancy Ramsbottom, looking for her first title, each shot a four-under-par 67 
Thursday and shared the first-round lead in the $650,000 JAL Big Apple Classic 
at New Rochelle, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 JoAnne Carner, one of the 13 members of the LPGA Hall of Fame, shared third 
place with Trish Johnson of England, who spent the last four weeks competing in 
Europe. They each shot a 68 on the 6,095-yard Wykagyl Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
 Little, a 44-year-old native of South Africa who became an American citizen in 
1982, has missed seven cuts in 14 tournaments this year. 
</P>
<P>
 She had four birdies on the front nine and went 15 holes before making 
consecutive bogeys. She closed with two more birdies, a 15-foot putt, her 
longest of the round, and a two-footer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased with what I shot today," said Little, who has been on the 
tour for 23 years. "Wykagyl is a U.S. Open-caliber course and plays four shots 
harder than any other course on our tour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Brisky, a PGA Tour rookie, made a 30-foot birdie putt on his first hole 
and went on to shoot a six-under-par 66, joining Mike Sullivan and Brandel 
Chamblee atop the leader board of the Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic at Madison, 
Miss.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; IT TAKES TIME, BUT WHITE SOX CATCH THE INDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a month-long chase of the Cleveland Indians, the Chicago White Sox are 
back on top in the Central Division. And in this season of uncertainty, they 
know how important that can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be kidding yourself to say this is not a big series. It's big when you 
are going to play another team eight times in 11 games for first. You don't 
know when the strike is going to happen, if it happens," Chicago's Alex 
Fernandez said after the White Sox won the opener of the division showdown 
Thursday night at Cominsky Park, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, pitching on eight days rest, struck out a career-high 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez gave up three runs in the first two innings and then got stronger, 
retiring 13 in a row at one point. He finished with a seven-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twelve strikeouts are 12 outs that I got personally by myself. But strikeouts 
can be overrated. I knew I had a few but I didn't know the number. I was just 
worried about getting the outs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox were last in first when they were tied with the Indians on June 
13. They now lead them by one game, and the teams will meet seven more times in 
the next 10 days and then not again in the regular season. Chicago is 4-1 
against Cleveland this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Ventura's third hit on his 27th birthday was a blooper to left off 
reliever Derek Lilliquist, capping a two-run rally in the seventh, as the White 
Sox rallied from a 3-0 deficit for their seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 3-2 in the seventh against Charles Nagy, the White Sox loaded the 
bases on singles by Norberto Martin and Tim Raines and a walk to Frank Thomas. 
Julio Franco hit a sacrifice fly, and Ventura hit an 0-2 pitch to score Raines. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 2, Oakland 1 -- Roger Clemens pitched his 11th career two-hitter to 
lead the Red Sox at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (8-4), who has won three Cy Young awards but never pitched a 
no-hitter, didn't yield a hit until Ruben Sierra led off the seventh by 
grounding a single through the hole into right. He was within two outs of his 
second career one-hitter when Troy Neel his his 11th homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston scored in the fifth and again in the seventh, and that was more than 
enough run support for Clemens, who has thrown three two-hitters this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 7, Toronto 3 -- Dean Palmer, one of the hittest hitters in the majors, 
doubled in one run and Manuel Lee doubled in two during a four-run second 
inning at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who also hit his 18th homer, is 24-for-64 (.375) in his last 17 games, 
with 10 homers and 20 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who have a four-game lead in the Western Division, have won eight 
of their last 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 6, Minnesota 4 -- Jeff Cirillo, the Brewers' 11th-round draft choice 
in 1991 out of USC, hit a two-run, pinch-hit double with one out in the ninth 
inning at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner Ward and Matt Mieske both hit one-out singles before Cirillo, who was 
batting only .107 (3-for-28) since being called up from triple-A New Orleans, 
got his game-winning hit off reliever Mark Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ignasiak (3-1) pitched two innings of shutout relief for the victory. 
Mike Fetters got the final three outs for his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 5, Detroit 2 -- Kevin Appier yielded two hits in the first inning 
and nothing else through eight to lead the Royals at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Appier (6-6) gave up a leadoff single by Tony Phillips and a two-run homer by 
Travis Fryman, but did not give up another hit to improve his career record 
against the Tigers to 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Joyner, who missed 16 games with a sore shoulder, went had two doubles 
and two RBIs in his first game since coming off the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 10, Seattle 8 -- The Yankees scored four times in the ninth inning at 
the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill's two run double tied the score at 8-8 and a two-run double by 
Mike Stanley scored four runs in the ninth.

FORMER MAJOR LEAGUER CESAR TOVAR DIES AT 54 IN VENEZUELAN HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cesar Tovar, one of only two major leaguers to play all nine positions in a 
game, died Thursday in Venezuela. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Twins, for whom Tovar played from 1965-72, announced his death 
on the Metrodome scoreboard Thursday night and asked for a moment of silence 
before playing Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Tovar will be buried today, said Benpress, the national news agency in 
Venezuela. He died in a hospital in his native Caracas, but the cause of death 
was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 In 12 seasons, Tovar had a batting average of .278 with 46 home runs and 435 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 22, 1968, Tovar played one inning at every position in Minnesota's 
2-1 victory over Oakland. He joined Bert Campaneris, who did it with the Kansas 
City Athletics on Sept. 8, 1965.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; GAME RAINED OUT, DOUBLEHEADER TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A torrential thunderstorm hit Veterans Stadium about 1 1/2 hours before the 
Dodgers' game was to begin against the Philadelphia Phillies Thursday night, 
closing the airport, local highways and eventually postponing the game until 
today, when a doubleheader will be played. The first game begins at 1 p.m. PDT. 
Channel 5 will begin its telecast at 3 p.m., joining the first game in progress 
and continuing through the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies, who were not home for the Fourth of July, were expecting a crowd 
of 50,000 for fireworks, so they waited with hope for a window of calm that was 
supposed to come. This four-game series is also the last meeting between the 
two teams this season, which could complicate a makeup date. But after city 
officials had closed most of Philadelphia, and the police had called the club 
and urged it to postpone the game, the Phillies faced reality and called the 
game at 7:53 p.m. It had been scheduled to start at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Dodgers, who had stretched, taken batting practice in the 
cages, read books and played cards, did what any team would do after a rain 
delay. They visited with rock star Alice Cooper, who was at the stadium to 
promote his new album. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play together in a world series of golf in the winter, so that's how some 
of us know him," said Tom Candiotti, who will start the second game today. "He 
is the nicest guy in the whole world. He's so articulate and a genius, really." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's game was to have been the first of a 13-game, four-city trip for 
the Dodgers, who believe it to be crucial stretch, not only because of the 
pending strike, but because of the consistency they hope to restore to the 
bullpen with the return of Jim Gott.  
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't looking for a .500 trip, this is a huge trip," Gott said. "I feel 
wonderful. I'm in a lot better shape, both mentally and physically, than since 
spring training. I believe the ups and downs that I had with trying to adapt to 
another role the first part of the season are over, and I am looking forward to 
my role as the set-up man to Todd (Worrell)." 
</P>

 Kevin O'Malley, the oldest son of Dodger owner Peter O'Malley, is making his 
first trip with the team. "It's not that I thought I couldn't go on a trip, but 
I didn't think it would be right to get in anybody's way," Kevin said. "I 
wasn't coming until the other night when we ran into Tommy (Lasorda) at dinner, 
and he asked me to come on the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin, 18, attends Penn State University, where as a freshman last season he 
was a varsity catcher. He worked out before the heavy rains with coach Joe 
Ferguson.

 The Dodgers need for a left-handed reliever continues, and so do reports of 
possible trades. Fred Claire, executive vice president, said he has not spoken 
with the Chicago Cubs about Randy Myers or to the New York Mets about John 
Franco. Both relievers are reportedly on the trading block. "I have not spoken 
to the Cubs in some time and am not in a trade discussion at this time," Claire 
said. MARYANN HUDSON

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; STRAWBERRY'S CONTRIBUTION SIMPLY GRAND

<P>
 Darryl Strawberry hit his first major league home run in more than a year, a 
grand slam that helped the San Francisco Giants beat the Montreal Expos, 8-3, 
Thursday night at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended the Expos' five-game winning streak, but they maintained a 
one-game lead over Atlanta in the Eastern Division. The Braves lost to Florida, 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, who had only an infield single in 11 at-bats in his first four 
games with the Giants, also had a run-scoring single in the first inning and a 
leadoff double in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more at-bats I get, the more comfortable I feel," said Strawberry. "I saw 
the ball well tonight for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 His two-out homer off Pedro Martinez in the fifth inning was his first since 
June 8, 1993, when he was with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 He was put on the disabled list 10 days later because of back problems and 
missed the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first four games in San Francisco, I was a little jumpy," Strawberry 
said. "Tonight, I was little more patient. The more work I get, the more I get 
back into the zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants won their season-high fifth consecutive game, all since Strawberry 
joined them last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 They loaded the bases with one out on walks to Darren Lewis and Barry Bonds 
and a single by John Patterson. Martinez struck out Matt Williams before 
Strawberry homered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants scored twice in the first after Martinez hit his 11th batter -- the 
most in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez hit Patterson with a high fastball and Bonds doubled off the top of 
the right-field wall before Williams and Strawberry hit RBI singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl told us he was just around the corner, we just didn't know the corner 
was so short," joked Giant Manager Dusty Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, Atlanta 3 -- The Marlins got to Steve Avery for four runs in the 
first inning and held off the slumping Braves to win their fourth consecutive 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves, meanwhile, lost their second in a row, fifth in seven games and 
10th in 16 games and fell to 2-5 on their current 10-game home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Browne keyed Florida's first inning with his first home run of the 
season and Benito Santiago capped it with a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marlins added a run in the fifth on an RBI double by Jeff Conine, knocking 
out Avery. The left-hander gave up six hits, five runs, three walks and struck 
out six in 4 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 8, Houston 2 -- Astro pitchers threw two run-scoring wild pitches 
and their usually reliable defense broke down during a five-run fifth inning at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates had only four RBIs, with the other four runs coming on the two 
wild pitches, shortstop Andujar Cedeno's error -- only the 53rd in 89 games by 
the second-best defense in the league -- and a double-play grounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie right-hander Jon Lieber (5-4) bounced back after a pair of rough starts 
against Central Division-leading Cincinnati to pitch his first major league 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 4, Cincinnati 3 -- Mark Parent's two-run homer in the seventh inning 
gave the Cubs the lead and they held on for the victory at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent's homer came after John Smiley walked Steve Buechele. Parent hit 
Smiley's first pitch over the left-field wall for a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs added a run in the eighth on consecutive singles by Rey Sanchez, Mark 
Grace and Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 8, St. Louis 1 -- Andres Galarraga hit a two-run homer after a rain 
delay, helping David Nied earn his ninth victory in the Rockies' rout at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga's 26th homer -- which set a Colorado team record, eclipsing the 25 
homers hit by Charlie Hayes last season -- came off reliever Mike Perez in the 
sixth inning and broke a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez (2-3) had replaced starter Vicente Palacios to start the sixth, after 
play had been interrupted for 1 hour 19 minutes because of rain. With one out, 
Dante Bichette collected his third of four singles, and Galarraga followed with 
his homer to left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Nied (9-4) pitched seven innings, allowing four hits and one run. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis' Ozzie Smith set a major league record for career assists by a 
shortstop with 8,018, moving past Luis Aparicio (8,016). 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios failed to get a decision and is now winless in his last eight starts

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; IT TAKES TIME, BUT WHITE SOX CATCH THE INDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a monthlong chase of the Cleveland Indians, the Chicago White Sox are 
back on top in the Central Division. And in this season of uncertainty, they 
know how important that can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be kidding yourself to say this is not a big series. It's big when you 
are going to play another team eight times in 11 games for first. You don't 
know when the strike is going to happen, if it happens," Chicago's Alex 
Fernandez said after the White Sox won the opener of the division showdown 
Thursday night at Comiskey Park, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, pitching on eight days' rest, struck out a career-high 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez gave up three runs in the first two innings and then got stronger, 
retiring 13 in a row at one point. He finished with a seven-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twelve strikeouts are 12 outs that I got personally by myself. But strikeouts 
can be overrated. I knew I had a few, but I didn't know the number. I was just 
worried about getting the outs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox were last in first when they were tied with the Indians on June 
13. They now lead them by one game, and the teams will meet seven more times in 
the next 10 days and then not again in the regular season. Chicago is 4-1 
against Cleveland this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Ventura's third hit on his 27th birthday was a blooper to left off 
reliever Derek Lilliquist, capping a two-run rally in the seventh, as the White 
Sox rallied from a 3-0 deficit for their seventh consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 3-2, in the seventh against Charles Nagy, the White Sox loaded the 
bases on singles by Norberto Martin and Tim Raines and a walk to Frank Thomas. 
Julio Franco hit a sacrifice fly, and Ventura hit an 0-2 pitch to score Raines. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 2, Oakland 1 -- Roger Clemens pitched the 11th two-hitter of his career 
to lead the Red Sox at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (8-4), who has won three Cy Young awards but never pitched a 
no-hitter, didn't yield a hit until Ruben Sierra led off the seventh by 
grounding a single through the hole into right. He was within two outs of his 
second one-hitter when Troy Neel his his 11th homer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox scored in the fifth and again in the seventh, and that was more 
than enough run support for Clemens, who has pitched three two-hitters this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 7, Toronto 3 -- Dean Palmer, one of the hottest hitters in the majors, 
doubled in one run and Manuel Lee doubled in two more during a four-run second 
inning at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who also hit his 18th homer, is 24 for 64 (.375) in his last 17 games, 
with 10 homers and 20 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who have a four-game lead in the Western Division, have won eight 
of their last 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 6, Minnesota 4 -- Jeff Cirillo, the Brewers' 11th-round draft choice 
in 1991 from USC, hit a two-run, pinch-hit double with one out in the ninth 
inning at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner Ward and Matt Mieske both hit one-out singles before Cirillo, who was 
batting only .107 (three for 28) since being called up from triple-A New 
Orleans, got his game-winning hit off reliever Mark Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 5, Detroit 2 -- Kevin Appier yielded two hits in the first inning 
and nothing else through eight to lead the Royals at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Appier (6-6) gave up a leadoff single by Tony Phillips and a two-run homer by 
Travis Fryman, but did not give up another hit to improve his record against 
the Tigers to 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Joyner, who missed 16 games with a sore shoulder, had two doubles and 
two RBIs in his first game since coming off the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 10, Seattle 8 -- The Yankees used four doubles to score seven runs in 
the ninth inning to beat the Mariners in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill's two-run double tied the score at 8-8 and a two-run double by 
Mike Stanley scored four runs in the ninth.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; RYAN WILL ATTEND SERVICE FOR REESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nolan Ryan, who named his second son after Jimmie Reese because of his deep 
admiration for the late Angel coach, said he will attend today's memorial 
service for Reese in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't begin to tell you how much he meant to me," said Ryan from his Texas 
home. "He was a very special part of my life and always will be. When you think 
of the Angels, you think of him. I don't think that will ever change." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, baseball's all-time strikeout leader, was the man responsible for 
keeping Reese in the organization under General Manager Harry Daulton. Daulton 
had brought Reese to spring training, and after camp ended, Ryan went to 
Daulton and said: "This guy is too good. Keep him." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. played in his 1,984th consecutive 
game, moving closer to Lou Gehrig's immortal record, but said Thursday that his 
streak pales in comparison to that of Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've done doesn't even approach what he has done," Ripken said. "I don't 
think anyone can compare my achievements to his. You didn't even have to meet 
him to be amazed by him." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Angels finally gave up on left-handed reliever Jerry Nielsen and traded 
him to the Chicago White Sox for double-A pitcher Dean Locklear. Nielsen 
actually delayed the Jim Abbott-J.T. Snow trade until the New York Yankees 
included him along with starter Russ Springer, but Nielsen was a 
disappointment. He yielded a 8.03 earned-run average in 10 games with the 
Angels last season, and this year was 1-2 with a 7.65 ERA at double-A Midland. 
The Angels also acquired outfielder Bo Ortiz to complete their June 14 trade 
that sent Dwight Smith to the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Carew, Angel hitting coach, was stunned upon hearing that former teammate 
Cesar Tovar, 54, died in Venezuela because of pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what to say because it's such a shock," said Carew, who 
was a teammate of seven years while with the Minnesota Twins. "He was the 
sparkplug of our team. He was the one who always got us going. He was such a 
very good friend. Caesar, me, (Tony) Oliva did everything together. Those guys 
were like big brothers to me." BOB NIGHTENGALE

 "In the second half, Brazil prayed. . . . At that moment, all that was missing 
was one simple goal.The Swedes closed ranks in defense in a clear attempt to 
send the game to a decision by penalty kicks. In normal times, we ought to 
respect the weak. But that little dance by the goalie (Thomas) Ravelli, 
laughing at the television cameras, was demonic. Little Saint Romario's goal 
off a cross-field pass by the latter day sinner Jorginho brought to mind once 
again the phrase by which some people have grown accustomed to the good and bad 
things of life: God is Brazilian."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; SPOTLIGHT; IT WOULD BE COSTLY

 While British papers were jammed with accounts of the triumphs of Italy and 
Brazil late Wednesday, the Daily Telegraph of London reported that soccer fans 
in the Falkland Islands will "be praying the World Cup final does not go to 
extra time, or, heaven forbid, penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Sunday's game will be the first World Cup to be shown live on 
television to the far-flung outpost of the Empire, which until now has followed 
the World Cup via BBC's World Service radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The television satellite link for Sunday has been set up by the British Forces 
Broadcasting Service and the islands' civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000 British troops stationed in the Falklands since the successful 
ouster of Argentine forces in the 1982 war have covered most of the 
$1,500-an-hour cost of televising Sunday's match, aided by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 But an overtime would make the cost soar.

 If Italy beats Brazil on Sunday, it will be the first time a European team has 
won a World Cup outside its own continent. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the Brazilians win, their spectacular striker, Romario, says they 
will owe a debt of gratitude to Europe because so many of them play there 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Determination and fighting spirit, that is something we have learned from the 
European game," says Romario, who played five seasons for PSV Eindhoven in the 
Netherlands before moving to FC Barcelona in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're never going to forget that our technique will always be Brazilian."

 Francisco Marcos, commissioner of the U.S. Interregional Soccer League and 
liaison for the Brazilian team here, has a 3-year-old with six names. 
</P>
<P>
 To honor his family and his wife, Marcos named his son Julian Marcos Clem Ward 
Isidoro Bicho. The first two "are his stage name," said Marcos, a native 
Brazilian who lives in Dallas. "His passport has them all.

<P>
 "He's Texan, Portuguese and American. He will be the first guy eligible to 
play for three countries, because by the time he grows up, Texas will be a 
republic." HELENE ELLIOTT

 The dumbest question of Thursday -- and perhaps of the tournament -- was asked 
of Brazilian Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira after his team's practice.

<P>
 Referring to Sunday's final against Italy, one reporter earnestly inquired, 
"Do you want to win the game?" 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira, who speaks English well, couldn't believe his ears. "What kind of

the decision of an epoch, to determine the first quadra-champion of the Cup, a 
match up of three-time champions and a reprise of 1970, when Brazil last got 
this far (and won 4 to 1).And it is Brazil vs. Italy, one of the greatest

 From coast to coast, the cops have been great during this World Cup.In

 In the Meadowlands, the New Jersey State police never abandoned their 
long-sleeved blue woolen shirts, despite the oppressive heat, nor did they ever 
turn away from their crowd-watching to sneak a peek at the field. Nor did the 
cops in Orlando waver from their crowd-watching duties, but in the wild 
evenings at Church Street Station, they were good sports until the wee hours, 
smiling at attempts to steal their OPD (Orlando Police Department) caps. BILL

 Many of the really important parts of the World Cup are economic. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the organizers were hit with the failure of teams with huge fan bases 
to qualify -- England, France and Japan. Then, teams with relatively shallow 
pockets advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria, for one. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup chairman Alan Rothenberg joked about Bulgaria's economic impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bulgaria cost us a lot of money," he said. "They kept France out in the first 
place (during qualifying), and then they knocked out Argentina and Mexico. Do 
you know how many T-shirts and novelties Bulgarians buy?" JULIE CART

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; SPOTLIGHT; PARREIRA STANDS BY HIS SYSTEM; 
SOCCER: BRAZIL'S COACH HAS BEEN HEAVILY CRITICIZED, BUT HE FEELS VINDICATED 
BECAUSE HIS TEAM HAS RARELY BEEN THREATENED DURING THE TOURNAMENT.

 The competition was fierce. Elbows were high, every inch of territory was a 
precious gain and obstacles were surmounted without thought of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters attending Brazil's World Cup practice Thursday at Cal State 
Fullerton fought harder for position than did the players, who went through a 
casual workout in preparation for Sunday's championship game against Italy at 
the Rose Bowl. Only a few regulars participated, among them midfielder Rai and 
goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel, and they were hotly pursued by about 400 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police, pressed into crowd-control duty on short notice, used 
handcuffs to secure the gate leading to the field. At one point, a player 
identified as defender Ricardo Rocha yelled at a group of Brazilian reporters, 
who were said to be dissatisfied with the sparse player turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't enough players to go around," said Francisco Marcos, the 
Brazilian team's liaison and translator. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira was also in a contentious mood, although 
he was far more cordial than his players. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after guiding Brazil to a 1-0 victory over Sweden and its first 
berth in the final since 1970, Parreira again had to defend his strategy 
against charges that it is too rigid for players to display their individual 
flair. He has received unsolicited advice from everyone ranging from his mother 
-- she wants to see teen-age sensation Ronaldo make his debut -- to Pele to 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco. 
</P>
<P>
 "One problem is, we've got rock personalities, artists and musicians writing 
about soccer," Parreira said. "Indeed, there has been quite a bit of 
(criticism) but I'm not going to lower myself to that level. I'm not going to 
bother myself with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira has noticed that he and Italy's Arrigo Sacchi, who have probably been 
subjected to the most second-guessing of all the coaches here, have led their 
teams to the final despite their supposed shortcomings. To Parreira, who has 
called his job "a death sentence," their success is sweet vindication. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a conservative medium, ambience, it is difficult to bring anything new," 
he said through Marcos' translation. "When passion enters the arena, things 
become even more difficult. The important thing for Sacchi and myself is that 
we believe in what we are doing and we follow that road right to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am looking at Brazil's performance, and I don't remember a team ever 
reaching the final without being threatened. I'm happy that our way (of 
coaching) is being shown to be the correct way." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he ever doubted himself, he responded in English. "Never," he said. 
"Not one line was changed, even from the qualifying rounds. That is my personal 
satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira said the free-flowing, free-lance approach of previous Brazilian 
teams would not work because, except for Romario and Bebeto, his players' 
skills don't equal those of the 1970 championship squad. However, he scoffed at 
claims that he has shackled his players.  
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be more organization because soccer is no longer the same," he 
said. "We don't have, like 1970, five superstar types, so we could just get by 
with technique and talent, so the team has to be more organized, more 
disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the most balanced team in the tournament. We are the most efficient 
team. . . . . We have not been threatened by any team in any of the games."

BRITISH OPEN / DAILY REPORT; ODDS ON WATSON HAVE ATTRACTED SOME HEFTY BETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Listen hard around Turnberry, Scotland, and you can hear the wringing of hands 
at the Coral bookmakers' shops. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Tom Watson is only three strokes off the lead and talking as if 
he can win the British Open. If he does, Coral stands to lose 1.5 million 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I making the bookies nervous?" Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson wouldn't say if he had bet on himself, but if smiles count for anything 
he probably did. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances reminded Watson of a story told him recently by Lee Trevino. 
It seems Trevino went to Muirfield in 1972 to defend his British Open title and 
took with him 12 friends from the United States. The friends went to the local 
bookies, took advantage of the unusually high odds for a defending champion, 
and then watched as Trevino won the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had suitcases full of money," Watson said. "Literally, suitcases full." 
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's round, Watson's odds had dropped to 14-1. He was at 50-1 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So much for aura. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Jonathan Lomas and Loren Roberts are playing in their first British Open, 
though you wouldn't have known it Thursday. Lomas shot a 66, Roberts, who 
finished second at the recent U.S. Open, a 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1980, before Roberts was even a touring pro, he went to Muirfield and 
tried to qualify for the Open. He missed and never returned. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of regret that decision now," he said. "I wish I would have come over 
sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts found British Open religion, all right. He now calls the tournament 
"the championship of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't bother mentioning nationalism to Andrew Magee. Asked if he thought a 
victory here by an American was meaningful, Magee waved no flags. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not representing the United States," he said. "I'm representing me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Faldo's two-stroke gaffe on No. 17 wasn't the first time that sort of 
thing has happened to him. Back in the 1970s, Faldo mistakenly hit the wrong 
ball during a tournament in South Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 This time he hit playing partner Jim McGovern's ball. It happened after their 
drives settled about 20 yards apart. Faldo walked up to the ball but couldn't 
see his identifying logo. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could see was white," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring it had to be his ball, Faldo whacked away. Error. 
</P>
<P>
 The third player in the threesome, Ernie Els, called it "very unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman was less charitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always bend over and check," said Norman, who suggested that a player can 
always bend a few blades of grass to check for the logo mark. "It's just one of 
those deals you should be meticulous about." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Norman: "The game of golf is a four-letter word. I'm sure a few 
four-letter words were said out there." GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI

arrived at Keeneland in July of 1985. In a matter of minutes, a yearling son of 
Nijinsky II sold for a record $13.1 million, with a group headed by England's 
Robert Sangster outbidding the late Gene Klein and his partners. Klein, it was 
said, wanted to go on in the bidding but was outvoted. 
</P>
<P>
 Money was being thrown around so freely that summer that when Mike Rutherford 
bought a filly for $2.7 million a couple of weeks later at Saratoga, he 
couldn't even get his picture in the Daily Racing Form. A sister of the 
undefeated Saratoga Six and from the same family that produced Kentucky 
Derby-Belmont Stakes winner Bold Forbes, this daughter of Alydar and Priceless 
Fame was called Milliardaire. She never lost a race. 
</P>
<P>
 But she ran in only two -- a couple of starts at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, 
Ark., that were worth $17,400. Her combined winning margins were 13 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was tough, not being able to race her anymore," Rutherford said. "She 
didn't get to the races until she was a 4-year-old, and then the vets told us 
that she had such a bad lung infection that it would have been risky to keep 
running her." 
</P>
<P>
 Milliardaire became a broodmare, with no problems, at Rutherford's 275-acre 
farm not far from Keeneland in Lexington, Ky., and now, with her second foal 
and first by Triple Crown champion Seattle Slew, she has given the world 
Lakeway, the best 3-year-old filly in the country. Out of left field, and well 
after the fact, Rutherford's $2.7-million gamble has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Commended for his patience, he said, "Patience, hell. I just got lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway is so good that Rutherford and his Hollywood Park trainer, Gary Jones, 
are considering whether to run her in the $200,000 Alabama Stakes, against 
fillies, at Saratoga on Aug. 13, or wait for the $750,000 Travers there on Aug. 
20. The Travers hasn't been won by a filly in 79 years, and this year the field 
will be as tough as ever, with the speedy Holy Bull and Tabasco Cat, the winner 
of the Preakness and the Belmont, expected to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford, a 54-year-old second-generation oilman from Houston, will make the 
call, and the guess here is that he will send Lakeway into the Travers, which 
at 1 1/4 miles is the same distance as the Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Racing fillies against colts is frequently folly, as it would have been had 
Rutherford and Jones run Lakeway in the Kentucky Derby, but the Travers makes 
sense. Lakeway would not jeopardize her leadership in the filly division, no 
matter where she finished, and if she somehow won the race, Rutherford's horse 
would turn into a bona fide candidate for the horse-of-the-year title as well. 
She has much to gain and nothing to lose in the Travers. In the Alabama, she 
would gain little by winning and would lose a lot if someone knocked her off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how, if she stopped right now, they could deny she's the best 
3-year-old filly in the country," Jones said. "So we might try to do something 
even more. We'll see how the Travers shapes up." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford has this gnawing feeling that New Yorkers don't appreciate horses 
from the other side of the country. Rebounding from her only loss, by a head to 
Sardula in the Kentucky Oaks, Lakeway traveled to Belmont Park in mid-June and 
beat the favorite, the New York-based Inside Information, while winning the 
Mother Goose Stakes by 4 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, there were reports from trainer Shug McGaughey's barn that Inside 
Information was in season -- going through an ovarian cycle -- the day of the 
Mother Goose, and her performance could have been affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that other filly was horsin'," Rutherford said sarcastically. "I wonder if 
Patrick Ewing was horsin' the night the (Houston) Rockets beat the (New York) 
Knicks to win the NBA title." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford has been breeding horses for 20 years and can be excused for being 
so fervid about his first potential champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She broke a stakes record, the first stake she ever ran in," he said, 
referring to the Las Virgenes early this year at Santa Anita. "Then she broke 
the stakes record for that race in New York. Now she's run in a race that's 
almost 50 years old (the Hollywood Oaks), and she's broken that record, too. 
Did Ruffian ever do all this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Lakeway did run the Mother Goose 1 2/5 seconds faster than Ruffian, but 
in 1975 the stake was run at Aqueduct, and Ruffian, winning by 14 lengths, also 
broke the stakes record while reaching the finish line in a gallop. If Mike 
Rutherford really wants to get New York's attention, all he has to do is show 
up at Saratoga comparing his filly to Ruffian. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the Lasix won't be a problem (at Saratoga)," Rutherford said. "She 
ran in the Mother Goose without it, and it didn't bother her." 
</P>
<P>
 In winning six out of seven starts, Lakeway has been treated with the 
anti-bleeding diuretic for all her races but the one in New York, where 
race-day medication is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Milliardaire, the latest member of her family is a filly by Dayjur, who 
arrived earlier this year. Then for the third time, Milliardaire was bred to 
Seattle Slew, a mating that took place on May 7, Kentucky Derby day. Lakeway's 
brother or sister couldn't have had a better start. Horse Racing Notes

 Casual Lies, a $7,500 yearling who was second, third and fifth, respectively, 
in the 1992 Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont, has been sold by her owner 
and trainer, Shelley Riley, to a New Zealand breeder for a reported $700,000. 
Casual Lies' purses totaled $795,991. . . . Soviet Problem, who has won 10 of 
13 starts, makes her second start on grass Saturday in the $100,000 Valkyr 
Handicap for California-breds at Hollywood Park. The 5 1/2-furlong race has 
drawn nine starters. Soviet Problem will carry 125 pounds, spotting the 
opposition nine to 17 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valkyr will be the last race in the National Best Seven. One of the other 
races is the $300,000 Frank J. De Francis Memorial Dash at Laurel, where 
Cherokee Run is the 2-1 morning-line favorite. Others in the 11-horse field are 
You and I, who is 9-2, and Individual Style, at 6-1. . . . Sandy Shulman, who 
is battling Ron McAnally for the training title at Hollywood Park, ended an 
0-for-21 streak Thursday when Onceinabluemamoon won the fifth race. Shulman 
also saddled Snowy River Miss, the ninth-race winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mittens and Mink won her second race while in foal. Miss High Blade, also in 
foal, has won twice at the meeting and Splendid Dream has won once. . . . 
Fanmore, second to Slew Of Damascus in the Hollywood Gold Cup, is scheduled to 
return to grass and run in the $250,000 Arlington Handicap on Aug. 7.

MOVIE RAGS TO RICHES; AT AN AUCTION OF FILM COSTUMES, A COAT WORN BY RUDOLPH 
VALENTINO IS EXPECTED TO BRING $15,000 OR MORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In the coronation scene in "Desiree," Marlon Brando wore an outfit worthy of 
an emperor. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on David's famous paint ing of Napoleon's actual coronation, the 
40-year-old costume includes a crimson robe embroidered with golden bees, lined 
with white fur and ermine tails, and sporting a train worthy of a royal bride. 
From the "Star Collection" of Western Costume in North Hollywood, the imperial 
ensemble is a sartorial showstopper, evidence of what the people who dress the 
stars can do when they spare neither effort nor expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's of regal proportions," costume expert Glenn Brown says of the Rene 
Hubert design. And it's also on the block, one of more than 300 pieces from the 
Western Costume collection that will be auctioned Sunday at Butterfield & 
Butterfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who is the specialist on memorabilia at the Hollywood auction house, 
expects the coronation robes to bring more than the $12,000 to $15,000 pre-sale 
estimate. "Costumes of a military or historic nature tend to go higher," he 
says. Among those who have already expressed interest in the costume, which 
includes a pair of cream satin boots and a gold laurel wreath, are two museums. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brown, more people than ever are interested in collecting pieces 
of Hollywood history. He estimates that there are more than 100 major players 
in the Hollywood costume field and hundreds more with smaller collections. 
Brown himself is a veteran collector whose coups include paying $1 at an MGM 
sale for a simple gingham dress that turned out to be the one Judy Garland wore 
in "The Wizard of Oz" when she sang "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." Brown later 
sold it at auction for $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Costume is the oldest and largest supplier of costumes to the 
entertainment industry. Founded in 1912 to provide authentic Indian costumes to 
William S. Hart's pioneer film company, it is perhaps best known as the maker 
of Dorothy's ruby slippers. Famous for being able to costume casts of 
thousands, it lent thousands of military uniforms to the California National 
Guard when it was caught short in the wake of Pearl Harbor. The company has 5 
million items for rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's event is a sequel to the first "Star Collection" sale in October. At 
that auction, a dress worn by Vivien Leigh in "Gone With the Wind" (the 
traveling suit Scarlett wore during her traumatic ride through Shantytown) sold 
for $33,350, a record for the 1939 film. A brown velvet jacket that adorned 
Errol Flynn in "Captain Blood" brought $31,050. The sailor suits and dresses 
worn by the terminally adorable Von Trapp kiddies in "The Sound of Music" were 
bid up to $19,550. And a person who can only be described as a real Kirk 
Douglas fan paid $3,450 for one of his loincloths from "Spartacus." Items at 
that first "Star Collection" sale sold for a total of more than $590,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gone With the Wind" fans will find nothing as spectacular as Scarlett's suit 
in Sunday's sale, but there are some wonderful bonnets worn by Leigh and Olivia 
de Havilland as Melanie. And there is a handsome set of clothes designed by 
Walter Plunkett for Clark Cable in his role as Rhett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gable ensemble includes a pair of striped wool trousers labeled "Eddie 
Schmidt 4/17/39." As Hollywood memorabilia expert and collector James Comisar 
explains, Gable was unhappy with his first "GWTW" costumes -- he said they fit 
him like a potato sack -- and claimed that he wouldn't report for work until 
Schmidt, his personal tailor, re-cut them. Gable did not wear the pants, shirt 
and fancy black vest together in the film, which diminishes their value for the 
most demanding collectors. But, as Brown points out, "GWTW" costumes are 
extremely hard to come by since most are owned by the family of the epic's 
producer, the late David O. Selznick. Brown thinks that the ensemble will 
exceed the pre-sale estimate of $6,000 to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Material relating to the late Errol Flynn has become increasingly valuable in 
recent years, enhanced by the actor's rakish reputation as much as his 
on-screen charisma, according to Brown. There has been considerable pre-sale 
interest in a forest guy shirt (green, needless to say) that Flynn wore while 
stealing from the rich to give to the poor in "The Adventures of Robin Hood" 
(1938). Several of Flynn's jackets and a pair of breeches he wore in "The 
Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex" (1939) will also be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the big-ticket items in Sunday's auction: Rudolph Valentino's 
burgundy-and-silver coat, probably from "Son of the Sheik" (1926), which is 
expected to bring $15,000 or more. A navy blue frock coat worn by Orson Welles 
in "Citizen Kane" (1941) is also expected to attract collectors who can afford 
to pay $12,000 or more for an important garment from a great movie. And then 
there are the green-and-white costumes worn by the Von Trapp darlings in "The 
Sound of Music" (1965). The so-called "drapery costumes," which have a pre-sale 
estimate of $7,000, are expected to trigger brisk bidding, given their special 
role in the film. These are the play clothes that Maria (Julie Andrews), fresh 
out of the convent and hired as governess to the Von Trapps, whips up for her 
new charges from the draperies in her bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Intriguing items with pre-sale estimates of $1,500 or less include Charlie 
Chaplin's armband from "The Great Dictator," Gary Cooper's baseball knickers 
from "Pride of the Yankees" and an Elizabeth Taylor bustier. The last item, 
Brown says, is pale pink silk, with a plunging neckline, extensively wired 
throughout "to push and shove." 
</P>
<P>
 In preparing for the two Western Costume sales, a major task was sifting 
through the company's vast holdings in search of significant clothes and 
accessories. Since Western is a busy, working costume house, the kinds of 
records archivists long for were rarely kept. Sometimes stars' names were sewn 
into their costumes, but not always. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, whose personal collection includes five choice gowns from "Marie 
Antoinette" (1937), had to become a sartorial sleuth while helping to select 
items for the auction. His collector's sense began to tingle when he came 
across a cream silk bolero jacket trimmed with black soutache that had the look 
of a star but no label. "When you've been doing this as long as I have, you get 
sort of psychic about these things," he says. "And this thing was talking to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 So Brown went looking for a bolero in a haystack, riffling through movie still 
after movie still, costume-test photo after costume-test photo, hoping to catch 
a glimpse of the tantalizing jacket. Then, there it was, worn by Bette Davis, 
in what Brown calls "one of her many comebacks" -- the 1964 chiller "Hush Hush 
. . . Sweet Charlotte." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was nominated for an Oscar for costume design.  
</P>
<P>
 Women's costumes are almost always easier to identify than men's, Brown says. 
"Men's contemporary clothing is one of the hardest things to do documentation 
and research on." The reason: "A black mohair suit is a black mohair suit."

ELECTRIC GUITARIST; JAMIE GLASER DEVOTES HIS SEEMINGLY BOUNDLESS ENERGY TO 
PLAYING FOR FILM AND TV SOUNDTRACKS, COMPOSING AND PERFORMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't ask Jamie Glaser to stand still. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a chair, talking, his brown eyes flash; his body moves animatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Then give him his guitar, and even with the instrument unplugged as he poses 
for a photograph, Glaser bends forward, leans back, keeps a patter going with 
his feet, smiles, mugs. He's kinetic energy personified. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser, a renowned instrumentalist who has played with Jean-Luc Ponty, Chick 
Corea, Manhattan Transfer, Bryan Adams and many, many more, quickly tells you 
he doesn't drink coffee or eat sugar. The pulsing is from music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so fortunate to be in my position, to be doing what I want, that I'm 
about to explode," he says. "Music is language that's universal, that's about 
joy and happiness, and I believe I'm a messenger for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser, 39, who performs Thursday at La Ve Lee, is a busy guy. His primary 
musical activity is working for film and TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially an acoustic bassist, he has played his guitar on such shows as 
"Seinfeld" -- dropping in the "thrash" guitar parts that the character Kramer 
dances around to -- "Double Rush," "Someone Like Me," "Dynasty" and a hundred 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, he's been writing music for such shows as "World's Most Dangerous 
Stunts," which aired on the Fox network in March, and the upcoming Discovery 
series, "World of Wonder," which he whimsically calls " 'Ripley's Believe It Or 
Not,' 'That's Incredible!' and the 'Guinness Book of World Records' all stuck 
together." It debuts in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser, who has a degree in composition from the Berklee College of Music, 
says the show is his first series. He is composing the orchestral score with 
his writing partner, Walter Werzowa. 
</P>
<P>
 When Glaser has finished a week of grueling -- though very rewarding -- studio 
commitments, does he relax at home with a beer and video? No way. He spends 
most of his weekends playing casuals -- from bar mitzvahs to weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to play," he says, "and I'd rather be playing than watching TV or 
whatever. And these jobs keep my ears fresh, and they keep me modern by having 
to know all the new music." 
</P>
<P>
 Casuals are a great way to network, he says. "My best TV work has all come 
from people I have met on casuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser notes that his fruitful relationship with Jonathan Wolff -- the 
composer who has hired the guitarist for work on the soundtracks for 
"Seinfeld," "Married . . . With Children," "Perfect Strangers" and more -- 
started when they played at a casual 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser does cool down a bit when he does the rare live date, like Thursday at 
La Ve Lee. "I do that simply to have some fun," he says. "I call the group 
'Jamie and the No-Concept Band,' because we'll play heavy metal, jazz-fusion, 
sambas. I like all different grooves, and I'm there to entertain, give the 
listeners a fun night." 
</P>
<P>
 La Ve Lee owner Eddie Arbi enjoys Glaser's show, saying, "He offers something 
new. He plays with a lot of energy, and he goes with the music when he plays." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Long Island, N.Y., Glaser took up guitar at the age of 9 and never 
looked back. His father, Hy Glaser, was a songwriter -- he wrote "The Lonely 
Hours," sung by Frank Sinatra -- and exposed his son to pop music. Then Glaser 
discovered jazz, via the speedy playing of John MacLaughlin and Al DiMeola, 
while attending Berklee, from which he graduated in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after graduation, Glaser was called by violinist Ponty, who was already a 
major musical figure, and after an audition, he joined Ponty's band for a 
performance in Ohio. It's a moment the guitarist will always carry with him, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was young and ready," Glaser recalls. "I walked on stage, and I had this 
feeling that my career had really begun. Right now, the meaning of those words 
chokes me up. I can feel it as if it were yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 In his desire to share his knowledge of the inner workings of the music world, 
Glaser has put together a two-hour audiocassette he calls "The Musician's 
Career Supercharger System." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something for my fellow musicians," he says. (The tape, which

A TALE OF LOVE AND VIOLENCE; 'DIRTY MUSTARD' TELLS THE STORY OF A MAN AND A 
WOMAN TRAPPED IN A DESTRUCTIVE, ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.

 When Gina Wendkos finished writing "Dirty Mustard" a few months ago, there was 
no O.J. Simpson murder case. Domestic abuse was not a hot topic. But suddenly, 
her story about a man and woman locked in a destructive, violent relationship 
has become very timely. 
</P>
<P>
 "The characters are two misfits who find each other against all odds in a bar 
-- and they're both completely hellbent on destruction," explains the 
playwright, whose work had its world premiere this week at the Alliance 
Repertory Theatre. "It's the typical push-pull rhythm of a romance: He pursues 
her; she resists. Then she falls in love with him, he kicks her out. Then after 
he kicks her out, he wants her back." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of them comes to the relationship with a fair amount of emotional 
baggage. "She's a character who's bitter and negative and fearful and 
self-mocking," Wendkos says. "He doesn't take anybody or anything seriously, 
and he toys with her affections. Neither one of them has a big belief in love. 
Yet he falls in love with her, he's drawn to her. That's why he punches her -- 
'cause he wants to destroy her. Because being in love with her weakens him." 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Suzan Fellman, who aggressively pursued Wendkos to get the rights to 
the play, describes the work as "a beautiful love story -- but it is hard, 
street. Nothing is padded." She describes her character Jamie as "a child 
that's never grown up, a lost soul. The only person with her in the world is 
this man. They love like hell and fight like hell; they don't know any middle 
ground. They're like two little brats. But their demons are quite yummy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the characters are fictional, the playwright acknowledges that she 
has experienced an emotionally abusive relationship. "I think people should 
talk about it," says Wendkos, who has been a writer-producer at TriStar 
Television since 1991. "I was so embarrassed by it that I wouldn't admit it to 
anybody. It was like, 'Wait a minute, I'm this tough New Yorker, it can't 
happen to me.' And then it happened to me -- and it happened to me by a guy who 
was so insignificant, such a little worm." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Wendkos sought therapy -- where, incredibly, she said, she was 
made to feel that she was blowing her boyfriend's violence out of proportion. 
In spite of that experience, she wishes therapy were more available to other 
women suffering domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average woman can't afford it," she says. "The average hausfrau in 
Michigan with six kids is too busy dealing. I'm thinking to myself, 'Here I am: 
I'm single, with money, with a future' -- and I couldn't find myself out of it. 
Women get killed 'cause the system doesn't support them. This whole O.J. thing 
is so traumatic for me because it's an echo." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Italy and raised in New York, Wendkos arrived in Los Angeles in 1987, 
where she made a splash on the theater circuit with "Boys and Girls / Men and 
Women" and "Personality," quickly followed by "Dinosaurs" and "Ginger Ale 
Afternoon" -- the latter she also wrote as a film. Her next film, "The Tiger 
Within," starring Max Von Sydow in the relationship story of a Holocaust 
survivor and a teen-age skinhead, begins production this fall with director 
Robert Greenwald. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily engaged now to Universal Pictures marketing chief Perry Katz, Wendkos 
believes that "Dirty Mustard" airs a lot of dirty laundry: "This play is truly 
scary, because it says things about love you don't want to think about. I'm 
even afraid to have my boyfriend see it, because I don't want him to be grossed 
out." She sighs. "I don't believe I'm the only person to ever experience the 
sadness of romance. I think romance can be a sad business. You try and glean 
the joy from it that you can, but if you enter into it with any honesty or 
vulnerability, you better have a good relationship with God." Where and When

THEATER REVIEW; REFRESHING LAUGHS ON TAP; 'ACME GENUINE DRAFT' FEATURES 
SUCCESSFULLY WRITTEN AND DELIVERED SKETCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Acme Genuine Draft" is chiseled, clever, scripted sketch comedy. In fact, the 
4-year-old Acme Players, performing at their North Hollywood Acme Comedy 
Theatre, are so talented, the company is even superior to Los Angeles' revered 
Groundlings troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 Acme might have once been second-string to the Groundlings, but no more. Of 
course, to be fair, unlike the Groundlings, the Acme Players don't do risky 
improv (although they have an improv workshop). Instead, a dozen actor-writers, 
forming the most veteran of three separate Acme companies, alternately peel off 
19 sketches in under two hours, each of them characterized by terrific writing, 
and developed and polished to the nub. 
</P>
<P>
 All the actors perform with panache, but it is the women who really shine. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of Angelenos who have barely heard of the Acme Players, 
producer-director M. D. Sweeney guides Greater Los Angeles' hottest comedy 
theater, propelled by its inventive sketch material, which never seems a second 
longer or shorter than it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceptually, the material is refreshing. Social and political subtexts are 
buried so deep that they're almost impossible to detect. Instead, we get Batman 
and Robin (Ralph Garman and Byrne Offutt) in hilariously exact comic-book 
wardrobes, handcuffed, hauled into court on a felony rap for assault and denied 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Valedictorian," Susie Geiser is a squirming, casually foul-tongued Valley 
girl delivering the main banal speech at her North Hollywood Extension High 
School graduation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Duet," Garman's laid-back Frank Sinatra (who's a touch forgetful) and 
Antoinette Spolar's shrieking, straining Liza Minnelli unveil a bizarre lounge 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably the evening's highlight is a marital relationship number, "Yahtzee," 
in which two couples settle down for a game of Yahtzee. However, one couple 
(Jerry Collins and Robyn Donny) treat the game as all-out grimacing warfare, 
while the other characters (Spolar and Offutt) fear for their lives as they 
roll up the points. 
</P>
<P>
 Other topics include fickle lovers, a guy practicing his trumpet and driving 
his neighbors berserk, a photographer shooting a magazine cover girl, a 
Catholic school bingo game for aging spouses, two waiters auditioning for a 
job, a nervous computer hacker afraid to leave his room, smeary ribs (yes, 
smeary ribs) and a curtain call that is unquestionably the most unusual curtain 
call in theater history.  
</P>
<P>
 Live keyboard accompaniment by Jonathan Green gives the satire and wit a 
propulsive musical accent. The only mediocrities are the untextured lighting 
and bland set design. On the other hand, the 48-seat house is whistle-clean, 
for one inviting show. Where and When

IN THE EYE OF BEHOLDER; THE BURBANK EXHIBIT FEATURES THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL 
WORKS OF 13 ARTISTS AND INCLUDES CERAMICS, TAPESTRY AND JEWELRY. IT CROSSES THE 
LINE 'BETWEEN ART AND CRAFT.' 
</P>

<P>
 When is a ceramic pot just a pot and when is it art? That question has been 
the subject of intense debate among artists, scholars and collectors throughout 
the second half of the 20th Century. The answer is not always clear. Often it 
lies in the eye of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Creative Arts Center, one can behold a range of ceramic works as well 
as fiber art pieces. One can join in the discussion of what constitutes art, or 
just enjoy the compelling shapes, textures and colors of the objects in the 
show, "Art From the Third Dimension." 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 70 pieces -- of fiber sculpture, wearable art, tapestry, 
jewelry, paper works and ceramics -- represent the work of 13 artists from the 
Third Dimension Portfolio Group, an arts group founded in 1980 and affiliated 
with the Palos Verdes Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different show than what we've been traditionally showing," said 
Carol Finkle, who runs the Creative Arts Center gallery. "We were impressed 
with (the group's) work, the variety of media and their use of media. It's 
crossed the line between art and craft, and that's a tough line to cross. You 
wouldn't put a plant in their pots." 
</P>
<P>
 Finkle also was intrigued by the diverse approaches of the six ceramists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each in their own way is so lovely, but so totally different," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Fuller uses the ceramic medium to make breastplates, shields and helmets 
that look like they are made from metal. Although they recall the days of merry 
old England in battle, there is a sly, humorous quality about them that 
suggests the folly of warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The substantial abstract ceramic works by Leonard Rubenstein present his 
notions of "Habitat," "Fertility" and "Ego." One can approach the 40-inch-tall 
"Ego" from various angles. From one view, it looks like a penguin. "You get 
different feelings from it, depending on where you come from," Finkle said. She 
sees Fuller and Rubenstein's work as particularly masculine. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Napolitan's black stoneware and porcelain plate, "Eddy," contains sensuous 
curves that draw the viewer toward it. "Each of my ceramic pieces takes on a 
'mood' which reflects my own state of mind at the time it is being created. . . 
. I love chasing the graceful form and the clean line as well as the challenge 
of decorating, glazing, firing," Napolitan writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Harris gathers up plant fibers such as bark and kelp in Southern 
California and in Mexico to create basket-like pieces that evoke the seashores 
and other natural environments where she finds the objects. "Primitive Vessel" 
conveys the abundance of nature in its cornucopia-like form. The vase-like 
"Windsong" offers a higher, more refined natural vision. "Collection Pod II," 
with its gourds, holds some of the appealing bounty of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' work demonstrates "the difference between weaving a basket and having 
a piece of art," Finkle said. "They're so beautifully done." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Barnes Baker's wearable pieces entice the viewer with their rich colors 
and flowing shapes. The butterfly-like "Morphidae" and the three other pieces 
on view are made of silk, dye and textile paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan McGehee has taken to weaving with wire, "to use late 20th-Century 
materials, primarily from the electronics industry, to create pieces that have 
a look and feel of previous centuries," she writes. Works such as the aluminum 
wire and copper "Undulating Twill" sweep across the wall, catching the sun's 
rays. 
</P>
<P>
 "At different times, with different sun, it really looks different," Finkle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a digital quality to Judy Schuster's finely made, introspective 
portrait tapestries. Finkle said Schuster uses a computer to compose images 
before she begins her tapestries. The faces and hands of the wool on linen "A 
Shadow of My Former Self" exude the complexity and the energy of life. The 
tapestry itself seems almost to move, to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists in the show are: Lyn-Rae Ashley, Diana Brenna, Sherry Jacobson, 
Lois James, Vi Mayfield and Portia Spurney. Where and When 
</P>

COVER STORY; VALS GO HOME; FROM THE BEGINNING, VALLEY SURFERS FOUND A NICHE IN 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SURF LORE -- AS THE BAD GUYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kirk Putnam was a skinny kid from Burbank, sneaking across Topanga Beach with 
his surfboard under one arm, trying to slip unnoticed into the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the local guys spotted you, they'd point you out," Putnam says. "Then the 
guys on the beach would start chucking rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the early 1960s, the early days of the surfing boom. Locals didn't want 
their waves cluttered with San Fernando Valley kooks. Young surfers who flocked 
to the coast from Burbank and Van Nuys and Granada Hills suffered taunts, 
sometimes playful and sometimes worse. They laid low at certain beaches, 
removing license-plate frames and other identifying marks from their cars, 
hoping to escape attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flattening of tires, the breaking of car windows -- it could get 
vicious," says Mark Richards, who grew up in North Hollywood. "If you showed up 
at a surf spot with an attitude, sure, you were asking for trouble. It's just 
that Valley surfers were automatically tagged for having an attitude whether we 
had one or not." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Valley, landlocked, denied even the scent of ocean breezes by 
surrounding mountains, assumed a role in the emerging Southern California surf 
culture. "Valley cowboys" were cast as the bad guys, the marauding hordes. 
</P>
<P>
 This image had little to do with young men such as Putnam and Richards, who 
paddled out against south swells. They counted themselves among a breed drawn 
to the sea, willing to learn a difficult skill, willing to endure the 
interminable waits between good conditions. They never thought of themselves in 
terms of geography. They merely wanted to ride waves. 
</P>
<P>
 But they encountered a larger prejudice, a notion of the Valley as Los 
Angeles' hick cousin. This caricature, the same one that eventually spawned 
"Valley girl" jokes, was made clear to 1960s surfers by the graffiti scrawled 
across the famed Malibu wall: 
</P>
<P>
 "Vals Go Home." 
</P>
<P>
 Each morning in the summer, Steve Krajewski and his buddies would tie their 
surfboards atop the family Corvair and squeeze into the back seat. His 
stepfather, Ron, would drive them west from Canoga Park, through winding canyon 
roads, and drop them off at the beach on his way to work.  
</P>
<P>
 "He'd make a point of telling us to meet him at 5:15," recalls Krajewski, who 
is now 44 years old. "But when he came back, we'd still be in the water. He'd 
start honking his horn. Then he'd drive home at 80 miles an hour and scare the 
hell out of us." 
</P>
<P>
 These were first-generation Valley surfers, the children of a postwar 
migration that had transformed acres of farmland into a vast suburban grid. 
These teen-agers listened to the Ventures. They jeered Frankie-and-Annette 
movies. They caught the same bug that had infected beach kids years before, 
when visiting Hawaiians such as Duke Kahanamoku and George Freeth first surfed 
the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Krajewski and others like him felt the tug of the ocean, most were too 
young to drive. The intricacies of surfing, the necessary strength and balance, 
paled in comparison to a more daunting challenge -- getting to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone had a parent who would offer a ride. Glen Kennedy hitchhiked from 
Canoga Park. Putnam waited at a hamburger stand near his house, careful to hide 
his board from the "hard guys" who cruised by in their hot rods. He waited 
until older surfers came along. 
</P>
<P>
 "The older guys would say to us younger guys, 'All right, I'll take you,' " 
Putnam says. "But we ended up paying for gas and paying for their lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 When beach surfers realized that carloads of awkward newcomers were streaming 
over the hill, the rivalry began. The locals acted as if they could claim some 
ownership to the sea, as if they could trace their blood ancestry back to 
ancient Polynesians who rode heavy wooden planks across the breakers. They 
began painting "Vals Die" on the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beach surfers always felt they had more right to the water because they 
lived closer," Richards says. "Sometimes there were fights in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 More often, the animosity took the form of trash talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw a lot of guys getting vibed," says Michael Marcellino, a Sherman Oaks 
surfer. "There was a lot of talk to psych guys out." 
</P>
<P>
 And there were antics. Legend has it that locals once tried to block the 
canyon roads during a large swell so that Valley surfers could not reach the 
coast. They also waxed car windshields and stole lunches from the younger, 
visiting surfers. Some Vals, in turn, developed a technique called "buttching," 
by which they would sabotage their sandwiches and fruit by rubbing this food 
against various parts of their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu proved a hotbed for such give-and-take. An angry veteran punched dozens 
of dents in a Valley surfer's stray board. Young Vals "buttched" their lunches 
daily. And Putnam made the mistake of cutting off the legendary Mickey Dora. 
</P>
<P>
 "You," Dora muttered. "Out." 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam dutifully paddled to shore and spent the rest of the afternoon watching 
from the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 At beach high schools, surfers enjoyed acceptance in the social scene. On 
campuses such as Cleveland High in Reseda, they were outcasts. They weren't as 
popular as the jocks. They didn't dress as nicely as the soshes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wore Jack Purcell tennies, jeans and madras short-sleeve shirts with our 
hair parted," Chris Faust says. "It was like punk rock is now. It was 
considered sleazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the coast, all the hot surfers had banded together in clubs such as 
Windansea, Bay Cities and the powerhouse Malibu Surfing Assn. Faust and his 
friends began calling themselves the Overhead Surf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fledgling clubs popped up around the Valley. Chatsworth High School had 
the North Coast Surfing Assn. Burbank had the North Swell Surfers. In the 
mid-1960s, a group of younger kids, including Faust's little brother Kingsley, 
formed the Southern Surfing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd all meet at the Canoga Bowling Alley before dawn, 10 or 15 cars full of 
surfers," Kingsley Faust says. The ensuing caravan northward might include a 
stop on the Conejo Grade where surfers would urinate into plastic bags and 
throw them at each other. "We had a few consummate drug addicts who would sniff 
glue all the way. We'd take over a beach and have a blast."  
</P>
<P>
 But clubs offered more than social mayhem. In an era before professional 
contests, they allowed surfers to compete against rivals. Each team had its own 
jacket with a logo. Overhead members strutted the sand in their trademark green 
trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secretary from our club would call the secretary from another club and 
say, 'Let's have a contest.' There was a lot of pride on the line," Chris Faust 
explains. "If you were going up against Windansea, you were going against guys 
like Skip Frye, the magazine heroes of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely did Valley clubs win. But along the way, surfers such as Gary Ross and 
Ron Hoffman earned respect. Krajewski became known as a stylist. The younger 
Kennedy and Angie Reno established themselves as power surfers who could 
manhandle the big waves. 
</P>
<P>
 The coastal clubs took notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley became a farm team," says Doug Williams, an Overhead member who 
garnered a sponsorship from a surfboard manufacturer. "When you got to surf 
good enough, they couldn't wait to pick you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Coleman watched the scene with bemusement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a girl," she says, "I was basically out of the loop." 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't the only female in the water in 1964. Several of her teammates on 
the Taft High School girls' volleyball team surfed, too. But women remained 
something of an oddity in the culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "To even walk into a surf shop was taboo," she says. "It was like a men's club 
or a barbershop or something." 
</P>
<P>
 So Coleman hung out with surfers who avoided the club scene, all the parties 
and the road trips. They shied from the popular spots, hanging out at Sunset 
Beach or at the county line instead, forming surfing's version of a 
counterculture. And by the 1970s, everyone else would rush to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 Surf clubs began to dissipate when the Vietnam War escalated. Many surfers 
were drafted. Others fell into the increasingly prevalent use of drugs. And, as 
the times grew rebellious, no one wanted to wear matching jackets and trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became soul surfers," says Marty Peach, Overhead's last president. "We 
were all part of one tribe." 
</P>
<P>
 For Peach and the rest of Overhead, the end arrived ignominiously. They were 
defeated in a contest against the younger Southern Surfing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ripped my patch off," Peach says. "Then I handed the S.S.A. president the 
rest of our treasury, which wasn't even enough to cover the bet we'd made." 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that followed, surf shops would become the focus for the culture. 
Back in 1962, Richards had persuaded his father to open a shop in North 
Hollywood. As Val Surf & Sport established itself as the grandfather of Valley 
surf shops, the guys who hung around there were known for wearing shag haircuts 
and riding the latest in board designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Ventura Boulevard in Tarzana, Greg Liddle attracted a smaller cadre of 
surfers, the so-called "Liddle League," who swore by the boards he sold. Not 
far away, the Al Beach store catered to West Valley kids. And a few years 
later, Kennedy would open a shop of his own in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene changed considerably in the ensuing years. It was the age of shorter 
boards and acrobatic maneuvers. Some surfers drifted away from the ocean, 
saddened by the end of the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clubs were an ego deal," Williams says. "Those were the most fun times I 
ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Willie Morris figures that being from the Valley helped his 
surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live at the beach, you'll only surf when it's good," the Woodland 
Hills man says. "But if you live in the Valley, to get to the beach, you've got 
to have dedication, you've got to work at it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, guys who drive will surf a lot of different areas," he says. "You go to 
Huntington Beach and surf the beach break. You surf Malibu, where it's a point 
break, and you have to surf it differently. You have to be able to surf a lot 
of conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 This adaptability served Morris well when he joined the professional tour in 
1980. After a string of top results on beaches around the world, he was hailed 
as a top new talent and the Valley's first successful professional surfer.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big deal for me," he says. "I thought about all the guys ahead of 
me. Guys like Krajewski, Kennedy and Marcellino." 
</P>
<P>
 His predecessors had largely defeated the "Valley cowboy" image. Morris, who 
retired from the tour in 1986, carried that hard-earned respect into the glitzy 
contest era. He paved the way for the current generation, surfers such as Joey 
Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
 A North Hollywood native, Jenkins heard none of the old taunts when he began 
surfing in the mid-1980s. He got his first job at Val Surf & Sport. And he had 
a history of Valley surfers to admire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was influenced by guys like Willie Morris," Jenkins says. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Assn. of Surfing Professionals ranked Jenkins as one of the top 
28 surfers in the world. But he seems equally proud of an earlier 
accomplishment when, as an emerging professional, he was sponsored by a coastal 
surf shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Val riding for a Santa Monica company," Jenkins says. "That was pretty much 
the confirmation that I wasn't getting the flak for being a Val." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the way, the term "Val" became synonymous with anyone who 
wasn't part of the established crew at a surf spot. 
</P>
<P>
 But locals don't seem to guard their waves as jealously as they once did. 
"It's nowhere near what it was 20 years ago," Marcellino says. 
</P>
<P>
 At most Southern California beaches, from Santa Barbara down to San Diego, 
geographical distinctions have melted away. The crowds run anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the new breed of Valley surfers, the new kids, they can take a bus that 
carries them -- and their surfboards -- to Zuma Beach each day during the 
summer. And rarely will they see "Vals Die" or Vals Go Home" painted on the 
walls when they get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the swell hits and the waves are good, either you're in the water or 
you're not," Krajewski says. "That's what surfing is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Williams puts it, "If a guy's out there ripping it up, who cares where 
he lives?" 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd way, though, acceptance may have robbed some of the fun from Valley 
surfers. In a sport that has always prided itself on rebellion, they no longer 
have great forces to rally against. 
</P>
<P>
 "The symbol of the Valley surfer," Richards muses. "Maybe we took some pride 
in that."

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: BAGGING A DEAL; WITH LUGGAGE 4 LESS' FOCUS ON QUALITY, 
THE ONLY THING CHEAP ABOUT THE MERCHANDISE IS THE PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If your luggage looks like it might not make it through another airport 
baggage carousel, there's a quick fix at low prices at Luggage 4 Less. 
</P>
<P>
 When I visited this store on a Saturday morning, there was a crowd of 
customers in response to a newspaper ad quoting prices on three sizes of 
rollaways, today's most popular type of luggage. For instance, a 21-inch model 
that would retail for about $160 was advertised at $69.99. These are very well 
made, with two heavy-duty ball-bearing wheels on each side, and are imported 
for Luggage 4 Less. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fred Cohen, the former owner of Weiner's Luggage, assumed ownership of 
Luggage 4 Less in October, 1993, he made some changes, turning the focus from 
low-end brands to more quality pieces, increasing inventory and lowering 
prices. "If our prices aren't less, then we'd have to change our name to 
'Luggage 4 More,' " Cohen said with a wink. 
</P>
<P>
 Many major names in luggage -- Delsey, Lark, Ventura, Boyt, Halliburton, Tumi, 
Samsonite and American Flyer -- are available, all at deep discounts. Missing, 
however, are pricey names such as Hartmann, French and Ghurka. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyt is a high-quality product, and their Mach II 21-inch rollaway is a 
beauty, which sells here for considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
 A sturdy ballistic nylon garment bag for $129 was a buy, since the usual price 
is $220. Less expensive garment bags are available, of course, but this fabric 
is used in bulletproofing and when punctured does not fray. So the bag will 
have a longer life than average nylon ones.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best buys in the store are the attaches and briefcases. These 
all-leather cases would usually sell for $80 to $100, but because these are 
direct imports the price is $39.99. Other direct imports go by the in-house 
brand name of Roma, and these are also excellent deals. There are also a few 
very high-end cases, and they are heavily discounted. A stunning case by Lion 
sells for $400 in most stores but here is $249.99. 
</P>
<P>
 High-fashion soft luggage by Kipling is appealing and colorful. It's priced 
from $23 for a backpack to $99 for a garment bag.  
</P>
<P>
 Cohen's love for luggage carries over into collecting antique trunks and 
suitcases. A handsome trunk made in Virginia in 1868 is on display and priced 
at $595. But there's one piece of luggage in Luggage 4 Less that doesn't have a 
price tag: It's a Hartmann steamer trunk from the 1930s in mint condition. 
Cohen has been offered as much as $3,000 for it, but, there it is, still in the 
window. It's his treasure chest. 
</P>

COLLECTION OF WONDERS; HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 48TH ANNUAL SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FAIR 
INCLUDE HAND-CARVED CAROUSEL HORSES, AN AERIAL STUNT SHOW AND AN EARTHQUAKE 
EXHIBIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Back in 17th-Century Europe, collecting curiosities was fashionable. In 
20th-Century San Fernando Valley, the collecting continues, but now the 
oddities can be found at fairs -- specifically, the 48th annual San Fernando 
Valley Fair, to be held Thursday through July 24 at the Los Angeles Equestrian 
Center in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's crop of "marvels and wonders" as they were termed three centuries 
ago, includes exhibits that feature a giant Monopoly board, hand-carved 
carousel horses, a space craft, horses that appear to glide rather than trot, 
and a man who performs a daring routine perched on a 100-foot pole. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even an earthquake exhibit, although most in the region would say such 
an event was neither marvelous or wondrous. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 700 exhibitors will show their wares at this year's fair, whose 
theme is "We've got your fun covered." 
</P>
<P>
 "All entry fees have been dropped for those who wanted to participate," said 
Georgia Cluver, spokeswoman for the event. "We wanted to open it up to more 
people in the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fair has held horse shows in the past, it hired a professional 
last year to expand the event. Bob Drennan annually presents about 20 horse 
shows. In 1992, he presented the elite Volvo World Cup Jumping Finals in Del 
Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we're showcasing the spectacular," said Drennan, whose free show is 
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sunday. "Our biggest draw will be the Tennessee 
Plantation Walking horse, the smoothest-gaited horse, ever. They don't trot, 
but do a flat walk that's more of a glide." 
</P>
<P>
 The horse show includes 50 other events in the air-cooled Equidome on the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 4-H, Future Farmers of America and other groups will compete in 
the halter, English, Western and trail horse divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other animal-related presentations include pig races, a junior livestock 
auction, at 9:30 a.m. Saturday, a petting zoo, a sheepherding show at 1 p.m., 4 
p.m. and 7 p.m. Thursday and the Bull-O-Rama bull-riding event at 8 p.m. Friday 
and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Creations built by Valley youths also are a large part of this year's fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year the Patrick Henry Middle School in Granada Hills presents 
"Math-O-Rama," an event designed to quicken children's interest in mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest challenges students to build models twice to 10 times the normal 
size of everyday items. This year, large-scale replicas of a box of doughnuts, 
silverware, a calculator and a Monopoly board will be on display. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a Nestle's Crunch bar, and we did have a giant Hershey's bar, but it 
didn't make it through the earthquake," said Sheila Berman, the school's math 
chair. "One year we had a young man replicate himself out of strips of sheet 
metal." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's creations can be found in the Youth Education Pavilion, which 
also features a craftsman who restores and builds carousel horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jess Zavala, who has worked on his craft for 10 years in Piru, will carve 
miniature and full-scale horses at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The pavilion also contains the fair's earthquake exhibit, with a facade that 
incorporates a fault line and an interior that harbors photos and a video of 
news coverage of the Jan. 17 catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaled-down models of Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Lab projects will lend a 
futuristic tone to the pavilion, Cluver said. 
</P>
<P>
 A model of the space probe Galileo, which is in position to observe comet 
Shoemaker-Levy's crash into Jupiter soon, will be on display. Models of imaging 
radar equipment used in shuttle missions and the wide-field planetary camera 
used to correct vision problems in the Hubble Space Telescope also can be 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair's grandest aerial feature, however, will be Sway Pole Man, featuring 
aerialist Bruce Anderson, whose routine several times a day begins on a 
stationary trapeze welded to a 70-foot pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson then climbs to a higher pedestal, where he performs a Marine sword 
and drill act. For a finale, Anderson inches up to the 100-foot mark to perform 
a headstand on his pole, which sways precariously. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair's free entertainment kicks off with The Tokens, who are known for 
their 1960s songs, "The Lion Sleeps Tonight," and "Tonight I Fell in Love." 
They'll perform at 8 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other free entertainment includes the Richard Allen Swing Band and other 
bands, marionettes, magicians, juggling and comedy acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial exhibits (offering for sale "the slicer dicers, gift items and 
stuff like that," said Cluver) will be on view, as well as carnival rides, food 
booths and exhibits on home arts and crafts, fine arts, photography and 
gardening. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: The 48th annual San Fernando Valley Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Los Angeles Equestrian Center, 480 Riverside Drive, Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Noon to 10:30 p.m. Thursday and July 22, 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. July 23 
and 24.  
</P>
<P>
 Price: $5 general; free for ages 11 and younger. On Thursday, those 55 and 
older and 15 and younger are admitted free until 6 p.m. Parking on the grounds 
is $3. There is also a free bus that shuttles fair-goers in from satellite 
parking lots. 
</P>

POOLING TOGETHER FOR A GOOD TIME

 Without so much as a star-studded benefit or a single revving Harley, the 
trendy Hollywood Athletic Club opened a San Fernando Valley branch at CityWalk 
in May. The original hall, located in a storied building of Italianate 
architecture, attracts the stars and is often packed. But the new club, tucked 
off an upstairs balcony, is new enough that players don't have to wait for 
hours to get a table. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: A sparkling bar, a restaurant and tasteful decor. There are tables 
upstairs and down. Greg Park stopped by recently with a friend after their 
class at the nearby UCLA Extension. "We usually play at Yankee Doodle's or 
Gotham City on the Third Street Promenade," said Park, 27, of Hacienda Heights. 
"This is different. The crowd is a little older. It's less loud." 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: "Over in Hollywood, it's the movie actor scene," said April Dion, a 
club waitress. "Here, we get a lot of the Burbank studio people." Indeed, the 
clientele sports more than a few coats and ties. A few pink-skinned tourists 
are likely to be huddled near the bar. There is an acceptable scattering of the 
young and denim, as well. But it's a different story when the girl with the 
pierced eyebrow and her friends walk in. "The people are looking at us like 
we're riffraff," said Trixie DeLeon, 19, of Van Nuys. "This place is a bit 
high-class, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: The house stereo plays everything from alternative to classic rock. 
John Lienhardt, the club's general manager, says that a schedule of live 
performances will begin within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: Pools halls are like the proverbial glass of water. You can look at 
them as half-full or half-empty. Sure, the new places lack a degree of 
character. But the cues run straight and the felts are bright and clean. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: A cheap date this ain't. The tables run $15 an hour in the evening. 
Cocktails cost $4 and more. There is even a tip jar for the guy who hands out 
the pool balls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE UGLY: Avoid the fried calamari. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Athletic Club is located on the second floor of the center court 
at CityWalk in Universal City. Hours are 11:30 to 2 a.m. every day. Tables cost 
$8 an hour until 7 p.m., $15 an hour until closing. Casual attire is 
acceptable. Minors accompanied by an adult are allowed in the pool room until 9 
p.m. (818) 505-9238. DAVID WHARTON

3-HOUR TOUR: ON THE DESERT HIGHWAY; A DRIVE ALONG THE PEARBLOSSOM OFFERS A 
SLICE OF QUAINT COUNTRY LIFE, INCLUDING CAFES, PRODUCE STANDS, NOVELTY SHOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Artist David Hockney immortalized the Antelope Valley's Pearblossom Highway in 
a 1986 photographic collage, a somewhat surreal fragmentation of road, road 
signs, trash and the desert landscape of Joshua trees that seem to define the 
remote desolation of this area. 
</P>
<P>
 As you head north on the Antelope Valley Freeway from Santa Clarita, the 
change in landscape and mood begins to match Hockney's work. It feels a bit 
like time traveling -- the land is open and mostly undeveloped. A mix of 
rolling hills covered with grasses, rougher areas with jutting rock formations, 
and flatter desert landscapes covered with scrubby flora surround the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who travel Pearblossom Highway are most likely using the road as a means 
to elsewhere -- hiking at Devil's Punchbowl, skiing at Mountain High in 
Wrightwood or journeying to Las Vegas. To many travelers, dodging tumbleweeds 
may be the most exciting driving here. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who take the time to pull off the highway and take notice of the 
tiny towns of Littlerock and Pearblossom will find a strip of country desert 
culture, including quaint, cracker-box cafes, produce stands, novelty shops and 
antique stores. 
</P>
<P>
 For this tour, hit the shops on the right side of Pearblossom Highway as you 
travel east, turn around in Pearblossom and visit shops on the other side as 
you head back. 
</P>
<P>
 10 a.m.: Driving along Pearblossom Highway toward Littlerock, you will 
immediately notice DeZert BiZarre on the right. A bright yellow building touts 
"Gifts for Loving. Gifts for Touching." Animal knickknacks and toys in every 
stuffed, ceramic and carved version imaginable fill the place. The store has 
several rooms occupied with curious curios, including "nut and bolt people." 
Country items seem to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
 DeZert BiZarre, 7178 Pearblossom Highway, is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Mondays through Saturdays and noon to 5 p.m. Sundays. (805) 944-3233.  
</P>
<P>
 10:30 a.m.: Fruit stands and country markets are bountiful in Littlerock. 
Farmer's Mart features local produce, local honey, homemade pies and other 
baked goods. Up the road is H-R Ranch, an outdoor produce stand that features 
peaches, one of the area's big crops. 
</P>
<P>
 10:45 a.m.: You reach the tiny town of Pearblossom (four miles from 
Littlerock), named for the pear orchards that were once bountiful but were 
eventually wiped out by blight. Bobbie's Nursery & Grocery is on a small lot 
with two buildings, one containing gardening equipment and supplies, the other 
a little produce stand. In the back is a small greenhouse and rows of desert 
landscape plants, flowering shrubs and aloe vera sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up the road is a small store, looking more like a cabin, called the 
Bottle Shop Market, which sells everything from moccasins to homemade popcorn 
balls to Cajun gumbo mixes -- but no bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m.: The scent of smoldering sage permeates the Country & Indian Store. 
Owner Mary Rodgers says she burns sage to bless the place. Rodgers said Native 
American enthusiasts from all over the country visit, looking for authentic art 
and craft items. Bruce Springsteen even patronized the store once, purchasing a 
buffalo head and strapping it onto his motorcycle, she said. Rodgers carries a 
wide range of items, from incense ($2.50), smudging sticks ($5.50) and healing 
stones ($3) to such higher-priced Native American art as wooden cradle boards 
($80), ceremonial pipes ($35 to $145) and hand-woven rugs ($200 to $400). 
</P>
<P>
 The Country & Indian Store, 12822 Pearblossom Highway, is open from 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sundays. (805) 944-5449. 
 
</P>
<P>
 11:30 a.m.: Make a loop on Pearblossom Highway and head back. On the right 
(formerly the left) is a wooden building called the Orbit Antiques in 
Littlerock. Inside is a dusty chaos of disorganized antiques, from old 
typewriters to refrigerators to books. Next door is Handcrafts, specializing in 
handmade quilts, from small baby quilts ($50) to large quilts (94 inches by 94 
inches for $185). Quilted animals and dolls ($5 to $10) and hand-painted wood 
knickknacks ($4 to $10) are also sold. 
</P>
<P>
 11:45 a.m.: Charlie Brown Farms, painted barn red, in Littlerock is probably 
the most versatile of the stores in the Littlerock/Pearblossom region. The 
business features four buildings and encompasses a snack bar that serves more 
than 100 types of shakes (about $1.83 each with tax), including date shakes, 
praline shakes and Dutch apple pie shakes; a selection of local produce and 
homemade candies, including chocolate-covered grapefruit strips; a shop full of 
local honey, including flavors of avocado and coffee; a section of toys and 
gifts, including dollhouse furniture; an outdoor patio of pottery and ceramics; 
a pottery barn that features a perpetual Christmas shop; a shop devoted 
entirely to ceramics for the bathroom, and a building called Serenity & 
Bookshop with pamphlets, books and gifts focusing on recovery themes, such as 
co-dependency, alcoholism and other addictions. 
</P>

 You are, after all, in the country. Where to Go 
</P>
<P>

U. S. OUTLINES NEW QUAKE-AID PLAN FOR FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quake-damaged businesses -- even those that have been denied loans by the 
Small Business Administration -- may be eligible to receive money and help with 
their debts under a $30-million federal program outlined Thursday by Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funds will fill a financial void created by the Northridge earthquake," 
Brown said. "Small businesses will be able to access the necessary capital that 
is at the center of their recovery and expansion plans."  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to a group of about 60 representatives of nonprofit organizations, 
lenders and community leaders, Brown presented the Competitive Communities 
Across America program, which he described as a non-traditional approach to 
assisting communities that redefines the role of the federal government in 
propelling local economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be creative and dynamic in our approach," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program, which will eventually be implemented in other cities, 
relies on the knowledge and skills of nonprofit community-based organizations, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, the Commerce Department's Economic Development 
Administration will select nonprofit organizations or "intermediaries," which 
will receive federal grants to establish revolving loan funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the specific needs and goals of their communities, the intermediaries 
will provide loans to selected businesses and help them restructure debts. The 
intermediaries will specifically try to help businesses that have the potential 
for growth and to create employment opportunities, but may be deeply in debt, 
including businesses that sought but were denied SBA quake assistance, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these companies have fallen between the cracks," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will also bring together public, private and nonprofit 
organizations to set priorities and strategies for their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very results-oriented approach that is very measurable and 
monitorable," Brown said. "It is . . . a new approach that acknowledges that 
sustained economic growth is not going to take place without the private 
sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Although businesses affected by the quake will benefit from the program, 
others will be eligible to apply as well, said Carol L. Hamilton, Brown's press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending the meeting included San Fernando Valley business leaders and 
executives of nonprofit groups as well as representatives of First A.M.E. 
Church, the Brotherhood Crusade, and other businesses and organizations from 
throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Many welcomed the secretary's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a loan fund of last resort for a lot of businesses," said John J. 
Rooney, president of the Valley Economic Development Center Inc. "If a business 
has been rejected because of pre-existing debt, this is going to be an extra 
source of capital for them to go back to the SBA with and reapply." 
</P>
<P>
 David C. Lizarraga, president of Telacu, a community development firm, said 
the value of the program lies in its ability to help businesses create more 
jobs and attract more capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The importance of the $30 million isn't the $30 million itself, it's what it 
can leverage," Lizarraga said. "The success of the program will be in our 
ability to get it to the employer." 
</P>
<P>
 C. David Henry, of the Dunbar Economic Development Corp., said he is concerned 
with finding ways to attract high-tech businesses and jobs to the inner city. 
Some businesses, he said, are willing to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is we need to be able to finance deals to get them 
back into the inner city," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for nonprofit organizations to apply for the program is July 31 
and the selections will be made in August, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Economic Development Administration will hold community forums to 
introduce the programs to interested organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The launch of the Southern California program is part of a larger effort by 
the Commerce Department to promote competitive businesses in "economically 
distressed areas," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the rising economic tide doesn't lift all boats, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that as opportunity expands, everybody benefits," he 
said. "There are a lot of folks out there that don't have any boats."

COUNSELING TOUGHENED FOR SPOUSE ABUSE CASES; CORRECTIONS: UNDER NEW RULES SET 
OUT BY A COUNTY AGENCY, CONVICTED BATTERERS MUST ATTEND 32 GROUP SESSIONS IN A 
36-WEEK PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County is tightening its standards for domestic violence counseling so 
men convicted of beating their wives cannot avoid jail by simply calling a 
psychologist or attending an occasional therapy session. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the mandates of a new state law, the county Corrections Services 
Agency has set out strict standards for nonprofit groups that counsel abusers 
who seek therapy in order to avoid a jail term. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, convicted batterers must attend 32 group sessions in a 
36-week period. The programs must focus on the abusers' responsibility for 
their actions, not on substance abuse or family counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 And counselors must file paperwork to keep probation officers informed if 
abusers skip too many sessions. Probation officers, in turn, must keep victims 
and any current partner informed of the progress of the program and report any 
further violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an attempt to give some kind of structure to the services that are 
provided," said Karen Staples, court services division manager for the county 
corrections agency. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, California law has allowed judges to divert abusers into counseling 
programs rather than jail. But judges had discretion over the duration and type 
of treatment the batterers received. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have absolutely been times when the system has been manipulated by 
people with money and a good attorney," said Jamie Leigh, executive director of 
the Ventura County Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 When football star O.J. Simpson was convicted of abusing his wife, Nicole, in 
1989, his treatment began with actual therapy sessions but ended with phone 
calls to a counselor. The judge in that case, Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge 
Ronald R. Schoenberg, has come under criticism now that Simpson stands accused 
of the murders of Nicole Simpson and a friend last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In a local case, Moorpark resident James Linkenauger attended court-ordered 
counseling in 1990, but continued abusing his wife, Joanne, throughout the 
program, according to court records. He was convicted of murdering her in a 
violent episode 2 1/2 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old rules, some abusers attended five sessions on anger control, 
while others remained in therapy for the better part of a year. Some simply 
went to alcohol or drug abuse programs. Others went into family counseling with 
the spouses or children they abused. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, they had two years to complete the programs and little monitoring 
of how often they attended sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines, which took effect July 1, should prevent the mishmash of 
approaches to the domestic violence problem, Leigh said. They will also 
condense the counseling into a nine-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the guidelines, agencies that want to provide counseling must apply to 
the county corrections office with a detailed plan for counseling and staffing. 
Four agencies have applied in Ventura County and are awaiting approval. Among 
them are Leigh's organization and Interface Children Family Services of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The county currently has about 500 abusers diverted from jail to therapy. And 
probation officers prepare reports for the Municipal Court on about 45 cases 
each month, according to the corrections agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether Ventura County handled about 4,000 domestic disturbance calls last 
year. Of those, 800 misdemeanor and 30 felony cases went to court. 
</P>
<P>
 The diversion program is designed for offenders in less serious cases, people 
who seem likely to benefit more from counseling than punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking to punish someone, yeah, send them to jail," said Staples 
of the Corrections Services Agency. "But going to jail isn't going to help them 
change their behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Batterers need to learn to deal with anger and frustration without striking 
out, she said. But even after therapy some abusers return to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there are those kind of cases," she said. "I hate to say this, 
even setting standards and guidelines is no guarantee that the batterers won't 
go back to their previous behavior."

WHEELER SPA FACES INQUIRY OVER DUMPING INTO CREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly a month of fighting off bacteria in its hot tubs, Wheeler Hot 
Springs has purged the contamination, but the tubs remained closed Thursday as 
the resort grappled with a new problem: an investigation of possible illegal 
waste dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 After discovering this week that pipes from some of Wheeler's tubs feed into 
the north fork of Matilija Creek, officials from the Ventura County 
Environmental Health Division ordered the tubs to remain off-limits to the 
public until the resort completes a project to route its pipes into a septic 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the state Department of Fish and Game has launched an investigation 
to determine whether discharged chlorine or some other form of waste from the 
pipes contributed to a fish kill in Matilija Creek reported on July 1, said Lt. 
Chris Long, superintendent for the department's Ventura County bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said he did not know how many fish died. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Marshall, general manager of Wheeler Hot Springs, could not be reached for 
comment Thursday, but said earlier this week he is not sure when the rustic 
spas will reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials first ordered the historic resort north of Ojai to close its 
hot tubs June 22, after tests showed that some of them had a bacteria count 
more than 30 times higher than allowed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 To kill the bacteria, resort officials began pouring as much as 100 times the 
normal amount of chlorine into the tubs. After six rounds of tests, county 
officials said this week that the bacteria count had been lowered to an 
acceptable range. 
</P>
<P>
 An inspection by county and state officials Tuesday, however, revealed that 
the hot tubs were not discharging into septic tanks, as county officials had 
been told by the resort, but were emptying into a nearby stream, said Robert 
Williamson, a county environmental health manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Marshall had informed us that the waste from the hot tubs was discharging 
to a septic tank," Williamson said Thursday. "Our investigation disclosed this 
was not correct." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials informed Marshall Tuesday that the pipes had to be rerouted 
before the tubs could reopen, Williamson said. But Thursday, inspectors found 
that the project was not complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of that, we're requiring (that) his facility remain closed," 
Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said the resort is cooperating through efforts to change the piping 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall has indicated "that his contractor is going to continue to try to get 
the plumbing installed," Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said he warned resort officials Tuesday that any discharging of chlorine 
or other harmful waste into the creek is a violation of the state Fish and Game 
code. 
</P>
<P>
 He said investigators are trying to determine if Wheeler has already violated 
the law, perhaps as a result of the efforts to kill bacteria in the tubs with 
chlorine treatment in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough evidence is gathered, the case would be turned over to the district 
attorney's office for possible prosecution, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler's problems began last month after a bather who had used one of the hot 
tubs reported suffering a leg infection, county health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first test of the tubs showed levels of bacteria ranging from "less than 1 
to greater than 6,500" colonies per milliliter of water, officials said. The 
acceptable level is 200 bacterial colonies per milliliter. 
</P>
<P>
 The tubs reopened for one weekend in June after preliminary results from one 
of the tests showed the high bacteria levels had subsided. Bathers who used the 
hot tubs that weekend were "likely safe," a county official said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the tubs were shut down again after conclusive results showed 
continued high bacteria levels. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials have not identified the type or source of the bacteria 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state regulations, officials only need to test for the amount of 
bacteria, not the type, state and county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing in the statute that requires the county to identify the type 
of bacteria routinely," said Nadine Feletto, a senior sanitary engineer with 
the state Department of Health Services. "But if there was a disease outbreak 
they would be looking for a causative agent -- a type of bacteria or another 
disease-causing agent." 
</P>
<P>
 During an inspection last month, Wheeler employees found the remains of the 
body of a small animal that apparently had burrowed into the water line, 
Marshall said in a recent interview. But he said he did not know if that was 
the source of the bacterial problem.

A 'TEMPORARY' JOB THAT PAID THE BILLS; VENTURA: GENE R. HOWARD STARTED OUT AS 
LETTER CARRIER 34 YEARS AGO TO HELP PAY FOR COLLEGE. NOW HE HAS TOP SPOT IN 
HUGE PACIFIC REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Gene R. Howard got a job delivering mail for the post office more than 
three decades ago, it was supposed to be a temporary position to help pay 
college bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But today -- 34 years later -- the Ventura man is still an employee of the 
vast network that delivers the nation's mail. And he was recently named area 
vice president for the U.S. Postal Service's Pacific area, a gigantic postal 
region that includes all of California and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only nine other people in the country with a similar position, said 
Postal Service spokesman David Mazer. And with his promotion, Howard is just 
two steps away from the nation's top postal job -- postmaster general, Mazer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's thought of as a doer," Mazer said. "He's not a yes-man kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Iniguez, who worked with Howard in his prior job as manager of the post 
office's giant Van Nuys processing plant, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an outspoken individual," Iniguez said. "If he thinks there is something 
wrong in the corporation, he speaks up." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, 52, never intended to become a postal employee. 
</P>
<P>
 But while studying industrial engineering at Cal State San Jose, he began 
working part-time as a letter carrier. Upon graduation in 1964, Howard briefly 
left the postal service to work in aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to the postal service as an engineer in the early 1970s, when work 
in aerospace engineering began to decline. He then began a quick climb up the 
management ranks. Howard modestly says he's still not sure how he got to the 
top in the postal service. His first job as a letter carrier paid $1.80 an 
hour; with his new title, he earns an annual salary of $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still pinching myself," Howard said. "I never expected to have this job." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he was in Washington, D.C., meeting with Postmaster General 
Marvin T. Runyon Jr. and chief operating officer William Henderson to discuss 
what his new job will entail. 
</P>
<P>
 He was selected for the post by Runyon and Henderson -- his only superiors in 
the service -- as part of an overall plan to improve efficiency in the agency, 
Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 As vice president of the Pacific area, he is in charge of customer relations, 
mail delivery and administration at 39 major postal centers and 1,154 post 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 About 103,000 employees are under his supervision, and he must make sure that 
60 million pieces of mail reach their proper destination each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard allows that his new job is a "major challenge." Beside dealing with 
employees in high-stress jobs, he also must help position the postal service to 
compete with a plethora of new services and technologies that threaten to cut 
into the service's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard will be a key figure in how the postal service responds to the changing 
marketplace, where increasingly competitive offerings range from private 
express-mail companies to information accessed via computer. 
</P>
<P>
 To relieve his own stress, Howard turns to the sea. He and his wife, Judy, 
have lived near the ocean for the past 17 years, first in Santa Barbara and 
since last year, in Ventura, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a 32-foot cutter, the Sunseeker, that he takes out to the Channel 
Islands whenever he gets the chance, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimates he has made about 400 trips to the islands just off Ventura 
County's coast in the past 20 years. His new job will require him to move to a 
suburb of San Francisco, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to be the toughest part of taking this job," he said. "I love 
the tri-county area. This is probably where we will settle down when I retire."

RETIRED STATE JURIST AGREES TO HEAR SUIT OVER LANDFILL; ENVIRONMENT: RICHARD 
ABBE WILL OVERSEE MOVE TO KEEP WELDON CANYON INITIATIVE OFF BALLOT. TWO JUDGES 
HAVE RECUSED THEMSELVES FROM CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A lawsuit that seeks to keep the Weldon Canyon landfill initiative off the 
November ballot will be heard by a retired out-of-county jurist after two 
Ventura County judges excused themselves from hearing the highly sensitive 
case, and another was disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, it's a shame because it sounds like an interesting case," said 
William Peck, a Ventura resident who opposes the project and is one of the two 
Superior Court judges who recused themselves from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Barbara A. Lane, a Ventura resident, also recused herself from the case, 
while proponents of the ballot initiative disqualified one of her colleagues -- 
Superior Court Judge John J. Hunter, an Ojai resident. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the controversial lawsuit bounced out of three courtrooms, 
Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. Johnson finally called Richard W. 
Abbe, a Santa Barbara resident and a retired justice from the Ventura-based 2nd 
District Court of Appeal. Abbe agreed to hear the matter, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to give voters a say on 
the controversial proposed landfill, prompting Ojai and Ventura city officials 
to file a suit against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action, which places the landfill initiative on the November 
ballot, sets up a potentially divisive campaign that could pit east county 
communities against their west county neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would grant certain zoning and land-use powers to a San Diego 
County partnership that drafted the ballot initiative. That partnership, 
Taconic Resources, filed the affidavit of prejudice that disqualified Hunter 
from the case, a lawyer opposing the issue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe's appointment to the case -- as well as the removal of three local judges 
-- shows how widespread the Weldon Canyon landfill controversy has become, some 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, in a relatively small county . . . I sit on cases sometimes where I 
know parties on both sides," Peck said. "The question isn't that. The question 
is whether I can rule objectively on the facts and evidence. And in this case I 
feel entirely uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Lane declined to say why she recused herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Judge Johnson said it was her impression that Lane's mother has been 
involved somehow in the opposition to the ballot initiative. Johnson also said 
Peck's wife has had similar involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck said his wife has attended meetings sponsored by opponents of the 
initiative. As a judge, he is not allowed to participate in such political 
activity and has not done so, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The judge who was disqualified from the case, Hunter, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney who works with those opposing the landfill proposal said she is 
satisfied with Judge Abbe handling the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to get a hearing early before a judge," said lawyer Katherine 
Stone. "We're not going around judge shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 The objective of the coalition against the proposed landfill is to have the 
measure declared illegal before county ballots are printed for the Nov. 8 
election.

 She agreed with Peck that whatever the outcome in the local courts, the 
decision will be appealed to higher courts. "This is the kind of case that 
could make some interesting law," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic lawyers familiar with the lawsuit could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said it is unusual for the local courts to go outside the county for a 
judge. But she said it happens occasionally when a local lawyer who knows many 
of the judges is involved in a divorce or other personal legal dispute.

 Justice Abbe announced his retirement from the 2nd District Court of Appeal in 
1990, ending an eight-year tenure distinguished by rulings that clarified

MAN SUSPECTED OF BEATING WIFE WHO THEN MISCARRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Paula man is being held on suspicion of murder after police said 
Thursday he had beaten his pregnant wife, who then suffered a miscarriage and 
lost the unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors reviewing the case are expected to decide today whether to charge 
Manuel Magana Magana, 52, with murder because the fetus was more than 3 months 
old when it died Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the district attorney's opinion, through a recent Supreme Court 
decision, that anything beyond six or eight weeks is considered a homicide," 
said Santa Paula Police Sgt. Gary Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical authorities are not certain that the miscarriage was a direct result 
of the mother's injuries. Prosecutors have called in county medical experts to 
review the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Magana is in custody at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of murder 
and spousal battery in lieu of $250,000 bail. He is scheduled to be arraigned 
this afternoon in Ventura County Municipal Court, a jail official said. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, 43-year-old Delia Magana, had numerous bruises across her body when 
she arrived at Santa Paula Hospital on Wednesday night, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A mother of seven who works at Egg City, Delia Magana has told police and 
hospital officials that her injuries resulted from a work-related accident. But 
investigators do not believe that explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already been up there (to Egg City) and there's no way these injuries 
could be a result of her job function," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials alerted police because the woman had been treated 
previously for injuries that doctors and nurses suspected were the result of 
domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the hospital staff, this is a continuing pattern of abuse over a 
period of time that she's grown accustomed to," Marshall said. "But she told us 
he only grabbed her." 
</P>
<P>
 Magana became upset with his wife sometime before dinner Wednesday, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently (the argument) had something to do with cooking eggs," Marshall 
said. "He wanted her to cook him some eggs and I guess she didn't jump quick 
enough. That's what it boils down to." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members contacted Thursday said the woman has returned home and is 
feeling fine. Pascual Magana, her adult son, said the miscarriage was unrelated 
to any beating his mother may have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did not lose the baby because of that," Pascual Magana said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Magana has no criminal convictions, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials first told police that Delia Magana miscarried because of 
the injuries inflicted by her husband. But Marshall said a supervising 
physician told him Thursday that he suspected the miscarriage might not have 
been a direct result of a beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still pursuing it with other medical experts to see what their opinion 
is," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and district attorney's investigators spent much of Thursday 
afternoon talking with experts from the coroner's office and the Ventura County 
Medical Center to get second and third opinions on the cause of the 
miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll review reports from Santa Paula police (Friday) morning, and then make 
a decision on what charges to file," said Ronald C. Janes, who supervises the 
major crimes division of the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 If prosecutors decide not to file a murder charge, Marshall said, Magana is 
likely to be charged with felony spousal abuse.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLANNERS SUPPORT 3 LOW-PROFILE PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ignoring some of the flashiest projects before them, including a controversial 
land swap proposed by developer Ron Hertel, Ventura's Planning Commission has 
recommended that three small, low-profile projects receive the city's coveted 
annual housing allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners supported this week three projects that would add a 
total of 176 dwellings to the city, slightly more than the 165 city planners 
recommended for the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the units would be single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very good about what the commission did," Chairwoman Ingrid Elsel 
said. "If you notice, all the projects we approved are small and fill in space 
between existing developments." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners recommended approving 36 condominiums near the intersection of 
Cedar and Kellogg streets, 80 mobile homes northwest of Copland Drive at 
Telephone Road and 60 apartment units at the corner of Darling Road and Saticoy 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations will go to the City Council, which is expected to make a 
final decision July 25. Several major projects will also go to the council at 
the same time, but without Planning Commission support. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those, Hertel's 437-home proposal for the east side may be the most 
controversial. He would give the city $2 million and land at Kimball and 
Telephone roads for a regional park in exchange for permission to build his 
subdivision on a city-owned lemon orchard at Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members, reflecting the community overall, are divided over the 
proposal. But commissioners rejected it as too large and not a good enough deal 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A 330-home project on Ventura Avenue, proposed by the Neel and Huntsinger 
families and Kinko's Service Corp., is supported by most council members. They 
say it will breathe new life into the aging Avenue area. Many commissioners, 
however, said they did not like the project's design. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY, MOORPARK; TARDINESS PLAGUES METROLINK SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metrolink service to Ventura County is the tardiest in the rail carrier's 
five-county system, with trains to and from Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo 
and Oxnard late nearly one-fourth of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report released by Metrolink, Ventura County trains in June 
were more than five minutes late nearly 25% of the time.During the same month, 
trains to and from San Bernardino, Orange, Riverside and Los Angeles counties 
were late for 8% to 21% of all trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains' lateness is caused by a number of factors, including antiquated 
switching signals, freight traffic and long stretches of single-track railways, 
said Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riders value on-time service more than anything else," Hidalgo said. "We are 
working to make these trips run in a more timely fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 To help improve service, Metrolink has launched a two-year project to replace 
the old switching signals with a state-of-the art system. Metrolink has also 
fined Southern Pacific railroad $3,000 for causing freight delays along the 
Ventura County Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts seem to be paying off.  
</P>
<P>
 From July 5 to 8, all trains to and from Ventura County ran on time, Hidalgo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge is to make sure we keep the trains running on time," Hidalgo 
said. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHULTZE DROPS OUT OF CITY COUNCIL RACE

<P>
 Simi Valley park district director Debi Schultze has dropped out of the race 
for City Council, four months after she became the first candidate to announce 
her bid for the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultze said she decided to abandon her plans to run in order to spend more 
time with her three sons, ages 9, 13 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your kids are only there for so long and I need to be able to give them the 
attention they need," Schultze said. "It just so happens they all need it at 
the same time right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Schultze, 37, works as a loan processor at Aspen Mortgage and serves on the 
board of the Rancho Simi Park and Recreation District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one of those things where I thought the timing was right but then 
it turned out to be wrong," Schultze said. "Politics will just have to wait." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council seats held by Sandi Webb and Judy Mikels are up for election 
in November. Webb said she plans to formally announce her reelection bid today. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other Simi Valley residents have announced plans to run for City Council 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Dean F. Kunicki, 49, an insurance consultant and Simi Valley planning 
commissioner; Michael S. Mc Caffrey, an insurance underwriter and former 
president of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce; Lindsey Paul Miller, 55, 
former Simi Valley police chief, and Joseph R. Vesalga, 39, a computer operator 
and Neighborhood Council director. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CONSERVATION AGENCY OKS NONPROFIT BID

<P>
 Trying to bolster its ability to raise money, the Conejo Open Space 
Conservation Agency has voted to move toward creating a nonprofit foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all agreed that having a nonprofit foundation will help in fund raising," 
board member Rorie Skei said."People seem more willing to make donations to 
nonprofits, and we'll have much greater flexibility in grant applications." 
</P>
<P>
 The board on Wednesday night voted 5 to 0, authorizing staff to draft the 
necessary documents to form a nonprofit foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 As planned, the foundation would pay for the upkeep on the 14,000 acres of 
land owned by COSCA, a joint powers agency between the city of Thousand Oaks 
and the Conejo Valley Recreation and Park District. In addition, funds would be 
used for educational purposes and future land purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that the fabulous treasure the people have in the Conejo 
Valley lasts into the next century and beyond into perpetuity," Skei said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other business, the COSCA board endorsed the Thousand Oaks City Council's 
planned Environmental Impact Report on relocating the Two Winds Ranch 
equestrian center to Broome Ranch.  
</P>
<P>
 Members also approved landscaping of a 1,700-square-foot piece of property 
across from Avenida Amelgado, in the McCrea Wildlife Preserve. MARY F. POLS

$22.1-MILLION BUDGET CUTS 4 CITY POSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fillmore city officials have cut four jobs from the payroll in approving a 
$22.1-million spending plan for this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1994-95 city budget, the positions of assistant city manager, 
recreation coordinator, public works secretary and a code enforcement officer 
all were eliminated, City Manager Roy Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three of these positions are being cut because the individuals in those 
positions are planning on taking early retirement," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city's only code enforcement officer will be laid off and the 
city will contract with a private firm to perform those services, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city now employs 25 people, down from its high three years ago of 32 
employees. Despite this year's cutbacks, Payne said the budget was not as tough 
as those in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far this year, we've not been impacted by any take-away schemes on the 
part of state government or county government, which we've had to deal with the 
last couple of years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget approved Tuesday night calls for nearly $6 million in 
earthquake-recovery projects, including grants and loans for repairs to homes 
and businesses lost in the Jan. 17 temblor, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore will spend almost $5 million more than it expects in revenues over 
the fiscal year. But Payne said there was a $12.8-million ending balance from 
last year that will drop to about $8 million by next June. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; POSTERS RIP BACKERS OF HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newbury Park residents blanketed their neighborhood early Thursday with 
posters, saying "Dump the three development stooges," and other messages 
targeting the three Thousand Oaks City Council members who voted for the first 
phase of a massive housing project on the Dos Vientos Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, Residents to Preserve Newbury Park, placed dozens of colorful 
placards along neighborhood thoroughfares, protesting Mayor Alex Fiore's and 
council members Judy Lazar and Frank Schillo's support for the first 220 houses 
in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to "Dump the three development stooges," the signs carried such 
messages as "Dos Vientos: Another gift to Newbury Park from Judy Lazar," and 
"Dos Vientos: Remember in November," a reference to upcoming city and county 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Koetke, who helped coordinate the protest campaign, said residents 
are mostly concerned about the increased traffic and pollution that the Dos 
Vientos project will bring to their neighborhood. The development could 
eventually include 2,350 houses in the foothills off Potrero Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community has really come together on this," Koetke said. "We're not 
going to give up. This is not over." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said the protest was politically motivated and not representative of 
most Newbury Park residents. The councilman is in a race for county supervisor 
with attorney Trudi Loh, who is running as an environmentalist opposing the Dos 
Vientos project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a small group of people who are trying to gain more ground 
politically," said Schillo. He helped negotiate a 1987 agreement with the two 
Dos Vientos developers that guarantees them the right to build 2,350 homes in 
exchange for $12.6 million in fees for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city were to violate that agreement, Schillo said, it would open itself 
up to lawsuits. To address some residents' concerns, however, he has suggested 
forming two citizens committees to monitor the development and to come up with 
recommendations on how to spend the developer fees generated by the project.

COUNCIL OKS PLANS FOR 238 NEW HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three development companies have been given the go-ahead to build more than 
230 new homes in separate areas of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Wednesday night approved a Spanish Hills Development Co. 
proposal to construct 89 single-family houses on a 51-acre parcel at Ponderosa 
and Earl Joseph drives. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses are proposed to be considerably smaller than other homes offered at 
the nearby Spanish Hills Golf and Country Club development. Houses in the new 
tract will not exceed 2,540 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved a proposal by Pardee Construction Co. to build 58 
single-family houses on a 15-acre parcel at Adolfo Road and Mission Oaks 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In both developments, the council agreed to change the parcel's zoning from 
rural exclusive to residential planned development, allowing more dense 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I voted in favor of these developments because I think they work 
with the surrounding communities," said Councilwoman Charlotte Craven. 
</P>
<P>
 The council gave its OK to the construction by Village Properties, Inc. of 91 
single family homes on a 24-acre lot near Upland and Flynn roads in the city's 
Pitts Ranch area. The development is contingent upon completion of the 
mile-long channelization of Calleguas Creek proposed by the Ventura County 
Flood Control Department. J.E. MITCHELL

 Other residents of the Las Casitas neighborhood said the boy had a "tough" 
reputation. Only a day before Wednesday's fatal shooting, they said, the youth 
had jokingly held an unloaded gun to an acquaintance's head and pulled the 
trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked to play too much," said 21-year-old Alfredo Morales, who said the 
youth tried to scare him with the gun earlier this week at the condominium 
complex where the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Jacqueline Ann Reay died Wednesday afternoon after the boy 
shot her in the eye with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun at point-blank 
range, investigators said. On Thursday, they said the gun belonged to the boy's 
father and had been taken without permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators would not comment on the circumstances surrounding the 
shooting, saying it would be up to the district attorney's office to decide 
what charges, if any, to file against the youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Although parents who leave guns within reach of children can be held 
criminally liable for an accident, sheriff's officials said it did not appear 
that the boy's father had been negligent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no indication there's any culpability on his part," said Lt. Craig 
Husband, who supervises the major crimes unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, coroner's officials who performed an autopsy ruled Jacqueline's 
death a homicide caused by a penetrating gunshot wound to the head. Without 
commenting further on the case, Assistant Medical Examiner-Coroner Fred Walker 
said her death seemed to meet the legal definition of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Penal Code defines manslaughter as "the unlawful killing of a human 
being without malice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to reviewing physical evidence and witness statements, Husband 
said deputies also are following up on reports that the youth had previously 
brandished a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Morales said, he was watching television at the condo where the 
shooting occurred when the boy asked him: "What would you do if someone pulled 
out a gun and pointed it to your head?" 
</P>
<P>
 Morales said he then felt the teen-ager press a gun barrel against the side of 
his head, followed by the question: "What would you do if I pulled the 
trigger?" 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened, Morales asked the youth to put the gun away. Instead, the boy 
pulled the trigger but the ammunition clip had been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline's friends, who gathered at the condo Thursday, said the couple had 
been dating about two months and spent most of their time together. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as they met they liked each other," said 15-year-old Deanna Doney, at 
whose home the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie didn't have any big plan in life. She just wanted to marry (the 
17-year-old)," Deanna added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deanna said the couple recently spent a week camping with the boy's family at 
Lake Tahoe and seemed to be getting along fine. On Wednesday, Jacqueline met up 
with her boyfriend at Deanna's house, where she had planned to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
 She was standing in the kitchen when the gun went off. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just waving the gun around and he pointed it at Jackie and it went 
off," said 14-year-old Krista Lambert, who did not witness the killing but 
arrived a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like they were fighting," she said. "The day before everything was 
fine. Everyone was happy."

EFFORT TO PUT POLI STREET ISSUE ON BALLOT FALLS 243 SIGNATURES SHORT; CLOSURE: 
WHETHER OPENING THE ROUTE AT VENTURA HIGH WILL BE VOTED ON IN NOVEMBER IS NOW 
UP TO CITY COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It will be up to Ventura City Council members to decide whether city residents 
vote this year or next on an initiative aimed at ending the closure of Poli 
Street during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the initiative to keep Poli open near Ventura High School failed 
to gather enough signatures to put the measure on November's ballot, City Clerk 
Barbara Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Concerned Citizens of Ventura, a group made up primarily of hillside 
residents whose streets have been affected by the closure, failed to collect 
valid signatures from 15% of the city's registered voters, as required to put 
the initiative on this year's Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8,589 valid names collected fell 243 names short, Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the group did gather more than 10% of voter signatures, the measure 
automatically will go on the ballot in the next city election, scheduled for 
Nov. 7, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not soon enough for the organizers, who say they are tired of the 
inconvenience and congestion caused by the street's closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they need there is an overpass, and this has been on the back burner for 
45 years," said Jack Biller, 73, a Ventura resident since 1947. "This is a very 
emotional issue, and we want a solution to it soon. If (Poli) is closed, it 
makes things impossible for the people here on the hills." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council can still put the measure on this year's ballot, but members 
have been divided on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jack Tingstrom said he and council members Rosa Lee Measures and 
Jim Monahan support putting the measure before voters this November. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't get the necessary amount, but they've got 8,000 signatures," 
Tingstrom said. "It's obviously a big issue for a lot of people. Let's get this 
thing before the people as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom, who attended Ventura High School, said he does not see the opening 
or closure of the road as a solution to the problem. He thinks the debate will 
not subside until the campus is rearranged or an overpass is built. Other 
council members could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of protests from students, parents and teachers, the City Council 
agreed last August to close the 270-foot section of Poli Street that bisects 
the Ventura High School campus. City officials said the road was dangerous for 
students to cross because of traffic and the possibility of drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The street closure was intended to be a temporary measure until a long-term 
solution is found, said Joseph Richards, assistant superintendent of business 
services for the Ventura Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards said the school board plans to discuss Poli Street on Tuesday, and 
will continue negotiating with hillside residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, board members adamantly oppose opening the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it would do is open the possibility of an accident waiting to happen," 
Richards said. "We hope that the community is interested in the welfare of its 
students."

COMMON GOALS; THOUSAND OAKS SOCCER CAMP RECRUITS WORLD CUP PLAYER TO HELP BUILD 
YOUNGSTERS' DREAMS, TEACH LESSONS IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On warm summer evenings nearly a decade ago, Eric Wynalda and his friends from 
Westlake High School used to grab their cleats and a soccer ball and head for 
the giant playing fields at Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no soccer camps at Cal Lutheran then, no coaches drilling shots on 
goal or passing plays. There was only a wide expanse of vacant turf. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the years since, the block of short-cropped grass across the street 
from the Thousand Oaks university has become a classroom of sorts, where the 
leaders of a program called Soccer Direct teach youngsters self-esteem, 
perseverance, teamwork, and -- thanks to the World Cup -- even geography. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also become a field of dreams for hundreds of young soccer players who 
fantasize about becoming future Eric Wynaldas: members of the U.S. national 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish this had been around when I was a kid," Wynalda said Thursday during a 
visit to the Soccer Direct camp. "This is where it really all starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Each summer, about 1,900 youngsters, mostly from Ventura County, storm the Cal 
Lutheran field to participate in Soccer Direct's day and residential camps, 
which cost from $85 to $395 depending on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Dan and George Kuntz started Soccer Direct 16 years ago in Arizona, 
but for the last six years the summer program has been based in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer teaches you life lessons," said George Kuntz, the program's 
co-director and women's soccer coach at Pepperdine University in Malibu. "It 
teaches you how to work together toward common goals, how to solve problems, 
how to set and achieve small goals for yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuntz, who has been friends with Wynalda and his family for many years, 
invited the soccer star to speak to a group of 30 girls and boys attending a 
special shooting and goal-keeping camp this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to set goals for yourself," the 25-year-old Wynalda told the 
star-struck players, many of whom were clutching balls and pens, hoping for an 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 15, I said I wanted to be on the national team," Wynalda told 
them. "I was cut from every district team until I was 18 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 His lesson did not land of deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned that you can't get down on yourself," said 11-year-old Karina 
Siam of Northridge. "You just have to keep shooting and shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Stretching her long legs before a late-morning session, 12-year-old Kendra 
Shaner of Camarillo said she has learned more in two days at Soccer Direct than 
she had at any other sports camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I just learned the game," said the blond goalkeeper, who has been 
in league play for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 For Todd Hammerslag, who will be a freshman at Westlake High School in the 
fall, the highlight of the program was playing soccer with a barefoot Wynalda. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awesome, playing with him and stuff," said Todd, 13. "I want to play 
on the national team." 
</P>
<P>
 With the World Cup played on American soil for the first time, the Kuntz 
brothers put a new spin on their program this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, the children staying in Cal Lutheran dorms as part of the 
residential camp watch footage of World Cup games. During practices the kids 
are divided into mock teams, playing Brazil or Sweden in their own 
international tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, what we will bring to children in our camps, and are beginning to 
see more of, is an awareness of world cultures," said Dan Kuntz, the program's 
other director and the men's and women's soccer coach at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Stephanie Brazell, who has four children enrolled in various Soccer 
Direct camps this summer, said the World Cup has heightened her children's 
interest in distant places. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually a good geography lesson," said the Thousand Oaks resident. "You 
always need a good motivation to learn, and what better motivation than the 
World Cup?" 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Casey Schmidt has never needed any motivation. An avid soccer 
player since the age of 4, Casey fell in love with the Cameroon team long 
before the Africans landed in Oxnard for pre-tournament training this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends at school, they say, 'Why Cameroon?' " Casey said. "I really like 
their freewheeling style of play." 
</P>
<P>
 Casey's father, Jim Schmidt, a professor at Cal Lutheran, added: "You can ask 
him about any team in the World Cup and he'll give you the capital of that 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan Kuntz said youngsters learn more from the game than simply where the 
players come from. "There's no better language than the soccer ball," he said. 
"It transcends all cultures."

MARTIN R. MILLER, FORMER COUNTY PLANNING LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Russell Miller, a former Ventura County Planning Commission chairman, 
has died after a lengthy battle with cancer and heart disease. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Camarillo businessman, Miller served as the commission's chairman 
during the late 195Os, according to his wife of 55 years, Patricia Russell 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner and operator of the former Camarillo Lumber Co. for more than 20 years, 
Miller was an avid woodworker and carpenter. In 1970, he sold the business, 
which is no longer operating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin was the kind of person that would sell someone a window and then go 
out to their house to help that person with the installation," said Patricia 
Miller, 80. "He did it because he liked helping people but also because he 
really enjoyed building things." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Illinois, Miller was raised in Washington state, where he attended 
public schools and, eventually, the University of Washington. He moved to 
California in the mid-1920s and married the former Patricia Russell in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers lived in the Westlake area since the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was also a sportsman who especially liked hunting and sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would crew with friends on boats," his widow said. "He really liked being 
out on the ocean. He also liked to go hunting occasionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the lumber business, Miller and his wife raised and showed prize 
Appaloosa horses and still had several on their Westlake property at the time 
of his death Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raising and showing the horses was something that we both enjoyed very much," 
Patricia Miller said. "It takes a fair amount of skill and patience, but the 
fruits of your labor can be very rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had no children. The Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Mortuary is 
handling arrangements.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; IN CONCERT, AT LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The announcement that the Orange County Performing Arts Center and the Orange 
County Philharmonic Society jointly will sponsor two ethnic events this year at 
the Costa Mesa auditorium was music to the ears, a welcome sign that the 
sometimes bitter relationship between the groups has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its previous leaders, the center tried to exert too much control over 
what the Philharmonic Society presented when the society rented the hall.The 
center defined its mission as presenting classical music, opera and ballet, 
which was fine. But its hand was too heavy when it told the Philharmonic, which 
sometimes rents the venue to put on performances, to limit presentations to 
touring symphony orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic had to struggle to present other groups of artistic merit at 
the center, such as the Chieftains and their Irish folk songs or Les Ballets 
Africains from the Republic of Guinea. Popular, non-classical groups often sold 
out, which had the advantage of helping the Philharmonic cover losses incurred 
in presenting less popular but musically worthwhile classical groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the center's new executive director, Tom Tomlinson, struck the right 
note in saying he hoped the center would reflect the ethnic diversity of Orange 
County. This week's announcement of joint sponsorship of a Spanish flamenco 
dance company and a mariachi celebration was evidence that Tomlinson indeed is 
open to change. The Philharmonic will benefit from the center's marketing 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's opening nearly eight years ago was a sign of the county's 
cultural coming of age. It was privately built, funded and managed. Because it 
is private, the center can call its own tune. But because it serves the entire 
community, it needs to be sensitive to audiences eager to see various forms of 
culture. That makes good sense artistically and economically.

MIKE PENNER: JIMMIE'S 50 SHOULD STAY IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first I was thinking they should name Anaheim Stadium after Jimmie Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anaheim Stadium, at age 28, is past its prime, out of date and out of 
fashion, which is something Jimmie, in all his 92 3/4 years, never was. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie deserves better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they can name the new stadium after him, if and when it is built. Jimmie 
Reese Park has a nice ring. Fungo Field. And play some Jimmie Reese highlights 
on the scoreboard every game -- Jimmie autographing baseballs down the 
left-field foul line, Jimmie joshing with the players, Jimmie lofting fungoes 
into the right-center field gap and dropping them, like magic, into a plastic 
bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 Beats watching on-the-field Angel highlights from the last 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe they can start on something right away, get it done yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Jimmie's uniform number, old No. 50, and paint it on the right-field 
fence, right next to Gene Autry's 26 and Rod Carew's 29 and Nolan Ryan's 30. 
Let everyone who walks through those turnstiles know what No. 50 meant to this 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 That he represented grace and class for a team that too often went 0-for-2 in 
those departments. 
</P>
<P>
 That he elevated the status of those around him simply by his presence. 
</P>
<P>
 That he generated more goodwill and publicity for this team in a single day 
than a thousand spin-doctoring press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 That he was Jimmie Reese, the most valuable person the Angels ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter threw out the idea to General Manager Bill Bavasi shortly after 
Jimmie died Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just thinking about that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie belongs on that wall, if for no other reason than the fact he managed 
to last 22 consecutive seasons with the banana republic of major league 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie outlasted 11 Angel field managers, six Angel general managers, three 
Angel uniform styles, 10 Angel youth movements, 10 Angel go-with-experience 
movements, 10 Angel let's-buy-us-a-pennant budgetary programs, 10 Angel 
we-better-tighten-our-belts budgetary programs and a couple of hundred players 
who were absolutely going to turn the Angels around and never did. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two decades, Jimmie served in the official capacity of 
conditioning coach and the unofficial capacity of spirit-lifter for the Angels. 
In retrospect, he might have been better suited to be general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie's two closest friends on the Angels were Nolan Ryan and Jim Abbott. 
This is no accident. Jimmie had an eye for quality, be it personality or the 
ability to paint the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 GM Jimmie would have never let Ryan and Abbott out of his sight, let alone out 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, it is surprising the Angels never made it to the World Series, 
because Jimmie gave the Angels an unfair advantage over the competition. He was 
a performance-enhancing additive, an emotional upper. Anabolic steroids for the 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes spent with Jimmie put a spring in your step and a smile on your 
face. Whether he was playing willing victim for a clubhouse prank or winning a 
Coca-Cola bet with his fungo-hitting accuracy or retelling tall tales of 
rooming with Babe Ruth -- or Babe Ruth's suitcase, as Jimmie loved to put it -- 
Jimmie always managed to improve life with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 And for that, he deserved a dozen lifetime contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 During the grim years of the early and mid-1980s, when the Angels laid claim 
to the surliest clubhouse in the big leagues, Jimmie's locker stall was a happy 
oasis amid the snarling and the sniping. Often, Jimmie's locker stall was the 
only one occupied after a tough Angel loss. Or victory. Writers needed quotes 
for their stories, so there was Jimmie, setting the record for most postgame 
interviews granted by a conditioning coach. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a source for those stories he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to know how Ryan compared to Walter Johnson? Jimmie could tell you. 
Jimmie saw them both. 
</P>
<P>
 (Ryan threw harder, Jimmie said, but Johnson won more because he had better 
support.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie was a world-class yarn spinner, and he was sharper with a one-liner in 
his 90s than most of the twenty- and thirtysomethings around him. A simple "How 
you doing, Jimmie?" would elicit a wink, a sly smile and "Well, I woke up 
today. So I can't complain." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie would razz players young enough to be his great-grandchildren and the 
players would give it right back to him. The players loved that about Jimmie. 
Don't let up on Jimmie just because he was born six months after the American 
League. Give me your best stuff, he would goad them. Let's see some heat. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bo Jackson would eat a banana, poke his head out of the players lounge and 
hit Jimmie with the peel when he wasn't looking. By the time Jimmie turned 
around, Bo was out of sight, heading through a side exit and strolling out the 
trainer's room on the other side of the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo would then tap Jimmie on the shoulder and say "Hey, Jimmie," pretending to 
be oblivious to the hit job. 
</P>
<P>
 This went on for weeks before Jimmie finally caught him in the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie was steaming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not mad at you," Jimmie told Bo. "I'm mad at myself. All this time, I've 
been cussing out the wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
 When his health began to fail him last year, Jimmie had to sit out the second 
half of the season. At the same time, the Angels plunged into a tailspin that 
took them from first place to fifth. Some of the players blamed Jimmie's 
absence for the slump, an excuse that struck many outside Orange County as 
fairly lame. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jimmie had that kind of effect on a person. Players grew attached to him 
when he was around and concerned when he wasn't. It was a sad day for everyone 
last month when Jimmie hung up No. 50 and checked into a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone feared that would be the last time No. 50 would be making an 
appearance at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The obituary in Thursday's newspaper said Jimmie left no survivors. This 
couldn't be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Reese is survived by every player, coach and manager who came to know 
him; by every fan who shook his hand and heard an encouraging word; by every 
beat writer who walked away from Jimmie's locker a little smarter than he or 
she had been before. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Reese is survived by baseball. So put his number on the outfield fence, 
for all his family members to see. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, No. 50 can make an appearance at Anaheim Stadium every day. 
</P>

STRAWBERRY GETS HIS FIRST HOMER FOR SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry hit his first major-league home run in more than a year, a 
grand slam for the San Francisco Giants on Thursday night against Montreal. 
Strawberry's first homer for the Giants came in the fifth inning off Pedro 
Martinez and gave San Francisco a 7-1 lead.He had an RBI single in the first 
before later connecting for his sixth career slam. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry began the day 1-for-11 with no RBIs in four games for San 
Francisco. The Giants had won every game in which he played. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's last home run came on June 8, 1993, for Los Angeles. He was 
placed on the disabled list 10 days later because of back problems and missed 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-time All-Star outfielder left the Dodgers without permission in 
April on the last day of spring training. He later said he had a substance 
abuse problem and spent 28 days in a treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry and the Dodgers negotiated a settlement in which he was released 
without playing a game this season. He was signed by the Giants on June 19 and 
played three games for Triple-A Phoenix, hitting two home runs.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; WHITHER A CUP FOR WOMEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where are the women? 
</P>
<P>
 This is what I wonder most. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watch (and watch and watch) these patriot games, these World Cup 
shoot-'em-ups, I am aware of their many similarities to the Olympics, the same 
rich pageantry, the same painted faces, the same love for fatherland or 
motherland. There is only one thing missing. Well, a whole lot of one thing, 
actually. 
</P>
<P>
 The women. 
</P>
<P>
 Next summer in Sweden, the second world championships of women's soccer will 
be contested. Quick quiz: Anybody know who won the first? Hurry, now. Clock's 
ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil? 
</P>
<P>
 Bzzzzz. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil was weak," remembers Karen Stanley, women's soccer coach for USC who 
was there. "A good college team could have beaten Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States? 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, as a matter of fact, yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Alan Rothenberg (U.S. soccer federation president) standing up 
before some big World Cup thing and addressing the issue: 'When are we ever 
going to win a world championship?' " Stanley was saying Thursday, after 
attending the previous day's game between Brazil and Sweden. (At that men's 
tournament.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I got kind of hot. I wanted to shout: 'Wait a minute. We did win a world 
championship.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley traveled to China for those 12-team finals in 1991. They were the 
first actual world championships for women, fully backed by FIFA. Oh, except, 
once again, there was one thing missing. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't called World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 As Stanley recalls, "They said there's only one World Cup, and that's the 
men's World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, I thought there was only one Olympics, for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Are American women any good at soccer? Here's how good. In qualifying rounds 
for the '91 finals, they outscored their opposition, 49-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they wiped out their first-round group, Sweden, Brazil and Japan. Then 
they played Chinese Taipei and squeaked by . . . 7-0. Then they took care of 
Germany in the semifinal, 5-2, with Carin Gabarra scoring three times in the 
opening 32 minutes. And then they won the final over Norway, 2-1, after which 
Seattle native Michelle Akers-Stahl was awarded the "golden boot" for most 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 And then they came home. 
</P>
<P>
 The champions were met at the airport in New York by exactly one man, carrying 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley says, "Not only did our women win the championship of the world 
without anybody knowing we did it, nobody seemed to even know that such a thing 
even existed." 
</P>
<P>
 The official U.S. soccer guide has 160 pages. The women get three. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, as goalkeeper Amy Allman later said, "It's better than one page." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the women from the U.S. team are hardly school kids. Allman, for 
example, coaches at the University of New Mexico. And one of the top players is 
Joy Fawcett, who broke scoring records at the University of California and now 
coaches UCLA. Even though she just had a baby a few weeks ago, Fawcett played 
soccer at last week's U.S. Olympic Festival in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Women can make a good living playing soccer. Akers-Stahl is quite successful 
in a pro league in Sweden. Mary Harvey, a 5-foot-4 goalkeeper from Cal, plays 
in the same league. Competition is prospering in other parts of the world as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a long, slow haul," says Stanley, who is working for SoccerFest during 
World Cup '94 and laboring with a women's soccer foundation to educate more of 
the world that men aren't the only ones who know how to kick a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the top teams I've seen so far, Norway, Sweden, our own, come from 
countries with a slightly more liberated attitude toward women. But things seem 
to be improving everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, I'll have to ask some of these Brazil people this weekend, do they 
even know that Brazil has a women's team?" 
</P>
<P>
 I'll ask too. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, women's soccer will be a medal sport at the Summer Olympics in 1996 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a women's World Cup in 1998, same as the men's? 
</P>
<P>
 American women. Bulgarian women. Nigerian women. Norwegian women. Korean 
women. Saudi Arabian women. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Saudi men might have something to say about that. Otherwise, though, 
this has real possibilities.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; GOING OVERBOARD; SOCCER'S 'DIVERS' TAKE PLUNGE 
IN ATTEMPT TO GAIN AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE, AND FOR REFEREES THERE IS A CERTAIN 
DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY IN MAKING CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They take more dives than Greg Louganis, but theirs rarely end with a splash. 
</P>
<P>
 It's more like a crash when soccer players come tumbling down, legs and arms 
flailing like a broken windmill, faces etched in agony. One moment they are 
lying on the ground, writhing in pain; a minute later they are sprinting with 
the ball toward an opponent's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the acting part of soccer," said Paul Caligiuri, a defender on the U.S. 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
 The deceptive nature of soccer becomes obvious when some players try to gain 
an advantage by faking a foul or injury after colliding with an opponent. 
Usually it is the player trying to push forward on offense. But it works both 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Caligiuri is still talking about the World Cup in 1990, when Nicola Berti of 
Italy took a dive and drew a penalty kick at the defender's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the experts at getting a call from the refs," Caligiuri said. 
</P>
<P>
 The replays showed Caligiuri did nothing to deserve a foul. As Berti dribbled 
past two Americans he confronted Caligiuri, the last line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what he was going to do," Caligiuri recalled. "It really disappointed 
me. I was standing on 
</P>
<P>
 top of the (penalty) box. I just stood there, legs together and arms up, and 
he just dove right by me. He started his dive outside the box." 
</P>
<P>
 But Berti got a favorable call. If there was any justice, Italy's penalty kick 
hit the post and bounced wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Players try to gain free kicks by faking fouls, or better yet, getting an 
opponent a yellow card. Sometimes, it is done to waste time to allow their team 
to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a game that turns on a single play, one foul or free kick can be the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Who me?" expressions, most players deny doing it. Yet, for those 
watching the monthlong World Cup, there is a nagging feeling that it is 
intrinsic to soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans have seen the best acting since Montgomery Clift as players have 
taken the plunge throughout the Cup, although experts say it has decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Italy (in 1990) we had this continuously," said David Will, chairman of 
FIFA's referees' committee. "It improved out of sight at this World Cup. 
Players realize referees are up to all their tricks." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some try. And sometimes referees tolerate it -- to a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Will said referees were instructed before World Cup '94 to give players a 
yellow card if there is a deliberate attempt to cheat or waste time. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, referees simply signal for a player to rise and get on with the game. 
Most obey, but there are always those who refuse to back off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best actor?" pondered Andreas Koepke, a German goalkeeper. "Maybe 
(Hristo) Stoitchkov. A lot do it. You must accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov and his Bulgarian teammates were flabbergasted that the talented 
striker would be accused of such a heinous offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov simply shook his head and walked away when asked about diving. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nasko Sirakov, Bulgaria's attacking midfielder: "Normally, we don't like 
it when players do that. But some still do it. Who? Teams with warmer blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Stoitchkov does play for FC Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 "No tricks from the Bulgarians," said Boncho Guentchev, a reserve forward. 
</P>
<P>
 So who, then? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Colombian players," he said. "Maybe the last five minutes in a close 
game. It's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Although diving is frowned on in the German and English professional leagues, 
Juergen Klinsmann's name was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a bit dramatic and tends to get calls in his favor," Caligiuri said. 
</P>
<P>
 The big-time players usually gain the referees' sympathy but not without 
reason. Most of the dangerous strikers are fiercely guarded and take some 
brutal hits. So the great ones such as Stoitchkov, Klinsmann, Diego Maradona of 
Argentina and Gheorghe Hagi of Romania are protected. 
</P>
<P>
 When referees gather at a favorite watering hole, the conversation inevitably 
turns to the notorious divers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't expect me to name names," said Will. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I can't, but the referees know who they are . . . the players who are 
famous for this. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a problem, but we'll never get rid of it. There will still be prima 
donnas who will take a dive." 
</P>
<P>
 Romario, Brazil's brilliant striker, however, has earned respect from 
defenders for not trying to take advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's constantly getting fouled but not looking to get a foul called," 
Caligiuri said. "That puts him above the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Borislav Mihaylov, Bulgaria's goalkeeper, also respects those who do not fake 
it. He said diving is risky because if a player feigns injury he could be taken 
off the field, leaving his team a man short. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA, soccer's governing body, has mandated that injured players must be 
treated on the sidelines. The player re-enters the game at the referee's 
discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could cause a goal," Mihaylov said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when someone is genuinely injured? Sometimes, the referee cannot determine 
the force of the collision and ignores the crumpled player on the field. FIFA 
officials have emphasized keeping the ball in play, and referees are judged by 
doing so. Thus, they do everything in their power to keep the ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Will said if referees seem indifferent at times it is the players' fault for 
faking it so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wind up cutting their own throats," he said.

KING INDICTED BY GRAND JURY; BOXING: CONTROVERSIAL PROMOTER ALLEGEDLY FILED A 
FALSE INSURANCE CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don King, the electric-haired promoter whose name is synonymous with boxing 
controversy, was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday in New York for 
allegedly filing a false insurance claim involving a 1991 bout that was 
canceled because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-count indictment, which could result in maximum five-year sentences 
and fines on each of the counts, alleges that, after Julio Cesar Chavez cut his 
nose before he could fight Harold Brazier, King lied to Lloyd's of London about 
his contract with Chavez in order to collect $350,000 from the London-based 
insurance carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who has promoted former heavyweight champions Muhammad Ali and Mike 
Tyson among a long list of fighters, is scheduled to be arraigned July 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am completely innocent," King said in a written statement released Thursday 
afternoon. "I have done nothing to warrant this action. . . . I will be 
cleared." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Marley, a spokesman for Don King Productions, said that the 
indictments will not disturb the company's pending promotions -- among them a 
Sept. 17 card at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas featuring Chavez against Meldrick 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don King's been through a lot of legal battles and so far his record is 
perfect," Marley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction in the boxing community -- among King's enemies, friends and the rare 
neutral party -- was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been reports for almost all of the grand jury's two-year 
investigation that King would be brought up on a far broader range of charges 
than the comparatively narrow indictment issued. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a cancer on the sport of boxing and a lot of his activities have 
brought the sport to a position of disrepute," said Bob Arum, one of King's 
bitterest rivals. "The sport of boxing would be infinitely better without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this guy seems to have more lives than a cat." 
</P>
<P>
 King has been investigated by at least two other grand juries and one FBI 
sting operation. In 1985, he was acquitted in federal court of tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, before he became involved in boxing, King killed a man who was 
robbing a numbers house operated by King in Cleveland, but it was ruled 
self-defense. In 1967, King was convicted in Cleveland of beating to death Sam 
Garrett, a man who owed him money, and he served four years in prison. He was 
pardoned in 1983 by then-Ohio Gov. James A. Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his day of comeuppance, finally, has come," said manager Bill Cayton, 
who sued King after Tyson left Cayton to join King's stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sayatovich disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been investigating him for two years, spent all that money and time, 
and this is what they come up with?" said the San Diego-based manager who whose 
top fighter, World Boxing Council junior-middleweight champion Terry Norris, is 
promoted by King. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tells me someone is out to get him. Don King has been bulletproof from 
the time we've started doing business with him. He has always done for us what 
he has promised. So no, I'm not worried." 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM Grand, which has staged most of King's biggest shows in the last year, 
said in a written statement that it would "take our direction" from the Nevada 
State Athletic Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada commission, said there will be 
no hasty decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had no problems whatsoever with him in this state, financially or 
otherwise," Ratner said. "He's been indicted, not convicted, and until there is 
a court disposition, he is innocent until proven guilty."

SIMI VALLEY COACH SCYPHERS GETS APPROVAL TO RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley High baseball Coach Mike Scyphers gained unanimous school-board 
approval Thursday to return as coach next season, ending 73 days of 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The five members of the Simi Valley Unified School District board, who voted 
after a 75-minute meeting with Scyphers, approved his return after he agreed to 
a year's probation, during which he will have to abide by 10 stipulations 
regulating his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Scyphers nor representatives of the school district would specify the 
stipulations, but Scyphers said one of them was that he no longer use a 
traditional team disciplinary practice called "the block," in which players bid 
small amounts of money for the right to paddle teammates who violate rules. The 
practice violated the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers also agreed to remain on campus during school hours, a disciplinary 
action suggested by Principal Kathryn Scroggin. Scyphers was able to persuade 
the board members to remove one of Scroggin's disciplinary measures: that he 
supply the school with a schedule of the college basketball games he officiates 
in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers was suspended as baseball coach May 3, after police and the school 
district began investigating allegations of financial and disciplinary 
improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "the block," Scyphers admitted to improperly accepting $2,000 from an 
adult baseball organization for the use of the baseball field at Simi Valley 
High, violating district rules. Scyphers used part of that money to pay his 
assistant coaches without the knowledge of the district, a Southern Section 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who has led the Pioneers to national prominence during his 16 
seasons, was cleared by the Ventura County district attorney of criminal 
wrongdoing on June 8. His suspension was lifted the next day. But because all 
coaches in the district are on one-year contracts, Scyphers needed the board's 
approval to return.

 The Kansas City Royals released outfielder Hubie Brooks, who possibly ends his 
14-year, 1,645-game career. The lifetime .269 hitter spent most of his career 
in the National League, including 1990 with the Dodgers. Brooks, who was with 
the Angels in 1992, had 14 hits in 61 at-bats for the Royals this season after 
making the team as a nonroster invitee. . . . Colorado catcher Joe Girardi was 
put on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to Monday, because of inflammation 
in his left patellar tendon.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINALS; YESTER-YEARNING; TO SPOILED FANS OF THE 
BEAUTIFUL GAME, BRAZIL OF TODAY IS SIMPLY WINNING UGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be going too far to suggest that U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic was 
satisfied after his team's 1-0 loss in the second round of the 1994 World Cup. 
But neither was he dissatisfied. Considering the opponent that July 4 afternoon 
at Stanford Stadium, who could have asked for more? 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil," he said, "is Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 As he made that remark, intended as the supreme compliment to one of the 
world's preeminent soccer powers, one could feel the breeze as far away as Palo 
Alto as 150 million Brazilians shook their heads in dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 This Brazil team might be the best in the world today. This Brazil team might 
win the World Cup with a victory over Italy on Sunday in the championship game 
at the Rose Bowl. But this Brazil team, critics from Sao Paulo to Rio de 
Janeiro declare, is not Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: This is not the Brazil of Pele, not the Brazil that retired the 
Jules Rimet Trophy with three World Cup titles between 1958-70 and not the 
Brazil of jogo bonito, the beautiful game. 
</P>
<P>
 This team, the critics claim, is masquerading as Brazil, and for that Coach 
Carlos Alberto Parreira has been apportioned most of the blame. On Wednesday at 
the Rose Bowl, where Brazil beat Sweden, 1-0, to advance to the final for the 
first time in 24 years, he was the object of derisive whistles and boos during 
pregame introductions and again whenever his picture was displayed on the 
stadium's big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira's most ardent defender has been Mario Zagalo, the 62-year-old 
assistant who had to be physically restrained from attacking fans who jeered 
the coach at the airport upon the team's return home from a loss at Bolivia 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anyone else, Zagalo can empathize with Parreira. During an interview 
at the team's Fullerton headquarters Tuesday, Zagalo recalled the 
second-guessing he withstood as head coach of the 1970 team, considered by many 
to be the best to play in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure hasn't changed," he said. "It's just that there are more people 
now. We had 90 million people in Brazil in 1970. Today, we have 150 million. In 
other words, there were 90 million Brazilian coaches then, 150 million today." 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira, 51, has complained that his critics are living in the past, failing 
to accept the realities of today's soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that Pele is retired, never to return. Another is that more countries 
play the sport well than in 1970, when Brazil outscored its opponents, 19-7, 
and was held to fewer than three goals only once in six games. It won the 
championship game over Italy, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The distance between us and the other teams is much smaller," he said this 
week. "There is no gulf anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 And another reality is that the game, for better or worse, has evolved 
defensively, rendering the uninhibited, free-flowing offensive advances 
virtually obsolete. Teams in this World Cup have seemed particularly intent on 
preventing Brazil from displaying its panache, retreating so vigorously that 
they all but forfeit any chances of their own to score. In six games, only 42 
shots have been fired at the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a saying in Brazil that if only one person comes to fight, you can't 
have a fight," Parreira said after a first-round 1-1 tie with Sweden in which 
the opponents tried only four shots. They were not even that bold in the 
semifinal rematch, attempting only three. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians tried for two decades to resist the tide, leaving themselves 
vulnerable to counterattacks in one World Cup disappointment after another. 
Then they overcompensated in 1990 with Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni's defensive 
posture, which included the use of a European-style sweeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "No more jogo bonito ," midfielder Dunga proclaimed. "This is the Brazil of 
sweat and sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 It also was the Brazil that scored only four goals in four games and was 
eliminated in the second round by Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 When Parreira became the coach, he promised that Brazil would be a team of 
sweat and sacrifice and jogo bonito . 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Brazil wins or loses Sunday, many experts -- outside Brazil -- will 
agree that Parreira has done everything he can to achieve that blend with the 
talent he has. 
</P>
<P>
 He has fielded a team on which marvelous strikers such as Romario and Bebeto 
can coexist with gritty midfielders such as Dunga, Zinho and Mauro Silva; and 
on which central defenders Aldair and Marcio Santos hold their ground so 
steadfastly that the left and right backs, Branco and Jorginho, can make 
frequent forays into the offensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past five World Cups we have been favorites, and where have we finished?" 
Parreira asked before the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Not waiting for a reply, he said: "Nowhere. Balance will win this World Cup." 
That balance has produced 11 goals and given up only three. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Parreira's efforts, this team is not likely to be remembered as one of 
the best -- or even one of Brazil's best -- because of its uncharacteristic 
inability to maneuver the ball through the midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the team's playmaking No. 10, Rai, was considered as recently as two 
years ago as one of the world's best, he slumped in recent months to the extent 
that polls in Brazil revealed that fans there did not even want him selected to 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true, we lack creativity," Parreira said in May. "I look, but I don't 
find it. The fact is, Brazil today doesn't have a great No. 10 jersey any more, 
like a Rivelino, an Ademir da Guia or a Zico. Zico was the last. Give me one, 
and I'll put him on the team right now." 
</P>
<P>
 When no one stepped forward, Parreira started Rai in the first three games but 
benched him in favor of Mazinho before the second round. Mazinho has not been 
entirely satisfactory, and Romario, who prefers to plant himself in the penalty 
area and wait for the ball, has had to make expeditions into the midfield to 
search for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario and Bebeto have combined for eight goals, but, with their scoring 
touch, they might have recorded spectacular numbers if they had someone to get 
them the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps historians will not fawn over these Brazilians. But if they win the 
World Cup, perhaps their fans at home finally will.

ITALY IN ECSTASY AFTER AGONIZING GAME; REACTION: NATIONWIDE CELEBRATION HERALDS 
SEMIFINAL VICTORY OVER BULGARIA; THREE DIE IN RELATED INCIDENTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Roars resounded throughout Rome on Wednesday night, breaking the otherwise 
uncanny silence that prevailed while most Romans stayed glued to their 
television sets watching the national soccer team work its way to the World Cup 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 The punctuating sound came after Roberto Baggio's two goals in the first half 
and after the final whistle, which ended the national agony of watching an 
exhausted team defend its one-goal lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Only seconds later, Rome's streets were awash with the customary cheering 
crowds, honking horns, trumpets, streamers and banners. The scene was repeated 
in the streets of every city throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, joy-riding and cheering fans inadvertently caused three deaths. One 
exuberant Roman fell off a moped into the path of an oncoming car; in the 
fireworks-happy southern city of Bari, a group preparing a homemade celebration 
inadvertently set off an explosion of their cache and one person was killed; 
and in a small town near Rome, a girl was fatally struck by the car of a soccer 
fan speeding home to watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
 After each step that Italy has taken toward the final, the jubilation has been 
more intense. Baggio's tears of exhaustion or pain or joy were seen and shared 
by fans and sports editors all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 He was proclaimed the hero in all of the headlines and news reports Thursday. 
"Baggio tears of joy and sorrow" was the headline over the sports page in the 
Milan daily, Corriere della Sera. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have already said that my Karma was suffering. But you can change your 
Karma," the player, a Buddhist, was quoted as saying. "I don't think, however, 
that this was my best game. . . . I especially want to play a better one: the 
final." 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's most-read sporting daily, the Milanese La Gazzetta dello Sport, 
carried a front-page editorial by Candido Cannavo, summing up the trials and 
tribulations of the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . Drunk with all the joys, criticisms, contradictions and paradoxes, 
Italy drops anchor in the paradise of the World Cup final. And moors 
triumphantly. This time, what is by now unavoidable suffering is mixed with an 
irresistible wave of bravura. We are still wide-eyed and breathless. Our 
national team offered us half an hour of sublime soccer . . . comparable only 
to Brazil at the early second half of their game with Holland." 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio's two goals, wrote Cannavo, should be framed in diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baggio explodes, Azzurri in the finals" exults the front-page headline of the 
Turin daily La Stampa, calling his achievement "two fairy-tale goals."

WORLD CUP USA 1994; NEW LEAGUE GETS SPONSORS TO SUPPLY BALLS, UNIFORMS; SOCCER: 
ROTHENBERG, HOPING TO RAISE $100 MILLION, SAYS MORE ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL COME IN 
THE NEXT SIX WEEKS. 
</P>

<P>
 Working quickly to capitalize on World Cup enthusiasm, organizers of the 
proposed new professional soccer league on Thursday announced its first two 
sponsors -- a company that will provide the soccer balls and another that will 
provide uniforms for half the league's teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to potential sponsors at a private club in Pasadena, World Cup '94 
chairman Alan Rothenberg detailed what he said was the unprecedented success of 
the World Cup and suggested that the increased public interest in soccer would 
act as a springboard for the new league, which he also heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Major League Soccer is expected to begin play next April. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg said he hoped to raise up to $100 million, but the league has not 
announced major sponsors or investors. Rothenberg said such announcements would 
come in the next six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even the appearance of two players from the U.S. World Cup team, 
offering their support to MLS, did little to quell rumors that the league will 
have to postpone its start-up for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Alexi Lalas and Marcelo Balboa were careful to qualify their remarks, 
saying they are in favor of a first-division pro soccer league in the United 
States but making no pledge to join it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we want American soccer to succeed," Lalas said. "But we are 
professional athletes, and we have to make a living. There are good 
opportunities overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 Both players are said to be considering jobs in leagues abroad, Lalas with 
Newcastle United in the English league and Balboa in the Mexican league. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though MLS is projected to have teams in 12 cities, only seven have been 
named. The uniform sponsorship announced Thursday covers only six of the 
league's teams. The other half of the league, Rothenberg said, would be 
outfitted in another brand of uniform.MAJOR LEAGUE

REESE TOUCHED MANY WITH HIS MAJOR LEAGUE CLASS; IN MEMORIAM: PEOPLE FROM 
VARIOUS WALKS OF LIFE PAY TRIBUTE TO ANGEL COACH WHOSE SINCERITY WAS LEGENDARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, John Cox was doing the same thing he did every time he had the 
opportunity 20 years ago. Fielding fungoes off a bat swung by Jimmie Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese was in a Santa Ana convalescent center and the staff was having trouble 
persuading him to get out of bed. Angel coach Bobby Knoop had left a few 
baseballs and Reese's favorite fungo bat in the room, so Cox saw his cue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'C'mon, I need a few more,' " Cox said. "We got him in a wheelchair 
and went out on the lawn and he hit me a few. Not real hard, but he hit 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, a supervisor of scouting for the Baltimore Orioles, stood in a visitation 
room at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana Thursday, marveling at his 
memories of the man. Jimmie Reese lay a few feet away, his Angel uniform 
sparkling white, that trusty fungo bat leaning against the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the man who allowed me to do what I've done in this business," said 
Cox, a former scouting director and assistant general manager for 13 years with 
the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angels put an ad in the paper for an open tryout," he said. "About 500 
guys showed up. The coaches picked three of us. I don't know how much Jimmie 
had to do with that decision, but that's when our friendship started and that's 
when my career started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never made it past (Class) A ball as a player. I was middle infielder, one 
of 100,000 good-glove-no-hit guys and the only reason I had a good glove was 
Jimmie Reese. He would hit me fungoes any time I asked and I always asked. He 
would hit them left, then right until you were exhausted. And he always led you 
by just enough that it took all your effort to catch it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we all have to die, but there are some people you just don't want to 
part with. Jimmie always made you feel like you were special. He listened like 
you were the only one around. It was sincere, devoted friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Medlong developed a similar attachment to Reese through her work as a 
manager at the Jolly Roger Inn where Reese usually stayed during Angel home 
stands. She spent a lot of time trying to wriggle some juicy gossip from him, 
but never succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd hear a rumor about a player who was a real jerk, but the worst Jimmie 
would ever say was, 'Oh, he's OK."' she said. "He never said a bad word about 
anyone. Of course, I don't think anyone has ever said a bad word about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is the world would be a lot better place if there were a few more 
like him." 
</P>
<P>
 George Garan owns a cold storage firm close to Anaheim Stadium and met Reese 
at an Angel team function more than 20 years ago. "He picked out my season 
tickets and said, 'Now, all you have to do is pay for them,' " Garan said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmie was the best human being I've ever met," Garan said. "He loved three 
things besides baseball, ice cream, his favorite deli and cigars. At least I 
was able to make sure the freezer in his Westwood apartment was always stocked 
with Dreyer's." 
</P>
<P>
 David Benter, a postal worker from Garden Grove, spoke to Reese once a year, 
but he too feels as if he has lost a friend. As an 11-year-old, Benter got an 
autograph from Reese before a spring training game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know who Jimmie Reese was and he obviously wasn't a player, but 
there was a crowd around him, so I asked for an autograph," Benter said. "He 
signed it and made a point of talking to me. He asked me how long I'd been an 
Angel fan and who my favorite player was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've talked to him almost every spring since then. To me, he is the Angels. 
He's a link to the past, a past that will hopefully come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Reese's legacy will have to carry the burden of bringing back the good old 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 He's busy hitting fungoes to angels in the outfield.

FAIR IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR FISCHER IN HIGH JUMP VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A height of 6 feet 10 3/4 inches was mediocre by Jeremy Fischer's lofty 
standards, but it was enough to win the high jump Thursday in the USA-Canada 
Junior track and field meet at State University of New York at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. men's team won 10 of 12 events to take an 80-49 lead over Canada 
after the first day of the two-day meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory kept Fischer -- a 1994 graduate of Camarillo High -- undefeated in 
outdoor competition this season, but snapped a streak of seven consecutive 
finals in which he cleared 7 feet or higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who set a regional record of 7-4 at the Santa Barbara Easter Relays 
in March, has cleared 7 feet or higher in 11 meets this season. Henry Patterson 
of the U.S. finished second at 6-8 3/4 Thursday, followed by Canadians Mark 
Boswell (6-8 3/4) and Kevin Grant (6-8 3/4). 
</P>
<P>
 "He just seems to jump better when he has to," Camarillo Coach Dennis 
Riedmiller said when informed of Fischer's performance. "I guess that means 
he's going to have to do it in the (World Junior Championships) next week." 
</P>
<P>
 The "it" that Fischer is shooting for is the state high school record of 7-4 
1/2 set by Maurice Crumby of San Francisco Balboa High in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer has taken 15 jumps this season at heights which would have broken or 
equaled the state record, but fallen short. 
</P>
<P>
 After clearing 7-4 in Santa Barbara, he missed three times at 7-5 1/2. He did 
likewise after making 7-3 at the Mt. San Antonio Relays in April. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the Southern Section Division I title at 7-2 1/4 in May before missing 
three attempts at 7-4 3/4, and he missed three times at 7-4 1/2 after winning 
last month's Golden West Invitational at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, he cleared 7-2 1/2 to win the USA Track & Field Junior 
Championships before missing three times at 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Junior championships in Lisbon, Portugal, July 20-24, will be 
Fischer's 23rd -- and final -- meet of the season.

SIMI VALLEY REINSTATES SCYPHERS; BASEBALL: EMBATTLED COACH IS GRANTED 
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL TO RETURN, ENDING 2 1/2-MONTH BATTLE WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Scyphers gained unanimous school board approval Thursday to return as 
baseball coach at Simi Valley High next season, ending 73 days of controversy 
surrounding the successful and often fiery coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The five members of the Simi Valley Unified School District board, who voted 
following a 75-minute hearing with Scyphers, approved his rehiring after he 
agreed to one year of probation, during which he must abide by 10 stipulations 
regulating his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Scyphers nor district representatives would release the entire list of 
stipulations. However, Scyphers said a traditional team disciplinary practice 
called "the block," in which players bid small amounts of money for the right 
to paddle teammates who violated rules, has been prohibited. The practice, 
which Scyphers has used since 1980, violated the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are actually stipulations that all coaches should abide by," Scyphers 
said. "We are all under the same guidelines. Mine just happen to be put in 
writing. It's nothing different than any other coach at our school has to go 
through. . . .. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to go about my business as I always have, minus 'the block,' I 
suppose." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, also may not leave campus during school hours, a disciplinary 
action suggested by Principal Kathryn Scroggin. Scyphers was able to convince 
board members to reject one of Scroggin's measures, that he supply the school 
with a schedule of the college basketball games he officiates in his spare 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, wearing a gray, double-breasted suit, emerged from the hearing at 
the district office with his wife, Sally, and Sue Norman, grievance chairwoman 
of the Simi Educators Assn., a teachers' union. As the board voted inside, 
Scyphers spoke to a group of reporters, joking at times. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Leon Mattingley emerged from the conference room and 
announced, with Scyphers at his side, that the board had approved the coach's 
rehiring and that Scyphers had until July 25 to accept the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers hedged for a few minutes, saying he had "to take a walk with my wife 
and talk about it," but then said he would accept the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who has led the Pioneers to national prominence during his 16 years 
as coach, will be officially confirmed at the next open board meeting on July 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a decision that was reached after a full and complete dialogue," 
Mattingley said. "The board's concerns and Mr. Scyphers' concerns were 
discussed." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who characterized the hearing as calm and orderly, said his concerns 
centered on the stipulations, which were examined by his attorney beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hashed out the 10 stipulations set forth," Scyphers said. "I had some 
questions regarding each and every one of them, and we seemed to (reach) 
agreement on them." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "There was a lot of gray area, and I wanted to hash out the gray 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, who claimed he lost 15 pounds and had trouble sleeping during the 2 
1/2-month ordeal, said he is still bitter about the turn of events, despite his 
reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think everything is peachy keen," Scyphers said. "We need to move on, 
yes, but sometimes it's not that easy to put things behind you." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers was suspended as coach May 3, after police and the school district 
began investigating allegations of financial and disciplinary improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "the block," Scyphers admitted to improperly accepting three payments, 
totaling $2,000, from an adult baseball organization for the use of the Simi 
Valley High field, violating district policy. Scyphers used part of the money 
to pay his assistants without the knowledge of the district, a Southern Section 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers was cleared by the Ventura County district attorney of criminal 
wrongdoing on June 8. His coaching suspension was lifted the following day. 
However, because all coaches in the district are on one-year contracts, 
Scyphers needed approval to return. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Jeff Michael, who will be a senior, said players were never 
certain that the board would approve Scyphers' return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pretty concerned," he said. "We were just hoping the board members 
would see it as it is and have him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Kavanagh, the father of catcher Brian Kavanagh, said he is glad Scyphers 
would be back for his son's senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy it's over and now we can get back to baseball," he said. "Now the 
boys that are still on the team can get together and get on with things. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son enjoys playing for him and he respects him, and I guess that's all 
that matters."

CANYONS STADIUM SHAKES OFF DAMAGE, REPAIRS EXPECTED BY FOOTBALL SEASON 
</P>

<P>
 College of the Canyons' football and track stadium, which suffered extensive 
damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake, is expected to be repaired in time for the 
high school football season in September. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news for Canyon, Hart and Saugus highs, whose football teams 
traditionally play several games each season at the college. Until last month, 
however, the schools figured they might be forced to play at alternate sites 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Olmstead, business manager at Canyons, said Wednesday that he expects 
repair work to be completed by late August. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to work out some details about when the next stages (of 
construction) will begin, but if we get started within the next couple of 
weeks, we should be OK," Olmstead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair costs, expected to total approximately $505,000, can be broken down 
into four categories: Laying the foundation for the track ($138,100), 
resurfacing and re-striping the track and infield runways ($264,000), repairing 
subsurface damage to the stadium ($91,000) and paying the project manager 
($12,000). 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency will pay for 90% of the costs. Canyons 
will pay 2.5%, or $12,625. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation work, which involved removing the damaged track and laying a 
three-inch layer of asphalt as a base for the new track, was completed June 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The asphalt requires three to four weeks to cure before the new track can be 
laid. Installation of the track, which also takes three to four weeks, consists 
of pouring the rubberized track and infield runways, letting them cure and 
re-striping the track. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be two alterations to the new track. The distance for one lap will 
be shortened from 440 yards to the standard 400 meters and the steeplechase 
water jump will be moved from the outside to the inside of the second turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for repair work on subsurface stadium damage to take place in 
conjunction with the track resurfacing, Olmstead said. 
</P>
<P>
 No track and field meets were held at the stadium last spring because of 
damage to the track. The track facilities normally are used by colleges and 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsurface repair involves drilling holes through the cement at the base of 
the stadium foundation and pouring in a cement-type solution to fill gaps that 
formed between the foundation and soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "All (of the work should start) within the next couple of weeks," Olmstead 
said.

TRACK AND FIELD / JOHN ORTEGA; FULLY HEELED, HAAG TURNS TO JUNIOR OLYMPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bruised heel, limiting Danny Haag's training during much of his senior 
season at Granada Hills High, turned out to be a blessing in disguise as he 
gears up for the USA Track & Field Junior Olympic Championships this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Haag, who graduated from Granada Hills last month, will compete in three 
events in the national meet after winning the 110-meter high hurdles (14.4 
seconds) and finishing second in the long jump (22 feet 5 3/4 inches) in the 
young men's division of the Region 15 championship at Cal State Long Beach over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three finishers in each event advanced to the national championship, 
to be held July 26-31 at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Haag already had qualified in the decathlon by winning last month's Region 15 
championship with a personal best of 6,476 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm mostly going to be concentrating on the decathlon back there," Haag said. 
"I want to do well in the hurdles and the long jump, but the decathlon is going 
to be my main focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Haag finished fourth in the long jump and seventh in the 110 highs in last 
month's State championships, although he was not 100% fit because of the injury 
he suffered in April. It limited his training for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Haag returned from the injury in early June, and says he is in the best shape 
of his life after training hard under Allan Hanckel, a decathlete of note in 
the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Of greater importance, he feels mentally fresh at a stage of the year when 
many high school athletes are feeling the effects of a long track season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stronger and faster than I've ever been in workouts, so I'm hoping for a 
good performance in Florida," Haag said. "I think 7,000 points is definitely 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 A 7,000-point total would move Haag into 10th on the all-time national high 
school list and break the state high school record of 6,970 set by Tom Richards 
of Santa Barbara San Marcos High in 1988. Haag is matter-of-fact when 
explaining why he figures he can eclipse the mark.  
</P>
<P>
 "I only had a personal best in one event when I scored 6,476 and a couple of 
the other events were pretty bad," he said. "So if I don't do bad in any one 
event and have a couple of good events, I should be right there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky call: Jamaal Chase, a recent graduate of Quartz Hill High, won the young 
men's long jump and triple jump in the Region 15 meet with marks of 23-1 and 
49-3, but a pair of sympathetic officials appeared to have contributed to his 
long jump victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, who fouled on his first two attempts, appeared to have fouled on his 
third jump as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A third foul would have eliminated him because he would not have been among 
the top eight competitors after three rounds. But officials ruled it a fair 
jump after taking several seconds to make a decision, according to a source at 
the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision produced boos from several spectators, who apparently felt the 
officials took pity on Chase because he fouled out of the long jump finals in 
the State championships last month. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia question: Name the local high school track coach who tied for second in 
the pole vault in the 1958 State high school championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Hint: He later set a world indoor record for the Southern California Striders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 History lesson: Did you know that the 880-yard relay was the only relay race 
contested in the State high school championships from 1915-67? 
</P>
<P>
 When the 880 relay was dropped in 1968, it was replaced by the 440-yard and 
mile relays, which were replaced by the 400- and 1,600-meter events in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fast times ahead: If this year's results are any indication, the boys' 3,200 
meters and the girls' 300-meter low hurdles could be the events stocked with 
the region's best overall talent in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the top 10 performers on this year's region regional list in the 
3,200 were juniors, led by Palmdale's Antonio Arce (9 minutes 3.19 seconds), 
Thousand Oaks' Jeff Fischer (9:10.42) and Camarillo's Eleazar Hernandez 
(9:10.96). 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura's Cathy Prater, who moved to sixth on the all-time regional list in the 
300 lows with a time of 43.62, graduated in June, but Buena sophomore Stacy 
Hebert (44.39), Rio Mesa junior Andrea Wasden (44.5), Nordhoff freshman Bridie 
Hatch (44.89) and Rio Mesa junior Susyn Heidenrich (45.61) are expected to 
return. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Back to the diamond: Kate Stoll would appear to have a promising future in the 
javelin after finishing second for College of the Canyons in the State junior 
college championships in May, but she intends to focus her attention on 
softball for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoll, a catcher on Canyons' softball team and a guard on the Cougars' 
basketball team during the 1991-93 school years, took up the javelin this 
season because she wanted to stay in shape while she finished work on her 
Associate of Arts degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Her only goal entering the season was to "have fun and stay in shape," yet she 
progressed quickly enough to win the Western State Conference title with a 
throw of 131-9 and improved that mark to 139-10 in the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expected to finish second in the State championships," Stoll said. 
"Overwhelmed would be the right word to describe my feelings about the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her success, Stoll hopes to play softball at either Fresno State, San 
Diego State or Cal State Fullerton for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play (at the NCAA Division I level in) softball," Stoll said. "If 
there's a chance for me to throw the javelin after my college softball days are 
over, maybe I will, but for now, softball is my sport." 
</P>

 Trivia answer: Taft Coach Mel Hein Jr. cleared 13-6 1/2 for Pasadena in the 
1958 State meet to tie for second with Don Schaeffer of Oakland and Henry 
Aguirre of Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Hein cleared a world indoor record of 16-5 3/4 in the 1965 San Francisco 
Examiner Games.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; RATHMAN SET TO SIGN FOR TWO YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders and fullback Tom Rathman have agreed on the parameters of a 
two-year, $1.2-million deal to bring the former San Francisco 49er to Los 
Angeles. Rathman and his agent, Marvin Demoff, will be at Raider camp in Oxnard 
today to try to wrap up the details. 
</P>
<P>
 Rathman, an unrestricted free agent, decided about a week ago that playing in 
Los Angeles was his first choice. Rathman is an eight-year veteran, having 
spent all eight seasons in San Francisco. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 After walking away from football in 1991, defensive end Scott Davis returned 
to the Raiders, looking as if he had never left during practice at the team's 
training camp in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a 6-foot-7, 280-pound former No. 1 draft choice from Illinois, 
surprised the Raiders when he retired to go into business three years ago when 
many NFL experts regarded him among the league's top young defenders.

 The Raiders said goodby to veteran wide receiver Willie Gault, terminating his 
contract. Kevin Smith, who made the switch from fullback to tight end, wore 
Gault's No. 83 in practice Thursday. . . . The Raiders released safety Donovan 
Gallatin, from UCLA, and free-agent linebacker Darrick Brownlow, then signed 
wide receiver Mike Alexander, who played with them three seasons ago before 
moving on to Buffalo, San Francisco and Calgary of the CFL. Also signed were 
draft choices Calvin Jones, a running back from Nebraska, and Austin Robbins, a 
defensive tackle from North Carolina. LONNIE WHITE

 With 10 days left in the Tour de France, the race for the title appears to be 
over. Spain's Miguel Indurain has a lead of nearly five minutes and his primary 
rival has all but conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 The 175 remaining riders enjoyed their only day off in this year's race 
Thursday. They were gathering their strength for today's 12th stage of 127 
miles, with two more major climbs, the famous Tourmalet (6,937 feet) and Luz 
Ardidan (5,625 feet). 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the riders used the rest day to recover from the first mountain stage 
that ended with many riders far behind. Among them was Switzerland's Tony 
Rominger, who was expected to be the only real challenger in this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the individual time trial on Monday and Wednesday's mountain, Rominger 
lost more than four minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's finished for me," Rominger told the French sports daily L'Equipe. "Of 
course. I am going to continue, but I can't compete with (Indurain)." 
Jurisprudence  
</P>
<P>
 Top Rank of Louisiana has received stronger support from a state judge in its 
effort to move the Minnesota Timberwolves to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Rank and the state of Louisiana won a preliminary injunction from Judge 
Bernadette Johnson that forbids the NBA from publishing its 1994-95 schedule. 
Publishing the schedule would, in effect, prevent the Timberwolves' sale.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the NBA said that it would publish the schedule, noting that a 
federal judge in Minneapolis has already ordered the Louisiana court to halt 
all proceedings.

 With rookie Wayne Gandy still unsigned, Coach Chuck Knox might be looking for 
volunteers at left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy is projected as the starter there, a key position because the tackle 
will protect oft-injured quarterback Chris Miller's blind side. Gandy's quick 
development is a must if he's going to start, and it appears he could be a 
contract holdout during at least part of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible replacement candidates are guards Leo Goeas and Jeff Pahukoa, who 
have both played some tackle, and free-agent acquisitions Clarence Jones and 
Bill Schultz. MIKE REILLEY

 Signs of moderating economic growth drove Treasury bond yields sharply lower 
Thursday, which in turn sent stock prices soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 A broad advance by the dollar against key foreign currencies also aided both 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond tumbled to 7.53% from Wednesday's 
7.68%, in a powerful rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates fell across the board, with the yield on one-year T-bills 
slumping to 5.33% from 5.48% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to bonds' gains, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 34.97 points 
to 3,739.25, as winners topped losers by 16 to 6 on the Big Board. Trading was 
the busiest since mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said news of weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales in June, and a 
pickup in weekly unemployment claims, increased some investors' conviction that 
economic growth is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market has been starved for such news, because bond investors have 
feared that fast growth will drive up inflation and force the Federal Reserve 
Board to boost short-term interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported Thursday that retail sales rose a 
smaller-than-expected 0.6% in June. Moreover, the report showed that sales 
dropped a revised 0.4% in May -- double the earlier 0.2% estimate -- and a full 
1% in April. Thus, the June rebound was even less significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the number of first-time 
claims for state unemployment benefits jumped a larger-than-expected 19,000 
last week, the biggest increase in two months and another potential sign of a 
slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's been holding the market down has been fear of rising rates and the 
consequences of the weak dollar," said Bob Stovall, president of Stovall/21st 
Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you remove those two fears, for a day anyhow, the market's going to 
bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 Worries about the battered dollar were lessened Thursday as it rallied 
sharply, after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the Clinton Administration 
wants a strong currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's comments refueled a rebound in the dollar that had begun Wednesday. 
The dollar jumped to close at 1.555 German marks and 98.60 Japanese yen in New 
York, up from Wednesday's 1.539 marks and 98.30 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gains in bonds, the dollar and stocks, however, many analysts were 
cautious. They noted that all three markets rallied in part because of 
"short-covering" by traders who had bet that the recent deep decline in the 
markets would continue. 
</P>
<P>
 When a trader sells short, he sells a borrowed security in the hopes of 
replacing it later at a lower price. But if markets begin to rise, the trader 
may be compelled to rush in and buy the security to cover his position, to 
avoid large losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Such short-covering when markets turn upward can bolster rallies, but they 
aren't long-lasting unless true investors begin to buy as well, analysts note. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the bond market, in particular, was ripe for a short-covering 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Leading Dow stocks included AT&T, up 1 1/8 to 54 1/2; IBM, up 1 1/2 to 58 
1/4; United Technologies, up 1 3/8 to 66 1/8; and 3M, up 1 to 51 5/8;  
</P>
<P>
 * Takeover announcements helped boost the market. Medical supplies maker 
Kendall International jumped 3 to 54 after Tyco International said it would buy 
Kendall for $1.4 billion. Tyco lost 1 3/4 to 45 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, QVC Network gained 1 7/16 to 43 7/16, continuing to rise in response to 
Comcast's takeover offer. Comcast shares added 1/2 to 15 5/8 after diving 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless communications giant Nextel Communication's takeover offer for 
OneComm sent the latter's stock up 8 1/4 to 28 1/2, and also boosted stocks of 
other wireless firms, including Dial Page, up 5 3/4 to 30 3/4; Pittencrief, up 
2 3/8 to 14 3/8; and Qualcomm, up 3 to 19 1/2. Nextel shares eased 5/8 to 29 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lumber and paper stocks rallied on the back of strong earnings and improved 
industry fundamentals. Louisiana Pacific gained 2 to 31 1/4, Potlatch added 1 
1/8 to 39 1/4 and Weyerhaueser rose 1 1/8 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks rallied early in the day, continuing their recent rebound. 
But some late announcements quashed the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer networker Cisco Systems told analysts that it may face difficulty 
meeting analysts' expectations in the fiscal fourth quarter ending July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 That sent Cisco down 4 1/4 to 19 3/4 and also hurt other networking stocks, 
including Wellfleet Communications, down 1 1/8 to 19 7/8; Newbridge Networks, 
down 3 3/8 to 39 3/4; and Cabletron Systems, down 5 1/4 to 105. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, computer retailer MicroAge plunged 7 3/4 to 10 after warning that its 
profit margins are shrinking as competition increases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, golfclub head maker Coastcast lost 1 5/8 to 23 3/4 
despite reporting that quarterly earnings nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index built on Wednesday's rally, jumping 45.1 
points to 3,050.4. But in Frankfurt the DAX index rose just 1.62 points to 
2,055.62. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo the Nikkei average gained 177.63 points to finish at 20,718.04. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City the Bolsa index climbed 17.91 points to 2,282.78. Market

DIGITAL TO SPEED PLAN TO CUT ITS STAFF BY 20,000; COMPUTERS: THE COMPANY SAYS 
IT WILL TAKE A $1.2-BILLION CHARGE AGAINST EARNINGS TO PAY FOR THAT AND PLANT 
CLOSINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Stung by continuing losses, Digital Equipment Corp. said Thursday that it is 
accelerating plans to eliminate 20,000 jobs and that it will take a 
$1.2-billion charge against earnings to pay for the staff cuts and extensive 
plant closings. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves represent a desperate effort by Chief Executive Robert B. Palmer to 
restore investor confidence in the company, which has been battered by $4 
billion in losses over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, analysts said the moves do little to address the formidable technical 
and strategic challenges facing the nation's third-largest computer company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think shareholders are satisfied with just cutting," said analyst 
David Wu of S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. "They want to understand how Mr. 
Palmer is going to make this company grow again." 
</P>
<P>
 Digital's stock fell $1.25 to $20.125 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer also announced that he has changed Digital's management structure, 
which he described as mired in talks and memos, blurry lines of responsibility 
and slow decision making. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marketplace is too Darwinian to allow that amount of discussion," Palmer 
told reporters in a conference call. "We will be more agile and we will be more 
decisive." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said he has created nine business units, three of which will report 
directly to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've put in place an accounting mechanism to show who's really sinking and 
swimming," said Bill Bluestein, analyst with Forrester Research Inc. in 
Cambridge.  
</P>
<P>
 Palmer was hired in late 1992 to rescue Digital, the most successful designer 
of minicomputers, after it began to decline under co-founder Kenneth Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer implemented a radical reorganization plan that included two rounds of 
staff cuts, but the company has had just one profitable quarter during his 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure on the company intensified in April, when Digital reported a 
$183-million loss for its fiscal third quarter, which ended in March. That 
figure was far more than investors had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Some top executives were fired, and Palmer said then that the company's ideal 
size would be 65,000 employees. There were between 85,000 and 92,000 at the 
time, and Palmer said Digital would reduce its staffing over two years. On 
Thursday, however, he said the reductions would occur in one year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, Digital will reduce its office and factory space by 10 
million square feet to 22 million square feet -- less than half what it had at 
its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the changes, the company said, it will take a $1.2-billion charge 
against earnings for its fourth quarter, which ended July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said the new measures will cut annual expenses by $1.8 billion and put 
Digital's operations in the black by the end of the calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital grew into a powerhouse on the strength of its minicomputers and other 
large computer systems. But the company failed to appreciate the significance 
of personal computers, which are now used for many of the functions once 
performed by Digital systems. The company was also late in developing its own 
version of an advanced computer design known as RISC.

LITTON SETTLES FRAUD SUIT FOR $82 MILLION; DEFENSE: CONTRACTOR AGREES TO 
RESOLVE ALLEGATIONS OF OVERCHARGING. WHISTLE-BLOWER IS NOT ALIVE TO SEE 
HISTORIC SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the largest whistle-blower settlements in history, Beverly 
Hills-based Litton Industries agreed Thursday to pay $82 million to resolve 
allegations it overcharged the government for computer work on defense 
contracts, vindicating a former employee who did not live to see his courage 
bear fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 More than six years ago, James Carton, a Litton data systems analyst, sued the 
defense conglomerate, alleging that the company used illegal accounting 
techniques to make the Pentagon pick up the tab for data-processing costs that 
should have been borne by commercial customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carton sued under the Federal False Claims Act, which permits a private party 
to sue on behalf of the government and receive from 15% to 25% of the proceeds 
if the suit is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thursday's settlement, Carton's widow, Anita -- who runs a Simi Valley 
hair salon -- could garner up to $20 million. Carton himself died of a heart 
attack in December during a Caribbean cruise celebrating the couple's 25th 
wedding anniversary. He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a really tragic aspect of this case," said Howard Daniels, chief of 
the U.S. attorney's civil fraud section in Los Angeles. "He was really a good 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Litton said it settled without any admission of wrongdoing or 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
 "A decision to settle is a difficult choice when you believe your position is 
correct," Chairman Alton J. Brann said. "This decision was made in recognition 
of the potentially significant amount at risk." The company said its potential 
liability for damages and penalties could have totaled as much as $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Carton came to the federal courthouse in Downtown Los Angeles as 
attorneys put the final touches on the settlement Thursday. Through her lawyer, 
Janet Goldstein, she said only that she was pleased with the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement ended "the most exhaustively litigated case I've been involved 
in during my 20 years as a lawyer," Daniels said, noting that there were 76 
volumes of legal pleadings, two large roomfuls of documents and two file 
cabinets of correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said he thought the settlement, the third-largest of its kind, was a 
particularly important one. "This was an extraordinarily subtle and 
sophisticated scheme," he said. "We wanted to get the message out to the 
defense industry that we could tackle cases of this magnitude and stay with 
them to the bitter end." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past four years the U.S. attorney's civil fraud unit has recovered 
$150 million for taxpayers, Daniels said. "That dwarfs the recoveries of any 
other U.S. attorney's office that I'm aware of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carton's suit was originally filed under seal in April, 1988. Several 
government agencies then launched investigations, and in March, 1989, the 
Justice Department unsealed the case and announced it would take it over in 
conjunction with Carton's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleged that Litton -- apparently in an attempt to attract more 
commercial computer customers -- did not charge commercial clients for using 
the company's computer memory banks beyond a certain "cap" level. There were no 
such "caps" for government clients, the suit said, so the government ended up 
paying the excess overhead for commercial customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1989 interview, Carton said he discovered the problem when he was asked 
as technical director of Litton's Woodland Hills division to do a profitability 
study of the company's computing business. He said he confronted his superiors 
with his findings that the government was being overcharged but got no 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was ferociously fought. To defend itself, Litton employed three 
highly skilled law firms, headed by Los Angeles' Munger, Tolles & Olson. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers challenged the constitutionality of the federal whistle-blower law 
under which the suit was filed. After that move failed, Litton raised numerous 
other defenses, including a challenge to the government's contention that 
Litton's accounting system was illegal.  
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1992, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer rejected that bid, 
ruling that Litton's cost accounting system was illegal under federal 
procurement laws. On Thursday, Litton maintained that its system lowered costs 
to all customers, including the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the company contended that the case should have ended with 
Carton's death. A Florida federal appeals court had rejected a similar 
contention in another whistle-blower suit, and the issue was pending here when 
settlement talks grew serious in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne played a key role in forging the 
settlement, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton said Thursday that it has agreed to pay the Cartons' lawyers $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 After consulting with that law firm -- Phillips, Cohen & Goldstein of West Los 
Angeles -- Daniels will make a recommendation to Justice Department officials 
on how much Anita Carton should collect. In a pleading filed earlier in the 
case, Daniels said Jim Carton would have been the key witness if the case had 
gone to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend said the burden of being a whistle-blower had taken its toll on 
Carton. 
</P>
<P>
 Emil Stache, a whistle-blower in another case, said in a court declaration 
that Carton had told him he "suffered from a great deal of anxiety and 
nervousness and that the case was taking a 'great emotional toll' on him."

RETAILING GIANT IS WAITING IN WINGS; MACY OKS DEAL WITH FEDERATED

<P>
 The board of R.H. Macy & Co. on Thursday formally approved in principle an 
agreement to merge with Federated Department Stores Inc., a move that would 
create a retailing powerhouse that could give consumers greater shopping 
choices and lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal could also lead to the loss of hundreds of jobs in California as 
some administrative positions are eliminated and poorly performing stores are 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger could shake up the California retailing market by boosting 
competition and bolstering the financial clout of troubled Macy, which operates 
Bullock's stores. It would alsomake it easier for Federated to carry out its 
previously announced plan to establish its Bloomingdale's stores in California 
by giving Federated access to Macy's distribution network and store sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's merchandise-buying units in New York and San Francisco could experience 
some job cuts as the merged company eliminated some office workers from 
overlapping business operations. Some industry analysts said at least several 
thousand jobs could be lost in the consolidation -- most of them middle 
management, purchasing, computer and clerical operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies released no details on the proposed structure of a combined 
company and would not comment on store plans or possible layoffs. However, 
industry analysts and local retail observers say the new company would probably 
shut down some poorly performing stores in Macy's I. Magnin chain, which 
operates 11 stores and employs 1,850 people in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement caps weeks of negotiations between Macy and Federated 
executives. By accepting the deal, Macy ended six months of opposition to 
Federated's overtures. New York-based Macy is reorganizing under Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said they expect to file a joint reorganization plan for Macy by 
Aug. 1, after a definitive merger agreement is reached and approved by their 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative agreement, Macy's creditors would be repaid with $4.1 
billion in cash, debt and stock in the combined company. Macy would then emerge 
from bankruptcy proceedings in January, after three years under Chapter 11 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are tremendously pleased and gratified by Macy's action, and we are 
excited by the prospects of a combined Macy's and Federated retail operation," 
Federated Chairman Allen I. Questrom said in a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the support and hard work of our 50,000 associates, the turnaround of 
Macy's is nearing completion," Macy Chairman Myron E. Ullman III said in the 
joint statement. "I am confident that the merger with Federated, as it is now 
proposed, will lead to the creation of one of the most vibrant companies in 
retailing." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Ullman would become deputy chairman of the merged company 
and Questrom would serve as chairman. In addition, four members of Macy's 
current board -- including Ullman -- would join the 12-member Federated board. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger could occur shortly after a bankruptcy judge approves a 
reorganization plan. All of Macy's creditor groups now support the merger. The 
company's bondholders reached agreement with Federated on Wednesday night, and 
court approval of the plan is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would give Federated a much desired foothold in California. In 
addition to Bloomingdale's, Federated operates chains such as Burdine's and 
Lazarus, but it has no stores in California.  
</P>
<P>
 Macy operates 43 of its 111 Bullock's and Macy stores in California. The 
merged company would have more than 300 department stores and annual revenue 
exceeding $13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Macy, the deal would allow it to emerge from bankruptcy in sounder 
financial shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "A merger allows Macy to reduce its costs because there will be a 
consolidation," said Mark Levin, a senior analyst at Beverly Hills-based Dabney 
Resnick & Co., an investment bank that handles distressed securities. "Questrom 
has done a great job at Federated, and he can help accelerate the recovery 
process for Macy." 
</P>
<P>
 If the merger is approved, larger retailers in California will face a new 
level of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be very intense," said Jack Kyser, senior economist at the Economic 
Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. "A merger would make it tough for the 
Broadway Stores and for the Robinsons-May chain. It's bad news for people in 
the retail business, but it's good news for consumers because shoppers will 
have more options." 
</P>
<P>
 The combined retailer would have more buying clout, enabling it to acquire 
merchandise more cheaply and turn up the pressure on California competitors by 
eventually passing on some savings to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "While some people will lose their jobs, millions of consumers will benefit 
because there will be a greater variety of stores and more affordable pricing," 
said Kurt Barnard, a New York-based retail economist. "This deal will make all 
Macy and Federated department stores more competitive with discount chains." 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies hope to outline their plans for a Macy recovery in a 
statement that would be released within 60 days of the approval of the 
reorganization plan. The statement would detail the structure and operating 
plans of the combined company, as well as adding details on the consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger could be delayed by antitrust questions. Macy and Federated compete 
in many markets in the Northeast and South. Federal and state officials have 
said they will determine whether the proposed merger violates antitrust laws. *

UNITED'S NEW CHIEF TRIES TO CALM TROOPS; AIRLINES: GREENWALD VISITS L.A. ON THE 
HEELS OF EMPLOYEE BUYOUT. HE ENCOUNTERS BOTH ENTHUSIASM AND SKEPTICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Two days after United Airlines parent UAL Corp. became the nation's largest 
employee-controlled company, new UAL Chairman Gerald Greenwald arrived at Los 
Angeles International Airport on Thursday to meet and talk with his workers. 
They shook his hand, called him "partner" and praised his approachable manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saved a whole lot of jobs," said Stan Macdonneil, 52, a ground crew 
worker. "We are going to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 But after Greenwald completed his 3 1/2-hour visit of United's sprawling Los 
Angeles operation -- part of a nationwide tour of major company facilities -- 
many employees remained concerned about the risks and uncertainties they face 
in the unfamiliar world of employee ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan approved by UAL shareholders Tuesday, workers are taking nearly 
$5 billion in wage and work-rule concessions in exchange for 55% ownership of 
the nation's second-largest airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Employee ownership has failed to save several other carriers, and today's 
cutthroat airline environment poses a substantial challenge to United and its 
employees, who now have more to lose if the carrier stumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of skeptical," said Chris Lemelle, a 27-year-old United aircraft 
mechanic who had opposed the buyout. "For this to work, you have to have a lot 
of communication between employees and a lot more dedication. We don't have 
that here. It's going to take some more time to win me over." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald faced a variety of questions from ticket agents, department 
managers, pilots, baggage handlers and other employees. United employs about 
75,000 people, including approximately 6,000 in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Chrysler Corp. executive, who was handpicked by United's pilots and 
machinists unions, talked about giving workers more authority, cutting layers 
of management and encouraging risk taking. He asked employees what they thought 
about increasing the cargo business or discussing safety issues in company 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 He also announced that United had selected John A. Edwardson, a former airline 
executive who is currently chief financial officer at Chicago-based Ameritech 
Corp., to serve as president. Former President John Pope and Chairman Stephen 
Wolf resigned Tuesday when the buyout was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald also revealed a few more details about the United Shuttle, a new 
low-fare airline that Chicago-based UAL is forming to compete against low-cost 
carriers such as Southwest Airlines. Los Angeles will play a major role for 
United Shuttle, which will begin service Oct. 1 in several West Coast markets, 
including from Los Angeles to cities such as Sacramento, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new chairman said the company will also meet next week with negotiators 
for its 17,000-member flight attendants union, which has refused to join the 
employee buyout because of the company's plan to expand overseas bases using 
foreign flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for the most part, Greenwald's statements and responses Thursday were 
short on detail, and he answered "I don't know" to many questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just ask for your patience," he told about 100 mechanics and other ground 
crew workers in an employee lounge. "I don't expect you to believe everything 
I've said this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of specifics, many employees appeared enthusiastic about the 
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking a positive step toward the future," said Joe Martinez, a 
38-year-old payroll administrator. "When you are in charge, you take more pride 
in what you do. The stakes are higher for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Flight attendant Kyla Schneider, 32, said employee ownership will help boost 
morale. "It's very disconcerting when there are so many complaints about the 
company you are working for," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many see employee control as the only way to avoid the fate of some other 
airlines that have laid off thousands of workers or closed entirely amid a deep 
industry slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen other airlines fail. We have seen all the turmoil," said Charles 
Browden, 29, who fuels and unloads planes. "We are glad this came up before it 
happens to us."

FCC CLAIMS BIG DROP IN CABLE SUBSCRIBER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Federal Communications Commission survey shows that cable television 
rates in the nation's 25 largest cities have fallen 8.49% since August, leading 
agency Chairman Reed Hundt to declare, "Cable hyper-inflation is dead and 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC said its survey, which examined 43 cable systems in Los Angeles, San 
Diego, San Francisco and 22 other cities, found rates declined from an average 
of $25.17 a month to $23.50 as a result of new and controversial agency 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the study, which comes almost five months after the FCC ordered a 7% cut 
in cable rates on top of an earlier rollback that partially backfired, is 
unlikely to settle the dispute over the direction of cable charges. That's 
because the survey looked only at systems in large cities and does not 
represent a true cross-section of the U.S. cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Many consumer groups had complained that after years of stiff fee increases 
and poor service, cable operators were still increasing rates by circumventing 
FCC regulations. Cable companies had allegedly changed their definitions of 
basic service and sharply increased charges for some pay services to counteract 
the mandatory cuts in basic service rates. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the second round of regulations, which cover pricing of equipment -- 
converters and remote controls -- as well as cable programming other than 
pay-per-view and premium channels, appears to have slowed efforts to 
reconfigure basic cable service, said Kathleen Wallman, deputy chief of the 
Cable Services Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware of much activity in that regard anymore," Wallman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable operators, meanwhile, say the rate rollbacks, which the FCC predicted 
would save consumers $3 billion a year, are complicating the industry's 
ambitious plans to spend billions of dollars to upgrade their systems with 
fiber-optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the cable industry has been saying all along, and as this report confirms, 
these regulations have teeth," Decker Anstrom, president of the National Cable 
Television Assn., said in a statement Thursday. "They have reduced rates and 
have taken a real bite out of cable revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 FCC Chairman Hundt, who praised cable operators for their "good-faith effort 
to comply with the regulations," said in an interview that it is unlikely 
consumers will see further cable rate reductions in the near future. "There 
will be annual inflation increases" until the industry faces greater 
competition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC calculated that if the industry had continued to increase rates at an 
annual pre-regulation rate of nearly 6%, subscribers' average monthly bills 
would have been $26.59, rather than $23.50. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we can tell, all American cable subscribers have benefited to some 
degree," Hundt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the FCC's rules, however, not all systems are regulated in the same way. 
Small operators and those with low monthly rates are not required to move their 
rates down to the new regulated levels. Other systems can charge higher rates 
if they can demonstrate that they face unusual business costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a small number of systems surveyed are unregulated, either 
because they face effective competition from another program provider or 
because the municipality has not received FCC certification to administer the 
rate rules and no consumer complaint over rates has been filed with the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rates on unregulated systems increased only 3.53% on average since 
August, one system -- Insight Cablevision of Phoenix -- boosted its bargain 
$3.95-a-month basic cable rate to $9.15, a 132% jump. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Century Cable's rates actually rose 7.76% since August, from 
$25.40 to $27.37. In San Diego, they fell 8.98% on Cox Cable systems and 5.48% 
on Time Warner systems.

THE LINKED PATHS OF MACY AND FEDERATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some important events leading up to the merger of R.H. Macy & Co. and 
Federated Department Stores Inc. The histories of Macy and Federated have been 
intertwined in recent years as the companies have coped with financial strife 
and takeover bids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 16, 1986: Macy board, under Chairman Edward Finkelstein, approves a 
$3.58-billion debt-financed takeover from top management, converting Macy into 
a privately held company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 26, 1987: Macy loses only $13.8 million in its first year as a private 
company, compared to a projected $62.5-million loss, raising optimism that it 
will succeed as a privately held company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 29, 1988: Macy offers $6.1 billion for Federated Department Stores, 
prompting a bidding war with Campeau Corp. of Canada, which some time earlier 
had launched a takeover bid for Federated. Federated controls Bullock's and I. 
Magnin, with Allen I. Questrom (current Federated chief) serving as chairman of 
Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 1, 1988: Campeau wins Federated in a $6.6-billion compromise that 
allows Macy to buy Federated's Bullock's and I. Magnin divisions for $1.1 
billion, substantially increasing Macy's debt load.  
</P>
<P>
 * July 31, 1988: With sales sluggish, Macy loses $188 million for the fiscal 
year. Concerns grow about the company's ability to handle its debt, which now 
exceeds $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 31, 1989: Macy posts a $53.6-million loss for the 1989 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 19, 1990: Macy's losses triple to $215.3 million for the 1990 fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 1, 1991: Macy posts loss of $150.2 million for the 1991 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 17, 1991: Macy posts first-quarter loss of $155.4 million, triple the 
loss recorded the previous first quarter, because of weak sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 27, 1992: Macy files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Documents 
reveal that the company has nearly depleted its cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 1, 1993: Myron E. Ullman III becomes chairman and chief executive of 
Macy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 2, 1994: Federated reveals that it has bought half of the Macy debt 
held by Prudential Insurance Co., giving Federated a seat at the bargaining 
table in Macy's Chapter 11 reorganization. Federated also publicly raises the 
idea of a merger with Macy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 3, 1994: Macy and Federated open discussions on Federated's interest in 
a merger. Macy indicates that it would prefer to remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 1, 1994: Representatives of Federated present a detailed merger plan to 
Macy's board. Many of Macy's major creditors now back the Federated proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 8, 1994: Pressured by creditors, Macy's board decides to open merger 
negotiations with Federated. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 14, 1994: Macy board agrees in principal to a merger with Federated.

 Retail Sales Rise: The U.S. Commerce Department said sales staged a recovery 
in June, rising 0.6%, after dropping for two months.The increase was about what 
economists had predicted. The turnaround was led by durable goods, particularly 
cars and building materials. Retail sales had dropped a revised 0.4% in May -- 
double a month-old 0.2% estimate -- and 1% in April. Those figures were taken 
as evidence that the rapid economic growth the nation experienced in late 1993 
has slowed to a more moderate pace.

 IDB Communications in Acquisition Talks: Sources confirmed that five potential 
suitors are showing interest in acquiring the Culver City company, which 
provides long-distance phone services, radio and TV transmissions and mobile 
satellite communications. IDB did confirm that one suitor is long-distance firm 
LDDS Communications, but it said no agreement has been reached and "no 
assurances can be given that any transaction will occur, nor the price at which 
it might occur." Interest in IDB apparently picked up after its stock plunged 
following an accounting dispute in May in which auditors Deloitte & Touche 
resigned.

part of a larger plan to build more cars in the United States, according to a 
published report. The Dayton Daily News, quoting unnamed sources, said Honda 
plans to add about 150,000 units of production capacity to the 130,000 units 
currently available at the factory. A spokesman for Honda declined to comment 
on the report.

built-in incentives for reducing surgical costs.Baxter said the accord marks 
the industry's first such agreement covering surgical supplies. It and other 
hospital suppliers are seeking ways to help customers cut expenses in response 
to public pressure to contain health care costs. Under the deal, Baxter and 
Duke set target costs for supplies for various surgical procedures.

 Former Salomon Trader Fined, Barred: Paul Mozer, who played a central role in 
a 1991 Treasury bond bidding scandal and pleaded guilty earlier this year to 
criminal charges, was fined and barred from the securities industry for life, 
regulators said. The penalties resolve a Securities and Exchange Commission 
civil investigation of Mozer, a former managing director of Salomon Bros. of 
New York. The complaint charged that Mozer improperly exercised stock options 
allowing him to sell 46,000 shares he owned in Salomon while he possessed 
important confidential information about the company.

 Golden West Corp. Earnings Off 11%: The Oakland-based parent of World Savings 
& Loan Assn. posted second-quarter net income of $61.9 million, or 98 cents a 
share, down from $70.6 million, or $1.10 a share. Marion O. Sandler, chairman 
and chief executive of Golden West, said the results were affected by "a lower 
profit margin and a faster-than-normal increase in administrative expenses."

 U.S. Studios Fire Back in Britain: United International Pictures, the joint 
distribution arm of Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures and 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, has released a study to blunt recent criticism that major 
U.S. studios suck too much money out of the British economy, pay too little in 
taxes and don't contribute enough to the British film industry. The study by 
London Economics says critics have overstated film royalties sent to the United 
States by 300% and overstated UIP's British theatrical revenue by 1,400%. The 
study says taxes on royalties are consistent with British law.

CHRYSLER'S 2ND QUARTER REFLECTS BOOM IN SALES; AUTOS: EARNINGS OUTSTRIP 
ESTIMATES, BUT SHORTAGES LIMIT POTENTIAL FOR REST OF THE MODEL YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chrysler Corp., enjoying booming sales in its Jeep, minivan and passenger car 
lines, Thursday reported a record second-quarter profit of $956 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure topped Wall Street's most optimistic estimates. It compares to $685 
million earned in the equivalent period of 1993 and an all-time record 
quarterly profit of $983 million for the first three months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong consumer demand for Chrysler cars and trucks -- both in North America 
and around the world -- once again generated solid quarterly financial 
results," Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said in a statement. "Dealer 
inventories for many of our products -- including minivans, Dodge and Plymouth 
Neon, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Ram -- were in short supply for much of the 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's No. 3 car maker said the April-to-June performance, equal to 
profit of $2.35 a share on a fully diluted basis, was the best in the company's 
69-year history. It exceeded Wall Street's estimate of $2.26 a share and the 
$1.69-a-share profit of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-quarter revenue rose 19% to $13.1 billion, from $11 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter of '93, the auto maker registered a $110-million onetime 
gain from stock and asset sales, so the latest results were even more 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wall Street analysts said the improvement was not big enough to boost 
Chrysler's stock price. It slipped 75 cents to $49.375 a share in New York 
Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Chief Financial Officer Gary Valade, interviewed after the release of 
the earnings report, said the auto maker is reducing its forecast of 1994 U.S. 
auto industry sales to 15.6 million vehicles from 16 million because of the 
inventory shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still seem to have the ability to buy and the willingness to buy, but 
the availability is not there," Valade said. He said Chrysler had only a 45-day 
supply of cars and trucks at the end of June, down from 50 days in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers typically like to have 60 to 65 days' supply on hand throughout 
the year and higher inventories in the summer to make up for extended model 
changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Chrysler will probably see worse shortages in the next few 
months but that inventories should catch up by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a victim of a hot product and a hot market," J.P. Morgan auto analyst 
David Bradley said. "They're increasing production, but not as fast as demand 
is growing." 
</P>
<P>
 During the second quarter, Chrysler's worldwide sales rose almost 7% to 
702,802 vehicles.

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION FORESEES NO RECESSION; ECONOMY: UPBEAT MIDYEAR REPORT 
STICKS WITH EARLIER PREDICTIONS OF CONTINUED MODEST GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rapidly rising interest rates and the international collapse of the U.S. 
dollar will not lead to another recession, the Clinton Administration predicted 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials, in an upbeat midyear report on the state of the 
nation's economy, said the Administration will stick with its earlier 
predictions of continued modest growth throughout the remainder of President 
Clinton's term. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the White House did not attempt to break down its economic forecast 
by region, so offered no predictions about the outlook for areas of the country 
such as Southern California that are still struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said interest rate increases will dampen growth somewhat by 
1996 but not significantly, and that effect will be offset by strong job growth 
and increases in business investment. U.S. exports, which are now rising at 
double the rate of those of other industrial nations, will continue to boost 
the economy, largely because of America's improved international competitive 
position.  
</P>
<P>
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic 
Advisers, said the Administration still believes the economy will grow by 3% 
this year -- the same rate it predicted in its last official forecast in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration said it does not believe the economy can sustain its 3.4% 
first-half pace during the last six months of the year, but it also said it 
does not believe that the rapid rise in interest rates over the past few months 
will lead to big drops in employment or growth. Officials made only slight 
reductions in growth estimates, trimming the Administration forecast by 0.1% 
for each of the years 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House sought to use the mid-session budget and economic review as a 
forum to provide an 18-month "report card" on Clinton's handling of the 
economy.  
</P>
<P>
 A series of Administration officials, armed with full-color charts and graphs, 
each credited the Clinton economic plan of 1993 for bringing about the 
turnaround. Indeed, for an Administration sorely in need of good news, the 
economic figures seemed to provide welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1992 election hinged on one major issue, and that was the economy, so I'm 
here with charts to give you the report card," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
said at a White House briefing. "By any standard, this economy is doing well, 
and we're doing it with inflation under control."  
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, just back from an economic meeting in Naples, Italy, added that the 
U.S. economy is now growing faster than that of any other major industrial 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident of our forecast because the foundations for a period of 
moderate growth with low inflation and rising incomes are stronger now than 
they've been in a generation," said Tyson.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite fears on Wall Street of a surge in inflation -- fears that have put 
almost constant upward pressure on interest rates since February -- the 
Administration's new forecast calls for inflation at the consumer level to rise 
only gradually to 3.2% next year and to peak at 3.4% by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said they believe the best news, however, is on the 
job front. Since Clinton entered office, they said, 3.8 million jobs have been 
created. That puts him ahead of his campaign pledge to create 8 million jobs in 
four years.

TYCO IN $1.4-BILLION DEAL FOR KENDALL INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the largest mergers in the medical products industry, Tyco 
International Ltd. said Thursday that it will acquire Kendall International 
Inc., which makes Curad bandages and other disposable medical products, for 
$1.4 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by Exeter-based Tyco, which also manufactures a broad range of goods 
including fire-protection systems, gives it a firm position in the high-profit 
area of disposable medical products, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the definitive agreement, Tyco will issue Kendall shareholders $60.45 
worth of its stock for each Kendall share. 
</P>
<P>
 Following news of the deal, Tyco's stock fell and remained lower for the rest 
of the day. It closed at $45.625, off $1.75, while Kendall shares rose $3 to 
$54, both on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyco said the deal should close before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition "represents a quantum leap in (Tyco's) disposable medical 
business," Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our processes and equipment are virtually identical to those currently in use 
at Kendall, which should allow us to share manufacturing efficiencies and 
technology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kendall merger is a very important step in the strategy we developed 
several years ago to translate our manufacturing expertise in packaging into 
higher-margin products in the disposable medical products market." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the transaction will create a $1.2-billion business segment 
that will serve as a platform for future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski compared the proposed Kendall merger to Tyco's creation and 
expansion of its fire-protection business in the late 1980s. That operation now 
has revenue of about $1.6 billion a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyco said Richard Gilleland, Kendall's chairman and chief executive, will 
continue as Kendall's president and become a Tyco director. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilleland said in a statement, "This transaction provides a number of 
advantages and opportunities to Kendall, including Tyco's fast-growing 
$80-million medical disposables business." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same announcement, Tyco said its board has authorized the buyback of up 
to 2.9 million of its common shares, or about 10% of the shares to be issued in 
the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition of Mansfield, Mass.-based Kendall brings under Tyco's umbrella 
a broad line of home health care products. These include adhesive bandages and 
gauze pads, elastic supports, hosiery, diabetic products, durable medical 
equipment and incontinence care products, sold under the brand names Curad, 
Curity and Futuro.

FCC, STUNG BY COURT SETBACKS, RETREATS ON 2 RULINGS; COMMUNICATIONS: IT REVISES 
DECISIONS ON LOCAL PHONE COMPETITION AND WIRELESS PAGING LICENSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reeling from a string of embarrassing court setbacks, a humbled Federal 
Communications Commission voted Thursday to overhaul two key rulings affecting 
local telephone competition and an upcoming auction of licenses for new 
wireless paging services. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's five commissioners voted unanimously to give local telephone 
companies more leeway in providing facilities for rivals seeking to hook up 
independent phone networks. The vote was in response to a June 10 decision of 
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington that struck down a previous FCC rule 
that would have forced local carriers to give rivals space for hookups inside 
their own central offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came a day after commissioners, facing yet another court reversal, 
decided to scrap their controversial plan to give a free operating license to a 
company that had pioneered a new wireless communications technology called 
narrow-band personal communications services. Rivals of the company, Jackson, 
Miss.-based Mtel, are expected to bid millions of dollars for PCS licenses in 
auctions scheduled to begin in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC's difficulties are being closely watched in Washington's huge legal 
community because judicial review of the agency's decisions has often produced 
important administrative law cases that can affect other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of their cases go to the D.C. (federal) court circuit, which tends to be 
a leading" and closely followed legal forum, said Jeffrey Lubber, research 
director for the Administrative Conference of the United States, a federal 
agency that oversees the administrative procedures of other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has been trying to collect itself following a series of federal court 
reversals on issues ranging from agency fines to its regulation of 
long-distance telephone service. The Washington-based trade publication 
Communications Daily reported this week that the FCC has been reversed in 
"nearly all appeals in common carrier cases this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The setbacks largely stem from decisions made before the five-member 
commission took on its current makeup. The panel has received three Clinton 
Administration appointees since November, 1993.

 Signs of moderating economic growth drove Treasury bond yields sharply lower 
Thursday, which in turn sent stock prices soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 A broad advance by the dollar against key foreign currencies also aided both 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond tumbled to 7.53% from Wednesday's 
7.68%, in a powerful rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates fell across the board, with the yield on one-year T-bills 
slumping to 5.33% from 5.48% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to bonds' gains, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 34.97 points 
to 3,739.25, as winners topped losers by 16 to 6 on the Big Board. Trading was 
the busiest since mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said news of weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales in June, and a 
pickup in weekly unemployment claims, increased some investors' conviction that 
economic growth is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market has been starved for such news, because bond investors have 
feared that fast growth will drive up inflation and force the Federal Reserve 
Board to boost short-term interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported Thursday that retail sales rose a 
smaller-than-expected 0.6% in June. Moreover, the report showed that sales 
dropped a revised 0.4% in May -- double the earlier 0.2% estimate -- and a full 
1% in April. Thus, the June rebound was even less significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the number of first-time 
claims for state unemployment benefits jumped a larger-than-expected 19,000 
last week, the biggest increase in two months and another potential sign of a 
slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's been holding the market down has been fear of rising rates and the 
consequences of the weak dollar," said Bob Stovall, president of Stovall/21st 
Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you remove those two fears, for a day anyhow, the market's going to 
bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 Worries about the battered dollar were lessened Thursday as it rallied 
sharply, after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the Clinton Administration 
wants a strong currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's comments refueled a rebound in the dollar that had begun Wednesday. 
The dollar jumped to close at 1.555 German marks and 98.60 Japanese yen in New 
York, up from Wednesday's 1.539 marks and 98.30 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gains in bonds, the dollar and stocks, however, many analysts were 
cautious. They noted that all three markets rallied in part because of 
"short-covering" by traders who had bet that the recent deep decline in the 
markets would continue. 
</P>
<P>
 When a trader sells short, he sells a borrowed security in the hopes of 
replacing it later at a lower price. But if markets begin to rise, the trader 
may be compelled to rush in and buy the security to cover his position, to 
avoid large losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Such short-covering when markets turn upward can bolster rallies, but they 
aren't long-lasting unless true investors begin to buy as well, analysts note. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the bond market, in particular, was ripe for a short-covering 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Leading Dow stocks included AT&T, up 1 1/8 to 54 1/2; IBM, up 1 1/2 to 58 
1/4; United Technologies, up 1 3/8 to 66 1/8; and 3M, up 1 to 51 5/8;  
</P>
<P>
 * Takeover announcements helped boost the market. Medical supplies maker 
Kendall International jumped 3 to 54 after Tyco International said it would buy 
Kendall for $1.4 billion. Tyco lost 1 3/4 to 45 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, QVC Network gained 1 7/16 to 43 7/16, continuing to rise in response to 
Comcast's takeover offer. Comcast shares added 1/2 to 15 5/8 after diving 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless communications giant Nextel Communication's takeover offer for 
OneComm sent the latter's stock up 8 1/4 to 28 1/2, and also boosted stocks of 
other wireless firms, including Dial Page, up 5 3/4 to 30 3/4; Pittencrief, up 
2 3/8 to 14 3/8; and Qualcomm, up 3 to 19 1/2. Nextel shares eased 5/8 to 29 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lumber and paper stocks rallied on the back of strong earnings and improved 
industry fundamentals. Louisiana Pacific gained 2 to 31 1/4, Potlatch added 1 
1/8 to 39 1/4 and Weyerhaueser rose 1 1/8 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks rallied early in the day, continuing their recent rebound. 
But some late announcements quashed the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer networker Cisco Systems told analysts that it may face difficulty 
meeting analysts' expectations in the fiscal fourth quarter ending July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 That sent Cisco down 4 1/4 to 19 3/4 and also hurt other networking stocks, 
including Wellfleet Communications, down 1 1/8 to 19 7/8; Newbridge Networks, 
down 3 3/8 to 39 3/4; and Cabletron Systems, down 5 1/4 to 105. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, computer retailer MicroAge plunged 7 3/4 to 10 after warning that its 
profit margins are shrinking as competition increases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, golfclub head maker Coastcast lost 1 5/8 to 23 3/4 
despite reporting that quarterly earnings nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE-100 index built on Wednesday's rally, jumping 45.1 
points to 3,050.4. But in Frankfurt the DAX index rose just 1.62 points to 
2,055.62. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo the Nikkei average gained 177.63 points to finish at 20,718.04. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City the Bolsa index climbed 17.91 points to 2,282.78.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCES BREAKUP OF PRICE-FIXING CONSPIRACY ON FAX PAPER; 
ANTITRUST: THREE FIRMS AND FORMER COMPANY CHIEF AGREE TO PAY $6 MILLION TO 
SETTLE CRIMINAL CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Justice Department officials, hailing unprecedented cooperation with their 
Canadian counterparts, Thursday announced the breakup of a $120-million-a-year 
price-fixing conspiracy in the sales of thermal fax paper throughout North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a Japanese corporation, two American subsidiaries of Japanese 
companies and a former president of one U.S. firm have agreed to plead guilty 
to criminal antitrust charges and pay fines of more than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The international cartel allegedly raised the cost of thermal facsimile paper 
sold in 1991 and 1992 by at least 10%, affecting mainly small businesses and 
home fax machine owners throughout North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne K. Bingaman, chief of the antitrust division, said the case started with 
a complaint from a Toronto businessman about the price of fax paper. This led 
to cooperation between Canadian and U.S. officials in interviewing witnesses 
and sharing of confidential investigative information under a 3-year-old mutual 
assistance treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingaman and George Addy, director of investigation for the Canadian Bureau of 
Competition Policy, told reporters that the price-fixing case was the first 
major use of the 1991 treaty and the convictions were the first obtained under 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went forward in this together working as a team," Bingaman said. The fax 
case is being pursued further, she added, and there are other non-fax areas of 
investigation between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The three firms involved -- Kanzaki Specialty Papers Inc. of Ware, Mass.; 
Mitsubishi Corp. of Tokyo, and Mitsubishi International Corp. of New York -- 
controlled 40% to 45% of the thermal fax paper market in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think consumers will pay less for fax paper as a result," Bingaman said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno added, "Foreign firms that want to do 
business in the U.S. must take our antitrust laws seriously and must play by 
our rules of fair competition when setting prices to be paid by U.S. 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 Of more than $6 million in fines, the Kanzaki firm agreed to pay $4.5 million 
and its former president, Kazuhiko Watanabe, a Japanese national living in 
Tokyo, has been assessed $165,000 in criminal fines. Kanzaki also is paying a 
fine of $686,000 in Canada.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitsubishi Corp., a Japanese trading house with worldwide sales of $130 
billion in many products, agreed to pay a fine of $1.26 million. Mitsubishi 
International of New York will pay a $540,000 criminal fine.  
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, officials said the defendants and unnamed co-conspirators met 
in July, 1991, in Upstate New York and in subsequent telephone calls agreed to 
increase the price of jumbo-roll thermal fax paper in North America. Jumbo 
rolls, weighing up to 2,000 pounds, are unwound and cut into smaller rolls for 
use in fax machines and are less expensive than the thicker fax paper used by 
most large companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Thermal paper is coated with a chemical composition that allows it to accept 
images by a transfer of energy from a thermal print head. Known as "the curly 
type," it is used primarily by small businesses and on home fax machines.  
</P>
<P>
 Kanzaki said in a statement that the price-fixing violation was "an isolated 
incident" and that it has "taken steps to ensure it will not happen again." The 
Massachusetts firm said it has cooperated fully with the Justice Department and 
"resumed a competitive pricing structure."

 Getting a bargain on a hotel room is possible, but it takes patience and 
nimble fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 We recently called eight hotels at random and asked for a standard room on a 
Friday night in July. Then we called each hotel chain's toll-free reservation 
line and asked about rates for the same date. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, reservation agents offered us a high rate first, but came up 
with discounts and specials when we asked. The deals offered by chain-wide 
reservation centers and individual hotels were frequently different. 
</P>
<P>
 We also found that most hotels were willing to give individuals the corporate 
discount rate, but only when asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Our experience with the Radisson Hotel in La Jolla was typical of what we 
found. When we called the hotel directly, the agent quoted us a rate of $85 for 
a standard room. We then asked about specials, and the agent came up with a $79 
corporate rate for a poolside room that usually goes for $139. We pressed on 
and asked about discounts. When we mentioned the Auto Club, the agent came up 
with a rate of $76.50 for a standard room. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we called Radisson's reservation center to see if we could shave the rate 
further. We found we could. The agent first gave us a rate of $95 for a 
standard room. When asked about discounts, the agent came up with $69. With 
more questions, we were able to reduce the rate by nearly 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about room availability also varied. When we called the 
reservation center for Ramada Inns, the agent told us the hotel on San Diego's 
Hotel Circle was booked. When we called the hotel, an agent told us that some 
$79 rooms were available. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, the reservation center had more to offer. When we called the 
Hyatt Newporter directly, a clerk told us the best rate available for a 
standard room was $115 because discount rooms were booked. An agent at the 
chain's reservation center offered a discount rate of $99. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what we found at other hotels. Keep in mind you may not get the same 
rates when you call because discounts and availability vary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Western, Old Town San Diego: The hotel staff quoted a standard room for 
$119; the reservation center offered the same room at $109. Discounts were the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hilton Beach & Tennis Resort, San Diego: When we asked the hotel clerk about 
discounts, we received a quote of $145. The chain's reservation center said the 
best rate available was $170. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marriott Hotel & Tennis Club, Newport: The hotel and reservation center 
offered the same rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Holiday Inn, Laguna Hills: Hotel staff quoted a rate of $89 and said no 
discounts were available. We mentioned Auto Club and were offered $71.10. The 
clerk said that was the lowest rate. An agent at the chain's reservation center 
offered us a standard room for $64. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quality Suites, San Luis Obispo: Hotel staff told us the best rate was 
$112.50; the reservation agent said there was nothing lower than $125. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Odds and ends: Bank of America is waiving the annual fee for MasterCard users 
whose cards are linked to BofA checking accounts. The bank is also shifting to 
a variable interest rate from a fixed rate on its MasterCard -- just when 
interest rates are rising. . . . A San Gabriel Valley resident with two 
American Express cards -- a gold and a green -- reports he has received a 
solicitation for a green American Express card. Don't they know this man?

COMPANY TOWN; GROUP W ALLIANCE GIVES CBS VITAL OUTLETS; TELEVISION: THE BIG 
LOSER IS NBC, WHICH MUST REPLACE KEY STATIONS IN SOME MAJOR CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS Inc., which has been badly shaken since key affiliates defected to Fox, 
entered into a strategic alliance Thursday with Westinghouse Broadcasting that 
will provide the network with outlets in five important markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal gives CBS a valuable boost at a time when morale at the network is 
also down over its scuttled merger plan with QVC Inc. That agreement collapsed 
after Comcast Corp. made a $2.2-billion counteroffer this week for the home 
shopping channel. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS executives have become increasingly concerned over a leadership vacuum 
developing because of Chief Executive Laurence A. Tisch's apparent willingness 
to entertain offers for the company. On Thursday, there was no progress 
reported on that front, though analysts and others continued to speculate that 
Walt Disney Co., Turner Broadcasting Co., Barry Diller or one of the major 
station groups might emerge with a bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisch had hoped a merger with QVC would re-energize the network's management 
by bringing aboard Diller, QVC's chairman. Now, with the merger torpedoed and 
Tisch in a wind-down mode, executives inside the company say the network is, in 
effect, without a chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 While the deal with Westinghouse won't address the leadership problem at CBS, 
it should temporarily quell criticism that the network is on the skids. Under 
the agreement, Westinghouse Broadcasting -- also known as Group W -- will 
convert the affiliations of TV stations it owns in Philadelphia, Boston and 
Baltimore to CBS and renew CBS affiliations in San Francisco and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, which also owns a TV station in Philadelphia, has agreed to sell it or 
swap it for another TV station. The proceeds from the sale of that station, 
which would total between $300 million and $400 million, will go to finance a 
joint venture between CBS and Group W to acquire more stations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, CBS and Group W will jointly produce and distribute "first-run" 
syndicated programs, a lucrative part of the TV business where all the networks 
have been eager to expand. CBS and Group W stations reach nearly a third of all 
TV homes in the country.  
</P>
<P>
 "The most difficult thing in syndication is securing clearances (for new 
shows) with a launch base, and this deal goes a long way to solving that 
problem," said Peter Lund, executive vice president of CBS/Broadcast Group. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS shares rose $5.50 to $313.50 on Thursday, while Westinghouse gained 50 
cents to $12.375. Meanwhile, QVC added $1.44 to $43.44, and Comcast rose 50 
cents to $15.625. The big loser in the CBS-Group W deal is NBC, which will lose 
key affiliations in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Boston -- and must now scramble 
to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 "CBS wins because this ensures their affiliations in some major markets where 
Fox is likely to be a player for an upgrade or change of station." said Matt 
Shapiro, vice president at MMT Sales, a New York-based station consultant. "NBC 
is the one that gets potentially hurt, because they could end up on a UHF 
station in Boston and Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, which is on a weak UHF station in Philadelphia, would probably be 
interested in buying the CBS-owned station there because it would help with its 
National Football League deal. Fox has the broadcast rights to NFL games, 
including home games of the Philadelphia Eagles, starting this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, NBC may face an ugly problem in Boston. The CBS affiliate there is 
owned by Ed Ansin, who also owns a TV station in Miami that had its NBC 
affiliation yanked by that network several years ago, when NBC bought a station 
there. Ansin later affiliated his Miami station with Fox, but the experience 
embittered Ansin toward NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Now NBC is likely to ask Ansin to affiliate on his station in Boston, but he 
is likely to remember NBC's snub in Miami and force the network to affiliate on 
a less desirable UHF station in Boston.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND KATHRYN HARRIS: COMPANY TOWN; QS ABOUT QVC-CBS 
PLAYERS CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and KATHRYN HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the collapse of the CBS-QVC merger, inquiring minds want to know where 
omnipresent cable TV mogul John C. Malone stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast Corp. spoiled his plans with its surprise bid for QVC Inc., of which 
Malone's Liberty Media Corp. owns nearly 19%. Malone had been looking forward 
to owning a piece of CBS Inc., close sources agreed on Thursday. But it's 
unclear whether he will back any new bid for CBS or whether he might counter 
Comcast's bid for QVC with an offer of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 On the QVC issue, one knowledgeable source who was at investment banker 
Herbert Allen Jr.'s annual retreat for high-roller executives Thursday in Sun 
Valley, Ida., said: "There's a lot of speculation . . . that Malone may come in 
on the deal. It's clear that Comcast did not tell him." 
</P>
<P>
 But many others said they would be astounded if Malone bid for QVC, because he 
typically does not engage in bidding wars. They also pointed out that he could 
be challenged on antitrust grounds, as Liberty Media controls the rival Home 
Shopping Network. If Malone is saying he doesn't want to sell his QVC stake, 
sources said, it could indicate an effort to extract a higher cash price or to 
maneuver for a tax-free payment in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone may yet find a way to pursue a CBS investment, but he'll have to do so 
in an indirect manner, because federal rules severely limit cross-ownership of 
cable TV systems and broadcast properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, few can picture QVC Chairman Barry Diller trying to outbid Comcast 
for QVC. Said one analyst: "It's a graceful way for Barry to make a little 
money and leave the company and go find something else to do. His heart wasn't 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation was very different a year ago. Wall Street was enthralled with 
Diller at the time, and Home Shopping Network and QVC were engaged in merger 
talks. Those talks were dropped in November, however, as QVC pursued an 
unsuccessful bid for Paramount Communications Inc. The Federal Trade Commission 
had asked for additional information about the antitrust consequences of the 
network merger, but the scope of the agency's concern is not known. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 11, Liberty Media promised the FTC that it would withdraw from a 
voting trust that controlled QVC and give up its seats on the QVC board during 
the Paramount quest. After the Paramount bid failed, Liberty passed up the 
chance to rejoin the voting trust and Liberty representatives never rejoined 
the board. Observers concluded that Malone did not want to rile antitrust 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the day, the government won't let Malone own both QVC and HSN," 
one cable TV executive declared at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Malone's reputation for boldness is such that some Wall Street analysts 
think he could pull off a merger of the two shopping networks. "A lot of people 
thought that was a doable deal," insisted one who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. "If there is an antitrust problem, he'd find a way around it anyway. 
He could do anything he wants. He's still Malone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the media world's movers and shakers eagerly await Diller's next move, 
he joined most of them Thursday at the Sun Valley Allen & Co. conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller has become the man of the hour at the four-day gathering, where 
executives split their time between provocative business discussions and 
bonding activities such as rafting. Some colleagues predicted that Diller would 
sit out this year's get-together after the QVC-CBS merger blew up in his face, 
but Diller honored his commitment to Allen, a close friend, to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 After Diller jetted in late Thursday, sources said, he was doing his best to 
deflect questions about his future. He had been scheduled to address the 
conference Saturday on QVC. The replacement speakers, ironically, are Viacom 
Chairman Sumner Redstone and President Frank Biondi, who beat Diller in the 
$10-billion Paramount battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Allen & Co. conference is the premier event of its kind for entertainment 
executives because it brings them together with top fund managers and masters 
of other universes, such as billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates. It's also extremely secretive, in keeping with the 
54-year-old Allen's well known penchant for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's New York investment banking firm specializes in media and counts 
Diller and many other conference participants as clients. The timing of this 
year's event is especially good, because the deal-making environment has been 
energized by having CBS, QVC and Diller in play. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one power broker at the event: "They are certainly a center of 
conversation. But they're not the center, because there are so many 
heavyweights here." 
</P>
<P>
 The group includes News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Capital Cities/ABC 
Chairman Thomas S. Murphy, who already have networks, and Walt Disney Co. 
Chairman Michael D. Eisner, who may or may not be in the market for one of his 
own. And then there are former combatants Redstone and TCI's Malone, who are 
reported to be patching things up. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the mix are Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael S. Ovitz, 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga and Sony Corp. of 
America President Michael P. Schulhof. 
</P>
<P>
 And for extra spice there are everyone's favorite corporate dance partners, 
Time Warner Chairman Gerald R. Levin and Seagram Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr. -- 
who has yet to convince skeptics -- Levin among them -- that Seagram's 15% Time 
Warner stock purchase is friendly.

 * Films: Could they be thinking of "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure?" 
China, whose 1.1 billion people are the world's biggest potential group of 
movie viewers, plans to further open its film market by importing 10 
"excellent" foreign films annually, the official news agency Xinhua reported. 
There was no word as to what constitutes an "excellent" film, though the news 
agency said that "experts here believe that they will include some leading 
movies -- for example, the Oscar winners."China began importing films in the 
1950s and '60s, but audiences there usually end up having to watch domestic or 
low-budget action films such as kung fu pictures. Under the new policy, 
producers will share profits with Chinafilm, a foreign film trading company, as 
well as local film businesses. China is estimated to have about 200,000 indoor 
and outdoor movie theaters.

 Judy McGrath's recent promotion to president of MTV has set off massive

programming and talent departments. Adding fuel to that speculation is the 
impending departure of Rick Krim, MTV vice president of music and talent, who 
often acted as MTV's liaison to record companies, which have become 
increasingly upset over what they perceive as MTV's lack of attention to music 
industry needs.

DANA PARSONS: CHALLENGE TO RIPKEN: BE GAME ENOUGH TO STOP JUST SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Baltimore Orioles are in town this weekend to play the Angels, and parents 
should take their children out to see Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. He 
represents everything baseball should be about and will be mentioned long after 
he retires as among the all-time greats. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's no lengthy baseball strike, Ripken is on target to break one of the 
game's most time-honored records next summer. He won't break it by hitting a 
home run or stealing a base or throwing out a runner at first. He'll break the 
record simply by showing up at the ballpark and doing what he's done every day 
since July 1, 1982 -- play. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the axioms of sports is that records are made to be broken. All of 
them, I would argue, except this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Ripken is in reach of sports immortality, I have a suggestion for how 
he could best attain it. 
</P>
<P>
 First, an update for non-baseball fans: Ripken is chasing Lou Gehrig's streak 
of playing in 2,130 consecutive games. Gehrig's streak ended in 1939 when he 
was in the early stages of the disease that would kill him three years later 
just before his 38th birthday. In the 55 years since Gehrig retired, three 
generations of baseball fans have saluted the streak as a near-sacred 
achievement, because Gehrig is remembered as the near-mythic "Iron Horse" and 
because no one has even approached the record. Other than Ripken, who has 
played in 1,983 straight games, no one in baseball history has come within 800 
games of Gehrig's streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken has proved that the record can be broken. If I could, I would ask him 
not to. 
</P>
<P>
 At the risk of being laughed out of town, I would humbly suggest that Ripken 
ensure his place in baseball history by playing his 2,129th consecutive game 
next year and then taking himself out of the lineup the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Why pass up a chance to set a record? 
</P>
<P>
 In its simplest terms, Ripken should do it as a tribute to one of baseball's 
legendary figures. It would be recorded as the most selfless act in baseball 
history. In an era when ballplayers are seen as rich, selfish and uncaring 
about those who came before them, what better message to send? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm making my pitch only because Gehrig's record is different than other 
baseball marks. For example, I would never argue that Ripken not try to hit a 
home run or not try to get a hit every game, if those were the records he were 
chasing. The difference is that those efforts affect the outcome of a game and 
should not be toyed with. Records of skill are, indeed, made to be broken 
because they relate to the purity of competition. A consecutive-games record 
isn't necessarily the product of talent on the field, but of luck, strength of 
will and character. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken's pursuit is unique in that if he chose to bench himself, he wouldn't 
violate the spirit of the game. To the contrary, it has been argued that he 
should have been benched at some point during the last dozen years, if only to 
give him a much-deserved day off while slumping. My point is -- with no 
disrespect intended -- that at some point Ripken's streak turned into a quest 
for Gehrig's record. In that sense, Gehrig's streak has a purer element to it 
in that he wasn't chasing someone else's record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken could remove any taint on his motivation by letting Gehrig keep the 
record. Further, the act of selflessness would be acknowledging the fact that 
Gehrig's streak ended only because of his amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, now 
widely known as ALS instead of "Lou Gehrig's disease." Gehrig obviously would 
have played longer had he not been stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am in no way impugning Ripken's streak. There are elements of it that make 
it even more remarkable than Gehrig's, in that Ripken plays a more demanding 
position -- shortstop as opposed to first base -- and that today's millionaires 
think they're thoroughbreds if they play 140 of a team's 162-game schedule. To 
put Ripken's achievement in perspective, TV announcers noted the other night 
that he needs only 147 games to match Gehrig's record -- and that only three 
other current players have streaks even that long. 
</P>
<P>
 So, no, this isn't about Ripken's worthiness. As with Gehrig, they'll need a 
better grade of bronze when they make Ripken's statuette in Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this is about a chance to do a noble deed that would far outstrip setting 
a record. It would be about respecting the memory of a man and letting stand a 
part of baseball's tradition while in no way undermining the game's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken is such a stand-up guy, he'll probably never sit himself down. But 
he'll sit down someday, and why not after consecutive game No. 2,129? 
</P>
<P>
 By most reckonings, there's no good reason for him to do so other than to pay 
homage to one of America's great and tragic sports heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 My simple question: Why can't that be reason enough? 
</P>

INTEREST RATES FORCE CUTBACKS AT PLAZA HOME; MORTGAGE LOANS: SHARP DROP IN 
REFINANCINGS HAVE COST JOBS OF 28% OF NATIONWIDE WORK FORCE. MORE LAYOFFS ARE 
EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Plaza Home Mortgage Corp., a mortgage banker that had posted big profits in 
recent years, said Thursday that it has cut 28% of its nationwide work force 
and will lose up to $10.4 million for the second quarter as higher interest 
rates began strangling its loan business. 
</P>
<P>
 The holding company for Plaza Home Mortgage Bank said that since interest 
rates started rising early this year, it has laid off 335 of its 1,200 
employees systemwide. It has 40 loan offices in 13 states and a full-service 
branch at its Santa Ana headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "More layoffs are anticipated, but we don't know how many because we don't 
know what the market is going to do now," said spokeswoman Pam Albo. "It's 
feasible that some offices could be closed but only if they become 
unproductive." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said that unaudited financial results, to be released in the next 
few weeks, will show that the company lost $9.2 million to $10.4 million for 
the second quarter, or 80 cents to 90 cents a share. In last year's second 
quarter, Plaza earned $3.3 million, or 29 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutbacks have been routine among mortgage banks this year as rising interest 
rates have ended the long growth in home loan refinancings. A year ago, Plaza's 
refinancings constituted 74% of its loans, but this year refinancings dropped 
to 36% of its volume. 
</P>
<P>
 Savings and loans that hold onto loans they make are doing well, but mortgage 
bankers, who rely on high volume and sell all their loans, have been hard hit. 
Plaza's mortgage bank unit is an S&L that acts as a mortgage banker. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza's staff cuts over the last six months were across the board, though a 
bit more were among loan officers. The layoffs include 108 employees at its 
headquarters and at loan offices in Anaheim and Laguna Beach. Headquarters 
alone lost 72 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 John T. French, Plaza's chairman, said in a press release that the company was 
not able to reduce its staff and consolidate operations fast enough when the 
mortgage market turned. Besides feeling the pinch from lower volume, the thrift 
was bruised by intense competition, lower-than-expected interest income and 
losses from securities investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consistent with our goal of long-term growth, we made a business decision not 
to sell large blocks of valuable servicing rights to offset the quarter's 
operational loss," French said. The first phase of Plaza's restructuring was 
completed two weeks ago and, he said, "is expected to produce a marked 
improvement in Plaza's operating results in the third quarter and later this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock closed Thursday at $5.5625 a share, down to 81.25 cents a 
share on the Nasdaq market system. Albo said shares at all publicly traded 
mortgage banking firms have been falling since interest rates starting rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza's thrift is the nation's 22nd-largest provider of home financing and has 
been among the leaders in lending in poor and in minority areas. It created a 
subsidiary, Option One, to provide loans to credit-worthy borrowers who didn't 
meet standard credit criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The company earned $6.6 million last year and a record $14.5 million the 
previous year. It funded a record $8.3 billion in loans last year and $5.6 
billion in 1992.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: FLOUR DANIEL INC. WINS $100-MILLION CONTRACT FOR ENERGY 
PLANT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fluor Daniel Inc. said Thursday that it has won a $100-million contract to 
provide engineering and procurement services for retrofitting a waste-to-energy 
plant in Niagara Falls, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine company, the main subsidiary of Fluor Corp., said the project 
includes replacing the existing system with a mass burn combustion system 
consisting of two new boilers, each capable of processing about 1,000 tons of 
municipal solid waste every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Constructors International, also a Fluor Corp. unit, will provide 
construction management services on the contract, which was awarded by American 
Ref-Fuel Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering is underway at Fluor Daniel's Houston office, and construction is 
expected to start in early 1995. The job, which will employ 350 workers at its 
peak, is scheduled to be completed in late 1996.

OFFICE VACANCY RATE DIPS BY ALMOST 2 POINTS TO 17.8%; REAL ESTATE: COUNTY'S 
COMMERCIAL MARKET STRENGTHENS IN NEAR-TOTAL ABSENCE OF BUILDING ACTIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Orange County commercial real estate market continues to strengthen, with 
the office vacancy rate at midyear nearly two percentage points lower than it 
was a year ago, according to figures released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Grubb & Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services in Newport Beach said local 
industrial and retail properties also showed improvement during the first half, 
with 13 new shopping centers under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely in the process of a full-blown recovery right now. In all 
three sectors -- office, retail and industrial -- the vacancies are dropping, 
and the markets are tightening," said George Economos, senior vice president 
for office properties at Grubb & Ellis. "While we're seeing moderately heavy 
construction in retail, we don't expect new construction in office (space) 
until the latter part of this decade." 
</P>
<P>
 The improved office vacancy rate, now 17.8%, stems partly from a lack of 
building activity. Only one building, the 216,000-square-foot State Fund 
Compensation site in Santa Ana, is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy rate, which peaked at 25% in 1988, was 19.6% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With fewer offices standing vacant, rental rates have stabilized and in some 
cases moved higher, according to the Grubb & Ellis report. In prime locations, 
office space is renting for $1.45 monthly per square foot, up at least 5 cents 
from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The retail market, too, is improving, with the new shopping centers expected 
to add 3.7 million square feet of space, said John Davidson, a Grubb & Ellis 
retail broker. A big chunk of that activity is the 800,000-square-foot retail 
center under construction at Foothill Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said plans for most of the new retail centers have some type of 
entertainment component, including eight new cinema complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that theaters have replaced department stores as anchors for retail 
centers," Davidson said. "People are going to retail centers not just to shop 
but to be entertained as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, new construction is contributing to a rise in retail vacancy rates, 
which was 6.2% at midyear, compared to 5.3% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial space, however, saw a massive drop in its vacancy rate, which fell 
to 14.5% in the latest survey from 19.6% a year ago. The drop was driven by 
increased activity by small entrepreneurial tenants and a lack of construction, 
brokers said. Fewer Empty Offices 
</P>
<P>

quarter, nearly two percentage points lower than it was in the same period last 
year: Airport area

 Advantage Life Products: A group of investors has called off talks that would 
have led to its purchase of 3 million shares of the Irvine marketer of health 
and beauty products. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't come together. The timing just wasn't right for them. Some of 
these things never gel," said Dr. Carl Bozzo of Irvine, who was leading the 
investment group. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative agreement had called for the investment group to buy the stock, 
which represents a 22% ownership stake in the company. In return, the group 
could install Bozzo as Advantage Life's chairman. He then would have been 
allowed to nominate two other directors to the company's board.

TRIAL BY FIRE; SANTA ANA TORCHES HOME TO SHOW DANGER OF TENANT CROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside a three-bedroom home crammed from floor to ceiling with clothes and 
furniture, firefighter Jim Albers sparked his lighter Thursday and set fire to 
a small trash can filled with paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Spreading rapidly through the cluttered room, the fire gave off so much heat 
that, within two minutes, even items not directly in contact with it exploded 
into flames. Soon, the windows shattered and spewed out inky, black smoke so 
dense it completely obscured the fire inside. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all a test as firefighters burned the vacant two-story Bristol Street 
home to demonstrate how swiftly fires can sweep through overcrowded residences. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a hell of lot faster than it should have been," Albers said 
afterward. "These fires spread extremely fast." 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone had been living inside when the blaze started, he said, "after two 
minutes and eight seconds, they either got outside by themselves or they're 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The large amount of clothing and belongings from multiple families found in 
overcrowded homes provides more fuel for a fire than in homes where fewer 
people live. As a result, fires spread faster and are potentially deadlier, 
according to Fire Chief Allen (Bud) Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, information on precisely how fires spread in a home remains scarce 
because such tests are done rarely, and then usually only on commercial or 
industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's ironic, because 80% of fire deaths occur in a residential setting," 
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, much of the information that modern firefighters rely on comes from 
studies in the 1920s and 1940s. Up-to-date information is crucial to save the 
lives of residents and protect the safety of firefighters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Fire Department conducted the test burn with help from the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology, a division of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce. The data will be used to create a computer model 
describing how fire spreads, enabling firefighters across the nation to improve 
their training and permit architects to design safer buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Predicting how fires behave also will make public education and 
fire-prevention programs more successful, virtually assuring that the 
information from the test will eventually save lives, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the test, technicians placed in each room several sophisticated 
temperature probes on copper wires strung from floor to ceiling. Every three 
seconds, each probe relayed data to a central computer which recorded the 
temperature, direction and spread of the fire as it moved through the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The home used in the test previously housed 15 residents with only three 
bedrooms. Before the test, it was stocked with hundreds of pairs of pants, 
shirts and other clothing as well as beds and couches to simulate overcrowded 
conditions that are found routinely in local residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Albers started the fire, it took just over two minutes before the living 
room became impassable, blocking off potential escape routes for anyone who 
would have been in the bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 If 15 people had been inside the home, the adults might have been able to 
break a window and escape if they had sufficient warning, but the thick black 
smoke and heat would have hampered their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In that situation, "children, the infirm and people looking for their children 
are going to die," even if firefighters arrive within the ideal four-minute 
response time, Albers said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are especially interested in the test results because in a 
recent 13-month period in Santa Ana, nine people were killed and 10 others were 
injured in fires in overcrowded homes. 
</P>
<P>
 State law permits as many as 10 people to live in a one-bedroom home, and city 
officials have lobbied the Legislature unsuccessfully for years to reduce that 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that tighter occupancy standards would discriminate against 
low-income residents and minorities, and could leave many families homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 However, City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. rejected that view, saying that 
permitting low-income families to live in potentially lethal overcrowded 
conditions is discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current state ordinance is a dangerous code," he said. "Overcrowding 
means a greater incidence of fires, but also if a fire starts, its spread is so 
quick that by the time people are aware of it, they're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Nodding toward the charred house, he added, "this is just an illustration of 
how quickly death can come."

HUNDREDS OF FANS FUME WHILE BRAZIL'S STARS SHOP; SOCCER: MANY WHO SOUGHT 
PLAYERS' AUTOGRAPHS AT A SPORTING GOODS STORE ARE LEFT DISAPPOINTED. 
</P>

 Hundreds of soccer fans chanting "Brazil, ole, ole, ola!" swarmed to Niketown 
on Thursday to cheer half a dozen members of the Brazilian soccer team, flush 
from a victory that sent it into the World Cup final round, as they went on a 
shopping spree. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cheers quickly turned to jeers with an announcement by Niketown 
representatives that the fans' favorite player, Romario, would rather go 
shopping inside the store than sign autographs for the fans outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario, the star forward on Brazil's team and Nike promoter, was not 
scheduled to have an autograph session, but more than 300 fans showed up at the 
store and waited hours to get a glimpse of the player who many believe will 
lead the South American team to victory Sunday when Brazil meets Italy in the 
the World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had skipped work or school to be on hand for his appearance, but only a 
handful were lucky enough to get Romario's autograph after his hourlong 
shopping spree, which added tennis outfits, mesh basketball shorts, walking 
shoes, a slew of hats, bags and T-shirts to his wardrobe, and provided sweat 
shirts for his children, said Maggie Del Real, a Niketown saleswoman who 
followed Romario around the store with a large shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was overwhelmed and my hands were shaking for the first half-hour," Del 
Real said. "But I was just trying to keep up with him." 
</P>
<P>
 After he had made his selections, Romario quickly signed some soccer balls, 
trading cards, magazines and T-shirts for about 30 people before quietly rising 
from the table inside the store where he had been signing autographs and 
departing, leaving hundreds of disappointed fans still lined up outside the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed work today for this," said Pablo Rios, 30, of Costa Mesa. "Fifteen 
dollars an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Rios had brought his daughter, son and nephew to the event, and still lingered 
in the store after Romario disappeared. The children, dressed in striped soccer 
uniforms and cleats, clutched unsigned soccer balls. 
</P>
<P>
 They were hoping to see the other five players, who arrived about 2:30 p.m. to 
take their pick of sporting shoes and shirts. But shopping was the top priority 
for the other players too. Nike, a sponsor of the Brazilian team, gives team 
members an undisclosed amount to to spend on Nike products. 
</P>
<P>
 A few appreciative fans managed to sneak an autograph or two as the team 
members strolled among the aisles and perused the Nike merchandise for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But one local fan was so offended by the snubbing that he said he would be 
cheering for Italy this Sunday. "They don't appreciate the fans following and 
looking up to them," said Carlos Rodriguez, 20, of Costa Mesa. "I really don't 
care now. It doesn't make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the visit to Niketown by Romario and the other Brazilian team members 
had not been announced to the public in advance, fans began forming a line 
outside the store even before it opened at 10 a.m. Three hours later, hundreds 
hovered around the store's entrance wearing yellow Brazil soccer team T-shirts 
and promotional Nike caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-year-old Alex Lenus of San Clemente, who was one of the first in line, 
said he "grabbed the car and came down here real quick," as soon as he heard of 
the expected appearance.

'SLIGHT PROBLEM' IS DOUBLE TROUBLE IN STATE KENO GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A "slight problem" with a California Lottery computer Sunday left holders of 
nearly 3,000 winning Five Spot Keno Special tickets statewide without the 
double payoff promised in the lottery's promotion for the new game. 
</P>
<P>
 For 19 hours on the promotion's first day -- from 6 a.m. Sunday to 1 a.m. 
Monday -- the Keno computers were not programmed to pay double to people who 
correctly picked four of five or five of five numbers on the television screens 
where the game is played, lottery spokeswoman Norma Minas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, 2,831 winning tickets held by people who selected four of five numbers 
-- or "spots" in lottery parlance -- paid off at $10, instead of $20, Minas 
said. And 142 tickets sold to people who correctly chose five of five numbers 
during that period paid out $250, instead of the promised $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery officials will make good on the double payoff for anyone holding a 
winning ticket issued during that period, Minas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion, which is scheduled to continue through July 24, applied only to 
those who played 10 consecutive times, Minas said. The affected Keno wagers 
made up less than 1% of the 318,281 tickets sold that day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a slight problem with it, but it was corrected by the time the 
computer came back up Monday morning," Minas said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the lottery must verify a winning ticket before it will double the 
payoff. Once word of the problem trickled out this week, some have called the 
lottery office in Sacramento hoping to come up a winner without benefit of a 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked all of them to submit a claim form with their ticket," Minas said. 
"Some of them (said), 'Well, I didn't buy a ticket.' " If you didn't buy a 
ticket, you didn't play." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, lottery officials received about 60 calls from players and retailers 
who said they were owed a double payoff, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery officials were still sorting out exactly what went wrong, Minas said, 
but believe the program for the promotion was loaded into the computer 
incorrectly Saturday night, before the scheduled Sunday start-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Those holding winning tickets may contact the lottery directly to submit their 
claims or pick up a claim form from the store or restaurant where they 
purchased the ticket.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; TEENS LEARN WORK ETHIC ON THE FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Working on a farm was hardly Tom Nguyen's idea of summer fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really a lazy person," said Nguyen, 17. "I'd rather be where there are no 
flies or bad odor." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the last three weeks, Nguyen has fed cows and chickens, herded sheep, 
cleaned pigpens and helped prepare the soil for a pumpkin crop at a six-acre 
farm behind Westminster High School on Golden West Street. 
</P>
<P>
 His hands have become a bit calloused from fixing broken fences and felling 
dying trees, but the lanky teen-ager, who will be a senior at Our Lady Queen of 
Angels High School in Mission Hills when classes resume in September, has 
learned to like the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning self-discipline," he said recently as he made his rounds clad in 
shorts, a T-shirt and a baseball cap to shield him from the noonday sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen is one of 120 youngsters, ages 14 to 21, who are participating in a 
federally funded summer youth employment program run by the city's Community 
Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Driscol, who has coordinated the program the last two years, said that 
participants gain work experience, learn about taking responsibility and stay 
out of trouble during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants are paid $4.25 an hour, and some make as much as $1,300 by the 
end of the 10-week program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just a job, this is a maturing process," said Driscol. "I want 
them to come out of this with better self-esteem, better work habits, and more 
aware of what's there in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants are generally selected on a first-come, first-served basis, but 
most come from poor families. Many are dropouts or have trouble in school. Some 
are pregnant, some are young parents and some have limited English skills, 
which makes it hard for them to find regular jobs, Driscol said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to job training, participants receive instructions in cultural 
diversity, the dangers of gang involvement, and such skills as doing a budget 
and balancing a checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, who has five brothers and three sisters, said he has problems 
adjusting at home, and the program keeps him out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here for the money," he said, adding that his family earns enough 
money from a sewing business so he can attend a private school. "I want to stay 
busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Nghia Nguyen, (no relation to Tom Nguyen), said he accepted the farm job 
because of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to send some of it to my parents in Vietnam," said Nghia Nguyen, who 
left his country by boat when he was 14 and now lives with an aunt in 
Westminster. He has two younger sisters still in Vietnam, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nghia Nguyen wants to join the Marines or, if he is not accepted, take an 
automotive course at Cerritos College in the fall. He will use the money from 
his summer job to pay for his tuition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I was bothered by the smell and the dust," said Nghia Nguyen. "Now, 
I'm used to it. Besides, I need the money." 
</P>
<P>
 The farm is owned by the Huntington Beach Union High School District, 
according to Jerry Gragson, 43, who runs the farm. It has 15 head of cattle, 25 
pigs, about 100 chickens and nine Barbados sheep.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ORANGEWOOD SAYS SO LONG TO 'CHIEF' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's nothing John Poynter can do about the parade of black eyes. Nor can he 
mend the tiny arms fractured by abusive parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his own unique way, the chief cook at Orangewood Children's Home has 
touched the lives of countless hundreds of children in Orange County. Simply 
put, he bakes each child a cake on his or her birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Poynter, 67, is retiring July 31, ending a 10-year career at the home for 
abused and neglected children in Orange. On Thursday, the employees and 
children of Orangewood threw a tearful, surprise farewell for the man known to 
many simply as "Chief." 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to do something for the kids," Poynter said. "Some of them have never 
even seen a birthday cake before. It gives them a lift, but it gives me a lift 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Poynter's cakes are legendary. If a child likes cowboys, he transforms colored 
icings into a scene on the range with horses circling a corral. 
</P>
<P>
 He has fulfilled countless requests for Ninja Turtles and Morphin Power 
Rangers. He even uses an airbrush for more intricate designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The cakes give kids who have been physically abused or neglected a rare 
occasion to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Katheren Dickinson, 22, who spent three months at Orangewood when she was 16, 
said Poynter's cakes bring back fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a time for people to be recognized on their birthday," she said. 
"There was a lot of sharing that went on." 
</P>
<P>
 Poynter says he first came up with the idea for making the cakes 20 years ago 
when he worked at a children's home in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the cakes that they were buying and I figured I could make a better 
cake than that," said the gravel-voiced former Navy chief petty officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Poynter's staff had nothing but praise for their retiring 
supervisor. They recounted the time that a gangly, wide-eyed teen-ager standing 
in the cafeteria line told Poynter he liked his flight jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Poynter removed the jacket and draped it over the boy's shoulders. He later 
told his co-workers that he could always buy another jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "He goes out of his way to do things for the kids," said Jodie Harris, 62, who 
helps prepare meals for children on special diets. "He's like family. We're 
sure going to miss him." TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; HOW COUPLE TAPPED A LUCRATIVE MARKET

 Success in business came almost by accident for Mike and Paula Estabrook, who 
recently won the South County Chambers of Commerce Small Business of the Year 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking to gain an edge in the home construction industry, the Estabrooks 
began offering water filtration systems to make their new residences more 
attractive to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 People liked the taste of their water, and soon the Estabrooks began getting 
far more orders for purifying systems than for new homes. "Neighbors called, 
the word spread," Mike Estabrook said. "We began doing more business in water 
filtration than construction." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple started Pacific Water Products in Laguna Hills. Last year, their 
fifth in business, the company added 200 accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Estabrook said the keys to success where his becoming involved in the chamber 
of commerce and in Toastmasters, a public speaking group. "The Toastmasters 
helped give me confidence to sell my product," he said. "At the chamber, I 
heard of other people's successes and failures, and it gave us ideas on how to 
run our business." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Estabrook was recently named president of the Laguna Hills chapter of the 
South County Chambers of Commerce. He said his friends on the chamber gave him 
no clue about the small-business award. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a complete surprise to me," he said. "I'm very proud of this honor." 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber gave its Large Business of the Year award to United Postal Service 
for instituting a successful ride-share program and for its contributions to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the chamber gave Businesswoman and Businessman of the Year 
awards, honoring Gina Lamourelle, owner of Children's Discover Center, and 
David Weiss, owner of David Weiss Designs, a jewelry business. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamourelle worked on establishing Mission Viejo's first celebration of Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day and has lobbied state legislators to enact tougher 
regulation of the construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss is a past president of the Morasha Jewish Day School and the Exchange 
Club of Saddleback Valley and has been active in the Rotary Club. FRANK MESSINA

 The first store in the Marketplace at Laguna Niguel -- a Mervyn's department 
store -- opened Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to store manager Jacki Ebel, business was brisk at the 
77,000-square-foot store, which is the first of three major stores planned for 
the center.Although job fairs for prospective Mervyn's salespeople in June were 
only lightly attended, Ebel said the store is fully staffed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 525,000-square-foot center at Alicia Parkway and Pacific Park Drive is 
expected to bring in roughly $1 million a year in sales tax revenue to the 
city, said City Manager Tim Casey. 
</P>
<P>
 An 80,000-square-foot Vons Superstore is expected to open in the Marketplace 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major store will be a 130,000-square-foot Wal-Mart, the first in 
Orange County. It is expected to open early next year.LYNN FRANEY

 Three Orange County high school students are on a nine-concert European tour 
with the American Musical Ambassadors Band. 
</P>
<P>
 The students are Jennifer Fisher of Fountain Valley and Jean Kim of 
Westminster, both juniors this fall at La Quinta High School, and San Juan 
Capistrano resident Jason Minch, who graduated this year from Capistrano Valley 
High School in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, which is made up of students from across the country, is divided 
into two touring groups of 106 members each. The conductors are Prof. Robert 
Foster from the University of Kansas, and Prof. Richard Floyd from the 
University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Musical Ambassadors Band has performed in European cities for the 
past 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, nearly 5,000 young musicians have taken part in the tours, which are 
designed to foster cultural appreciation and personal relationships between 
Europeans and Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The students assembled in Washington in early July for rehearsals and a 
concert before flying to Holland on July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour stops are scheduled in Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France and 
England before the students return home July 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Band members are performing works by American and European composers including 
John Philip Sousa, Gustav Mahler, Robert E. Foster and Ralph Vaughan Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to appearing at concert halls and major parks, the students are 
visiting European sites of musical and historical importance and making stops 
at popular tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizing and directing the tour is Maxine Lefever, who was a member of the 
band faculty at Purdue University for 25 years.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HOME INVADERS BIND, BEAT, ROB FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robbers tied up a Santa Ana family at home Wednesday night and escaped with 
money, jewelry and the family's Mercedes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers ransacked the apartment as Se Touch and Lap Ko and their five 
children were held on the floor at gunpoint, said Sgt. Dick Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 The family told police the robbers numbered two to four. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was seriously injured, and the car was recovered undamaged in Midway 
City, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Touch, 60, came home from visiting a neighbor downstairs shortly after 8 p.m. 
to find his family tied up and robbers going through the apartment, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pistol-whipped and then bound too, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the stolen property was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 home-invasion robberies have been reported in Santa Ana, Garden 
Grove and Westminster since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are carried out by Asian or Latino gangs, police say. Immigrant families 
often are targeted in the belief that they keep money and valuables at home.

 The governing board of the Santa Ana Unified School District has bid farewell 
to Supt. Rudy Castruita, praising his nine years of service to the district as 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will certainly miss Rudy's guidance, intelligence and leadership," Trustee 
Robert W. Balen said during the board's regular meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (his) legacy is going to live on for many years" in the college work 
and careers of the 50,000 students he helped educate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of about 200 parents and community members offered Castruita a 
standing ovation during the board meeting, which was Castruita's final one as 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 He leaves the district today to become superintendent of schools for San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure, the district's dropout rate plummeted 45%, 10 campuses were 
named National Distinguished Schools and another 26 campuses received state 
Golden Bell awards for educational excellence.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; PARK USE DECISION STIRS LOCAL DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For eight years, Arroyo Park has been a little-known, little-used facility in 
the middle of town, but recent events made the park a lightning rod for 
contention in the community between supporters of youth sports and advocates of 
multiuse parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked out of sight behind Fire Station No. 32 and a Lutheran church on Yorba 
Linda Boulevard, the park can be accessed only via a horse trail that connects 
it to nearby streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the park knew its use would increase when the city announced 
recently that it had approved a land swap with the church and would use the 
church land it had acquired to build a parking lot and access road to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were stunned when park officials recommended a plan to develop the 
park into a senior baseball field to serve youth sports, instead of the 
equestrian ring and picnic areas originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changing the use of this park from one that the whole community can benefit 
from to one that serves a very small group of people for a very limited time is 
ridiculous," residents Alan and Carol Bledsoe said in a letter to Steve 
Rudometkin, director of the Parks and Recreation Department. "There's no reason 
why the . . . needs of a selected few people should outweigh the community as a 
whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the baseball field was eventually rejected by the City Council in 
favor of the original plan, many residents are convinced that the city is more 
concerned with the needs of youth sports organizations than those who use parks 
for picnics, for walks and in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth sports is frequently dragged into many city debates, ranging from the 
proposed annexation of a neighboring high school to gain its athletic fields, 
to why most adult hobby groups pay to use city facilities while youth sports 
teams play for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents "might have won this time, but more times than not it's the 
sports teams that prevail," said a longtime resident who asked not be named. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory is especially sweet for horse owners, who will benefit from a 
60-by-120-foot equestrian ring and improvements to the horse trail that winds 
around the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Other improvements planned for the park include replacing existing play 
equipment, installing picnic tables and adding walkways and landscaping, 
Rudometkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to start in four to six months and should take three 
months to complete. The improvements will cost about $410,000, Rudometkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The land swap that made the project possible will give Grace Lutheran Church a 
two-acre parcel on Fairmont Boulevard in exchange for the 1 1/2-acre lot on 
Yorba Linda Boulevard. The church will continue to occupy its current site 
until a new building is completed on Fairmont Boulevard. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; POLICE DEPARTMENT HONORS 7 FOR SERVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven members of the Police Department were honored Thursday at the 31st 
annual Police Awards Luncheon for outstanding service during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce sponsored the community event. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Phillips, an 18-year veteran, was honored as Officer of the Year, said 
Barbara Scott, secretary to Police Chief David L. Snowden. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips "closed more of his cases than anybody else" last year while working 
as a detective, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He treated every case, no matter how minor it might seem, as a biggie," Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His investigations dealt with homicide, rape, narcotics violations, gang 
activity, gambling and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilian of the Year honors went to Holly Carver, an administrative assistant 
in charge of crime analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 A nine-year veteran of the department, Carver combines her knowledge of 
statistics and computers to help police prevent crime and apprehend criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "She now puts all the crime statistics into forms and comes up with 
probabilities of when the next bank robbery is going to be and where it's going 
to be and even who's going to do it," Scott said. "It's amazing, the numbers 
that are floating in her head." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Schleider and Robert Stock were recognized as Reserve Officers of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Schleider has been honored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving for making more 
than 100 drunk-driving arrests during each of the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock's contributions include buying and distributing toys to children in 
local hospitals during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 Also recognized were Officers Bob Fate, Russ Rose and Jess Gilman, who 
received awards from the California Highway Patrol for their efforts in 
recovering stolen vehicles. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COAST PANEL OKS BOLSA CHICA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission on Thursday gave a green light to 3.3 acres 
of a proposed 106-acre park on the southeast edge of the Bolsa Chica wetlands, 
despite the objections of some environmentalists and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great breakthrough," Robert Fisher, the county's director of harbors, 
beaches and parks, said of the commission's action. "It's a symbolic start to a 
much larger park that we've been trying to get going on for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Monroe, a member of the Sierra Club's Preserve Bolsa Chica Task Force, 
disagreed. "I'm terribly unhappy," he said. "We have a responsibility to turn 
over a healthy planet to our children, and this park won't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Overturning the recommendation of its own Planning Commission, the City 
Council had approved a first phase of the park in May. But a group of residents 
and environmentalists appealed that decision to the state Coastal Commission, 
contending that the proposed relocation of a culvert and filling of a 120-foot 
drainage ditch would adversely affect the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials apparently overcame that objection by agreeing to proceed 
with only the first 3.3 acres of the project, which does not include the 
culvert and drainage. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday the commission, while acknowledging that the environmentalists' 
appeal raises "substantial issues" regarding the project, unanimously approved 
the initial 3.3-acre increment. County officials promised that before 
proceeding with the rest of the project they will alter their plan to eliminate 
environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of even the first few acres, however, raised the hackles of some 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the commissioners, representatives of several groups -- 
including the Sierra Club, Bolsa Chica Land Trust, Huntington Beach Tomorrow 
and the Surfrider Foundation -- had requested that the commission add several 
conditions to its approval of the project's first increment, among them that: 
</P>
<P>
 * The removal of non-native vegetation be done by volunteers provided by the 
various groups -- rather than by contractors or construction equipment -- to 
minimize the disturbance to existing wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county hire a wetlands restoration expert to oversee the work. 
</P>
<P>
 * A proposed pedestrian trail be made of crushed granite to reduce its impact 
on the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 * A comprehensive survey be made of archeological sites in the immediate area 
before work commences. 
</P>
<P>
 * A ranch-type fence be installed to deter developers of adjacent housing 
projects from destroying wildlife habitat by running bulldozers over the park. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the requested conditions were included in the final approval, although 
Fisher said the county sympathizes with their intent. "We agree with the 
spirit" of the recommendations, he said. "We intend to do the project 
sensitively with a minimum of" damage to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents' and environmentalists' reactions ranged from anger to acceptance. 
Marcia Hanscom, an area resident, said she was hopeful but skeptical that the 
county would do the right thing. "We'll keep working with them," she said. "I'm 
willing to give them a chance."DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; FBI ARRESTS DOCTOR ON FRAUD CHARGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 49-year-old doctor suspected of defrauding a medical insurance company in 
Minnesota of more than $40,000 was arrested at his practice by FBI agents, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagesh Shetty of Huntington Beach was released on his own recognizance 
Wednesday after appearing before a U.S. magistrate in Santa Ana.He faces 28 
counts of mail fraud, FBI spokesman Gary Morley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shetty was arrested Tuesday at Harbor Newport Medical Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury in Minneapolis returned an indictment on June 7, alleging 
that Shetty mailed fraudulent insurance claims to Blue Cross-Blue Shield of 
Minnesota for nonexistent, medically unnecessary or excessive medical 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment also alleges that over a nine-month period beginning in 
January, 1993, Shetty submitted numerous fraudulent health insurance claims to 
the company for medical treatments and lab tests that he never performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Shetty operated as a sole practitioner, the indictment alleges that 
he submitted claims using two separate provider numbers, one in his name and 
the other in the name of the Harbor Newport Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Shetty could be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison 
and fined up to $250,000 on each of the 28 counts.GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SELF-DEFENSE TEACHER WARY OF PEPPER SPRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ted Encinas teaches self-defense techniques using pepper spray and traditional 
tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has strong misgivings about using pepper spray, which became legal for 
civilian use in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Encinas, who will teach a self-defense workshop at Orange Coast College this 
month, is a retired Santa Ana police officer who owns and operates California 
Security Academy in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I educate them as to what is available and what the liabilities are," the 
53-year-old Costa Mesa resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after taking his course, students are 10 times more likely to purchase 
traditional CN and CS types of tear gas than pepper spray, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires people purchasing tear gas, including pepper spray, to have 
a certificate showing they have successfully completed a self-defense course in 
its use. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that concerns Encinas about pepper sprays is the deaths that have 
occurred after the disabling device was used by police officers on suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 When the product enters the body through the eyes, nose or mouth, immediate 
effects include bronchial spasms, swelling of mucous membranes and restricted 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 The only brand of pepper spray approved for public use against humans in 
California is First Defense, which is made by Defense Technology Corp. of 
America of Casper, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokesman Michael Reed said about 30 deaths have occurred after the 
use of pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 But all these fatalities were caused by other factors, such as heart 
conditions and heavy intoxication, rather than the pepper spray itself, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our formula is totally natural," according to Reed, who said the active 
ingredient, which is extracted from a pepper seed, is purchased from a spice 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could eat it if you could stand it," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California has weighed in on 
the issue by calling for additional research on the possible medical hazards of 
pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the ACLU maintains that the effectiveness of pepper spray has 
been "vastly over-promoted," according to Public Affairs Director Allan 
Parachini. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are afraid that people will have entirely too much confidence in it," said 
Parachini, who testified in the case of an Oregon police officer who was beaten 
to death in 1992 by a suspect who had just been doused with pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Parachini is concerned that an attacker could turn on the user and "become 
significantly more violent" after being sprayed, that the pepper spray could be 
turned against the owner, and that the public will ignore options such as 
running away or screaming for help in dangerous situations. 
</P>
<P>
 When tear gas or pepper gas does work properly, an attacker can be quickly 
subdued -- even at distances up to 25 feet, Encinas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of the spray typically bend over in intense pain, temporarily blinded 
by tears, and the noxious effects often last for about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're coughing, you're gagging, your eyes are burning, your skin is 
burning," Encinas said. 
</P>
<P>
 An advantage of tear gas over other weapons is that the small canisters are 
easy to hold and quick to use, said Encinas, who discourages people from 
purchasing guns for home defense unless they commit to an ongoing training 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-defense workshop is scheduled for 9 a.m. to noon Saturday, July 23, 
at the college, 2701 Fairview Road in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee is $49, which includes a tear gas certification card. 
</P>

POOR ARE SUFFERING FROM ABSENTEE DEFENSE, CRITICS SAY; COURTS: PANEL OF JUDGES,

 The proposed reorganization of Orange County's largest contract for defending 
poor criminal defendants drawing fire Thursday as critics charged that Santa 
Ana attorney William W. Stewart should be held more accountable for 
representing clients in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the loudest of those critics, South Municipal Court Judge Pamela L. Iles 
said Stewart's long absence from daily court proceedings and his many outside 
business interests in Colombia, Russia and Las Vegas have sapped his ability to 
provide effective representation to poor people accused of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have here are poor people who are at the mercy of the courts to 
oversee their rights, but that can't be done when you have an attorney who is 
out of the country a lot of the time communicating with the court . . . by 
telephone or fax," said Iles, who is a member of the county committee that 
oversees contract policy. 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, Orange County director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, said that the reorganization plan smacked of favoritism and 
the proposed changes don't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan offered Wednesday by Central Municipal Court judges would allow 
Stewart to retain a financial stake in the contract for the Santa Ana 
courthouse, but it asks that he share the huge caseload equally with two other 
law firms.  
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Central Court Judge Gregory H. Lewis said Thursday that the judges 
did not consider Stewart's long-distance administration of the contract to be a 
problem and did not address the issue in their closed-door discussions of the 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these days of modern technology, you could just as easily be doing 
business here from San Bernardino as South America," Lewis said. "Bill Stewart 
is a gentleman. We don't have a problem with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Stewart has more than a year remaining on his contract, worth nearly $1 
million a year, judges said, the entire reorganization hinges on whether 
Stewart approves of the Central Court's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said the arrangement does not have to be ratified by the Board of 
Supervisors. Neither does it require Stewart to refrain from his many 
out-of-country business interests nor ask that he personally represent clients 
in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis declined to say whether the reorganization proposal had won unanimous 
approval from the Santa Ana jurists. All 15 Central Court judges attended 
Wednesday's closed meeting. All requests for comment were referred to Lewis' 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who has been the subject of criticism in recent weeks for his 
handling of the nearly $1-million-a-year contract, had not responded to the 
court's plan Thursday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacio asked how the judges could retain Stewart while knowing that he has 
subcontracted many of his cases to other attorneys and that he maintains 
outside business interests far from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judges have admitted that there are problems, but they don't seem to be 
willing to correct them," Palacio said. "It seems to me that there are 
inefficiencies in having someone administer a contract from another country." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the judges "need to deal with the public image of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said the judges' talks have centered on a concern that Stewart's firm 
had not been able to provide enough attorneys to cover court appearances for 
poor clients. 
</P>
<P>
 If Stewart were to agree to the reorganization plan, Lewis said, his Santa Ana 
law firm would share the indigent caseload with the law firms of Patrick McNeal 
and Laz & Hill, which now serve as backups to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office generally provides legal services to indigent 
clients, but must defer to private firms under county contract when conflicts 
arise in cases where there are multiple defendants. In Santa Ana, Stewart's 
firm has held the contract for such referrals for the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The backup defense firms of Patrick McNeal and Laz & Hall have handled only 
those Central Court contract cases in which Stewart's firm has disqualified 
itself because of perceived conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said Thursday he had not talked with the backup firms about the 
reorganization because Stewart has not told him of his decision in the matter.

NATIONAL TEACHERS CONVENTION OPENS IN ANAHEIM TODAY; EDUCATION: VIOLENCE, 
TEACHING STANDARDS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THE HOT-BUTTON ISSUES FOR 4,000 AFT 
DELEGATES. VICE PRESIDENT GORE WILL BE AMONG THE SPEAKERS.

<P>
 A host of prominent political figures, including Vice President Al Gore, will 
address the 73rd American Federation of Teachers convention, which begins today 
at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The five-day convention will include speeches by Education Secretary Richard 
Riley, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner and Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,000 delegates representing the 852,000 members of America's 
second-largest teachers union will take part in the national confab through 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Up for discussion are a number of hot-button educational issues, including 
school violence, professional teaching standards and charter schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to see a lot of discussion around . . . educational reforms and 
setting standards," said Mary Bergan, vice president of the AFT. "This is an 
opportunity for people to come together and to not just debate issues but to 
share what is happening in their states. We want to find the commonality." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the annual gathering, the union will debate and set future policy 
by voting on resolutions that will guide its lobbying activities at the local, 
state and federal level. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the federation plans to release its study of nationwide efforts to 
move large numbers of disabled students into regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The study surveyed 400 teachers at schools that either have inclusion programs 
or are developing them. The survey asked teachers to assess the effectiveness 
of the programs and to comment on whether inclusion efforts should be expanded, 
said AFT spokeswoman Janet Bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other issues to be addressed at the convention: 
</P>
<P>
 * The privatization of public schools. Privatization is being tried in several 
cities across the country, where entrepreneurs are assuming responsibility for 
operating the school systems or individual schools in an effort to run them 
more efficiently than do public school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charter schools, a concept that gives teachers, parents and administrators 
at each school increased powers to set rules, curricula and academic standards. 
Santiago Middle School in Orange is slated to become the county's first charter 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improving education opportunities for students who don't want to go to 
college to help them find quality jobs after high school graduation. Claude 
Duncan, the AFT's public affairs director, said the issue is important because 
it affects "a majority of the kids in public education." 
</P>
<P>
 "The country is still stuck in the 1950s on this issue," he said. We haven't 
gone beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 Delegates will also attend workshops on a variety of issues ranging from 
health care reform to human rights. Richard Trumka, president of the United 
Mine Workers, will give a talk Tuesday on labor law reform. 
</P>

CONCERN ABOUT GANGS, CRIME UP MARKEDLY, POLL SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAIME ABDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gangs and drugs are an increasing worry for a majority of Orange County 
residents, who feel that providing alternative activities in the community 
would help reduce the nearly 300 gangs, according to survey results released 
Thursday by an anti-drug group. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which was conducted in May for the nonprofit group Drug Use is Life 
Abuse, focused on determining the attitudes of Orange County residents on the 
issues of drug abuse, gangs and youth violence. It also asked about possible 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The third annual survey was conducted by UC Irvine professor and pollster Mark 
Baldassare. He announced the results Thursday in a press conference at the law 
enforcement booth at the Orange County Fair attend by about 25 police and 
sheriff's officials from throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were released against a backdrop of increasing crime and gang 
violence in Orange County. Last year, gang-related homicides soared to a 
record-high 74. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the people polled said they view drug abuse as a major 
factor in street crimes, while only a third said it contributed to child abuse, 
according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 When residents were asked to rate the seriousness of six different issues, 
including crime and gangs, drug abuse and jobs and the economy, crime and gangs 
lead but drug abuse is not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime and gangs topped the list even more so than the number of jobs and the 
economy," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the residents called crime and gangs a "big problem," a marked 
increase from two years ago, when less than half the residents ranked the 
problems that seriously. Health care for the poor, the homeless and quality of 
public schools trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although drug abuse ranked second in concern, fewer parents are talking to 
their children about drugs and informing them of the dangers, the survey shows. 
The number declined by 18 points in the past two years from 71% to 53%. Also, a 
lower percentage of parents are concerned that their children will experiment 
with drugs, from 68% in 1992 to 64%.  
</P>
<P>
 But almost all parents believe their children's schools should provide drug 
education programs. Most parents said the programs also should involve 
community groups and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswoman Marilyn MacDougall said law enforcement agencies use the annual 
survey to learn the needs of the community.  
</P>
<P>
 "This year (the survey) showed us people want more education not only in the 
schools but in the workplace," MacDougall said. "We always want to do a little 
more, stretch our funds and hope to reach as many kids as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Six hundred county residents participated in the random telephone survey, 
which was conducted May 19-22. The margin of error is plus or minus 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey follow's April's release of crime statistics that showed 
gang-related homicides soared 72% from 1992. The total number of violent 
gang-related crimes, including homicides, robberies and assaults prosecuted in 
the county, also set a record: 25% more than 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in violent crimes parallels the growing gang population, which 
totals 16,866 gang members in 293 gangs throughout the county, double the 
number of gang members in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 As for solving the problem, eight out of 10 residents said that alternative 
activities for adolescents, such as community sports or other clubs, would 
limit the growing gang population. Residents also said gang prevention 
education should not be limited to just children but expanded to include 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said it is good to hear that people are looking for solutions 
instead of only acknowledging the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an increased awareness over what needs to be done," he said. "There 
is a solution to the gang problem -- education." The Big Problem 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, gangs and drug abuse rate as the major problems facing Orange County. 
Here's how residents rate the "big problem": Crime and gangs: 67% Drug abuse: 
59% Jobs and economy: 51% Health care for the poor: 39% Homelessness: 34% 
Public school quality: 23%

POLICE SAY JULY 4 TAPE MAY BE EVIDENCE AGAINST ITS OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police said Thursday that they located a videotape confiscated from a 
bicyclist July 4 and may use it as evidence to seek criminal charges against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach spokesman Michael Corcoran said police believe that the tape 
may show that the owner, Michael W. Thayer, three times ignored police orders 
to leave the scene when they were trying to control crowds during the nighttime 
melee near the downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to disperse, Corcoran said, is a misdemeanor punishable with a fine or 
jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thayer, 21, said that on July 5, he contacted the Police Department to ask for 
his tape and was told by someone in the property division that there was no 
record of it. That police now might use it to seek charges against him, he 
said, "is ridiculous. . . . I can't believe they are doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 Thayer, a Huntington Beach resident, said he pedaled his bicycle through the 
city with a camcorder attached to the helmet he wore with the intention of 
documenting the holiday celebration.  
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said police hope that the audio portion of the tape will prove that 
Thayer ignored police warnings. But Thayer contends that he did not break the 
law. He acknowledges, however, that he attended a party that police broke up, 
sending party-goers home, and that he lingered in the area longer than police 
wanted because he was waiting for his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, he said, police stopped and took his tape when he was 
riding to a friend's home through an area that had just been cleared of 
revelers. Thayer said he called the Police Department the next day in search of 
the tape but several police officers said they knew nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said that police concentrated on arresting the most violent offenders 
but wrote down information about others, such as Thayer, who might be charged 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Police located Thayer's tape Thursday afternoon, Corcoran said, after a report 
about Thayer's July 4 encounters with law enforcement came to the attention of 
a detective who recognized Thayer as the man who wanted his tape. The tape is 
being held in the Police Department's property division, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said police aren't exactly sure what is on the tape, since they don't 
yet have access to the equipment needed to play it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thayer, who was planning to file a formal complaint about his tape being 
confiscated, said he is baffled about the turn of events.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how they can use it against me without my permission," he said. 
"I'm definitely going to get some legal help tomorrow. This is getting way out 
of hand. All I want is my tape back." 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran said Thayer can be assured he will get his tape back, after police 
make a copy.

TROUBLE IN ANTI-CRIME PARADISE; AS IMPLEMENTATION OF 'THREE STRIKES' LAW 
BEGINS, THE STATUTE'S DEFECTS ARE EVER MORE OBVIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Legislature passed the "three strikes and you're out" law in March by a 
wide margin and with lightning speed. The abduction and murder of 12-year-old 
Polly Klaas, allegedly by a man with a string of felony convictions, gave the 
bill popular appeal and legislative momentum unprecedented even for a crime 
bill. But obscured in the rush to passage were serious concerns, now 
resurfacing. 
</P>
<P>
 The law mandates life imprisonment for individuals convicted of a third 
felony. Its backers were justifiably outraged that the criminal justice system 
had allowed repeat felons, including rapists and murderers, to go free. This 
law, they argued persuasively, would lock the revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
 During the bill's fast trip to Gov. Pete Wilson's desk, opponents -- no less 
anxious to reduce crime -- raised equally valid concerns. Was the law drawn too 
broadly, imposing unduly harsh punishment on nonviolent offenders and 
juveniles? Could it indeed be implemented? Were there enough prosecutors, 
enough judges to hear the many jury trials likely to result? Could we finance 
construction of the prisons needed to house the repeat felons for life?  
</P>
<P>
 Those questions and others now loom large as the first felons charged with a 
"third strike" come to trial. Consider:  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps half of the several hundred affected defendants across the state are 
charged with a so-called "wobbler" offense. These are crimes such as petty 
theft or second-degree burglary that can be prosecuted as either misdemeanors 
or felonies, depending in part on what the judge decides. Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren has moved to limit the judicial discretion in order to bring more 
"wobblers" as felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Barbara judge who recently reduced to misdemeanors two felony charges 
against a man with two "strikes" on his record took the occasion to rail 
against law, calling it "a piece of junk." Prosecutors are now appealing her 
ruling, in part because of those comments. 
</P>
<P>
 That judge's opposition -- if not the vociferousness of her remarks -- 
reflects the views of many trial judges and even prosecutors. Opposition 
extends to some crime victims as well. Because a conviction would have been the 
defendant's third "strike," a San Francisco woman refused to testify at a 
hearing in April for the man accused of stealing her car. Since the prior 
convictions were for residential and auto burglary, she opposed the law's 
application.  
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature can -- and should -- fix the defects now apparent in this law 
by, for example, narrowing its application to violent crimes. But Californians 
should take note: If voters pass the "three-strikes" initiative that is on the 
November ballot -- a measure virtually identical to the statute -- the law will 
become part of the state Constitution, defects and all. Correction then will be 
far more difficult, which is why that currently popular measure should be 
defeated.

BICYCLIST HELD IN SOUTH BAY BURGLARIES; CRIME: SUSPECT USED AN OLD BIKE IN HIS 
GETAWAYS, POLICE ALLEGE. HE IS CHARGED IN THEFTS FROM MORE THAN 60 HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not the most glamorous of getaways, but Torrance police say a 
dilapidated, single-speed bicycle was the vehicle of choice for a South Bay man 
who allegedly burglarized more than 60 homes and pedaled away with nearly 
$55,000 in merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Tom Joseph Freeman, 29, this week after he allegedly forced 
his way into a Torrance house under renovation and left with a portable air 
compressor, a router, a drill and cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We arrested a serial burglar a couple of months ago who rode buses," Sgt. Dan 
Williams said. "They take all forms." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman is suspected of burglarizing about 30 homes in Torrance and another 30 
homes in Redondo Beach, stealing goods ranging from bicycles to boombox radios. 
He apparently lived with friends in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Freeman rode around the towns on his black beach bicycle, eluding 
detectives for several months before he was identified as a suspect last week. 
Without providing details, officers said their investigation was helped by 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just looked like your normal guy riding down the street," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman has admitted burglarizing several homes in the South Bay, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 They suspect he used the bicycle to burglarize houses near the hilly, secluded 
bridle path portion of Torrance and Palos Verdes, where a bicycle would 
facilitate getaways along the narrow, dirt paths that run between homes, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, police trailed Freeman as he pedaled his cruiser to a Torrance 
house, where he put the bicycle into a red Toyota pickup truck and drove with 
another man through Torrance neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watched them cruise up and down three or four blocks, casing it out," 
Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 While the driver, Steven Kenneth Cottey, 23, of Redondo Beach, waited in the 
truck near the 2700 block of Clarellen Street, Freeman forced open a window and 
later emerged with the tools and cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police pulled over the truck and arrested the two men. A compact disc player 
stolen from a Redondo Beach home was found in the pickup, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Freeman occasionally used cars to commit burglaries. 
</P>

COURT REJECTS APPEAL OF RULES FOR LIQUOR STORES; GOVERNMENT: OWNERS OF 
SOUTH-CENTRAL BUSINESSES DESTROYED IN 1992 RIOTING HAD ARGUED THAT CITY-IMPOSED 
CONDITIONS FOR REOPENING WERE UNFAIR.

 To the distress of Korean American shopkeepers in South-Central Los Angeles, a 
raft of controversial city restrictions imposed on liquor stores after the 1992 
riots withstood a state Supreme Court challenge Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an order opposed by two of the court's seven members, the high court 
rejected a challenge that had been mounted by a group of Korean American store 
owners and a public interest group. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopkeepers -- required after the riots to take measures ranging from 
graffiti cleanup to hiring full-time security guards -- had argued that the 
city's conditions were so expensive to implement that only half a dozen of 175 
Korean-owned stores that had been licensed to sell liquor were able to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, they expressed bitter disappointment at the decision, which 
effectively exhausted their alternatives for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is justice? This is like a second riot -- this time in the hands of the 
highest judges of the state," said Sung Ho Joo, whose South-Central liquor 
store was burned to the ground April 29, the first night of the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should like to ask the judges in their lofty places to come down and see 
how much suffering we are enduring through no fault of our own," said Joo, who 
stepped down as president of the Korean American Grocers Victims Assn. earlier 
this year because of poor health stemming from riot-related tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials countered that the new restrictions were necessary to 
control the safety and health hazards that had cropped up near liquor stores 
before the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an acknowledgment that the city has been fair and has been acting in 
the best interest of the city and its communities," said Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, who has worked to reduce the number of inner-city liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also a vindication of the position that hundreds of neighborhood 
activists, churches and others have taken -- that there must be more local 
oversight of liquor stores in South Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed last year by three shopkeepers whose liquor stores had been 
destroyed in the riots. Soo Chun Cha, David Kim and Daniel Whang, along with 
the nonprofit Korean-American Legal Advocacy Foundation, had taken the city to 
court after the City Council passed a resolution blaming health and safety 
problems in South-Central on an "inordinate" number of liquor stores there. 
</P>
<P>
 At the behest of many of the area's mostly black and Latino residents -- who 
complained that easy access to alcohol in the area had fueled crime and 
antisocial behavior -- the city issued a requirement that the owners of liquor 
stores that had been destroyed or badly damaged in the riots obtain new permits 
before reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which almost exclusively affected "mom-and-pop" Korean American 
enterprises, meant that the store owners had to invest in substantial 
improvements in store security and sanitation. New requirements for garbage 
removal and lighting were imposed, along with limits on business hours in some 
locations, and a mandate that the new stores pay for full-time, licensed 
security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit argued that the new permits were overly burdensome, and that the 
city had gone beyond its jurisdiction in trying to regulate liquor sales, which 
are under the purview of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But a state appeals court ruled in the city's favor in March, saying that the 
permits were aimed only at controlling undesirable conditions near the liquor 
stores, not at any prohibition of liquor sales. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the owners' request for an appeal of that ruling was denied a 
hearing. Only Justices Stanley Mosk and Armand Arabian voted in favor of a 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen L. Jones, a lawyer for the Korean-American Legal Advocacy Foundation, 
said the high court appeal was the owners' last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that this was not only an important issue, but we were correct on 
the issue," Jones said. "This is a very sad day for so many people who are left 
without any legal recourse." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, even those store owners who have switched to new businesses said 
they felt wronged. Many said they would be delighted to leave South-Central but 
want compensation for their loss of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe the court has done this to the riot victims," said Young Soon 
Han, whose Crenshaw district market was set afire by rioters. 
</P>
<P>
 Han said she was trying to forget the riots and move on with her life, now 
that she has started a sandwich shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "But these people won't let me forget," she said. "They keep kicking us -- 
even as we try to get up."

GOODBY TO A BARGAIN; SOME BLUE LINE RIDERS SEE RED AS MTA ANNOUNCES BIG FARE 
INCREASES 
</P>

 For the past four years, one of the best transit deals in Los Angeles has been 
a ride on the Blue Line trolley. A one-way trip from Long Beach to Downtown Los 
Angeles set you back just $1.10 -- even less if you used a monthly pass. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that will change Sept. 1, when a new fare system adopted by the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares from Long Beach to Downtown will more than double, to $2.35, and general 
monthly passes will no longer be available, which could cause transportation 
bills for some commuters to balloon even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already too high as it is," complained Rickey Hargrove, as he trundled 
home to Long Beach on Thursday from his job as a security guard for a Downtown 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But he shook his head in resignation. "I gotta do it. You can't fly to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The increase is part of the MTA's attempt to get rid of a $126-million 
operating deficit. On Wednesday, agency officials narrowly approved a new fare 
structure that will hike the price of bus and train rides. For bus riders, it 
was the first increase in six years, climbing from $1.10 to $1.35. 
</P>
<P>
 With a higher base fare of $1.35 and new surcharges based on distance, Blue 
Line riders will have to shell out up to $1.25 more for every ride they take. 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to make some riders look at freeways with fresh eyes, whatever 
environmental concerns they might have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't own a car," said Tara Wolfe, who takes a bus from Pasadena and then 
the Blue Line to work at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. "This may 
force me to save money for one." 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials defend the zoned price structure, calling it an equitable way to 
share the pain of fare hikes between bus and light rail riders. (The same zoned 
price structure will apply on the Norwalk-to-El Segundo Green Line trolley 
system scheduled to open next year.) Officials note that the average trip 
aboard a bus is only four miles, whereas the average Blue Line rider travels 
nine miles. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA spokeswoman Andrea Greene acknowledged that the agency expects Blue Line 
ridership to drop, possibly by as much as 20% from the current daily total of 
37,800 boardings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned, but there's not much we can do," she said. "There will 
be a 56% increase in the amount of revenue we will see on the Blue Line, which 
is good news." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, whose district includes much of the 
Blue Line, has directed the MTA to submit bimonthly reports on ridership to 
gauge the impact of the higher fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of the Blue Line is to stop the traffic congestion," he 
said. He said he hopes the fare increase will not deter riders from sticking 
with the Blue Line.  
</P>
<P>
 Many Blue Line riders now take advantage of the $42 regular monthly pass, 
which allows unlimited use of the trolleys, MTA buses and the Red Line subway. 
Beginning in September, passes will be available only to students, the elderly 
and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that riders accustomed to getting from door to door on different 
kinds of transit will have to pay for each transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a Long Beach commuter who takes a bus from home to the Blue Line 
station, rides to Downtown, then hops onto the subway to the office could pay 
as much as $2.85 ($1.35 for the bus fare, 25 cents to transfer to the Blue 
Line, $1 to cross two zone boundaries and another 25 cents to ride the Red 
Line). Using a 90-cent bus token would only reduce the amount to $2.40. 
</P>
<P>
 That means a daily round trip between $4.80 and $5.70, or up to $120 for a 
working month -- 2 1/2 times the cost of a monthly pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding?" Wolfe asked. "I can get someone from my neighborhood to 
drive me (to work) for $5." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Brown of Compton has taken the Blue Line to visit his mother in Long 
Beach ever since the system opened in July, 1990. But the new fare may keep him 
from fulfilling his filial duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a poor man," said Brown, who is unemployed. "I live on a budget, and I 
can't afford it. Every time they have a budget cut . . . it hurts the ones who 
are out there trying to make it day to day." Bus Route Cuts To save money, the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority will cut back or cancel some lesser-used 
bus lines starting in October. Only two San Fernando Valley routes are 
affected: Source: Metropolitan Transportation Authority

COUNTY BUDGET IS APPROVED; FINANCES: PLAN STAVES OFF POSSIBLY SEVERE PROGRAM 
CUTBACKS UNTIL SEPTEMBER, WHEN QUESTION OF HEALTH FUNDS TRANSFER WILL BE 
DECIDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, in a whirlwind session Thursday, 
approved a $14.5-billion budget that essentially maintains services for now and 
postpones until September decisions on potentially severe cuts in law 
enforcement and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The board decided to tackle this year's budget in two phases because of 
pending legislation in Sacramento that would allow the county to transfer 
millions of dollars in health funds to other county departments and thus avoid 
deep cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is a gamble because the transfer depends on winning agreements 
with both state and federal authorities. If the transfer is not allowed, the 
county will be forced to return to the table and make an additional $168 
million in cuts, much of it from public safety agencies such as the probation 
and sheriff's departments and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors were willing to take that chance to avoid painful reductions that 
would have meant immediate closure of parks, hospitals, libraries, museums and 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing the best we can with limited resources," said board Chairwoman 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. "It's not the best approach or the ideal approach, but 
it is the best we can do under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the budget relies on hundreds of millions of dollars of one-time 
revenues to pay for continuing programs. Chief Administrative Officer Sally 
Reed had hoped to move away from the practice of dipping into special accounts, 
such as emergency assistance funds, to finance county departments because it 
does not solve the long-term problems. In addition, the board's actions left 
the county with a relatively small reserve of $52 million for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board showed restraint today," Reed said. "Clearly, they were 
trying to maintain almost all services until we find out about the (transfer). 
It's a big gamble, with the consequences that in September there will be issues 
that will require serious action from them." 
</P>
<P>
 The sum of Thursday's board actions were $57 million in cuts that include: 
</P>
<P>
 * $1.9 million from mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
 * $3.2 million from the assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * $4 million from the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * $4 million from the Department of Public Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 * $2.8 million from the Beaches and Harbors Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * $15 million from the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 * $12 million from the Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most of those cuts will be accomplished through reducing 
administrative overhead and are not expected to result in elimination of 
services. The cuts approved Thursday were far less than those originally 
proposed by Reed. In May, she asked all department heads to prepare for 
across-the-board cuts of 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flurry of motions, the board dipped into various discretionary funds to 
reduce those proposed cuts by millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget outlook brightened when county officials were notified this week 
that they would receive $31.7 million more in property taxes than they had 
expected. That and other reserves gave the board a pool of about $53 million 
that could be used to plug holes in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients of the largess included the assessor's office, which had $6.8 
million restored to its budget.  
</P>
<P>
 Other restorations included: 
</P>
<P>
 * $500,000 to finance the purchase of reference materials and books for county 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 * $250,000 for the Department of Public Works to fund anti-graffiti programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * $273,000 for the Music and Performing Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 * $500,000 for the Beaches and Harbors Department to fund beach maintenance 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county remains in a precarious position. To make up the remaining 
shortfall, the county is asking the federal government to pay $780 million in 
Medi-Cal reimbursements owed to the county Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have provided no assurance that the funds will be released. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county gets the money, about $600 million of it would be used to 
maintain current levels of care in the Department of Health Services. The 
county will seek support for legislation that would allow it to use the 
remaining funds for other departments.  
</P>
<P>
 Reed said the county will pursue that request when the Legislature reconvenes 
in August. However, that move is likely to draw opposition from health care 
advocates who want the money to remain in the health department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely oppose using that money for non-health purposes," said Melinda 
Bird, an attorney with the Western Center on Law and Poverty. "The (funding) 
problems are not going to magically end this year. I would hate to be talking 
to you a year from now about having to close County-USC Hospital or Martin 
Luther King/Drew Medical Center or another major hospital because $200 million 
was taken away from health services this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Health Services Director Robert C. Gates agreed that his department could face 
shortfalls again next year if the transfer is approved. But he said he will 
support the board's attempt to divert health care funds for use in other 
departments this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is, do you use those available funds to keep the entire county 
whole one more year in the hopes of finding additional revenue sources?" he 
said. "We will do what we are able to do to convince the advocates that the 
overall county interests are served by using this money where it is needed."

'PARENTING SEPARATELY TOGETHER'; DIVORCE: MIXING LEGAL BASICS AND GROUP 
THERAPY, COURT PROGRAM HELPS DIVIDED COUPLES PUT CHILDREN'S INTERESTS FIRST.

 When Sheri Rodino left her husband, she walked out not just on him but on 
their two young children. 
</P>
<P>
 She made the young ones, 3-year-old Jessica and 2-year-old Sean, a promise. 
She said she would call every night before they went to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there were times I slacked it," the 22-year-old Canyon Country woman said 
one night this week at the Van Nuys Courthouse. "That hurt them. They'd say, 
'Don't you love us, Mommy?' or, 'Aren't we important anymore, Mommy?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, because of this program, I know better. If I promise them something, I 
need to start doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of her divorce, Rodino was ordered to complete a two-part, 
court-sponsored program aimed at teaching divorcing and separating couples to 
get over their own anger, hurt and betrayal -- for the good of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The program -- dubbed Parents and Children Together -- is a four-hour mix of 
legal basics and group therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone seeking any kind of court order in any dissolution, separation or 
paternity case in either of the San Fernando Valley's superior courts -- Van 
Nuys or San Fernando -- is required to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not too much to expect -- when you've parented little children, brought 
them into the world or are the parents even of teen-agers, adolescents -- that 
four hours of your time be put into the process," said Robert M. Letteau, 
supervising judge of the Van Nuys court. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if even half of the people understand any part of this, it has to be 
terribly positive for them and the system," said Letteau, who pushed hard to 
expand the program into the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50% of all family law cases in Los Angeles County involve children. In 
Santa Monica, where the program began two years ago at the urging of Superior 
Court Judge David Rothman, they are a factor in about 950 of 1,900 cases 
annually. Court officials expect the program to expand dramatically in Valley 
courts, where about 5,700 family law cases were filed in fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is mandatory and costs $20, which goes to the county's general 
fund, participants in the Santa Monica court program consistently rated it time 
well-spent, according to surveys on file with court officials. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fees it collects and a great deal of volunteer labor, the program is 
self-supporting. It also received a $3,500 start-up grant from the Valley 
Community Legal Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Letteau was so impressed with what he heard about the Santa Monica program 
that he spearheaded the drive to bring the program to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "My initial reaction was that it was just putting the lawyers through one more 
hurdle, and for the participants, it was akin to traffic court, just creating 
more misery and pain. But it really turns out to be something wonderful," 
Letteau said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of the two sessions is largely devoted to the court process, how it 
works and what divorcing parents can expect. "The whole point is that the judge 
is there not for the divorcees but to decide the best interests of the 
children," said participant Lesa Soman, 35, of Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 The second session is about guidelines for "parenting separately together," 
said Santa Monica psychotherapist Judy Goldman, one of the counselors at the 
Van Nuys Courthouse on Tuesday evening. "We may want the other parent to 
disappear, but that is not necessarily how a child may feel," she reminded all 
56 participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, Goldman said, is for the grown-ups to go from being intimate 
partners to an arrangement that's far more businesslike. Such as: 
</P>
<P>
 Don't ask an ex-spouse personal questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't fixate on blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Do act like a guest in the ex-spouse's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Be on time for visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Make it a point, she said, to have separate "meaningful relationships" with 
the kids. Most importantly, talk to each other directly, not through the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "What miracle makes this work?" a man shouted from the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "This all takes two people," he said. "If people were doing these things 
you're talking about, why would they be getting a divorce in the first place?" 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no miracle and there's no magic," Goldman responded. "It takes hard, 
hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's right and she's right," Rodino said. "Basically, it does have to be two 
parties. But the kids are the most important thing -- if you want them to be."

UCLA CHANCELLOR DEFENDS COSTLY EVENT; FINANCES: HE TELLS REGENTS THE $560,000 
SPENT FOR 75TH ANNIVERSARY GAINED VALUABLE PUBLICITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a detailed and sometimes passionate defense, UCLA Chancellor Charles E. 
Young told a UC Regents committee Thursday that the $560,000 spent on a May 
convocation for the school's 75th anniversary was not excessive but a "good 
investment" that lifted morale, invigorated donors and generated valuable free 
national publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Young argued that even in the state's tough budgetary times, the pressure to 
"hunker down and do nothing" rather than pay for such inspiring events would 
mean the "slow death of the University of California." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I would rather see it have its head cut off than to see it starved into a 
situation where it dies slowly and dies ignobly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young appeared before the educational policy committee in response to 
criticism from two key regents about the cost of the May 20 extravaganza that 
featured President Clinton as the keynote speaker before 9,000 students, 
faculty and UCLA supporters at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the event, which was three years in the planning, ended up costing 
$136,000 more than expected because Clinton's appearance required expensive 
last-minute changes such as switching the location of the custom stage from the 
west to the south side of the indoor arena. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA officials have emphasized that Young will pay for the event from private 
sources under his control -- about 20 endowments and interest earned on parking 
fees and other university revenues. On Thursday the chancellor said the money 
came from funds that could have been spent on other university purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the event has paid off in national media coverage worth $660,000 in 
newspaper space and air time if the school had taken out ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Several regents enthusiastically backed Young, declaring the half-million 
dollars "money well spent" for an eye-catching, "electric" event that impressed 
upon a new generation of Californians that the university system is important 
to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to condition the public both rationally and emotionally," said regent 
Peter Preuss of San Diego, "and this event was an event that emotionally 
conditioned the public that our institution is something that is vibrant, 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Regent S. Sue Johnson of Riverside, who attended the UCLA convocation, said: 
"Cecil B. DeMille himself couldn't have done it better. It was an absolutely 
magnificent moment in the history of the university." 
</P>
<P>
 But Young's critics among the regents continued to question the wisdom of 
spending so much on a event while the state continues to be mired in budgetary 
problems. Regent Ward Connerly of Sacramento cited deep spending cuts in 
welfare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to make some brutal cuts in this state in recent years so the idea 
of giving a $575,000 party did not set well with me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Connerly said the bill from UCLA's convocation poses a public relations 
dilemma in Sacramento, where regents have expended "political capital" to 
convince lawmakers "to pony up every dollar they can to help this great 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
 "It taxes credibility then for us to turn around and say, well, we've got 
these little cookie jars here that we can take $560,000 from,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regents Chairman Howard H. Leach of San Francisco agreed. "In normal times, I 
think it would have been a fine investment. But these are difficult times. We 
might have had a very successful event with perhaps less expenditure." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Thursday, the educational policy committee capped a 
months-long academic struggle over downsizing several professional schools at 
UCLA by approving a plan to disband three graduate schools to cut 
administrative costs by $7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan does away with the graduate schools of library and information 
science, social welfare, and architecture and urban planning, but combines some 
remnants into a new school of public policy and social research. In all, it 
reduces the number of professional schools at UCLA from 13 to 11.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CLAREMONT; HARVEY MUDD 
ANNOUNCES RAISING $75.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harvey Mudd College has announced that its five-year capital campaign raised 
nearly $75.5 million -- $5.5 million above its goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign raised about $120,000 per student.Harvey Mudd College has 630 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely gratified to have met, and exceeded, our goal," said college 
President Henry E. Riggs. "Five years ago, we initiated a major effort to 
expand the college's curriculum, increase the number of faculty, enroll more 
students and build new facilities. To achieve those ambitious goals required an 
ambitious fund-raising campaign."  
</P>
<P>
 Planning for the campaign began in 1989, but the major, public fund-raising 
effort was not kicked off until 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the campaign, the college added two new majors, biology and 
computer science. The college also hired 17 more faculty members, increased 
enrollment by 15%, built two academic buildings, added a wing to the Parsons 
Engineering Building, renovated the Jacobs Science Center and built a dorm.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; AUDIT 
FINDS MANY LAPD PROCEDURES ARE STILL LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concluding a two-year series of audits on Los Angeles Police Department 
financial management, the city controller's office reported this week that some 
improvements have been made but that changes are still needed to assure that 
the department protects its assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD, with a $1-billion annual budget, "has in the past assigned a low 
priority to financial management controls," the controller's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the findings of the audits were the theft of $7,400 by a police 
lieutenant from department cash reserves; a property storage room with lax 
security, despite holdings of millions of dollars in cash, artwork and 
narcotics; improper approvals for overtime payments to officers; lax controls 
on citation booklets and failure to obtain reimbursement from the state and 
other police agencies for special police training. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of those problems have been corrected, Controller Rick Tuttle's 
report expressed continuing concern over "access to secured areas where 
evidence for criminal cases is maintained." Tuttle also said the Police 
Department has not reviewed traffic citation books. And it also has failed to 
make timely billings to other departments that receive training from LAPD 
officers or to the state for reimbursement for advanced police training 
sessions.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DIAMOND BAR; 400 POUNDS 
OF COCAINE SEIZED; SIX ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have seized nearly 400 pounds of cocaine and arrested six men for 
investigation of conspiracy to distribute the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The cocaine, with an estimated street value of $8.5 million, was seized 
Wednesday as Pomona police officers conducted surveillance on men believed to 
be drug traffickers, Sgt. Gary Graham said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were followed to neighboring Diamond Bar, where they switched 
automobiles, convincing officers that the men were conducting a drug deal. 
About 110 pounds of cocaine were found in one of the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Police later obtained a search warrant for a Diamond Bar residence, where 128 
more pounds of cocaine were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested were identified as Roberto Jaramico Nie, 28; Rico Santiago, 37; 
Reynoldo Iriarte Sanchez, 24, and Romon Rangel Rodriguez, 24, all of Sinaloa, 
Mexico; Jose Bravo Mendez, 24, of Tijuana, and Tiburci Iriarte Quintero, 24, of 
Diamond Bar.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; URANGA 
CHALLENGES 2-VOTE LOSS IN COUNCIL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonia Reyes Uranga, whose apparent victory in the Long Beach City Council 
election last month was overturned when the city clerk's office found several 
uncounted ballots, filed an election challenge Thursday in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga, a community activist and former president of the Long Beach Children's 
Museum, said she wants a judge to rule on some questionable ballots that led to 
her two-vote loss to contractor Mike Donelon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole election process was a mess, and I'm hoping the courts can unravel 
it," Uranga said. Officials in the city clerk's office have acknowledged that a 
mistake was made in counting the ballots, but insist that the current tally -- 
2,936 to 2,934 -- is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga's six-vote margin of victory on election night was erased June 22 when 
some uncounted ballots were found during a recount, giving Donelon a one-vote 
win. His lead was increased to two votes after officials decided, during a 
court-ordered inspection July 1, to add eight provisional and absentee ballots 
to the tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon's win in District 7 was certified by the City Council last week, and 
he is scheduled to be sworn in Tuesday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; HOTEL, 
RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES PROTEST WORKING CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of tourism workers, community activists and union organizers staged 
protests Downtown on Thursday to denounce what they call exploitative 
conditions at Los Angeles-area hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Directing actions was Local 11 of the Hotel Employees & Restaurant Employees 
Union, which is engaged in a high-profile campaign to organize area tourism 
workers, mostly immigrants from Mexico and Central America.The union seeks 
higher wages, improved benefits and better job conditions for low-wage workers, 
including room attendants and waiters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other actions, protesters Thursday issued a symbolic "red card" to the 
Sheraton Grande hotel Downtown, which is among the prinicipal targets of 
unionization efforts. (In international soccer, players issued red cards for 
playing dirty face suspension for one or more games.) 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Johnson, a Sheraton spokesman, denied that management had pressured 
workers not to join the union or engaged in any improper activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters later marched past the New Otani Hotel, where the unionization 
fight has sparked confrontations between management and union activists.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
AGREES TO SETTLE 3 SUITS INVOLVING LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council agreed this week to pay $730,000 to settle three 
lawsuits involving the LAPD, including $348,000 to the parents of a burglary 
suspect who died fleeing from police.  
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Jorge Vargas died Dec. 9, 1990, in Lincoln Heights after 
his head struck the curb when an officer tackled him.But Vargas' parents said 
that he died from a blow to the head with a flashlight. A jury decided in favor 
of the plaintiffs, and the city attorney's office recommended paying the 
judgment.  
</P>
<P>
 In another case, Konstance Withers, who sued over alleged mistreatment during 
a traffic stop in 1990, will receive $275,000 to settle a $371,000 judgment 
against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Two officers stopped Withers on Oct. 26, 1990, in the belief that she was 
driving a car that had been reported lost or stolen. Later, police learned the 
report was erroneous. Withers claimed that a policewoman sexually molested her 
during a body search, an allegation the officer denied. The plaintiff also 
alleged that the officer tried to choke her when she resisted getting into a 
police car.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, a $106,796 payout was approved for Detective Lynne Tingirides, who won a 
gender discrimination judgment after she was disciplined more severely than two 
male colleagues for driving drunk while off-duty. Tingirides sued because she 
was not returned to her previous assignment, unlike the two other detectives.

MEMORIAL MESSAGE; TOBACCO SCION R.J. REYNOLDS III, AN EMPHYSEMA VICTIM, IS 
EULOGIZED BY HIS BROTHER, AN ANTI-SMOKING ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was an unusual moment: Anti-cigarette advocates gathered to eulogize an 
heir to the giant R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That was the scene Thursday in Santa Monica as no-smoking crusader Patrick 
Reynolds conducted a memorial service for his half-brother, R.J. Reynolds III. 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds, a 60-year-old grandson and namesake of the cigarette company 
founder, died June 28 of smoking-related emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agreed to disagree about tobacco issues," said Patrick Reynolds, 45, of 
Beverly Hills. "He didn't put me down for what I was doing, and I didn't put 
him down for smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Reynolds shocked his family by divesting himself of tobacco stock, 
quitting smoking and then testifying eight years ago on Capitol Hill in favor 
of a ban on cigarette advertising. Since then he has spent more than half of 
his $2.5-million inheritance on the anti-smoking cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Reynolds said he annually spent Christmas and a week each summer 
in North Carolina with R.J. Reynolds. "I didn't nag my brother about his 
smoking," he said. "Family members shouldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds, who was 60 when he died at his estate in Pinehurst, N.C., will 
be remembered as a poet, horse breeder and philanthropist, Patrick Reynolds 
told about two dozen who attended the service. 
</P>
<P>
 But he admitted that R.J. Reynolds was also "an intensely shy, quiet man who 
avoided the limelight" and "wouldn't have wanted people to know he was sick 
from smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. has had no comment on the death, except to note 
that no Reynolds family member has been connected with the company for several 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Private services were held July 5 in North Carolina. But there was no 
announcement of the death until this week, when Patrick Reynolds disclosed that 
it had been caused by a smoking-related illness. 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds had been a heavy smoker of R.J. Reynolds Co. Winston cigarettes 
until about 1988, Patrick Reynolds said. Thursday's service was staged, he 
said, because "I feel closer to some of the people here in Los Angeles than to 
the ones back in North Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
 "My family doesn't like it very much, but I feel it's the thing to do," he 
added. "The story of R.J. Reynolds dying of smoking will have real impact. I 
believe he's up in heaven now, urging me on and applauding me." 
</P>
<P>
 Other opponents of smoking agreed that it might seem odd for them to 
memorialize an heir to a tobacco company that they claim has contributed to the 
deaths of thousands of smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this man was a victim, too," said Robert Cherno, a member of an 
anti-cigarette group called Doctors Ought to Care.  
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Reynolds, who displayed family snapshots of his half-brother, said the 
death will make him step up his work with his group, Citizens for a Smokefree 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is getting real personal now," he said.

ATTORNEY PLEADS FOR LIFE OF WOMAN WHO PLANNED 2 MURDERS; COURT: MARY ELLEN 
SAMUELS HAD A MIDLIFE CRISIS, THE JURY CONSIDERING THE DEATH PENALTY IS TOLD. 
PROSECUTOR SAYS SHE DESERVES EXECUTION.

<P>
 Imploring a jury to spare his client's life, a defense attorney portrayed Mary 
Ellen Samuels, who masterminded the murders of her husband and another man, as 
a cookie-baking jailhouse "den mother" who should not be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 To the prosecutor, though, Samuels is a remorseless, money-grubbing killer who 
deserves to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the decision whether Samuels lives or dies is in a jury's hands. If the 
jury decides on death, Samuels, 45, would become just the fifth woman among the 
383 murderers on California's Death Row.

<P>
 Samuels, convicted July 1 of two counts of first-degree murder, faces the 
death penalty because the jury found two special circumstances -- that she had 
orchestrated multiple murders and that one of the killings was for financial 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony during her trial, Samuels would have received $30,000 
if her husband divorced her. But with insurance proceeds, his estate ballooned 
to $500,000 when he was slain. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent the insurance money in less than a year -- on a Porsche, a condo in 
Cancun, parties, trips and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, 40, a motion picture camera assistant who worked on the films 
"Lethal Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," was killed Dec. 8, 1988, in his 
Northridge home by an intruder who shot him in the back of the head, firing a 
16-gauge shotgun through a pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months later, James Bernstein, the 27-year-old reputed drug dealer 
suspected in Samuels' death, was beaten, choked and left to die in remote 
Lockwood Canyon in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraying Samuels as a selfish, manipulative predator and "the mastermind of 
two evil plots," Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi told the jury: "I ask you for a 
verdict of death for all the selfish and inhumane decisions she made in her 
life. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, how many bodies does it take? We're 
talking about murder for the sake of the almighty dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Josh Groshan repeatedly pleaded with jurors, "Don't kill 
my client. Don't kill Mary Ellen." Acknowledging that Samuels "did something 
despicable," Groshan said, "Mary Ellen is a woman who lost her way in life. 
Call it a midlife crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Monday, a stream of witnesses has told of Samuels' upbringing and 
background as the defense attempted to portray her in a sympathetic light. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ailing mother, Ellen Gurnick, who was undergoing cancer surgery while the 
lawyers argued Thursday, asked the jury to spare her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a choice for sentence," she said, pondering the alternatives for her 
daughter -- life or death. "I want her to live. I don't want her to die." 
</P>
<P>
 In the courtroom, there were dozens of happy family photos on display, showing 
Samuels at childhood birthday parties and skating outings, as a radiant bride 
marrying on her 21st birthday and as a young mother. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the rosy images would fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Her former husband, Ronnie Lee Jamison, told the jury that he wanted Samuels 
to live, that she had been a loving, understanding, generous spouse during 
their 11 years of marriage -- even though she divorced him and kicked him out 
of the house when he lost his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, under cross-examination, Jamison conceded that Samuels was a compulsive 
liar who gambled and used drugs during their marriage.

THE SCENE: GROUNDS FOR FUN; ORANGE COUNTY FAIR'S LOUD GAMES, WILD RIDES ARE BIG 
DRAW FOR TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "It only comes once a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about catchy phrases. You hear it so much around the Orange County Fair 
that it seems like an official slogan churned out of the media office. 
</P>
<P>
 But the purveyors of this saying are none other than the most savvy of 
fair-goers, those who are truly still kids at heart: teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Though fair officials could only estimate that a "substantial" number of the 
700,000 patrons who will attend over the three-week run will be teens, everyone 
knows what a scene the fair is -- especially on the weekend evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the movies, the beach, the coffeehouse or the front of the local 
7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair is the place to hang right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley High senior Kendra Mayo spent last Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
wandering through the lanes lined with obnoxiously loud games and colorful, 
blinding lights from the rides. The warped, muffled hip-hop vibes shooting out 
of the speakers didn't bug her much. Nor did the difficulty of maneuvering 
through the thick crowd of her peers. She says she'll spend many more evenings 
doing the same until it all ends July 24.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait until this time of the year when I can see people I haven't seen 
in a long time," says the 16-year-old, who'd "probably be at home or some 
party" if the fair weren't in session. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kendra and nine of her gal pals from throughout the county brought 
the party to the Costa Mesa fairgrounds Sunday night to see rap diva Queen 
Latifah on stage. Just about every one of the 8,500 seats available at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre was filled by teens that evening, as well as much of the 
lawn area behind the seats. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably one of the few of the fair's free concerts that will garner such 
an energetic, young crowd; Vikki Carr and Three Dog Night just don't cut it if 
you were born when Gerald Ford was in office. No matter, there's more here than 
a couple of good nights of hip acts.  
</P>
<P>
 "Like the rides," says Trabuco Hills High junior Jasmine Farmand, a member of 
Kendra's entourage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, you've been on so many," interrupts Lili Zandpour, 16, a junior at 
Mission Viejo High School. "Try the guys," she clarifies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true!" screams Jasmine, 16. "It's the guys. And the rides. Oh, and being 
with my friends. I just love being here and not being at home. You know, it's 
only once a year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So is their friend's birthday. Naissan Wesley ("that's spelled like Wesley 
Snipes") turned 17 last Wednesday but waited until Sunday to celebrate. Having 
the fair and Latifah show all wrapped up into one package made it the best 
possible way to party, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The University High senior led her court through a zigzag of open spaces, not 
really going anywhere but apparently in search of something. 
</P>
<P>
 They're handed flyers to upcoming clubs and raves, doled out by 
backpack-wearing teen promoters. A few ladies meet up briefly with friends from 
their schools, before rejoining the pack. They stop and ponder a ride and then 
move on. They stop at the ticket booth, stand in line for a bit, but no one 
actually buys any tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time, I ask Kendra what she hates about the fair. The oily glow 
everyone's skin gets? The bad combination of junk cuisine and queasy rides? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like having to pay $6 for admission, then having to pay for the 
(ride) tickets too. I mean, come on, what are they thinking?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Kendra concedes she will eat the costs just for the thrill of the rides. 
(I'm again reminded about the fair's temporary life and that next year is eons 
away.) Coupons run 60 cents each or 20 for $10, and it takes two to five 
coupons a ride. Anything worth risking your stomach on, of course, takes four 
or five. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a few of them are stopped in their tracks by a girl who just 
came off the Kamikaze ride screaming for a cigarette to tame her nerves. The 
number of cigarettes lit here (though none by the 10 ladies I've joined) is 
enough to make the surgeon general squirm. As for the girl who stopped them, 
they pay little attention to her and keep cruising. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many thousands of teens packing one place once the sun has set, it 
wouldn't be off to assume that problems could flare. Tepid summer evenings 
bring out the wild side in us all, and it's no secret that the probability of 
impulsive acts of aggression decreases with age. 
</P>
<P>
 The official word from the media office is that any potential confrontations 
are snuffed out before they happen. (And anyone -- minor or over 21 -- who 
appears inebriated is swiftly dealt with. Last year there were 34 
alcohol-related arrests, mostly of minors.) 
</P>
<P>
 That's not much different from what several officers of the Orange County 
Sheriff Department say. Their uniformed presence is obvious throughout the 
fairgrounds, but it just about saturates those areas frequented most by youth: 
where the rides and games are. The exhibition halls and kiddie areas are quiet 
as the evening darkens. Apparently no respectable high schooler would be caught 
dead hanging around livestock or checking out homemade quilts, at least not 
without a younger brother or mom. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers, however, seem to know something about having fun. Ranting, 
squealing and playful pushing get little more than a look. 
</P>
<P>
 It's safety without the judging eye of parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there's much to worry about. It's de rigueur to attend in packs, not 
with your significant other. The fair is a big social scene ripe with new 
acquaintances from different schools and different cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Naissan's party alone hails from five high schools. They include sisters, 
friends from elementary school and a couple the birthday girl met at a 
statewide Black Student Union convention. 
</P>
<P>
 It quickly becomes evident from this group, as well as every other, that 
interest in the opposite sex is measured by how long a hello lasts. Somewhere 
along the line, teens have taken up the European custom of hugging or 
cheek-kissing upon introduction. Everyone's doing it. After that, the 
pressure's on whoever made the first move. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the number of gorgeous guys who stop them, Naissan and company keep it 
moving up and down the ride and game lanes with not a moment to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the fair only comes to town once a year.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; BRUSHES WITH THE BOTTLE; TEEN DRINKING IS A 
FORM OF REBELLION OR A NOD TO PEER, CULTURAL PRESSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HAN, Nancy Han will be a junior this fall at Troy High School in 
Fullerton, where this article first appeared in the student newspaper, the 
Oracle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trends have a tendency to sear through our culture, then fade away as quickly 
as they came about. But one trend seems to be entrenched: teen-age drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the attraction? 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're young, you're rebellious and want to try new things," said Troy 
senior Bob, who said he drinks casually every weekend. "I was just a punk 
eighth-grader who wanted to try everything and be different. My friends did it, 
but they didn't (say) 'Hey, do it.' They were just like, 'Do you want some?' I 
wanted to step out of the mold. And in retrospect, it was a good enough reason 
to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob (not his real name) said he doesn't drink alcohol to fit into a peer 
group. Instead, he sees it as a way to rebel against parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over Christmas vacation my relatives were visiting, and I came home around 2 
in the morning," he said. "My mom got really mad at me for coming home late, 
even though I usually got home at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was stupid to change my habits just because my mom wanted to 
make it seem like I was a good little boy for my relatives, (but she changed) 
my curfew to 11 p.m. So the next night I got home on time, but this time I came 
home drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Masa Fukuzawa, a nurse for the chemical dependency program at Kaiser 
Permanente of Orange, said teen-agers often drink to defy rules and regulations 
enforced upon them. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides rebelling against parents, many adolescents are motivated to drink 
because of alcohol advertisements portraying alcohol as a source of fun and 
excitement, according to a representative for Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob earlier said that every time he turns on the television, a provocative 
commercial -- such as one with a woman wearing a leopard print bikini offering 
a beer to a dark, muscular man -- tells him that drinking is nothing but 
pleasurable and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of youths are definitely inclined to follow examples because they 
haven't had a lot of experience to make their own decisions and decide between 
right and wrong. (Advertisements) are not showing the depressed people with 
beers, and they don't show the consequences for drinking," the MADD 
representative said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Troy student said he learned the consequences of alcohol consumption 
the hard way after going to a party where he became "pretty wasted." He said 
that alcohol dulled his reasoning and led him to participate in juvenile 
pranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit a police car (with a water ballon), and a cop (stopped) and got out. 
We picked up another ballon and hit the cop. We wouldn't have done that if we 
had been sober; I mean when you're drunk, all your rational sense goes away and 
you start to act more and more on impulsive urges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student said he learned from the experience, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I'm sober, I've realized that it was more important for me to have 
followed my own ideas rather than listening to other people's ideas. I 
shouldn't have drunk (alcohol) because of others."

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; BRUSHES WITH THE BOTTLE; SARAH SUFFERED 
PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL ABUSE UNTIL SHE ESCAPED ALCOHOLIC MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COREY T. GRIFFIN, Corey T. Griffin will be a junior this fall at Troy High 
School in Fullerton, where this article first appeared in the student 
newspaper, the Oracle.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coming home from school, most teens fret over homework, chores and what's for 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah, however, feared finding her mother drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sarah's mother was intoxicated, she turned violently unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "One afternoon when I came home from school, my mom was on her bed drinking 
pineapple daiquiris. I wanted to get away from her, so I asked my father if I 
could go over to my friend's house to study," said Sarah, a Troy High School 
student who asked that her real name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother obviously overheard, because all of a sudden she burst into our den 
and screamed, 'Why are you going over to her house? What do you think you're 
going to do?' My only reply, as I looked at the computer screen in front of me, 
was that I just wanted to study. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom reacted by throwing (at me) a wine glass that she had been holding. 
She just missed my shoulder by a few inches, and the glass shattered near my 
bare feet," Sarah said. "I was so scared that I was shaking. I ran upstairs, 
closed the door and started crying. It took me a long time to get over it, 
because I couldn't get rid of the fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah is just one of an estimated 10 million children each year who daily face 
an alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 In alcoholic families like Sarah's, physical abuse is usually more common than 
in the general population. And the abuse Sarah suffered did not stop at broken 
wine glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fiddling with the remote control because I was so nervous being around 
my mother when she was drunk. My mother came over and yelled, 'I told you not 
to turn the TV on!' She hit me hard across my head several times, and I was 
crying because it was the first time she had hit me. I just kept repeating, 'I 
didn't turn the TV on. I didn't turn the TV on,' " Sarah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah said she didn't want her friends to know about her mother and her 
drinking, putting more emotional strain on herself in order to preserve her 
friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever the fear and pain became too much for me to bear, I went up to my 
room and cried alone. I kept my feelings bottled up because I feared it would 
be too much for my friends to take, and I didn't want to bring any negative 
emotions into the only good part of my life," Sarah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah said keeping her mother's influence out of her friendships was difficult 
because her mother would never give her any privacy and insisted on staying 
home to keep her eye on Sarah. Her mother even listened in on her telephone 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend Jose, whom I've known since elementary school, and I were talking 
on the phone (and I was) in my room," Sarah said. "I noticed the phone 
connection sounded kind of funny, so I opened my door and walked into my 
mother's room. She was sitting on her bed with the phone next to her. I asked 
her if she had been listening in on my phone calls. She replied, 'I don't like 
that Jose person.' Then I knew she had listened in on my phone call, and I felt 
extremely violated." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sarah's father divorced her mother and gained custody of Sarah, she hoped 
moving away from her mother would free her from her emotional burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to leave my old life behind because my experiences with my mother 
were horrible, and I didn't want it to ruin my life forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started with the cleanest slate possible by going to a new school in a new 
town. Now that I was away from my mother and her alcoholism, I could finally 
start my life."

 The earlier the adoption, the better a child does in adolescence, according to 
a recent study of teens adopted when they were babies. The study casts doubt on 
the belief that adopted teen-agers are more likely to be troubled than others 
their age. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year, $1-million study, described as the largest U.S. study of 
adoptive babies, focused on children who were less than 15 months old when they 
were adopted between 1974 and 1980. About 2,000 members of 715 families were 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "What seems particularly important is how parents deal with adoption," said 
study co-author Peter Benson, a psychologist. "In families that are thriving, 
adoption is a fact of life that is accepted and affirmed, not dwelt on. It's no 
big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 27% of the 881 adopted teens surveyed said being adopted "is a big part 
of how I think of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The study also showed that the adopted teens were slightly less likely to 
engage in "high-risk health behavior," such as substance abuse and early sex.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; 1 IN 4 STUDENTS ARE HEAVY DRINKERS; OTHER 
DRUG USE RISING, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 More than one in four California high school students are heavy drinkers by 
their junior year, and teen use of other drugs is on the rise, according to a 
state study released in June. A survey of 5,655 students in public junior high 
and high schools found fewer youths trying cocaine compared to eight years ago. 
But after declining usage among California teens in the late 1980s, drugs such 
as amphetamines, marijuana and LSD are on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the psychedelic LSD more than doubled among 11th-graders since 1985-86, 
with 12% having tried it at least once in the previous six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, commissioned by the state attorney general's office and the 
Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, was conducted last November through 
February at 100 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey asked seventh-, ninth- and 11th-graders about their use of alcohol 
and a dozen other types of drugs. The margins of error ranged up to plus or 
minus 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attributed increases in drug use, in part, to cutbacks in 
drug-prevention education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 40% of ninth-graders and 36% of 11th-graders surveyed said they had not 
taken an alcohol or drug prevention class in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen drinking has remained relatively stable, but alcohol remains by far the 
most widely used drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found 53.1% of seventh-graders, 68.6% of ninth-graders and 74.3% of 
11th-graders having had at least one drink in the previous six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine percent of high school juniors and 21% of freshmen were classified 
as "excessive alcohol users." That group included those who had consumed five 
or more drinks in a row at least twice in the previous two weeks, had gotten 
very drunk or sick at least three times in their lives, or drank to get drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, 28.1% of 11th-graders and 23% of ninth-graders were described as 
"high-risk drug users" who used marijuana or other drugs frequently, mixed 
their drugs or tried cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Among 11th-graders, 40.6% said they had driven a car after drinking or been in 
a car with friends who were drinking and driving. That was up from 35% four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 30% of 11th-graders, 20% of ninth-graders and 6.5% of seventh-graders 
said they had been high on alcohol or other drugs while at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Among juniors, 41% said they had been very drunk or sick after drinking, 13% 
had passed out and 16% had forgotten what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 After declines in reported drug use in the late 1980s, the survey found 
overall drug use had nearly rebounded to levels observed when the study started 
eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocaine use dropped, but marijuana, inhalants and LSD showed significant 
increases in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Marijuana was the most commonly used drug after alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent of 11th-graders and 30.4% of ninth-graders said they had tried 
marijuana, up from 29.4% and 19.4%, respectively, in 1991-92. Sniffing 
inhalants, such as nitrous oxide or aerosols, nearly doubled to 21.5% of 
ninth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 LSD use increased from 12.2% of 11th-graders and 8.6% of ninth-graders, up 
from 6% and 4.1%, respectively, eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has conducted the student drug and alcohol use survey every other 
year since 1985-86.

 For the serious, hard-core gamer, it's becoming more and more obvious that 
some sort of CD drive is a vital part of the video game experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I've been critical of the Sega CD in the past, dramatic improvements 
in game quality have me close to eating my words, and two new games are adding 
to my dining pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is Microcosm, a strange and unusual disk from Psygnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is long and complicated; 20 pages of the instruction manual are 
gobbled up telling the tale. Basically, you're a top agent for Cybertech, 
reduced to the size of a dust mite and inserted, along with various vehicles 
and weapons, into the body of Cybertech president Tiron Korsby. 
</P>
<P>
 You travel though Korsby's body, trying to find and destroy a manipulation 
device -- Grey M -- buried deep in his brain by the leader of a rival company. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling through veins and arteries, you fire on both natural viruses and the 
artificial probes filling his body to defend the intruding device. Your course 
is predetermined, although you can maneuver your craft along the preset path. 
</P>
<P>
 You use three mechanical aids on your journey. A Spook Series 4 pod is your 
first vehicle. It's used in two sections of the game; the initial battles, in 
the cephalic vein, and the third stage, the superior vena cava and the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Your second vehicle is the Hunter Killer RS-18. You use it in section 2, the 
left lung, and section 4, the carotid artery. 
</P>
<P>
 When you reach the brain, section 5, you are stuffed into the S2-21 pressure 
suit for close-up work. 
</P>
<P>
 Each has a variety of weapons, including lasers, cannons and smart bombs, 
which are upgraded by icons floating throughout the body. You'll need the 
firepower, because the variety of natural and artificial weaponry is awesome. 
</P>
<P>
 As are the graphics. And the dramatic soundtrack, created by former Yes 
keyboard player Rick Wakeman. And the control, which is smooth and fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a continually fascinating and entertaining game, devilishly hard to 
beat. It's Sega-rated MA-13, with parental discretion advised. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sega is responsible for the second CD -- Tomcat Alley. 
</P>
<P>
 In this classic battle for air superiority, you are the radar and missile 
officer aboard an F-14 Tomcat fighter-bomber. You and your companions are 
trying to wipe out two MIG squadrons stolen by renegade Russian Col. Alexi 
Povich and relocated to the Mexican desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomcat Alley gives you a from-the-cockpit view of the action as you punch in 
waypoint coordinates, trigger flares and chaff to throw off enemy missiles, 
handle the radio and recon camera and line up shots at waves of MIGs and SAM 
batteries defending Povich's headquarters and his chemical warfare threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomcat Alley isn't a true flight simulator, since you don't fly the plane. The 
direction pad is used to line up the cross hairs for missile shots at enemy 
planes and to direct bombs and missiles against ground targets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the action is hot and heavy, and the CD, rated MA-13, is crammed with 
variations, so you almost never fight the same fight twice in a row. There are 
excellent, if slightly fuzzy, film sections with live actors, solid sound 
effects and great shots of exploding jets -- MIGs, if you shoot well; your own, 
if you miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomcat Alley missions become more and more complex the closer you get to 
wiping out Povich and his pals. But keep trying. You might get a medal.

SYLMAR MAN ARRESTED IN COLLEGE VANDALISM; CRIME: TELEPHONE OPERATOR, 22, 
BECOMES FIRST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY ADULT TO FACE FELONY GRAFFITI TAGGING 
CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the annals of bumbling San Fernando Valley criminals, Job Matas' name can 
be inscribed among the very elite, if what authorities say about him proves 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Matas became the first adult in the San Fernando Valley to be 
charged with felony graffiti "tagging," after doing $6,000 worth of damage to 
Los Angeles Mission College last March, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Matas, police said, might have gotten away with it, since no one actually saw 
anyone etching the tagger moniker LOST into the glass of dozens of windows and 
mirrors on the campus during class registration sometime the first week of 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for Matas is that months earlier, while doing community service 
work as part of his sentence on an earlier tagging conviction, he boasted to 
others on the work crew that he was the ubiquitous LOST, and the crew 
supervisor passed word along to police, said Los Angeles Police Detective Craig 
Rhudy. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the Mission College vandalism appeared, it was just a matter of 
putting all the information together, Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Police Department's San Fernando Valley-based Community Tagger 
Task Force looked in their files to see if they had any information about LOST. 
There was Mata's name, thanks to his own admission, said Rhudy, the task force 
coordinator. The task force also had Mata's address, because of the misdemeanor 
conviction and because he was on probation for a felony burglary conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old telephone operator was awakened Wednesday morning when 
authorities searched the Sylmar house he shares with his mother and sister. 
Matas was arrested after LAPD and Mission College police officers found 
evidence of tagging, including examples of his work, Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Admitting, when he is on probation, who he was and what his tag was, to a 
work crew, isn't the smartest thing to do," said Capt. Bill Stevens, Mission 
College police chief. "They don't think anyone ever coordinates, but since the 
Tagger Task Force is around, a lot of this stuff is cross-referenced and 
coordinated, when it didn't use to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Matas, who police said never actually attended classes at Mission College, 
told authorities he had been tagging for more than 10 years, since he was in 
seventh grade, said A.J. Rotella, the campus police officer who investigated 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the search at his house, Matas told police he had stopped tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had given it up and was trying to clean up his act," Rotella said, 
"but I guess things are catching up with him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rhudy said task force members have had much success in getting prosecutors to 
file felony charges against juvenile taggers, but that at least three cases in 
which police wanted adults charged with similar felonies were reduced to 
misdemeanors by prosecutors. He said Matas was the first adult to be charged 
with a felony in such a case. 
</P>
<P>
 Matas was in custody Thursday on $35,000 bail. If he is convicted, the parole 
violation count could bring a much stiffer sentence than usual in graffiti 
cases.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably going to go to jail, or state prison," Rhudy said.

DAIRY KING; FAITHFUL MILKMAN COLLECTS SAD FAREWELLS ON FINAL ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Eisenhart was heartbroken last Friday when she read a handwritten note 
she discovered beside her delivery of cheese, certified raw milk and fertilized 
eggs on the front porch of her Woodland Hills home. It read: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Customer, 
</P>
<P>
 Because of health reasons, I am selling my route. I regret that I have to do 
this as I Love my Valued Customers. You have been good to me, and I will miss 
you. My last day is July 15th. Hope you will continue to carry on as good 
customers to the new driver. I will miss you all. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Sherwin" 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very sad," said Eisenhart, who added that she has "a real soft spot" 
for milkmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the days of the Depression, my father was a milkman." 
</P>
<P>
 A little piece of Valley tradition will be lost today as Sherwin, who turns 60 
next month, hands over the keys to his truck and officially retires from the 
milk business. For more than a quarter of a century, Sherwin has delivered 
dairy products to San Fernando Valley residents and small businesses, first 
back in 1962 through the now-vanished Green Pastures Dairy, then on to a slew 
of local dairies, most of which have merged or moved away. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenhart called it "the ending of something wonderful . . . for all of us who 
remember a time of personal service, of knowing your grocery man, your gas 
station man, your milkman." 
</P>
<P>
 With Jan, his wife of 35 years, Sherwin is moving to Florida, and he hasn't 
ruled out starting up another business there. Sherwin admitted that his doctor 
had ordered him to retire years ago, but he didn't want to until now. 
</P>
<P>
 The milkman has witnessed the tides of change in the dairy business: from 
glass bottles to plastic jugs, from the dozen local dairy farms and plants to 
major corporate operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now carry a lot of other things, too," he said, including bread, bacon, 
bologna, ice cream and Popsicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwin said he enjoyed "being kind of free to do what I want" in his last 
stint, as an independent distributor of dairy products through the Alta-Dena 
Certified Dairy in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwin gathered his clientele of nearly 300 customers by knocking on doors, 
carrying a container of milk to show the residents what he delivers. He has 
also earned many referrals. "A lot of people don't know that we still deliver," 
Sherwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 95% of his business is home deliveries, according to Sherwin, with 
the rest doughnut shops and other small stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting his day by 4 a.m. at the latest, Sherwin would pick up his orders at 
the Chatsworth Alta-Dena office by 5 a.m., along with 30 other drivers, then 
head off in his 14-year-old truck to Woodland Hills, West Hills and Bell 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 At several residences, Sherwin was allowed to go right through an unlocked 
back door to put the milk in the refrigerator himself, often bumping into 
family members in their pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwin tells the story of running into one of his customers at a supermarket, 
a woman who usually came to the door in her bathrobe. "I didn't recognize you 
with your clothes on," he joked with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenhart fretted that Sherwin "might be the very last of what most people 
thought was already a vanishing breed, the guy with a milk route." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. Sherwin has sold his decade-old Alta-Dena route to two brothers, 
Bharat and Pankj Patel, but his customers have made it clear that they will 
miss him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are giving me cards and money," said Sherwin. After he announced 
his retirement, "one woman gave me $100, another gave me $50, a bunch of people 
gave me $20. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me that their kids grew up knowing me as their only milkman and 
that I'm part of their family."

JURY DEBATES LIFE OR DEATH FOR SAMUELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imploring the jury "Please don't kill my client," a defense attorney Thursday 
portrayed Mary Ellen Samuels, who masterminded the murders of her husband and 
the hit man, as a cookie-baking jailhouse "den mother" whose life should be 
spared. 
</P>
<P>
 To the prosecutor, though, the 45-year-old grandmother is a remorseless, 
money-grubbing shrew who deserves to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the decision whether the "Green Widow," as prosecutors call her, lives or 
dies is in a jury's hands. If the jury decides on death, Samuels would become 
just the fifth woman to join the 383 murderers on California's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, convicted July 1 of two counts of first-degree murder, faces the 
death penalty because the jury found two special circumstances -- that she had 
orchestrated multiple murders, and that one of the killings was for financial 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony during her trial, Samuels would have received $30,000 
if her husband divorced her. But, with insurance proceeds, his estate ballooned 
to $500,000 when he was slain. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent the insurance money in less than a year -- on a Porsche, a condo in 
Cancun, parties, trips, and custom-made outfits from a store called Trashy 
Lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, 40, a motion picture camera assistant who worked on the films 
"Lethal Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," was killed Dec. 8, 1988, in his 
Northridge home by an intruder who shot him in the back of the head, firing a 
16-gauge shotgun through a pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months later, James Bernstein, the 27-year-old reputed drug dealer 
suspected in Samuels' death, was beaten, strangled and left to die in remote 
Lockwood Canyon in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraying Samuels as a selfish, manipulative "predator" and "the mastermind 
of two evil plots," Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi told the jury: "I ask you 
for a verdict of death for all the selfish and inhumane decisions she made in 
her life. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, how many bodies does it take? We're 
talking about murder for the sake of the almighty dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Josh Groshan repeatedly pleaded with jurors, "Don't kill 
my client. Don't kill Mary Ellen." Acknowledging that Samuels "did something 
despicable," Groshan said, "Mary Ellen is a woman who lost her way in life. 
Call it a midlife crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 He continued: "Can you say she is so without redeeming value that you can say 
to her, 'You deserve to die and I can kill you?' Is she that far gone?" 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, Samuels bowed her head, closed her eyes, and rubbed her forehead 
with her fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi turned the jury's attention to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a representative of the people of the state of California, I will be 
satisfied if you show Mary Ellen Samuels the same sympathy and the same mercy 
she showed Bob Samuels and James Bernstein when she had them killed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi contended that Samuels exploited her ailing parents, Alex and Ellen 
Gurnick, during the penalty phase of the trial by putting them on the witness 
stand "to beg for her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Their appearance for the defense Wednesday led to an emotional courtroom 
reunion that moved courtroom observers to tears. Samuels wept openly during a 
break as she and her mother spoke about "God's will," and she greeted her 
father, "Hi, Daddy. I love you." 
</P>
<P>
 But Maurizi told the jury Samuels had been transformed from the a precious 
little girl into an evil woman. After her husband died, Samuels never sent a 
dime to her parents, who live on a fixed income. She took a boyfriend's father 
to Cancun but never visited her own father in the hospital when he underwent 
bypass surgery, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Bob Samuels' brother and sister wept and shopped for a headstone 
after his murder, "she flew off to Las Vegas and bought a fur coat -- a fake 
one, she would tell you," Maurizi said. "She went to Trashy Lingerie for a 
$1,500 spending spree." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Monday a stream of witnesses told of Samuels' upbringing and background 
as the defense attempted to portray her in a sympathetic light. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to the witness stand Wednesday, Ellen Gurnick, who underwent cancer 
surgery while the lawyers argued Thursday, asked the jury to spare her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a choice for sentence," she said, pondering the alternatives for her 
daughter -- life or death. "I want her to live. I don't want her to die." 
</P>
<P>
 There were dozens of happy family photos on display -- showing Samuels at 
childhood birthday parties and skating outings, as a radiant bride marrying on 
her 21st birthday, and as a young mother. 
</P>
<P>
 There was testimony this week about piano and voice lessons, back yard 
barbecues, and trips to Disneyland, how she won the lead in the senior class 
play, how she taught her step-daughter to bake cookies, how the other inmates 
at Sybil Brand Institute for Women now call her the "den mother." 
</P>
<P>
 And then the rosy images would fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Her former husband, Ronnie Lee Jamison, told the jury he wanted Samuels to 
live, that she had been a loving, understanding, generous spouse during their 
11 years of marriage -- even though she divorced him when he lost his job and 
kicked him out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some bitterness on my behalf, naturally," he testified. "I think 
you should try to make it work no matter how tough it gets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, under cross-examination, Jamison conceded that Samuels was "a 
compulsive liar" who gambled and used drugs during their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurnick recalled her daughter as a "wonderful entertainer and baby-sitter." 
Then this exchange occurred under Maurizi's cross-examination of Gurnick: 
</P>
<P>
 Q: "Did you continue to see Mary Ellen after Bob's death?" 
</P>
<P>
 A: "I don't know. We didn't really. I called her on her birthday but we didn't 
communicate too much because we both were busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did Mary Ellen come to see you and take you for a ride in her new Porsche? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would it surprise you if I told you that Mary Ellen went through over 
$500,000 in cash in less than a year after Bob's death? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It would surprise me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You didn't see any of that cash or receive any benefits from that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; 3 TO HEAD FOR ARCTIC CIRCLE IN '67 VW VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sharing a streak of adventurism and zest for the unknown, three young men are 
planning to leave tonight on a 4,200-mile expedition from Encino to the Arctic 
Circle in a vintage 1967 Volkswagen camper van. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a new car, you're sure you'll make it, but with an old car, the 
challenge is making it," was the explanation given by Matthew Gossin, 25, when 
asked about the group's choice of tour vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 Gossin, Blue Nelson and Jean-Ray Tippo plan to shove off from Nelson's home 
after a bon voyage party attended by an expected 75 friends and family members. 
The trio figures it will take them a week and a half to get to the 66th 
Parallel by way of California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, the Yukon 
Territory, and finally, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nelson, 25, the trip is a chance not only to fulfill his love of exotic 
travel, but also to explore a dimension of his favorite hobby -- restoring 
vintage German cars. He owns 14 Volkswagens, Porsches and German hand-built 
cars in various stages of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "VWs were the most popular vehicles in the '60s," the russet-haired aspiring 
filmmaker said. "It's my duty as an enthusiast to keep that spirit alive on the 
roads."  
</P>
<P>
 Nelson bought the van about a year ago and has been renovating it ever since. 
The car enthusiast claims that the hunter green and white van is one of only 
100 converted by the English company, Dormobile, which was authorized by 
Volkswagen to convert its passenger vans into campers.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1967 model is prized by collectors because it is the only model that has 
both a 12-volt electrical system -- insuring reliability -- and charming 
old-model design features, including a split windshield and double cargo doors, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The top of the van pops up, allowing passengers to walk around unimpeded or to 
set up the two stowed cots. A bench seat converts into a third bed. Other 
features installed by Dormobile include safari windows -- hinged windshields 
that open out -- louvered side windows and a mini-stove tucked into its own 
cabinet.  
</P>
<P>
 In revamping the vehicle, Nelson said, he preserved as many of the original 
features as possible, including the orange-plaid upholstery and the radio. As 
much as possible, he strove to add only those items that would uphold the 
integrity of the van, such as the 1967 dashboard clock and the side-mounted 
Bavarian bud vases. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance for adventure also inspired Gossin, a free-lance film editor who 
lives in Hollywood, and Tippo, 23, a Northridge resident who hopes to begin a 
career as a stockbroker or financial analyst, to make the trip. Tippo is a 
childhood friend of Nelson, and Gossin studied film with Nelson at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest challenge of the trip, Nelson and Gossin predict, will be living 
harmoniously in cramped quarters and through difficult terrain for the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to travel and fly together," Nelson said. "It's another thing 
to chip in when things go wrong, help share cooking duties and live within a 
15-foot-long space." KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 9 STUDENTS TO HELP ARMENIANS REBUILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine Armenian American college students will spend the next six weeks roughing 
it as they help the shattered Armenian republic of Nagorno Karabagh rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, chosen from 30 applicants for the trip, will camp out and eat 
food made by indigenous peoples after 10-hour days filled with hard labor, said 
Stepan Boyajian, chairman of the Armenian Youth Federation in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them you aren't going to Paris or London, you are going somewhere 
where life is tough and they need help," Boyajian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old federation decided to sponsor the journey last fall in an 
effort to help Nagorno Karabagh recover from a six-year civil war between 
Armenians and Azerbaijanis for control of the 1,700-square-mile republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The group includes: Stepan Haytayan Van Nuys, group leader; Dzia Vartabedian, 
Burbank, assistant group leader; Dikran Garabed Encino; Varnp Gurjian, 
Glendale; Sarine Gureghian, Glendale; Rita Garlekian, Pasadena; Tamar Abkarian, 
Studio City; Lela Khajadourian, Burbank, and Viken Sapatijain, Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Each student had to raise roughly half of the $1,800 fee required for travel 
expenses, food and lodging for the trip, Boyajian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will begin its journey in their ancestral homeland by completing 
construction work on a secondary school dormitory in the forested city of 
Shoushi in Karabagh. The building, when completed, will be used to house 
orphaned children from the region. 
</P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; $4.9-MILLION BUDGET CUTS 7 CITY POSITIONS 
</P>

<P>
 After eluding the worst fiscal crunch in the city's 12-year history, the 
Agoura Hills City Council has adopted a budget for the next fiscal year that 
includes laying off seven employees. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting Wednesday night, the council unanimously approved a 
$4.9-million spending plan that shaves $270,000 from last year's budget, 
including the layoffs of two full-time employees and five part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This obviously reduces the levels of service we are able to provide," said 
City Manager Terry Matz. "It means longer processing time for code enforcement 
and fewer planning hours available for the public. We have to try to absorb the 
workload." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also cut employee benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Also eliminated were an after-school recreation program at Yerba Buena 
Elementary School, which cost $11,000, and $7,000 worth of contributions to 
events such as Pony Express Days and the Great Race of Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the budget comes after the city offset most of a $1-million 
projected shortfall next year by approving a tax on the use of electricity, gas 
and telephone service. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE COLLEGE TO ADD 45 NEW CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College will boost its fall schedule with 45 new classes in some of its 
most popular departments, the school's president said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the instructional program ought to be strengthened," said Pierce 
President Mary Lee."If students can't get the requirements for a major, they 
are going to go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The additions come after two years of financial troubles and shrinking 
enrollment that slashed classes at Pierce by 20%. About 200 courses had already 
been dropped from the 1,800 offered last fall. But this week, the 
administration allocated about $130,000 for the new classes after several staff 
members announced their retirement, Lee said. One administrative position and 
one or two teaching positions will not be filled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition will open classes in departments such as biology, chemistry and 
English that have waiting lists up to 50 students long, Lee said, meaning many 
students will be able to register for classes that were previously closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other departments with new classes include math, microbiology, physics, 
physiology, philosophy, economics, horticulture, beginning Spanish, speech, 
anatomy and computer science. SUSAN BYRNES

 The city of Glendale will cap off a series of events designed to attract World 
Cup visitors to the area with a Cruise Night tonight in the city's downtown 
business district. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, featuring a 250-vehicle classic car show and a street concert with 
Dick Dale and Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys, will be held from 6 to 10 p.m. 
along Brand Boulevard between Broadway and California Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect more than 10,000 people to attend the barbecue and concert. 
The free party, with hamburgers and hot dogs grilled by the Jewel City Kiwanis, 
will be hosted by radio station KRTH 101-FM.  
</P>
<P>
 Both bands will be playing for the first time locally after returning from 
national tours. Dick Dale, who has been called the "king of surf guitar," will 
perform songs from his album "Unknown Territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifties rockabilly artists Big Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys will perform 
selections from their album "Jumping From 6 to 6."  
</P>
<P>
 The evening will feature a drawing for a 1994 Harley-Davidson motorcycle to be 
donated by Harley-Davidson of Glendale. Tickets for the drawing can be 
purchased at the street party for $1 each or six tickets for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise Night follows the Country Western Street Party and an 18-mile soccer

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MEDIA URGED TO POOL COPTER NEWS REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consensus appears to be growing among some residents living near Van Nuys 
Airport, law enforcement and the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council 
that the media should practice pool coverage when monitoring news and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea would be to improve helicopter safety and reduce noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The council could send a letter recommending the pool system to the Board of 
Airport Commissioners, which could pass on the recommendation to the Federal 
Aviation Administration -- the only agency with authority to effect change -- 
said Sandor L. Winger, chairman of the council, in a telephone interview on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors' complaints about aircraft noise have plagued the airport for years. 
In the past few months, homeowner activists have proposed altitude minimums for 
helicopters, and distributed leaflets encouraging people to call in noise 
complaints to Van Nuys and Burbank airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The council could also recommend that the board join with the Los Angeles 
Police Department to have the media voluntarily accept pool coverage, Winger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a pool system, one or a small number of news crews would be responsible 
for getting video, news photos or information and distributing it to other 
media organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the council's meeting last week, members appeared willing to take some 
action on the issue. If they are successful, there would be large-scale 
ramifications on media organizations' news-gathering operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Paterson, a member of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn., asked the 
council to pass a motion recommending a helicopter-pool system, and requested 
that it ask the City Council to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love for them to pool," said Capt. Tim McBride, commander of the 
LAPD's air support division. "We are not that far away from a conflagration." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride described a recent incident in which police helicopters were pursuing 
a suspect. When media choppers took up the chase, an LAPD helicopter had to be 
deployed just to control air traffic, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 Media and helicopter companies say they are strongly opposed to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not be willing to be part of a pool situation," said Jeff Wald, news 
director for KCOP Channel 13. "We are all fierce competitors -- we are trying 
to get the best story to our viewers. Even though there may be eight or nine 
helicopters over a chase, our pilots are very professional. They're very used 
to dealing with incidents of this nature."  
</P>
<P>
 Winger said he personally did not believe a pool system would work for traffic 
reporting -- but only during blockbuster news events during which many 
helicopters could be expected to converge on one site. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; TARGET AREA DETAILED FOR REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Details about the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency's proposal to 
create a redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks are beginning to emerge from recent 
community gatherings at which agency officials have presented their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has targeted a prospective redevelopment area that runs along 
Ventura Boulevard from Coldwater Canyon Avenue to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 570-acre area runs as far north as Magnolia Boulevard in one section, and 
in another part, extends as far south as Greenleaf Street -- two blocks south 
of Ventura Boulevard. The proposed study area includes the Sherman Oaks Fashion 
Square mall, as well as sections of Coldwater Canyon, Fulton and Willis 
avenues, among other streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we hope to accomplish is to provide a mechanism, financial and 
otherwise, that will allow Sherman Oaks to rebuild, to recover from the 
earthquake," said Don Spivack, CRA director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the City Council decided to order the CRA to study the feasibility 
of creating emergency redevelopment areas where local property taxes could be 
used to rebuild neighborhoods and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the community meetings, CRA officials have stressed that the 
agency's power to condemn and take over property would not be used on homes 
where people are currently living. It would only be used on buildings which 
have become a public nuisance, and whose property owners are unable -- or 
refuse -- to improve their property after a reasonable period of time, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has also promised not to use its powers of eminent domain to 
assemble parcels of land.  
</P>
<P>
 Money generated from the redevelopment area would go toward repair, 
rehabilitation and reconstruction of quake-damaged residential and commercial 
property. It would also help pay for new housing construction and public 
improvements such as streets and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the CRA will help property owners get financing to rebuild 
quake-damaged buildings. It could do this by giving direct grants and loans or 
by leveraging its money. For example, the CRA could guarantee a bank loan for a 
building owner, or give funds to a person that would trigger matching funds 
from a government agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The money to pay for the project would come from the tax increment, or the 
additional property tax that is generated by the project's improvements to the 
area. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HIV-INFECTED CAN GET POST-QUAKE REFERRALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to aid HIV-infected individuals whose housing was disrupted by 
the Northridge earthquake, an emergency mobility team has been established to 
provide them with housing referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 A project of the Los Angeles Housing Exchange, the mobility team will be set 
up at the three disaster assistance centers in Chatsworth, Sherman Oaks and Van 
Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Most disaster assistance programs are geared toward helping the general 
population. But the Los Angeles Housing Exchange, which coordinates safe 
housing for HIV-infected people in collaboration with AIDS Project Los Angeles, 
has developed the referral project to better address specific needs of people 
with HIV/AIDS in disaster situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Using its database of more than 30,000 housing units (from independent living 
situations to group homes and shelters), the housing exchange can refer clients 
to a variety of temporary and permanent homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency mobility team also will make its resources available to other 
disaster assistance programs that target those who are hard to place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can help anyone with HIV who was affected, even if it's dealing with 
anxiety levels," said Joyce Canham, FEMA consultant to the housing exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Canham gave the example of an HIV-positive man whose damaged apartment was 
green-tagged, but because of his severe allergies to dust from the 
construction, he was moved to another apartment. "It was a dangerous place for 
him to be," said Canham. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the goals of the program is to serve as a prototype for all types of 
disaster assistance to people infected with HIV.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: METROLINK SHUTTLE SERVICE TO CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transit Authority will pick up the cost of two shuttle 
services begun with federal emergency funds in the aftermath of the Northridge 
earthquake, an MTA spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The services, which transport Metrolink riders from the Glendale and San 
Fernando/Sylmar stations to their workplaces in Pasadena and the San Fernando 
Valley, were scheduled to end Sunday when Federal Emergency Management Agency 
funds run out. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a $250,000 pledge Wednesday to fund four existing services including 
the Glendale and Sylmar/San Fernando shuttles, service is likely to continue 
until October, according to Cynthia Pansing of the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board decided to approve a continuation of the feeder services," Pansing 
said. "But it's a short-term solution." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12th Council District Transportation Management Assn. is attempting to 
continue the San Fernando/Sylmar service without interruption on Monday, said 
Aaron Hanson, executive director of the association. But instead of vans, 
commuters will take free taxis to their destinations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most cost-effective way to do it," Hanson said. "We lost a good 
number of people at the beginning of the month." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said an impending hike in Metrolink fares coupled with the threat of 
the shuttles' demise caused nearly 150 riders, about half of those who used the 
San Fernando/Sylmar station, to return to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares that were discounted in the aftermath of the quake will return to normal 
in August when FEMA funding runs out, raising the cost of a monthly pass from 
Lancaster to Sylmar/San Fernando from $80 to $176. SUSAN BYRNES

<P>
 Two youths were arrested Thursday after Los Angeles police discovered an 
explosive device in their car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified boys, a 16-year-old Reseda resident and a 17-year-old from 
Northridge, were stopped by Los Angeles patrol officers, who found an explosive 
device and material for making other devices in the car, said Detective Steven 
Spear. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths later admitted detonating one device in a parking lot, Spear said. 
They led police to a house in the 8100 block of Etiwanda Street, where more 
material used to build the devices was confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths were booked at the Police Department's Devonshire Division on 
suspicion of possession of a destructive device in a public place, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spear said the confiscated device was less powerful than a pipe bomb, which is 
made with steel and, sometimes, plastic pipe and explosive materials. CHIP

GAS COMPANY TO AID QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A grant program sponsored by the Southern California Gas Co. and a number of 
government agencies for victims of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake will be 
available to qualified applicants beginning Monday, not immediately, a gas 
company spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 George McQuade, a spokesman for the utility company, said the Community 
Partnership for Earthquake Repair project will provide loans of up to "several 
thousand dollars" for such minor earthquake repairs as roof, window and door 
damage.Many applicants who saw news reports of the program have been calling 
the gas company before the company was ready to handle applications, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CPR is the utility company's first public/private venture, McQuade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants include the California Department of Economic Opportunities, the 
California Conservation Corps and the Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is designed to provide assistance to residents at or below the 
poverty level and disabled or elderly persons who have been rejected by other 
agencies, McQuade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund currently holds about $5 million, McQuade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualified applicants can call (800) 331-7593, beginning Monday to obtain 
applications.

EX-DEPUTY FACES TRIAL AFTER VIDEOTAPE OF ALLEGED COCAINE DEAL; COURT: 
BELLFLOWER MAN IS ACCUSED OF BUYING THE DRUG SO HE COULD BE A DEALER IN 
TENNESSEE, PROSECUTORS SAY.

<P>
 A judge ordered a former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy to stand trial 
Thursday after prosecutors played a videotape of him allegedly buying more than 
two pounds of cocaine from an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 William Barr, 25, of Bellflower, who had been assigned to the North County 
Correctional Facility near Castaic, is accused of buying cocaine so that he 
could take it to Tennessee and become a drug dealer, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a preliminary hearing Thursday in Los Angeles Municipal Court, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Alan Yokelson played a videotape with audio apparently capturing 
Barr buying cocaine from an undercover police officer inside a car parked 
outside a post office terminal in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got people (in) Tennessee, Texas, New Jersey, all over," Barr says in the 
tape. "But I just want Tennessee because it's . . . a virgin state." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a opportunity there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the undercover officer discusses the possibility of future 
sales with Barr. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can handle five, 10 kilos of coke when you come back, just let me know 
and we'll consign it to you," the officer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," Barr replies. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape ends with three unmarked police cars closing in on Barr after he 
reaches into the trunk of the undercover officer's car for a red duffel bag 
containing a kilogram, or about 2.2 pounds of cocaine.  
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's hearing also included testimony by a prison inmate who acted as an 
informant in the case and helped authorities plan the phony drug sale and by a 
police officer who posed as a drug dealer during the undercover operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dion Giarrusso, who is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence for 
possession of a controlled substance for sale, testified that he reported Barr 
to authorities out of hope he would receive a lighter prison sentence and a 
transfer to a different jail facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Giarrusso testified that Barr approached him at the North County jail and 
asked him if he "wanted to do some narcotics deals and if I could help him 
out." After contacting authorities, the inmate said he set up a phony sale that 
required Barr to come up with a $7,000 down payment on the cocaine and supplied 
him with a pager number for the police officer who was posing as the drug 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Giarrusso said he lowered the down payment to $1,000 after Barr apparently had 
problems coming up with the money after he had spoken with the officer once in 
February.  
</P>
<P>
 Following the testimony, Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Suzanne Person 
ordered Barr to stand trial on charges of possession of cocaine for sale and 
selling cocaine. He is scheduled to be arraigned July 28 in Los Angeles 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard B. Levine, an attorney representing Barr, said his client is a victim 
of government entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a drug dealer," Levine said. "This whole transaction was created by 
the government."

MOVER CONVICTED OF PRICE GOUGING AFTER EARTHQUAKE; COURTS: BURBANK MAN IS 
SENTENCED TO PAY MORE THAN $5,000, WORK ON AN ANTI-GRAFFITI CREW, AND SERVE TWO 
YEARS' PROBATION.

 A Burbank mover, convicted Thursday of overcharging San Fernando Valley 
residents for moving and storage costs in the days after the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake, was sentenced to pay $5,300 in fines and restitution, perform 20 
days of community service and serve two years' probation, the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Helbert, 27, of Burbank is the third mover convicted of charging 
earthquake victims excessively for services, the city attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four complaints lodged on a Public Utilities Commission hot line number 
prompted the investigation into Helbert's business practices, said P. Greg 
Parham, the deputy city attorney who handled the case. Investigators found that 
Helbert charged about 25% more than the state-approved cost of services in 
those cases, the release said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helbert, who operated Miles Transfer & Storage Co. in Camarillo, pleaded no 
contest to two counts of exceeding the maximum service charge, and one count 
each of operating without proper permits and failure to carry liability 
insurance, Parham said.  
</P>
<P>
 Helbert also will work 20 days on an anti-graffiti crew operated by Caltrans 
or the Los Angeles Police Department, Parham said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest concerns was the fact that Helbert operated "fairly 
significant vehicles on highways without public liability insurance," Parham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, the Public Utilities Commission's special 
investigations unit has investigated 45 consumer complaints against 12 moving 
companies working in the San Fernando Valley, said Larry McNeely, who heads the 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeronimo Maldonado, 32, a Pacoima mover who was convicted of overcharging 
earthquake victims, was ordered to pay $2,700 in fines and restitution. Thomas 
J. Smith, 42, who operated L.A. Moving, Storage & Distribution in Arleta, was 
convicted in May and ordered to pay $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police detective also contacted the commission's special 
investigations unit because he suspected members of Maldonado's crew were 
looting damaged buildings, McNeely said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Serrano, who worked for Maldonado, was charged with one count of 
residential burglary after police arrested him at a quake-damaged building in 
the 4400 block of Colbath Avenue in Sherman Oaks on the night of Jan. 22, 
McNeely said. Serrano had been at the apartment building earlier in the day 
moving a tenant, McNeely said. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeely said his unit is still reviewing possible administrative or legal 
action against the remaining nine movers they have investigated.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LANDSCAPER ARRESTED IN ELDERLY MAN'S 
DISAPPEARANCE; CRIME: MICHAEL BENANTI MOVED INTO JAMES YOUNG'S HOUSE AND TOLD 
NEIGHBORS HE RAN AWAY WITH A NEW LOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 37-year-old landscaper, who told neighbors and investigators that he had 
been left to handle the business affairs of a 73-year-old man who disappeared 
17 months ago, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of murdering the older man, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Benanti, who lived in James Young's house for almost a year following 
Young's disappearance, was arrested at a mobile home park on Antrar Boulevard 
in Palmdale about 7 a.m. Thursday, said Sgt. Ron Spear of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators served search warrants at homes of Benanti's friends and 
relatives in Chatsworth, Canyon Country, Simi Valley, Palmdale and Northridge 
and found jewelry, collectible coins and other personal items belonging to 
Young, said Sheriff's Detective Mike Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti was booked at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station and is being held 
without bail, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also identified forged checks on Young's account for thousands 
of dollars and recovered several vehicles that belonged to Young, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Young's disappearance in February, 1993, a motor home, motorcycles and a 
classic Porsche have slowly disappeared from his back yard, which one neighbor 
called a "junk collector's dream." 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Young was described by several neighbors as a cantankerous old 
man, dozens said they could not believe the account Benanti gave: that Young 
met a Mexican woman in Las Vegas, abandoned his previous life and all his 
possessions and moved to Mexico with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody would ask him (Benanti) about Jim, and he'd say he'd spoken with 
him but he didn't have a (telephone) number or things like that," said one 
neighbor who declined to be identified. "He once said he'd met him up north and 
given him legal papers because his wife didn't like coming to the Antelope 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Young's disappearance and Benanti's explanation gave sheriff's investigators 
cause for doubt, but with 20,000 missing-person reports to check each year, 
Young's case was put together slowly, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost a year, about 35 neighbors and friends signed a petition that 
called for the Sheriff's Department to renew the investigation into Young's 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew this was not right, and it never did sit right with the department," 
Scott said. The department was looking into the case, "but what you have to 
understand is that sometimes a missing person is voluntarily missing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Benanti moved into Young's house after Young's disappearance, those who 
knew and eccentric old man could not believe the landscaper's story. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very possessive of his property and belongings and it just seemed 
strange that he would let someone come in his house, when I know he would never 
let anybody do that," said Pat Weese, a contractor who worked at Young's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who knew James Young knew that something like that would never happen. 
It would be completely out of character."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT TO STEP DOWN; EDUCATION: 
WALTER SWANSON IS LEAVING THE WILLIAM S. HART UNION DISTRICT TO ASSUME A 
POSITION IN MISSOURI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walter Swanson shocked colleagues Thursday by announcing he will resign as 
superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School District and take over 
a similar position in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson, 50, will become the superintendent of the Cass R-IX School District 
in Harrisonville, a suburb south of Kansas City. He said he grew up in that 
area and much of his family is still there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance to be closer to home and friends," he said. "That was my 
primary motivation." 
</P>
<P>
 A resignation date has not been set. Swanson said he expects to remain here at 
the beginning of the school year to work out any problems, although he will 
travel briefly to Harrisonville in August "to help them get started." 
</P>
<P>
 He has been superintendent of the Hart district, with about 11,500 junior and 
senior high students, since January, 1992. The Harrisonville district has about 
2,200 preschool through high school students, plus several hundred more in a 
vocational technical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson said he doesn't mind moving to the smaller district because there is 
more opportunity to implement new programs there than in California, where 
severe budget cuts in recent years have impacted schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The present condition of finances in the state makes it difficult to build 
new components of the American school, although it can happen," he said. "The 
(Harrisonville) district, although smaller, is in position to do a lot of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson was hailed by Hart officials as a person who has presided over 
numerous improvements in his short reign, including the construction of two new 
schools, technology improvements in classroom and management facilities, and 
the establishment of a long-term strategic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him as a person who had a vision and was committed to it," said 
Assistant Superintendent Daniel Hanigan. "He represented change in our 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson announced his decision to school district employees at a meeting 
Thursday morning, Hanigan added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly was surprised," he said. "I didn't know it was coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson grew up in Kansas City and was a teacher and administrator in the 
area, leaving temporarily when he was drafted into the U.S. Army during the 
Vietnam War. He was appointed superintendent of the Poway Unified School 
District in the late 1980s before assuming leadership of the Hart District. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the third Santa Clarita Valley school superintendent to resign this 
year. Scott Brown resigned from the Castaic Union School District on July 1 to 
accept a similar position in northern California, and Troy Bramlett is retiring 
in September from the Saugus Union School District.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TRUCK OVERTURNS ON FREEWAY, SPILLING 30 
GALLONS OF FERTILIZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A truck hauling fertilizer overturned on Henry Mayo Drive near the Golden 
State Freeway on Thursday morning, fouling the commute for motorists during 
rush hour, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 6:50 a.m., when the truck driver apparently lost 
control of the vehicle as it rounded a curve while traveling west on the 
two-lane state highway, CHP Officer Wendy Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 gallons of a fertilizer made from calcium ammonia nitrate spilled 
from the truck's trailer, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Unit contained 
the spill on the roadway before it leaked into the sewer system, a Fire 
Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries, and the road was reopened about 11:15 a.m, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP is investigating the accident, Moore said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE COUNCIL DELAYS ADOPTING NEW BUDGET; 
FINANCES: FUNDING IS UNSETTLED FOR CROSSING GUARDS AND ANTI-DRUG AND 
CRIME-PREVENTION PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unable to decide how much to spend on several key public safety programs, the 
Palmdale City Council has postponed adoption of a new budget for the fiscal 
year that began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Still undecided is the funding for school crossing guards, an anti-drug 
program for elementary school children, a counseling program for troubled 
teen-agers and the Neighborhood Watch crime prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 After sheriff's deputies and parents complained about proposals to curtail or 
eliminate funding for these programs, the City Council decided Wednesday night 
that the finance plan needs more tinkering before it can be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very tough budget," Mayor Jim Ledford said. "This council wants to 
re-look at these issues." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ledford said a full council should be present to decide where 
money will be spent over the coming fiscal year. Councilman Jim Root was absent 
from Wednesday's meeting. "We don't want Councilman Root to miss out on the 
fun," the mayor quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The council ordered a July 26 special workshop to address the thorny safety 
funding problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a measure adopted by the council before July 1, the city can 
continue spending at 1993-94 levels until the overdue 1994-95 finance plan is 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale officials are continuing to wrestle with a lean budget proposal that 
has already led to the layoffs of six employees and calls for the elimination 
of seven other jobs that are not currently filled. City leaders said the 
continuing economic slowdown has reduced revenue flowing into Palmdale, which 
was one of the state's fastest-growing cities in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city services would continue at their present levels under the proposed 
budget. The major exception is law enforcement, which would receive a 
$1.2-million increase over last year. Most of the extra money is earmarked for 
more crime patrols by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 To offset this expense, City Administrator Robert W. Toone Jr. proposed that 
Neighborhood Watch and drug education programs for elementary students, both 
now handled by deputies, be turned over to civilians to cut the cost almost in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he proposed that the city stop paying for school crossing guards, 
turning the $224,000 expense over to the Palmdale School District. Also, he 
urged that no funds be given to the United Community Action Network, a youth 
counseling program that has received $25,000 annually from the city in past 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 These proposals provoked strong criticism from deputies and parents at council 
meetings Tuesday and Wednesday. But council members cautioned that these cuts 
were only recommendations that the council might accept, reject or modify. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the June 26 budget workshop, Ledford urged the other council members 
to propose creative changes in the spending plan that could release more money 
for the safety programs now slated for cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Toone, anxious to get a new budget in place, agreed. 
"Please bring me some solutions," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DISTRICT VOTES TO RESTRICT STUDENTS TO CAMPUS 
AT LUNCH; POLICY: SOME WILLIAM S. HART UNION TRUSTEES SAY THE PLAN WAS RUSHED. 
BUT ALL AGREE THAT PARENTS LIKE THE IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Many local high school students will be restricted to campus during lunch 
starting this fall after authorities approved a two-year plan to improve and 
expand campus facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was approved unanimously Wednesday night by the William S. Hart 
Union High School District board of trustees, although a few board members said 
they are concerned the district is rushing into the plan too quickly. But all 
agreed the idea of not letting students off campus at lunch is a popular idea 
with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if we don't do something, nothing's ever going to happen," said board 
member Patricia Hanrion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth- and 10th-grade students at Santa Clarita's four high schools will be 
kept on campus during lunches this year. Students in the 11th and 12th grades 
will be kept on campus beginning with the 1995-96 school year, although seniors 
will be able to earn the privilege of leaving campus during lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 District studies indicate parents favored closed campuses by about a 3-1 
margin because they would know where their children were at lunchtime and the 
risk of off-campus trouble, such as auto accidents and fights, would be 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Students overwhelmingly opposed closed campuses, stating that already long 
lines at the cafeterias and restrooms would become intolerable if all students 
were confined to campus. Many school administrators also expressed concern 
about the facilities and said additional security would be needed to prevent 
on-campus fights and make sure that students remained at school. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will spend up to $335,000 on improvements and extra personnel 
during the 1994-95 school year, said Assistant Supt. Daniel Hanigan. He said 
most of the money will be used to expand eating facilities, bringing four 
fast-food vendors, such as Subway and Pizza Hut, on campus in addition to the 
cafeteria's usual selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional fencing, restrooms and student activities are also being 
considered, Hanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 An unspecified amount will be spent for improvements for the 1995-96 school 
year, including attempts to establish food courts on campus. Hanigan said 
numerous details, such as how seniors will earn the privilege of leaving 
campus, still have not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 The expense of closing campuses concerned many board members, since the 
district is operating with at least a $1.9-million deficit in the 1994-95 
general fund budget and expects another deficit next year. Officials hope 
increased revenue from food sales will cover the expenses associated with 
closing campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members suggested saving money by making students who violate the 
closed-campus rule pick up trash during lunchtime and recruiting parents as 
volunteers to monitor restrooms, which students say are often unkempt and 
occupied by youths smoking or participating in other inappropriate activities.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; KIDNAPING SUSPECT RETURNED TO L.A. TO FACE 
GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A man arrested in Utah who is suspected of kidnaping and sexually assaulting a 
Val Verde real estate agent has been transported to Los Angeles, where a 
federal grand jury is expected to hear accusations against him next week, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, is in federal custody without bail while prosecutors 
assemble their case and try to secure an indictment from the grand jury, said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra Yang. Shue is charged with one count of kidnaping, 
which could result in life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, also suspected of numerous similar crimes in several states during a 
two-month period, was brought to Los Angeles Tuesday, Yang said. He appeared 
that day before Magistrate Brian Robbins, who ruled there was sufficient 
grounds to keep Shue in custody while prosecutors seek an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of anyone who needs to be in custody more than him," Yang said. 
"Everywhere he stops or pauses he commits another crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, a resident of Cadillac, Mich., is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 1 if 
indicted by the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach Shue's attorney, Humberto Diaz, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is accused of kidnaping Paula Harrington, 26, on June 29 by posing as a 
customer at the real estate office where she worked. He allegedly abducted her 
at gunpoint after they looked at several houses in Val Verde, a small community 
northwest of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was found tied up in a motel room July 1 in Gila Bend, Ariz., a 
small town 68 miles southwest of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue was arrested July 6 in an Ogden, Utah, club after he allegedly displayed 
a handgun to a topless dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also suspected of committing several other kidnapings, rapes and 
robberies in Michigan, Kansas, Oregon and other states. However, law 
enforcement agencies in those areas seeking to prosecute Shue will have to wait 
for the conclusion of the federal proceedings.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HART DISTRICT OKS STUDY OF MEDI-CAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District took its first step toward 
implementing a school-based Medi-Cal program by authorizing a study to 
determine if the idea is feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say the program would allow the school district to receive federal 
funds just for providing existing health services required by law, and the 
money could be used to expand services to needy students and their families. 
But some parents are worried expanded services could include abortion referrals 
and drug counseling obtained without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart district can select what services it wants to be reimbursed for, said 
Craig Cook, a consultant for school-based Medicaid programs. Medi-Cal is the 
state agency that oversees the federal Medicaid program in California. 
</P>
<P>
 There are too many potential benefits -- and drawbacks -- of the proposal to 
reject it without further study, said board member William Dinsenbacher on 
Wednesday night. He emphasized approval of the study does not mean the board 
endorses the plan, and said he strongly opposes providing abortion referrals. 
</P>

 "I think there are some cautions," he said. "However, I believe for us to make 
a decision in the future we need information and this is what we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The study is scheduled to be completed within 45 days. District officials said 
they hope to implement the program by fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate 10 to 15 states have passed recent legislation enabling 
schools to become Medicaid providers, and a pilot program in the San Diego 
Unified School District has received high approval ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 A district report indicates about 6,800 youths between the ages of 5 and 18 -- 
about 20% of students enrolled in local public schools -- would qualify for 
school-based Medi-Cal services. Any plan approved would likely be a cooperative 
effort among the city's school districts, municipal officials, medical centers 
and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will contribute 25 cents for each of the district's 11,500 
students, or about $2,875, toward the $35,000 study. The city of Santa Clarita 
will contribute $1,000 and Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia 
will pay the remainder.

AROUND TOWN: NEVER JUST ONES TO LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under its ornately carved and gilded ceilings, gentlewomen sipped tea as they 
pondered the meaning of Shakespeare and the witticisms of Dorothy Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Their fur pieces biting themselves atop fashionable shoulders, the ladies of 
the Ebell of Los Angeles passed pleasant hours at musicales and chicken a la 
king luncheons. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the start -- 100 years ago -- there was more to Ebell. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1920s, '30s and '40s, these women were hosting talks on "Mexican 
Revolutions" and "Law for Women," learning about reforestation in the Sierras 
and the plight of California's Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 To peruse crumbling Ebell scrapbooks is to take a mini-course in cultural 
anthropology. Consider these snippets: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1919 -- Ebell telegraphs Woodrow Wilson its support of the League of 
Nations.  
</P>
<P>
 * 1945 -- In a gesture of patriotism, 10 members lunch on C-rations out of 
Army mess kits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1950 -- At Ebell Juniors' Cinderella Ball, Mrs. Robert Olney wins for having 
the smallest foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1966 -- Ebell's first debutantes, the Adriannes, bow. (There have been no 
debs since 1990, due to a paucity of Ebell daughters of deb age). 
</P>
<P>
 Segue to June, 1994: In the imposing 55-foot-by-120-foot salon of the Italian 
Renaissance clubhouse at Wilshire and Lucerne boulevards, "My Blue Heaven" 
wafts from the grand piano (one of Ebell's five). Up in the loggia, one can 
almost see the chaperons who peered down on long-ago tea dansants. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything's been spiffed up. New carpets, new draperies. Ebell is celebrating 
its centennial. 
</P>
<P>
 But surely that isn't jug wine? Well, it is the '90s and, while it will never 
be said of Ebell that anything goes, some things do give. Until 1982, alcohol 
never touched lips under this roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most traditions remain as solid as the clubhouse's three-foot-thick 
walls, which came through the January quake crackless. 
</P>
<P>
 New president Betty Jean Shea ("Mrs. Robert M.," in Ebell-ese), a retired 
attorney, says, "We are not just the ladies who lunch." Never were. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebell-L.A. was born of a meeting of forward-thinking women at the home of two 
spinster sisters in October, 1894. The minutes note that the mad scene from 
"Lucia di Lammermoor" was sung to accompaniment by a hired piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not L.A.'s first women's club, Ebell was surely the most provocative, 
a new link in an international network of women's literary and scientific 
societies founded by Ceylon-born, Yale-educated Dr. Adrian Ebell, who thought 
the world needed thinking women. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has always agreed. In the '50s, housewives amused themselves at 
bridge. So did Ebell women; they also debated the Korean conflict and studied 
money management. 
</P>
<P>
 Its study groups thrive today, although the Shakespeare and Robert Browning 
units disbanded for lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Ebell's portals have passed some of the most interesting people in the 
world: Richard Nixon, Mme. Chiang Kai-shek, Thomas Mann, Carrie Jacobs Bond, 
Aldous Huxley, Carl Sandberg, Ronald Reagan. In 1937, Amelia Earhart spoke 
there shortly before taking off on her last flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebell has always had a split personality. In 1899, its monthly journal 
admonished women: "Do not be an echo." The modern woman should see and read 
everything "and then shut or open her eyes judiciously." 
</P>
<P>
 And she should practice how to talk "without wrinkling the skin." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Always, there was more on Ebell minds than canapes and calling cards. In the 
1920s, Ebell boycotted potatoes to protest post-war profiteering. If these 
women fretted about sagging faces, as suggested by an early Ebell magazine ad 
touting "scientific strapping," they also explored the life of Benjamin 
Disraeli. 
</P>
<P>
 Think the anti-smoking movement is new? "The only person who ever smoked in 
this building and got away with it was the Queen of Romania," said Gloria 
Droguett, slipping out of the birthday gala for a cigarette on the patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Droguett -- Mrs. Rudy Droguett -- chaired the five-year $500,000 centennial 
face lift of the 67-year-old clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 A centennial drive netting 100 new members gave Ebell-L.A. further cause to 
celebrate. The largest women's cultural club in the world with 3,000 members at 
its peak in 1927, it had dropped to about 300. Today's thinking woman is busy 
tending her career and, Shea acknowledges, attracting the young is "a 
continuing challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Ebell was for white women; now, there are a few Asian-American 
and black members. Shea wants more attention paid to diversity and to "learning 
more about our community." Recently, Ebell's fire-damaged neighbor, United 
Methodist Church, has held services in Ebell's dining room. That kind of 
open-door policy pleases her. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Ebell's off-site rest cottage was an oasis for working women 
recuperating from illness. Interest on funds from the sale of the cottage in 
1980 aids such charities as shelters for homeless and battered women. The Ebell 
scholarship fund, boosted by bequests, has given away $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you've visited Ebell on TV or movies. Filmed there have been episodes 
of: "Murder, She Wrote," "Unsolved Mysteries," "Dallas," "Cagney and Lacey," 
"L.A. Law," "Dynasty" and "Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a nice bit of income. Droguett jokes that maybe she'll yet get the 
upstairs solarium repainted free. Its industrial green makes her cringe, but it 
sells: On screen, the solarium has been everything from a hospital ward to a 
school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No slouches in matters financial, Ebell women invested $970,000 in the land 
and building at Wilshire and Lucerne in the mid-'20s and burned the mortgage in 
20 years. (The ashes rest in a silver urn). 
</P>
<P>
 The property, including the 1,300-seat Wilshire Ebell Theatre and the parking 
lot, acquired later, is now valued at $7 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigmund Romberg's "The Desert Song" premiered at the theater's 1927 opening. 
Judy Garland was first spotted by an MGM talent agent at auditions on its 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebell, at 100, carries on. Three housemen maintain the 75,000-square-foot 
clubhouse, which is the final resting place of massive antiques given by 
members or their families who found them a bit overpowering at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The clubhouse is guaranteed immortality. In May, it was added to the National 
Register of Historic Places.

ELIXIRS OF LOVE?; TWO SCIENTISTS HAVE BOTTLED COMPETING PRODUCTS THAT ARE 
SUPPOSED TO ENHANCE ROMANCE -- OR AT LEAST MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE KNOWLTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With names like Realm and Athena, they certainly sound sexy, like something 
you'd see advertised in the back of a magazine -- and we're not talking about 
Highlights or the Nation. 
</P>
<P>
 They're two new fragrance products created with the ages-old goal of enhancing 
romance. Exposure on TV news and talk shows, in science and health magazines 
and in newspapers has helped fuel brisk sales, their promoters say. 
</P>
<P>
 But some independent scientists have questions about how the biochemistry 
works, and the Food and Drug Administration might soon start sniffing around, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventors of Realm and Athena are rival scientists-turned-entrepreneurs, 
each of whom claims to have developed the only formula containing pheromones -- 
airborne chemical messengers released by one body to affect others of the same 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventors stress that the products are cosmetics and not aphrodisiacs, 
which would make them drugs in the eyes of the FDA and bring about closer 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 One, called Realm, comes as two perfumes -- one for women and one for men. It 
was developed by Dr. David Berliner, a former University of Utah researcher who 
founded Pherin Corp., a pharmaceutical development company in Menlo Park, 
Calif., and Erox Corp. in Fremont, Calif., a consumer product company whose 
first venture is these Realm perfumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," says Michael Stern, Erox's vice president of sales and marketing, "is 
not snake oil. It promotes attractiveness by making the wearer feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 The other product -- a fragrance additive for women -- is Athena Pheromone 
10:13. It was developed by former University of Pennsylvania researcher 
Winnifred Cutler, who conducted studies at the Monell Chemical Senses Center -- 
a respected, nonprofit research company in Philadelphia -- and later founded 
her own research company, the Athena Institute of Women's Wellness in 
Haverford, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," she says, "is not snake oil. It definitely promotes sexual 
attractiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, an FDA official says the agency might take a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that claims -- either by advertising, labeling or word of mouth -- 
to promote sexual attractiveness or performance would be considered an 
aphrodisiac, and therefore likely a drug," says John Bailey, acting director of 
the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who had not heard of Realm or Athena, says he is "aware of products 
today being promoted as fragrances that are somehow mood-altering." Because 
drugs require FDA approval, Bailey says it's a "pretty good bet" his agency 
will look at both products and take regulatory action, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "(These) sound like a new twist on old types of products that claim to produce 
changes in mental states," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just what is it about pheromones that has everyone so excited? While their 
existence in insects and mammals has long been scientifically established -- 
among other functions, they're what cause male dogs to chase female dogs in 
heat -- human pheromones are less understood. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Cutler and then-colleague George Preti published research in the 
scientific journal Hormones and Behavior about the possibility of human 
pheromones, findings widely publicized in national mainstream media. (Time 
magazine headlined it "The Hidden Power of Body Odors.") 
</P>
<P>
 The studies, conducted at the University of Pennsylvania and the Monell 
center, indicated that substances extracted from male and female underarm 
secretions and later applied under a woman's nose could beneficially alter the 
timing of her menstrual periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the precise nature and chemical workings of the collected substances 
were not reported, Cutler then speculated that synthetic versions could have 
practical applications in areas of infertility, menopause and birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Cutler of that time: "My dream was that manufactured pheromones, in 
creams, sprays or perfumes, could dramatically alter the well-being of women." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler left Monell to found the Athena Institute, and for the next seven years 
investigated pheromones independently while applying for patents and figuring 
out how to produce a product in quantity. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, she released 10:13 as a "cosmetic additive to promote 
romance"; appeared on "Sally Jessy Raphael," "The Montel Williams Show" and 
other talk shows to tout it; impressed a self-described California "romance 
therapist" enough to recommend it, and subsequently sold by mail and phone 
"many thousands of vials" at $95 for one-sixth of an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a natural outcome of two decades of research," she says of her 
formula, designed to be mixed with about two ounces of a woman's favorite 
non-spray fragrance and dabbed on every day and worn for at least six hours for 
maximum effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 So, does it work? 
</P>
<P>
 Preti, an organic chemist who still works at Monell, doesn't see how this 
product could have grown from any research he's aware of. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his past work with Cutler demonstrated only that there was in underarm 
secretions "something physiologically active" that can affect a woman's 
menstrual cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Preti: "Where she comes up with the other contention -- put on the magic 
potion and your love life will improve -- I have no idea. There's no real 
evidence that sexual attractants (in humans) exist." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cutler says she has unpublished, "sophisticated research" that shows human 
pheromones do promote sexual attraction and that her synthetic pheromone 
product achieves this for about 70% of women. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Berliner, speaking from his office at Pherin, says his discovery of 
human pheromones and their resulting products ("the first and only fragrances 
to contain human pheromones," reads an Erox Corp. annual report) had its 
origins three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He was studying human skin at the University of Utah then and had gathered 
specimens from the insides of broken-legged skiers' casts, extracts that were 
left in open containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, he noticed that he and other laboratory workers were "unusually 
friendly and communicative," he says. "They even wanted to play bridge, which 
was very unusual." But when Berliner covered the flasks, everyone went back to 
their "normal selves," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Berliner froze the samples and put them aside until 1989, when after seeing 
reports from Monell and other studies, he returned to the skin cells with the 
idea that human pheromones were responsible for the feel-good phenomenon he had 
observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Berliner figured out the chemical structure of what he called pheromones, 
synthesized them and went seeking proof that what he had were indeed 
pheromones. 
</P>
<P>
 The key, he thought, lay in the vomeronasal organ, or VNO, a "sixth-sense" 
nasal organ that in animals detects odorless pheromones, many of which are 
related to sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The VNO had long been believed absent or at least dormant in adult humans, but 
Berliner had read then-little-known research that led him to think human adults 
may have functioning VNOs. So he gathered colleagues and asked them to help 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting 1991 company-sponsored research report concluded not only that 
the human VNO exists and functions, but that it was stimulated by at least two 
of Berliner's compounds, which were not identified in the report. (These 
findings have not yet been corroborated by independent researchers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Berliner says that once he knew he had pheromones, he formed Erox and 
developed perfumes. Because the quick-diffusing pheromones in Realm don't work 
on anyone more than a foot away, he says, the products are targeted for the 
wearer, rather than anyone of the opposite sex nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 So do they work? 
</P>
<P>
 Wearers report "feeling more romantic, more attractive and happier," the Realm 
brochure says. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December and January, Erox obtained patents for compounds (including 
fragrances) containing human pheromones. (The patents state the names of the 
"compositions" found to stimulate the VNOs of males and females, but not 
Realm's formulas.) 
</P>
<P>
 The human pheromones he put in Realm have nothing to do with sexual 
attractiveness, Berliner says, because that would make Realm an aphrodisiac. 
Instead, pheromones in Realm have to do with "good vibes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you'll be in the presence of a person and either feel good or not 
feel good," he says. "It's a chemical communication that we call good or bad 
vibes." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 Erox shareholder report's section on marketing strategy describes 
planned development of promotional materials that "suggest the enhanced 
sensuality" Realm users may experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But sensuality is not the same as sexuality, Berliner says. "If I am wearing 
Realm, I am feeling very secure about myself. I feel more ready and at that 
moment there's a communication factor. The woman feels it and there's a 
sensuality. It's a very different thing than sexuality." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a truncated initial marketing effort, the company sold more than 660 
units of Realm, at $60 for 1.7 ounces, in May via word of mouth, says Stern, 
the marketing executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Preti, the organic chemist, says he admires Berliner and associates' work on 
the VNO but reserves judgment on pheromone claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be a compound that stimulates the VNO -- that part of this work is 
excellent," he says. "But saying that the type of molecule they have is a 
pheromone because it stimulates the VNO is somewhat silly to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Preti wonders about Erox's definition of pheromones. 
</P>
<P>
 Says the company literature: "Human pheromones don't arouse sexual desire; nor 
do they heighten sexual pleasure. Instead, they help you feel more attractive 
by enhancing positive feelings such as comfort, security, well-being and 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 "They created a new definition," Preti says. "Sounds like a California-type 
thing to me. The FDA may look at it differently, and that's what all these 
people are deathly afraid of." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cutler and Berliner say they are careful to make no claims that would 
warrant FDA attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Cutler: "All aphrodisiacs are illegal. We're scrupulous in only making 
cosmetic claims and disclaiming any aphrodisiac or drug role for our product." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Berliner: "We're not claiming to be curing any diseases here. Realm is 
strictly a cosmetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Customer comments provided by Cutler and Stern sound like testimonials. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote one Athena customer who mixed 10:13 with Shalimar and then went out with 
her boyfriend: "Our relationship has intensified in the most wonderful way. 
He's begun to look at me wistfully . . . and faxes poetry to me. This was not 
his style prior to (using the product.) He's become very exciting, and the pull 
between us is almost tangible." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler also has written testimonials from a "happily married Las Vegas 
stripper" who got $120 in tips in just 45 minutes, a Florida nurse who for the 
first time in years felt her sexual desire return, and an executive whose 
"sales ratios" with male clients increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern provides anecdotes from customers who will appear on a planned 
infomercial. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a woman in the finance business who works with her husband of two 
decades. Their marriage had "gone flat," Stern says, until they both started 
using Realm. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went away for a weekend and had the best time they'd had in years," 
Stern says. "They believe that using Realm rekindled the spark that was really 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler won't say whether she uses her product, but Erox's Stern says he uses 
Realm Men every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having a good hair day," he says, "like a little pick-me-up. You 
feel calm, cool and collected so the real you can come out."

CYBURBIA: THE GOODS; ELVIS IS ALIVE AND WELL AND CRUISIN' THE 'NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I saw Elvis on the Internet, and I have the printouts to prove it. Scoff if 
you like. I now know the exact street corner in Toronto where velvet Elvis 
paintings are sold, that a CD-ROM tour of Graceland is soon to be released and 
that there are 126 books about Elvis' life currently in print, including "The 
Elvis Presley Encyclopedia," "The Official FBI File on Elvis" and "God's Work 
Through Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
 I stumbled across this information -- and I do mean stumbled -- in the course 
of learning about the legendary research capabilities of the Internet, the 
international network that combines the forces of thousands of computers 
accessible by millions of users. 
</P>
<P>
 To those skilled in the use of the Internet for research, there are vast 
amounts of information available in the form of text, photographs, artworks, 
sounds and even videos that can be downloaded to the home computer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Internet is decidedly not, in its purer forms, user friendly. Full 
access -- whether gained through a university (many offer free use of the 
Internet to students and staff members), an employer or a paid service -- 
requires patience and one of the many thick guides you can find in your 
bookstore's computer section (good luck -- I have not looked at all of them, 
but I have yet to find one that gives easily understood how-to instructions). 
</P>
<P>
 Navigating around the full Internet still requires a bit of knowledge of the 
UNIX computer language that was the standard long before Macintosh and Windows 
icons made desktop computers practical for the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 My access to the Internet is through the heavily advertised, relatively 
easy-to-use Delphi service that is owned by Rupert Murdoch (maybe he uses it to 
track killer bee invasions) and based in Boston. Delphi charges by the hour, 
but gives new users the first five hours free. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll spend most, if not all of that time tearing at your hair in frustration 
and calling Delphi's 800 number to plead for assistance. But eventually, even a 
techno-klutz like me can learn to use at least some of the Internet's research 
tools, such as FTP, Gopher, Newsgroups and, my favorites, Archie and Veronica. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a dangerously small amount of knowledge, I went in search of Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 First stop was Newsgroups, the hundreds of on-line interest groups that can be 
found covering topics ranging from computer languages to exotic sex rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the book "Net Guide" (Random House, 1994) that lists Newsgroups by 
topics, I found one called alt.elvis.king. There were currently 26 messages 
listed in that area (as messages get old, they are erased), which is a tiny 
number for a Newsgroup. Some get thousands of messages each week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the faithful of alt.elvis.king had left heartfelt messages about favorite 
songs and new products, such as the upcoming Graceland CD-ROM. One 
knowledgeable user posted the disappointing news that the CD-ROM tour would not 
include the upstairs of the mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is off limits, just like at the real Graceland," posted a user who calls 
himself Clayface. 
</P>
<P>
 Velvet paintings were a hot topic, with exact directions given to those in 
search of textured images of the king of rock 'n' roll. One user offered for 
sale a velvet painting of Elvis depicted as a bullfighter. I was tempted. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was off to Veronica, Archie and other search tools used to track down 
computer file titles containing the word "Elvis." Even as a novice researcher I 
got well over 100 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Many led to highly technical computer applications named in honor of Elvis. 
But there was also the White House photograph of Elvis meeting President Nixon 
that could be downloaded into my computer. And a bibliographic guide to Elvis' 
recordings, movies and TV appearances ran to 267 pages of text.  
</P>
<P>
 One user, in a text-file on the parallels between the lives of Elvis and 
Jesus, pointed out: 
</P>
<P>
 "Fact: Jesus was resurrected." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fact: Elvis had his comeback special in '68." 
</P>
<P>
 In several files, lyrics to Elvis song hits were listed. And one enterprising 
user had translated Elvis' songs into the Swedish-inflected talk of the Muppets 
character, the Swedish Chef.

THE GOODS; THEY'RE ATTACKING FROM EVERYWHERE! WHAT TO DO ABOUT...; ANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It's ant season. A couple of weeks ago, those armies of black dots marching 
across your kitchen were looking for relief from the heat, says Rosser 
Garrison, agricultural entomologist for Los Angeles County. "I had them in my 
own house." 
</P>
<P>
 If it's not relief from heat, then they're looking for relief from cold or 
from too much dry weather or from too much wet weather. And food is always on 
their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no single ant season. Ants can invade any time, streaming into the 
house in formation like a living highway, up the outside walls, along the 
baseboards, through windowsill cracks and even through electric light sockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're seeing is the Argentine house ant (Iridomyrmex humilis )," 
Garrison says. "That's what everyone is talking about. They are harmless -- 
small and black and incapable of stinging, but very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 The bright side: "If there are termites in the way, they'll eat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although ants are happiest nesting in cool soil, any extreme weather from 
heavy rainfall to drought can displace them, Garrison says, sending their 
scouts out in all directions to find a suitable spot to camp. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's hot, Garrison says, "they're out looking for food, moisture and 
coolness." 
</P>
<P>
 That means a house, and once they're in with all the amenities -- food, water 
and lots of places to hide -- ants have a field day, says Jack Herson, 
president of Fume a Pest. 
</P>
<P>
 They also send for their relatives. "It won't stop," says Herson, who gets 
frantic calls from people who find ants as terrifying as rats. "Ants are social 
and will set up their entire family (numbering in the hundreds of thousands) 
almost anywhere. Basically, if you give an ant shelter and food, it'll be your 
friend for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting rid of ants requires securing the house inside and out. The kitchen 
comes first, says Yvonne Savio of Pasadena, a master gardener with UC 
Cooperative Extension. "Ants don't have a refrigerator at home -- they are 
always looking for food." 
</P>
<P>
 Clean counter surfaces and cupboards with a wet sponge and a bit of detergent. 
"Ants leave scent trails and you've got to get rid of them," Savio says. She 
recommends Simple Green, a biodegradable household cleanser that not only stops 
ants dead in their tracks, she says, but also stops their replacements -- they 
won't cross the dried path. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't leave food out, especially anything containing sugar or grease. Store 
all food in sealed containers.  
</P>
<P>
 Ants can be outwitted, Savio says. "If they are streaming into a potted plant, 
take it outside and flood it. If it's too big to move, bring in a pot of 
compost, put it next to the plant and put a stick between them for a bridge. 
Then flood the plant. The ants will move into the compost pot and you can take 
it outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
 Other home-remedies for stopping ants in their tracks abound. They include 
Windex, hair spray, liquid detergents or vinegar and water on surfaces where 
ants invade. Some say the ant parade may be stopped by sprinkling black and red 
pepper on windowsills and in doorways, sprinkling cornmeal where ants are 
located (they will eat it, but die when they drink water and the corn meal 
expands) or by drawing thick chalk lines, which ants will not cross. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real battle, the experts say, must be at the source. "Try to follow 
ant trails to the point of entry," Savio says.  
</P>
<P>
 Ants frequently nest in hollow spaces such as between walls or under cabinets, 
areas that can be sprayed with an insecticide dust or boric acid powder. Stuff 
fresh mint leaves into baseboards and wall cracks, crushing it so the oils are 
released. Or use glue to seal cracks where ants come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoors, check out the footings of the house and all the utility connections. 
Savio favors Cooke's Ant Spray for long-term prevention. "I use it on the 
entire base of the house," she says. "I wear a mask and wash my clothes 
afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Herson's preventive advice is to fix dripping outdoor faucets, caulk openings 
where pipes enter the house and check pool areas or barbecues where soda or 
beer cans might be left. "Ants not only like syrup and sugar, they love beer," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Check trees that overhang the house for ant activity, he says. "You might want 
to cut the branches away from the house. Remove any fallen fruit that could 
provide an ant eating binge." 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical sprays, everyone agrees, should be approached with caution.  
</P>
<P>
 Too many people just grab the Raid can and fire away, Herson says. "Typically 
we'll come into a house and see five or six cans of different aerosol sprays 
sitting on the porch empty," he says. "Sometimes they are not even labeled for 
inside or outside. Spraying the wrong chemicals in the wrong place can put 
everybody in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 For advice about chemicals, he says, call a professional exterminator or the 
Los Angeles Country Agriculture Commissioner's office. "If it's a seasonal 
thing, they can tell you what has been effective." 
</P>
<P>
 County entomologist Garrison's advice is to spray only as a last resort.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can diminish the population with a soap solution or insecticidal soap or 
pesticides from your nursery," he says. But you must read all the instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bug sprays work for a rapid knockdown of an insect pest, but they smell bad 
and they are poison." 
</P>
<P>
 A common request he gets is for a pesticide that will be "totally organic, and 
totally safe for children, parakeets and the family dog, but absolutely deadly 
to ants." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't exist.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you think you're going to eradicate the Argentine house ant, forget it. 
They are a natural component of the urban ecosystem here. They are an important 
link in the food chain, providing a source of food for many, many, animals. 
They are decomposers; they help recycle nutrients in the soil." 
</P>
<P>
 In case you have trouble appreciating the noble qualities of your own ants, 
Garrison recommends Bert Holldobler's and Edward O. Wilson's 1991 book "The 
Ants." 
</P>
<P>
 "It won the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction," he says. "It's a 
magnificent tome."

INK: NEW PUBLISHING MOTTO: HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've seen the motion picture . . . now read the book. Indeed, it appears the 
biggest growth sector in publishing consists of movie tie-ins and so-called 
novelizations of Hollywood screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
 A shoulder-high rack in one mid-town Manhattan chain store is crammed with 
paperback narratives spawned by summer releases such as "I Love Trouble," "The 
Shadow," "Maverick" and "True Lies," the Arnold Schwarzenegger flick that opens 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lion King," Disney's new animation hit, has generated four briskly 
selling books, as well as a coffee-table release, "The Art of The Lion King" 
(Hyperion), priced at $50. On the other hand, the lackluster reviews and 
disappointing box office for "Wyatt Earp" may bode poorly for the paperback 
novelization from Warner and the two "pictorial companion books" published by 
Newmarket Press. 
</P>
<P>
 To those outside the movie industry, the credits on these books can appear as 
complex as those of most films. The paperback edition of "Blown Away," for 
example, notes that it's a novelization by Kirk Mitchell based on a story by 
John Rice, Joe Batteer and M. Jay Roach, and a screenplay by Batteer and Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the curious parlance of publishing, most of these books are considered 
"literary merchandise," as opposed to real books -- such as Winston Groom's 
"Forrest Gump," published by Doubleday eight years ago. Then again, even the 
new paperback reissue of "Forrest Gump," published by Pocket Books, has the 
unmistakable look of literary merchandise: The words "Tom Hanks is Forrest 
Gump" and the actor's picture dwarf the tiny type that reads: "A Novel by 
Winston Groom." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes. There's also "Gumpisms," an 88-page paperback ($5) also from Pocket 
Books dressed up with an introduction by P.J. O'Rourke and subtitled "The Wit 
and Wisdom of Forrest Gump." Such as: "Do not drink soup; it puts a lake in 
your stomach." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Irwyn Applebaum, the president and publisher of Bantam Books, the 
success of a movie and the use of a compelling cover image from the film are 
key elements in the marketing of a novelization or other tie-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Applebaum adds that the release of a film on video frequently will curtail 
interest in a novelization while real books can profit from almost any kind of 
movie exposure. Bantam's paperback editions of Tom Robbins' "Even Cowgirls Get 
the Blues" and Isabel Allende's "The House of the Spirits" enjoyed renewed 
popularity upon release of the films, even though they were in theaters only a 
short time. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these days, as more and more publishing becomes Hollywoodized, agents will 
often talk about a book's movie prospects even before it is published," 
Applebaum says. 
</P>
<P>
 And lucky are the publishers that hold copyright to backlist titles belatedly 
brought to the screen -- books such as Edith Wharton's "The Age of Innocence," 
first printed in 1920 and revived last year as a Collier Books bestseller (with 
Michelle Pfeiffer and Daniel Day-Lewis pictured on the cover) when Martin 
Scorsese's film version bowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how many of these tie-ins you may think there are now, I don't 
think it compares to the number turned out in the '40s, for example, when so 
many more movies were being made and almost all of them had some sort of 
published tie-in," says Michael Barson, a collector of film-industry arcana who 
is writing a book on Hollywood directors for Farrar, Straus & Giroux. These 
books go back even to the silent era, says Barson, who owns a hardcover 
novelization of Buster Keaton's "The General" (1927). 
</P>
<P>
 The superhits of the movie-book symbiosis include author William Kotzwinkle's 
novelization of "E.T." and John Grisham's paperback of "The Firm" (with Tom 
Cruise on the cover). But nothing matches the paperback sales of Michael 
Crichton's "Jurassic Park." The "Jurassic Park" movie fever of last year helped 
turn the Ballantine paperback (with the film's dinosaur logo on the cover) into 
a gusher -- more than 9 million copies sold. 
</P>
<P>
 And the gusher may not have run dry. When the "Jurassic Park" video is 
released in October -- an event to be hyped in a multimillion-dollar marketing 
campaign organized by MCA/Universal -- Ballantine plans to display its 
"Jurassic Park" paperback alongside copies of the video. 
</P>
<P>
 The next frontier may be print spinoffs of popular video games. In February, 
Del Rey, a division of the Ballantine Publishing Group, plans to issue Geary 
Gravel's "The Dreamwright," a paperback novelization based on the "Might and 
Magic" computer role-playing games. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe electronic media won't be the death of print after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Spy Lives Again: With logo intact and trademark pranks aplenty, Spy has been 
resurrected from the magazine graveyard by its new owner, Sussex Publishers. 
"Reports of our death were . . . well, let's say partially exaggerated," begins 
an introductory note to readers in the new August issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Spy had been running out of gas and continued to lose money when former owner 
Jean Pigozzi decided the March issue would be the last. He sold the name and 
presumably the subscription list to Sussex, which has re-enlisted several of 
the writers who gave Spy its satirical bent. 
</P>
<P>
 Insanity in the new Spy includes conversations with phone sex purveyors about 
the Supercollider and economist Milton Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Big Books Signed: Two of the more high-profile books being shopped to 
publishers in recent months have been acquired by New York houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe McGinniss, the best-selling author of "Fatal Vision" and "Blind Faith," 
will explore the O.J. Simpson case and the adulation of sports figures in a 
book for Crown Publishers. Michelle Sidrane, the publisher of Crown, said on 
Monday that McGinniss had agreed to a two-book deal and would begin by writing 
"a more thoughtful and important work" than the instant books on the Simpson 
affair that already have come out. No publication date has been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who led his team to three consecutive NBA 
championships, plans to write about his managerial approach and the influence 
of New-Age philosophy on his style in a book for Bantam, the publishing house 
announced Thursday. "Wake Up and Win" is scheduled for release in the fall of 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Both authors were represented by Janklow & Nesbit Associates, the New York 
literary agency.

LET US NOW SING THE PRAISES OF THE FOURTH TENOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rip Rense, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody asks Damon Lanza if he can sing. When we met for coffee the other 
morning, I asked him too. 
</P>
<P>
 " I could hire myself out to clear out parties!" he said, laughing. "Just put 
me up there. I'll start singing and everybody will leave. I knew from an early 
age that I couldn't sing. When people ask me if I sing, I say, 'Yes, I do--very 
badly.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The reason people always ask Damon this question is his last name. It was 
given to him by a fellow named Mario, who was his father. Mario Lanza, as you 
might remember, could carry a tune. Well, that's a bit of an understatement. In 
my unpublished novel, I described the voice of the late tenor as "the northern 
lights in a throat." I don't know if that's good writing, but I believe it to 
be an accurate description. 
</P>
<P>
 I first encountered the strange power of Mario Lanza' voice, incongruously 
enough, during the summer of 1967 in Isla Vista, Calif. The Summer of Love, as 
the media has canned it. I was visiting my older brother in the isolated 
cliff-side college town, a place teeming with hairy heads full of daisies, and 
two-fingered peace signs. "Sgt. Pepper" played constantly in apartments; it was 
an unbroken sound track of the moment, rarely out of earshot. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbroken, that is, except when my brother cranked up Mario. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother, you see, preferred Lanza to the Beatles. Periodically, he would 
rent Lanza's movie, "The Great Caruso," and project it in the living room of 
his rustic, rambling beach house. It was during one of those screenings, one 
warm night, that I first suspected something unearthly was coming from Lanza's 
larynx. 
</P>
<P>
 The front door had been left open, as it often was, and Mario's passionate 
tones spilled out into the street. As he sang the wrenching notes of the Verdi 
aria "Vesti La Giubba" a number of "freaks" (a flattering term at the time) 
wandered in, some in questionable states of consciousness. They entered the 
room quietly, irresistibly, sat spellbound, then left quietly when the movie 
ended. Probably in even more questionable states of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a remarkable thing. The Voice had beckoned them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since that night, I've been a sucker for Mario Lanza. Like Mario, I much 
prefer his operatic recordings--his "Che Gelida Manina" (the 1951 version) 
makes my hair look like Don King's--but I have to say that even some of the 
schmaltz gets to me. I admit to watery eyes while hearing him sing "Golden 
Days" from "The Student Prince." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which means I have a lot in common with three guys putting on a little 
recital Saturday at Dodger Stadium: Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose 
Carreras. (Hint: It isn't soccer.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'Three Tenors' have been asked, 'Why did you get into singing?' " Damon 
told me, "and they all said, ' Well, we got into singing because we watched 
Mario Lanza movies.' "  
</P>
<P>
 It's true. The Three Tenors have long acknowledged Mario's influence. Domingo 
paid him tribute by narrating the definitive video documentary on his life, 
"The American Caruso," in the early '80s. Carreras just released a CD tribute 
to Mario, and Pavarotti has sung the praises of Mario in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 As onetime amateur tenor Bob Dolfi, a longtime friend of the Lanza family, put 
it: 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Three Tenors sing, there's not three up there, there's four. That's 
what I honestly believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolfi and another longtime Lanza family friend, Henry Garcia, joined Damon and 
me for coffee. The excuse? For them, it was a question of love and 
duty--they're dedicated to preserving Mario's memory. For me, it was news. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanza died under mysterious circumstances in 1959, but two brand-new CDs--the 
first releases of entirely new Lanza recordings since his death--have appeared 
in the past couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
 The voice does not die. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my father's singing came from his heart and his soul--from deep 
within," said Damon, 41, a Los Angeles restaurateur in partnership with Dolfi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some singers sing mechanically, according to how they've been taught, and 
they do it wonderfully. But my dad once made a statment that every time he 
sings, he dies a little. Because he's giving so much of himself, so much from 
the heart, the soul. I think that's what people really love to hear. It's like 
a gift from God." 
</P>
<P>
 Many others have suggested that the Fourth Tenor's vocal gifts were 
practically supernatural. Lanza suspected he was possessed by the ghost of 
Caruso; he was born in 1921, the year Caruso died. 
</P>
<P>
 True, critics have pointed out a lack of refinement witnessed in more studied 
singers, but Lanza's voice was so naturally beautiful and breathtakingly 
powerful that the great conductor Arturo Toscanini pronounced it "the greatest 
voice of the 20th Century." That pretty well makes the case. 
</P>
<P>
 And I'll take heart over technical perfection every time. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask, 'What makes Lanza so great?' " Dolfi said, "my answer to 
that would be if you sing an aria, and it calls for a high C, what 
distinguishes who is better? Feeling. Mario sang with tremendous feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The voice first beckoned Dolfi at age 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't know anything about music, " he said. "One day, my mother and father 
sent me to my room for punishment. I turned on the radio, looking for loud 
music. And Mario had just started to sing 'Be My Love' on the Coca-Cola (radio) 
show in 1951. And as he sang, I got goose pimples, I mean, at 11 years old! And 
I got tears. I said, what's wrong with me? And I couldn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 When Dolfi eventually found he wasn't gifted enough to be "another Lanza," he 
devoted himself to the man's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '60s, Dolfi, Lanza's parents, and Lanza's close friend and 
biographer Terry Robinson toured the country to pay tribute to the late tenor, 
showing film excerpts and introducing people to the voice. " ' Come in and 
listen to Mario,' we said," Dolfi recalled. "Halfway through the shows, I'd 
look out at people and say, 'How'd you like it?' I would see tears." 
</P>
<P>
 Damon nodded. He remembers such moments, and he also remembers his 
father--despite having lost him at age 6. Chiefly, he recalls Papa coming in to 
tell bedtime stories, sing "Guardian Angels," then kiss his brother and 
sisters--Marc, Elissa, Colleen--good night. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he spoke for them when he told me: 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost both my parents (Lanza's wife, Betty, died heartbroken shortly after 
her husband), but as far as my father is concerned, I still can listen to his 
voice. If I want, I can put on one of his movies, or the appearance he and my 
mother made on TV. So I think people that have lost their parents don't have 
things that I have. It's a big part of my life. I listen to my father a lot. 
It's kind of like visiting with him. It's spiritual." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Had Lanza lived (he died in an Italian hospital, officially of a heart attack, 
but family members have long suspected a mob murder), he would be 73 years old. 
Would he have a ticket to see the Three Tenors? "Oh, you bet!" Dolfi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the tickets go for about year's average salary in the better parts of 
China. If you can't afford one, you might consider doing what I'm going to do. 
I'm renting "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and I'm hooking the movie up 
to my stereo system. Then I'm going to open my front door and let the voice 
spill out into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you go to the concert, you might take a moment to remember the Fourth 
Tenor. Think of him as singing high harmony. Very high harmony. I'm sure the 
Three Tenors do.
