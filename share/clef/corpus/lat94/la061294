POP MUSIC; MR. MELTING POT; USING HIS LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN HERITAGE AS A 
SPRINGBOARD TO MULTICULTURAL MUSIC, SINGER JON SECADA IS REALIZING HIS 
CROSSOVER DREAMS WHILE PROMOTING INTEGRATION 'BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS 
ABOUT'

<P>
 The business of being Jon Secada is being conducted today on Stage 14 at NBC's 
Burbank studios, where the 32-year-old Afro Cuban American singer is taping 
"The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Secada -- who blasted out of nowhere in 1992 with a debut album 
that has sold 6 million worldwide and a Grammy-winning Spanish-language 
counterpart that has sold another 400,000 -- will perform the hit single from 
his new album, "Heart, Soul & a Voice," for the NBC late-night show "Friday 
Night." After that, there's a "meet and greet" with fans who won a "Meet Jon 
Secada" contest. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, there are pictures to be taken, grateful-sounding thanks to be 
murmured, flesh to be pressed. 
</P>
<P>
 After that . . . well, after that, Jon Secada -- handsome, soft-spoken, genial 
Jon Secada -- would be forgiven for bouncing off the walls in his room at Le 
Parc Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that that's likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a workaholic," Secada says with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never complains," says his agent, Jorge Pinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sings from the heart," says his manager, producer and mentor, Emilio 
Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
 The business of being Jon Secada is especially big business because Secada -- 
as pop singer, songwriter and performer -- appeals both to the U.S. mainstream 
pop audience and the nation's estimated 22 million Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spanish-speaking people are probably going to be the biggest-growing market 
in the States," says Estefan, a Cuban immigrant (like Secada) whose other major 
client, wife Gloria Estefan, has already carved out a lucrative English-Spanish 
singing career. 
</P>
<P>
 While Secada's first album, the 1992 "Jon Secada," buoyed by the huge hit 
"Just Another Day," scored with mainstream Anglo audiences, the 
Spanish-language counterpart, "Otro Dia Mas Sin Verte," spawned four No. 1 
singles on Billboard's Latin chart and bagged a Grammy for best Latin pop 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 Secada also walked away with best male artist, best new artist and best album 
in the pop category at last year's Premio Lo Nuestro a La Musica Latina, the 
prestigious Latin equivalent to the Grammys. What's more, a sizable number of 
English-speaking Anglos appear to have bought "Otro Dia Mas." 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day," Secada says, "Anglos tell me that they might not understand 
what I'm singing, but there's immediately more passion in the Spanish versions 
of the songs." 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot of all this cross-cultural pollination: Barely 2 1/2 years into his 
career, Secada has emerged as an enormous star both in the States and in Latin 
America. (Not to mention Europe, Africa and Asia -- his label, SBK Records, 
says Secada's first album was a hit in 20 countries.) 
</P>
<P>
 Critical acceptance has not come so smoothly. Secada's first album was written 
off by critics as facile adult-contemporary popcraft. Some mainstream reviews 
for "Heart, Soul & a Voice" have been more positive, but he's still often 
faulted for writing unashamedly radio-ready material. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Don Heckman, praising Secada's voice as "one of the most flexible . 
. . in pop," concludes that the dance-pop orientation of the new album doesn't 
suit the singer. "Secada has the talent to become a big-time crossover act but 
on this he doesn't get much opportunity to show it," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The same doubts exist among Latin music critics, who generally marvel at his 
commercial success but dismiss his artistic value. 
</P>
<P>
 Among record buyers, though, about the only demographic Secada hasn't 
conquered here is the African American audience, and he and his record company 
are going after it with a vengeance with the new "Heart, Soul & a Voice." The 
collection entered the U.S. pop album charts two weeks ago at No. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, which Secada says is a truer reflection of his muse than the debut 
package, pulses with the sweet, sexy grooves of Earth, Wind & Fire, Marvin Gaye 
and other R&B titans that the singer, the son of black and Latino exiles from 
Cuba, favored while growing up in Hialeah, Fla., the largely Latino 
working-class community north of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the last album, urban radio really wasn't there," says Secada, whose grasp 
of record industry marketing-speak is every bit as fluent as his English and 
Spanish. "But this record, yeah, it's pop, but the flavors are definitely R&B. 
The first song, 'If You Go,' already got accepted by urban radio. I really want 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Hispanic," he adds, "but I'm also African. My roots are just as African 
as any black person who was born here. I consider myself a big melting pot of 
different cultures, which I want to attest to in my music -- kind of talk about 
integration and promote it, because that's what America is about." 
</P>
<P>
 Secada realizes his crossover dreams, however earnestly articulated, could be 
construed as a shameless marketing ploy. "That was definitely a fear," he 
acknowledges. "But so far, the comments are that the stuff is genuine and 
sincere. It's not that this is put on because I'm trying to market myself in a 
certain way. The music speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Secada might still be an unknown in Miami were it not for the Berry Gordy-like 
ministrations of Emilio Estefan, a tireless promoter of the city's rich Cuban 
American talent base. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, Estefan leveraged the Latin-inflected dance hits of his 
band, Miami Sound Machine, into a pop-music cottage industry. At its center was 
MSM lead singer Gloria Estefan, who would later reposition herself as a 
bilingual pop star, setting the crossover precedent for Secada to exploit a 
decade later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Secada, freshly graduated from the University of Miami with a 
master's degree in jazz singing, was teaching at Miami-Dade Community College 
and playing bar mitzvahs. His ambitions, he admits, didn't extend much beyond 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horizon for me was to be a working musician, which I was," Secada says. 
"Teaching, sessions, nightclubs, whatever. I had a house and I was making a 
good living. No problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Then college acquaintances of Secada who were members of Miami Sound Machine 
gave his demo tape to Emilio Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the beginning," Secada says. "At the time, Emilio really wanted 
someone besides Gloria to represent and manage -- a Miami talent, somebody 
bilingual." 
</P>
<P>
 Estefan spent five years grooming his protege, immersing Secada in every 
aspect of the record business, from production to songwriting. "He didn't rush 
it," Secada says. "He wanted me to start out getting my feet wet, learn about 
the business, slowly develop a name and a reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 In due course, Secada proved his mettle by co-writing two No. 1 singles for 
Gloria Estefan -- "Coming Out of the Dark" and "Can't Forget You." He joined 
her 1991 world tour as a backup singer and was given a featured solo spot in 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gloria wanted to help him," Emilio Estefan says. " 'What can I do to help 
this guy to cross over?' It was a great way to show people who Jon Secada was." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the Estefans' munificence, Secada had performed in front of 5 
million people in five countries before scoring a record deal of his own. 
Signed, at last, in 1991 to SBK Records, Secada benefited directly from the 
lessons Estefan had absorbed marketing Miami Sound Machine and then Gloria to 
the Latin and mainstream pop markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I got signed as an Anglo artist, Emilio, from the beginning, said 
to the record company, 'We gotta do this stuff bilingual, there's a big market, 
a lot of potential,' " Secada says. "We didn't intend to record in Spanish 
necessarily -- it was 'Let's pick two songs, see how they do.' So they let me 
do two Spanish songs, versions of 'Just Another Day' and 'Angel' on the English 
album." 
</P>
<P>
 The response to the experiment among Latin radio stations and record buyers 
was overwhelmingly positive, prompting the recording of the "Otro Dia Mas" 
Spanish-language version of "Jon Secada." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Estefan: "His market was really the Anglo market, so the crossover for 
him was really the reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 A fistful of Latin No. 1s and a Grammy later, Secada still marvels at the 
acceptance: "My career in Spanish was overnight superstardom in every sense of 
the word. I didn't know I would get that kind of response from the Latin 
market. I'm very happy I did 'the Spanish songs,' because from Day One, we've 
had both markets." 
</P>
<P>
 And he means to keep them. "Si Te Vas," the Spanish version of the new "Heart, 
Soul & a Voice" album, will be released July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, Secada's first world tour opens Oct. 6, not in the United States 
but in Mexico City, and is scheduled to hit most of Latin America and the 
Caribbean before coming to the States early next year. While Secada will play 
3,000-5,000-seat venues in the United States, his stature in Latin America 
allows him to perform in 20,000-seat stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except Brazil, not much talent goes to these countries," Secada says. "But I 
want to go there because the album did really well, (and to) make a statement 
of performing in these countries that are part of the Latin American world." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Secada consolidates his Pan-Latin audience, it's worth noting that, 
Spanish lyrics and his own ethnic heritage aside, his music has few obvious 
Latin influences. Secada, instead, flies world music's multicultural flag -- he 
browses through a variety of musical lexicons then binds them to sure-fire 
grooves. The approach, says agent Pinos, is well-suited to the programming 
style of Latin radio stations.  
</P>
<P>
 "Spanish radio plays all kinds of music," Pinos says. "A little pop, a little 
rock, a little salsa." The song "Whipped," which opens "Heart, Soul & a Voice," 
summarizes Secada's ability to synthesize influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading off with a trenchant R&B industrial drum track and ominous vocal 
samples, the song mixes soothing Latin inflections on the verses with explosive 
gospel-singer choruses. Secada even tosses in a lusty, soul-man "right on" on 
the fade-out. "I'm very proud of that song," he says. "That's the direction I 
want to get into." 
</P>
<P>
 Given his conservatory training and Estefan's tutelage, there are facets of 
Secada's talent he has probably only begun to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, ever alert to the possibilities of a presentable and 
non-controversial star, has already weighed in with film offers, which Estefan 
thought it wise to turn down. But with Secada's pinup looks, multiracial makeup 
and bilingualism, he is perfectly positioned to exploit the needs of a music 
industry now controlled by conglomerates that depend heavily on overseas sales 
for profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Secada's Pan-culturalism is perfectly suited to a world in which racial and 
national boundaries increasingly blur -- Americans can claim him as one of 
their own, but so can Cubans, Portuguese, Costa Ricans, Spaniards and Mexicans. 
Seen in this context, Secada's sudden stardom seems much less unlikely. It also 
makes an ethnic pop star like Michael Jackson -- who, however strong his appeal 
abroad, will forever be viewed as a U.S. export -- look suddenly out of date. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This afternoon, the business of being Jon Secada is being conducted in the 
wings of the "Friday Night" set. Ringed by klieg lights, publicists and senior 
factotums such as Pinos, Secada perches on a stool and waits patiently to be 
fed rehearsed questions for the show's interview segment. 
</P>
<P>
 The just-wrapped "Tonight Show" taping couldn't have gone much better. Jay 
Leno introduced Secada as "my good friend," and guest Eddie Murphy took time 
out from flogging "Beverly Hills Cop III" to announce he is a big fan and then 
lingered on the couch to watch the singer nail "If You Go." Now Secada, who has 
conducted more than 100 interviews in support of this new album, girds himself 
for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tape is rolling -- waiting for speed," a stage manager barks. "In three, two 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we want to say is congratulations on your success," an 
interviewer off-camera reads from a clipboard. "Your life has changed 
dramatically. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "My life has changed in different ways," Secada murmurs earnestly. "Mainly the 
pace has changed, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold it," says the stage manager, listening to the control booth through his 
headset. "They're not happy with the spot on his left cheek." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinos steps into the lights and examines Secada's face like a plastic surgeon 
prepping a patient. "It looks like a hole," the agent declares. "We don't want 
to see that spot." 
</P>
<P>
 The lights are repositioned and the interview begins again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read a quote recently," says the interviewer, "where you said your life had 
changed dramatically since the debut album. Will you tell us about some of 
those changes?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my life has definitely changed dramatically," Secada says, somehow 
managing to deliver the humble platitudes of a grateful young star without 
sounding like Eddie Haskell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As he speaks, it's hard not to reflect on the events that, somehow, brought 
him to this juncture of his life: 
</P>
<P>
 The bewildering plane flight from Havana to Miami when he was 8 and the 
astonishment at seeing supermarket shelves bulging with food. 
</P>
<P>
 His father's imprisonment in a Castro work camp after a failed first attempt 
to flee to the States. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffee shops that his parents, since retired, ran to support the family in 
Hialeah. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweetness of discovering his voice as a shy teen-ager singing along with 
Philip Bailey, Barry White, the O'Jays, the Spinners. 
</P>
<P>
 And the memory of the administrator at Miami-Dade Community College, who 
assured him that if the singing career didn't work out, he could always come 
back to his teaching gig. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Secada will board a red-eye back to Miami, back to suppers of 
black beans and rice and sweet plantains, back to his new Art-Deco house on the 
ocean that he won't really have time to live in until he comes off the road at 
the end of next year. By then, having taken the business of being Jon Secada 
around the world and vindicating Emilio Estefan's crossover instincts, he plans 
to buy a boat. What kind? 
</P>
<P>
 Secada smiles his handsome smile. "Something fast," he says.

ELTON JOHN AREN'T STRANGERS TO SUCCESS. BUT DISNEY IS DIFFERENT -- PLENTY OF 
FINGERS IN THE SOUP. SO WRITING THE MOVIE'S MUSIC WAS ABOUT PATIENCE TOO

<P>
 Three years ago, if Roy Disney whistled while he worked, it probably wasn't an 
Elton John tune. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't call myself a fan," says the vice chairman of the huge corporate 
entity that bears his uncle's name -- and the "unofficial chairman" of the 
animation world that is the heart of the Walt Disney legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We joke a lot that my knowledge of popular music stopped when Glenn Miller 
stopped recording," he adds. "At least that's what my kids tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, though, Roy Disney -- and just about every other executive in the 
Disney empire -- is whistling Elton John tunes all the way to the bank, and not 
"Benny and the Jets" or "Rocket Man." The songs on their lips are the five that 
John and lyricist Tim Rice wrote for the Disney company's latest animated film, 
"The Lion King," the treachery-filled tale of politics and passions on the 
veld. 
</P>
<P>
 Those five songs cover a vast range of styles and moods. On one end of the 
scale is "Be Prepared," sung with drippingly evil delight by Jeremy Irons in 
the role of the lion villain, Scar -- it's perhaps the darkest number in Disney 
lore. In complete contrast, there's the chipper devil-may-care anthem "Hakuna 
Matata," which is most certainly the only Disney song ever to have an implied 
(though never actually stated) rhyme of the common crude term for passing wind. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical results have spirits -- and sales forecasts -- high throughout 
Disney land. With the movie not even in theaters yet, Walt Disney Records has 
already shipped more than 2 million copies of the soundtrack album, featuring 
the five songs as used in the film, plus three alternate versions featuring 
John's vocals and score instrumental pieces by composer Hans Zimmer.  
</P>
<P>
 That's twice the amount initially shipped for the "Aladdin" soundtrack, which 
went on to sell more than 4 million, becoming the company's all-time top 
release. (For the record, the second-best-seller for the company was 1979's 
"Mickey Mouse Disco," also at more than 4 million.)  
</P>
<P>
 The version of John singing the romantic ballad "Can You Feel the Love 
Tonight" -- which in the film accompanies the blossoming love between the lion 
Simba and his childhood pal/future queen Nala -- is at No. 18 on the Billboard 
pop singles chart, and the soundtrack album debuted at No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, which opens this week in a limited run Los Angeles and New York 
before going nationwide, is also expected to challenge "Aladdin" as the 
top-grossing animated film of all time, and with that in mind, Disney Records 
has also shipped out nearly a million more units of other products, including 
read-along book-tape sets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disney execs, however, weren't so euphoric the first time they first heard the 
"Lion King" tunes. Doubts had already been raised: Could the flashy pop star 
fit into the notoriously staid Disney structure? Would he be able to adapt to a 
system where creative decisions are made by committee?  
</P>
<P>
 As they sat and listened to the first demo tapes from John, those reservations 
loomed large. Lyricist Rice, who with former partner Andrew Lloyd Webber 
reinvented the modern musical with "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Evita" and 
"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" had suggested John as his 
composer for the project after being recruited by Disney chairman Jeffrey 
Katzenberg in 1991, and remembers the chilly reaction to the tapes John had 
sent from England. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, I can tell now, they weren't very excited about the demos," 
says Rice, a tall, casually elegant Englishman, lunching on an omelet and bacon 
at the Disney cafeteria in Burbank. "We had a lovely demo from Elton singing 
'Can You Feel the Love Tonight,' but it's Elton singing at the piano. I don't 
think they could quite relate to it being the voice of the characters. . . . 
They felt like, 'Oh, we're getting Elton John tracks.' I knew they weren't, but 
they didn't know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Disney, looking back on his first hearing of the John-Rice songs, is 
diplomatic. "I think because of the way that Elton does a demo, the songs as we 
first heard them didn't sound anything like what's in the film," he says. 
"There was a certain leap of faith that we should wait and hear the full 
arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, 49, wasn't willing to bank on that faith, though. He knew that this was 
not what the execs were used to. With the songs from "The Little Mermaid," 
"Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin" -- the three animated films that had 
revived the Disney legacy in recent years -- the team of lyricist Howard Ashman 
and composer Alan Menken had used their Broadway musical background to produce 
demos that were literal blueprints for the final product. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into the studio and redid a couple demos on my own with some other 
singers," he says. "I turned ("Can You Feel the Love Tonight") into a duet with 
Lea Salonga and Brad Kane, the two voices from 'Aladdin.' I just hired them as 
session singers, and I put in some jungle noises. I thought, 'Well, if it 
doesn't work then I won't tell anyone about it.' And I did another for the song 
'I Just Can't Wait to Be King.' But it showed them that you had to see beyond 
just Elton doing the songs." 
</P>
<P>
 A hint at what the Disney execs first heard can be found in the three 
John-sung recordings on "The Lion King" album. "Can You Feel the Love Tonight," 
for example, sounds not too unlike such past John ballads as "Don't Let the Sun 
Go Down on Me," while "I Just Can't Wait to Be King," with its frisky rock 
twang, sounds as if it could be a pop singer dreaming of being Elvis rather 
than a lion prince impatient to rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The versions used in the film underwent transformations in arrangement -- with 
Zimmer's orchestral touches and a few hints at the African setting of the film 
replacing John's familiar piano-dominated style (in fact, there's no piano at 
all in the film versions). 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that as the executives sat and listened to the demos, John's work 
was basically done. He'd supplied the requisite catchy tunes, even if the 
Disney bosses couldn't quite hear them in the tapes, and would only need to 
tweak a line here and there.  
</P>
<P>
 Rice's work, though, was just beginning.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've often said, not really joking, that the longer I go in this business, 
the more people tell me how to do my job," Rice says, shrugging. "With 
'Superstar' and 'Evita' and 'Joseph' -- all massive successes -- all the way to 
the last moment it was just two guys creating them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, with Disney it's different. I'll admit that there were a few times 
I wish I had more freedom. It's funny that we seemed to have that freedom when 
we were 18 and broke, and then when you're 48, suddenly the whole world has got 
advice for you."  
</P>
<P>
 By the time the real work began on "The Lion King," Rice had already had a 
trial run with Disney. Shortly after he'd been recruited for the film in 1991, 
Rice was asked to step in to write three songs for "Aladdin" with Menken after 
Ashman's death. 
</P>
<P>
 But the work of finishing up someone else's project didn't fully prepare him 
for taking on a Disney venture from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story line of 'The Lion King,' the basic premise that the young cub would 
be thrown into exile by his wicked uncle and be missing, presumed dead, that 
was always there," Rice says. "That was always the basic principle, but there 
were hundreds of variations in detail." 
</P>
<P>
 And each variation meant a different angle for the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' was the first I wrote for this," he says. 
"The brief was to write a love song, probably a duet, but a straightforward 
love song, which I did. And Elton put a pretty tune to it and I thought, 
'Great, that's a good start.' But they never could find a way to make it work 
within the main film. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried it in outline with the two lions swimming and diving and running 
through the forest, and then it was tried as an argument almost, and then it 
was tried with a heavenly chorus singing offstage while the lions did whatever 
they did, then it was cut and then it was expanded and then we tried it with 
the wart hog and the meerkat singing a parody version. I thought, 'This song is 
never going to get in the film, because it's difficult to animate a slow ballad 
which doesn't advance the plot in most of its forms.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the version that was used combined several of those elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these things happen, which I think makes the scene work," Rice says. "So 
you can take it either as those things, or you can take it as a nice bit of 
corn for two minutes. I don't mind. But Elton said, 'I can't record that 
because I can't sing lyrics that are a wart hog and then a heavenly choir and a 
lioness, so I'm going to sing the original lyrics, because I like them best 
anyway.' So I was thrilled, because I ended up with Take 18 used in the film, 
which works, and Take 1 at the end, sung by Elton, which is the single."  
</P>
<P>
 Rice laughs as he calculates how many changes he had to make on the songs. "I 
mean, you think, 'Three years and I've only ended up with five songs?' " he 
says. "But I tell you, it was a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During those three years, Elton John's main job -- once he'd written the tunes 
-- seemed to be to sit back and allow the Disney machine to do its work. (John, 
busy preparing his own next album and rehearsing for his upcoming tour with 
Billy Joel, refused requests for interviews.)  
</P>
<P>
 "Elton really let me run riot on it," says Zimmer. "I was worried he would 
hate what I did to his songs, taking his babies and giving them new arms and 
legs and eye colors. It gets personal and I really took his stuff apart. But 
he's still speaking to me and that's a good sign."  
</P>
<P>
 Zimmer, though never specifically instructed to incorporate African elements 
into the music, took the opportunity to further explore African sounds that he 
had previously incorporated into his score for the South African-located "A 
World Apart." (Zimmer's other credits include "Rain Man," for which he earned 
an Oscar nomination, "Driving Miss Daisy" and the new "Renaissance Man.")  
</P>
<P>
 The African elements are most prominent in his arrangement of the opening 
"Circle of Life," which features a Zulu choir, directed by Zimmer's past 
collaborator, Lebo Ngema. But he says that he didn't want to overdo that side 
of the music, despite the fact that the story is set in Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Elton John's tune for "Hakuna Matata," the layabout creed constructed 
from a Swahili phrase (meaning, roughly, "don't worry, be happy") sounds more 
like an outtake from "Guys and Dolls" than from "Graceland." Of course, that 
may have something to do with it being sung by the very New York duo of 
Broadway vets Ernie Sabella as the wart hog Pumbaa and Nathan Lane as the 
meerkat Timon. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of my tunes are specifically African," says Zimmer. "I thought it would 
narrow things down if we stuck to one culture like that. I thought it would be 
more interesting if I opened Africa up to Europe and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
 In the context of the songs, he says, his first priority was to be true to the 
material he was given. " 'Circle of Life' definitely sounds like something I 
would have done, but I tried to preserve the thing that is Elton." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Disney company, the biggest thing that is Elton may be his name. Never 
before (unless you count Peggy Lee with "Lady and the Tramp") has a pop star of 
such magnitude lent his talent and name to a Disney project in this way. The 
only potential concern in that regard is that there might be a sense that this 
is an Elton John project, not a Disney film. 
</P>
<P>
 No chance, says Rice. "I don't think so," he says. "Disney is still the main 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those responsible for selling the music, it's the best of both worlds. 
Both "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin" spawned hit pop versions of their key 
ballads, "Beauty and the Beast" and "A Whole New World," respectively. But 
having songs written and sung by Elton John raises the stakes even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney animated music soundtracks have always appealed to a wide variety of 
people," says Mark Jaffe, vice president of Walt Disney Records. "We have 
always had a strong adult purchase, and the Elton presence only adds to that. 
For us, what's unique about this, is not only are we able to appeal to the 
traditional animation market, but the traditional pop market, too."  
</P>
<P>
 So confident is the Disney team that there's already talk about Rice and John 
working together again on another animated film, possibly a Verdi-less 
adaptation of "Aida." And beyond that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never rule out anything around here," says Roy Disney. "Well, 
obviously a couple of things -- probably ain't going to have a rap tune in one 
of these films in the near future, if rap is indeed a tune. But diversity from 
show to show has been one of our strengths in the last years."

ART; OLD HOLLYWOOD'S NEW ARTISTIC JOLT; LACE AND RE:SOLUTION HAVE MOVED FROM 
THE CENTRAL CITY INTO HOLLYWOOD. THE GOAL FOR BOTH ARTS INSTITUTIONS IS A NEW 
ENERGY. BROADER AUDIENCES WOULD BE NICE TOO 
</P>

<P>
 Forget Frederick's of Hollywood's racy underwear, his 'n' hers spike heels in 
every color of the psychedelic rainbow, leather jackets splashed with images of 
Marilyn and Elvis. When you consider the attractions of Hollywood Boulevard, 
think contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequined string bikinis and other bizarre enticements still twinkle in shop 
windows along the legendary thoroughfare, just as transvestites and tourists 
continue to parade on sidewalks embedded with stars named for celebrities. But 
the opening of two nonprofit art institutions -- with public receptions 
Thursday from 7 to 10 p.m. -- has given one block of Hollywood Boulevard an 
infusion of painting, sculpture, photography, video, performance and computer 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, a 15-year-old multidisciplinary forum 
for cutting-edge art, has moved into the former Newberry School of Beauty, at 
6522 Hollywood Blvd., two blocks west of Cahuenga Boulevard. Two doors east, at 
6518 Hollywood Blvd., is RE:SOLUTION, a reincarnation of the 20-year-old Los 
Angeles Center for Photographic Studies, which supports photographic arts, 
video and digital imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Both organizations have forsaken the mean streets of central Los Angeles for 
Hollywood. LACE initially resided above the Victor Clothing Co. on Broadway, 
then moved to Industrial Street, in a warehouse district that has become 
increasingly crime-infested. In its former life, RE:SOLUTION operated a gallery 
at Spring and 8th streets until the neighborhood became too dangerous, then 
relocated at 6th Street and Beaudry Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Tawdry as their new neighborhood may appear, the two institutions consider it 
a step up, and their leaders speak longingly of joining Hollywood's arts 
community and building a broader audience in an area that has such assets as 
pedestrian traffic and convenient parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite fantasy is that everyone will see every show, every video, every 
performance we offer," said Gwen Darien, LACE's executive director. "We have 
the possibility of a public space with an incredibly diverse audience, and we 
want it to be a center of vitality that reflects what goes on in the 
contemporary art world -- not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the world." 
</P>
<P>
 RE:SOLUTION's expanded gallery space will provide an opportunity to display a 
much wider range of art, and heightened visibility will ensure that more people 
see it, said Joe Smoke, director of the photography center. An important factor 
in his organization's new image is a merger with EZ Arts, the nonprofit video 
and digital branch of EZTV. This partnership will allow RE:SOLUTION to become 
"a true gallery of the 21st Century, featuring video screening in the evenings 
and looking ahead to new technology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These aspirations have been hard won, however, and the future of Hollywood's 
new art block is uncertain. After a two-year process that was complicated by a 
change of city administration, following the election of Mayor Richard Riordan, 
LACE and RE:SOLUTION have secured five-year leases with renewal options through 
the Community Redevelopment Agency, in a block owned by the city's Department 
of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-range plans call for building a larger complex and parking structure on 
the site -- perhaps a sort of farmers' market -- but no plan has been adopted 
and financing is not available. Arts institutions could be incorporated in the 
new development, but they would not be its focus, said Lester Burg, assistant 
project manager for the CRA's Hollywood Redevelopment Project, a $1-billion 
plan bordered by La Brea, Fountain, Western and Franklin avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the CRA expects the new arrivals to enhance a redevelopment 
district that already claims about 30 live theaters and has several other arts 
projects in the works. Just west of the art block on Hollywood Boulevard, 
American Cinematheque, a nonprofit center for the appreciation of film and 
video, is remodeling the historic Egyptian Theatre. To the east, the Pacific 
Theater building is being transformed into the Hollywood Entertainment Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Moguls, a cafe-theater-gallery, is already entrenched on the art 
block. And TRI, an adventurous gallery operated by artist Rory Devine, is 
moving to 6365 Yucca St. and opening on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this neighborhood," Darien said, leading a visitor on a tour of LACE's 
new surroundings. "It's urban and gritty. It has some of the qualities that 
were a positive attraction for the downtown space, but it's safer and we have 
accessible, attended, cheap parking." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Kirby, chairman of LACE's board, believes that the move was essential. 
"To stay put -- in the particular part of downtown Los Angeles where LACE was 
located -- would be to die. We are running away from that, but Hollywood 
Boulevard is not exactly the suburbs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one would confuse the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard with a commercial 
district in Palos Verdes Estates or Westlake Village. But for all its rough 
edges and kinky sideshows, the change of address reflects a serious attempt to 
get a grip on LACE's future. Buffeted by a shifting art scene, squeezed by a 
sour economy and embattled by city politics, LACE finally has a chance to 
re-establish itself as a vigorous community arts center, slimmed down and toned 
up for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 LACE was founded in 1978 by a group of 13 artists, most of whom had joined 
forces in East Los Angeles in a program funded by the federal Comprehensive 
Employment Training Act. The organization developed into a lively -- if 
contentious -- exhibition and performance center under the direction of artist 
Marc Pally, from 1979 to 1983, and Joy Silverman, from 1983 to 1990. But 
Silverman's resignation and Roberto Bedoya's subsequent seven-month term of 
leadership coincided with a downturn in the economy and the central city. 
</P>
<P>
 When Darien became director in 1991 -- after 8 1/2 years as deputy director of 
New York's PS1, a well-known contemporary art center -- she took over an 
organization that was troubled by financial woes, falling attendance and 
dissension over the representation of minority artists. Known as an energetic 
and adroit consensus builder, she has presided over a tumultuous period when 
LACE seemed to fade from the scene as its move was delayed. The final 
exhibition, featuring Jean Lowe's work, closed last June. In recent months, 
LACE's video program has been presented at the Ruth Bloom Gallery in Santa 
Monica, while Hollywood Moguls has served as a forum for LACE performances. 
</P>
<P>
 A mission statement defines LACE as "a nonprofit interdisciplinary 
contemporary arts organization that presents art and ideas and serves as a 
forum for an evolving dialogue between both emerging and established artists 
and their audiences." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our challenge in Hollywood is to develop and make clear to the public the 
multidisciplinary nature of the institution," Darien said. "The move allows us 
to fulfill our mission more completely and in a more public way, and to reach 
out beyond people who went downtown because they were interested. We want to 
attract new people as well as sustain our consistent audience." 
</P>
<P>
 A recently completed five-year strategic plan calls for promoting the 
multidisciplinary aspect of the institution, strengthening the program's 
critical context by publishing a brochure or catalogue on each exhibition and 
developing educational programs and public outreach, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is all part of adapting LACE, a so-called alternative space, to the 
present realities of the art scene. Organizations such as LACE were hatched in 
the 1970s as artist-run alternatives to museums and commercial galleries, 
giving artists a place to show experimental work without strictures of 
tradition or the market. But the concept became confused during the boom of the 
1980s, when artists fresh out of school were snapped up by galleries. Then the 
art market crashed, wiping out a large number of galleries and sharply 
curtailing collecting. During the past few years, artists and youthful 
entrepreneurs have taken matters into their own hands by opening shoestring 
commercial operations that show works similar to what might be seen at LACE. 
</P>
<P>
 "The field is wide open now," Kirby said. "The whole art world is trying to 
find out how to operate after the bubble burst. 
</P>
<P>
 "LACE has a history and the momentum of that history, but it's still on the 
fringe. We just want to show good work, as we have always done. LACE is not the 
only place where this work can be shown now, but there are never enough 
spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 LACE's emphasis on video and performance is particularly critical because 
forums for them have always been in short supply in Southern California, Kirby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul McCarthy, a prominent sculptor and performance artist who got a leg up at 
LACE, agrees. "If work doesn't get shown, inevitably it doesn't get made," he 
said, adding that Los Angeles has a dearth of showcases for experimental art. 
</P>
<P>
 Darien calls LACE a contemporary arts center rather than an alternative space. 
</P>
<P>
 " Alternative has a specific meaning -- reacting against something, and 
reacting is a limiting concept," she said. "One of the things we do is to 
provide alternatives to museums, which collect art, and to galleries, which 
sell art. We provide a forum for experimentation, but experimentation doesn't 
mean simply reacting. It's building something as well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LACE's program will be lodged in a building that has undergone little exterior 
change. The stucco and blue tile facade will remain the same, with the 
exception of a splashy LACE sign replacing the old Newberry School of Beauty 
label. Inside, the front room is a 640-square-foot gallery, named for LACE 
patrons Fred and Janet Kessler. The space will be used for exhibitions until 
funds are available to turn it into a cafe-bookstore with window displays of 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want LACE to be an open, accessible place where people meet," said 
architect Frederick Fisher, who designed the renovation, including plans for 
the cafe-bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The main exhibition space -- called the Peter Norton Family Gallery, in honor 
of the Los Angeles-based computer guru and arts philanthropist -- is a 
1,500-square-foot hall with a coved ceiling. To the rear of the building are a 
1,400-square-foot performance space and a 300-square-foot video room for 
single-channel programs and installations. 
</P>
<P>
 The major challenges in overhauling the building were to accommodate LACE's 
programs in a space that is a bit smaller than its former home and to work 
within an extremely low budget, Fisher said. The CRA provided $75,000 for the 
renovation. (General funding for LACE comes from the Arts Organization 
Stabilization Initiative, the California Arts Council, the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Andy Warhol Foundation for 
the Visual Arts and other sources.) 
</P>
<P>
 LACE will launch its new building with "Nor Here Neither There," an exhibition 
of paintings by Suzanne Garrison and Spandau Parks, sculpture by Willie Cole, 
Chris Finley and Nari Ward, photographs by Sharon Lockhart and Lorraine 
O'Grady, video by Doug Aitken, Tom Burr and Stan Douglas, film by Valie Export, 
a spoken-word performance by Cynthia Stewart and a musical performance by 
Mythter. Representing many points of view, the artists hail from various 
California cities, as well as New York, Vancouver and Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 While not construed as a model for future LACE exhibitions, the show's 
curatorial process and its varied contents offer insight into the 
organization's philosophy. Darien appointed not one but four curators -- 
artists McCarthy, Charles Gaines and Stephen Prina, and Fran Seegull, curator 
of the Norton collection and foundation. Working without guidelines, the 
curators proceeded to assemble an exhibition that has no theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "All four of us were interested in exploring alternative methods of curating," 
Seegull said. "We didn't want a theme; we were looking for a more organic 
model." As a result, they each picked artists whose work interested them and 
brought their ideas to a series of meetings. "There was some overlap, but no 
political jockeying," she said. "We continued to meet until the show almost 
curated itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The title, "Nor Here Neither There," refers to LACE's geographical limbo of 
the past year and to a broader perceptual disjuncture between the present and 
the future, she said.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 RE:SOLUTION was founded in 1974, as the Los Angeles Center for Photographic 
Studies, by seven photographers who wanted to expand the boundaries of the 
medium. The center, originally located in a small Westside tract house, in 1981 
opened its first permanent showcase, at 814 N. Spring St. The center developed 
an active program of exhibitions, lectures and workshops, but the 
neighborhood's decline led the organization to move in 1987. After three years 
in a temporary space, it opened a small storefront gallery at 1048 W. 6th St., 
staging exhibitions there and at other local arts institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, renamed RE:SOLUTION, received $40,000 from the CRA to 
renovate its new 3,500-square-foot home, in a storefront formerly occupied by 
New World Jewelry. Architect Josh Schweitzer designed the space to include a 
1,200-square-foot central gallery, a smaller installation space in the back and 
a front window gallery and niche to sell the organization's publication, 
FRAME-WORK: The Journal of Images and Culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural event in the main gallery is the annual members' show, curated 
by Denise Miller-Clark, director of Chicago's Museum of Contemporary 
Photography. "El Palacio del Amor," an installation by Bob de Bris, will 
christen the back gallery, while Marlo Marrero's project "Don't I Know You?" 
will be in the window gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Street-level window displays, such as Marrero's, are expected to entice a new 
audience into both LACE and RE:SOLUTION -- and to present the institutions with 
new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to museums, it's a ritualized experience," LACE's Kirby said. "On 
Hollywood Boulevard, you expect something completely different. This will be 
more like shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 People who wander into the exhibitions won't like everything they see, he 
said. "But when you go shopping, you aren't disappointed if you don't like 90% 
of what you see. And if you don't like everything, you don't stop going."

THEATER; SLIPPING TONY A MICKEY?; AMERICAN THEATER CAN'T DISMISS DISNEY 
DOLLARS, BUT IT CAN DERIDE THE PRODUCT. SO HOW WILL 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' FARE 
AT THE TONY AWARDS? 'PASSION' STANDS IN THE WAY. HOW MUCH MORE DRAMA DO YOU 
NEED?

 "What this year's Tony Awards ceremony needs," says Broadway producer Richard 
Jay-Alexander, "is the theater's equivalent of Tonya Harding and Nancy 
Kerrigan. A real fight-out fraught with tension that'll get people to tune in." 
</P>
<P>
 There's only one category that might qualify among the 20 that will yield 
winners tonight on the 48th annual CBS telecast, and that is the race for one 
of the two top Tonys -- best musical. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional Broadway Establishment, represented by the Shubert 
Organization and the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical "Passion," is facing 
off against the new 800-pound kid on the block -- "Beauty and the Beast," 
produced by Disney, whose well-financed and maverick ways have sent tremors 
through the small, cliquish industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion" leads with 10 nominations, but "Beauty," the most expensive musical 
ever mounted on Broadway, has nine. 
</P>
<P>
 What's at stake is not only prestige and a marketing boost. The winner will 
also signal where the Establishment power stands in an industry increasingly 
anxious about its commercial future (despite the fact that ticket sales are 
up). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Tony Awards are also about art and quality on Broadway, and 
that certainly will play a role in selecting the winners. But, according to 
most insiders, the politics are more pronounced than usual this year, partly 
because neither musical has managed to muster much enthusiasm among the 678 
Tony voters -- producers, the media and representatives of theatrical unions 
and organizations. It's also because the Broadway theater itself appears to be 
in more of a state of flux than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going through a rather convulsive period of time, especially in the 
musical theater," says James Freydberg, a New York producer ("Fool Moon") who 
recently took a lease on the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles. The paucity on 
Broadway of strong, influential activist voices like the late Joseph Papp's has 
taken its toll. "Nobody knows what to do," Freydberg added, "so they're doing 
revivals. That's not producing, that's presenting. Things seem to be in an odd 
holding pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the best musical revival category has four strong contenders -- 
"Carousel," "She Loves Me," "Grease" and "Damn Yankees." But the Tony 
nominating committee practically had to be whipped and hogtied to come up with 
four best musical nominees. A minor scandal erupted on the day the nominations 
were announced because the committee balked at adding the two other shows that 
were eventually nominated -- "Cyrano," a Dutch import based on the Edmond 
Rostand classic, and "A Grand Night for Singing," a Rodgers and Hammerstein 
musical revue -- both of which have closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have understood if they'd eliminated that category altogether," said 
producer Margo Lion ("Jelly's Last Jam"). " 'Beauty and the Beast' really is a 
world apart. It doesn't have anything to do with what the rest of us are doing. 
And 'Passion'? It's new and daring, but its appeal is not very broad. So what 
you have is one show of limited artistic quality and wide commercial appeal 
pitted against a show of ambitious artistry and limited accessibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like both musicals," said Robert Straus, a Broadway general manager. "The 
problem is that there are only two productions to show for a whole season. I'd 
like more choice." 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence, "Beauty and the Beast" and "Passion" share themes. Both 
inspired by movies, the musicals, to some extent, are about physical and 
spiritual beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Disney's enormously popular animated feature, "Beauty and the Beast" 
is an extravagant $12-million retelling of the 18th-Century French fairy tale 
about an ugly beast in an enchanted castle who tries to win the heart of a 
bookish young girl. 
</P>
<P>
 When the show opened last March at the Palace, many reviewers likened it to a 
Disney theme-park event and spent about as much space on the all-stops-out 
merchandising in the lobby as on the all-stops-out production. Damp notices, 
however, had little effect at the box office and the show is this season's 
hottest ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion" is the musical adaptation of a 19th-Century Italian novel of dark 
and obsessive love. The fatal attraction here is between a plain, consumptive 
woman and a handsome soldier. Unlike the cuddly pair at the heart of the Disney 
spectacular, Fosca and Giorgio are an intense but doom-ridden duo, playing out 
their disturbing and dissonant affair in a severe and cerebral $4.5-million 
production at the Plymouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a troubled preview period in New York, the show opened to mixed but 
respectful notices. Buoyed by the magical name of Stephen Sondheim, the 
adventurous show has been drawing moderately well, but most people agree that 
it must win the Tony to have a viable run, because of its difficult subject 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If "Passion" prevails, there is speculation that "Disney-bashing," as it has 
been characterized in the press, will have had something to do with it. Much 
has been written about the less-than-warm welcome extended by the theater 
Establishment to the rich and powerful entertainment conglomerate since its 
arrival on Broadway. Eyebrows were immediately raised when Disney chose a 
director, choreographer and set designer whose experience stemmed largely from 
creating theme-park productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving notice that they intended to do things their own way, including putting 
up all the money themselves, Disney's executives aroused the envy and 
skepticism of many of Broadway's elite, who have to scramble, sometimes for 
years, to raise financing for a show. In an industry with so few major players, 
there was concern that a company with such deep pockets might shift the 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been entirely surprised by the so-called 'bashing,' " said Robert 
McTyre, who produced "Beauty and the Beast" for Disney. "But we're getting 
standing ovations every night and selling out, so we did something right. We 
have a particular point of view and appeal and we believe there's room for that 
on Broadway and for 'Passion' as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broadway community's mixed feelings have been compounded by the Disney 
Co.'s commitment to renovate 42nd Street's New Amsterdam Theatre, thus 
spearheading the long-delayed redevelopment of the tawdry Times Square area. 
When news of Disney's deal with the city, which included tax abatements and a 
low-interest $21-million loan, first surfaced, longstanding Broadway theater 
owners protested they were entitled to some of the same favorable tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still many producers have expressed the hope that Disney's muscle will help to 
bring down steep union costs that are making musicals prohibitively expensive 
to mount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted that Disney's on Broadway," said producer John Hart of Kardana 
Productions, which co-produced "Guys and Dolls" and "Tommy." "I think 'Beauty 
and the Beast' misses on the emotions, but its sense of spectacle will bring a 
lot of new and younger people into the theater. Quite frankly, I worry about 
them turning Times Square into a theme park. I don't want to come to work in a 
monorail and get my morning cup of coffee from Minnie Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
 A more commonly stated fear is that a company as rich as Disney will 
repeatedly come up with the money to create a product that will do little to 
advance -- and may even be detrimental -- to the art form of theater itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even the Broadway pros have not exactly been successful with 
musicals this season. Harold Prince and Tommy Tune -- the two directors most 
successful in combining artistry with commerce in the proportions that Tony 
voters love -- are notably absent from among the nominees. Tune had a 
disastrous flop with "The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public" last month and 
Prince's new show is a revival of "Showboat," a 67-year-old musical that opened 
in Toronto and won't be in New York until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Davidson, artistic director of Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum, which is 
nominated as co-producer of three of the four best play nominees ("Twilight," 
"Perestroika," "Kentucky Cycle"), suggests that too much emphasis is being 
placed on "Beauty and the Beast" as the litmus test of future Disney 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money can't buy quality," he says. "But it can't hurt. The next venture for 
Disney will tell us more than 'Beauty,' and it may not be quite so easy to 
adapt in the same way. They're very smart people. I think they've learned a lot 
and may reach out to more traditional artists next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's McTyre agrees that may be the case but thinks the repeated 
comparisons to theme-park entertainment are "ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do things that are Disney-branded, but we're going to look for 
original things as well."  
</P>
<P>
 Where "Beauty and the Beast" to a certain extent came to Broadway as a 
pre-sold hit, "Passion" took a more perilous route. Unlike most original 
American musicals, which these days go through years of development and 
workshop productions, the latest Sondheim-Lapine collaboration was in previews 
within six months of its only workshop production at Lincoln Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would send a terrific signal if 'Passion' won," the Taper's 
Davidson said. "It's great whenever works that are of a certain boldness and 
ambition can be acknowledged. It encourages risk-taking from other quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a writer in the theater, I see a growing tendency toward frivolousness," 
said writer-director Richard Maltby ("Miss Saigon"). "Steve's on the artistic 
cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for all the reverence and respect accorded to Sondheim by the Broadway 
community, there is still a nagging sense among some that a vote for the 
esoteric "Passion" over "Beauty" sends a misleading signal to the general 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the lyrics of 'Company' better than the national anthem," says John 
Hart, "but I'm not comfortable voting for 'Passion.' Broadway is in danger of 
becoming like opera -- too expensive, too elite and no longer part of people's 
vocabularies. When I attended 'Passion,' I was stunned by its failures to 
connect with an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 A Broadway press agent who wished to remain anonymous put it even more 
bluntly. " 'Passion' needs the win to stay alive," he says, "but it won't 
promote Broadway business in the long run. If the average tourist goes to see 
it because it won the Tony over, say, seeing 'Crazy for You,' then it's likely 
to scare them off. The effect of it winning will be fascinating, if ironic. 
After all, the Tony is supposed to not only promote excellence, but also 
promote Broadway business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is neither Sondheim nor Disney's responsibility, of course, to create 
products that will please the Tony voters. In the end, awards often have little 
to do with real merit. The recent past is littered with examples of musicals 
that won the best musical Tony and never recouped their investment while on 
Broadway ("Will Rogers Follies" is one). Furthermore, Sondheim's "Sunday in the 
Park With George," which lost to "La Cage aux Folles" in 1984, appears to be 
growing in stature as "La Cage" recedes into memory. 
</P>
<P>
 While many voters express the wish that they could vote on nominees that more 
confidently combined artistic excellence with commercial appeal, the problems 
with the Broadway musical will persist long after the envelopes are discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sadness in the American theater at this moment is that even many of our 
hits are not new work," Maltby said. "Even 'Tommy' is 25 years old. Leave Steve 
(Sondheim) out and there are not many new and talented creators around, and I'm 
not sure that Disney's arrival on the scene is going to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what the irony is in all this," said one voter. "Steve's Oscar is 
for 'Sooner or Later,' a song from 'Dick Tracy' that Disney produced, and James 
Lapine's last movie, 'Life With Mikey,' was also released by one of their 
companies. We may all end up working for Disney, sooner or later."

THE TANGLE OVER 'TWILIGHT'; ANNA DEAVERE SMITH, JOURNALIST? ANNA DEAVERE SMITH, 
PLAYWRIGHT? HER 'TWILIGHT: LOS ANGELES, 1992' HAS BEEN BOTH HAILED AS A 
SENSATION AND BESET BY DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE PIECE IS A PLAY OR JUST 
REPORTAGE. WHO'S RIGHT, TONY OR PULITZER?

<P>
 Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman play about the riots, "Twilight: Los Angeles, 
1992," now struggling to survive on Broadway after six weeks despite rapturous 
reviews and standing ovations, could gain additional longevity and respect if 
it wins either of the two major Tony Awards for which it is nominated tonight 
in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Since its prominent premiere last year at the Mark Taper Forum, which 
commissioned it, "Twilight" has been both hailed as a sensational theatrical 
event and bedeviled by disagreement in the theater community and press as to 
how it should be measured -- whether it is truly a work of the imagination and 
therefore pure dramatic art, or whether it is a form of journalism as 
performance art and therefore something less. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument was highlighted a few weeks ago when this year's Pulitzer Prize 
jury in drama disallowed "Twilight" for final consideration on the grounds that 
its language was not invented but gleaned from interviews. That it was even 
being discussed by the Pulitzer jury was an indication of how high the play had 
soared in the minds of some critics, while the decision to disqualify it for 
technical reasons might have been puzzling to anyone aware that the previous 
year's Pulitzer jury had judged Smith's earlier show "Fires in the Mirror" 
(similarly developed and performed, about ethnic battles in Brooklyn) a 
legitimate runner-up for the 1992 prize. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tony nominating committee evidently had no such qualms about "Twilight," 
but to further confuse the general public, some will notice that while 
"Twilight" is one of the four Broadway plays up for best play (along with Tony 
Kushner's "Perestroika," Robert Schenkkan's "The Kentucky Cycle" and Arthur 
Miller's "Broken Glass"), the play that won this year's Pulitzer, Edward 
Albee's "Three Tall Women," is not represented tonight. That's because "Three 
Tall Women" is playing Off Broadway, and the Tonys stubbornly limit themselves 
(yes, still) to shows playing inside the geographical boundaries of the 
historic theater district in houses with at least 500 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to theater awards, it's good to keep in mind that there are 
often matters of real estate involved, and in the case of the Pulitzer, the 
internal politics of the jury. Regardless, the debate over "Twilight's" 
worthiness for these traditional honors is not so surprising given that it 
seems to be a wholly new form, dazzling but unfamiliar -- and therefore a 
challenge and threat to established boundaries of official approbation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the debate is confounding all the same to those who believe that the first 
measure of any play or theater work -- especially in today's beleaguered 
theater world -- is whether it makes itself felt so strongly that people want 
to see it. And this certainly was true of "Twilight" in Los Angeles, where in 
its last weeks it broke box-office records for the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a San Francisco-based actress, assembled the two-hour piece from 200 
tape-recorded interviews she conducted with all manner of people involved in or 
affected by the three days of violence and civil disturbance that began April 
29, 1992. She described the intention of "Twilight" as "my search for the 
character of Los Angeles in the wake of the initial Rodney King verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 She revealed that character through her uncanny impersonations of roughly two 
dozen of the people she had interviewed, stretching her talent for mimicry from 
the voices of public figures like Reginald O. Denny, Daryl Gates and Stanley 
Sheinbaum to anonymous citizens white, black and brown. In a series of 
fast-moving monologues, she painted a swirling collage of a city at war with 
itself. And she did this, under the circumstances, with a considerable amount 
of humor and entertainment value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The effect Smith achieved onstage was impressive, but what was she doing 
exactly? Or did it matter what we called it? It was not a play like "Our Town" 
or "Death of a Salesman," nor was it a personal monologue of the kinds 
popularized by such writer-actors as Spalding Gray and Eric Bogosian. 
</P>
<P>
 It was nonfiction, but interpretive nonfiction, a theatrical relation perhaps 
to the literary forms of "nonfiction novelists" like Truman Capote, Norman 
Mailer and Joseph Wambaugh who combined reporting with novelistic narratives. 
Who remembers -- probably not this year's Pulitzer jury in drama -- that 
Mailer's 1979 book, "The Executioner's Song," based on many tape-recorded 
interviews, won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction , when most people took it to be 
a nonfiction account of the life and death of convicted murderer Gary Gilmore? 
</P>
<P>
 For that matter, Robert Sherwood's 1938 play, "Abe Lincoln in Illinois," 
borrowed largely from Lincoln's writings and speeches and was awarded the 
Pulitzer. "A Chorus Line," built by Michael Bennett and James Kirkwood from 
interviews with Broadway dancers, won the prize in 1975. There are many more 
examples of successful stage plays -- Jay Presson Allen's "Tru," Eric Bentley's 
"Are You Now or Have You Ever Been?," "The Diary of Anne Frank," by Frances 
Goodrich and Albert Hackett -- that were shaped from the words of real people 
collected from existing writings or transcriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for the roots of Smith's "Twilight" method in so-called "documentary 
theater," one looks all the way back to the fabled Living Newspaper of the 
Federal Theatre Project during the 1930s, the Group Theater's "Waiting for 
Lefty," by Clifford Odets (that addressed the 1937 New York taxi strike) or to 
the earlier Taper shows "In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer" (1968) and 
"The Trial of the Catonsville 9" (1971). There is, of course, the work of Emily 
Mann ("Still Life" and "Execution of Justice"), who directed "Twilight" at the 
Taper. Even so, there seems to be no clear precedent for what Smith has done at 
this professional level. She appears to have established a new genre, and at 
the moment she is a genre of one. This is a mixed blessing at awards time. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also been nominated for best featured actress in "Twilight," but 
traditionalists in the theater may not be ready to grant her full status as a 
writer, as an established older American playwright confided to me recently, 
while requesting anonymity. "It's an eloquent performance all right, but 
there's a lot of concern among Tony voters that it's not a play," said the 
playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Schenkkan, author of "The Kentucky Cycle," which won the 1992 Pulitzer 
and is nominated for a Tony tonight, holds a similar view. "From a 
dramaturgical point of view, it's not a work of the imagination," said 
Schenkkan. "This is not to take anything away from her performance, which is 
amazing. I think of it as performance art, not as a play." 
</P>
<P>
 Others feel differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be an issue for some critics and some people in the 
theater," said Emily Mann, a leading proponent and practitioner of documentary 
theater. "But a lot of writing, if you will, goes into one of these pieces. 
There's an incredible amount of craft involved. You still have to make a play." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was wonderful," said Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright who won 
the Pulitzer in 1989 for "The Heidi Chronicles" and one who speaks up in 
Smith's behalf. "I think of it as a work of art. There is an individual voice 
there, the eye of the observer. It's constructed in a theatrical way. It moves. 
It's documentary theater but it's different from 'docudrama' because she's 
dealing with character. It begins with character, which is what it has in 
common with a lot of other plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Moore, who directed the Pulitzer-winning " 'night Mother" on Broadway and 
the radio documentary play "Top Secret: The Battle for the Pentagon Papers" for 
L.A. Theatre Works, said about "Twilight": "It's the way one shapes reality 
that makes theater. Not anyone could come up with a way of doing that. There's 
an argument to be made that she did write part of it since she asked the 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theater is becoming a form that no one thinks is relevant, and here is a 
piece that has shown relevance and vibrancy, that is important, clever and 
well-done. So why in the world should it be excluded?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That connection that is made between the stage and an audience and between 
the audience and the artist, that is what the theater is about," said Lloyd 
Richards, director of August Wilson's plays "Fences" (Pulitzer, 1987) and "The 
Piano Lesson" and for 30 years director the National Playwrights Conference. 
Did he consider "Twilight" a play? "Categorizing it is something that's imposed 
on it. It's not what the art is about. One can say about something, what is the 
creative element in it? Sometimes assemblage is creative. I was moved or I was 
provoked or I was enraged or I was entertained by it. That's where it's at." 
</P>
<P>
 Oskar Eustis, a director at the Taper who worked with Smith as an adviser 
during the development of "Twilight," made this observation: "Categories are 
invented before an art form is invented. When you have category confusion, the 
artists are usually ahead of the judges." 
</P>
<P>
 During the years he was running the Eureka Theatre in San Francisco, Eustis 
commissioned and directed "Execution of Justice," about the trial of Dan White, 
the man who murdered San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and city Supervisor 
Harvey Milk. "Just the act of putting on that play for that community over and 
over again was an act of reliving these events that we had so far failed to 
process," he said. "And thus we made in the theater an event take place that 
could only happen in the theater. You needed to be surrounded by other people 
from the same community. You couldn't be sitting in front of your television 
set." 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition of taking real-life events and finding a way to put them on the 
stage that both reflects the immediacy of news reporting and the thematic 
complexity of a work of art is one of the ways theater has of being different 
from the museum or the ballet, he pointed out. "It's a grubby, immediate art 
form, and yet it is an art form." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There remains the question about "Twilight": Will it last? Shouldn't the 
projected durability of a play or book or movie be a measure of its greatness 
or lack thereof? Probably, except that this is the most difficult of all 
standards to apply with any accuracy, given a glance at history. How many 
"classics" of just the last 25 years in the theater already qualify as answers 
to trivia questions? 
</P>
<P>
 "Twilight" seems a piece very much of the moment, an address to a city by a 
visitor who spent some time here and summed up her thoughts for the stage. But 
should this diminish its value? The Pulitzer jury concluded that Smith's work 
"is not reproducible by other performers because it relies for its authenticity 
on the performer's having done those interviews." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith herself disputes this conclusion and reasoning. But call it truth or 
call it fiction, it is hard to imagine an Anna Deavere Smith show without Anna 
Deavere Smith. Trying to read "Twilight" is only a little more fruitful than 
trying to read "A Chorus Line" or "Phantom of the Opera." And in any case the 
published version differs significantly both from the staged version seen at 
the Taper and the one now on Broadway, which was altered again under a new 
director, George C. Wolfe, adding new characters (including a laughing Keith 
Watson, co-assailant of Reginald O. Denny).  
</P>
<P>
 In a way, this continuous tinkering is just an additional problem for anyone 
trying to measure Smith for a formal gown of respectability. Because she is up 
to something else, asking audiences and the authorities to look at theater 
fundamentally as a work in progress, taking place one night at a time. This is 
possibly a radical idea.

SUCH HAPPY SONGS; OSCAR LEVANT DREAMED OF MAKING GREAT MUSIC, INSTEAD HE BECAME 
A GENIUS OF TALK; THE LIFE AND TIMES OF OSCAR LEVANT, BY SAM KASHNER AND NANCY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar Levant, from all accounts (and especially his own), was not a happy man: 
"Instant unconsciousness has been my greatest passion. . . . My life is a 
morbid rondo. . . . Every moment is an earthquake to me." He was all words and 
few artistic deeds: "I am a throbbing wound waiting to be aggravated. . . . 
Anger is my chief raison d'e tre. " Anger against success and anybody who 
mentioned roses, death, the number 13, Sara Lee cakes, Pittsburgh. If you 
wished him good luck before a concert, you'd be in line for a smack in the 
kisser and a Levantine exit with the famous scowl. Once, pilled to the gills, 
he tried to throttle his ever-loving wife. He was not a happy man. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet looking at the tally of his professional life, the fellow seemed to have 
it made. A Renaissance prince of all media, Levant racked up hit songs ("Blame 
it on My Youth"), boffo movies ("Rhapsody in Blue," "An American in Paris"), 
early-shock TV shows ("The Oscar Levant Show") and best-selling chat-books 
("The Memoirs of an Amnesiac"). His All-Gershwin concerts were SRO. A household 
name by the '40s, he also had a loving wife and family plus a swell home in 
Beverly Hills. Who could ask for anything more? 
</P>
<P>
 But, as he said in the movie "Humoresque": "It's not what you are but what you 
don't become that hurts." He didn't become a great American composer, like the 
buddy he envied, George Gershwin. He didn't become a world-class pianist like 
his friend Vladimir Horowitz. And though he "loved songs more than anything" 
and knew everything about them, his musically illiterate colleague Irving 
Berlin outclassed him by light years. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Grove Dictionary of American Music awards him one small paragraph, the 
same space as Eddie Leonard, minstrel writer of "Ida! Sweet as Apple Cider." 
Gershwin gets 13 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Scott Fitzgerald said about Gatsby, "If personality is an unbroken 
series of successful gesture, then there was something gorgeous about him." 
Levant was a Gorgeous Man, a genius of talk. For he left a legacy of verbal 
humor, a well of truth, a stand-up comic's dream of one-liner bull's-eyes -- 
Doris Day: "I knew her before she became a virgin"; Elizabeth Taylor: "Always 
the bride and never the bridesmaid"; Leonard Bernstein: "He has been disclosing 
musical secrets that have been well-known for over four hundred years." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a kid his mother said cuttingly, "You'll never be (the charismatic 
Polish pianist) Paderewski, but you'll never be lonely." Knock-kneed, 
damp-haired and shop-soiled, Oscar was nevertheless considered sexy by many 
women. He also had limpid eyes, a sensuous mouth and helpless air. Despite his 
devilish tongue, he had adoring friends who had the privilege of experiencing 
his fine arts offstage, at home -- the best setting for Oscar, the indoors man: 
slouched at the piano, fingering the keys as if they were voluptuous anatomy, 
wearing his trademark rumpled dark suit with its filigree of cigarette ash, 
playing Bach while reading Camus and humming along to a Beethoven sonata on the 
phonograph. His friend Harpo Marx, at whose house Oscar had encamped, once 
walked in on him in this supreme act of a Renaissance man. Without raising his 
head from his book, Oscar grunted, "Harpo, why don't you loath me like 
everybody else? Don't you like me?" 
</P>
<P>
 "A Talent For Genius," written by two married poets, is a straightforward, 
serious and sensible account of a shambolic life. Levant's own chat-books, 
reeking of his personality and both sunnier and funnier, are much used and 
quoted. But this long book, full of cautionary tales, is the definitive tale of 
Oscar. Even though there are times when one begs for no more "Rhapsody in Blue" 
or descriptions of "bipolar illness" and "obsessive-compulsive disorder," one's 
eyes are misty at the end: old Oscar struggling up his stairs, worn out from 
piano practice, breathing with difficulty, to die peacefully on his bed, his 
beautiful hands of stained glass folded neatly on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Beverly Hills cop was told the name of the deceased, he registered no 
recognition. For this was the forgetful world of the 1970s when rock culture 
was steamrolling over the old world of witty, literate Broadway/Hollywood. 
Today in the noisy and meaningless wasteland of talk television, we need more 
than ever the well-read, well-tempered presence of Oscar Levant (sparing, of 
course, his nicotine habit and slight homophobia). 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Levant's Time is evoked only sketchily here, mostly in long laundry 
lists (and there's a lamentable ignorance of Tin Pan Alley, one of Oscar's 
favorite places). So we shall concentrate on the Life side of this 
night-loving, pavement-hugging romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 His was the typical background of a turn-of-the-century American entertainer: 
Russian-Jewish parents, outsiders, who demanded orthodoxy within their 
Pittsburgh ghetto and a future in the professions for their sons. Luckily there 
was music in the home and a get-up-and-go spirit. Three of the sons, including 
Oscar, would provide music for Al Jolson, another outsider and full of 
chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar sacrificed his boyhood to learn classical piano, and he was soon 
sight-reading like nobody's business and smoking 5-cent cigars. This was at age 
12. At 15, with a phobia for lemons and the 1812 Overture, he was left in New 
York to finish his piano studies. Here he blossomed as a musician, despite 
Paderewski's judgment that though he had technique he'd never have "the soul of 
a concert pianist." This hit hard in his already hypersensitive gut. He found 
solace in vaudeville, ragtime and Al Jolson. The self-styled "World's Greatest 
Entertainer" was the epitome of sassy syncopated American pop culture and an 
antidote to snobby East Coast Establishment attachment to all things European. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Oscar was playing "flash" piano with dance bands, elbowing with the 
one-fingered songwriters of Tin Pan Alley and suffering an attack of the vapors 
upon discovering George Gershwin songs and "Rhapsody in Blue." A romantic 
fascination was about to begin. With cockiness and word-power, he won his way 
into the salons of the emperors of Broadway, making them laugh when he 
described Sigmund Romberg's ballads as music "you whistle on the way into the 
theatre." Columnists like Walter Winchell came begging for his one-liners; the 
press started a love affair with Oscar and he adored an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually he wangled his way into the Gershwin household. The first meeting 
established the perimeters of the relationship: Oscar played George his 
recording of "Rhapsody in Blue" and the composer said, "I like mine better." 
Everybody knew Oscar was by far the better pianist. Even so, Oscar was hooked, 
and worship of Gershwin became, in his own words, "a neurotic love affair." For 
weeks he would camp out at the Gershwin family home. George never returned the 
love, but he did find Oscar useful as a rehearsal pianist. Self-confident, 
sartorial and sporting a fake upper-class accent, George was the opposite of 
rumpled, crumpled Oscar. He had him around as an all-licensed Fool, allowing 
the boy to barb at him: "Tell me, George, if you had to do it all over, would 
you fall in love with yourself again?" 
</P>
<P>
 George got his revenge when they shared a railroad sleeping car and the great 
composer assumed the comfortable lower berth. "Upper berth -- lower berth," 
said George. "That's the difference between talent and genius." Oscar's own art 
music was praised for its "high seriousness," and his movie songs were good but 
not great. He suffered from artistic inertia, and while his contemporaries 
forged ahead with their songs and scores, he was filled with rage followed by 
regret. He phoned his friend David Raksin about Raksin's "Force of Evil" score: 
"That is what I should have been writing!" 
</P>
<P>
 With Gershwin's death in 1937, Oscar came into his own -- as the best 
interpreter of his idol's concert works, as America's highest-paid concert 
artist and as a top seller on Columbia Records. But with success came excess -- 
too many sleeping pills, phobias and silly rituals. When he became a household 
name through his appearances as a music/sports expert on the popular egghead 
radio quiz show "Information, Please," he also wore the same clothes, washed or 
not, and tipped the same legless beggar. Some demon was telling him that this 
fame was fleeting and worthless, even though Average American Joe got a kick 
out of Oscar's easy street erudition. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio fame catapulted Oscar into movie roles, as the hero's sidekick, and he 
turned out to be excellent at the art of being Oscar. But, as usual, when 
success beckoned he liked to self-destruct. The shadow of Gershwin and the 
"left undone" enveloped him in darkness. Seconal, Nembutal, Demerol -- the 
witches were ready to take him to that paradise of unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 1940s were his peak, then the 1950s were a downhill slide. A temporary 
therapy for his drug addiction came in the shape of local L.A. television 
appearances -- buttoned-up Eisenhower era viewers had witnessed nothing like 
it: when Marilyn Monroe was married to Arthur Miller by a rabbi, Oscar 
commented, "Now that Marilyn is kosher, Arthur Miller can eat her." On "The 
Oscar Levant Show," the blinking, shaking host was able to show his all-round 
intellectualism: Aldous Huxley talked up LSD, Christopher Isherwood reeled off 
Baudelaire and Jerry Lewis read "The Waste Land" in an effeminate voice. 
</P>
<P>
 But the almighty networks would have none of this elevating, though popular, 
brew -- they stuck to chewing gum. When he was suspended for insulting a local 
sponsor, Frank Lloyd Wright, not noted for his TV viewing, telegrammed support 
for Oscar. It must be admitted that his washing of dirty family laundry in 
public presaged the confessional tabloid TV to come -- his video accounts of 
battles with June were a voyeur's dream: "It's too late for sweets and too soon 
for flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 However, lily time was nigh, though there were to be no flowers at the 
Westwood Memorial Cemetery when his abused body was laid to rest in August, 
1972. Wrote journalist Burt Prelutsky: "Behind the facade of the world's oldest 
enfant terrible lurked the sweetest, warmest, most vulnerable man." Vanished 
was not just the waspish intelligence of the epigrammatic pianist but also a 
civilized era when mass entertainment could embrace a figure capable of 
connecting high and low culture, who could talk as easily with Al Jolson as 
with Dmitri Shostakovich.

 "Happiness is not a thing you experience but something you remember," said

the old curmudgeon to know he's made a new friend happy -- whether he likes it

A TREASURE HUNT; THE RAPE OF EUROPA: THE FATE OF EUROPE'S TREASURES IN THE 
THIRD REICH AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR, BY LYNN H. NICHOLAS (ALFRED A. KNOPF: 
$27.50; 498 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Olivier Bernier, Olivier Bernier's most recent book is Fireworks at Dusk, 
Paris in the Thirties (Little, Brown).

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looting, for the last 40 centuries or so, has been the inevitable companion of 
war. From the sack of Troy to Napoleon's many appropriations of cultural goods, 
the conquerors have felt free to help themselves to whatever was most 
desirable. That the Nazis, then the Soviets, should have done the same during 
the last world war is no surprise; but even so, the scale of this vast, highly 
organized thieving remains hard to believe. Now, in an admirably documented 
book, "The Rape of Europa," Lynn H. Nicholas has set out to give us a full 
account of who took what, and how. The result is a book which is at the same 
time fascinating and horrifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniquely, the looting began well before the war. Because the Nazis, who came 
to power in 1933, held that "degenerate art" must be suppressed, they demanded 
the removal of all such objects from the collections of the German museums, 
thus despoiling them of extensive holdings of Impressionist, 
Post-Impressionist, Expressionist and abstract works, along, of course, with 
anything made by a Jewish artist. Nor were the museums alone in being attacked 
by the new regime: the Jews soon found themselves not merely discriminated 
against, but exposed to confiscations of all kinds. So it was that the kind of 
large-scale, state-sponsored robbery which had, until then, been associated 
with military campaigns took place within the unbreached borders of a country 
at peace with its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 This made perfect sense to anyone who knew Hitler: A failed painter and 
designer, the boundlessly ignorant Fuhrer considered himself a connoisseur. 
That in itself might not have mattered as his taste ran to 19th-Century 
Academic mediocrities: any such work, taken from the national collections for 
the Fuhrer's residences, was hardly likely to be missed. Far worse, kultur was 
an essential part of his New Order. Thus, together with the reordering of 
public collections, Hitler established an ambitious acquisition program -- both 
for himself and for the Reich. Just how ambitious became clear with the 
takeover of Czechoslovakia and Austria: in both cases, these countries ceased 
to exist; in both cases all Jewish possessions were seized; as for the museums, 
they found themselves forced to make highly unequal exchanges when they were 
not altogether despoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 That was only a beginning. The Nazi conquest of Poland did more than give the 
Germans Lebensraum: All works of Germanic origin, like the admirable Veit Stoss 
sculpture altarpiece in Cracow, were simply sent to German museums; other 
desirable pieces like the Leonardo "Lady With an Ermine" were taken by the Nazi 
General Governor Hans Frank or sent to the planned Hitler Museum at Linz; and 
some, of course, were simply seized for a variety of Nazi dignitaries, Goering 
first and foremost. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some small measure of legality was preserved in Austria, Poles, being 
Slavs, were officially considered to be subhuman. From the Nazi viewpoint, 
therefore, it was positively meritorious to take their possessions, and the man 
put in charge of these robberies on the vastest scale was none other than the 
cretinous Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi theoretician and author of "The Myth of 
the Twentieth Century." Still, it was not until July, 1940, that, by Hitler's 
order, the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (Rosenberg Task Force) was 
created. Its mission was to seize all Jewish-owned cultural goods in the newly 
conquered countries of Eastern and Western Europe, while at the same time 
forcing state institutions, the great museums first and foremost, to make 
"exchanges" that would redound to the advantage of Germany. Of course, that did 
not prevent plain old-fashioned looting. Nicholas cites an eyewitness who 
visited Poland in October, 1939, for instance, and reported that "the ruins of 
the Royal Palace in Warsaw had become a sort of open bazaar for German 
officials. Governor General (Hans) Frank himself, on his first tour of the 
castle with a large entourage, had not set the best example when he tore the 
silver eagles off the canopy over a throne and pocketed them." 
</P>
<P>
 That, indeed, was a typical scene. For the rest of the war, and in an area 
that eventually stretched from the suburbs of Moscow to those of Naples, the 
Nazis competed for the spoils, all the spoils. Rosenberg's outfit, of course, 
had many rivals -- not just the military on the scene, but the Nazi leaders as 
well, in hierarchical order. 
</P>
<P>
 First naturally, there was Hitler. Having decided to make the small Austrian 
city of Linz the cultural capital of Central Europe, he planned a vast complex 
of museums for which only the best would do, providing it was properly Aryan 
and Northern -- Vermeer and Rembrandt were high on the list. Many works of 
lesser quality were also included, however: neither the Fuhrer nor his agents 
knew much about art. There was, for instance, the totally incompetent Frau 
Dietrich. "Her very special relationship with (Hitler) through Eva Braun is the 
only possible explanation for the amazing leeway she was given in her dealings. 
Between 1940 and 1944 she bought some 320 paintings in Paris. . . . A lot of 
these were bad pictures, and no small number were fakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reich's No. 2 man, Goering was no less greedy; almost any famous artist 
would do. In the past, his lack of knowledge had led him to buy fakes and 
fifth-rate works; now he found himself able to acquire famous paintings in 
great quantities, some from the Rothschild and other Jewish collections, others 
as "gifts" from leading European museums. And next in line came the rest of the 
Nazi hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, as Nicholas points out, was an unprecedented movement of great 
cultural objects. From every corner of Europe, trainfuls of paintings, 
sculptures, furniture, tapestries and silver rumbled into Germany. Then, with 
the German occupation of Italy, major museums, the Uffizzi first and foremost, 
were emptied out. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nicholas had stopped right here, she would have written a fascinating book; 
but because she goes on to describe the eventual rescue of these artistic 
treasures from the ruins of the Reich, she adds a strong element of 
spine-chilling suspense. Almost as soon as the Allied troops breached the 
borders of Germany, they began to find caches containing everything from great 
libraries to Michelangelo sculptures and, in one case, the entire German gold 
reserve. Masterpieces were hidden in mine shafts and country castles; some were 
properly packed, others just stacked, leaning against walls dripping with 
water; others, in the desperate days of collapse were simply taken by the local 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Never before had a problem on this scale existed. As it was, neither the 
Americans nor the British were at first prepared to deal with any of this. 
Happily, they soon caught on, and men like James Rorimer, the future director 
of the Metropolitan Museum, worked long and hard to ensure the safety -- amid 
total chaos -- of a major part of the European cultural legacy. More amazing 
still, considering the eagerness with which the Germans had tried to destroy 
whatever they could not steal, and the justly felt resentment of their former 
victims, the Western powers broke the age-old tradition. Aside from perhaps 
unavoidable individual thefts, there was no mass-scale looting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviets, however, took a different view: anything on which they could get 
their hands was sent back to Russia. Amazingly, they returned much of it in the 
'50s: from the Pergamon Altar in East Berlin to the Titians in Dresden, much of 
the loot came back to its place of origin. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many villains in "The Rape of Europa," and they include the greedy 
art dealers who made fortunes from the catastrophe. There are also many heroes. 
Although some of the looted works have disappeared, most, today, are back where 
they belong -- a miracle we owe, as Nicholas points out, "to the tiny number of 
'Monements men' of all nations who against overwhelming odds preserved (these 
masterpieces) for us." And in the end, her book, too, adds something to them: 
As we see all that was so nearly lost, these great works of art, so fragile, 
once so endangered, take on a special poignancy.

BLAST, WE FORGOT THE SISTERS KARAMAZOV; KINGSLEY AMIS CAN SKEWER THE MODERN 
WORLD LIKE NO OTHER WRITER; THE RUSSIAN GIRL, BY KINGSLEY AMIS (VIKING: $22.95; 
296 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Garry Abrams, Garry Abrams is at work on a novel about Los Angeles in the 
'90s. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sir Kingsley Amis' 21st novel opens ominously: The London Institute for 
Slavonic Studies is under assault on two fronts. Women faculty members are 
boycotting staff meetings to protest the Old Guard, Old Boy ways of the 
institute. Meanwhile, ineluctable and complex social and economic trends 
dictate that soon none of the school's students will be required to be fluent 
in -- or even vaguely familiar with -- Slavic languages. Better to have read 
"The Brothers Karamazov" in translation than never to have read it at all, as 
one character remarks, seeking to win over a hidebound traditionalist to the 
inevitable dumbing down of the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the recalcitrant stick-in-the-mud is Amis' hero, or what 
passes for one in the author's hilariously cruel universe. Having deftly 
assembled the forces of darkness, Amis promptly shoves Dr. Richard Vaisey down 
the gauntlet of fate. After not all that many pages, the 46-year-old Russian 
literature expert is receiving a brutal psychological caning because his sense 
of honor and his hormones are in conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaisey's midlife crisis stems from his multicultural adultery with Anna 
Danilova, a young Russian poet whose brother has been imprisoned for a vast 
financial fraud during the waning days of the Soviet state. Vaisey meets and 
falls for Anna when she comes to London to initiate a publicity drive to free 
her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Two problems soon snare Vaisey. First, the brother is guilty of the swindle 
and, therefore, hardly the advertised prisoner of conscience. Second, while 
Vaisey loves Anna, he almost instinctively loathes her poetry. Here is his 
reaction on first picking up a volume of Anna's work: "Richard sat and looked 
at the still-inviolate 'Reflections in a Russian Mirror,' feeling rather like a 
man with his head in a turned-on gas oven contemplating his first sniff." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite trying to find a shred of virtue in Anna's verse, Vaisey quickly 
concludes there is none and that the poems can only be described, albeit 
privately, in vile, usually scatological terms. 
</P>
<P>
 This is bad enough, but there's more -- lots and lots of it. The biggest slice 
of more is Vaisey's wife, Cordelia, a wealthy woman with the charm and subtlety 
of a starving grizzly. Sneaking around on Cordelia, Vaisey quickly discovers, 
is about as easy as dodging said bear while hobbled in gravity boots. Indeed, 
sympathetic readers may find themselves praying for Vaisey to suffer a massive 
coronary or develop a really fast fatal disease as a release from the fangs of 
Cordelia. 
</P>
<P>
 No such luck for Vaisey, of course. Indeed, much of the novel's momentum and 
humor springs from an assortment of Richard's friends interrogating him on why 
he made such a marriage and then endured it for a decade. When they aren't 
pondering this riddle, Vaisey and company are likely to be savoring Cordelia's 
worst faults. Is it her braying speech -- full of strangely placed consonants 
and accented like no language known on earth -- that she wields like a mace to 
bully her friends? Or is it her absolute selfishness, which ought to be 
measured in megatons? 
</P>
<P>
 Cordelia's greatest expertise, clearly, is revenge, for both major and minor 
perceived slights. For instance, Cordelia is famous for her vindictive book 
loans: "Cordelia struck back on Pat's departure by forcing on her a book about 
Athens (Ganymede Press, 1937), not perhaps much of a reverse in itself but 
carrying with it the penalty of being several times rung up to report how she 
was getting on with it, the first time at half-past eleven that night or at 
first light the next morning, and after a couple of days being urgently and 
repeatedly asked for it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Much less menacing is the exiled Russian writer Kotolynov, who declines to 
sign a petition for Anna's brother. Perhaps the most complicated of the book's 
characters, Kotolynov ultimately becomes a source of moral strength for Vaisey, 
whose rigid integrity regarding literary issues is his most prized 
characteristic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vaisey learns that his academic high horse isn't much help when it comes 
to coping with the onslaught of nitty-gritty chaos at home and at work. To 
compensate, he begins drinking more than usual, not that it helps much. His 
boozy wanderings may remind Amis fans of the drunken innkeeper of "The Green 
Man" or other of the novelist's hapless characters who spend a good deal of 
time throwing up or looking for a bathroom, urgently. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite a certain familiarity, Amis, the old master, somehow orchestrates 
all these themes, and several more, into a wonderful new concert of plot and 
language that provokes both belly laughs and twinges of discomfort over the 
silly messes we humans make while blundering through life. 
</P>
<P>
 That's pretty much what the lovers Vaisey and Anna do, blunder on to the end, 
Cordelia notwithstanding. To say more would give away too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics already have raved about this book in England. That may be the only 
correct response. "The Russian Girl" is brilliant satire, all the better 
because it is so plausible, so true to this confounded age of splintering 
splinter groups and lost souls who can find no place for their allegiance.

COVER STORY: A BRAND-NEW BALL GAME; WORLD-CLASS SOCCER IN THE U.S. IS A FIRST 
-- SO IS THE MASS MULTI-LANGUAGE COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a few weeks this summer, beginning Friday in Chicago's Soldier Field and 
ending July 17 in Pasadena's Rose Bowl, 24 nations representing the elite of 
international soccer will compete in the 15th World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports and TV sports coverage in the United States may never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the United States has played host to the Olympic Games and to 
major championships of all kinds, but it has never staged an event quite like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer played at the highest level is something American fans have yet to 
experience in person. But nine U.S. cities will discover very quickly this 
summer what passions soccer can arouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 52 matches will be played, culminating in the championship game at the 
Rose Bowl in front of a crowd of more than 91,000 and a global television 
audience that could well encompass half of humankind. Soccer is, after all, the 
world's most popular team sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants include the United States and defending champion Germany, as 
well as 22 other countries whose national teams survived up to two years of 
qualifying competition. A total of 141 nations started down that road; these 
are the elite 24 that completed the journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making Soccer History" is the slogan of the tournament and it could well come 
true. Already, virtually every one of the 3.5 million tickets have been sold; 
all 52 matches will be shown on television. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC Sports is broadcasting 11 of the games, including two of the U.S. 
first-round matches and the championship final. ESPN will televise the other 41 
games, including the other U.S. first-round match, both semifinals and the 
third-place game. ESPN2 also will carry some games. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-time Emmy winner Jim McKay will be the in-studio anchor for ABC's 
coverage, with Roger Twibell and Al Trautwig handling the play-by-play. Color 
commentary and analysis will be done by Rick Davis, a former U.S. national team 
captain, and Seamus Malin. ESPN will use a dozen commentators and analysts, 
including several U.S. soccer personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Univision, the Spanish-language network, will broadcast all 52 matches, most 
of them live. Andres Cantor and Norberto Longo will be the commentators. 
</P>
<P>
 All matches will be shown commercial-free. Commercials will be screened only 
during the pre-game, halftime and post-game segments, although there will be 
some small commercial graphics or logos superimposed on-screen during play. 
</P>
<P>
 An International Broadcast Center in Dallas will coordinate broadcasts for 180 
countries. The 1990 World Cup in Italy was watched by a cumulative audience of 
26.7 billion. This year, that figure is expected to surpass 31 billion. By 
contrast, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona attracted a total 16.6 billion 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany and Brazil, both three-time World Cup champions, again are favored to 
win. Italy, another triple winner, will be a serious contender, as will 
Argentina, which has won the tournament twice before. Other nations that very 
possibly could reach the Rose Bowl are The Netherlands and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 But surprise is part of the World Cup excitement and 1994 could well be the 
year of the upset. SOCCER TIPS FOR THE NOVICE VIEWER 
</P>
<P>
 If you've never watched a soccer game and wouldn't recognize a player if you 
tripped over him, here's an instant guide to help you understand and better 
enjoy what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing to remember is that soccer is a simple game. The 90-minute match is 
divided into 45-minute halves with no timeouts. There are 11 players on each 
team and every one of them, in theory, is free to wander anywhere on the field 
he wants to. Each team is limited to three substitutions. Once a player is 
taken off, he cannot return. Use of hands is forbidden, except by the 
goalkeepers inside their own areas. The referee is in sole charge of the game. 
The winner is the team that puts the ball in the net most often. 
</P>
<P>
 There, wasn't that simple? 
</P>
<P>
 Here, now, is a little more detailed explanation of the four basic player 
positions and their role, along with some of the stars to watch for during the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 GOALKEEPERS 
</P>
<P>
 They are the last line of defense, the acrobats of soccer who fling themselves 
about at risk, if not to life, then certainly to limb. They wear gloves and a 
different-colored jersey to distinguish them from the rest of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 STARS TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 -- Argentina's Sergio Goycochea 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ireland's Pat Bonner 
</P>
<P>
 -- United States' Tony Meola 
</P>
<P>
 -- Italy's Gianluca Pagliuca 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mexico's Jorge Campos 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spain's Adoni Zubizaretta 
</P>
<P>
 -- Germany's Bodo Illgner 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sweden's Thomas Ravelli 
</P>
<P>
 DEFENDERS 
</P>
<P>
 There are generally at least four of them and they tend to stay back and 
protect their goal area. Their responsibility is to thwart the opposing 
attackers by tackling, blocking shots and so on. They are usually physically 
larger and more aggressive than the other players. 
</P>
<P>
 STARS TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 -- Italy's Franco Baresi 
</P>
<P>
 -- Germany's Lothar Matthaus 
</P>
<P>
 -- Argentina's Oscar Ruggeri 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mexico's Ramon Ramirez 
</P>
<P>
 -- Norway's Rune Bratseth 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brazil's Jorginho 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ireland's Paul McGrath 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Netherlands' Ronald Koeman 
</P>
<P>
 MIDFIELDERS 
</P>
<P>
 There can be anywhere from two to five of these players, all of them acting as 
linkmen between the defense and offense. Some are primarily defensive; others 
are little more than disguised forwards. The creative midfielders are the 
so-called "brains" of the team, responsible for setting up plays and 
controlling the action. They function like the hub of a wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 STARS TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 -- Colombia's Carlos Valderrama 
</P>
<P>
 -- Argentina's Diego Maradona 
</P>
<P>
 -- Germany's Andreas Moller 
</P>
<P>
 -- United States' Tab Ramos 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Netherlands' Frank Rijkaard 
</P>
<P>
 -- Belgium's Enzo Scifo 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bolivia's Erwin (Platini) Sanchez 
</P>
<P>
 -- Romania's Gheorghe Hagi 
</P>
<P>
 FORWARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Also known as strikers. There can be one, two or three of them. Their duty is 
to finish what the midfielders create. They must put the ball in the net. 
Nothing else matters. Usually, they are the fastest players on the field, the 
most dangerous and the highest paid. 
</P>
<P>
 STARS TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 -- Italy's Roberto Baggio 
</P>
<P>
 -- Germany's Jurgen Klinsmann 
</P>
<P>
 -- Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Netherlands' Dennis Bergkamp 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brazil's Romario and Bebeto 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov 
</P>
<P>
 -- Colombia's Faustino Asprilla 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nigeria's Rachidi Yekini

AMERICA'S CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, under Serbian-born coach Bora Milutinovic, has assembled 
what is unquestionably its finest and most experienced World Cup team ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge facing the American players, however, is a daunting one. The 
United States must play Switzerland, Colombia and Romania in the first round, 
and each of them are powerful opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 No World Cup host nation has ever failed to advance to at least the second 
round, and the Americans are determined not to become the first. In their favor 
is Milutinovic's reputation as a "miracle worker." In 1986, he coached lightly 
regarded Mexico all the way to the quarterfinals and, four years ago in Italy, 
he coached tiny Costa Rica into the second round at the expense of such powers 
as Scotland and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team lost all three of its games in the 1990 tournament in Italy -- 
its first World Cup appearance in 40 years -- but since then many of America's 
best players have gained invaluable experience playing professionally in 
Europe. Others, meanwhile, have undergone a rigorous, three-year period of 
preparation under Milutinovic's guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the American players likely to catch the eye during the tournament are 
goalkeeper Tony Meola, winger Cobi Jones, midfielders Tab Ramos and Cladio 
Reyna, and defenders Alexi Lalas and Thomas Dooley. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States opens play Saturday against Switzerland at the Pontiac 
Silverdome -- the first World Cup match ever to be played indoors. It then 
plays Colombia and Romania at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Defender Marcelo Balboa, a veteran of the last World Cup, believes the U.S. 
squad is better prepared than ever before. 
</P>

 "I think in 1990 we were scared," he said. "We were going into a tournament 
where we had no clue what was going on. This year, the attitude is, 'Hey, we 
can beat anybody.' We're not scared of anybody. I think the attitude is great. 
Now, we've just got to go out and do it."

 The fact that the World Cup is being played in the United States has added to 
the U.S. players' confidence. They believe they will have a significant home 
field advantage.

HOW OUR GUYS WON THE COLD WAR; VICTORY: THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S SECRET 
STRATEGY THAT HASTENED THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION, BY PETER SCHWEIZER 
(GROVE/ATLANTIC: $22; 284 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Kwitny, Jonathan Kwitny's latest book is Acceptable Risks (Simon 
and Schuster). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For this book, author Peter Schweizer has received unique access to some top 
Reagan Administration foreign policy officials (Caspar Weinberger, George 
Shultz, Bill Clark, Robert McFarlane, John Poindexter, Richard Allen) plus, 
even more impressively, some high-level Central Intelligence Agency operatives 
(Alan Fiers, Herb Meyer, Vincent Cannistraro, Dewey Clarridge) and a few other 
former high-level power-wielders. Most of these guys don't open up easily for 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that the 1980s saw the most dramatic shift in international 
politics of our lifetime, maybe of any decade in history, Schweizer had a 
unique opportunity to produce a journalistic and historical landmark. Sadly, 
this book is neither journalism nor history. Its many valuable revelations and 
insights have been spun into a polemic so unchecked and, for the reader, often 
un-checkable, that we can't tell the fact from the fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The book yields no indication that Schweizer accepted his new data as leads 
and went back to where the action happened -- Afghanistan, Poland, Saudi 
Arabia, Central Russia and elsewhere -- to talk to the people involved. Such 
reporting might have humbled, at least a bit, his thesis. He says a handful of 
people in Washington by their mere resolve and willingness to work long hours 
and spend tax money unflinchingly were able to turn Communist success into the 
destruction of Communism around the world. He knows this because they told him. 
</P>
<P>
 President Reagan did change policy and help change history. The size of the 
accomplishment is all the more reason this story should have been accorded the 
respect of good research. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Schweizer quotes from previously undisclosed diaries and documents, he 
contributes a useful sense of the chronology of Reagan's thought processes. But 
he doesn't connect this to results through any real reporting. Instead, 
Schweizer's book settles for stories, mostly not attributed, about former CIA 
director William Casey's dropping out of the sky here and there in his private 
jet and working quickie miracles. Casey, a fly-by-night operator in both the 
literal and figurative senses in this book, drops in on a Pakistani general for 
two days every couple of years, barks at startled underlings that the weapons 
previously supplied were "pure crap. . . . The General knows what he wants, get 
it for him," and thereby wins the Afghan war. I spent a month with the Afghan 
underground in Afghanistan, not Pakistan) before Reagan was even elected, and 
these accounts shortchange the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, as important as the Afghan war was in bringing down Soviet tyranny, 
it's worth considering also how little the Afgh ans have enjoyed of the freedom 
they died for. 
</P>
<P>
 There is evidence available that Americans, based on their single-minded zeal 
to kill Russians, made policy decisions that unnecessarily enthroned local 
tyrants and continued a fratricidal carnage with American arms long after the 
Soviets had slunk away. But Schweizer's sources don't want to talk about that, 
and so he doesn't talk about it either. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweizer writes page after unattributed page purporting to lay bare Casey's 
thoughts and emotions seven years after his death. But he scarcely mentions 
Central America, which was Casey's main passion according to his biographer, 
Joseph Persico, and purported confidante, Bob Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweizer seems to think that since the Contra war didn't work out as planned, 
he needn't bring it up now. Nor does he bother mentioning Casey's pal and 
protege Oliver North. Sic transit gloria mundi. On the other hand, Poland, 
which was a side issue in previous books about Casey, but which turned out to 
provide the big victory the Administration sought, is made by Schweizer to seem 
a No. 1 all along. One can't avoid the suspicion this is Soviet-style history 
-- rewritten to suit the current propaganda need. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Schweizer's source list includes some honorable men, some others have 
clearly used him to skewer their enemies and embellish their own spots in 
history. He includes occasional footnotes, but mostly doesn't say who told him 
what. And he evidently doesn't believe in picking up a phone to check their 
various assertions. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweizer quotes a Soviet secret police (KGB) letter suggesting that Senator 
Edward Kennedy was undercutting President Reagan's arms negotiations with his 
own secret gambits to the Russians through former Democratic Senator John 
Tunney, whom Schweizer also names. Schweizer doesn't mention that Kennedy and 
Tunney angrily deny this -- or that Reagan's own disarmament negotiator, Max M. 
Kampelman, wrote a memoir lauding Kennedy for serving, at the Administration's 
request, as a confidential "back channel" to the Soviets, who wanted to talk to 
him because of his celebrity. Contrary to Schweizer's charge, President Reagan 
personally approved. 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland about Schweizer's descriptions of 
his work (generally, Schweizer portrays Kirkland, the CIA and the Vatican as 
plotters together), Kirkland's denial was so vigorous as to be unprintable in a 
family newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope himself is depicted vaguely as some sort of covert operations 
conspirator, with no verifiable documentation, no recognition of his spiritual 
dimension, and no denial, which would surely be forthcoming from the Vatican 
press office if Schweizer bothered to ask. Schweizer even asserts that the Pope 
thought the Soviet Union was responsible for the attempt on his life, 
suggesting that's what led the Vatican to cooperate with Casey. Whoever told 
this to Schweizer (he doesn't say), I'll bet it wasn't the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweizer reports that former Pakistani strongman Zia ul-Haq was killed in a 
midair plane explosion linked by circumstantial evidence to the KGB; he 
footnotes that statement, citing an interview with Mohammad Yousaf, a Pakistani 
intelligence officer who is heavily relied on throughout this book. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, investigations I'm aware of into the Zia crash didn't show any 
evidence of a midair explosion or the KGB, but showed considerable evidence 
that Zia's plane crashed because of cockpit sabotage most likely arranged by 
Pakistani rivals. The U.S. government never pressed the case in public even 
though the American ambassador died in the crash with Zia, probably because the 
guilt of Pakistani officers would have been politically embarrassing. If 
Schweizer's source is biased and wrong about this, what about the other 
material from the same source, attributed and not attributed -- maybe stuff 
about Casey? 
</P>
<P>
 Schweizer is such a sieve for fiction mixed with fact that he even includes a 
reference to "Captain Quigg and his steel balls in 'Mutiny on the Bounty.' " 
(Captain Quigg, a fictional character in Herman Wouk's novel "The Caine 
Mutiny," rolled steel balls in his hand as a nervous sign of his insanity two 
centuries after the real-life Bounty mutiny.) 
</P>
<P>
 Given all that, what are we to think when Schweizer reports daring, successful 
covert operations overseas, based not on Schweizer's personal inspection or 
even on sworn testimony but on the word of "one official involved in the 
program?" ("Sure, Mr. Schweizer, let me tell you how my secret team really won 
the Cold War. Of course, it has to be off-the-record, but. . . .") 
</P>
<P>
 Did Reagan and Casey, as Schweizer says, without telling Congress, take the 
risk of arming and training Afghan teams that they sent on sabotage raids deep 
inside the Soviet Union? Apparently so, though it's hard to gauge the extent of 
it without clearer sources; even Schweizer says the program was delayed, then 
scaled down, because of cold feet. It was, of course, an act of war against a 
nuclear superpower. But, then, Schweizer says American bombers persistently 
flew almost into Soviet territory, then turned back at the last second, to 
psychologically destabilize Soviet commanders. (Did I, at home in New Jersey 
with two little girls, really want the USSR's nuclear triggermen to be 
psychologically destabilized?) 
</P>
<P>
 Did Casey secretly agree to pay bills for Israeli intelligence and supply 
satellite photos of the Iraqi nuclear facility Israel eventually bombed, in 
exchange for access to Israeli-developed spies in Poland? Schweizer says so, 
but, as happens more than once in this book, the agreement consists of a 
detailed proposal made by an American, responded to with a reported nod -- no 
quotable words -- by a foreign national, and no confirmation. (The Vatican is 
said to have entered such a plot when the Pope "subtly nodded.") 
</P>
<P>
 Did Casey also, with Reagan's approval, make a similar wink-and-nod deal to 
guarantee a U.S. troop invasion if needed to protect the Saudi monarchy, even 
against its own subjects, in exchange for a Saudi promise to hold down oil 
prices so the Soviet Union would earn less from its oil exports? 
</P>
<P>
 Did Casey double-cross our NATO ally Greece by secretly offering satellite 
coverage of Cyprus to Turkey in exchange for Turkish help sabotaging the USSR? 
(The only footnote for this assertion leads to an anonymous "U.S. intelligence 
official.") 
</P>
<P>
 And did Casey promise racist South Africa he would "help you in Washington and 
with intelligence," in possible violation of international sanctions, in return 
for South Africa's pledge to restrain gold prices to hurt "the gold-rich 
Soviets?" Schweizer says so, but his only apparent source, Casey, was a corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev murdered by agents of his successor, Yuri 
Andropov? That's how Schweizer writers it, with a footnote to a vaguely 
identified publication and "one former KGB official." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Al Haig get fired as secretary of state because he sided with our Western 
European Allies who favored a natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union that 
Reagan wanted stopped? Schweizer says so, on the word of "a senior NSC 
(National Security Council) staff member." Reagan opposed the pipeline because, 
Schweizer says, Casey and Weinberger gave him economic analyses showing how 
desperately the Soviets needed the money from the gas sales. Schweizer pictures 
Casey and Weinberger as go-get-'em policy twins who were constantly opposed by 
naysayers Haig and George Bush. On the other hand, Persico in his biography, 
and Shultz in his memoir, say Casey was Haig's best friend in the 
administration; they suggest Haig resigned over personality clashes with 
Reagan's less-worldly California staff. My gut assessment of the personalities 
tells me Schweizer is probably right on this one. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the point. The point is that to judge what is right in these 
weighty and controversial matters, a reader needs from an author a candid 
accounting of the various possibilities. Readers are not well served by the 
unsupported boasts of former officials who would like to take credit for a 
famous victory, and certainly not by the unsubstantiated purported thoughts of 
long-dead CIA directors. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if Schweizer was much of a digger, maybe he wouldn't have 
been given all these interviews and documents in the first place.

ANXIETY AND THE MILLENNIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading Ronald Brownstein's "The New Age of Anxiety" and Michael 
Ventura's "The 21st Century Is Now" (May 8), I had to write this letter. I'm a 
23-year-old African American woman who graduated from Stanford, luckily has a 
job and has benefited from the courageous, collective struggles of my 
predecessors. I'm middle class, went to the best schools, went to summer camp 
and swam in the same pool with my Irish, Jewish and Asian friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people ask me why I've been so worried when I have so much, why I'm so 
glum and can't pull myself together. I have no excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 However, these insightful and profound articles led me to reasons why I feel 
so unglued at times. Take malls, for example: They've always made me feel edgy, 
even irritable. In and out. Buy and sell. Park and leave. I really hate malls. 
And worse than that, the thought of shopping from my home computer makes me 
nauseated. 
</P>
<P>
 We have managed to sacrifice community for convenience. It has become much 
harder to speak our minds, to confront each other's limitations face to face. 
</P>
<P>
 These articles were a revelation. I feel a new sense of strength. I'm strong 
enough to feel in this push-push-to-make-it-to-the-top world. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm leaving my job to pursue teaching for a year in Nigeria, where there 
are no malls and no fax. I'll return to America in 1995. Starting now I will 
make "millions of small decisions that create our world" and "exert my enormous 
powers." I will use my super-duper computer to write kind letters to my friends 
around the world -- even to strangers like Brownstein and Ventura, who don't 
seem very strange after all. 
</P>

 After reading Brownstein's brilliant essay on the shape of what is and what 
isn't in the world we live in, I'd say that an era of uncertainty as pervasive 
as the one surrounding us all demands a very large portion of both patience and 
prudence combined with some bold vision. 
</P>
<P>
 We need more determined diplomacy, more look-before-you-leap congressional and 
military judgment and a return to media of studied intelligence and reason. 
Perhaps down that path we may find the highest common denominator, one to lead 
us together to restore a more livable community of tolerance and trust in 
ourselves in a brave new world. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 One thing Brownstein virtually skipped was our involvement in the Vietnam War, 
which by itself shaped our troubled present. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm reminded of what Robert N. Bellah, Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, 
Ann Swidler and Steven M. Tipton in "The Good Society" wrote about the "Me 
Generation" of the '80s: "They (the people interviewed) realize that, though 
the processes of separation and individuation were necessary to free us from 
the tyrannical structures of the past, they must be balanced by a renewal of 
commitment and community if they are not to end in self-destruction or turn 
into their opposites. Such a renewal is indeed a world waiting to be born if 
only we had the courage to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 ANDREW KAY LIBERMAN 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Brownstein's article has relieved my anxiety by putting the uncertainty I feel 
about our world's future in its place -- as a necessary and recurring theme in 
history. It's also reassuring that President Clinton seems to have a grip on 
"the vision thing." Your article was better than Xanax. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 So: "From 1947 to 1973, the median family income doubled." And: "Over the past 
20 years, the median family income has been virtually stagnant." 
</P>
<P>
 And this: "Congress virtually sealed off immigration . . . from 1930 to 1970 . 
. . ." And: "Congress revised the immigration laws in 1965, opening the gates 
for a second wave of migrants . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, allowing for a time lag while policies take hold, there seems 
to be a correlation between the economic prosperity and stability of this 
country when immigration is low and the reverse when immigration numbers are 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 R. PRUCHNICKI 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Brownstein says that uncertainty is the price of renewal, but a more 
appropriate and realistic statement would be: Ever-increasing and 
ever-more-vicious crime is the price of uncertainty and hopelessness. We will 
continue to pay dearly with crime and chaos until we start giving the 
sociologists equal time with the economists, who seemingly care not a whit 
about the imminent breakdown of America's middle class and, coincidentally, 
America as we have known it. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Ventura says in "The 21st Century Is Now" that he's watching lots of 
television, getting older and becoming confused. Here he comes, the hood 
ornament of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 His essay asserts that civilization "is about what normal struggling people 
do" and not about "newsmakers who number only a tiny percentage" of us. Good! 
So Ross Perot wields no more clout than a street person. If Alan Greenspan 
announces higher interest rates, I'll announce lower ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura blames each of us for trying to spend less, thereby eliminating our 
own jobs, for being choosy shoppers in a wonderfully self-correcting free 
market. There we were, silly middle-class savers whose incomes slipped down a 
shallow, two-decade-long slope. We should have splurged while patriotic 
businesses gave our jobs to desperate neighbors across the border at exiguous 
wages, yielding greater profits than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly understand why Ventura wakes up in his "small apartment . . . 
confused about what's next." 
</P>
<P>
 EDDIE VELA

<P>

</P>
<P>
 As a student of "classical civilization," I've come to terms with the 
realization that we are repeat offenders throughout the course of human 
history. This time, however, we have speeded things up drastically. We have 
experienced many victories and disappointments, a classical period and a 
renaissance, all crammed into the 20th Century. Currently, we are experiencing 
nostalgia as proof of decades of transitions. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that the dysfunctional community, family and school are a result of 
our conventionalization and untutored decision making, which have removed the 
function of the individual. We should have already learned that what affects 
the individual affects the tribe, the community and, subsequently, the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The arts tell us a great deal about ourselves, past and present. We need to 
look to the arts to find our way, and that is why I agree that the power to 
change the future is in the hands of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 We are truly at the end of an era; all the signs are there. But it's an end we 
probably have created for ourselves. If we study history well and trust in 
humanity, although the end is near, the beginning will always be around there, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 PATRICK RODELA 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I agree wholeheartedly with Ventura's premise, but I have to challenge his 
contention that the 21st Century begins with the year 2000. It begins in 2001. 
For example, the first century was AD 1 to 100 (there was no year zero), the 
second century 101 to 200 and so forth. The millennium ends with the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES LEE

</P>
<P>
 Somehow, we Angelenos have overemphasized the private domain at the expense of 
the public one. We've been promised more luxury options inside our locked car 
doors, inside our electronic gates and inside our office buildings with windows 
that in many cases do not open to the outside world. But the price of 
self-involved luxury is loneliness, alienation and, ultimately and frequently, 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution to the disintegration of community may be in our facing up to the 
real price we pay for hiding in our private shells. Is isolation the inevitable 
byproduct of progress? Isn't community interaction worth progressing toward, 
too? If so, perhaps we can use our existing tools and new technologies to 
re-emphasize our public spaces, be they Italian markets or farmers' markets. 
Perhaps we can re-emphasize the role of interest groups, be they writing groups 
or ethnic-pride groups. Perhaps we need to re-emphasize the importance of 
feeling good, rather than just looking good at our social and athletic clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps we can start rebuilding the smaller communities that provide the 
texture for the city in which we've all chosen to live. That, in turn, would 
revitalize our larger, common community and our sense of interconnectedness.

 ONE HUNDRED SAINTS: Their Lives and Likenesses Drawn From Butler's "Lives of 
the Saints" and Great Works of Eastern Art (Bulfinch Press/Little Brown & Co.: 
$35; 279 pp.). Who should you pray to if God is busy? Well, if you have a 
toothache, you might appeal to St. Apollonia, Virgin and Martyr. Zurbarian's 
portrait makes her look competent, if not sympathetic. And she is holding an 
unappealing tool. Or if you're in public relations for hospitals, you might 
appeal to St. Paul, Apostle of the Gentiles. El Greco's St. James the Less, 
Patron Saint of Druggists and Hatters, like most of the portraits in "One 
Hundred Saints," tells us much more about the man than the text. He is 
careworn, pragmatic, but stylish. Caravaggio, Rubens, Tintoretto, Titian, 
Murillo and Botticelli, to name a few of the artists represented here, are 
richly reproduced, with plenty of space, and in most cases they put the 
somewhat humorless and often convoluted text to shame. The excerpts from Butler 
don't really answer our most fundamental questions, like how on earth St. Clare 
became the Patron Saint of Television or why St. Anne is the Patron Saint of 
Canada, Cabinetmakers and Women in Labor. It's all very mysterious. But here is 
St. Lucy, Patron Saint of Sufferers of Eye Trouble and Writers, in a portrait 
by Pietro Perugino, in case you think you need her. SUSAN REYNOLDS

 Trying to protect his student's innocence

 he told them the Ice Age was really just

<P>
 the Chilly Age, a period of a million years 
</P>
<P>
 when everyone had to wear sweaters.

<P>
 And the Stone Age became the Gravel Age,

 named after the long driveways of the time.

 The Spanish Inquisition was nothing more

 "How far is it from here to Madrid?"

 "What do you call the matador's hat?"

THE ROYAL CHARLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prince Charles' ability to comment on plants and environmental issues is his 
only redeeming quality ("Building a Better Prince," by William Tuohy, May 8). 
Rather than giving him an aura of looniness, these topics lend him an air of 
intelligence.However, the fact that he still goes on fox hunts, even though his 
parents are involved in the RSPCA and the World Wildlife Fund, argues for his 
eccentricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' participation in blood sports and comments about tampons should be 
more than enough to keep him off the throne. How anyone could bow and scrape to 
this individual is beyond comprehension.

 In as precarious a position as the monarchy finds itself today, it might be 
worth considering a solution offered by A. N. Wilson in his book "The Rise and 
Fall of the House of Windsor." He suggests as an ideal successor Richard, Duke 
of Gloucester, a grandchild of George V (as Elizabeth herself is). Richard has 
a lovely wife, three fine children and no hint of scandal in his quiet and, 
frankly, not-too-interesting life. Also, he is descended on his mother's side 
from Charles II.

 Now that I've read the great job Tuohy did of trashing Prince Charles, I 
suggest that Tuohy return to the United States, where he could lend his 
considerable talents to the job of crucifying Bill Clinton.

 THE SIXTEEN PLEASURES by Robert Hellenga (Soho Press: $22; 332 pp.) They used 
to say that novels were unseemly and even dangerous, particularly for female 
readers, who might get ideas about sex and romance and try to apply them to 
their domestic situations.This novel has several potentially dangerous 
ingredients. Margot, a serious restorer of antique books, ups and goes to 
Florence after the flooding of the Arno, ostensibly to help out but really to 
put a jagged turn in her life. Italy, unattached woman, books: the big danger 
signs. While helping to restore a local convent's library, Margot is entrusted 
with a volume called "The Sixteen Pleasures," a book of erotic drawings by 
Giulio Romano with accompanying Sonetti lussuriosi by Aretino. The convent's 
abbess asks her to take it away to avoid scandal. Margot restores the volume 
and in the process meets a man, a restorer of frescoes, whom she trusts, even 
though everyone who knows him says she shouldn't. It must be said that Margot 
in love has a very strange, detached equanimity, which strikes me as more male 
than female, and which one sees now and then in female characters drawn by men. 
But the most wonderful thing about this novel is how contained it is, an 
adventure under pressure. Its central metaphor is that life is more like a 
piazza than a road: "A piazza is a microcosm," the author tells us on the last 
page, "not a way of getting from one place to another."

 TWO STORIES OF PRAGUE by Rainer Maria Rilke, translated by Angela Esterhammer 
(University Press of New England: $18.95; 109 pp.) These two stories, "King 
Bohush" and "The Siblings," were first published in 1899, when Rilke was 24. At 
the time, he was living in Munich, looking back on Prague and his childhood 
there, although he had only been away from that city for a year and a half. 
"The aim of the book," he wrote much later, "was to come closer to my own 
childhood." In the end of the 19th Century Prague had a population of about 
350,000; one-tenth German and the rest Czech. Roughly one-half of the German 
population was Jewish; the Czechs, for the most part, Catholic. That is a very 
terse way of putting what later became an enormous collection of tensions that 
are still alive and well. These stories have never before been published in 
English, and they are keenly translated by Angela Esterhammer, who has also 
written an indispensable introduction that gives the political background 
needed to understand them. Rilke never wanted his early work published, and it 
is easy to see why he might feel self-conscious about these stories. While they 
poke fun at the Prague German culture, the coffee-house literati, the town in 
which "everyone bedecks himself with his joy and carries his sorrow with him 
too, as visibly as possible," they are two-thirds sermon and one-third memoir, 
with very little to hang onto in the way of characters or story or even 
moral.While it's fine for the poet to try to capture the essence of his native 
city, it's just a little self-serving, as an author might be in his early 20s. 
Rilke is clearly indifferent to whether the reader follows the careful layering 
of cynicism and irony and self deprecation peculiar to this culture. He cannot 
help, however, but evoke a city of dreams, which every lover of Prague will 
recognize in all its contradictions.

 A POETRY HANDBOOK by Mary Oliver (Harcourt Brace & Co . : $8.95; 101 pp.) Most 
of us have a natural aversion to books that presume to tell us how to write 
poetry. This is not one of those books. Mary Oliver would probably never admit 
to anything so grandiose as an effort to connect the conscious mind and the 
heart (that's what she says poetry can do), but that is exactly what she 
accomplishes in this stunning little handbook, ostensibly written "to empower 
the beginning writer who stands between two marvelous and complex things -- an 
experience (or an idea of a feeling), and the urge to tell about it in the best 
possible conjunction of words." From here on in it's all straightforward work: 
Oliver gives us tools "for the listening mind," tools we need to write poetry, 
excavating them from centuries of embellishment and obfuscation. First, there 
is Sound, that link between experience and expression that has somehow come 
unhinged. Without it, there's hardly any pleasure in poetry. Oliver reminds us 
that there are not just vowels, but mutes ( b , d , k , p , t , q ) and 
aspirates ( c , f , g , h , j , s , x ) and liquids ( l , m , n , r )! Then 
there is the Line: Why do we turn it when we do (a question often asked of 
poets, particularly writers of free verse)? Originally, Oliver reminds, the 
length of the line was linked to the regular English breath, for which the 
iambic pentameter is best suited.But there are other patterns which, by their 
very sound, convey anger or tension or melancholy, like notes and phrases in 
music: the dactyl, the anapest, the trochee, the caesura, all tools to reunite 
sound and meaning. And there are others: Imagery, Tone (much more intimate, 
writes Oliver, in contemporary poetry) and Diction. Perhaps my favorite, 
however, are the brief sections on "Revision," and "Workshops and Solitude," 
for it is here that Oliver gives some unobtrusive hints for caring for that 
part of the person that writes poetry: "Athletes take care of their bodies. 
Writers must simply take care of the sensibility that houses the possibility of 
poems." "Rise early," and "live simply and honorably," Oliver suggests. "Think 
of yourself," she writes, "as one member of a single, recognizable tribe."

 TRAVELING IN ITALY WITH HENRY JAMES edited by Fred Kaplan (William Morrow: 
$27.50; 413 pp.) Henry James, sower of wanderlust, patron saint of bons vivants 
, is collected here in a tincture of Italy, his voluminous travel essays boiled 
down to a manageable book of letters and essays from his travels there between 
1869 and 1907.This allows the reader to compare James' first impressions with 
those supposedly more somber later reflections on Venice, Rome, Florence, the 
Bay of Naples, Siena, Ravenna, etc. And I am happy to report that, if anything, 
James gets progressively less somber, goes off the impressionistic deep end -- 
his observations less detailed, less place-specific, less helpful to the 
practical traveler and more helpful to the armchair traveler. Exploring in the 
shadow of Ruskin, James is determined to tell us something new about Italy and 
repeatedly despairs with the phrase: "Everything has been said." But his sheer 
enthusiasm, in "hours of expansion and those of contraction," for the "bosky 
byways," "adorable strangeness" and "unanalysable loveableness of Italy" sets 
him apart from Ruskin, even as he apologizes for that enthusiasm profusely. On 
Venice: "It is a city in which, I suspect, there is very little strenuous 
thinking," and later: "These steps are cool in the morning, yet I don't know 
that I can justify my excessive fondness for them any better than I can explain 
a hundred of the other vague infatuations with which Venice sophisticates the 
spirit." Florence, in his first impressions, is "the sanest of cities," with a 
"temperate joy" that in later years becomes a "grave brilliance." In Rome he 
writes to Alice James: "The excitement of the first hour has passed away & I 
have recovered the healthy mental equilibrium of the sober practical tourist." 
Never! Not for Henry James in Italy!

 DAUGHTERS: On Family and Fatherhood by Gerald Early (Addison-Wesley: $17; 256 
pp.) This book is not about race, Gerald Early protests loudly and often. Page 
145, definition of blackness: "Blackness is not an Afrocentric lesson, nor a 
coming together of the tribe in a fake unity. It is this: a fatalistic, 
realistic belief in human transcendence, born in the consciousness of a people 
who experienced the gut-wrenching harshness of slavery." It's not about race, 
he says as he describes his feelings about his daughter's potentially dating 
white boys. It's not about race, he says as he describes the importance of the 
civil rights movement to his kids. It's not about race, he wants to say when 
the policemen stop him for taking a walk outside the building in which his wife 
Ida is attending a Junior League meeting in their university town. "I'm tired," 
says his youngest daughter Rosalind at this point, "of hearing about race." In 
fairness, this book is not all about race. Much of it is about how Early came 
to terms with his eldest daughter's early learning disabilities and "how the 
members of a family come to believe in each other." At one point Linnet, the 
eldest, makes fun of her father: "Another wonderful tale," she describes one of 
the fables of Early's childhood (which always involve books and hard work), 
"about growing up black and living in the city." "I think shame often winds up 
being expressed in people as odd forms of strength or excessive pride," Early 
writes.The idea that this gentle, thoughtful man has been made to feel less 
than he is in itself constitutes an indictment of racism. We are given the 
unique privilege, here, of watching him come to terms with both race and 
family. If Gerald Early, try as he might, can't escape race, his daughters can 
and will, even as they watch their father struggle with it.

 SEEING VIETNAM: Encounters on the Road and Heart by Susan Brownmiller 
(HarperCollins: $22; 228 pp.) What was Susan Brownmiller thinking about when 
she wrote this strange travelogue about Vietnam? It has the feel of a posh 
travel assignment run amok (in fact, Travel & Leisure sent Brownmiller to 
Vietnam in 1992).What's the fanciest hotel in Hanoi? How do you teach your 
translator the English phrase "I am hot to trot"? Shopping, shopping, shopping, 
lamely justified as one way to understand the economy growing in Vietnam. 
"Slowly it dawned on us," she writes, "that most of the Asian faces we were 
seeing in Hanoi's upscale restaurants weren't Vietnamese." I believe she has 
spent decades thinking about Vietnam and what it means to be an American there, 
but why didn't she write that book instead of this shopper's guide to a broken 
country? At one point, some women in a park in Hanoi gather around Brownmiller 
asking, through a translator, how she likes Hanoi. "Tell them I like Hanoi very 
much. Hanoi is a beautiful city, with beautiful parks. Tell them. . . . Oh 
Jesus, God. Tell them I'm very sorry for what my country did to your country. 
And I burst into tears." It must be said that, moving as this point may be, the 
rest of the book is so trite, so strained between travelogue and political 
conscience, that a reader cannot sympathize.

 The World Cup is far more than just a soccer tournament. It is a celebration 
of the sport and its universal appeal.The impact was well-described recently by 
Eric Wynalda, a forward on the United States team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Cinco de Mayo, Mardi Gras and (Rio de Janeiro's) Carnival all in one," 
Wynalda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, so exuberant and colorful are the fans that they are as much a part of 
the event as the soccer itself. They sing and dance inside the stadiums and 
out. They paint their bodies in the colors of their favorite team. They wear 
outlandish clothing. Win or lose, they party far into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets of the nine World Cup cities will be filled with unimaginable 
scenes. Anything goes in the World Cup. The emphasis is on having a good time.

ON VIEW; KEATON IN THE COCKPIT; THE LIFE AND DREAM OF AMELIA EARHART ON TNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With her hair cropped short and attired in a gray business suit, Diane Keaton 
is a far sight from Annie Hall as she stands on stage at the Wilshire Ebell 
Theatre in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Keaton's dramatic new look is for her dramatic new role as famed aviator 
Amelia Earhart in "Amelia Earhart: Her Final Flight," premiering Sunday on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
 This brisk morning, the Oscar-winning actress is shooting a scene in which 
Earhart gives a speech at Purdue University in hopes of obtaining additional 
financing for her flight around the world. Sharing the stage and scene with 
Keaton is Bruce Dern, who plays Earhart's controversial husband, manager and 
press agent, publisher George Palmer Putnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her Final Flight" dramatizes Earhart's luckless last voyage in which the 
famed "Lady Lindy" and her hard-drinking navigator Fred Noonan (Rutger Hauer) 
attempted to circumnavigate the globe along the Equator in a state-of-the-art 
Lockheed Electra. After departing New Guinea on July 2, 1937, though, Earhart 
and Noonan slipped out of radio contact and never reached their destination, a 
small atoll in the South Pacific called Howland Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an exhaustive search then and in expeditions throughout the years, 
Earhart, Noonan and the plane were never found. Her disappearance is still one 
of the great mysteries of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing the scene at the Wilshire Ebell, Keaton offers a strong 
handshake and a smile to the set's visitor. With the hectic shooting schedule, 
Keaton begs off doing interviews until months after the filming is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dern, father of actress Laura, is more than willing to discuss the project 
during a break. The actor says he perceives "Her Final Flight" primarily to be 
a beautiful love story. He recalls that when he first read Anna Sandor's 
script, "I had to put it down four times because I simply couldn't go on for a 
minute because you know what happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Putnam) loved her desperately, and as they grew in those eight years of 
marriage, I think she grew to love him." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Dern is concerned, Putnam was the "first man behind the woman. He 
was a guy who was willing to give up an active part of his life and business in 
which he was a star to let his wife achieve her dreams. The fact he realized 
that it was important for her to do it, and do it in that day and age, was 
remarkable. He saw the light and backed off and said, 'It's your stage. I want 
to do something for you.' I find that enormously touching." 
</P>
<P>
 Keaton, though, doesn't quite share Dern's views. "That's where she is an 
interesting character," she explains over the phone later. "Everybody disagrees 
(about the marriage). They agree to disagree. I believe any time you make a 
commitment to a person for that long a time and that intense a situation, 
everything is attached to it. I think there was a love. It isn't a perfect 
thing, but I think that's a big commitment. I don't think you can write it 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Keaton's producing partner, Joe Kelly, who brought the idea of doing a 
movie on Earhart to TNT. And Keaton relished the opportunity to play the woman 
who won the hearts of the world in the '30s and became the most famous female 
flyer in history. To prepare, Keaton watched newsreel footage of Earhart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would spend a half-hour every day with Amelia. I fell even more in love 
with her because she was such a little puzzle. She was such a little mysterious 
girl to me and beautiful and very compelling. On the one hand, she was 
extremely willful and, on the other hand, she was very self-conscious and kind 
of shy." 
</P>
<P>
 She also returned to acting class before the cameras rolled last fall. "I take 
acting lessons before I do any show," Keaton explains. "So I spent a month 
going back and working with the acting teacher just to get to know it more and 
work on it and figure out what I was going to do with her." 
</P>
<P>
 What was so challenging for Keaton was the fact that Earhart never exposed 
much of herself in newsreel footage or photographs. "There isn't much about her 
on film where she is confessing or revealing," Keaton says. "I feel in that 
sense you can take a license. Probably we are all off the mark, but so are a 
lot of other people. In essence, she had a dream, a big dream and she followed 
her dream and she almost fulfilled it. In a sense, she almost did. She didn't 
get all the way around the world. But she's a great character and a great 
person to take on her vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Keaton acknowledges -- and the film also illustrates -- the fact that Earhart 
may have been the most famous female flyer, but she was far from the best. 
Keaton points out, though, that Earhart had the right combination for success: 
"She had a powerful man behind her. She had a great personality, those winning 
American looks. She was the darling. I think it takes everything to become a 
legend and a heroine and somebody who accomplished what she accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Filming the highly emotional, claustrophobic conclusion, in which Earhart and 
Noonan realize they are out of gas and lost over the Pacific, was harrowing for 
Keaton. She spent a lot of time preparing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the ways I do it is I have to sit there with headphones and listen to 
music. I have to get very upset and that is hard for me. It was pretty horrible 
being in that cockpit. It was so tight and we had to sit up there for hours and 
just live with it and live with the discomfort of this. It was like we were 
lost in this little world. Ugh. But it was good for making that scene more 
uncomfortable, which is what it should have been." 
</P>
<P>
 "Amelia Earhart: Her Final Flight" premieres Sunday at 5, 7 and 9 p.m. on TNT; 
it repeats Wednesday at 7 p.m. and June 19, 20, 24 and 26.

CRIMINAL PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago the waters of the Chicago River broke through ancient 
retaining walls and flooded long-unused tunnels deep beneath the Loop, 
disrupting utilities, creating chaos and paralyzing mid-town for days. Sara 
Paretsky has used the event as the center of her latest V. I. Warshawski novel, 
TUNNEL VISION (Delacorte: $21.95; 432 pp.).  
</P>
<P>
 In a series of such uniformly high quality it's hard to make comparisons, but 
I think the new book is one of Paretsky's very best. She writes as always with 
impassioned anger at corruption, most especially as it involves the 
exploitation and abuse of the weak by the strong. And, also as always, Vic (for 
Victoria) Warshawski is relentless, headstrong, much abused in body and spirit, 
risking much and suffering much but seeing as best she can that justice is 
done. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot this time involves a complicated money-laundering scheme that hinges 
on scams involving efforts to help the homeless. The corruption infects almost 
everyone in sight who has power, from the Senate down to the precincts. It is a 
story of nonstop immediacy and action, peopled with vivid and often tragically 
affecting characters and reaching an end whose satisfactions are to be measured 
against the casualties, including a romance ruptured. Paretsky remains unique 
among the women writing about women. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovering new voices is always a particular pleasure in crime fiction, and 
Mark Stern, a lawyer in the Justice Department in Washington, is an unusually 
commanding new voice. His INADMISSIBLE (Carroll & Graf: $19.95; 215 pp.) looks 
into the world of capitol politics and a high-powered law firm. Stern writes 
with authority, economy, pace and fresh invention. 
</P>
<P>
 His Peter Fallon is a young lawyer in a firm dominated by an irascible figure 
legendary for his skill at snatching acquittals from seemingly unavoidable 
convictions. With his mentor's help and some surprising late evidence, Fallon 
gets a senator acquitted on sexual harassment charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the mentor dies. Murdered, we may confidently assume. There is another 
murder and indications the senator is in fact a monster. Stern's message is 
that the lust for power is as corrupting as power itself, and his well-built 
story is a persuasive case. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Kerr, an Edinburgh-born journalist living in London, writes compellingly 
about crime and other villainies in postwar -- and now post-Cold War -- Europe. 
His DEAD MEAT (Mysterious Press: $18.95; 239 pp.) is a markedly unusual police 
procedural set in present St. Petersburg. It is narrated by a visiting 
inspector from Moscow, ostensibly observing how the locals deal with the Mafia 
but in fact sniffing out signs of police corruption. (Corruption is in the air 
this month.) 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance, the Mafia is not the familiar Italo-American brand but a 
kind of generic for the racially organized gangs operating in the dismembered 
Soviet Union. As the (uncorrupted) Mafia expert in St. Petersburg, Yvgeni 
Grushko, itemizes them, the gangs are "Ukranian, Byelorussian, Georgian, 
Chechen, Armenian, Tazhak, Azerbaijani, Kazahk." 
</P>
<P>
 His acknowledgments indicate that Kerr did a lot of on-the-spot research, with 
full cooperation from the police. You can believe it: The portrait of a Russia 
in painful change is abundantly atmospheric and minutely detailed. (A nice 
touch: the significance of cigarette packets opened from the bottom so that 
dirty fingers don't touch the filters, a sign of a gulag or prison veteran.) 
</P>
<P>
 The gang wars and the murder of a crusading journalist carry resonances of 
Prohibition. Kerr's procedural reaches well beyond "Gorky Park." 
</P>
<P>
 In such free time he has after his McNeil-Lehrer News Hour chores, Jim Lehrer 
writes a very amusing series about One-Eyed Mack, the lieutenant-governor of 
Oklahoma, a keen hand at deciphering crimes only a lieutenant- governor can 
solve. In FINE LINES (Random House: $20; 200 pp.) someone is bumping off key 
legislators, and the month's insistent theme of corruption surfaces again. 
</P>
<P>
 But beneath Lehrer's lightly and engagingly satiric voice (his wife wins the 
Chocolate Sash award for her merchandising know-how), it is clear that Lehrer 
is making points about fine lines indeed, as between right and wrong, good and 
evil, the uses and misuses of power -- and the perennial question about means 
justifying ends. Which means, what ends? A thoughtful work, and deceptively 
casual, you could rightly say. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ignatius, a Washington Post editor with considerable time and experience 
abroad, writes international espionage and high finance thrillers, of which his 
new one, THE BANK OF FEAR (Morrow: $20; 349 pp.) is a sizzling instance, the 
last of a trilogy ("Siro," "Agents of Innocence") about the U.S. involvement in 
the Middle East over the last quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Hoffman, the son of an old-time CIA man in the area, is a financial 
investigator in London, asked by a terrified Filipino to look into the murder 
of his wife. Both worked for a mysterious Arab businessman who controls 
billions in assets presumably belonging to the Ruler (no other identification) 
of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignatius's confident familiarity with spy-craft, the territory and the 
high-level use of computers to move money around (and hide it) is very 
impressive. Hoffman and, more particularly, an Arab woman he befriends in the 
mysterious bank, open a can of worms that are the size and lethality of cobras. 
There are grisly scenes of torture not for the queasy. In the end it is not 
clear whether the book is Hoffman's or Lina Alwan's, only that it is engrossing 
all the way. And if the goings-on seem occasionally preposterous, so does 
Middle East history. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Maron's "Bootlegger's Daughter," which introduced Judge Deborah 
Knott, won all the major mystery awards its year. SHOOTING AT LOONS (Mysterious 
Press: $18.95; 229 pp.) is the third in the series. The judge, on temporary 
assignment to a court in coastal North Carolina, hopes to get in a little beach 
time. But there is a murdered fisherman, seething rivalries between developers 
and the old-timers and a pervading sense that there's more trouble to come. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the earlier books, Maron evokes environments with great detail and 
sensitive insight. The scale may be intimate, but it is not superficial, and 
the reader gets to know the town and its social gradations very well. The plot 
is no great puzzle, but the milieu and the characters are what matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest of Simon Brett's novels about near-alcoholic English actor Charles 
Paris, A RECONSTRUCTED CORPSE (Scribner's: $29; 189 pp.) is so fraught with a 
mix of melancholy and angry satire that you have the feeling the series has 
reached a crossroads. Paris is playing a corpse (or a man about to be a corpse) 
in enactments for a true-crime television series. The series' snarlingly 
cynical host-creator and the ambience of the show allow Brett to depict and 
savage the medium at its most exploitative. 
</P>
<P>
 But dear Charles, unquenchably athirst for Bell's Scotch, seems hardly a 
footfall away from Skid Row. His agent despises him, his estranged wife is more 
impatient with him than ever. Even the nasty reviews of his work he is always 
quoting seem this time more hurtful than amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles solves a pair of murders and the plot is intricate if not baffling. 
But he does seem ready for a change. Perhaps he should be cast in "The 
Mousetrap" and live happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime fictioneers as various as John D. MacDonald and Rochelle Majer Krich 
began in paperbacks before making the leap to hardcover. Another candidate is 
Leonard S. Goldberg, a Los Angeles physician who writes medical thrillers. His 
new one, A DEADLY PRACTICE (Signet softcover: $4.99, 320 pp.) pits Goldberg's 
doctor heroine, Joanna Blalock, against the perp of some uniquely ghastly 
murders of medical personnel at the fictitious Memorial Hospital in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg keeps Dr. Blalock in jeopardy and the culprit almost too 
well-concealed, but the sense of events happening in a real institution matches 
the work of other, longer-established doctors who write. The sights, sounds, 
smells and routines of a great hospital become a character in the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in philosophical musings about crime-writing are directed to 
Nicolas Freeling's CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (Godine: $22.95, 155 pp.) a slim but 
potent collection of essays by one of the masters of the craft. "Nearly all 
good writers are 'crime-writers,' " Freeling says, "for this is the area where 
those deep-hidden movements of the heart are seen naked." 
</P>
<P>
 He makes the case in quite densely compact essays on Georges Simenon, Dorothy 
L. Sayers, Dickens, Joseph Conrad, Stendhal, Rudyard Kipling, Conan Doyle and 
Raymond Chandler. The judgments are sometimes tough and provocative, and he 
laments the decline of Chandler after only four notable books. Yet Chandler 
reinvented what Freeling calls the "krimi:" "the tale of sudden, unexplained 
violence and the smell of fear." 
</P>
<P>
 What he demolishes with scorn is the notion that crime-writing is a sort of 
sub-genre, somehow not to be taken as seriously as other fiction. There may 
better or less good writing, Freeling is saying, but "the nature of crime is 
also the nature of art."

 Re the finale of "Star Trek: The Next Generation": What a disappointment the 
final episode was. The plot was inconsistent with the characters' development 
of the last seven years. Although it is likely that Picard and Crusher marry, 
it is unlikely a man who is an expert in diplomacy would fail at his own 
marriage.

ON THE TOWN: FOR BARTER OR WORSE; EXCHANGE GUNS FOR GOODS? ALL IT TAKES IS A 
LITTLE INCENTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patt Morrison 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are such nice, redemptive, even cathartic feelings attached to swapping 
bad things for good ones, like trading Uzis for Janet Jackson concert tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Give up that century-old Mauser carbine and get seats at a Mighty Ducks game. 
Hand over the .38 Smith & Wesson and walk -- well, drive -- away with $75 worth 
of transmission work. Exchange a .22 for a carwash and wax. 
</P>
<P>
 Until its monthlong drop-your-gun amnesty ended last week, the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department gave away nothing but warm fuzzies in its "Give Up 
Your Guns for Mother's Day, With No Questions Asked" program. And still, on Day 
One alone, people surrendered two shotguns, five rifles and two handguns. If 
precedent holds, they'll be melted down at a foundry that turns gats into rebar 
-- a much-appreciated post-quake trade for us all. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns for goods is not novel, of course, except for the caliber. For several 
Christmases now, Alliance for Survival in Venice has taken in children's war 
toys and handed out teddy bears in their stead. 
</P>
<P>
 Barter is the oldest and gentlest form of commerce and still the most 
enticing: The allure of getting a bargain and the risk of getting skinned has 
it all over the crass transfer of cash. Jack got the deal of a lifetime when he 
exchanged a cow for magic beans. Aladdin got snookered when he gave up his 
battered old enchanted lamp for an ordinary new one. 
</P>
<P>
 The "swop" column in Yankee is always the best part of that magazine, full of 
delicious offers from someone wanting an almost-new skiff in return for the 
yield of 20 acres of sugar maples . . . or an 18th-Century Bible-verse sampler 
for a new or rebuilt engine to a John Deere combine. 
</P>
<P>
 So why stop at guns? Extend the deal to any vice, any dangerous or unhealthy 
substance. Coax out the man who's cached DDT in his potting shed. Think 
behavior modification. Think incentives: 
</P>
<P>
 Turn in shoes with four-inch heels . . . and you'll go home with a pair of 
Birkenstocks and a coupon good for a half-hour with an orthopedist. 
</P>
<P>
 Your gold card . . . a signed thank-you letter from Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons-grade plutonium . . . lunch with Warren Christopher and your own 
consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Butter . . . five pounds of oat bran. Hand over your coconut-oiled movie 
popcorn as well and get a Susan Powter tape. (Turn in Susan Powter and win the 
gratitude of the nation's hairstylists.) 
</P>
<P>
 Blush wines . . . Kool-Aid. (You won't notice the difference, honest.) 
</P>
<P>
 Firecrackers . . . a junior firefighter's helmet, plus your mother's solemn 
pledge to never again nag you with, "Be careful with that or you'll put your 
eye out!" 
</P>
<P>
 Press-on nails . . . typing lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent video games . . . a deluxe Parcheesi game set. 
</P>
<P>
 An Alan Robbins campaign button . . . a Tom Hayden campaign button. 
</P>
<P>
 A can of spray paint . . . a box of No. 2 pencils and a book on penmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 A Barbie doll . . . one training bra, unpadded, and the junior edition of "Our 
Bodies, Ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 A gas-swilling, air-soiling clunker . . . Ed Begley Jr.'s bike. 
</P>
<P>
 TV remote control . . . a Thighmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Oreos . . . fat-free Fig Newtons. 
</P>

guaranteed to protect your skin through the total disappearance of the ozone 
layer. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaf blower . . . a rake and a compost bin. 
</P>
<P>
 The book "The Bridges of Madison County" . . . the video "Thelma & Louise."

 Cigarettes . . . nothing. This one is its own reward.

'SEINFELD': THE REALITY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I disagree completely with Matthew Okada who asked, "What's so great about 
'Seinfeld'?" (TV Times, May 22). I'll tell you what's so great about 
"Seinfeld": It's the best-written, most sophisticated and funniest show on TV, 
and in its random disjointedness it is the sitcom that is closest to real life.

 The Adventures of Pete & Pete. It's like a sitcom in the "Twilight Zone." Two 
brothers with the same name. Summer rituals of "beating up" waves. Defiant 
stands of staying up for 11 days. The quirky comedy has moved into 
Nickelodeon's Saturday night programming block called "Snick" (as in Saturday 
Night Nickelodeon). 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of "Pete & Pete" pushes "Roundhouse" into the 
it's-summer-so-kids-can-stay-up-later slot at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Twisted tales and celebrity guests highlight the series, which focuses on the 
two Pete Wrigleys who live in a skewed suburbia with Dad and Mom Wrigley, who 
has a metal plate in her head. Big Pete is played by 16-year-old Michael 
Maronna; Little Pete is played by Danny Tamberelli, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-way East Coast-West Coast conversation between Michael and Danny and 
an inquiring mind reveals how wry (Michael) and earnest (Danny) the two actors 
can get. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimicking Don Pardo, Michael booms, "The show's well worth watching!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We get the best guest stars," Danny says of the series, which has drawn 
popsters from Deborah Harry, Marshall Crenshaw, Julianna Hatfield and Syd Straw 
to R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe. 
</P>
<P>
 As bizarre as the show gets -- and it can get out there -- the TV siblings are 
confident the oddness accounts for the show's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 An outgrowth of some rather odd 60-second spots, "Pete & Pete" became a series 
last November. The spots were as offbeat as the series they spawned: teaching 
kids how to play stocking-head freeze tag; asking what they'd do for a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael may be best known to movie audiences as Macaulay Culkin's tormenting 
older brother in "Home Alone." "I'm the nasty one who says, 'Kevin, you're such 
a disease,' " Michael muses. In real-life, Michael's the oldest to a brother, 
14, and a sister, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Danny, who thinks of his on-screen brother as the real thing, went 
from commercials to the soap "Ryan's Hope" before landing the role of Little 
Pete in 1989. Danny's the oldest kid at home also. He has two little sisters, 
ages 7 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a little like our characters," volunteers Danny, who, unlike Little 
Pete, is not tattooed. "I'm particularly like Little Pete because he's very 
outgoing . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "And he needs a beating," Michael interjects in true brotherly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "No I don't," Danny says. "Don't listen to him!" 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Danny confesses, "We get along really well and got close quick. I'd say 
he's like a brother to me." 
</P>
<P>
 "And he's like a father to me," Michael deadpans. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the two actors sound more like "normal" brothers than their 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bigger and older than he is, like my character," jokes Michael. "But Big 
Pete's more of a straight man than I am. He's like the normal guy in the weird 
town. I'm more of the weird guy in a normal town." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wrigley boys, Michael and Danny point out, are named Pete and Pete, 
"because it rhymes." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can do stuff that regular kids can't, like stay up all night, start a band 
in a day, be a big hit, have your own radio station," Danny says. 
</P>
<P>
 Both actors attend regular school -- Michael in Queens and Danny in New Jersey 
-- every other week and are tutored when on the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is particularly happy with this setup. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're either ahead and then get bored when you are there . . . ," Danny 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or you fall behind and then are given to sloth," Michael finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, it's often Danny who's straight man to Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny plays ice hockey and video games and collects comic books. "I'm just 
kind of like a regular kid. I want to be an actor or a rock-band bassist or I 
want to play professional hockey or football," he says. To which Michael 
responds: "I skateboard and make fun of people. I want to be a professional 
groupie. Actually, I am totally unscrupulous; I just want to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny, in what seems a diversionary tactic, pipes in, "My favorite subject is 
social studies!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine," Michael says, "is lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 When it's time for them to hang up, Danny, who announces he's reading John 
Grisham's "The Client," adds he's working on a script. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doh!" Michael says in a dead-on Homer Simpson impersonation. "You can't get 
past the storyboard!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already done three pages!" Danny shoots a raspberry back. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael has his own production aspirations. After he finishes reading Ayn 
Rand's "Atlas Shrugged," he hopes to make it into a short film. Eventually, 
there will be college in his future. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, both boys hope being added to the Snick block will draw even more 
of an audience to the show. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't mind that school ends June 27 and that shooting for the fall season 
probably starts the day after. "That," Michael says, more than a little 
tongue-in-cheek, "Is the price we pay for our art!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Adventures of Pete & Pete" airs Saturdays at 8:30 p.m. and repeats Sunday 
at 12:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon. For ages 6 and up.

PALM LATITUDES: CLIQUES; GETTING THE MESSAGE

 When Greg, 21 and deaf, told his friends about his AIDS diagnosis, word spread 
quickly through the deaf community's grapevine. Within days, the news had been 
distorted: Greg was dead. The real surprise, however, was that this was the 
first time some in the community had heard of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans have learned about AIDS through news media. But many deaf 
people, particularly those not fluent in American Sign Language, have reading 
skills below the sixth-grade level, which means that they have trouble 
understanding even close-captioned TV news items. "Many of them barely know 
even a little about AIDS," says Heidi Kleiger, program manager of the Greater 
Los Angeles Council on Deafness. "Some might recognize the word, but not much 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 In the insular, tightly knit deaf community, information is often transmitted 
electronically, on TDDs, devices that send typed messages over phone lines. It 
is a key part of the community's powerful grapevine, where, like any gossip 
chain, distortions are rife. "Many deaf people think AIDS is transmitted by 
mosquitoes and monkeys," says Stephan Kennedy, director of AIDS Education 
Services for the Deaf, an Eagle Rock-based program started in 1987. "One man 
wrote, 'I got HIV through sex, now I stop sex and HIV finish,' " he says. 
Statistics are hazy, but between 7,000 and 26,000 deaf people have HIV or AIDS 
in the United States, the L.A. Council on Deafness says.  
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's group runs programs for deaf women and youths and holds about 15 
workshops each month. The six-person group, funded by the federal Ryan White 
Act, works under the auspices of the Council on Deafness and serves about 60 
clients a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Major Los Angeles-based AIDS organizations are just beginning to provide 
significant services for deaf clients under mandates of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, which guarantees equal access to federally funded programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many complain that it costs too much money for interpreters or special 
services for the deaf," says Kennedy, who provides sensitivity training to the 
staffs of about 50 AIDS agencies each year. "But now, it's federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy comes up with dozens of versions of educational messages because the 
deaf have more than 20 different kinds of sign language and other communication 
modes. And he must break the misinformation chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play gossip games at workshops that teach the deaf how information is 
spread incorrectly," Kennedy says. "And we teach them how to pass on the right 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 But his job is complicated by the distortions of the deaf grapevine. "It is so 
powerful," says Kennedy, who is himself deaf. "It can never really be broken."

ALL KINDS OF OLDER WOMEN; THE NEW OURSELVES, GROWING OLDER, BY PAULA B. 
DORESS-WORTERS AND DIANA LASKIN SIEGAL , IN COOPERATION WITH THE BOSTON WOMEN'S 
HEALTH BOOK COLLECTIVE (TOUCHSTONE/SIMON & SCHUSTER: $18; 531 PP., PAPERBACK)

<P>
 Reading "The New Ourselves, Growing Older," a resource book for women over 40, 
is a little like having lunch with your favorite elderly aunt, the one who was 
a feminist before it was fashionable. You love her to death. You appreciate her 
advice on life, love and hemlines. You just wish she wouldn't whine about how 
hard it was in her day for women to prove themselves. You wish she would 
realize that things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a smart, hip aunt, this book (an updated version of the 1987 "Ourselves, 
Growing Older"), produced in cooperation with the Boston Women's Health Book 
Collective, is brimming with excellent information, including discussions on 
everything from midlife childbirth to hot flash management and dental health. 
"Ourselves" is modeled after the successful "Our Bodies, Ourselves," which was 
first published in cooperation with the collective in 1971 and widely regarded 
as a milestone in feminist health care. 
</P>
<P>
 What threatens to spoil the new book, though, are statements that might 
reflect the frustrations and perceptions of individual writers more than 
hard-and-fast data -- statements that seem, for the most part, not true 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples: The chapter on exercise, which encourages weight training, notes 
that "society has stereotyped women as soft, round, weak and submissive" but 
allows that the picture is changing. That should read "has already changed," at 
least at Los Angeles gyms, where the lines for the stair-climbers, treadmills 
and weights are gender-balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 In another chapter, "Our Looks and Our Lives," comes the statement that 
"middle-aged women, seen primarily as mothers, are considered to be past their 
social usefulness because they are no longer bearers of children." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa. Did this miss the eyes of all volunteer manuscript readers and the 
editors? The footnote after the statement cites a book published in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Those criticisms aside, there's a lot to praise about the book and to suggest 
40-something women should buy one for themselves and another for their mom -- 
or that elderly aunt who picks up the lunch tab. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30 chapters overflow with information, mostly on health topics. But there 
are also chapters on money matters, care-giving and alternative living 
arrangements. It's a one-stop, quick-read source to educate yourself about 
menopause, money, middle-aged birth control, retirement planning, boomer 
childbirth and in general what to expect from your body and your mind with age. 
</P>
<P>
 The resources section includes well-known organizations such as the American 
Assn. of Retired Persons and the National Organization for Women (NOW), along 
with interesting, lesser-known sources such as the American Dietetic Assn. 
toll-free information line and a Massachusetts-based firm that specializes in 
outdoor vacations for women over 40. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is very PC. It devotes many pages to the special problems and 
concerns of married, widowed and divorced as well as never-married women. It 
gives equal time to the concerns of lifelong heterosexuals, lifelong lesbians 
and those who switch orientation at midlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Women will discover options they've probably never thought about, such as a 
group living arrangement described by one woman. She resides with 11 other 
adults who rotate chores so each person cooks dinner only a few times a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Another highlight is the liberal sprinkling of anecdotes throughout, 
identified only by the age of the contributor and collected by the co-authors 
from letters, personal conversations and other sources. These stories run the 
gamut from practical to humorous and poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a report from a woman, now 80, who divorced at 37 and finally landed a 
teaching job after starting out as school secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 A 51-year-old woman reveals that she knew she was middle-aged when a "quickie" 
began to take 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A 78-year-old woman admits that she still mourns the death of her daughter 40 
years before but is doing better. "Now I can accept what happened, even if I 
don't like it," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether women skim this book or digest it cover-to-cover, they will be better 
prepared to answer the question that opens the last chapter: 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of an older woman do I want to be?" Doing It for Themselves 
</P>
<P>
 While readers will understandably be tempted to use the voluminous "New 
Ourselves, Growing Older" as an encyclopedia, looking up facts as needed, the 
co-authors hope women will approach it more as a novel. "I would urge women to 
read it through," said one co-author, Paula Laskin Siegal in a phone interview. 
"If they only look up a subject of interest, they are going to miss an awful 
lot in the prefaces and opening chapters that apply to women of all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 This edition is the second team effort for Laskin Siegal and Paula B. 
Doress-Worters. They worked together on the original 1987 book. Updating for 
the second edition took about 18 months, Doress-Worters recalls. "Every chapter 
went through three drafts," explains Laskin Siegal. Each draft was reviewed by 
women who had experienced the topics under discussion, by medical or other 
appropriate experts and by a corps of about 300 volunteer readers. Once the 
drafts arrived back with comments, the co-authors would spread them out on a 
table and decide which revisions to make. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 45 contributing writers, but nagging writers to meet deadlines 
wasn't part of the scenario, according to Doress-Worters. "Older women are very 
focused on what they want to accomplish," she notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic message they want to communicate, says Laskin Siegal, is the same as 
that conveyed in the first "Our Bodies, Our Selves" book: "We are quite capable 
of understanding our bodies." The other message? "Aging is part of the life 
span, not a medical event," Laskin Siegal adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides serving as a good information source, the co-authors say they have 
heard their book is serving as a jumping-off point for daughters and aging 
mothers to broach difficult topics, such as nursing homes and life-threatening 
disease. Another fringe benefit, Laskin Siegal hopes, is that women who read 
the volume will get "a feeling of community and solidarity."

BOYS INTO MEN; WE'VE TAUGHT MOTHERS TO TOUGHEN UP THEIR SONS BY STANDING ASIDE. 
CAN WE BE SURPRISED OUR MEN CAN'T RELATE TO WOMEN?; THE COURAGE TO RAISE GOOD 
MEN: A MANIFESTO FOR CHANGE, BY OLGA SILVERSTEIN AND BETH RASHBAUM (VIKING: 
$21.95; 275 PP.)

<P>
 The other day my friend, who has a daughter, was complaining about cartoons 
and kids' stories. Even now, she said, the protagonists are usually boys, and 
too many of the heroines just wait around for the prince. I was secretly 
relieved: My son will not lack images of active boys. But when I thought about 
it, I started to worry too. I don't want him to grow up thinking that girls are 
just the backdrop for boys' accomplishments. What to do? Lately, there's been a 
spate of books on raising feminist daughters. Now, there's a book for those of 
us with sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Silverstein, in "The Courage to Raise Good Men," says that men suffer 
from emotional isolation and pain, and that women suffer from misogyny. And she 
provocatively locates the crux of both problems in the mother-son relationship. 
The experts are wrong, she says: Mothers do not need to push away their boys to 
raise them to be men. Even readers who don't follow Silverstein as far as this 
theory takes her will find this a challenging, serious and (presumably thanks 
to co-author Beth Rashbaum) readable book. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverstein calls conventional wisdom on boys "the lone ranger" theory. Woven 
throughout her book are her analyses of the messages in myth, literature and 
pop culture about mothers and sons. From Achilles to Dr. Spock, she says, the 
primary lesson for the mother has been to toughen up her boy by getting out of 
the way. If she doesn't, we believe she risks contaminating him with her 
femininity and creating a sissy, a psycho or a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Advised to stand back, says Silverstein, many mothers withdraw from their sons 
or push them away. This section makes good reading, because Silverstein draws 
on convincing case histories from her family therapy practice, and a poignant 
reconsideration of her own experience raising a son. 
</P>
<P>
 We "elevate the boy" above his mother, Silverstein argues, when what he still 
needs is for her to be in charge. She cites the casual mandate when dad 
departs: "Take care of your mother!" She tells of the mom who was rather proud 
of not being able to control her 3-year-old: "He's strong-willed like his 
father." When their sons hit adolescence, mothers may suddenly "dumb out," 
convinced they can no longer discipline a boy. And some mothers carry 
self-sacrifice too far; says Silverstein dryly, "A man who does not know his 
mother as a separate person is at a great disadvantage with women generally." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverstein bluntly calls all of these withdrawals abandonment. These boys, 
she says, betrayed by the person who nurtured them most and longest -- their 
mother -- become lonely, angry, sometimes violent men who don't like women very 
much. "The real pain in men's lives," she says, "stems from their estrangement 
from women." 
</P>
<P>
 A mothers who doesn't let this happen, she suggests, commits a revolutionary 
act. Her son will be happier, and he'll also be less contemptuous of those 
qualities we call feminine. Maybe he won't need to perpetuate a system that 
denigrates women. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side of the deeply ingrained belief that mothers should step back to 
let sons become men might be expressed as "it takes a man to make a man." 
Silverstein challenges that advice, too. Sons are not copies of their fathers, 
she says; good parents teach and guide children to be themselves. That means 
either gender can do the job, she argues, pithily observing, "Being taught by a 
woman isn't emasculating: failure is." She reassures single mothers that they 
need not be obsessed with finding "male role models" to replace all those 
missing fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so. We all know men whose fathers were largely absent, yet who are 
undoubtedly men . But Silverstein's narrow focus leaves a lot out. I was 
uncomfortable, for example, with her scathing analysis of Robert Bly and the 
"mythopoetic men's movement." Yes, it's scary to hear men suggest they need to 
drum all mother's influence out. But I do think they've put a finger on the 
genuine pain men feel about their absent fathers. And acknowledging that need 
not detract from pain caused by estrangement from their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverstein also made me nervous when I read her assessment that most men 
"were not raised for empathic parenting," (though she clearly says some are 
capable). That means, once again, that the job of raising the kids right (not 
to mention the job of changing the world) basically belongs to the mother. 
Silverstein argues that it will be a joy, not a burden, for women to raise sons 
to respect instead of reject them. Still, I wish she'd emphasized that fathers 
who do build strong emotional ties with their children also alter the dynamic 
that turns little boys into "lone rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a lot of what Silverstein describes rings true -- even embarrassingly 
true. Like a woman in one of the case studies, I panicked when the amnio showed 
I was pregnant with a boy. Maybe it was my stepsons' crowing about how they'd 
teach him to throw a baseball, but I began to wonder if I had anything to give 
a son. "Relax," said my single mother friend who has raised two boys. "He'll be 
a baby for a long time before he's a boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverstein in "The Courage to Raise Good Men" extends that reassurance to a 
lifetime of mothering. Her book will help mothers understand the implications 
of pushing boys out of the family before they're ready to go. I think a lot of 
mothers will take her advice.

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; THE LONE STAR OF ISLAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sharon Whitley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Nancy Lydick left Texas for L.A. back in 1978, her family thought she was 
doomed. "My father was aghast," she recalls. "None of the women in our family 
had ever left Texas. They thought I'd get into drugs, that there'd be an 
earthquake and everything would fall into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs were not a problem, though earthquakes were, and Lydick's life did take 
on a La La Land cast: She became a psychologist, changed religions twice and 
wound up on TV, the only American woman to co-anchor an internationally 
televised show for Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Born a Christian, Lydick explored several denominations before converting to 
Judaism at 30. Then in 1982, Lydick met a Muslim man from West Africa. "I was 
impressed with his inner peace. He gave me a copy of the Koran. It made sense 
to me; everything I had studied and knew fell together, all my questions were 
answered," Lydick says. 
</P>
<P>
 During her long quest "for the truth and universal oneness," she had also been 
flirting with show biz, acting in several plays and once on "Dallas." Her 
dramatic and spiritual pursuits merged in 1985 when she won her job on "Islam," 
a newsmagazine show that is taped here and broadcast in the Mideast, Asia, 
Mexico and the United States (though not in L.A.). On camera, her name is 
Nashiha al-Sakina -- "tranquil adviser" -- an apt nom de TV for a psychologist 
who teaches at National University's L.A. campus and has a private therapy

 Meanwhile, the eyes of the Lone Star state watch in bemusement. "Although my 
conservative family still can't quite understand it, they have shifted from 
thinking I've lost my mind to having admiration, respect and love for me," says 
Lydick, who is divorced and has two children and three grandkids. "They don't 
think of me as some crazy person who belongs to a cult anymore." Sharon Whitley

 WILDERNESS ABOVE THE SOUND: The Story of Mount Ranier National Park by Arthur 
D. Martinson (Roberts Rinehart: $11.95; 76 pp.) . Martinson traces the history 
of one of America's first National Parks in this slim volume. The spectacular 
beauty of the volcanic cone and surrounding forests inspired a preservation 
campaign that lead to its protection from development in 1893. Martinson 
supplements his narration of the struggle to maintain the park in its natural 
state while admitting increasing numbers of visitors with a wonderful array of 
turn-of-the-century photographs.

 INDEX ON CENSORSHIP: The Magazine for Free Speech May/June 1994 (c/o Virgin 
Mailing & Distribution, 10 Camptown Road, Irvington, N.J. 07111; $48 for one 
year , six issues; 256 pp., illustrated). Published in Great Britain, this 
newly revamped magazine is devoted to banned literature and challenges to 
freedom of expression throughout world.In recent years, free speech has come 
under increasing fire not only from fundamentalists and dictators, its 
traditional foes, but liberal groups seeking to limit expression they find 
unpalatable. Ronald Dworkin denounces the folly of maintaining "that those 
whose opinions are too threatening or base or contrary to the moral or 
religious consensus have forfeited any right to the concern on which the right 
rests" because "such a reservation would destroy the principle: it would leave 
room only for the pointless grant of protection for ideas or tastes or 
prejudices that those in power approve, or in any case do not fear."

 AMERICAN NATURE WRITING 1994 edited by John A. Murray (Sierra Club Books: $12; 
229 pp., paperback original). This volume marks the debut of an annual 
collection of essays "by new and distinguished voices."The most resonant 
entries are from familiar authors: Rick Bass calls for a ban on logging in the 
Yaak Valley of Montana with his familiar, eloquent passion; Barry Lopez deftly 
juxtaposes memories of apartment life in Manhattan and camping trips near the 
Grand Canyon. Among the new contributors, Sherry Simpson vividly describes the 
fear she felt watching a biologist tag anesthetized bears in Alaska. On the 
down side, Russell Chatham's account of salmon fishing in Iceland conflicts 
with spirit of the anthology, while Jennifer Brice's attempt to mythologize her 
pregnancy seems pretentious and artsy.

 THE MEN IN MY LIFE AND OTHER MORE OR LESS TRUE RECOLLECTIONS OF KINSHIP by 
James D. Houston (Greywolf Press: $12; 160 pp., paperback original). Houston 
tackles what are currently referred to as "guy things" in these introspective 
essays. His reflections on gaining respect from his college football team 
mates, rejecting the sham friendship produced by fraternity hazing and finding 
common ground with his father through music have more relevance to the lives of 
a healthy male in contemporary society than the drum-banging, role-playing 
games of the so-called men's movement.

 THE GENIUS OF DESIRE by Brian Bouldrey (Ballantine: $10; 274 pp.) . Bouldrey's 
first novel depicts a young man's coming of age in a weird Southern family 
dominated by a cadre of strong-willed females who style themselves "the Kaiser 
Broads." Bouldrey skillfully captures the claustrophobic discomfort of a small 
town during a humid summer, when the residents long for fresh air -- literally 
and metaphorically. Against this confining background, the narrator experiences 
his first tentative encounters with death and desire.

 MAMA MAKES UP HER MIND AND OTHER DANGERS OF SOUTHERN LIVING by Bailey White 
(Vintage: $10.; 229 pp.). The popular National Public Radio commentator 
discusses life in rural Georgia in these lively vignettes.Her eccentric, often 
cantankerous mother, who cooks road-kill animals and assumes command of any 
social situation, dominates the book. White describes her mother's house as a 
sort of beach where the flotsam of several generations has come to rest. When 
she attempts to clean for a visit from prospective in-laws, "Mama would not let 
us throw out a box of old photographs we found under the sofa -- 'I may 
remember who those people are someday.' " Readers who listen to "All Things 
Considered" will hear White's familiar drawl as they savor these memoirs of an 
unusual yet ordinary life.

 LAKE COUNTRY: A Series of Journeys by Kathleen Stocking (University of 
Michigan Press: 229 pp., paperback original). Stocking explores Michigan's 
Upper Peninsula in these intimate accounts of wandering the shores of the Great 
Lakes, listening to debates over development and following roads no longer 
traveled. After leaving a lonely island in Lake Huron, she realizes, "The 
thought of being home, feeding the animals, calling my neighbors, getting Gaia 
ready for school in the morning, seems comforting, like a lamp in a window on a 
dark night." Her agreeable prose falters when she stumbles into PC postures.

 THE SAINT: Alias the Saint by Leslie Charters (Carroll & Graf: $3.95; 179 pp.) 
. Long out of print, these two adventures introduce a new generation of readers 
to one of the great detectives of the '30s. Elegant, suave and irreverent, 
Simon Templer resembles Philo Vance more than Sam Spade: In "The National 
Debt," he appears "arrayed in green pajamas and a staggering silk dressing gown 
that would have made Joseph's coat look like a suit of deep mourning." 
Charters' polished descriptions will engage readers who only know his famous 
character from the old Roger Moore TV series.

NOT YOUR AVERAGE LITERARY READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Smith

<TEXT>
<P>
 James Ellroy approaches his readings as performance pieces, self-assuredly 
distant from the notion of retiring novelist uncomfortable in front of a crowd. 
The thought that the author of the "L.A. Quartet" and the recently-published 
"Hollywood Nocturnes" could be anything other than extreme seems hardly 
plausible. Intense, lurid, acerbic, quick-witted and funny, Ellroy reached new 
heights at the Met Theater. Packed with people -- even the aisles were jammed 
-- this Hollywood home to a long-running series of readings hosted a double 
bill of sorts: James Ellroy read from his novella, "Dick Contino's Blues," 
based on the real-life story of 1950s accordion star Dick Contino. He was 
followed by a live appearance by Mr. Accordion himself, accompanied on drums by 
his son, Peter Contino. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellroy articulates the sleaze-ball fury of his writing in an elegantly 
elongated way: He virtually acts out his fiction as he reads, standing with 
legs spread apart, Jack Purcell sneakers gripping the floor, arms moving, blue 
blazer, silk rep tie, white-collared pink shirt, not fooling anyone into 
mistaking him for a model of eastern literary sobriety. He read the prologue 
and first chapter of the story of Dick Contino's mid-professional life -- after 
the meteoric rise to stardom and the fall, he found himself, an accused draft 
dodger, trying to stage a comeback in late '50s Los Angeles. Contino's inner 
life is in contrast to the corrupt politicians, rogue cops, sex-crazed weirdos 
and gangsters of Ellroy's four-novel suite of decay and brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 The reading was inspired: Contino was drawn larger than life as 
co-conspirator, victim, utter oddball and bizarre artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Contino made the leap from the opening chapter's Crescendo Club stage in 1958 
to the Met Theater with a shy plunge into a set of 1950s accordion gems, 
interspersed with anecdotes about struggling with his zigzag career, the burden 
of being labeled a draft dodger (although he served two years in Korea and five 
in the Reserves; his realization that most people wanted a scapegoat, not the 
truth) and Ellroy's retrieval of Contino from pleasant obscurity in Las Vegas. 
Dick Contino, trim, tan and 60ish, tore the place up. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they answered questions in an almost brotherly way, two gifted 
misfits from an era in Los Angeles history that no one should live through 
again nor ever forget. Robert Smith

LONG LIVE CURMUDGEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for assigning Molly Ivins to review "Mencken" (Book Review, April 
24). Ivins is right that "the curmudgeon shortage in this country is 
critical.""Curmudgeons" are such fun to read -- even when (or especially when) 
we howl in disagreement over an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Curmudgeons are now held in check and suppressed due to the imposed political 
correctness. Lives and careers can be destroyed when "labels" are given to 
anyone who drops a casual remark, that is perceived as offensive or dangerous. 
A few killers: Communist, un-American, racist, Nazi, homophobic, anti-this or 
anti-that, pro-this or pro-that, anti-Semitic, Arab-lover, Arab-hater, 
abortionist, baby-killer and on and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, we become vanilla-flavored. A perfect example of the most 
perfect man is our President Bill Clinton; he is "nice" to everybody. Would 
that our country, and world, also be "nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Molly Ivins is a lovable curmudgeon. Long may she live!

 Curtain up. Light the lights. CBS airs the American Theatre Wing's 1994 
Antoinette Perry Awards Sunday evening from the Gershwin Theatre in the heart 
of New York's Broadway theater district. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Hopkins and Amy Irving are the hosts for the Tony proceedings, named 
after the late actress Antoinette Perry, who was chairman of the board and 
secretary of the American Theatre Wing through World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's musical "Passion" leads the pack this year 
with 10 nominations, followed by the musicals "Beauty and the Beast" and "She 
Loves Me" with nine each. "Angels in America: Perestroika," the second part of 
last year's Tony Award-winning best play, "Angels in America: Millenium 
Approaches," has six nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 A special Tony recognizing regional theater will be given to the McCarter 
Theatre in Princeton, N.J. And Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn will be the first 
recipients of a special Tony for lifetime achievement in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Awards over the years have produced their own share of drama. Among those 
moments:  
</P>
<P>
 * The first Tony Awards were presented in 1947. Jose Ferrer ("Cyrano de 
Bergerac") and Fredric March ("Years Ago") both won best dramatic actor. Ingrid 
Bergman ("Joan of Lorraine") and Helen Hayes ("Happy Birthday") won best 
dramatic actress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Renowned American playwright Arthur Miller, whose new Broadway play "Broken 
Glass" is nominated this year for best drama, has had major contacts with Tony: 
In 1949, his legendary "Death of a Salesman" won prizes for best play, best 
featured (a.k.a. supporting) actor (Arthur Kennedy), producer (Kermit 
Bloomgarden and Walter Fried) and director (Elia Kazan). Star Lee J. Cobb lost 
the best actor Tony to Rex Harrison for "Anne of the Thousand Days." 
</P>
<P>
 * Both Angela Lansbury and Tyne Daly received best actress (musical) Tonys for 
their performances as Mama Rose in revivals of the musical "Gypsy." Ironically, 
Ethel Merman, who originated the role in the initial production, didn't win the 
1960 best actress Tony. She lost to Mary Martin in "The Sound of Music." 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1952, Peter Feller won the best "stage technician" award for his work as 
master carpenter on the Irving Berlin musical "Call Me Madam." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rosalind Russell received a 1942 best actress nomination for her performance 
in the hit film "My Sister Eileen." In 1953, she won the best actress (musical) 
award for the musical version, "Wonderful Town." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ray Walston, currently appearing on CBS' "Picket Fences," won the best actor 
(musical) award for playing the Devil in the 1955 musical "Damn Yankees." 
Victor Garber plays Walston's role in the Broadway revival and is nominated for 
a Tony. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, Meredith Willson's "The Music Man" and Leonard Bernstein and Stephen 
Sondheim's "West Side Story" were both nominated for best musical. "The Music 
Man" beat "West Side Story" for the honors and also captured best actor (Robert 
Preston), featured actor (David Burns), featured actress (Barbara Cook), author 
(Willson, Franklin Lacey), producer (Kermit Bloomgarden, Herbert Greene, Frank 
Productions), composer and lyricist (Willson) and conductor and musical 
director (Herbert Greene). "West Side Story" only managed to win for 
choreography (Jerome Robbins) and scenic design (Oliver Smith). 
</P>
<P>
 * Warren Beatty received a nomination as best featured actor (dramatic) for 
his performance in William Inge's 1960 drama "A Loss of Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 * The classic Lerner-Loewe musical "Camelot" wasn't even nominated for best 
musical of 1960. "Bye Bye Birdie" ended up taking the honors. The two other 
nominees were "Do Re Mi" and "Irma La Douce." 
</P>
<P>
 * Davy Jones of The Monkees fame received a best featured actor (musical) 
nomination in 1963 for his performance as the Artful Dodger in "Oliver!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Barbra Streisand ("Funny Girl") lost the 1964 best actress (musical) Tony to 
Carol Channing for "Hello, Dolly!" Streisand played Channing's role in the 1969 
film version of "Hello, Dolly!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Vivien Leigh, who won best actress Oscars for 1939's "Gone with the Wind" 
and 1951's "A Streetcar Named Desire," won the best actress (musical) for 
1963's "Tovarich." 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Shaw, who starred in such films as "Jaws" and "The Sting," wrote the 
1969 Tony-nominated best play "The Man in the Glass Booth." 
</P>
<P>
 * Charles Kimbrough, who plays Jim Dial on "Murphy Brown," was nominated for 
best featured actor (musical) for 1970's "Company." 
</P>
<P>
 * Yul Brynner starred in both the Broadway and film versions of the musical 
"The King and I." Though he won the best actor Oscar for the 1956 film, he 
received the best featured actor (musical) Tony for the 1952 musical. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although Angela Lansbury has never received an Emmy for her work as Jessica 
Fletcher on "Murder, She Wrote," she has won four Tony Awards for best actress 
(musical): 1966's "Mame"; 1969's "Dear World"; 1975's "Gypsy" and 1979's 
"Sweeney Todd." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Cheers" star Bebe Neuwirth, currently on Broadway in the revival of "Damn 
Yankees," won a best featured actress (musical) Tony for the 1986 revival of 
"Sweet Charity." 
</P>
<P>
 * Alan Alda, a musical comedy star? Well, he was nominated for best actor 
(musical) for the 1967 musical "The Apple Tree." He lost the award to Robert 
Preston for "I Do! I Do!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Bosley, currently appearing on Broadway as Belle's befuddled father in 
"Beauty and the Beast," won the 1960 best featured actor (musical) Tony for his 
performance as New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia in "Fiorello!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The 48th Annual Tony Awards" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

 In his review of Jeremy Treglown's biography of Roald Dahl (Book Review, April 
17), Richard Eder writes, "As a bachelor in Washington, D.C., (Dahl) painted 
the genitals of the rhinoceroses on the Q Street bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 As someone whose in-laws live less than a hundred yards from that bridge, I 
don't know whether the mistake was a misperception by an overstimulated Dahl, 
or an error by his biographer, but I do know that those animals on the Q Street 
bridge are bison -- and indeed, many Georgetown residents refer to the 
structure affectionately as "the Buffalo Bridge." I do wish I had seen them in 
Dahl's war paint.

 I agree almost entirely with Walter Mosley's article "A Closed Book" (May 
29).The publishing industry may talk a good multicultural game, but it still 
doesn't hire people of color. It's not what was written that is amazing as much 
as having it printed. 
</P>
<P>
 Being in the movie industry for some 20 years and more, those same principles 
Mr. Mosley pointed out in the publishing business, applies to the motion 
picture and TV industry as well.

DOCTORS AND PATIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While reading the review of "A Whole New Life," by Richard Selzer (May 22), I 
was drawn into his candor and understanding of the pain and suffering of a 
cancer patient, given that he is a surgeon. My own experience with medical 
doctors is that often the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
 I do have a problem, however, with Selzer's statement regarding Price's anger 
toward his radiation oncologist, who he stated had "all the visible concern of 
a steel-cheese-grater." Selzer is quick to defend the doctor as a healer and 
compares the lack of bedside manner to the quirky personalities of great 
artists such as Beethoven. I found this to be an insult to those who rely upon 
the doctor for comfort when perhaps there is little left in the way of hope. Is 
it too much for a dying or suffering person to wish for a few kind words during 
the worst moments of their life? Should we accept from these individuals, who, 
by the way get paid much more than the artists he mentions, to be compassionate 
individuals. Healing is more than merely giving a prescription for chemotherapy 
or radiation, and doctors who lose their feelings of compassion are in my 
opinion burnt out and in need of a change of career.

 Richard Selzer defends the behavior of a physician by explaining that 
withholding pity and compassion can be necessary for some doctors, especially 
those working with terminally ill patients. I do not take issue with this. It 
is not until the reviewer goes on to compare the behavior of doctors to that of 
"great artists," many of whom have been "angry," "misanthropic" and 
"condescending," that I find fault with his argument. There is a major 
difference between artists and doctors, a difference which should be obvious to 
the reviewer, who is himself a doctor. Artists work with art, doctors work with 
people, and while it is no great sin for an artist to be misanthropic, for a 
doctor to hate mankind is a grave affront to the Hippocratic oath. Although I 
have no doubt that healing can be found in great works of art, it is not, nor 
has it ever been, the responsibility of artists to heal. Maybe it is time to 
remind Dr. Selzer of the line in his oath which states "and above all do no 
harm" and for him to take stock to the harm his attitude may be causing.

NEVER FORMALLY ACCUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an otherwise informative and commendable review of Murry Kempton's latest 
book ("Rebellions, Perversities, Main Events," Book Review, April 24), you 
committed a major error of fact that needs to be corrected. You referred to the 
accused "atom-spy Alger Hiss."Alger Hiss was never formally accused of atomic 
espionage or, for that matter, any other kind of espionage. He was charged with 
and tried for perjury in 1949. The trial ended in a "hung jury" and thus no 
verdict. Tried a second time in 1950, Hiss was convicted of perjury and 
sentenced to five years in prison. Had it not been for the "Red Scare" 
political atmosphere of the time and by normal "reasonable doubt" standards, 
Hiss might well have been acquitted on the perjury charge. Doubtless he would 
have been tried for espionage had the statute of limitations not expired, the 
alleged espionage by Whittaker Chambers' account having occurred before 1938. 
Since years later the contents of Chambers' "dumb waiter" documents and 
"Pumpkin Papers" were released under the Freedom of Information Act, one 
wonders if there was enough evidence even in 1950 to sustain an espionage 
conviction. Whether Alger Hiss really perjured himself is a debatable and 
lingering controversy from the "Red Scare" era, but even in that hysterical 
time nobody accused him of being an "atom-spy."

 The book "Colored People" by Henry Louis Gates Jr., reviewed in the Book 
Review May 8 is a disappointment to black Americans. It is unthinkable that a 
descendant of African slaves and chairman of the department of the 
Afro-American studies at Harvard University would, in the '90s, write a book in 
which he says to his two daughters: 
</P>
<P>
 "In your lifetime, I suspect, you will go from being African Americans to 
'people of color,' to being, once again 'colored people'. . . . I don't mind 
any of the names myself.But I have to confess that I like 'colored' best." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates should know that I and most of the 30 million descendants of aboriginal 
Africans, hence of slaves in America, do mind the name they are called. They 
have already rejected being called "Negro," "Afro-American" and "colored." Some 
of us have also rejected being called "African Americans" and "black," except 
"black" is considered to be the appropriate name to use when a descendant 
relates to "white racism." 
</P>
<P>
 While there may not be much hope for changing the mind of Papa Gates, I would 
like for his two daughters to know that 1) papa does not know best, in the 
matter of your true name and 2) your true name is "Americans of African 
descent."

 Once the pride of Los Angeles, the majestic movie palaces along Broadway have 
been increasingly down on their luck. Most recently, Metropolitan Theatres 
Corp. pulled out of the opulent Los Angeles Theater, a 1931 landmark designed 
by S. Charles Lee and noted for its 14-foot-tall chandeliers, French Baroque 
stairway and crystal fountain with marble fish. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Los Angeles Conservancy and the city's Community Redevelopment 
Agency struggle to find ways to keep the Los Angeles Theater and 11 other movie 
palaces alive, Gallery at 777, at 777 S. Figueroa St., has mounted an exhibit 
of recent color photographs. "The Final Curtain: Endangered Movie Palaces of 
Downtown Los Angeles," shot by Robert Berger and Anne Conser of Santa Monica, 
will be on display through July 29. Says gallery director Francie Kugelman: 
"Many people don't know these theaters exist. Perhaps if more people knew, we 
might be able to save them." BARBARA THORNBURG

<P>
 Judging by the up-to-the-moment crowd that turned out for Salt-N-Pepa and R. 
Kelly's recent concert at the Greek Theatre, the young and hip are swapping the 
everyday for the elegant. Industrial workwear in giant sizes has given way to 
softer-looking clothes, sometimes even designer labels, that are merely roomy. 
Extreme fashion statements have been relegated to hairstyles, fingernails and 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 What people weren't wearing was notable -- no sports or Afrocentric clothes. 
Quite a few guys ditched their sneakers for cowboy boots or thick-strapped 
sandals with socks. They also traded baseball caps for newsboy caps, or simply 
a Michael Jordan bald head with an earring or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though football, basketball and baseball apparel appears played out, the 
athletic look isn't dead. Rap divas Salt-N-Pepa came onstage wearing Everlast 
wrestler suits and hockey jerseys (like other rappers, they're fans of the 
fashion but not the sport). They also wore black push-up bras and striped tops 
that were cropped above the bust to look like little more than bands of fabric 
attached to sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the audience, female fans had creative ideas, too: hers-'n'-hers matching 
outfits, long knit dresses, nose studs and chokers made of wooden beads and 
raffia. Elaborate, one-of-a-kind hairstyles were astounding for their 
complexity. Hair was plastered to the head in serpentine spit curls, piled up 
into lacquered beehives, sprayed into early Supremes pixies, sliced into 
asymmetrical zigzags and extended with fake braids. 
</P>
<P>
 Male fans wore sunglasses well past sunset and chose one of two fashion 
directions: the casual designer vest with relaxed trousers or the dressy Cotton 
Club suit with offbeat vintage details. "Look at this," said Philip Nappier, in 
a dapper double-breasted suit, as he removed his derby to show off a vintage 
Stetson label. "Showing up without the hat and glasses, we'd look like anyone 
else." MAUREEN SAJBEL

VIVA VIDA; THIS RESTAURANT EXCELS IN THE UNEXPECTED -- SUCH AS A THEME-TO-ORDER 
PARTY ROOM 
</P>

 By dessert time at Vida that first night, I just couldn't tackle the big ones. 
Hunka Hunka Burnin' Love, a chocolate cake roll stuffed with banana mousse and 
peanut butter, would have to wait. Cookies and a shot of milk sounded just 
right. I could definitely have used a double, though, with the fudgy, 
cherry-studded "scooters" and the slender granola biscotti. Then I found the 
flattened fortune cookie, obviously homemade. A slip of paper trailed from one 
end. "Smile, it won't kill you," it said.  
</P>
<P>
 Everything else about Vida, a new restaurant in Los Feliz, is just as quirky 
as the desserts, from the dugout seating in the bar-cafe to the wonderfully 
whimsical presentation of the food and the wacky names for the dishes. Waiters 
wear what look like brown canvas pj's. Young denizens of the club scene sit 
elbow to elbow with regular folks from the neighborhood. Even the music is 
unusual. One minute you're listening to Satchmo or Billie Holliday, the next 
bobbing your head to a perky tune that makes you feel like one of the Munchkins 
dancing down the yellow brick road. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, the restaurant's working title was ". . ." A bit unpronounceable, 
until it was decided to thread the letters V I D A among the dots. The ellipses 
still show up as a handsome graphic on the menus, as porthole-shaped mirrors in 
the bar and as Dot Dot Dot, the name of the first appetizer: three round, 
jellied smoked fish salads, to be eaten, presumably, one-two-three. Shrimp 
comes three ways, too: steamed, grilled and in a tempura jacket, each set on a 
different salad, one of them fired with chile. Also delicious. Disks of shaved 
raw beef layered with crisp, sweet slices of Asian pear and piled high in a 
pool of green oil are strikingly good. Irresistibly light Cali calimari come 
piled in a brown paper box with a trio of sauces, the best a smoky roasted 
chile sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The punster in Vida's kitchen is Fred Eric, a Joachim Splichal protege who 
cooked at Olive and was a consulting chef at the prematurely defunct Lipp. 
Here, in the space that once housed Le Petite Chaya and Duplex, the 32-year-old 
chef finally has his own venue. And from all appearances, he seems to be having 
a grand time in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ty Cobb salad arrives in an unexpected form: a multicolored, intricately 
layered slab of noodles, crispy duck, warm spinach and tomatoes with a definite 
Thai twist; the whole thing resembles an illustration of geological strata in 
an old encyclopedia. Okra Winfrey Creole gumbo has plenty of clams and spicy 
andouille sausage piled around a rice-and-red-bean cake, but Eric has 
shortchanged the broth. I like this dish, but I miss that heat-seeking gumbo 
juice. The non-Caesar salad looks demure, until you take in the sleight of 
hand: Jicama has been cut to resemble Parmesan chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Gaudi could easily have been the architect of New Yorkshire, which 
starts with a foundation of Yorkshire pudding, then piles on mashed potatoes, 
creamed corn and a nice piece of steak grilled rare. Odd, yes. But take away 
all the trappings and it's familiar, well-executed cooking. And while Eric 
can't resist showing off his stuff, he also tries hard to accommodate the 
less-adventurous crowd with a generous porterhouse steak and "plain old 
lobster," as in grilled Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 When you sit down, the waiter offers hot towels and then returns with a 
complimentary focaccia, pale and puffed from the oven. Decorated with a plaid 
of chile and basil oils, it is filled with molten mozzarella cheese. You could 
follow this with soothing carrot-ginger soup, but only fanatical spinach 
fanciers would be enthralled by the garlicky Pop-I soup. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorite dishes turned out to be the packet of white fish wrapped in 
rice noodles that floats in a distinctive lemon-grass broth with Chinese 
broccoli, shiitake mushrooms and snow-pea shoots. But leathery pasta dough 
threatened to sink the three-cheese tortellini grande in a broth full of smoked 
chicken and vegetables. A pretty but bland open-faced pot pie was essentially 
mashed potatoes topped with a gardenful of colorful vegetables.  
</P>
<P>
 "For dessert," the waiter explains, "we offer small portions." This is a 
bright idea, since that's what most of us want anyway. I do love the tiny, 
tall-sided grapefruit tart and the deep chocolate French l'opera cake with a 
scoop of horchata ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Vida scores very high with its interesting -- and, yes, quirky -- wine list at 
extremely sensible prices. It's rare to find so many good bottles in the 
$20-and-below range. Wines are organized into a dozen categories. For example, 
from the wines grouped under Soft-Supple-Round-Rich, you might choose the '91 
Kistler Pinot Noir, $30, to drink with Mr. Frenchy, a deconstructed pot au feu 
of grilled beef in a vegetable-laced broth. Or from the Spicy-Steely-Earthy 
portion, the fragrant, bone-dry '92 Riesling from Domaine Weinbach in Alsace, 
$25, to accompany one of the fish dishes. The Veuve Clicquot non-vintage brut 
is well-priced $43. For dessert, consider a glass of Muscat de Beaumes de 
Venise from Domaine Durban, $6. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the restaurant and bar-cafe, Vida offers the Chado room, 
reserved for a maximum of eight for an entire evening. You choose the music, 
decor, the menu and the wines. You can dine Japanese style, Western style or 
seated at a low table on antique short-legged Pakistani chairs. From what I 
know of Eric, he's preparing to have some fun with this idea, too. As are the 
customers. I was informed that the room may be reserved for New Year's Eve by a 
couple who requested beds as part of the decor.

ON THE RECORD: DEBUSSY'S CREATIONS, WITH JUST THE RIGHT TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The notion that great music makes its great impression under virtually any 
professional interpretive circumstances must have been propounded before the 
arrival of Debussy's piano works. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever music of immense stature stood or fell on the basis of a performer's 
interpretive intercession, it is Debussy's: at once powerful in all its aspects 
and fragile enough to be shattered by misconception. Not even Chopin's 
similarly non-heroic creations depend for their effect so much on the 
performer's intelligence and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman has always shown a bent for the poetic -- 
the subtly lyric as opposed to the overtly dramatic, as evidenced in his highly 
persuasive playing of Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
 In his stunningly fine new recording of the two books of Debussy Preludes 
(Deutsche Grammophon 435 733, two CDs) he is at once the most analytical of 
pianists and the most imaginative. 
</P>
<P>
 What strikes the listener from the outset is the reflectiveness that Zimerman 
has invested in these performances. Yet they never seem studied. The two books 
emerge of a piece, but there is no single, overriding approach to their 24 
separate components, which puts Zimerman at odds with the locus classicus for 
this music, Walter Gieseking, whose mystical 1950s performances of the Preludes 
are available on a single CD (EMI 61004). 
</P>
<P>
 In Zimerman's hands, the floating pieces -- e.g., "Danseuses de Delphes," "Des 
pas sur la neige," "Les fees sont d'exquises danseuses" -- are as magically 
evocative as one could desire. But they also have rhythmic backbone, as befits 
a pianist who also has strong modernist sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 When the music is more outgoing, as in the "wind" pieces -- "Le vent dans la 
plaine" and "Ce qu'a vu le vent de l'Ouest" -- the playing has the percussive 
edge one expects of a Bartok specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimerman, then, is many pianists -- all probing and accomplished -- in this 
masterly set of performances. The only fault is economical: 84 minutes of 
playing time are spread across two full-priced CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Zimerman, Maurizio Pollini sounds the modernist in everything he does: 
clear-eyed, analytical, rhythm-oriented. So, it's hardly surprising that he 
would gravitate to the most hard-edged of Debussy's piano works, his dozen 
"Etudes," or that he delivers them with characteristic clarity and control 
(Deutsche Grammophon 423 678). 
</P>
<P>
 But there is fantasy and humor in this music, too, which Pollini's tense 
playing, even in such whimsies as "Pour les tierces" and "Pour les agrements," 
fails to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting how little difference there is between Pollini's approach to 
Debussy and to the fillup, Alban Berg's thorny Sonata. But perhaps he's making 
a point about stylistic similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 A tantalizing whiff of what's missing from Pollini's "Etudes" is offered by 
the young English pianist Joanna MacGregor in the half-dozen she offers as part 
of an altogether brilliant and satisfying recital that also includes Bartok's 
Bulgarian Dances and "Out of Doors" plus a Ravel group (Collins 14042). 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this program, and especially in the Debussy, MacGregor exhibits a 
degree of fantasy, of dynamic and rhythmic daring that project the composer's 
modernism more potently than Pollini's single-mindedly tough approach. 
</P>
<P>
 MacGregor would seem to be an artist, not merely a pianist, to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearly complete set of Debussy's music for one and two pianos, with only 
some juvenilia missing, comes in a pair of Philips' budget-priced "Duo" sets 
(438 718, 438 721, two CDs each). 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist is Werner Haas (1931-76), whose splendid Ravel interpretations are 
likewise available in the Duo series. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas attended Gieseking's master classes, but if there was any influence, it 
isn't evidenced in the younger artist's Debussy, recorded in the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haas sets are valuable and, obviously, a good buy. But the playing is on 
the plain side, perhaps too intent on distancing itself from the 
then-pervasive, mannered Gieseking style.

JAZZ SPOTLIGHT; **** KEITH JARRETT, "AT THE DEER HEAD INN"; ECM  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This album, despite Jarrett's sometimes annoying, sometimes humorous humming, 
is a compendium of grace. Recorded live at a small inn in Delaware Water Gap, 
Pa., where the pianist played as teen-ager, these selections are consistently 
engaging, offering a series of scintillating moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrett's trio -- including bassist Gary Peacock and old sidekick Paul Motian 
in for regular drummer Jack DeJohnette -- investigates another bouquet of 
standards, and in the leader's singular style, where swing is ever-present but 
stated subtly. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, as on Miles Davis' "Solar," he'll explore a tune's harmonic and melodic 
structure literally, then stray away from it, like someone going for a hike and 
sticking mostly to the path, but taking now-and-then excursions from that 
trail. This approach keeps the listener on his toes, ever alert for the next 
shift in direction, the next compelling idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaki Byard's blues "Chandra" shows that Jarrett has be-bop deep in his heart, 
dropping in one crisp figure after another, while the poignant "You Don't Know 
What Love Is," after a tender solo, finds the pianist moving into a lengthy, 
intriguing one-chord vamp that recalls his unaccompanied improvisations. "Bye 
Bye Blackbird" is fluidity exemplified, as the leader works with the luxurious 
litheness of one of his favorite pianists, Wynton Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent). ZAN STEWART

 The band powers out a new slew of terroristic lyrics over its own blend of 
fat, confident power chords.Singer Selene Vigil seethes on lines like "Can I 
bounce a rock off your head? / Can I pronounce you dead?" in a cold, 
kick-you-when-you're-down tone, then saunters along the emotional edge of Patti 
Smith-inspired mania. She expels lyrics in ornery packs, occasionally letting 
loose roars that would send Pantera running for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-fi tunes walk by cool and slow, only picking up speed for an occasional 
punk-rock number. Deep bass lines come off as enigmatic, then as menacing, 
making the tunes stick in the subconscious, while a jagged, buzzing guitar 
lends a rough edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The best moment on this album comes in the song "M.I.A.," its title referring 
to Mia Zapata of the band the Gits, who was raped and murdered last year. Vigil 
sings, "Does society have justice for you? / Well if not, then I do."

SUMMER ALBUM ROUNDUP; ** SPIN DOCTORS, "TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN"; EPIC

 Suggested warning label: "Not to Be Listened to While Not Under the Influence 
of Weed." Nowhere else has the harmonic convergence between vintage lame-hippie 
rock and "alternative" Gen X riffing been so obvious as in the Spinsters' short 
oeuvre , of which this is the second studio album.The Woodstock vibe got buried 
in the pet semetary and came back as . . . twentysomething goofballs parlaying 
the pleasant major-key guitars of Deadhead-ism and Steve Miller's lazy-pop 
sensibilities into modern multiplatinum success? (The dream is alive.) 
</P>
<P>
 In some circles, the shock of the old passing for new is cause for 
consternation. And certainly it's easy to listen to a pot-headed song like 
"More Than Meets the Ear" ("Stars and planets in the sky / Each of these are 
singing tunes / And listening are autumn moons / And in these tunes are more 
than meets the ear") and fear for the future of the republic. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the album is as inoffensive as it is unexciting -- a serviceable, 
low-key, jam-happy party record whose overwhelming good nature provides a minor 
tonic for all the garment-rending anguished-teen competition. At least there's 
a strong band identity happening here, if misguidedly sober inspection turns up 
even less than meets the ear.

SUMMER ALBUM ROUNDUP; *** SUICIDAL TENDENCIES, "SUICIDAL FOR LIFE"; EPIC  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suicidal Tendencies may be the great forgotten band of the "alternative" 
revolution, the riff- heavy indie-punk crossover success that these days is 
supposed to have started with Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 This one may be less ambitious than their last three albums, one of which was 
a call to youth revolution, the next displaying an almost Lennon-esque naked 
emotional vulnerability, the last an almost note-for-note reworking of the 
band's decade-old indie-label debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Suicidal has always possessed a lot of the same virtues critics adore in U2 
and Pearl Jam but find insufferable in what they see as a skate-metal band. 
It's probably something very like a class thing -- nobody wants to hear about 
dysfunctional parenting from a singer who, like Suicidal's Mike Muir, comes off 
as a hardened worst-case scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Suicidal for Life" is, one suspects, more what Suicidal's new, 
less-marginalized audience expects from the band: full-on, sort of relentless, 
just close enough to generic speed metal to snare the Pantera-heads yet blown 
out of punk-rock fury. It's also seriously anthemic, though the shout-along 
choruses tend to be a tad more, um, simplistic than one might prefer. Still, if 
you have an ounce of aggression in your soul, this might be the -- Saturday 
night car tape of your dreams.

THE DISCS OF SUMMER; SUMMER ALBUM ROUNDUP; *** ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, 
"ZINGALAMADUNI"; CHRYSALIS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re-creating the debut album's mixture of Afrocentric celebration, topical 
homilies, anti-gangsta disses and personal, spiritual lamentations, 
"Zingalamaduni" -- that's Swahili for "beehive culture" -- lives up to its name 
in giving good, communal buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leader Speech sometimes lives a little too well up to his name 
too.Early on, preachments take priority over personal asides, as Speech 
catalogues social concerns to the point that his well-meant raps start to sound 
like grocery lists of urban woes and power-to-the-people slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually he does get more intimate and -- inevitably -- more interesting. 
"Ache'n for Acres" makes a case for pride in property ownership. In "Warm 
Sentiments," Speech gets on his girlfriend's case for having an abortion 
without consulting him. With the closing "Ease My Mind" and "Praisin' U," he 
further retreats from Daisy Age group exhortations to the God-sized-hole of 
Angst that made "Tennessee" such a classic, if the results here aren't quite as 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 tracks again effectively combine comparatively light sampling and spare 
live playing, with emphasis given to Speech's nasal rap and the troupe's 
trademark female wails. No major developments, but the Pan-African pleasures in 
A.D.'s feel-good hip-hop niche haven't been at all arrested.

SUMMER ALBUM ROUNDUP; ** BOSTON, "WALK ON"; MCA  
</P>

<P>
By MIKE BOEHM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given the never-ending swell of pomp and glory that marks Boston's first album 
in eight years, you would think mastermind Tom Scholz had returned from 
conquering Gaul rather than from a long campaign of studio overdubbing. 
Punk-bred rawness and anger may prevail now in the marketplace, but this Caesar 
of corporate rock hasn't changed his concept a lick. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston sticks with the gleaming, overstuffed, prog-rock-meets-pop-metal sound 
that launched it to three multiplatinum albums in the 1970s and '80s. On 
virtually every track, Scholz's love of majesty sends massed voices and guitars 
soaring into orbit in the rock equivalent of a 21-gun salute. The bombast 
supports sugared melodies that flag down the album's home stretch, but tracks 
like "Walk On," "Surrender to Me" and "I Need Your Love" have the sing-along 
quality of past Boston hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Recording is said to have taken three years, but the hyper-romantic lyrics 
sound as if they were slapped together over three beers. Any band that rhymes 
"point of no return" with "watch the bridges burn" clearly isn't looking for 
new illuminations. But, for a commercial juggernaut like Boston, that is almost 
beside the point. Scholz is selling reassuring, familiar, triumphant music for 
listeners tossed by worried times.

SUMMER ALBUM ROUNDUP; *** JOAN JETT & THE BLACKHEARTS, "PURE AND SIMPLE"; 
WARNER BROS.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ROSENBLUTH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plain and simple is more like it, for Jett's music is anything but pure. Here, 
almost exactly as on her previous solo outings, she jumbles together a panoply 
of influences ranging from doo-wop to moptops, with particularly heaping 
measures of late-'70s punk and mid-'60s bubblegum. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes "Pure and Simple" so gratifying has little to do with any climactic 
evolution in Jett's sound, though the collaborations with hit songwriters 
Desmond Child and Jim Vallance meld melody with muscle more seamlessly than she 
ever has before. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the record's contemporary punch stems from the current underground 
celebrity of riot grrrls and their more mainstream ilk. Coming from someone 
else, Jett's paean to this nascent movement, "Activity Grrrl," and recruiting 
members of Bikini Kill, L7 and Babes in Toyland to write and sing with her 
might smack of bandwagon-ism. But as a pubescent, leather-clad guitarist of the 
infamous Runaways back in the mid-'70s, Jett practically invented the genre -- 
or at least the attitude that fuels it. 
</P>
<P>
 True fans will want the album, CD and tape because each varies slightly, with 
the LP version -- natch -- including an extra pair of all-out rockers.

songstress inhabits a world without rap, Nirvana or even, apparently, a 
radio.But the considerable influence she has had on others -- Tori Amos springs 
to mind -- can be heard on such tuneful, archetypal Nicks songs as "Blue 
Denim." The utterly soulless version of "Just Like a Woman" is none the less 
regrettable for the guitar and harmonica playing on it of its creator, Bob 
Dylan.

 Still the World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones may have to relinquish that title -- at least when it comes 
to selling concert tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Stones came to town, in 1989, the band sold out four shows 
at the 75,000-capacity Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as part of the fabulously 
successful "Steel Wheels" tour. 
</P>
<P>
 No such fortune this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stones had planned to do three nights at the 65,000-capacity Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena, starting Oct. 19. But that goal looks doubtful after the sluggish 
sales for just one Stones show there. Instead of the instant sellouts expected 
these days by major attractions, it took several days to sell out the Rose Bowl 
-- even with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an added attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stones are still expected to add one more show, but plans for the third 
have apparently been scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 How could that be? 
</P>
<P>
 Among the theories floated by concert industry insiders: 
</P>
<P>
 * It's economics. People have already spent so much money on Pink Floyd, 
Eagles and Barbra Streisand shows that they are reluctant to dip into their 
wallets again. And it's not just the Rose Bowl -- the Stones' sales have been 
under "Steel Wheels" levels in many markets around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just so much money to go around -- and the Stones came into the game 
late," one national concert promoter said. "If the Stones had come out first, 
it might have been a whole different story. Still, it's surprising . . . 
because you thought the Stones were, well, the Stones. " 
</P>
<P>
 * It's timing. By putting the Rose Bowl date on sale five months before the 
show -- and before the release of the band's upcoming new album "Voodoo Lounge" 
-- there was no new music on the radio to stir excitement. It's no coincidence 
that the second Rose Bowl show is not expected to go on sale until after the 
album's release on July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music is how you pick up new fans," says Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the 
concert business trade magazine Pollstar. "If the record comes out and it gets 
lots of airplay, you'll see a lot of interest in the shows." 
</P>
<P>
 * It's over. Could it be that the Stones simply aren't the draw they used to 
be? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll soon see," said one industry observer. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of people apparently counting on the Stones' coming through in the 
end are the area ticket brokers. A Pop Eye survey of brokers, who demand 
whatever the market will bear for tickets, found top seats ($50 face value) 
being sold for as much as $650. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the brokers also report that they still have plenty of Stones 
tickets on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 BEATLES BATTLE: It's no secret that there was bad blood between John Lennon 
and Paul McCartney after the Beatles broke up. The feuding was frequently quite 
public. Remember Lennon's vitriolic song attacking McCartney, "How Do You 
Sleep?" 
</P>
<P>
 But there was also apparently a private war of words. A handwritten draft of a 
nasty letter from Lennon to McCartney and his wife, Linda, has turned up and it 
can be yours . . . for $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the price being asked by Gary Zimet, a New York-based rare documents 
dealer who recently acquired the six-page letter from a friend of the late 
Beatle. Undated but apparently written around the time of the band's 1970 
split, the missive lays into Paul -- and, perhaps more so, Linda -- for their 
posturing about the demise of the band. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul and (manager Allen) Klein both spent the day persuading me it was better 
not to say anything (about my leaving the Beatles) because (that) would hurt 
the Beatles. . . . Remember? So get that into your petty little perversion of a 
mind, Mrs. McCartney. (The other Beatle wives) asked me to keep quiet about it. 
Of course the money angle is important to all of us, especially after all the 
petty (expletive) that came from your insane family/in-laws. And God help you 
out, Paul." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A.-based rock memorabilia collector and dealer Jeff Leve says the letter 
sounds like a "substantial" entry in the Beatles documents catalogue. But he 
says he doubts that Zimet will get even close to his asking price. Such prized 
items as the handwritten lyrics of "A Day in the Life," he notes, sold for 
considerably less than that.  
</P>
<P>
 And one more thing, he says: The biggest and wealthiest individual collector 
of Beatles items these days is not likely to want the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Leve, the collector's name is Paul McCartney. 
</P>
<P>
 BLOCKBUSTER BLOCKAGE: The Eagles' reunion show at the Glen Helen Blockbuster 
Pavilion June 3 was also the first run for the venue's expanded capacity to 
35,000 -- double the previous capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did it go? 
</P>
<P>
 Not well, according to some Eagles fans and some in the Eagles camp. There was 
grumbling about long waits at the food concessions, souvenir booths and 
restrooms, and up to a two-hour traffic jam after the show ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just totally unprepared for that many people," says Peter Lopez, the 
Eagles' attorney. "I talked to a lot of people who felt the lines and the 
parking were intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Blockbuster Pavilion acknowledges that the lines were bad 
at times, but pledged extra restrooms will be added for future shows as needed. 
As for the parking lot situation, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol 
in San Bernardino says that it was no worse than for any large event. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be several opportunities soon for pop fans to judge for themselves, 
as upcoming concerts by Metallica, Steely Dan and Janet Jackson all are 
expected to approach that 35,000 capacity. The real test, though, will be next 
year, with plans to raise the number to 50,000 or more -- though a new freeway 
exit system will be in place by then to help the traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 THE HOLE STORY: Courtney Love's appearance in the audience at the MTV Movie 
Awards show last week -- accompanied by R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe -- added fuel to 
rumors that she's preparing to take her band, Hole, on tour. A planned series 
of dates was put on indefinite hold in April after the suicide of her husband, 
Kurt Cobain.  
</P>

 A source close to Hole, though, says the tour is still on hold, but that the 
band definitely will do shows once Love is "emotionally ready." No prediction 
was made as to when that would be. Steve Hochman

POP MUSIC CHARTS: GREAT 'COMMUNICATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 E verybody loves the Beastie Boys. It's rare that one album, the group's new 
"Ill Communication," makes such a splash in the mainstream and in so many 
tributaries. The album by the white rap outfit not only debuted at No. 1 on 
both The Times' Southern California and national pop charts, but -- and get 
this -- it also entered at the top of the R&B, rap and hard-rock charts -- also 
both in this region and nationally. The only major chart it didn't score on 
was, naturally, country. A truly remarkable chart performance.

 After taking much of the past year off, Mary J. Blige is back at work on the 
follow-up to her hit 1992 debut album. A source at Uptown Records, which 
releases her work, denies a rumor that Blige had completed an album that the 
company rejected. For the new one, due around the end of the year, Blige is 
doing more of the songwriting than on her debut. . . .

 Basketball star Shaquille O'Neal's team, the Orlando Magic, got eliminated 
from the playoffs weeks ago -- so why isn't he back working on his other career 
as a rapper? He's returned to college at Louisiana State University to finish 
up his undergraduate degree, but he's planning to spend July and August working 
on a follow-up to his million-selling debut, "Shaq Diesel." . . .

 Crosby, Stills & Nash are finishing a new album, due Aug. 16, while David 
Crosby is also working on a solo album, due later in the year. Perhaps in 
answer to his first solo album, 1971's "If I Could Only Remember My Name," the 
now-sober Crosby is calling his new one "It's All Coming Back to Me Now." . . .

 If you're a fan of the new "Robocop" TV series, you may know that the theme,

shoot a video for the song, which will also be released as a "limited edition" 
CD single later this summer. . . .

 Jose Ferrer (pictured) is superb as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, the cruelly 
crippled aristocrat who sought solace from pain and loneliness in liquor and 
immortalized the gaudy lowlife of Belle Epoque Montmartre in his posters and 
paintings. To get the look of the artist's work in this 1952 landmark film, 
director John Huston and cinematographer Oswald Morris consulted Life 
photographer Eliot Elisofon, and the result is one of the most beautiful and 
poignant of all color films. With Colette Marchand, Suzanne Flon and Zsa Zsa 
Gabor (TNT Thursday at 5 p.m.).

CRITICS' PICKS: 'DAVE'

<P>
By Kenneth Turan

<TEXT>
<P>
 The premise of this light-on-its-feet political satire, written by Gary Ross 
and directed by Ivan Reitman, is that William Harrison Mitchell, the humorless, 
ruthless, philandering President of the United States, has a double, Dave 
Kovic, the hang-loose owner of a temporary employment agency who wears funny 
ties and isn't averse to riding a pig if the situation demands it. Recruited 
for a one-night stand by the Secret Service, Dave's gig unexpectedly turns out 
to be a longer engagement. Sigourney Weaver plays the understandably suspicious 
First Lady to Kevin Kline's President in what is the best kind of comedy -- one 
whose jokes can't be given away (HBO Tuesday at 9 a.m., Friday at 11 a.m.).

 Steven Starr's 1993 debut feature is a jaunty little movie that's full of 
surprises.Richard Edson has the title role as a brash Manhattan-based talent 
agent near the top of a profession he clearly loves, a man who seems content 
when a series of events affect his life more than he -- or we -- at first 
realize. There are a couple of flaws typical of a first film: There's too much 
trade talk in its first third, and Joey's entire odyssey could have been more 
fully developed and contained a bit of foreshadowing. Nevertheless, it 
possesses a welcome and engaging substance along with its humor (Cinemax 
Thursday at 5:40 a.m.). Kevin Thomas

 If recreational sex these days is a battlefield, then Rebecca De Mornay and 
Don Johnson, the stars of this 1993 movie, come off as couple of erotic 
samurai.Playing a hotshot female defense attorney and her randy client, an 
accused wife-killer, these two use sexiness as a weapon: ripping each other 
with a glance, thrusting with an innuendo, parrying with a smile. Directed by 
Sidney Lumet in his coolest, smoothest style, this is an erotic thriller of 
some bloody accomplishment and some flaws, but it's also funny. And the humor 
turns precisely on the easy grace and playfulness with which these actors, 
public sex objects of long standing, manipulate their on-screen allure 
(Showtime Friday at 8 p.m.). Michael Wilmington

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; THE PAST IS STILL PART OF KATHLEEN SULLIVAN'S PRESENT -- 
WELL, LET HER EXPLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Calendar.

 Kathleen Sullivan sounds hoarse and congested. "Too many airplanes," says the 
former sweater-clad Olympics sportscaster and current spokeswoman for Weight 
Watchers. "I've just been moving around too much," she says from the Palm 
Springs airport en route to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan's travels now take her back to her first prime-time anchoring stint 
in four years: On Tuesday she will host NBC's "After the Headlines ..." The 
program looks at what happened to several people who became instant newsmakers 
-- only to see that fame disappear soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers are trying to keep secret some of the "instant stars" profiled, 
but one is Mary Beth Whitehead, surrogate mom to Baby M. The show is done 
"Rescue 911"-style, using file footage to reacquaint viewers with the original 
stories, followed by interviews with those whose lives had been so dramatically 
affected by them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, who describes hers as "the William Shatner role," does not do the 
interviews but serves only as host. Still, the controversial Sullivan, now 40, 
ackowledges she was an obvious choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, I was there for many of those stories, covering them and 
discussing them on the air," she says. "Secondly, I'd worked with (executive 
producer) Susan Winston on 'Good Morning America.' And, finally, I'm having my 
second 15 minutes of fame right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan laughs with little bitterness about the fact that she burst onto the 
news scene at CNN, then moved to ABC, and finally to CBS where she co-anchored 
"CBS This Morning." There she was fired in a highly publicized fall from grace, 
replete with rumors about her frisky night life and comments about her wildly 
fluctuating weight. So she can relate to many of the people interviewed on this 
program and only hope she is handling the post-fame syndrome half as well as 
they have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen interviews so compelling as these," she says, "and one reason 
is the interviews are not antagonistic. No one's judging or blaming. All these 
people -- whose moments of fame occurred between 7 and 24 years ago -- come to 
the table with real wisdom. They're not bitter and I don't think the word media 
comes up one time. This show is about light, not heat, and we can all learn 
some lessons." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan's first response to the question, "Is there anything bad with falling 
out of the spotlight?" is "no." On second thought, she adds, "What's hard is 
when people still write about you and forget you're a human being. Too much has 
been written about me that was mean-spirited and false." 
</P>
<P>
 She has no regrets about her route back into the spotlight, as spokeswoman for 
Superstart, a weight-loss program from Weight Watchers. "It's really a lot of 
fun," says Sullivan, who plans to fulfill her two-year contract. "I also feel 
really great with the fat off me and I'm just on maintenance now, though I'm a 
lifer in the organization. And the job has helped bring me back at a time when 
I needed the exposure. Research has shown that there are a lot of people under 
the age of 25 who had no idea who I was before this. Well, now they know." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the next 15 minutes, Sullivan says she's working on a development deal 
with one network and remains active with women's golf activities. "I want to do 
quality stuff like this show," she says. "I don't want to bluff and I don't 
want the daily grind of a regular show. I've been around long enough to know 
that you grab the good moments and you live with the bad ones until they pass." 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Headlines ... " airs at 8 p.m. on NBC.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A PRINCELY NEW TROCADERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as May turned to June, a new supper club debuted on Sunset Boulevard in 
West Hollywood. The opening was remarkably quiet, considering that one of the 
investors is -- you know -- the symbol, the megastar who used to be called 
Prince. His art director, Cliff Cunningham, designed the restaurant, and it's 
less flashy than you'd imagine, a demure Art Deco vision of burnished walls and 
stenciled borders with two tiny enclosed patios. To evoke the glamour of old 
Hollywood, co-owner Bambi Byrens borrowed the name of the legendary Cafe 
Trocadero, a fixture on Sunset in the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 She found a cache of photos of the original club and its star-studded 
clientele at a photo archive. Here, framed on the wall, is a young George Burns 
with Gracie forever at his side, a dapper Robert Cummings and the dreamy trio 
of Olivia de Havilland, Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. In the ladies' room, 
a copy of a March 31, 1938, telegram to Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount advises 
the director that since special party decorations for the Apache Ball at the 
Trocadero could not be delivered on time, the club had postponed the ball until 
the next week -- urgent news. 
</P>
<P>
 The chef at the diminutive new Trocadero is Robert Gadsby, who has worked at 
half a dozen local restaurants in the last couple of years, including Xiomara 
and Olive. 
</P>
<P>
 The homage to the original Trocadero stops short at the menu. This one is very 
much of the eclectic here and now: butternut squash soup garnished with a dab 
of spicy mashed potatoes and crisp shrimp dumplings; potato-wrapped Santa 
Barbara spot prawns; grilled swordfish with dill-scented Yukon gold mashed 
potatoes, bitter greens and potato gnocchi; peppered summer berries with ginger 
and white chocolate ice cream. Vegetarians get a special bento box, described 
as a postmodern tower of vegetarian delights. 
</P>
<P>
 Trocadero plans to be open late, serving the full menu until a wide-awake 2 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trocadero Restaurant, 8280 W. Sunset Blvd. (at Sweetzer), West Hollywood, 
(213) 656-7161. Open Monday to Friday for lunch, daily for dinner (until 2 
a.m.). Valet parking dinner only. All major credit cards. Appetizers, $5-$8; 
entrees, $12-$15. S. IRENE VIRBILA

RESTAURANT NEWS: CASUAL AND CHEAP CATCHING ON

 Even in this economy, people still go out to eat. They're just spending less 
and demanding more. Savvy Southern California restaurateurs have finally caught 
on and are opening -- or changing -- establishments to suit newer, leaner 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old Beverly Hills the Bistro, which closed in January, was serious 
and expensive. Now the Bistro's owner Kurt Niklas is opening two new places 
that will both be casual and cheaper. Souffle Bistro next door to Dive! in 
Century City is set to open in July, and will feature souffles in the $3 range. 
And in August, Niklas will launch BG's to Go, a small outdoor dining spot with 
takeout adjoining his more formal Bistro Garden in Studio City. "We plan to 
offer bistro favorites plus a few specials at lunch with prices ranging from $5 
to $10 tops," says manager Freddy Kernbach. "We want to appeal to the average 
husband and wife who work and might decide, 'Gee, let's stop at BG's and get a 
decent meal without dressing up and going out to dinner.' "  
</P>
<P>
 The fat has been cut from the food as well as the prices at Gratis, a 
7-week-old Brentwood restaurant and takeout featuring nonfat cuisine under $8. 
Chef Richard Leveckis' eclectic menu features pizzas, salads, soups and 
vegetable-based entrees, even fat-free triple-layer chocolate cake. The 
restaurant boasts that Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and "Star 
Search" host/Publishers Clearing House pitchman Ed McMahon have all been in to 
gorge on the fat-free fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal CityWalk attracts 8 million visitors per year. That's a considerable 
amount of foot traffic, so it's no surprise that two more restaurants have 
signed on to take advantage of all those tourist dollars. BB King's Blues Club 
& Restaurant, a spinoff of the musician's Memphis locale, will open next month. 
Located on the second level, the place will feature what management calls 
"Delta-style food in an intimate urban blues district setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Layne Wootten, who was private chef to the country band Alabama, will design 
the menu for Country Star Restaurant, slated to open at CityWalk in August. 
"Layne won the Pasadena chili cook-off last weekend," says a spokesman for the 
restaurant, "and he makes wonderful rattlesnake chicken, too." The 
14,000-square-foot space will have a Boot Walk of Fame, 62 large screen 
monitors, plus interactive kiosks where customers can push a button and read 
about their favorite country singers. Fans will also be able to pick up 
T-shirts, cassettes and CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignore the name and concentrate on the menu at this new Beverly Hills 
restaurant/cafe. Located in the Rodeo Collection in the former Pastel space, 
California Sun Dried Tomato Restaurant features Caesar salad, rack of lamb, 
roast chicken and the house special . . . sun-dried tomato dip. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lourie, longtime manager of Ye Olde King's Head in Santa Monica, has just 
launched his own watering hole in Playa del Rey. Along with 30 bottled beers 
and 16 more on tap, Captain Billy's also offers a slew of worldly dishes such 
as chicken vindaloo pizza, spanakopita, chicken parmigiana and the captain's 
own fish and chips.  
</P>
<P>
 India's Tandoori has opened in West Los Angeles. The Indian mini-chain 
features an all-you-can-eat $6.95 lunch buffet daily. . . . Meanwhile in 
Woodland Hills, the new Khara Indian Oven offers a $4.95 lunch buffet. . . . A 
third Jody Maroni's Sausage Kingdom stand, featuring 14 different gourmet 
sausages as well as burgers, fries and rotisserie chicken, is set to open 
Friday on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade.

 Thirty years ago my husband and I saw "Endless Summer" at the drive-in

 I'm now a grandmother, still don't surf, but can't wait to see "Endless Summer 
II." It is the energy, power and possible danger of the waves, the glorious 
scenery and summer days and the dreams, perseverance and athleticism of the 
surfers that make these movies not just attractive to those who surf. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there is a non-surfer following for "Endless Summer II," just as there 
was for "Endless Summer," and I as one non-surfer will eagerly await seeing 
"Endless Summer III."

 The moment I began reading your article about Kurt Cobain's life being pitched 
as a movie of the week (Pop Eye, May 22), I started crying.  
</P>
<P>
 In response to Jim Hiett, who proposed the idea to NBC: No, not every 15- to 
30-year-old would serve as audience for this cheap scheme. What is it about 
America that just screams exploitation nowadays? It got sick with the Amy 
Fisher thing, grew worse with Nancy and Tonya, then the Menendez brothers, now 
Kurt Cobain. That is the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 Does something about Kurt, of all people, just even whisper to you "hands 
off," that maybe it's time for the media to leave him alone, once and for all? 
</P>
<P>
 America, Hollywood is getting sicker and sicker in its desperation to turn a 
cheap buck. Maybe it's time to relearn the word respect . Say it after me, 
boys, r-e-s-p-e-c-t spells respect . Get a dictionary. Maybe it's just time for 
me to move the hell away from America. You make me want to vomit.

 What wonderful thoughtful letters from members of Generation X (May 8). I was 
most impressed with their astute comments on Hollywood's failed attempts to 
lure them to the movies with inept portrayals of their lifestyle. They have 
exposed the industry's total focus on possible profitability rather than 
producing quality films. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we must have films for the little kiddies, hopefully interesting enough 
to keep their required chaperons from fracturing their jaws yawning; and the 
next age group needs lots of action and animals to keep their limited attention 
spans in gear. 
</P>
<P>
 But these children become adults, and like the Generation X adults, will want 
what all adults want: films not geared to the 13-year-old mentality that 
Hollywood has claimed for years is the norm for moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
 Generation X might well lead the public clamor for better films. They are 
certainly capable of it! For starters, your May 8 page of letters should be 
required reading for studio heads and producers.

THE SCREEN TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your Film Clips item "A Killer Script From San Quentin," by David J. 
Fox (May 29): 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 170 screenplays submitted for competition to the Writers Workshop in 
1993, only seven were awarded showcase presentations. Of those seven, only two 
were deemed of sufficient quality to be circulated to the studios. San Quentin 
inmate Kenneth Gay was one of the two writers. 
</P>
<P>
 I was the other. 
</P>
<P>
 My winning screenplay, "Killing Time," is about a murderer but was written by 
someone with no criminal record and who would find it very difficult to load a 
rifle to hunt game. I am a simple, decent citizen who pays taxes, votes, works 
full time and tends to my family. In my spare time I write movies. 
</P>
<P>
 To date my telephone has not rung, no one has requested an interview, nor has 
my photo appeared in Calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand life is unfair, particularly life in Hollywood, but this is the 
second time Calendar has covered a Writers Workshop screenwriter with a 
criminal record. The first was J. B. Mackey; he had two articles written about 
him in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that being a blue-collar worker in the trucking industry with no 
formal education in screenwriting is not as far removed from Hollywood as 
making license plates in prison and therefore is not enough of a "hook" for 
Calendar to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess my struggles and sacrifices and the odds I've beaten (168 other 
screenwriters) are just too boring for the media. But I can live with that. 
Because I can still write exciting movies without having a criminal record or 
taking a human life.

 Thanks for printing the latest chapter of "Insight Into the Hollywood Ego 
(Gone Rampant)." Except this one, owned by flavor-of-the-month Robin Swicord, 
really gave new meaning to the term self-aggrandizement ("Here's a Screenwriter 
Who Strives to Give Women a Real Voice," by Vera Dika, Film Clips, May 29). 
</P>
<P>
 I'll be the first to admit that parity in the fair representation of the sexes 
in the film and TV industry is not completely there yet. But to listen to 
Swicord, you'd think she were the first one to come along with the desire and 
ability (not to mention, razor-sharp insight) to represent modern women 
realistically and fairly in the film medium. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an insult to other female writers and directors in this industry -- 
from Martha Coolidge to Nora Ephron to Jane Campion -- who, viewed together, 
have already produced an impressive body of work to date, that if nothing else 
certainly succeeds in giving voice to several modern women's points of view. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing segment of the article, a final quote appears that pretty much 
seems to typify the condescending attitude Swicord maintains throughout the 
piece. She proudly states: "That is what I'm after. It is time to say, of 
course, women are enjoyable to look at, but we also have voices, desires and an 
inner life." 
</P>
<P>
 I'd have to say that on the scale of pseudo-profundity, that one's gotta rate 
a resounding duhhhhh! Ya know, Robin, I never even dreamed.

DIET PROGRAMS FOCUS ON THE WRONG THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jenny Craig's dismal balance sheet ("Jenny Craig Takes a Pounding," May 22) 
brings with it good news that more and more people are realizing that there are 
far better ways to slim down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jenny Craig program and others like it fail because they focus on the 
wrong thing.They restrict calories and quantities, leading to a sense of 
deprivation. The result is a powerful tendency to binge. To make matters worse, 
the resultant slowed metabolism sabotages future efforts to maintain or lose 
weight. Ironically, these programs do not restrict fat intake nearly enough to 
guarantee health or weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 A much better way to lose weight and to keep it off is to forget about how 
much you eat and focus instead on what you eat. Complex carbohydrates from 
pasta, rice, beans and vegetables speed metabolism. The enemy is the fat in 
meats, dairy products and fried foods, which goes straight to the thighs and 
hips. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 20% of the calories on the Jenny Craig program come from fat. A diet 
based on beans, grains, fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, contributes 
only 10% of its calories in the form of fat, representing a far more sensible 
approach to weight loss, and one that can be sustained over the longer term. 
</P>
<P>
 The best approach is a low-fat vegetarian diet. It gives people the power to 
tackle weight problems on their own, enabling them to get on with life as they 
lose weight, rather than just lose money and hope.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: WAKING UP WITH AN ELECTION HANGOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robin Abcarian 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you ever left a voting booth and immediately forgotten how you voted? 
</P>
<P>
 Or is it just me? 
</P>
<P>
 Very few of last week's races have stayed with me. I vaguely remember voting 
for Kathleen Brown for governor. And something sticks in my mind about Delaine 
Eastin for superintendent of public instruction. But there was no race that 
inspired true passion, and in the absence of passion, peculiar logic may 
flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 I voted for Democrat Tony Miller, for example, the acting secretary of state 
who wanted to keep the job, because he is gay. It's high time we had an openly 
gay state official. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state, a job that seems to involve predicting how few people 
will vote, is not a post with a great deal of ideological impact, so Miller's 
political orientation really didn't matter to me. (Ordinarily, I might have 
voted for Michael Woo, except that I am still miffed at him for losing his last 
election and don't feel that statewide office should be his consolation prize.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Miller loses in November, Democrat Sheila James Kuehl, who is also 
gay, is likely to win a spot in the Assembly from the 41st District, which 
includes Woodland Hills, Calabasas, Pacific Palisades and Santa Monica. 
Unfortunately, I don't live in the 41st, so I could send her only a check and 
my best wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 (And no, in case you were wondering, I don't think it's the least bit 
patronizing that a newspaper headline characterized her as an "ex-actress" 
instead of a "feminist attorney." Given the lowest common denominator approach 
to democracy, it is probably true that more people would recognize her as the 
former Zelda Gilroy from "Dobie Gillis" than as the former managing director of 
the California Women's Law Center.) 
</P>
<P>
 As for the propositions, all I know for sure is that I voted in favor of the 
ballot initiative that would stop TV news from showing any more pictures of 
that hideous flesh-eating bacteria that has invaded our shores. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, I was on the losing side. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Election returns are not inherently funny, but I found myself smiling at the 
pseudo-serious tone adopted by newscasters Tuesday night, especially when they 
cluck-clucked over our low voter turnout. They noted that mere weeks ago, newly 
enfranchised blacks in South Africa spent hours in line waiting to exercise 
their hard-won right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 What the anchor people wanted to say was: What's wrong with you people, 
anyhow?  
</P>
<P>
 The question, anchor people, is what's wrong with you?  
</P>
<P>
 The electorate needs to be encouraged to discharge its civic duty. People need 
to be shown why they have a stake in the system they so dearly love to trash. 
Television news, which has the unique ability to infuse mundane politics with 
drama, spits in the face of that obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the night before the primary, the top of 11 o'clock news featured 
the by-now-ubiquitous flesh-chomping bacteria and some unspeakably intrusive 
footage of the young Marine in Oceanside who had just lost his four sons and 
brother to a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a word about the election in the top of the news. Nauseated from both 
stories, I changed channels -- just in time to see the devastated father at the 
top of another station's broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was served by that? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I must have repressed what happened in the voting booth because I did 
something I'm ashamed of.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm pretty sure I voted yes, as is my custom, on anything with the word school 
in it. Yes, also, on anything involving parkland acquisition and access 
improvements for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think I had some kind of liberal neuron blowout when it came to the 
renters' income tax credit. My bleeding heart suddenly imploded, replaced by a 
shrunken raisin of fiscal responsibility. I voted no. 
</P>
<P>
 And believe me, I don't feel too good about that. 
</P>
<P>
 But hey, at least I voted. Which is more than you can say for the 9.5 million 
registered Californians who didn't. How many are renters who might have turned 
the tide in their favor? 
</P>
<P>
 I can't imagine not voting -- for two important reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I passionately believe that voting is the truest and highest expression 
of democracy and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, blackmail. Twice in the last several years I have rushed to my polling 
place moments before closing. Both times, poll workers told me that they were 
waiting for me and would never have believed another word I'd written about 
politics if I hadn't shown up. One man threatened to send a letter to my editor 
exposing me if I ever missed a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 So you bet I vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if I don't always remember how.

 Was the party a raging success because it was called L.A. Alive! with an 
exclamation point? Maybe. Not likely. Whatever the reason, energy swirled under 
the white tents at Greenacres, the Harold Lloyd Estate in Beverly Hills, now 
home to Ron Burkle. Conversation between women in stunning couture and men in 
elegant black-tie was at best peripatetic. Party-goers darted from item to 
item, signing names on 312 silent auction packages of trips, jewels, mailboxes 
by artists and fine art. As auction chairwoman Joy Fein analyzed it: "People 
delight in a good buy, a good deal. Bargains make them happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling in Awe: Guests arrived at the Greenacres courtyard, strolled through 
the red-tiled underworld of the estate, emerged into gardens en route to the 
big white auction tent. Many had stopped earlier at the bank to withdraw 
precious jewels to match their new finery. After two hours of hors d'ouevres by 
Wolfgang Puck and cocktails and bidding (Susie Barker bought five artists' 
mailboxes, and Kathleen and Tom McCarty bid heartily on multiple items), guests 
meandered down a dirt path (skirts hiked) to dinner in another tent scented 
with lemons by dinner chairwoman Chantal Kilroy. 
</P>
<P>
 A Decidedly Midas Touch: There, they dined, listened to New York cabaret 
entertainer Steve Ross and took Bob Abell's advice to heart and bid generously 
on the live auction -- Donna Sussman $44,000 on the Lexus LS 400, Sally and Bob 
Hunt $12,000 on the Silversea Cruises, Ron Burkle and Bob Egleston $8,000 each 
on Wolfgang Puck's dinner parties for 25, Bill Keck $6,000 on the "Three Tenors 
at Dodger Stadium" evening and Category I seats at the final match of the 1994 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase Mishkin bought the Frank Stella collage, Bob Offenhauser the week in 
Scotland, Sheldon Sloan the opportunity to conduct the National Anthem at the 
Hollywood Bowl, Al Berger the African safari, Ed and Nadine Carson the 
Wimbledon tickets, Shinji Sakai the opportunity to conduct the "Hallelujah 
Chorus" with the Los Angeles Master Chorale, and Ric Kayne and R.E. Waldron 
both won visits to the Wiltshire manor house donated by Christy and Sheldon 
Gordon. Elise Marvin will be fly-fishing at Tikchik Narrows Lodge in Alaska. 
The event raised $596,315 for the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Pretty: Joni Smith, in Bill Blass blue and white, Lynn Brengel in 
Escada white pique and pastel taffeta, Helene Irvin in a black and gold 
bumblebee-like Scaasi, Ann Johnson in Oscar de la Renta black lace, Rosa Maria 
Buccellati in Ferragamo silk, Marybeth Brundage in Carolina Herrera gray silk. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Suave: Music Center President Shelton g. Stanfill in a houndstooth 
silk scarf and paisley enameled studs. 
</P>
<P>
 All Day, All Night: Party chairwoman Fein (husband Jerome vouched for it) 
toiled all year, for the past three weeks 21-hours a day with a dauntless 
committee of 70 including Sandra Ausman, Gail Barrett, Teran Davis, Andrea Van 
de Kamp, Wendy Posner, Dodie Booth, Clarice Ellis and Joni Smith. Nice work. 
Elsewhere on the Social Circuit 
</P>
<P>
 * With his wondrous Louisiana accent ("It's an original"), New York designer 
Geoffrey Beene appeared in linen and brown sandals to thrill an SRO crowd at 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art this week as the Costume Council presented 
him with its first Award of Excellence. Minutes before, the members had been on 
the edges of their chairs and on tiptoe in the aisles watching Beene's fall 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, everyone sipped tea in the Times-Mirror Atrium. Chairwoman Janet Watts 
pointed out the philodendron branches in clear vases and the white damask 
linens and said Beene had specified them for the tea. It was Watts alone, 
however, who hired Gloria Boccato to cater the impeccably perfect heart-shaped 
brownies, pecan bars and crab tea sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 A sophisticated crowd including Donna Wolff and Mary Martin turned folksy to 
ask Beene for his autograph on the programs. Beene confessed his spring 
collection will be inspired by Santa Monica, "where I remember seeing my first 
beach pajamas -- and thinking they were rather sassy and fun." Thinking Beene 
rather sassy and fun: everyone, including Jane Ackerman, who now relinquishes 
the Council presidency to Eva Elkins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Social Service Auxiliary President Jayne Sullivan and Presentation Ball 
Chairwoman Patty Burschinger watched with pride as 12 were presented to 
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles, at the Beverly Wilshire. 
The debutantes: Elizabeth Brewer, Kristin Capalbo, Kathryn Chambers, Denise 
Hamilton, Erin Joyce, Kirsten Larsen, Courtney Lynch, Anna Ortiz, Hilary 
Parrish, Jennifer Rohde, Dorothy Shea and Amy Varni. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alan Rothenberg, chairman and CEO of the World Cup, and John Martens, vice 
president, Neiman Marcus, Beverly Hills, hosted cocktails to meet Bora 
Milutinovic, coach of the U.S. World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 * God bless us. At Merci L'Amerique (Thank You America), Marcia Israel's and 
French Consul General Jean Maurice Ripert's night at the Beverly Hilton in 
remembrance of World War II American soldiers, French chanteuse Line Renaud sat 
at dinner with Gregory and Veronique Peck. 
</P>
<P>
 When Renaud sang, she evoked tears and memories the audience didn't know it 
had tucked away. After "I'll Walk Alone" and "I'll Be Seeing You," she blew a 
kiss with "because of you, the lights of Paris are still bright -- merci 
beaucoup. " 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans remembered the 9,036 left behind at Normandy. And tributes came from 
Art Linkletter, Red Buttons (who introduced himself as "Rouge Baton"), Raoul 
Aglion, Norm Crosby (who served in the Coast Guard in the Atlantic during the 
war), the dancing Savoys and impersonator Gordie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Said comedian Crosby, famous for his malapropisms: "We need nights like this 
to cleanse us of our impunities ." Man-on-the-moon Buzz Aldrin was there with 
his wife, Lois, and Angelenos Walter Grauman and Royce Diener wore their 
Distinguished Flying Crosses.

 The TV Movie: "Amelia Earhart: The Final Flight"; airs at 8 tonight on TNT, 
with repeat showings throughout the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: A biography of aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart (Diane Keaton, 
pictured), whose plane disappeared over the South Pacific in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Jill Ohanneson, whose credits include the feature film 
"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" and the television movies "Citizen Cohn" 
and "Last of His Tribe." She is working on "Unstrung Heroes," a feature film 
directed by Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: This part was positively tailor-made for Keaton, the quirky style 
queen of cinema. With newly cropped hair, she effortlessly slips into the 
Earhart uniform of very loose trousers and jodhpurs, rayon shirts, silk or 
cotton scarves tied in a multitude of jaunty ways (as ascot, necktie, kerchief 
or just looped around the neck), men's oxford lace-up shoes and, of course, a 
leather bomber jacket. Picture this look against a '30s backdrop, when most 
women wore dresses, hats and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit: Notice that toward the end of her life, Earhart favored snappy Western 
clothing such as ranch pants and Western shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss: When the movie begins in 1935, Earhart has abandoned her famous flying 
cap, because the advent of closed cockpits made it unnecessary. Still, it's a 
pity not to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "Much earlier than anyone else, Earhart knew the value of dressing for 
comfort and freedom. She dressed for herself. She would totally fit in today 
and would be very comfortable in this time," Ohanneson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted: "Amelia actually had kind of bad taste when it came to wearing dressy, 
feminine clothes. She looked a little awkward in them. She was so tall -- I 
think 5-foot-10 -- and very, very thin, and with that short hair, frilly 
clothes just didn't work," Ohanneson adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Earhart always wore an elephant hair bracelet (it was in the box of 
goods she shipped home before her last flight), but Keaton favored a '30s 
silver link bracelet from her own collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Research: The Ninety-Nines Inc., a resource center sponsored by female pilots 
around the world, in Oklahoma City, Okla.; Earhart biographies, film footage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: All the clothing is vintage. It was culled from many stores and 
collectors including Private Collection, Palace Costumes, Costume Rentals 
Corp., Mark Fox, American Costumes and Costume Collection in Los Angeles, Ardis 
Taylor in Oakland. BETTY GOODWIN

 1. Is this a good time to buy a house? 
</P>
<P>
 Experts would say yes, if you meet the following criteria: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are not counting on price appreciation in the short term. Most experts 
don't expect home prices to inflate much in Southern California in the next 
couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can afford the monthly payments. Remember, the Southland is one of the most 
expensive housing markets in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Plan to stay in the house long enough for the appreciation to cover your 
transaction costs. The costs of buying and selling a home include real estate 
commissions, lender fees and closing costs that can amount to more than 10% of 
the sales price. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Need a tax break. The mortgage interest deduction can make homeownership 
very appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prefer to be an owner rather than a renter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can handle the maintenance expenses and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Are not greatly concerned by dips in home values. 
</P>
<P>
 2. How do I figure what I can afford to buy? 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly, it's three times your annual income. Real estate experts strongly 
recommend people get pre-qualified by a lender as a way of calculating exactly 
how much of a home they can afford.  
</P>
<P>
 When qualifying people for a loan, lenders look at a borrower's full financial 
standing. Lenders use the relationship between the borrower's projected PITI, 
or principal, interest, taxes and insurance payments, and their gross monthly 
income. Generally, lenders like to see the PITI not exceed 30% to 33% of the 
borrower's gross monthly income. They also consider the ratio of the borrower's 
monthly debt payments, including the PITI, to income. Some lenders have 
flexibility in these qualifying ratios. 
</P>
<P>
 3. What is considered a low down payment? 
</P>
<P>
 Anything less than the standard 20%. However, many people borrow with less 
than 20% down by obtaining private mortgage insurance (PMI). And numerous 
programs are available to help first-time buyers with little or no down 
payment, including Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Veterans 
Administration (VA) and Federal National Mortgage Assn.'s (Fannie Mae) 
Community Home Buyers Program. 
</P>
<P>
 4. How much does PMI cost? 
</P>
<P>
 "PMI costs vary from one mortgage insurance firm to another, but premiums 
usually run about 0.5% of the loan amount for the first year of the loan. Most 
PMI premiums are a bit lower for subsequent years. The first year's mortgage 
insurance premium is usually paid in advance at the close of escrow, and there 
is usually a separate PMI approval process," writes Dian Hymer, author of 
"Buying and Selling a Home in California, A Complete Guide" (Chronicle Books). 
</P>
<P>
 5. Can I drop my PMI? 
</P>
<P>
 California Civil Code 2954.6, a disclosure law, requires lenders to notify 
borrowers within 30 days after the close of escrow whether the borrower has the 
right to cancel private mortgage insurance. The code also requires lenders or 
servicers to provide borrowers with an annual notice concerning each borrower's 
right to terminate PMI. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil Code 2954.7 grants borrowers the right to terminate PMI under certain 
limited circumstances. Generally, to drop PMI, the loan must be at least 2 
years old and the borrower cannot have made any late payments in the last year. 
In addition, the loan-to-value ratio must be less than 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 6. How much should I set aside for maintenance expenses? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bob Vilas, author of "Guide to Buying Your Dream House," (Little, 
Brown & Co.): "For maintenance, depending on the age and condition of the 
house, you should allocate about 1% of the purchase price annually." 
</P>
<P>
 7. Is it better to make as large a down payment as possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Putting down as little as possible and taking a larger mortgage allows buyers 
to take full advantage of the tax benefits of homeownership. Mortgage interest 
(and property taxes) are fully deductible from state and federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other real estate experts say it may be more prudent to make a larger 
down payment and thereby reduce the amount of debt that must be financed. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Can I buy a house with nothing down? 
</P>
<P>
 Although some experts advise against it, home buyers interested in buying a 
house with nothing down can do so. But it's not easy finding these loans and in 
some cases they can be risky. Occasionally, a builder will offer nothing-down 
loans to induce sales in an otherwise slow-moving project. Desperate sellers 
also may agree to finance the full purchase price to get out from under a 
property. The VA loan program allows buyers to qualify for a nothing-down loan, 
as well as a loan program offered through the California Public Employees 
Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 9. What programs does the FHA offer? 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers a variety of 
loan insurance programs through FHA that require about 4% to 5% cash down. The 
down payment must be the buyer's own money -- gift money is not allowed -- but 
buyers can finance all non-recurring closing costs.  
</P>
<P>
 FHA loan limits vary depending on the county where the property is located. 
Recently, the FHA loan limit was increased to $151,725, but only in high cost 
areas such as Los Angeles. FHA loans are originated and serviced by private 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 10. What special programs exist for veterans? 
</P>
<P>
 VA loans are attractive because in some cases they require no down payment. 
With the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, there is no restriction on the 
purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs at (800) 
827-1000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the California Department of Veterans Affairs offers a home loan 
program. Cal-Vet actually buys the subject property from the seller and resells 
the property to the veteran on a land contract. The department holds title 
until the veteran has repaid the amount owed, although the veteran has the 
right to possession of the property as his or her personal residence. 
</P>
<P>
 For specific information about Cal-Vet programs and requirements, call (310) 
944-2366. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Can people who served in the National Guard use the VA loan program? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but the qualifying requirements may be more stringent and loan fees for 
National Guard veterans are generally more costly. 
</P>
<P>
 12. How does the Community Home Buyers Program work? 
</P>
<P>
 The program is sponsored by Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Assn., 
and administered through participating lenders. The program has an income cap 
of 115% of the area's median income. In addition, the borrower must attend a 
seminar on homeownership and the home-buying process.  
</P>
<P>
 The program allows for 95% financing. The borrower may put down as little as 
3% of his or her own money, with the remaining 2% coming in the form of a 
family gift or loan from a government or nonprofit agency.  
</P>
<P>
 For a list of participating lenders, call Fannie Mae at (800) 732-6643. 
</P>
<P>
 13. What are the standard contingencies in a purchase offer? 
</P>
<P>
 According to author Dian Hymer, "Most real estate purchase contracts include 
at least two contingencies. A financing contingency makes the purchase 
conditional on the buyers' ability to obtain a loan commitment from a lender. 
An inspection contingency allows the buyers to have professionals inspect the 
property to their satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 14. Can I get a home loan with bad credit? 
</P>
<P>
 A poor credit history makes it harder to qualify for a mortgage. There are 
numerous types of credit report problems that cause a lender to reject a loan 
application, says Ilyce R. Glink in "100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer 
Should Ask" (Random House): 
</P>
<P>
 "'If you've ever missed a credit card payment, or been late with a credit card 
payment, or defaulted on a prior mortgage or school or car loan, it will 
probably show up on your credit report. If you've filed for bankruptcy within 
the past seven years, that will show up on your credit report. If you haven't 
paid your taxes, or there has been a judgment filed against you (perhaps for 
non-payment of spousal or child support), it will also show up. Failure to pay 
your landlord, doctor or hospital may turn into a black spot on your credit 
report." 
</P>
<P>
 15. How can I find out what my credit report says about me? 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone concerned about their credit history can order a copy of their own 
report by calling the three main national credit reporting agencies: Equifax 
(800) 685-1111; TRW (800) 392-1122, or Trans Union (312) 408-1050. 
</P>
<P>
 16. Can I legally buy a house with a couple of friends or investors? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. The investment approach -- equity sharing -- isn't very popular when 
homes aren't appreciating because investors disappear. However, the "tenants in 
common" (TIC) way of holding title is becoming more popular, especially among 
first-time buyers as a way to purchase property collectively with other 
unrelated individuals. Generally, TIC properties are eligible for many of the 
same loan programs as homes owned by individuals, but the underwriting 
standards are more complicated because the lender must consider the financial 
situation of all the parties who hold an interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
 17. How do lease options help people buy a home? 
</P>
<P>
 According to the "Realty Bluebook, 29th Edition" (Dearborn Financial 
Publishing), a lease with an option to purchase is a tool sellers can use to 
induce a sale, where the buyer lacks sufficient funds for down payment and 
closing costs. Option amounts vary from one deal to another. Lease options 
generally provide that a portion of the rent is applied toward the purchase if 
the option is exercised, referred to as rent credit. 
</P>
<P>
 18. What is the mortgage credit certificate program? 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage credit certificate (MCC) program is a federal income tax credit 
for qualified first-time home buyers. The credit, which often totals in excess 
of $1,000, reduces the borrower's federal tax liability by that amount. Both 
the borrower's income and the purchase price of the home must fall within 
established guidelines. A limited number of California cities have authorized 
the MCC program. Interested home buyers should contact their municipal housing 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 19. Will sellers consider only offers close to, or at, full price? 
</P>
<P>
 "While a very low offer in a normal market might be rejected immediately, in a 
buyer's market the below-market offer will usually either be accepted or 
generate a counteroffer. When few offers are being made, an outright rejection 
of offers becomes unlikely," writes William H. Pivar in "Real Estate Investing 
From A to Z" (Probus Publishing). 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, he said, "There are always some sellers who for some reason must sell 
quickly" and will consider a reduced price. There are other considerations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is the offer contingent upon anything such as the sale of the buyer's 
current house? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is the offer made on the house "as is," or does the buyer want the seller 
to make some repairs before close of escrow?  
</P>
<P>
 -- Is the offer all cash? An offer at less than the asking price may be more 
attractive to the seller than a full-price offer with a financing contingency. 
</P>
<P>
 20. How do adjustable-rate loans work?  
</P>
<P>
 Adjustable-rate mortgages rise and fall with interest rates, based on several 
indexes that cause the cost of funds for lenders to go up or down. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common indexes used in California are the 11th District Cost of Funds 
(an average of the cost of funds to the 11th Federal Home Loan Bank District 
institutions), Treasury Securities (T-bills), Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and 
Libor (London inter-bank offering rate). The Times publishes current ARM index 
rates in the Sunday Real Estate section. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest rate and payment adjustments may or may not be scheduled to 
change at the same time. For example, the interest rate on some plans changes 
more frequently than the monthly payment, which may result in negative 
amortization. 
</P>
<P>
 21. Is there such a thing as a no-cost loan?  
</P>
<P>
 The state's real estate regulatory agency, the Department of Real Estate, is 
cracking down on mortgage brokers who claim to offer "no cost" and "no fee" 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 According to DRE spokesman Pablo Wong, "Advertising claims by brokers of 'no 
cost' or 'no fee' loans are patently misleading and are in violation of the 
State of California Business and Professional Code Section." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because borrowers are actually paying a higher interest rate on the 
so-called "no cost" loan in exchange for not having to pay fees or closing 
costs up front when the loan is secured. No matter what lenders claim, "there 
is no free lunch," said Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 A zero-point loan is one where the lender does not charge points (one point is 
equal to 1% of the loan amount). But there are other fees involved in no-point 
loans, as with most loans. 
</P>
<P>
 22. How can I find a good real estate agent? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips for finding an agent suggested by author Dian Hymer: 
</P>
<P>
 "The best sources of contacts are friends or associates who have bought or 
sold recently and can recommend agents. Be sure to ask your colleagues if they 
would use the agent again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If personal contacts don't generate enough leads, call the managers of 
reputable local real estate companies and ask for recommendations of agents who 
specialize in your neighborhood if you're selling. Find out if the agent works 
full time at real estate and how much experience the agent has." 
</P>
<P>
 23. I'm a buyer and want my own agent, how do I go about it? 
</P>
<P>
 In California, it's legal for an agent to represent the buyers exclusively in 
the transaction and be paid a commission by the sellers. More and more buyers 
are going a step further, hiring and paying for their own agent, referred to as 
buyers brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 24. What should I do if I suspect my real estate agent has done something 
unethical or illegal? 
</P>
<P>
 Report the agent to the enforcement division of the Department of Real Estate. 
If the agent is a member of a local association of realtors, a breach of ethics 
can be reported to one of these trade groups, which are listed in the telephone 
book. The local associations have a disciplinary procedure that promises to 
root out problem agents. They also have the power to revoke the agent's 
membership in the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers who suffered an economic hardship from doing business with a 
licensed real estate agent can appeal for relief from a special state fund. 
Twelve percent of every agent's license fee is deposited in this Real Estate 
Recovery Fund, which is used to pay damages to consumers from civil action 
taken against a licensee in cases where the agent has no funds to pay the 
judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 25. Where do you find a fixer-upper? 
</P>
<P>
 So-called "diamonds in the rough" -- distressed properties or fixer-uppers -- 
can be found in most communities, even the wealthier neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 A distressed property is one that has been poorly maintained and has a lower 
market value than other houses in the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic strategy for a fixer-upper is to find the least desirable house in 
the most desirable neighborhood and then decide if the expenses needed to bring 
the value of that property up to its full potential market value are within 
one's budget. Most experts say buyers should avoid rundown houses that need 
major structural repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 26. Where can I find HUD-repossessed homes? 
</P>
<P>
 HUD-owned properties can be purchased only through a licensed real estate 
broker. HUD acquires properties from lenders who foreclose on mortgages insured 
by HUD. These properties are available for sale to both homeowner occupants and 
investors. HUD pays the broker's commission up to 6% of the sales price. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers should be aware that HUD homes are sold "as is," meaning limited 
repairs were made but no structural or mechanical warranties implied. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, call (800) 275-6747 or stop by 1615 W. Olympic Blvd. for more 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 27. How do you determine which areas are more prone to earthquakes? 
</P>
<P>
 There are several sources to research seismic information. The U.S. Geological 
Survey, located in Menlo Park, can be reached by calling (415) 853-8300. 
</P>
<P>
 State geologists have designated special studies zones along earthquake 
faults. These designations may not disclose all risks -- San Francisco is not 
within a special study zone because the fault doesn't run right through the 
city.  
</P>
<P>
 Check maps kept at your local city or county planning department to find out 
if a property is within a special studies zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, state law requires home sellers to disclose if their property is 
within a Seismic Hazards Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 28. Is there any state agency that governs condominium associations?  
</P>
<P>
 No. However, condominium associations are subject to the Davis-Stirling Common 
Interest Development Act, a portion of the California Civil Code. The 
Department of Real Estate regulates units up until they are sold by the 
developer. Then no one does. Condominium associations are self-regulated by 
covenants, codes and restrictions (CC&Rs) and bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
 29. How are property taxes calculated in California? 
</P>
<P>
 According to the rules of Proposition 13, property taxes are limited to 1.1% 
of the market value of a house. The 1978 tax measure limits increases in the 
taxable value of property to 2% a year but allows property to be reassessed at 
its market price when it is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 One year after the passage of Proposition 13, voters approved Proposition 8, 
which permits the assessor to lower property assessments after considering 
reductions in value due to damage, destruction, depreciation or other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 30. I want to move out of the city and buy another house to retire. Can I take 
my property tax bill with me? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, as long as the new house is of equal or lesser value than the previous 
home. Twelve counties have ordinances allowing people over age 55 and disabled 
people moving from another county to carry their old property tax assessment, 
presuming they meet all state requirements for Proposition 60 or Proposition 
90. Those counties are Alameda, Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, Marin, Modoc, Orange, 
Riverside, San Diego, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 31. Are property taxes deductible from federal and state income taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 Property taxes on all real estate, including those levied by state and local 
governments and school districts, are fully deductible against current state 
and federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 32. The value of my house has gone down. Can I deduct the loss in value from 
my income taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 No. "The IRS allows no deductions for losses on the sale of your own home. 
There's no way to use a loss to your advantage on your income tax return. It 
won't matter what type of misfortune you may have run into," write Edith Lank 
and Miriam Geisman in "Your Home as a Tax Shelter" (Dearborn Financial 
Publishing). 
</P>
<P>
 33. What will increase the value of my property? 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors, including overall market trends, the condition of the 
property, specific home improvements and neighborhood stability can influence 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest rise in home prices occurs when the economy is strong and the 
number of home sales is increasing. In recent times in California, that has 
occurred twice -- in the early 1980s and the late 1980s. During those two 
periods, almost all property in the state appreciated. However, single-family 
homes appreciated much more than condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 While overall market conditions are out of the homeowner's control, other 
factors are not. For example, specific home improvements may increase the value 
above the cost of the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by Remodeling magazine, a bathroom remodeled in the Los 
Angeles area returns 75% to the owner, a bathroom addition 102% and a master 
bedroom suite 78%. 
</P>
<P>
 34. What is the best way for a married couple to hold title? 
</P>
<P>
 Married persons in California may take title to real property as joint tenants 
or tenants in common. In addition, they have a choice unmarried owners don't 
have: to take title as community property, which is the option that many 
experts recommend. When one spouse dies, property held as community property 
goes directly to the surviving spouse without formal probate, unless the 
deceased left their half to someone other than their spouse. In cases of 
"tenancy-in-common," there is no right of survivorship. 
</P>
<P>
 35. We are facing foreclosure. Would a deed in lieu of foreclosure be better? 
</P>
<P>
 A property foreclosure is one of the most damaging events in a borrower's 
credit history; a deed in lieu of foreclosure is not as negative.  
</P>
<P>
 "A deed in lieu of foreclosure," according to "California Real Estate 
Principles, Third Edition," Charles O. Stapleton III, Martha R. Williams and 
Thomas J. Morgan (Dearborn Financial Publishing), "'may be used to transfer 
property to the beneficiary of a trust deed. This may be done, with the 
beneficiary's consent, to prevent a forced sale. Transfer of the property to 
the beneficiary may be to the beneficiary's advantage if the property is worth 
at least the amount of the remaining debt. The trustor benefits by avoiding the 
publicity of a public foreclosure sale."  
</P>
<P>
 According to John W. Reilly, author of "The Ultimate Language of Real Estate, 
4th Edition," (Dearborn Financial Publishing), "A deed in lieu of foreclosure 
is sometimes known as a friendly foreclosure, because it is settled by 
agreement rather than by civil action. The major disadvantage to this type of 
default settlement is that the mortgagee takes the real estate subject to all 
junior liens, whereas foreclosure eliminates all such liens." 
</P>
<P>
 36. Can you explain reverse mortgage loans?  
</P>
<P>
 Many long-time homeowners consider a reverse annuity mortgage (RAM), which 
enables them to borrow against the equity in their homes so they can receive 
monthly payments needed to help meet living costs. Under this plan, the flow of 
funds is in reverse to a conventional loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowner receives periodic (not necessarily equal) payments based on 
accumulated equity, according to author John W. Reilly. Many homeowners who 
worked to pay off a mortgage have shunned the RAM program because they are 
hesitant to take on new debt. 
</P>
<P>
 37. What expenses beyond mortgage interest are tax deductible? 
</P>
<P>
 "Points paid by the buyer are deductible for that year," say authors Edith 
Lank and Miriam S. Geisman. In a new ruling by the IRS, even points paid by the 
seller are deductible. An amended tax return must be filed to take advantage of 
this benefit. Non-deductible expenses include title insurance, loan-application 
fee, credit report, appraisal fee, service fee, settlement or closing fees, 
bank attorney's fee, attorney's fee, document preparation fee and recording 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 38. My house has been on the market for six months and it won't sell, what 
should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a down market, real estate experts say price and condition are the two 
most important factors in selling a home. So, the first step is to lower the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, go through the house and see if there are cosmetic defects that you 
missed and can be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sellers should make sure that the home is getting the exposure it 
deserves through open houses, broker open houses, advertising, good signage and 
a listing on the Multiple Listing Service. 
</P>
<P>
 If the seller is using a real estate agent and the property isn't getting that 
exposure, find another agent. 
</P>
<P>
 39. Who should pay the closing costs? 
</P>
<P>
 Closing costs vary from one transaction to another and often total in the 
thousands of dollars. They may be paid up front or added to the buyer's loan 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, anxious sellers may offer to pay some or all of the costs to induce a 
sale.  
</P>
<P>
 If one or more real estate agents are involved, their commissions are 
traditionally based on the sales price and paid by the seller at the time of 
closing. 
</P>
<P>
 As for typical costs and who usually pays what, real estate writers Ralph 
Warner, Ira Serkes and George Devine, authors of "How to Buy a House in 
California," 2nd California Edition, (Nolo Press), state them as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 Buyer pays: escrow fees, deed preparation fees; recording fees; pest control 
inspection; as well as roof and other inspection charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Seller pays: title search; title insurance for buyer/owner; reconveyance deed; 
documentary transfer tax, and for the one-year home warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 40. The price of my home has gone down. Can I sell it for less than the loan 
amount? 
</P>
<P>
 Some home sellers in this situation can sell for less than the amount of the 
mortgage. It is called a "short sale" or a "short payoff," and may be 
accomplished by negotiating with your lender. A real estate agent or a lawyer 
can help in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 A short sale may be complicated if the loan has been sold into the secondary 
market because then the lender will have to get permission from Fannie Mae or 
Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) to negotiate a short sale. 
Fannie Mae spokesperson Bonnie O'Dell says the secondary market giant has a 
policy of looking at each loan individually. If the loan was a low down payment 
mortgage with PMI, then the lender also must involve the mortgage insurance 
company that insured the loan down payment loan. 
</P>
<P>
 41. How can I avoid paying capital gains taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 In considering capital gains tax from the sale of a primary residence, the 
critical time frame is two years. Generally, the capital gain is the difference 
between the original sales price, capital improvements and some closing costs 
and the eventual sales price. Tax on the gain may be deferred if the sellers 
buy another home of equal or greater value within 24 months. 
</P>
<P>
 People over 55 can qualify for a one-time capital gains exemption of $125,000. 
 
</P>
<P>
 42. What is a seller obligated to disclose? 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, the seller and the seller's broker, if there is one, are 
required to disclose all "facts materially affecting the value or desirability 
of the property which are known or accessible only to him" and which are "not 
known to, or within reach of the diligent attention and observation of the 
buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of residential properties, the seller must provide the buyer with 
a real estate transfer disclosure statement, which specifies the existence and 
condition of all known physical attributes of the property.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sellers are responsible for disclosing only information within their personal 
knowledge. They don't have to hire professionals to answer the questions on the 
disclosure form," says real estate writer George Devine, author of "For Sale by 
Owner" (Nolo Press). 
</P>
<P>
 However, sellers must fill out the form in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the items sellers disclose include homeowners' association dues; 
whether or not work done on the house met local building codes and permit 
requirements; the presence of any neighborhood nuisances or noises that a 
prospective buyer might not notice, such as a dog that barks every night or 
poor TV reception; any death within three years on the property; and any 
restrictions on the use of the property, such as zoning ordinances or 
association rules. 
</P>
<P>
 43. Is it difficult to sell your house yourself to avoid paying a commission? 
</P>
<P>
 While many real estate experts recommend that home sellers engage the services 
of a licensed real estate agent, as many as 16% to 19% of all home sellers sell 
their homes without the use of these services, according to the National Assn. 
of Realtors (NAR). 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 NAR survey showed that 30% of all sellers who sold their homes 
themselves would not do so again the next time. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal issues a seller should consider include discrimination laws, disclosure 
laws and laws governing advertising. False or misleading advertising is against 
the law, and certain terms and disclosures must be included if you are 
advertising the specifics of a financing package.  
</P>
<P>
 For sellers determined to sell the property themselves, various guide books 
are available explaining the process step-by-step. 
</P>
<P>
 44. What should I do to prepare my house to show? 
</P>
<P>
 Making your home look as nice as possible may seem obvious. Apparently, it's 
not, because many sellers don't do much beyond vacuuming the living room rug 
and maybe cleaning the ring off the bathtub, says author George Devine. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of spending a lot of money, Devine offers several steps people can take 
to make their home show better: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sweep the sidewalk, mow the lawn, prune the bushes, weed the garden and 
clean debris from the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clean the windows (both inside and out) and make sure the paint is not 
chipped or flaking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be sure that the doorbell works. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clean and make attractive all rooms, furnishings, floors, walls and 
ceilings. It's especially important that the bathroom and kitchen are spotless. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Organize closets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure the basic appliances and fixtures work. Get rid of leaky faucets 
and frayed cords. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ensure that the house smells good: from an apple pie, cookies baking or 
spaghetti sauce simmering on the stove. Hide the kitty litter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Put vases of fresh flowers throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pleasant background music is a nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
 45. Where can I find foreclosure properties for sale? 
</P>
<P>
 "Notice of foreclosure must be published once a week for three weeks in a 
newspaper of general circulation in the city where the property is located or 
in the city nearest the property in the county where a newspaper is published," 
according to the authors of "California Real Estate Principles," 3rd Edition, 
(Dearborn Financial Publishing). 
</P>
<P>
 For a buyer serious about finding a foreclosure, subscribing to a legal 
publication may be a first step, recommends author William H. Pivar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people don't even know of the existence of these legal papers. 
Therefore, default and foreclosure notices published in such papers are likely 
to mean fewer pre-foreclosure buyers as well as fewer bidders than if the 
notices had been published in a general newspaper," Pivar says.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, written notice describing the property and announcing the time and place 
of sale is posted for 20 days on the property and in a public place in the city 
where the sale is to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 46. I want to buy a foreclosure house "as is." Does this mean there could be 
problems? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, particularly for inexperienced buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying directly at the legal foreclosure sale is a risky and dangerous 
business. It is strictly "buyer beware," cautions James I. Wiedemer in his 
book, "The Smart Money Guide to Bargain Homes, How to Find and Buy 
Foreclosures" (Dearborn Financial Publishing). 
</P>
<P>
 The process has many disadvantages. There is no financing -- such purchases 
require cash and lots of it. The title needs to be checked in some manner 
before the purchase or the buyer could buy a seriously deficient title. 
</P>
<P>
 The property's condition is not well known and generally, an interior 
inspection of the property is not possible before the sale, says Wiedemer. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, only foreclosure and estate (probate) sales are exempt from 
California's disclosure laws. In both cases, the law protects the seller, 
usually an heir or financial institution who has recently acquired the property 
through adverse circumstances and may have little or no direct information 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 47. What happens at a trustee sale? 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee sales are advertised in advance and they require an all-cash bid. 
Author Wiedemer says the sale is usually conducted by a lawyer, sheriff or 
constable acting as trustee. They may or may not be helpful and sometimes 
downright difficult to work with, he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale begins when the lender who holds the first loan on the property 
starts the bidding at the amount of the loan being foreclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that sophisticated investors are present, so novices may find 
themselves among stiff competition for foreclosed property. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful bidder at the foreclosure sale can look forward to a trustee's 
deed, which usually is delivered the following day, Wiedemer says. 
</P>
<P>
 48. How does the lender know how much the projected rents will be on a rental 
property? 
</P>
<P>
 An appraiser does a rent survey to determine rents in the area. The amount a 
landlord can expect to receive in monthly rent largely depends on what the 
property has rented for in the past, the condition of the building, its 
location and the current housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders also look at other cash flow considerations. They want to know if the 
owner has enough reserves on hand to cover predictable and unforeseen expenses, 
such as property insurance, taxes, regular maintenance and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 49. Can a person who has rented out their house for the last three years sell 
that house and defer capital gains tax by using the money to purchase a new 
residence?  
</P>
<P>
 Different tax rules apply to income properties and a primary residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela MacLean, spokeswoman for the Internal Revenue Services' Oakland office 
says, "If people have rented out a property that was once their primary 
residence, they have converted that property to a rental or business property.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they are taking the tax benefits of a business property, like 
depreciation, which you cannot do on a personal home, you must back up and take 
special steps if you want the benefit of capital gains rollover. That is a 
benefit reserved for personal residence," MacLean says. 
</P>
<P>
 50. I recently bought a rental property and want to make sure I maintain a 
good relationship with the tenants. Where can I find out how to legally write 
leases, charge for repairs, etc? 
</P>
<P>
 Landlords can turn to several good books for legal and management advice. 
Some, such as the "Landlord's Law Book," contain sample forms for the tenant's 
move-in condition checklist, owner's notice of intent to enter an occupied unit 
and warning notices.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: LATEST SMOKE DETECTORS ARE MORE SENSITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I want to replace my old smoke detectors with new, more-sensitive 
ones, especially in my children's bedrooms. What is the best type to buy and 
are the 110-volt super-sensitive models expensive to operate? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Although most smoke detectors look alike, new models have improvements 
in sensitivity and convenience. In addition to the 110-volt house current 
detectors with battery backup (cost less than a penny a day to operate), there 
are new 9-volt battery models that have additional safety features. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire experts state that you often have only two minutes to escape a house 
after a fire starts. Just 30 seconds earlier warning from a more-sensitive 
detector can give you time to get your children out safely. At less than $20, 
replacing an old smoke detector is inexpensive insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two smoke-sensing technologies commonly used in residential 
detectors -- photoelectric and ionization. Both are available in 9-volt battery 
and 110-volt house current models. Many of the 110-volt models provide 
networking. If one detector senses smoke, all the detectors beep. 
</P>
<P>
 One new small detector, with a rechargeable battery, screws into a hallway 
light fixture. You screw the light bulb back into the detector. Normal use of 
the hall light keeps the battery recharged (battery life is six years). 
</P>
<P>
 Photoelectric detectors are more sensitive and provide a quicker alarm to slow 
smoldering fires (large smoke particles). A cigarette dropped on a bed or a 
slow fire inside a wall typically produces this type of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Ionization detectors (using radioactive materials) respond quicker to 
fast-burning fires -- stove grease fires or burning newspapers. Choose a 
double-chamber design, which eliminates the effect of humidity on the 
sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 For the greatest protection, you can select a dual technology detector. This 
senses smoke from both types of fires quickly. With dual technology, there is 
also much less chance of annoying false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 For use in rooms with high ceilings or in other hard-to-reach areas, there are 
smoke detectors with light-actuated battery test switches. You just shine a 
flashlight beam at it and it beeps if the battery is still good. 
</P>
<P>
 If you cook like I do, install a kitchen detector with a "hush" button to 
lower the sensitivity for three to seven minutes. Push this button if you 
accidentally burn food on the stove so the alarm won't drive you crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 For the hearing impaired, choose a detector with a combination visual and 
audible alarm. If it senses smoke, a high-intensity strobe light flashes. This 
is detected by your eye, even while you sleep, and awakens you. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 705 for a user's guide of new smoke 
detectors manufacturers listing models, sensing technology, prices, new 
features and family fire safety precaution tips. Please include $2 handling fee 
-- cash or check -- and a self-addressed envelope. Mail to James Dulley, Los 
Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. Allow three to 
four weeks for delivery. Microwave Exhaust Fan Causing Draft 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have a built-in microwave oven with a built-in exhaust fan underneath 
it. Besides losing heat, we can sometimes feel a cold draft blowing in from 
underneath it. How can we stop this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although you don't feel a breeze in the summer, it is wasting energy then 
too. Put some type of vent opening cover, similar to a clothes dryer vent 
cover, over the end of the vent. This involves going up into your attic to find 
the end. These are often just vented inside the attic. 
</P>
<P>
 Check with the microwave manufacturer first about the power of the blower. It 
may not be powerful enough to open a tight-sealing cover. Even if it does not 
seal tightly, a lightweight plastic flapper helps. Proper Size for Furnace and 
Air Conditioner 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I plan to replace my central air conditioner and furnace soon. Is there any 
rule of thumb to determine the size units that I need? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. You should always have a contractor do a computerized analysis. Don't 
accept an "experienced guess." The energy needs of a house depend on too many 
variables for just an estimate. A furnace is rated by the heat content of the 
fuel it consumes. You can install a smaller high-efficiency furnace because it 
produces more usable heat from the same amount of fuel as a larger, 
less-efficient one.

HOT PROPERTY: SURE HOPE HIS SHARKS DIG RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Controversial rapper ICE-T, who co-stars with Keanu Reeves and Dolph Lundgren 
in the upcoming sci-fi film "Johnny Mnemonic," is expanding his Sunset 
Strip-area home while putting his former residence, in the Hollywood Hills, on 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice-T's rock band Body Count, which left Warner Bros. Records last year after 
protests over its song "Cop Killer," just signed with Virgin Records. A new 
album is due out in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer/actor ("New Jack City," "Ricochet"), 34, also co-wrote a book, 
published in April, called "The Ice Opinion," in which he defends himself 
against charges that his albums exacerbate racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 He is building a $250,000 recording studio as well as a solarium and a pool at 
the Sunset Strip-area home that he purchased in 1992 for $1.2 million, sources 
say. The residence is about 5 years old and 4,500 square feet in three levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-room recording studio, which is being sound-proofed, will have an 
8-foot-long and 3-foot-high baby-shark tank when completed this month. John 
Stoddard, who designed Ice-T's house, is working on plans for the pool, which 
is expected to be built within a couple of months, with city-to-ocean views on 
one side. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice-T has listed his former home, which he had leased to a record company from 
New York, at $499,000. He briefly had it on the market in 1992 at $798,000. "He 
paid $630,000 for it and added on a room with a spa, but because of the market, 
we had to ask less," said listing agent Janet Factor of Nourmand & Associates, 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the 1950s but recently remodeled, the house, which has city views, 
has three bedrooms in about 2,600 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer FREDDIE FIELDS ("Glory," "Crimes of the Heart," "American Gigolo" and 
such TV series as "Naked Hollywood" and "The Montel Williams Show") and his 
actress wife, Corinna Tsopei ("Miss Universe 1964," from Greece), have sold 
their home on the Gold Coast of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields was also a leading agent during the 1970s, representing Henry Fonda, 
Joanne Woodward, Peter Sellers, Barbra Streisand, Robert Redford and Liza 
Minnelli, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields and his wife sold their four-bedroom Santa Monica home for just under 
its $1,975,000 asking price to Jerry Pressman, president of Billboard 
Entertainment Marketing, sources say. The Fieldses decided to sell, because 
they have another house at nearby Carbon Beach, which they have been renovating 
and enlarging. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1922, the Santa Monica home, on a double lot with a paddle tennis 
court and a pool, was once owned by Mayor Richard Riordan. Rick Hilton and 
Sherri Kagan, both of Hilton & Hyland, had the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 A house that was built in 1987 on half of the former AHMANSON estate on Harbor 
Island in Orange County has been sold for just under its last asking price of 
$8.95 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is believed to be the second highest price ever paid for a home in 
Newport Beach. The highest sale, at just under $14 million, was in 1988 for the 
house next door, on the other half of the former Ahmanson Estate, owned at one 
time by late banker and arts patron Howard Ahmanson and at another time by late 
violinist Jascha Heifetz. 
</P>
<P>
 The home that just sold was once listed at $22 million, sources say. It has 
been on the market for about five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary in style with arches and a pool in front, the house is about 
16,000 square feet in size, including the basement, which has parking for eight 
cars, an exercise room and a sauna. The home also has nearly 200 feet of bay 
frontage. 
</P>
<P>
 The seller was Richard Hausman, former vice president of Allergan 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and founding president of the University of California 
Irvine College of Medicine Foundation, and his wife, Marilyn. He has been 
chairman of the Orange County chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society and has 
suffered from the disease himself since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer, described as a businessman who owns a large manufacturing company, 
was represented by Gigi Thomas of Coast Newport Properties, Newport Beach. The 
Hausmans were represented by Ann Peters of Grubb & Ellis, Newport Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Pop/rock singer JOHNNY RIVERS, who had 13 Top 40 hits between 1964 and 1967 
(the most enduring was "Secret Agent Man," the theme song for the British TV 
spy series of the mid-'60s), has put his Coldwater Canyon home of 24 years on 
the market at just under $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to sell so he can spend more time at his ranch in Big Sur, where his 
children live, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 His Coldwater Canyon estate has three bedrooms in nearly 3,400 square feet, on 
about three acres, behind gates, with Valley and mountain views. The house was 
built for actress Greta Garbo in 1938 as a country retreat, sources say. A 
black-bottom pool was added later. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Young of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 UPDATE: ROSEANNE and TOM ARNOLD may be headed for divorce court, but the 
$3-million house they were buying through probate court has closed escrow, 
according to public records. The house, mentioned in the May 1 Hot Property 
column, is next door to the Arnold home in Brentwood and is expected to be 
added to the compound.

<P>
 We are thinking about buying a vacation home. Is this a good investment and 
are there tax benefits? 
</P>
<P>
 A vacation home can be purchased for investment purposes as well as 
enjoyment.And yes, there are tax benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors plan ahead by buying a vacation home where they relax on 
weekends, envisioning it as their permanent retirement home later. By buying 
early, they are able to have payments well under way before retirement, 
according to William Pivar's "Real Estate Investing From A to Z," (Probus 
Publishing, Chicago, 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 Another benefit is the interest and property taxes are tax deductible, which 
helps to offset the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Pivar says, "If you live in a vacation home for 14 days a year or 
less, you can take depreciation on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Additional considerations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can the household income carry two mortgage payments over the long-term? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What are the total costs of utilities, upkeep and transportation? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does the investment make long-term economic sense? 
</P>
<P>
 One caution: An owner's plans could change, forcing them to sell or rent their 
vacation home, which might be hard, depending on the local realty market.

YOUR MORTGAGE; AGENCIES SLOW TO CLEAR ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a home mortgage borrower whose application was denied -- or rate 
quote increased -- because of erroneous information in your credit report, a 
new study suggests you could have trouble getting the mistakes corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first comprehensive investigation of its type, the state of Maryland's 
consumer credit commission found that despite claims to the contrary, the 
nation's biggest credit reporting agencies are often unresponsive to consumers' 
requests for corrections of bad data. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland study is significant because of the size of the sample of 
complaints and the length of time covered. It encompassed all 1,018 written 
complaints about credit bureau data irregularities received by the commission 
during 1993. Each complaint alleged that one or more of the three largest 
credit file repositories -- Equifax, TRW and TransUnion -- had either failed to 
respond to the consumer's requests for correction of errors, or had declined to 
change the file. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members of the commission re-contacted the credit bureaus involved to 
determine whether in fact the consumer's file contained erroneous information. 
Commission director Alan T. Fell said he was "absolutely stunned" by the 
results of the project. In 56% of the cases, the credit agency acknowledged and 
corrected errors in the consumer's file -- despite having failed or refused to 
do so earlier when asked by the consumer. In another 13% of the complaints, the 
files "may have included the errors the consumer claimed," according to Fell, 
but investigators determined that the consumer had not previously contacted the 
credit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in 10% of the cases did the credit repositories refuse to change the 
consumer's file after being contacted by the commission. Another 21% of the 
complaints were culled from the study, either because the consumer lived 
outside the state -- beyond the commission's statutory jurisdiction -- or the 
issue didn't really involve any of the three credit reporting agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's so disturbing," Fell said, "is that we documented beyond any doubt 
that (the credit bureaus) aren't doing what they say -- they're not cleaning up 
erroneous files when they're asked to by the consumers directly affected by the 
errors." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of such "foot-dragging and run-arounds" can be disastrous for 
borrowers, said Fell in an interview. "Your mortgage application gets turned 
down, or you're told you're a high-risk borrower, or you don't get the job 
because of negative material in your file. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is serious. We're talking about people's lives here, not abstractions." 
</P>
<P>
 Requests to TRW, Equifax and TransUnion for comments were responded to by the 
agencies' joint national spokesman, Norman Magnuson of the Washington, 
D.C.-based trade group, Associated Credit Bureaus Inc. Magnuson said that while 
the overall error rate in credit files "is extremely small," the industry will 
need to study the Maryland data and methodology regarding responsiveness to 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we're not serving our customers," he said, "we should be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Magnuson also pointed out that the largest credit agencies and lenders have 
been converting this year to "automated consumer dispute verification" (ACDV), 
an electronic system designed to resolve or respond to disputes or requests for 
corrections within 30 days -- and often far quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland study has special significance for the home mortgage field 
because large national lenders increasingly are relying on "merged infile" 
credit checks to make fast, low-cost underwriting decisions on applicants. This 
technique allows a loan officer to call up two or three of the repositories' 
credit files on a particular applicant within three to five minutes at a cost 
of $11 to $13. The raw data is merged by a computer program to eliminate 
duplications. The underwriter can then give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on the 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than use the traditional approach of conducting a full-scale 
residential mortgage credit report -- a costlier ($50-$60) alternative 
involving credit investigators who seek to eliminate errors in the files -- the 
new approach minimizes human involvement. There is often little or no effort to 
detect errors. 
</P>
<P>
 But how accurate is the raw data inside credit files? Though the industry 
insists it is highly accurate given the billions of bits of credit data 
transferred annually, at least one group inside the credit field disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the National Assn. of Independent Credit Reporting Agencies 
(NAICRA) examined a random sample of 1,700 merged infile credit reports on 
mortgage applicants earlier this year and found that 16% of them contained 
erroneous, derogatory information about the applicant's credit history. Another 
3% contained charge accounts and other debts that didn't even belong to the 
applicant, and 2% contained erroneous "public filings" like tax liens and court 
judgments against the borrower. 
</P>
<P>
 How to avoid being bedeviled as a mortgage applicant by bad data in your 
credit file? First, request a copy of your credit reports periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, challenge anything you see wrong in the file. If your requests for 
corrections are ignored or rejected unfairly, take your case to a state 
regulatory agency. As consumers in Maryland discovered, credit bureaus can 
indeed get your records straightened out promptly -- especially if the phone 
call comes from a regulator.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Put shut-off valves on all your hoses to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feed houseplants on a monthly basis. It's their biggest growing season 
thanks to brighter light and more warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set your mower blades higher. Use 2-to-2 1/2 inches for bluegrass lawns, 2 
1/2 to 3 inches for tall fescue, and 1 inch for warm season lawns such as 
bermuda and Zoysia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prepare for the first day of summer by planting hot weather annuals.

GARDENING Q&A; TOMATOES IMPROVE WITH A LITTLE NEGLECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My tomato vines are growing like crazy, but there are no tomatoes 
and hardly any blossoms. What can I do to get tomatoes? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The problem, believe it or not, is too much tender, loving care! 
Although tomato plants often benefit from the application of a relatively 
high-phosphorus fertilizer and plentiful watering for the first month or two 
after planting, too much nitrogen fertilizer and ample water make the plants so 
very happy that they grow just for the fun of it and never get down to serious 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The remedy, surprisingly, is neglect. Once tomato plants start to grow well in 
the garden, stop watering them until they begin to wilt; then water sparingly 
until blooms form. When flowers appear, it helps to gently "tickle" them with a 
finger; that shakes the pollen loose and causes the fruit to set. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fascinating that often, when tomato plants get lazy and then sense a 
threat to their cozy lifestyle, they'll finally go to work and start 
reproducing like crazy . . . and you'll have a fine crop after all! 
</P>
<P>
 So, stop watering those lush, overgrown tomato plants. They'll soon get the 
idea that you mean business, and they'll produce. The Dirt on How to Make Good 
Compost 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do I make good compost? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Successful composting is a rewarding experience, primarily because you earn 
it through personal effort over a period of time. Composting consists of piling 
up grass clippings, leaves, garden refuse, coffee grounds, vegetable waste, 
fruit waste, etc., so it will decompose into a rich humus. Optimal results are 
obtained when you do it this way: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Materials for composting must be smaller than the size of a walnut. Do 
not use diseased ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Stack the debris 4 to 6 feet high inside a bin with slatted sides to 
allow for air circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Add a handful or two of high-nitrogen fertilizer (such as ammonium 
nitrate or ammonium sulfate) with every load of raw material -- this helps 
speed decomposition and adds nutritional value to the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Sprinkle the mass from time to time with water. It should always be about 
as damp as a squeezed sponge. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Turn and mix the heap at least weekly with a spading fork. This is a must 
if you want good compost; it aerates the mix and keeps the bacteria active. It 
also minimizes fly problems. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- In three to six months (depending on temperature and humidity), your 
compost is ready to be screened or sifted; a 1-inch screen will yield humus 
appropriate for general garden use. Return the coarser material to the compost 
pile for further decomposition. What Type of Lilacs Grow Well Locally? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you tell me how to grow lilacs in our area? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Our wonderfully mild winters, unfortunately, prevent us from growing 
several very desirable types of plants that require considerable cold weather 
to thrive. Most lilacs are in this category. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "Lavendar Lady," a fine lilac developed especially for our area years 
ago by Descanso Gardens, does well in almost all local conditions (except right 
on the coast) and is fairly readily available in many garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant "Lavendar Lady" in full sun. It is perfectly adapted to our soils and 
requires only "average" watering, even tolerating some drought when 
established. Shape newly planted bushes for a year or two by breaking the tips 
out of new shoots. Spring feeding with a balanced plant food is beneficial, but 
no other special care is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavendar Lady lilac is an easy-to-grow, often-overlooked prize in our gardens. 
There's a Reason They Call Them 'Annuals' 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I received a beautiful potted Exacum and followed the instructions 
precisely (which is unusual for me), but it still withered away. What happened? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A: Exacums are sold as lovely house plants full of luxuriant emerald foliage 
and beautiful bluish flowers. Two major precautions commonly apply to the 
growing of all house plants: (1) never use "soft" water on house plants; it is 
quickly lethal to them. And (2) always let the soil mix dry out between 
waterings; the most common killer of house plants is over-watering.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, having said that, the problem with your Exacum may not be related to 
water at all. These plants are "annuals"; that is, they thrive for one blooming 
season then automatically die, no matter how much proper care you give them. 
It's in their genes.

GARDEN NEWS: IT'LL BE A HISTORIC SUMMER FOR GARDENERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's good to know our garden roots, because what's been done in the past can 
inspire present endeavors. And, though it is said that we Californians have 
little history and no appreciation for it, we have a rich history of 
horticulture and garden design and this would seem to be the summer to discover 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one, but two, new books on the history of California gardens have been 
published. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Decorative Arts Study Center in San Juan Capistrano they've created 
a vintage California cottage garden just for the summer, filled with plants 
that would have been grown here in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum, a Victorian rose garden has 
been restored, and a new garden with roses grouped historically just opened. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at the historic Lummis house, there is an exhibit of old garden tools, 
seed catalogues, books and photographs that traces the history of gardening 
from the Missions to the first modern gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the new books also trace this trail. They begin with the open patios 
and courtyards of the early Missions and haciendas, progress through the 
various imitative styles from English to Italian, and end with Thomas Church, 
Garret Eckbo and other pioneers of the modern California style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California Garden, and the Landscape Architects who Shaped it" by Jere 
Stuart French (Landscape Architecture Foundation, 4401 Connecticut Ave., N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20008; $45) pays particular attention to the designers, 
putting faces to the names, from Paul Thiene (who did Greystone, the Doheny 
estate) and Charles Gibbs Adams (who did the Harold Lloyd estate), to Church 
and Eckbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "California Gardens: Creating a New Eden," a handsome book by David C. 
Streatfield (Abbeville Press: $55) takes a garden-by-garden approach, beginning 
with four Spanish-era gardens, 10 Victorian gardens, 11 Arts and Crafts 
gardens, and so on, finishing with five contemporary examples, including the 
stunning and innovative Valentine garden in Santa Barbara by Isabelle Greene. 
</P>
<P>
 The romantic California cottage and garden, designed by James J. Yoch and 
Timothy G. Scott for the Decorative Arts Study Center (31431 Camino Capistrano, 
San Juan Capistrano, (714) 496-2132) uses plants that were grown in California 
at the turn of the century. Many are still with us and are again becoming 
popular -- Cecile Brunner and Lady Banks roses, citrus and sycamores, 
carnations and lavender. Others come as a bit of a surprise -- agapanthus, for 
instance, which was grown here as early as the 1860s and became quite popular 
in the 1890s, according to Yoch. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum in Arcadia (301 N. Baldwin Ave.) 
volunteers from the classes of Jan Zalba Smitten have replanted the neglected 
Victorian-style garden near the Queen Anne cottage. Only about a third of the 
roses they used were actually grown during that period, but the remainder are 
old fashioned in appearance, including many contemporary Austin or English 
roses. 
</P>
<P>
 The roses are not planted alone, but in the company of many other flowers, 
perennials in particular -- a typically Victorian mix. For visitors, a fact 
sheet lists the roses by name. 
</P>
<P>
 At Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge (1418 Descanso Drive) the new 
five-acre International Rosarium is open. Although still quite young, there are 
several thousand roses here, including 2,200 antique varieties, with some in 
historical settings. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a Mission-era garden, with Rose of Castile and others planted next to 
Seville orange trees and Spanish herbs and adobe walls; a Victorian garden with 
plantings authentic to that age including the lovely white climbing Sombrueil 
and the many hybrid perpetuals; and even a Lammert's Garden with some of his 
most famous hybrids from the 1950s, including Queen Elizabeth, Charlotte 
Armstrong and Chrysler Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit at the historic Lummis House (200 E. Avenue 43 off the Pasadena 
Freeway; open through July 31 on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 4 
p.m.) illustrates the various eras in California gardens with tools, books, 
original blueprints, photographs, seed and nursery catalogues and other 
objects. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a collection of sprinklers from all eras (an important part of 
gardening in California) and even a selection of early pest control products 
including the Calpro Ant System made by Metlox, an art pottery manufacturer in 
Los Angeles in 1925. Just about everything was made in, or is from, California, 
including the "Easy Hedge Shears, Drop Forged by Arcturus Mfg., Los Angeles" at 
the turn of the century.  
</P>
<P>
 The completely contemporary drought resistant garden surrounding the 
boulder-walled Lummis home brings the exhibit right up to date, neatly 
illustrating where gardening is now in the Golden State. 'Lazy-Bed Gardening' 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to learn about this method of growing vegetables with less expense 
and less detail, look for a new book By Carol Cox called "Lazy-Bed Gardening, 
the Quick and Dirty Guide" (Ten Speed Press: $8.95). In a very readable 
nutshell of 110 pages (and nice big grade-school type), it tells and 
illustrates how to make the deep, double-dug beds this method depends on. It 
helps you plan and choose what to grow in these elegant beds, with some 
information on fertilizing (including green manuring), companion crops and pest 
and disease control. It's a thoroughly satisfying workbook.

APARTMENT LIFE: WHO PAYS TO MOVE FURNITURE DURING REPAIRS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an 
apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in a 150-unit senior-citizens apartment complex in Brea. The 
management here is replacing the old carpeting and repainting the apartments as 
needed. (Boy, do they need it!) When they do this, the tenant is required to 
either get someone to move the furniture or to pay $40 for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the renters are seniors. Most cannot move the furniture themselves and 
simply cannot afford this service. It seems to me that improvements to an 
apartment owner's investment should be considered overhead and not be 
subsidized by the renters. 
</P>
<P>
 What can you tell me about the legality of this practice? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: The practice of charging for services rendered is legal unless it is 
specifically prohibited in your lease, rental agreement or an addendum, like a 
HUD contract, to one of them. Historically, improvements to the inside of 
apartment units have been considered to benefit the renters, rather than the 
owners, of the units. For instance, under state law owners are not required to 
replace carpets or repaint no matter how shabby the carpets may be or dingy the 
paint is. 
</P>
<P>
 If the carpet represents a safety hazard, state law requires that an apartment 
owner must make it safe by repairing or removing it. He is not required to 
replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, if the walls are cracked and represent a health hazard the owner is 
required to patch and touch-up paint them. He is not required to completely 
repaint the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it may seem like a bum deal, $40 for paint and carpeting is a 
pretty good bargain. Pet Is in Violation of Lease Agreement 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We rented our Oceanside condo out to a renter who was to be the sole 
resident there with no pets. Her lease is up next month and now we are getting 
complaints that relatives with a large dog have moved in with her. She claims 
that they are visiting for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the obligations of a renter to observe the terms of a lease agreement 
when it expires and converts to a month-to-month rental agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The terms of the lease remain in effect, except for the length of the 
agreement, even after it expires, if the tenants stay on with your consent. You 
must protect your rights under the agreement, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you have knowledge of the extra renters and pet, and take no 
steps to prevent them from occupying the unit, you may "waive" (surrender) your 
rights to get them out later. 
</P>
<P>
 Even accepting one-month's rent with knowledge of a breach has been 
interpreted by some courts as waiver. Have the renter give you a letter 
identifying the relatives and pets and indicating how long they plan to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't leave when she says they will, or if they plan on staying longer 
than your rules and regulations allow, you should immediately serve the renter 
with a three-day notice to perform or quit (obey the rules or move), unless you 
are willing to accept the extra people and pet. 
</P>
<P>
 If they don't comply with the notice, your next step is to evict them. Seek 
competent legal help for that. Responsibility for 'Built-In' Telephone 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My former husband died and his children and I took care of the estate. We 
moved his property out of the Pacoima apartment where he lived except for a 
wall-mounted, dial telephone he was renting from a large phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 When I mailed the final rent check, I informed the owners that we could not 
figure out how to remove the phone, and endorsed the responsibility for the 
unit to them. My understanding has always been that anything that is affixed to 
the owner's property becomes his property. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
 The phone service to the apartment has been discontinued but we are still 
being billed for the continued rental of the phone unit. What do you suggest? 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Endorsing responsibility" for the phone to the landlord was a bad call. It 
is not a "fixture" since it can be removed and replaced, or the wall easily 
repaired, unlike a bay window, for instance. Title to leased personal property, 
like the phone, does not pass to the landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the liability for the phone passes to the decedent's estate, you should 
give the phone company notice of the death of its former customer with a 
request to remove its equipment. Either way, a general notice to creditors 
published by a decedent's estate cuts off all claims after four months.

NORWAY'S MAGNETIC NORTH; RENTING AN AFFORDABLE FISHERMAN'S COTTAGE IN THE 
LOFOTEN ISLANDS, WHERE THE DRAW IS PRISTINE AIR, FRESH FISH AND MAJESTIC 
LANDSCAPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dale M. Brown, Brown is a Time-Life Books editor in charge of the Lost 
Civilizations series. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You see the Lofoten Islands long before you get to them. They stretch across 
the horizon in a massive, jagged rampart, trapping storms from the sea on their 
windward side. We caught our first sight of them from an incredible spot on 
Norway's west coast, an old trading post called Kjerringoy. My wife, Liet, and 
I were in the company of a bearded Norwegian, Karl Erik Haar, a painter of 
strong landscapes and seascapes, whose favorite subject is the islands floating 
in their ever-changing northern light. 
</P>
<P>
 Haar is a distracted man -- always looking to his side or over his shoulder 
through round-rimmed glasses, as he studies the light, even while he is talking 
to you. Some might think him rude, but I would not be able to focus my 
attention either if I were a painter exposed to a land like this, which seems 
continually to reinvent itself in the sudden shifts of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, as we walked beside Haar around the trading post's cluster of 
red, ocher and white board-and-batten buildings, a boiling, cloudy sky sent 
down a shaft of silver light, threw a rainbow over a white church with belfry, 
tossed rain at us in wide-spaced drops that plopped and splashed into puddles 
left over from the last shower, then lifted like a theater curtain and shone 
thin blue behind the distant islands, now themselves a dark, powdery blue. 
</P>
<P>
 We had only just arrived in Norway's far north with a group of friends, and we 
were already dazzled. Our train had taken us over stony mountains, where 
waterfalls descended the steep slopes in narrow, ropelike lengths, through 
green agricultural valleys dotted with brightly painted houses of toylike 
charm, and up again, high into the mists. 
</P>
<P>
 Well above treeline, at the most elevated point on the Trondheim-Bodo rail 
line, we crossed the Arctic Circle, which was marked by two small stone 
pyramids on either side of the tracks. At this latitude we might have expected 
the landscape ahead to be bleak. But the Gulf Stream, flowing along the 
country's west coast, has a mitigating effect on the climate here, and soon we 
had evidence of this as the train whisked us away from the tundra and the fog, 
down through a series of lush farmed valleys.  
</P>
<P>
 I am a fan of northern realms, drawn by the crisp, invigorating freshness, the 
clarity of the light and the purity of the air. And the Lofoten Islands 
(pronounced LOW-fo-ten), an archipelago of more than 500 square miles that juts 
out into the Norwegian Sea, have all three -- and a whole lot more -- to offer 
travelers searching for new horizons. Their mountain scenery is the kind that 
sets the heart to pounding. 
</P>
<P>
 People who like to hike or climb will find miles and miles of trails through 
birch forests, moors and bogs. And bird-watchers will find about 180 species; 
thousands of raucous cormorants, kittiwakes, auks and puffins inhabit the 
seaside cliffs. For those who enjoy fishing, there are numerous freshwater 
lakes, or a rented boat can take anglers out to sea to hook any of the 110 
different kinds of saltwater varieties, sometimes among seals and whales. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the first day's destination, the island of Vestvagoy, our party had 
to cross the Vestfjorden, the wide body of water separating the mainland from 
the Lofotens, and the scene of the annual cod catch that has been going on here 
for several hundred years. The four-hour journey by coastal steamer from the 
modern port of Bodo began smoothly enough, but soon had us hurtling forward one 
minute and lurching sideways the next as the ship wallowed and pitched in the 
waves. And no wonder: The Vestfjorden is famous for its Moskenesstraumen , or 
maelstrom, one of the strongest tidal currents in the world. So renowned was it 
as a wrecker of ships and killer of men that both Jules Verne and Edgar Allan 
Poe included it in their works, Verne in "20,000 Leaques Under the Sea," Poe in 
"Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque." 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to escape the stuffy atmosphere of the steamer's salon, Liet and I went 
up on deck to breathe in the cold sea air. The closer the ferry approached the 
Lofoten Wall (the local term for the archipelago's saw-tooth profile), the more 
the six large islands constituting it emerged as separate masses. And again I 
was struck how quickly -- and often -- the weather changes this far north. As I 
watched, angled wings of light from smoking clouds descended to the horizon, 
brushed a streak of glittering mercury on the sea, and turned the mountains 
alternately black, gray and green. Then, almost as quickly, mists wreathed the 
peaks and flowed down the slopes like dry-ice vapor. And where only moments 
earlier the sea had glittered, the water deepened to the color of hammered 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We spent the night at a hotel in the port of Stamsund. After feasting on 
grilled salmon and those little butter-yellow, deliciously earthy potatoes that 
northern farmers grow in dark brown loam, we went off to bed. But since there 
is no real darkness in this realm of the 24-hour midnight sun during summer 
months, we drew the drapes tight to shut out the light. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning we boarded a bus charted by Leif Christoffersen, the 
Norwegian organizer of our little party, who, with his American wife, Becky, 
lives near us in Virginia. We were heading for the town of Reine, which lies 
two islands to the south. Liet and I sat up front, across from the driver, a 
pretty blond woman in her 20s. As we stared ahead, viewing the scenery through 
an enormous front window, I felt as though I were watching an IMAX movie on a 
giant screen -- with some of the same heart-stopping action thrown in for 
effect. The confident driver obviously saw herself as a master of the narrow 
road that over its 80-mile course links four of the six islands. She drove with 
disconcerting insouciance, using only one hand to turn the steering wheel as we 
rounded curve after curve. And though Liet now seemed to be doing the driving, 
applying an imaginary brake with her foot whenever the fat-tailed sheep that 
clustered along the roadside seemed in danger of being hit by the bus, I 
decided to hand myself over to fate and enjoy the scenery.  
</P>
<P>
 Not so long ago, the only way to get around in the Lofotens was by boat or 
ferry; today they are linked by bridges and a brand new tunnel that runs from 
Vestvagoy under a broad channel to another island, Flakstadoya. The ride 
provided breathtaking views of broad, green valleys, blue lakes, perpendicular 
mountains and the omnipresent sea, and it packed a surprise as well: the sight 
of white-sand beaches. With turquoise water lapping them, they seemed curiously 
out of place in this cool northern environment. 
</P>
<P>
 A long concrete bridge, only one lane wide, signaled the approach to the 
island of Moskenesoya and to Reine, regarded by many as the most beautiful 
place in Norway -- and we soon saw why. The town sits at the mouth of a fiord, 
its red, white and yellow frame houses strung out across a peninsula and along 
the opposite shore. Rising steeply behind it are steel-gray, granite mountains; 
in the upward sweep of their concave slopes they seemed almost draped against 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Here we would stay for almost a week. One of the Lofotens' major charms is the 
uniqueness of its accommodations. The islanders have converted dozens of little 
fishermen's cottages, known as rorbuer, into self-service units. These provided 
shelter for the intrepid souls who in years past had seasonally ventured north 
in the hundreds to try their hand at cod fishing, a way to line their pockets 
with money when there was a good run. Some rorbuer can be quite plain, but 
most, like the one Liet and I were assigned with some of our friends, are 
delightfully cozy.  
</P>
<P>
 Painted red on the outside with white trim, each of the cabins in our 
particular cluster had a sod roof -- an overhead meadow as it were -- sprouting 
bluebells and buttercups among the grasses. Such a thick blanket of earth, 
besides pleasing the eye, provides insulation against the cold and the wind.  
</P>
<P>
 Our own cabin lay just over a rise. It stood rather precariously on pilings 
anchored to a granite ledge poking out into the fiord. To one side, I could see 
new rows of wooden A-frame racks -- used by the locals to dry cod, a sign that 
tourism has not yet overtaken fishing as Reine's major source of income.  
</P>
<P>
 Together with our four housemates, we explored the premises. A boatroom, with 
a tiny bedroom on the left, opened onto a large, pine-paneled kitchen, where 
two large windows offered silvery panoramas of the fiord. Just off the kitchen 
was the living room, perhaps the oldest section of the cabin, for the walls 
were made of thick, flattened logs, dark with age. Upstairs, squeezed under the 
roof, were two more bedrooms. Unpainted pine cabinets, tables, and low-slung 
chairs and couches created a welcome atmosphere, and we felt instantly at home. 
</P>
<P>
 By pre-arrangement, the rest of our companions -- who occupied equally snug 
rorbuer close by -- joined us that evening for drinks in our cottage, which we 
had personalized with bouquets of pink fireweed picked just outside the front 
door. And when the decibel level reached a din, we all went off merrily to 
dinner in the local restaurant, the Gammelbua (Old Store). I took an instant 
liking to this rustic, shadowy place, crowded with a hearty clientele. Warmth 
from an open fire and the delicious cooking aromas emanating from the tiny 
kitchen followed us upstairs to the loft, where our group sat down at twin pine 
tables illuminated by hanging lamps. At the far end, two whale ribs formed 
parentheses around a single window glowing with evening light. 
</P>
<P>
 None of us had any problems selecting from the menu: tiny pink shrimp as a 
first course and local cod as an entree. By the time our party had finished 
eating, it was almost midnight; but none of us had noticed the lateness of the 
hour because the sky still glowed. As we walked home under a canopy of 
motionless, sleeping clouds, gulls were flying about, mewing and crying, and 
wood smoke drifted on the air.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The members of our group had agreed to take the next day as it came. There 
were more than enough activities for us to choose from. We could hire bikes or 
rowboats. Or, if we wished, we could charter a fishing boat and go, quite 
literally, to Hell, an abandoned village, passing through the maelstrom on the 
way. We could also sail to Vaeroy and Rost, smaller islands to the south, and 
take in their bird colonies.  
</P>
<P>
 Liet's and my pleasure was to wander around Reine and out into the 
countryside. The morning, which had begun gray and damp, turned suddenly bright 
and the town sprang to life. With the break in the weather, the inhabitants 
came out to weed their gardens, mow their lawns, paint trim, make home repairs 
-- though why all this was necessary I could not fathom since everything looked 
in perfect order to begin with. In addition to a meticulously kept garden, each 
house displayed blooming plants in its windows. Framed by snowy lace curtains, 
they suggested the coziness that must lie within, the antidote, I supposed, to 
gray, lusterless days when the storms roar in. 
</P>
<P>
 On our meandering walk, we went down to the harbor and found the doors to a 
warehouse wide open and ventured inside for a peek. It was stacked from floor 
to ceiling with dried cod, piled up like firewood, ready for shipment. I 
expected a fishy odor; instead, there was barely any, an indication of how 
effective is the process of drying the cod in air as clean and brisk as this. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of our friends wanted to fish, and we joined them the following day 
for a trip in a small rented vessel, first motoring along the coast on a side 
trip to the Refsvikhula Cave. The cave boasts 2,500-year-old rock carvings 
discovered only a few years ago. Putting into a quiet cove, we followed a 
narrow trail that hugged the steep slopes of the mountains, descended to a 
white-sand beach, and hopped from one huge boulder to another between which 
were snagged enormous logs that had drifted all the way from Siberia. The 
379-foot-long cave interior turned out to be spectacular, carved into an almost 
cathedral-like space by the sea about 100,000 years ago, with aisle, transepts, 
nave and a soaring 165-foot ceiling. The carvings were a disappointment by 
comparison, stick figures that our guide's dying flashlight did little to 
illuminate. 
</P>
<P>
 Later we reached a shoal where fish from deeper waters come up to feed. As we 
lowered our hand lines over the railings, the sun, hidden much of the 
afternoon, suddenly came out, filling us with optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Yanking gently on the lines, we could feel the fish bite. Liet caught 12 of 
them in almost as many minutes, two sleek mackerel and 10 sei , or pollock. The 
wooden locker on deck was soon filled with our bounty, including several 
bright-eyed, white-bellied cod. It seemed wasteful to go on catching more fish 
if we could not eat them all, so we pulled in our lines.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Reine, our group agreed to take turns cooking all this fish in a kind 
of progressive dinner that would occur over three nights in different cabins. 
The first belonged to Leif and Becky and their Norwegian friends and cabin 
mates, Kaare and Metta. Metta prepared the cod in the traditional Norwegian 
way, bringing thick slices of the snow-white flesh to a boil in salted water, 
to which she had added a little vinegar, then cooked them for only a few quick 
minutes. She served the steaming fish with a pitcher of drawn butter to pour 
over it, boiled new potatoes and a dill and cucumber salad. The snow-white cod 
could not have been more perfect, falling into flakes at the pressure of a 
fork. But the surprise for me was the liver, which Metta had popped into the 
pot. I will admit to tasting it tentatively, fully expecting it to be as fishy 
as cod liver oil; instead, it had a delightful, mild taste, almost like 
sweetbreads. 
</P>
<P>
 If, in the unlikely event that our group had run out of the fish we had 
caught, we could easily have bought some, as Liet and I discovered the next 
afternoon on another of our walks, this time across a bridge to the little 
island of Sakrisoy. 
</P>
<P>
 After the long hike, we were glad to find that the local doll museum had a 
cafe, where the woman behind the counter had just made Norwegian waffles in a 
round iron divided into heart-shaped segments. We couldn't resist, and they 
came piping hot and egg yellow, with dollops of pale butter and big spoonfuls 
of raspberry jam. Marvelous.  
</P>
<P>
 As we were sitting in the window, sipping the last of our coffee, we spotted 
the seafood market: a van, open at the back, with steps leading up to it. Run 
for the benefit of seasonal visitors like us, it belonged to the local salmon 
farm and processing plant. We decided to have a look. Its clean-smelling 
treasures were spread out on chipped ice, and among these were slabs of smoked 
salmon. The friendly woman in charge must have seen me ogling the salmon, for 
she cut off a generous slice and urged us to sample it. One bite was enough; we 
could not resist the buttery consistency, the light smoke taste or the price, 
which was several dollars less than we would have paid at home. We bought a 
whole side to share with our friends. 
</P>
<P>
 To our consternation, it began raining, and neither of us looked forward to 
getting soaked on the way back to Reine. When we asked the woman who sold us 
the salmon if there was a bus we could catch, she kindly volunteered to drive 
us home. She reassured us that she really was not going out of her way on our 
account; she had an errand to do in Reine.  
</P>
<P>
 With cod still a mainstay of the islands' economy, some of us decided to make 
a visit to an open-air fishing museum at a village called, strikingly enough, 
A, pronounced "awe." We journeyed there by local bus, along the rocky coast. 
One run-down building housed a pathetic collection of memorabilia, bits and 
pieces of the past, flotsam almost, that proved strangely touching. Here were 
the relics of a harsh, demanding way of life -- rusty hooks, splintered oars, 
coils of frayed rope. One wreck of a boat, typical of the kind used in the old 
days, showed how exposed to the elements the eight men who rowed it had been, 
and of course there had been no weather reports to warn them of sudden storms 
that often took a sad toll of lives.  
</P>
<P>
 The open-air museum at A consisted of 20 or so buildings clustered around a 
commanding manor house, dating to 1864, which once was home to the local 
squire. The squire's high standard of living derived from the fishery; with the 
introduction of the potato and smallpox vaccine, the population in southern 
Norway swelled and the demand for fish to feed it grew apace. In 1896 there had 
been enough rorbuer in A alone to accommodate the 300 men who arrived each 
winter to participate in the fishery.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not least of the happy challenges we met in the Lofotens was a climb up one of 
the steep slopes behind Reine. Liet and I are not climbers, and mercifully this 
peak was gentler than most. Still, it required effort. Our entire group 
maneuvered upward, single file, passing an eerie black lake, one of several 
created in the islands thousands of years ago by glaciers. After the ice began 
melting, the depressed land rebounded from the great weight that had lain upon 
it, and the arms of some fiords were left landlocked. To this day, their 
saltwater, called fossil water, still lies trapped at the bottom of the lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 So wet was the moss underfoot, it actually squirted as we stepped on it. But 
whatever effort went into the climb, we were more than rewarded when we reached 
the top. From there, we had a sweeping view south and could see, through 
tissues of clouds, the hulking islands of Vaeroy and Rost. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was something else to delight us as well: a meadow filled with 
arctic cloudberries. This orange fruit the size of a large raspberry grows on 
the tundra at high elevations and is regarded by the Norwegians as an enormous 
treat. A rich source of vitamin C, it used to be the islanders' winter cure for 
scurvy, and the berry's high benzoic acid content meant that the fruit could be 
preserved for months at a time without benefit of sugar. The plants stand only 
inches high, and generally hold a single berry each, which says something about 
the patience needed to gather a pailful of the sweet-sour fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 On our last day in the Lofotens, Liet and I remained housebound. And smart we 
were: The Lofoten weather put on as fine a display of its ferocity as we had 
yet seen, one best observed inside. The wind howled and shrieked, the cabin 
shuddered on its pilings, the wind swept up between cracks in the floorboards. 
A great clap of thunder startled us. Yet for all the tumult, we were warm and 
cozy. We drank blueberry tea, ate milk chocolate and talked about how lucky we 
were to have seen this rare, unblemished part of the world. And then, as so 
often happens in the Lofotens, the storm ran out of energy, the sun came out, 
and a rainbow spread a long handle of color over Reine. GUIDEBOOK: North by 
Norway 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: The Lofoten Islands are in Norway's far north, above the Arctic 
Circle, and the journey there is long. There are no nonstop flights from LAX to 
Oslo, but SAS, KLM, Delta and British Air all fly there via connections in New 
York, Amsterdam or London. Current lowest advance-purchase round-trip fare is 
$1,088. From Oslo, there is train service to Bodo via Trondheim, in the 
country's midsection; the Trondheim-Bodo trip alone takes about 10 hours, but 
the scenery is spectacular. You can also fly directly from Oslo to Bodo (about 
$275 round trip), and take a 4 1/2-hour ferry ride to the islands (about $40 
one way), or fly from Bodo to the Lofotens (about $95 one way). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: Simple fisherman's cottages, or rorbuer , range in style from 
basic to very comfortable. Reine is considered the most beautiful location, and 
there's a restaurant close to the cabins; in other locations, there may be no 
restaurants, and visitors must cook. Costs range from $100-$264 per cabin per 
night, depending on number of bedrooms and amenities. A company that 
specializes in booking rorbuer stays is Borton Overseas (5516 Lyndale Ave. 
South, Minneapolis, Minn. 55419; telephone 800-843-0602, fax 612-827-1544). For 
hotel accommodations, contact the Norweigan Tourist Board.

TRAVEL INSIDER: INAUGURAL TRIPS HAVE CACHET, BUT CAN BE TROUBLESOME; CRUISES: 
PASSENGERS WHO LIKE TO BE FIRST ON DECK MAY NOT FIND EVERYTHING SHIPSHAPE 
ABOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the vocabularies of certain travelers, there are few words as seductive as 
"inaugural cruise." 
</P>
<P>
 To committed cruise ship passengers, who prize comfort and familiarity at 
least as highly as novelty, an inaugural cruise promises the best of both 
worlds: It's an adventure, yet each step of the way is largely shaped by 
tradition, from the tuxedos on formal nights to the commemorative gifts offered 
the captain by local worthies at each new port. Last month I glimpsed this 
world aboard the Aruba-to-San Francisco cruise of Royal Cruise Line's Star 
Odyssey -- not a new ship, but a newly acquired ship (it formerly sailed as the 
Royal Viking Star) with a new crew and $20 million in renovations to go with 
its new name. 
</P>
<P>
 A maiden cruise is an intriguing spectacle, and the idea of it might well 
attract a traveler who has never cruised before. Beyond that, there are a lot 
of inaugurations out there: The Cruise Lines International Assn., which counted 
131 ships in the North American cruise market at the end of 1993, reports five 
inaugurals scheduled for this year, seven more next year, and 10 more in 1996. 
(Cruise company catalogues identify inaugural offerings and, in addition, can 
provide useful clues to a line's character and target audience.) 
</P>
<P>
 But newcomers, beware. If luxury, ease and flawless repose are what you're 
after -- and those are usually the big selling points for cruising -- you're 
far more likely to find them on a veteran vessel. On a maiden cruise, things 
inevitably go wrong -- sometimes small things, sometimes large. (The most 
dramatic example of the latter, of course, is the Titanic, which was on its 
inaugural cruise when it ran into that iceberg off Newfoundland in April, 
1912.) 
</P>
<P>
 Troubles these days are more likely to be on the order of tepid soup, idle 
Jacuzzis, or flubbed plumbing, but since the average cruise passenger pays 
$175-$225 per day, such flaws are closely watched. 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage to inaugural trips can be price. After years of selling 
inaugurals at a premium because of high demand, cruise lines now often offer 
them at the same rates as more conventional cruises, and sometimes for less, 
especially if the itinerary is an awkward one designed to get the ship in 
position for its next cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also true -- though no traveler should choose a cruise on this basis -- 
that cruise line officials pay particular attention to mishaps on inaugural 
cruises, and sometimes try to soothe passengers and control public-relations 
damage afterward by offering make-good discounts on future cruises. By the end 
of the American Family Cruises' snafu-ridden first journey last December, the 
company's executives were promising free future cruises to 1,000 parents and 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the price, the attractions of inaugurals tend to be more intangible. A 
passenger becomes part of history, and gets to prowl new decks, explore new 
cabins, pass judgment on the interior design, and probably be closely listened 
to by crew members and others eager for feedback.  
</P>
<P>
 A newcomer on an inaugural cruise will also find himself or herself in the 
company of cruise junkies, a fervent and affluent bunch so in love with 
cruising that they're quick to board a new ship, and not all that concerned 
about the itinerary.  
</P>
<P>
 Travelers should note that all inaugurals are not created equal: Some ships 
undergo shakedown cruises to work out kinks before taking on passengers for 
their inaugural voyages. (Crystal Cruises' brand new Crystal Symphony, due to 
embark its first passengers next May in New York for a trans-canal cruise to 
Los Angeles, will first cross the Atlantic from its shipyard in Europe.) And 
some companies have so much experience in adding new ships that floating a new 
one can be very nearly business as usual. (Carnival Cruise Lines, with a fleet 
of nine and two more due in the next 18 months, fits into that category.) 
</P>
<P>
 And what exactly can go wrong on an inaugural cruise? 
</P>
<P>
 First, keep in mind that the Star Odyssey's Aruba-San Francisco 
quasi-inaugural cruise last month was viewed as an overall success. Port calls 
in Curacao and Costa Rica went nearly flawlessly; the Panama Canal transit was 
faster than most. Yet the following first-week glitches cropped up: 
</P>
<P>
 The galley's metal plate covers turned out to be the wrong size, allowing many 
meals to cool before serving. Many cabins, including some pricey suites, had 
undersized or missing shower curtains. The decks were unvarnished. The 
hamburger-and-hot-dog grill on the top deck was closed. Laundry service ran a 
day behind. And after a few days, an unpleasant smell spread along the hallways 
of the seventh deck. And in an incident that may or may not have been 
inauguration-related, near Curacao the ship rolled severely, half-emptying the 
pool, dislodging and smashing scores of bottles, and staggering hundreds of 
brittle-boned passengers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a negative person," said Doris Luebke of Glendora, veteran of a dozen 
cruises and two previous inaugurals. "But I'm having a hard time being positive 
on this cruise." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she was outnumbered. "It's a little like buying a new house," said Louise 
Eder of La Habra. "There's bound to be something wrong." "It's a little noisy, 
and a little smelly, but the decor is beautiful," said Hanna Kuehn of Moscow, 
Idaho, who was on her 20th Royal cruise. "You have to give them time."

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; FIRES ARE OUT IN GALAPAGOS 
</P>

<P>
 The fires that raged across Isabela Island in the Galapagos archipelago, a 
popular destination for cruise ships and eco-tourists who flock to the area to 
see the giant tortoises, are finally out. 
</P>
<P>
 The last embers were doused days ago, said Felipe Cruz, deputy director of the 
Galapagos National Park, after burning since mid-April and destroying about 
5,000 acres. Santa Cruz Island, which has the greatest number of tourist 
facilities, was not affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were fears that some of the huge tortoises would perish in the 
blaze, none were affected, Cruz said. But Cruz said authorities did decide to 
take advantage of helicopters sent in by international firefighting forces to 
move 13 tortoises to a breeding area in the village of Puerto Villamil, on the 
Isabela Island coast. This is a long-term project to save the endangered 
animals, Cruz said. In addition to helicopters, authorities used trucks and 
mules to move the tortoises, which weigh hundreds of pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge fire burned an inland area that is not open to visitors. Cause of the 
fire is under investigation, Cruz said, although natural causes have been ruled 
out and there is speculation that it may have been started by hunters. A 
Trolley Tour of J.F.K.'s Boston 
</P>
<P>
 "J.F.K.'s Boston," a new three-hour trolley tour of famous Kennedy landmarks 
-- from his birthplace in Brookline to his favorite restaurant (the Union 
Oyster House) to the Omni Parker House Hotel, where he announced for the 
presidency -- is being offered through Oct. 23 aboard the Old Town Trolley. The 
tours begin at 8:30 a.m. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Tickets are $20 for 
adults and $10 for kids. For reservations and information, call (617) 269-7150. 
Summer Classes at Grand Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 The Grand Canyon Field Institute, which offers classes and workshops at the 
canyon, has released its summer schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes, which continue through November, include "Canyon and Dinosaurs," 
"Ethnobotany" and a workshop on ecosystems that includes a rafting trip. 
Classes are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Wilderness hikes are 
limited to 10 and fill quickly. Fees range from about $45 for a one-day 
workshop to $205 for a five-day backpack trip. Campsites in Mather Campground 
will be provided free to participants and a few rooms will be reserved at 
Yavapai Lodge at an additional charge. Both are on the South Rim. To obtain a 
schedule, contact the institute, P.O. Box 399, Grand Canyon, Ariz., 86023; tel. 
(602) 638-2485. Norway Rail Introduces Pass 
</P>
<P>
 A new Norway Rail Pass, offering unlimited travel for seven or 14 days, has 
been introduced by Norwegian State Railways. Prices range from $180 to $315 
during the May-September peak season. U.S. ticket agent is Scanam World Tours 
Inc., tel. (800) 545-2204; fax (201) 835-3030.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; JUST THE FACTS; HOW TO CHOOSE A TRAVEL AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Institute of Certified Travel Agents, an international organization, has 
issued the following guidelines to help travelers select an agent. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Ask friends for recommendations.If possible, consult friends with similar 
tastes and needs to yours. 
</P>
<P>
 2) See if an agent has earned a Certified Travel Counselor designation, 
signifying that he or she has completed extra professional training and has at 
least five years of full-time experience. 
</P>
<P>
 3) See whether the agent and/or his or her company is affiliated with industry 
organizations such as the American Society of Travel Agents, the Assn. of 
Retail Travel Agents, the Cruise Lines International Ass., the International 
Airlines Travel Agent Network or the National Assn. of Cruise Only Agencies. 
</P>

THE PARTY'S OVER?; GOVERNMENT LOSES IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On Tuesday, San Jose voters elected a dead politician. The City Council 
candidate, who died last month, won 62% of the vote. What happened in San Jose 
captures the mood of Californians who bothered to vote in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has been written about the record-low turnout, the historic rejection of 
all the bond issues, the mean-spirited electorate and nasty campaigns. But what 
do Tuesday's results portend for California's government and politics? 
</P>
<P>
 Elections are driven by who turns out to vote. According to The Times exit 
polling, the electorate that showed up Tuesday was largely composed of the 
classic high-propensity voter: older, white and more affluent. They don't like 
politicians; they hate to spend taxpayer money. The disproportionate impact of 
this group has been increasing for some time. But never has the erosion of the 
electorate accelerated so quickly and seldom has it hit with such traumatic 
repercussions as it did last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason voters didn't show up was that they didn't see any big choices to 
be made. The major parties' nominations for governor and U.S. senator appeared 
to have been decided. Only the margin of victory remained in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower-ballot races didn't generate any heat, either. Candidates with money 
tend to target likely voters, which perpetuates the unrepresentative nature of 
the electorate. As one forlorn caller to a radio talk-show put it last week, 
"If you don't pay attention to the people who haven't voted, they won't vote." 
</P>
<P>
 This helps to explain the bond-issue massacre. Older, middle-class property 
owners whose opposition to spending and taxes is virtually an article of faith 
lined up to torpedo the bond proposals and the renter's credit. Returns show 
that the earthquake bond did well in counties recently hit by quakes, but not 
in those where the ground has not moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Which points up a disturbing pattern in Tuesday's balloting: self-interest 
appeared to outweigh any sense of the public good. That kind of voting behavior 
can only further destabilize an already balkanized commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other elements of the voters' across-the-board rejection of bond 
issues that raise questions of governance. For years, passage of bond issues 
was a virtual certainty. But in 1992, a $1-billion transit-bond issue, backed 
by Gov. Pete Wilson, failed. In November, 1990, 12 of 14 bond measures were 
defeated. And this year, polls taken after the Northridge earthquake clearly 
showed a voter preference for taxes over additional bonding authority to pay 
for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that voters seem to have figured out that financing 
government with bonds is no free lunch. They are beginning to understand that 
there are real costs to bond financing that come right out of taxpayers' 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that there is little political will to finance public services 
by any other means. 
</P>
<P>
 One, voters don't trust government. Period. Two, the recession and the 
changing nature of the state's economy have made Californians more cautious 
about any spending -- their own and their government's. Three, politicians have 
learned the joys of taking refuge in delayed-payment bonds, yet another 
manifestation of the post-Prop. 140 political climate. With the term-limit 
clock running, politicians have little hesitation ordering up expenditures and 
leaving the bill for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 There's something else at work in the extraordinary defeat of the school bond. 
It reflects an older electorate detached from the public-school system. Along 
with the lackluster race for state schools' chief, it may also reflect a 
perception among some Californians that state government is irrelevant, if not 
detrimental, to improving the quality of schools. These voters may see 
education as a local matter and choose to put their energy there. 
</P>
<P>
 But the over-arching message of the primary is the message of term limits, of 
Ross Perot, of elections and public-opinion polls over the past few years: 
Californians are frustrated and angered by a system of state government and 
politics they perceive as unaccountable and unresponsive. Last week, 
Californians displayed that anger and frustration by staying away. 
</P>
<P>
 The pros and pundits decry the California electorate as "disengaged." Is it? 
Or is it re-engaged ? It may not be that Californians have lost their sense of 
community as much as the concept of community is undergoing redefinition. That 
offers both hope and a challenge to governance. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians may be turning away from participating in formal governmental, 
political and societal institutions. They may be refocusing their lives -- and 
participation -- around "communities," which seem more meaningful and 
responsive. People are connecting with a generation, a church or the Internet. 
They are not connecting with institutions of government and politics that lack 
a clear relevance to their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a hint of that in the media's coverage of Tuesday's results. Election 
wrap-ups marked the political state of California: Wealth won. Latinos won. 
Crime fears won. The Christian right won. Gays won. Women won. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about California?

NORTH NOMINATION INCREASES ODDS OF GOP FRATRICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Phillips, Kevin Phillips, publisher of American Political Report, is 
the author of The Politics of Rich and Poor. His most recent book is Boiling 
Point: Republicans, Democrats and the Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity 
(Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A funny thing happened to the Republicans on their way to riding America's 
disappointment with Bill Clinton back to national political dominance. The 
GOP's own fratricide has gone into overdrive -- led by Oliver L. North, the 
famous Marine lieutenant colonel turned Washington-basher, hero of the 
Christian right and devil figure of the GOP Establishment. His U.S. Senate 
nomination in Virginia, attained last week-end, is a political hand grenade 
that threatens to blow out one side of the Grand Old Party's "big tent." And 
not just in Virginia, but nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, that's because North's chief backers, the religious right, may be 
past their peak in national support, but they're still increasing their clout 
in the GOP. Party leaders worry that the controversy over North could provoke 
another crippling backlash like the one produced by the 1992 convention -- or, 
alternatively, seed a religious-right third-party bolt, which could also be 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, meanwhile, are not in any position to laugh. Midterm congressional 
elections, like those in November, are usually a referendum on the party in the 
White House -- so Republicans could gain three or four Senate seats and 18 to 
25 House seats, putting them just shy of control. This means, in 1995-96, an 
already weakened Clinton would confront the largest GOP opposition that a 
Democratic President has faced since 1951-52. Any North or religious-right 
embarrassment to the GOP won't outweigh Whitewater or Paula Corbin Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP's problem is that a 1994 midterm success doesn't ensure any similar 
prospect for 1996. If anything, increased GOP numbers on Capitol Hill may only 
focus attention on party political divisions and the cultural tensions between 
well-heeled pin-stripers who want a 1996 convention city with good hotels and 
clubs and religious fundamentalist forces more concerned about sermons and 
trailer hookups. 
</P>
<P>
 North's Senate race could also reveal declining political loyalty to both 
major parties. Despite his ability to win at a Virginia party convention 
dominated by rural, small-town and churchgoing supporters, North's 
controversial 1989 conviction for lying to Congress (later set aside) blocks 
him from ever expecting a majority of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, such weakness would reelect the Democratic incumbent. But Charles S. 
Robb has also lost credibility because of scandal. So outgoing Democratic 
governor, L. Douglas Wilder, throwing party loyalty to the winds, has decided 
to run as an independent. J. Marshall Coleman, a former GOP gubernatorial 
nominee with ties to moderates, is also moving toward an independent candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fragmentation could be unprecedented. I cannot remember any Senate race 
where both parties split, with factions of each deciding to mount independent 
candidacies. True, Virginia may not be typical -- one senator, Harry F. Byrd 
Jr., was elected as an independent in 1970 -- but this double breakdown of 
party loyalty may be prophetic nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Jesse Jackson's current refusal to rule out an independent 
presidential bid in 1996 adds to Wilder's demonstration that African Americans 
are losing their traditional commitment to the Democrats. Meanwhile, the GOP's 
dilemma in keeping its moderates in harness with religious conservatives, 
populists and nationalists goes far beyond North. Americans, as a whole, 
continue to tell pollsters what they started saying during the 1992 Ross Perot 
hubbub -- this country needs a new third party. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP's problem, of course, is that keeping its preachers and populists in a 
common formation with its financial, corporate and lobbying insiders is a 
high-wire act. The GOP was shaken by related tremors in 1988 and 1992: first, 
when religious broadcaster Pat Robertson sought the presidential nomination; 
then, four years later, with Patrick J. Buchanan's primary challenge to George 
Bush, and then by Perot's ability to draw off a fatal number of predominantly 
Republican voters in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, intra-GOP divisions have worsened since Bush left the White 
House -- just as the fissures within the Democratic Party widened after it lost 
power in 1968. The key is if the GOP's religious right feels taken for granted, 
much as the Democrats' racial, ethnic and cultural minorities did back in the 
1960s and 1970s -- both groups neglected by a party Establishment eager for 
their votes, but even more worried about a backlash from too close an 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 The last few years have made religious-right strategists shrewder. They won't 
try again for the party presidential nomination. Instead, they're digging in at 
the grass-roots level, taking over school boards and local GOP organizations 
and dropping hints that if their agendas are ignored, Christian conservatives 
could go for an independent movement in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether North wins or loses, his 1994 Senate bid has to be seen as a strategic 
litmus. The Republicans won Virginia's 1993 statewide elections, aided by about 
75% support from the state's population of white, Christian churchgoers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was one conspicuous failure. The party candidate for lieutenant 
governor, Michael Farris, a religious-right supporter, got only 45% of the 
total statewide vote because such Establishment GOP leaders as Sen. John W. 
Warner refused to support him and implicitly agreed with his characterization 
as an extremist. This infuriated religious-right leaders. Now, with Warner and 
other GOP centrists taking the same hostile approach to North, a watershed 
could be at hand: Some of these people are not going to be able to stay in the 
same tent.  
</P>
<P>
 For the GOP's problem does not end with Virginia. The religious right 
represents a huge pivotal chunk of the party rank and file. Indeed, by some 
calculations, in 1992, born-again white Christians cast about one-third of the 
national votes for Bush. Fundamentalists alone cast one in five. Like gays and 
other minorities on the Democratic side, white Christian conservatives are now 
dedicated to proving their muscle -- most prominently by taking over Republican 
party organizations and conventions in some 15 to 20 different states. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not just Southern or Bible Belt strongholds like South Carolina, 
Oklahoma or Virginia. In recent years, the religious right has taken over the 
state GOP or parts of it in the Midwest -- including Michigan, Minnesota and 
Iowa -- and in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle also extends to some of the biggest states. In Texas, religious 
conservatives are poised to take over this month's GOP state convention. In 
Pennsylvania, religious conservatives won 40% of the state committee posts on 
the ballot two years ago, and made additional gains in this year's balloting. 
These Texas and Pennsylvania trends aren't local minutiae. Equally to the 
point, religious-right voters turn out with an enthusiasm and commitment that 
often makes their candidate run ahead of poll indications. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's also a drawback. When the Christian right takes over state GOP 
organizations, it scares moderate voters away. The same thing often happens 
when religious-right stalwarts win party nominations. Even this year, one or 
two U.S. Senate seats and a half-dozen House seats could be lost that way. 
</P>
<P>
 If this schism within the GOP turns into a full-fledged split, it could do as 
much damage as the Democrats' division did in the 1960s and '70s. North isn't 
just another candidate. What happens to him this year -- and how the national 
GOP Establishment deals with him -- will tell us much about both the politics 
of culture and the future of the Republican Party in the 1990s. So far, the 
hand-grenade scenario looks like an even bet.*

WHY THE BIG APPLE IS NO ECONOMIC MODEL FOR L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Friedman, David Friedman, director of the New Economy Project, writes 
frequently on regional and technology issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the New York media have relentlessly trumpeted California's demise, the 
Northeast is the last place that should celebrate California's economic 
difficulties. Starting from virtually the same non-farm employment base, New 
York City-area job losses during the recession exceeded those in all Los 
Angeles County by more than 53,000. And Los Angeles County itself accounted for 
75% of California's total job losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The true cover story of the recent recession should have been the continuing 
industrial dysfunction of America's largest metropolis. While many California 
politicians seem strangely beguiled by economic policies that were born in the 
East, New York City, after decades of decline, could only watch helplessly as 
it hemorrhaged another 12% of its employment base in the early 1990s. Far from 
seeking insight from the architects of such a woeful economy, the most 
important lesson for California is to understand, then avoid the political 
pathologies behind New York's industrial paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's collapse was especially poignant because it followed years of 
spectacular decline, interrupted only briefly by the financial-services boomlet 
of the mid-1980s. Between 1970-90, more than 573,000 people left New York City, 
the second-largest population exodus suffered by any U.S. metropolitan region. 
By contrast, Los Angeles gained 673,000 new residents in the same interval -- 
highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951, New York was home to nearly 1.1 million manufacturing jobs, easily 
the largest such concentration in the world. By the end of the recession, about 
300,000 manufacturing jobs remained, a meager 9% of the city's total 
employment. More than 640,000 manufacturing jobs -- 18% of total employment -- 
survived the recession in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 50% of the 446,000 jobs lost in Los Angeles County during the 
recession were directly caused by the federal government's defense cuts -- not 
by adverse economic fundamentals. Deindustrialized New York had almost no 
defense-industry exposure. Yet, it still experienced a staggering decline of 
509,000 jobs spread among its business service, finance, insurance and real 
estate, non-durable manufacturing, construction, retail and wholesale trade and 
durable manufacturing sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of New York's continuing demise is an elitist industrial ideology 
embraced by an enduring political coalition. As early as the mid-'60s, New 
York's leaders were indifferent to what they saw as "crummy" jobs in such 
then-flourishing sectors as garments, metalworking and sophisticated 
electronics. Instead, they wanted to build a "post-industrial" society centered 
on "high-tech" financial services and tourism, coupled with aggressive welfare 
relief. Out of these ideas grew the narrow coalition that still dominates New 
York -- large developers and Wall Street mandarins, the 450,000-member 
municipal employee and construction unions that serve them, and the 
welfare-dependent underclass. 
</P>
<P>
 As New York relentlessly pursued its post-industrial fantasy, unrepresented 
but critical parts of the economy like manufacturing were zoned, regulated and 
taxed, with virtually nothing gained in return. Hundreds of thousands of 
manufacturing and other jobs left the area, severely reducing the standard of 
living for all but the privileged business elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly hard hit were immigrants. In 1960, before its industrial base was 
decimated, New York's Latino population enjoyed relatively high income levels 
and work-force participation rates. By the end of the 1980s, as hundreds of 
thousands of immigrants, especially from Puerto Rico, found little or no 
options for upward mobility, New York's Latino poverty rates were well above 
the national norm. Even the region's more prosperous Asians earned 1990 median 
household incomes nearly 3% less than the U.S. standard for their group. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Latino and Asian immigrants in California and Los Angeles County, 
which accounted for nearly all the region's nearly 1.4 million population 
increase in the 1980s, did not find a stagnant industrial base. Provided with 
substantial market, capital and employment opportunities, California's male 
Latinos had the highest labor-participation rates in the country. 
College-education rates for Asians and Latinos increased two to three times 
faster than for the state as a whole, and, by 1990, each group's median 
household incomes were 8% to 21% greater than comparable national figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, California's political elites, still panicked by the recession, 
are offering many of the same policies that crippled the nation's largest city. 
A powerful coalition of utilities, universities and national labs, defense 
companies and public-employee unions has all but convinced policy-makers on 
both sides of the political aisle that the state's economic future lies in 
fostering a high-tech wonderland of subsidized transportation or 
environmentally safe "green" industries. As in New York, such thriving 
industries as garments or textiles, employing hundreds of thousands and 
providing crucial entry-level jobs, are relentlessly regulated, taxed and and 
deprecated as offering only "lousy" jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 California's leadership also seems evenly split between two equally 
counterproductive views of the state's legal immigrants and resident ethnic 
groups as either welfare cheats or an exploited underclass in need of a huge 
extension of welfare benefits. Although these views start from opposite ends of 
the political spectrum, they both encourage the same confrontational, 
tribalistic politics that helped destroy the New York economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Why pin California's economic future to perhaps the world's leading model of 
urban decline? Why not instead develop a political vision reflective of the 
state's rapidly changing economy and demographics? The key elements of such a 
vision would be a commitment to cultivate the private-sector economy as the 
centerpiece of wealth creation; to provide the necessary public resources to 
all groups who act consistent with this goal; to cut government where public 
activities are counterproductive to quality private-sector expansion, and to 
collectively deal with the truly dispossessed who cannot help themselves in the 
private economy. 
</P>
<P>
 This is precisely the progressive, economically vital political agenda that 
New York's elite, even after years of grinding failure, has been utterly unable 
to articulate. True, no one in California has yet proved up to the task. But 
the possibility that the state will generate leaders with the will to foster 
growth and opportunity, rather than the decline and stagnation that seems New 
York's tragic legacy, still remains the promise of California.*

ON U.S. HUMAN-RIGHTS ISSUE, CHINA WAS NOT FIRST BLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles William Maynes, Charles William Maynes is the editor of Foreign 
Policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton's recent reversal of the U.S. position on human rights in China 
was not his Administration's first blow against human rights. Long before the 
debate about most- favored-nation treatment for China began to escalate, the 
Administration's human-rights agenda had suffered two powerful blows. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was the decision to choose Boris N. Yeltsin over the Russian 
Parliament -- even to the point of applauding the decision to fire on the 
Russian White House. In a democratic system, laws and institutions must take 
precedence over individuals in temporary advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration, repeating the mistake of the Bush 
Administration, was determined to promote the fortunes of a single man rather 
than undertake the more difficult, long-term task of promoting democratic 
institutions. This decision, of course, backfired on the Administration 
tragically when the Russian people elected a Parliament worse than the one 
Yeltsin had bombed.  
</P>
<P>
 Another disturbing sign is the Administration's new timid position on U.N. 
peacekeeping. Stung by its own mismanagement of U.S. involvement in Somalia, 
the Administration began to retreat from the position that the United States 
should use its power for humanitarian goals through the United Nations. 
Instead, it began to pronounce a new doctrine of national interest, under which 
Washington would neither participate in nor finance U.N. peacekeeping 
operations unless clear U.S. national interests were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been almost no public debate about the significance of this shift. 
The fundamental understanding on which the United Nations is based is that 
permanent members of the Security Council have global responsibilities, 
reaching beyond the narrowest definition of national interest. If they do not 
accept those responsibilities, there is no justification for a country like the 
United States to have a permanent seat on the Security Council and a veto over 
U.N. actions in the fields of peace and security. By adopting this new 
position, the Clinton Administration may have begun the process of 
de-legitimizing the privileged role the United States has enjoyed in the 
international system since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage, then, has been done to the cause of human rights in the last few 
years. The Administration says the right things but it takes decisions that 
undermine the goals it says it is pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Was there an alternative route? In fairness, Congress and the media should 
admit they were cheering the decision to support Yeltsin to the hilt. And the 
same Congress and media that pressed the Bush Administration to enter Somalia 
for the pursuit of humanitarian goals was denouncing the Clinton Administration 
for not getting U.S. troops out earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is no denying that a strong moral argument can be made that the 
Administration's decision to concentrate on domestic problems is correct after 
the exertions of the Cold War. Our only compensation is that things are far 
worse in the land of our former antagonists. But the issue is one of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 One should also acknowledge that, unlike George Bush, Clinton has had the 
misfortune to be in office when the realities of the post-Cold War world are 
beginning to dawn on most Americans. When the Berlin Wall came down, the Warsaw 
Pact disappeared and the Soviet Union disintegrated, many Americans believed 
Washington could run the world. 
</P>
<P>
 On columnist announced the arrival of "the unipolar moment" -- when the United 
States could tell the world how to govern itself. He was not the only one. 
During the presidential campaign, both Bush and Clinton joined him. Clinton 
called on America to "lead a global alliance for democracy as united and 
steadfast as the global alliance that defeated communism." Bush called for a 
new world order "where the strong protect the weak (and) where people are 
governed by the rule of law and not by the tyranny of despots." 
</P>
<P>
 What both men, and the country, did not realize is that the willingness of 
other states to follow U.S. leadership on controversial issues like democracy 
or human rights was related to their dependence on Washington to stand up to 
the Soviets. When that was no longer necessary, other countries felt freer to 
defy not only the United States but other powers. 
</P>
<P>
 A symbol of this new world order is tiny Singapore's decision to reject 
Clinton's request that an 18-year-old American convicted of vandalism not be 
flogged. Does this mean that U.S. power can no longer serve the cause of human 
rights? Not at all. But Washington policy-makers are going to have to be more 
cautious in their actions and more controlled in their rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 But in one respect, U.S. human-rights policy has been a spectacular success: 
The issue is now on the international agenda. Most governments are responsive, 
to some degree, to international concern and criticism. Even in the midst of a 
bitter civil war in Bosnia, combatants allowed international observers into 
their POW camps when inhumane conditions were exposed. China has not lived up 
to international demands for human-rights reform, but it has also not been 
unresponsive to international criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Because U.S. policy has been successful, there is hope that the decline in 
U.S. leverage will be offset at least in part by rising international 
involvement. Non-governmental organizations have developed a far greater voice 
in human rights over the last 20 years. These organizations can be encouraged 
and better financed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source of hope is the growing tendency of international financial 
organizations to take human-rights considerations into account when offering 
help. It is increasingly being recognized that a poorly run polity is unlikely 
to have a well-run economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship is not one to one -- too many successful authoritarian states 
in Asia demonstrate otherwise. But even here, growing respect for human rights 
is one aspect of their success. China is repressive, but compared with 
conditions under the Cultural Revolution, it has become a free country and the 
improved political conditions have been attributed to its spectacular economic 
success. Americans have to believe that China's further development will 
continue to open up that critical country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, progress in human rights will be uneven. We will have more 
leverage on some countries than others. There will be serious setbacks -- 
particularly during civil wars, when almost all restraint seems to disappear. 
But among established governments the direction of progress seems clear. 
Overall, the trend is toward greater respect, not less for the values that 
Americans hold dear.*

THE NATION; THE LAST POPULIST: ED EDWARDS' GRACEFUL GOODBY TO LOUISIANA 
POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Maginnis, John Maginnis, the editor of the Louisiana Political Review, 
is author of two books on Louisiana politics, including The Last Hayride. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of a long day working the Strawberry Festival in the 1991 Louisiana 
governor's race, Edwin W. Edwards paused outside the little house he shared 
with his girlfriend and reflected on his political destiny: "Probably the best 
thing that can happen to me is to get elected and to die the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 It took a bit longer, but that's about what happened as, last week, Edwards 
told a shocked Legislature he would not seek a fifth term. In 1995, for the 
first time in a quarter century, Louisianians will go to the polls without 
Edwards on the ballot or in the wings, pulling strings. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, Edwards was acknowledging the reality that he could not win again and 
that it's best to go out a non-loser. The voters, wracked by hard times and bad 
government, had grown tired and angry with the high-rolling Edwards act. The 
interesting part is that it's been that way for the past 10 years. Edwards only 
died this time after coming back from the dead, and cutting the last great deal 
that he wants to be remembered for. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards' reputation was made in the '70s, basking in popularity despite his 
open disdain for middle-class morality. He dressed loudly, gambled heavily, 
made flagrant passes at women and regularly flirted with scandal. He approached 
adultery like sales, saying, "Two out of 10 women will go to bed with you, but 
you've got to ask the other eight." He seemed reckless but was ever cautious of 
not stepping over that line between legal and illegal. Right and wrong was 
someone else's hang-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards once bragged in an election he could only be beaten, "if I get caught 
in bed with a dead girl or a live boy." He was right -- and reelected. Not just 
because he was entertaining and reflected the casual mores of his constituents, 
but also because he maintained a something-for-nothing contract with the people 
that kept populism alive in Louisiana long after it had died out everywhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret was spending "Other People's Money" -- not his people's. Gov. Huey 
P. Long wrote the script by levying the first big tax on the oil companies to 
build roads and bridges where only dirt lanes and ferries had gone before. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards took oil populism to a new level, changing the severance tax from 
pennies on the barrel to a percentage, just before the Arab embargo and the 
quadrupling of oil prices. The money flowed in -- and right back out again, 
into highways, hospitals, contracts for friends and many, many new state 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 As California was going through a tax revolt, Louisiana was choking in dough 
-- but not from the people's pockets. Property taxes were, and remain, among 
the nation's lowest -- 90% of Louisiana homeowners pay none. Government was not 
something people invested in and expected a return from; it was a sideshow they 
weren't paying for and could laugh at. 
</P>
<P>
 The laughing, with the oil boom, stopped in the early '80s -- just as Edwards 
completed his first comeback for a third term. He promised the good times would 
roll again, but with oil revenues diving, he had to ask the people to pay for 
it. And they got surly. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was that problem of the line of the law. A U.S. attorney charged 
that Edwards had stepped over it in making a million dollars dealing in 
hospital permits as a private citizen. On trial, the governor kept up a brave, 
funny front. He arrived one day in a horse-drawn carriage, to make a point 
about the pace of the government's case. He even made a pass at a young woman 
in the courtroom, only to learn she was the judge's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony was not as funny. A Las Vegas casino official testified that he 
collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in gambling debts from Edwards, once 
going to the governor's mansion to receive a suitcase stuffed with cash. It 
didn't go down well in a state with double-digit unemployment and 25% of its 
citizens below the poverty line.  
</P>
<P>
 Edwards' popularity plummeted. His one grand scheme to bring back Other 
People's Money -- to build a giant casino in New Orleans -- was buried in the 
distrust and disgust of an electorate turned against him. Counter to his own 
better judgment, he ran for a fourth term, but dropped out when he trailed 
angry reformer Charles E. (Buddy) Roemer in the 1987 open primary. In a 
political obituary, one writer concluded that Edwards could never be elected 
again, "unless he runs against Adolf Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
 David Duke, a far-right extremist, would do. The 1991 election had little to 
do with Edwards, but he was the beneficiary of a conservative jihad between 
Roemer and Duke, which Duke won, only to be crushed by Edwards in the runoff. 
It's not like the people had much choice. Edwards even joked about the 
one-armed man who said he would not vote because he could not pull the lever 
and hold his nose at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana made a mistake in not listening to Edwards the first time -- when he 
wanted to build the big casino in New Orleans in 1986. Had it done so, the 
state would have a well-developed gaming industry; would be past the first wave 
of indictments and trials, and Biloxi would not be the booming new mecca of 
chance. But that's what second, or fourth, chances are all about. Edwards spent 
his last political capital, and then some, to push through a casino bill in 
1992. He had brought back Other People's Money to help close the budget deficit 
and create the service jobs his base constituents would gladly fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory was bittersweet. Voters, once they figured it out, were incensed that 
they could not vote on the casino. His negative ratings shot back to the high 
50s and froze there. His children were investigated for promoting business 
deals with riverboat casinos. Though they were cleared, for Edwards it was 
absurd that his no-good friends could make legal millions from gambling 
licenses but his son couldn't sell a juice dispenser to a riverboat. Yet, with 
no indictments and a healthy, diversified economy, his fourth term has not been 
a bad one, graded on the curve. But he stayed too long, and then came back and 
stayed some more. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the real turning point came early this year, when he fell from his 
horse and suffered a broken bone in his back. Recuperation was long, causing 
the 66-year-old to reflect on how life was short. The first shoe fell in May, 
when he married his 29-year-old girlfriend, Candy, in an unannounced ceremony. 
Fresh from his honeymoon, he dropped the bomb -- he would not run again. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last 18 months in office, he can point to a record of renewed populism, 
of using Other People's Money to take care of his own -- especially his 
friends. His world's largest casino will be built, and likely will be a winner 
long after legalized gambling spreads coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The end comes gracefully to those who have been through it before. Edwards 
could have stayed gone the first time voters ran him off. But he had a legacy 
to leave and he would not be denied. With the truly gifted politicians, there 
are some powers that are not the people's.*

THE WORLD; BUT HOW WERE GERMANS VICTIMS OF NAZI AGGRESSION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald D. Feldman, Gerald D. Feldman, a professor of history, is director of 
the Center for German and European Studies at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the end of the Cold War, the Age of Anxiety seems to be over. Unhappily, 
though, the Age of Rubbish appears to have replaced it. One chief 
characteristic of this new age is the creation of oppor tunistic and 
self-serving historical concoctions, linkages and comparisons that obfuscate 
historical reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent exercise along these lines revolves around whether Germany 
should have been represented at the D-day commemorations. The argument goes 
that Germany, too, was "liberated" by the Allied armies, is now a full-fledged 
member of the Western Alliance and has come to be the kind of democracy for 
which the invading forces on the Normandy beachheads fought and died. As Susan 
Eisenhower and other American policy analysts have demonstrated, this position 
is not the exclusive property of some German politicians eager to drown the 
past in a sea of communal sentimentality on Omaha Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes such an appalling idea possible? The current craze for "victimhood" 
certainly has much to do with it. For understandable reasons, postwar Germans 
were prone to think of themselves as victims. Emphasizing their status as 
victims was probably a necessary way for Germans to cope with the unbearable 
regime of Adolf Hitler and the involvement of so many in its misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Generals could complain that they and their troops were victims of Hitler's 
megalomania and military incompetence. Businessmen could claim they were 
victims of the Nazi state's dominance of the economy and violations of the 
rules of economics. Doctors could claim they were victims of the regime's 
bizarre racial ideas and disdain for medical standards. Professors could claim 
they were victims of the Nazi takeover of the universities. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, there has been a growing literature inside and outside Germany 
on the plight of the millions of Germans expelled by the Czechs and Poles in 
ethnic cleansing that took place in the Sudetenland and parts of Germany taken 
over by Poland in 1945, the large number of rapes committed by Russian troops 
as they occupied Germany and the mistreatment of German POWs in 1945-1946. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, these are historical events that must not be neglected. But what 
gets lost in these waves of assaults on the beachhead of memory is the 
fundamental distinction between those who perpetrated the war, with its 
horrors, and those who were victims of Nazi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 German troops did not occupy most of Europe and cause millions of deaths by 
invitation, and the price paid by Germans must be seen in its real historical 
context. D-day was not intended to liberate Germany but rather Germany's 
victims. Its success probably saved Germany from being the victim of the first 
atomic bomb. Using the bomb would have appeared a welcome alternative to 
launching a second invasion. For that, we should all be thankful, just as we 
should be appreciative of Germany's extraordinary achievements since 1945 and 
its efforts to come to terms with its past. 
</P>
<P>
 D-day, however, was an Allied victory, and a post-modernist fog of 
free-wheeling "interpretation" should not be allowed to descend on it. The 
defeated German enemy soldiers of 1944 cannot be represented by the German 
friends of today as participants in our victory. As the late and great German 
historian Thomas Nipperdey argued, one should accord to history that which 
belongs to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The great battle on those beaches was not some noisy and regrettable way 
station on the road to the current happy state of affairs, and the German 
troops in Normandy were not greeting our assaulting troops with towels to dry 
up and Wurstchen . The Germans put up a ferocious resistance, and it is hard to 
imagine that any expected to return for a D-day commemoration a half-century 
later and celebrate with the men they were trying to drive back into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the battle was anything but certain. Gen. Omar N. Bradley 
actually thought the invasion was a failure during its initial phase. 
Furthermore, the success of the invasion in no way destroyed the morale of the 
German army, which fought with extraordinary tenacity for a terrible cause 
right through the Battle of the Bulge at the end of 1944. The German army was 
not at that time preparing itself for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Nazi Germany's political and military leaders even entertained the 
hope that the alliance between the Western powers and the Soviet Union would 
break up and there would be a joint effort against the Soviets. In fact, 
Germany's leaders still had plans for victory in 1944-1945. The Russians were 
not doing as well against the Germans in 1944 as they had in 1943, while the 
Germans had the benefit of a consolidated front in the East. The V-1 and V-2 
rockets were launched against England in the summer of 1944, and a new U-boat 
offensive was planned. The air war against Germany had failed to stop war 
production, and the Nazi leadership was ready to call up its last reserves. It 
is simply unhistorical, therefore, to talk about "liberating" Germany in 
1944-1945. There could only be one goal -- defeating Germany and imposing an 
unconditional surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of D-day, after all, opened the way not only to Paris and Berlin, 
but also to Dachau and the other sites of Nazi horror that the invading armies 
were to discover. Therefore, to speak of liberating Auschwitz and of liberating 
Germany in the same breath is blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
 The cynical notion of an alliance between Nazi Germany and the Western Allies 
against the Soviet Union was totally unrealistic -- not only because of the 
Allies common interest in preventing German domination of Europe, but also 
because of the vileness of the Nazi regime. It is precisely the character of 
the regime for which the German troops at Normandy fought that makes it 
impossible to engage in a joint celebration of the landing today. Normandy is 
not like battle of Verdun during World War I -- where hundreds of thousands of 
soldiers died as victims of a great historical rivalry now buried with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever its faults, the Germany that fought the First World War was no more 
like Nazi Germany than the Germany of today. And Germany today is not the 
product of a German victory over National Socialism but of an Allied victory 
over Nazi Germany. That is a historical reality that needs to be understood by 
Germans and by everyone else in assessing what can be and cannot be 
appropriately commemorated in common.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; ANTHONY BLAIR; THE FAIR-HAIRED BOY OF THE LABOR 
PARTY -- AND BRITAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Plate and William Tuohy, Thomas Plate is the editor of the editorial 
pages and William Tuohy is London bureau chief for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just across Parliament Square from the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben is a 
nondescript building of small, cramped offices. Among them is the office of 
Britain's Shadow Home Secretary. It is almost comically narrow and 
claustrophobic. But this is how Britain treats its opposition leaders -- which 
is why winning power here is everything. 
</P>
<P>
 For four consecutive national elections -- almost 16 years -- the Labor Party 
has been out of power. But now its supporters have hope, and the reason is 
Anthony Charles Lynton Blair, known to all as "Tony." At the young age of 41 -- 
and after only 11 years in Parliament -- the personable and articulate Blair 
appears the Labor's leading choice to become its next leader in the July 21 
balloting -- replacing John Smith, who died suddenly of a heart attack in May. 
</P>
<P>
 A Scot with an English accent, Blair attended a private school in Edinburgh, 
graduated from Oxford University and was elected to Parliament from the mining 
country in Durham. In 1984, barely 30, he became a member of Labor's "Shadow 
Cabinet." He and his wife, Cherie, a lawyer, have three children. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected party leader, Blair would be in position to be the next prime 
minister -- unless the persistently flagging fortunes of the Conservative Party 
under John Major improve markedly. Blair is the opposition party's leading 
"modernizer" -- intent on attracting not just working-class voters and 
intellectuals but mainstream Britons who ordinarily vote Conservative or 
Liberal Democrat. At least this is what supporters fervently hope -- that Blair 
is the man of the future whose centrist policies appeal to a wide spectrum. His 
opponents, however, say Blair is just a glamorous new face on the old Labor 
Party, with its militant leftist tendencies and scary collectivist policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even his most severe political critics take Blair seriously, knowing he 
may be the brightest young man in the opposition today, and the brightest Labor 
leader to appear in many a day. That man in the cramped office bodes to someday 
occupy a far grander space -- at No. 10 Downing Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: The impression one has of the Labor Party is that it's part and 
party to socialism, of nationalization of industry, of the large welfare state, 
with high taxation and lots of centralized government. Is this view wrong?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think that view is fairly out of date. The Labor Party -- in common 
with most left-of-center parties in the last 20 or 30 years in Europe -- has 
undergone a considerable amount of change. Not changing its basic principles 
but updating those principles for the modern world. The argument between public 
versus private sector is really a dead argument within the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialism is a word I know that has a particular meaning in the United States, 
(but) socialism to most of us within the Labor Party is a basic set of values, 
it's a view of society and the individual and the belief that individuals 
prosper best within a strong and cohesive society and community. And that value 
system is what the modern Labor Party is about rather than economic 
prescriptions that may have been fine for particular generations or have some 
historical connection with certain perspectives about socialism but don't 
really represent the Labor Party as it is today. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Bill Clinton moved his party to the center and won the election. Is it your 
view that the only sensible political ground these days is the middle?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think the governing ground need be the consensus of the lowest 
common denominator, and the least offensive to people. But we do have to break 
through some of the stereotypes around left and right. For example, it's 
interesting that people in the Soviet Union who are old statists and who want 
state control are regarded as right wing. Left wing, to me, means radical, and 
I think we do need a radical party, but it should be a radical party for 
today's world -- not the world of 40 or 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the great historical change this century . . . was the acknowledgment that 
as the state grew in power, so there were vested interests that could grow up 
around it that could be every bit as powerful and occasionally every bit as 
oppressive as the vested interests of capital. And, therefore, what we require 
for today's world is a notion of the public interest, society's interest as a 
whole, where you set certain key objectives in an attempt to fulfill them -- 
but don't have an ideological predisposition that they must be fulfilled by the 
public sector or the private sector. That notion of partnership -- of working 
together, public and private sector -- is much more where it's at for most 
left-of-center politics in Europe now. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your critics say your modern Labor politicians might make a good speech or 
have a good non-threatening image but break through that imagery and behind it 
you have the old burnt-out socialism.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yup, well, they would say that (laughing). No, what has burnt out, in the 
same way that 19th Century liberalism has burnt out, is the notion of socialism 
as a form of state control and ownership of everything. Socialism a la the 
Soviet Union -- yeah, that's burnt out. 
</P>
<P>
 But socialism, for most of my generation in the Labor Party, never meant that. 
What it meant was a set of values -- a basic set of beliefs. And there are two 
different types of beliefs in politics. One is a very strictly individualist 
view -- which is the sort of Thatcherite view; and one is a view that places 
the individual in the broader community, which is the social view of human 
beings . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, you can say that the huge ideological battles of the earlier part 
of the century -- the notion that there would be one governing ideology that 
took the world over, whether of right or left -- those days are gone. The right 
has had to accept the existence of public provision and public services, and 
the left has had to accept the existence of a market economy and enterprise. To 
that extent, there's been some coming together . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most extraordinary statistic of the Thatcher years is that, at the end of 
her reign, public spending, as a proportion of our national income, was higher 
than it was under our last Labor government. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you can draw one or two conclusions from that. You can either say she was 
a closet socialist -- which is unlikely; or you can say any modern society will 
have a significant public-welfare provision. The arguments should transfer much 
more toward what are the key objectives that we want to meet as a society, and 
how you rebuild social cohesion in our country, rather than focusing on whether 
it's public or private sector or some argument about the state versus the 
market -- which is an intellectually dead argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But is your party prepared to take the position that if the rate of 
taxation had been any greater under Thatcher, it would have had a stifling 
effect on the economy?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There's clearly got to be a balance struck there. But the great problem 
we've got with public spending in this country is the enormous bills for high 
unemployment. We are now living with a structural unemployment rate that is 8% 
to 10%. And that is massive, and that has huge social costs, and it has huge 
direct costs in terms of public expenditure. And one of the reasons why 
conservatives have had to put up taxes . . . is to pay the costs of economic 
and social failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme I have been developing is, in a sense, rebuilding this country as 
one nation, where people have a stake in our society, particularly young 
people, but where we are demanding respect and proper conduct in return. We 
should give chances and expect people to take them. It's a very important 
restatement of the left-of-center position -- that you believe in society, but 
that it's a two-way deal for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But isn't it religious leaders and educators who have the most legitimate 
role in building social cohesion?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, but government can assist the process, because its economic and 
social policies will either enable people to develop opportunity and 
self-reliance and enterprise, or occasionally they can stifle them. Or, simply 
by getting government out of everything and just leaving the market to rule, 
they can allow those who can do well to do well and, therefore, those who are 
deprived of the opportunities not to do well; and we just waste a lot of our 
talent and ability. We have 1 million people here under the age of 25 out of 
work. For us, that's a helluva lot of people. Yet, we're surprised at the crime 
and drug scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason why Labor has not been in power for 15 years or more is that, first 
of all, it took some really wrong turnings in the early 1980s. But then when it 
changed . . . it was never clear that it had changed and why it changed . . . . 
We weren't explaining it to people in terms of our basic values and principles 
. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You take the issue of crime. The issue of crime has just been sitting there as 
. . . a Labor Party issue for years, and we felt difficult about talking about 
it. There was a very strong civil-liberties lobby and that's fine -- the civil 
liberties of people are very important. But we had allowed ourselves as being 
perceived as people who were more interested in the civil liberties of people 
accused of crime than the civil liberties of those getting their houses broken 
into and beaten up and mugged in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Now crime is a Labor Party issue. Why? Because it's the poorest, most 
vulnerable, most disadvantaged people in society that suffer from it. It's not 
people who can afford to put 10-foot perimeter walls around their houses and 
have the latest burglar alarm installed; it's some poor woman living in the 
inner city . . . and when she goes down the stairs of her council house, she 
gets mugged. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, if we're the party that represents those people, then we represent 
those people by talking about crime and having policies about crime that are 
tough on crime and are tough on the causes of crime. We don't ignore those 
social causes about crime, but we don't start excusing people from 
responsibility when they commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Britain has always been America's closest ally. But, right now, the two 
seem to be having problems with their foreign policy. How would a Labor 
government improve this?  
</P>
<P>
 A: If Britain could get its relationship with Europe sorted out properly, then 
I think it could then act in a central mode toward developing a better 
understanding between America and Europe. My appreciation of Britain's 
relationship with the United States is that there are tremendous sentimental 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm struck everytime I am in Washington that if you come over as a dignitary 
of the European Community, then people really want to get to grips with what 
you are saying. But if you come from Britain . . . then there is this great 
fund of emotion, and all the rest of it, but people are aware that Britain in 
Europe is a stronger thing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 (Fortunately) Labor has a clear position with regard to Europe. And, on the 
whole, with certain exceptions, because it is a pretty big issue, the party is 
united . . . . The party favors cooperation within Europe. And, I think, too, 
that, with the Clinton Administration, there will be clear ties between the two 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Given the activist press, what will happen to your privacy if you find 
yourself in high office? Have you begun reconciling yourself to that?

 A: Well, I've certainly had a taste of it over the past couple of weeks. It's 
a very difficult issue, because I think, in the end, the public needs to ask 
itself what it wants of its politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 From over here, when you look across the water and see what is happening to 
Clinton, you do wonder what politics is supposed to be about. Whether he is a 
good President or not does not, in any way, appear to be connected to what most 
of which we appear to read about. And there's got to be some fairly open debate 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Politicians use the media, so they can't really complain when the media 
comes after them. And this is the love-hate relationship between the media and 
politicians that always exists. But what does have to happen . . . in terms of 
an understanding is how politics can work if it is to be feasible and in the 
interests of the public, there has to be some sense of where the boundaries are 
. . . . Given the nature of the press, (you have to be aware) of the fickleness 
with which they treat politicians. If I was in any doubt, I could always cross 
the Atlantic . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have to be a saint to be prime minister?  
</P>
<P>
 A: If you do have to be a saint, you won't get a prime minister. What you'll 
get is a prime minister who is a liar.*

POWERFUL NEW IDEA FOR ELECTRIC POWER?; STATE LOOKS TO DEREGULATION OF ELECTRIC 
UTILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California may become a national trendsetter yet again. It may change the way 
you buy power for everything from a hair dryer to heavy factory equipment. The 
move has big implications for residents and businesses both here and elsewhere. 
But will California do the job right? 
</P>
<P>
 The state Public Utilities Commission is calling for deregulation of electric 
utilities, a proposal being watched closely by at least a dozen other states 
interested in deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving with surprising -- some critics would say worrisome -- speed after a 
yearlong study, the PUC issued proposals in April aimed at substituting market 
forces for the traditional state regulation of electric utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, most industrial and commercial electric customers have little 
choice but to purchase their power from the local utility, either a municipally 
owned system like Los Angeles' Department of Water & Power or one of the big 
three investor-owned utilities in California -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co., 
Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. Residential 
customers have no choice. The PUC proposal would free all customers of the 
private utilities to buy electricity from any source. Beginning two years from 
now, major commercial and industrial users would be able to buy from 
independent producers. Residential users would be able to do the same starting 
in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, deregulation should reduce electricity rates (California's are 
typically 50% above the national average) by putting new competitive market 
pressures on the big three private utilities. The ultimate goal is a more 
business-friendly and competitive California. But before it can go into effect 
this sweeping proposal will be subject to extensive review, criticism and 
revision. The PUC begins hearings this week, with the aim of deciding on 
deregulation by August. 
</P>
<P>
 That deadline is troubling. The PUC should take all the time it needs on this 
complex issue. After all, it is out to dismantle monopolies it has helped to 
protect since 1912. The PUC is an autonomous state unit under the state 
Constitution and has long had a reputation for siding with electric suppliers 
over consumers. That has raised concern over whether the PUC is even the right 
entity to oversee deregulation. Significantly, the U.S. Department of Energy is 
among the worried parties. It contends that the PUC is using a flawed legal 
strategy and that challenges to the PUC approach might keep any agreed-on plan 
tied up in the courts for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, judging by the first round of written comments, submitted to the PUC 
last Wednesday, there's certainly no consensus now on how to go about 
deregulation -- even though electricity producers, customers and 
environmentalists all say they want cost-cutting competition. The utilities 
differ on how to phase in a program. Consumers groups demand equitable 
treatment for residential customers. Environmentalists worry that wide-open 
competition would weaken the state's long commitment to renewable energy 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The deregulation hearings merit close public attention. A new way to buy 
electricity represents a sweeping change for all of California's homes and 
businesses. Doing it right could light the way for other states to follow. 
Doing it badly could hinder California's economic revival.

SEEKING A CURE FOR AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The AIDS Cure Act to establish the AIDS Cure Project, HR 4370, to which you 
alluded in your May 31 editorial is neither a speedy nor narrow approach to 
finding a cure for AIDS. Rather, it is a reasoned and focused plan written by 
ACT UP/New York that would put passion and creativity back into research. It is 
supported not only by activist groups such as ACT UP/Los Angeles locally but 
also by city councils, service organizations, politicians, individuals, and ACT 
UP chapters nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 It is irresponsible if not deadly for you to editorialize for serendipitous 
research when after 13 years of unfocused research there is no cure for AIDS 
and no effective treatment for HIV, if, indeed, HIV is the sole cause of AIDS. 
As a person with AIDS, I can't afford the luxury of waiting for accidental 
discoveries of treatments or curatives. With more than 200,000 dead from AIDS 
in the United States alone, how many more have to die before you stop 
dismissing the demands of AIDS activists that the government act responsibly 
and swiftly to end the suffering and deaths from AIDS? 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial is misleading in two ways. First, you suggest that the 
government and pharmaceutical companies have been in an earnest but failed 
pursuit to find a cure for AIDS. Profit, career advancement and fame have been 
the prime motivations for researchers, not a cure. The AIDS Cure Project would 
be separate from the drug industry-dominated National Institutes of Health to 
avoid the obvious conflicts of interest. Second, you credit activists with a 
legitimate outrage but then imply they are to blame for ineffective drugs such 
as AZT. While AIDS activists could perhaps be accused of being overly zealous 
and acting in poor taste occasionally, their accomplishments in improving the 
lives of people with AIDS cannot be ignored and they are in no way accountable 
for scientific or governmental failure.  
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS Cure Project calls not for a speedy cure but expanded research into 
the basic pathogenesis of AIDS and the study of people with AIDS, not just a 
virus. Its ultimate goal is a cure that will be available to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Bernard N. Fields, Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman and especially Dr. William 
Paul, new director of the Office of AIDS Research at the NIH, are not offering 
anything new to AIDS research. What they are trying to do is deflect criticism 
of their failures and to silence AIDS activists who are relentless in their 
demands to doctors, scientists and governmental officials to do something about 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 We do need a new beginning on AIDS, and the AIDS Cure Act is that 
commencement. Read it. Question it. Demand it.

OLIVER NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As one who has been an active, enthusiastic Republican for over 35 years, I 
have always taken considerable pride in our party's positions of law and order, 
patriotism and personal responsibility. The fact that most GOP politicians rank 
high in "character" has added to the esteem with which I have held my 
party.However, my love affair with the GOP suffered a severe jolt on June 4 
when Republican delegates in the great state of Virginia saw fit to nominate 
Oliver North for a seat in the United States Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 For it was North, driven by a perverted, arrogant sense of "patriotism," who 
worked to circumvent the will of the American electorate -- as reflected by 
members of the U.S. Congress -- in favor of his own political views. Such utter 
contempt for the Constitution must be rejected by all responsible citizens, 
irrespective of their views about Congress. 
</P>

 * I don't know how much longer I can call myself a Republican. I'm disgusted 
with the likes of Sens. John W. Warner (R-Va.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), who 
won't endorse the candidacy of Oliver North for Senate.  
</P>
<P>
 North won the nomination fair and square, utilizing the democratic process. 
What is the problem with these so-called Republican leaders that they won't 
respect the wishes of their own party? 
</P>
<P>
 These senators don't seem to have the same beliefs that I do, enunciated so 
well by North. When are they going to realize that their brand of Republicanism 
is out of step with those of us in "the hinterlands," defined as anything 
outside the Beltway?

OVERHAUL FOR JUVENILE CRIME NETWORK; UNDER ASSEMBLY BILL, MANY AGENCIES WOULD 
JOIN IN A REVIEW OF THE OVERWHELMED SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That crime committed by teen-agers and young adults has escalated sharply in 
recent years -- and has become dramatically more violent -- is a given. 
Nationally and in California, the arrest rate of teen-agers for murder more 
than doubled from 1982 to 1992. In some areas, juvenile homicides increased as 
much as fivefold. More than 1,000 young murderers are now housed in California 
Youth Authority institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps less obvious is that the social and criminal justice agencies 
created to handle juveniles are now overwhelmed with serious crimes. 
Authorities once responded to truancy and promiscuity because they considered 
such relatively minor problems as harbingers of much more serious youthful 
delinquency; now these authorities must increasingly focus their scarce 
resources on a growing number of violent felons. Those who commit misdemeanors 
or troubled boys and girls simply "at risk" of crime or dropping out of school 
can fall through the cracks.  
</P>
<P>
 In the face of all this, overhaul of what has become a rather antiquated and 
increasingly inadequate patchwork of juvenile laws and agencies is called for. 
Several other states, including New York, Arizona and Colorado, have embarked 
on such efforts. California too should do so -- and quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 AB 2428, introduced by Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos), would create a task 
force to review juvenile crime and the response of state and local agencies 
responsible for juvenile offenders. The task force would bring in all the 
relevant agencies; representatives would be sent by sheriffs, police 
departments, probation officials, district attorneys, social services, schools, 
juvenile courts, youth authorities, the attorney general and defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force's goal would be to review all aspects of juvenile law, and the 
panel would ask which laws and practices should be changed and which should be 
retained. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, should young murderers receive tougher sentences than they now 
do? Under what circumstances should confidentiality of juvenile records be 
maintained? For which crimes? Which programs, in California or other states, 
have proven most successful in reducing juvenile recidivism?  
</P>
<P>
 The commission should provide the Legislature with a coherent agenda for 
reform. Epple's bill has already passed the Assembly and faces a Senate 
committee test this week. There is no organized opposition to this modest but 
constructive proposal. It's certainly worth a try.

CHILD SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Deadbeat Parents Plan Expanded" (May 15) spotlighted an enormously 
successful program worthy of your readers' attention. Our joint pilot effort 
with the Franchise Tax Board to collect delinquent child support has already 
resulted in more than $10 million of additional collections, benefiting both 
families and taxpayers in Los Angeles County.The success of the pilot points up 
the need to update collection remedies. 
</P>
<P>
 While I laud the attention your front-page article gives to this important 
social problem, I want to emphasize a point that is often lost in discussions 
of child support: Not every parent who pays support to the district attorney's 
office is a "deadbeat." Because our services are available at no cost to the 
public, many parents (mostly fathers) who pay child support through our system 
do so regularly and willingly. They love their children and want to do all that 
they can for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, it is painting with too broad a brush to describe all parents who are 
behind in their court orders as "deadbeats." As our recently inaugurated 
"Parents' Fair Share" project has demonstrated in other sites across the 
country, many parents who want to pay support lack employment or basic job 
skills to adequately take care of their children. We must find ways to promote 
and encourage economic responsibility on the part of parents. We can begin by 
accepting the proposition that name calling is not the best way to get parents 
to do the right thing.

COYOTE TRAPPING POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Policy Only a Coyote Could Love," editorial, June 2: 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sad day when The Times takes on the mentality of a selfish homeowner 
on the issue of animal regulation. The Times feels that coyotes are a danger 
when they have strayed into a residential area. But the fact is that it is 
people who are "straying" into the habitats of the coyotes. As long as there 
are greedy developers anxious to capitalize on "open" land, there will be 
idiots who insist on moving into these areas regardless of the fact that 
they're moving into the homes of wild animals, such as coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 What The Times refers to as "gobbledygook" is, in this reader's view, a 
welcome step to discouraging the random killing of innocent wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The steps that the Animal Regulation Commission is requiring homeowners to 
take are reasonable. The people should be accommodating the wildlife, not the 
other way around. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial regarding the city's policy on trapping coyotes made me 
smile. It's good to see this ancient, much-maligned creature get a break. 
</P>
<P>
 The biological history of human beings is that we are the only animals to 
invade the ecological niches belonging to other species and then systematically 
eliminate them as we take over that niche. We have done this tens of thousands 
of times. 
</P>
<P>
 After we invade, we declare the original occupants the "problem." For once, we 
need to sit back and realize that the solution just might be finding a point of 
gracious restraint where we do not try to consume everything, own everything 
and destroy everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The very name "coyote" comes from the Uto-Aztec language. That's how far back 
this old character goes. In an age where we agonize over saving the condor, 
can't we find an intelligent way to coexist with this surviving original 
inhabitant? 
</P>
<P>
 RICK DUNKERLY 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * For the better part of a year, we have been pleading with the Animal 
Regulation Commission, the mayor and our council members to deal, once and for 
all, with the dangers our children, pets and property face from a burgeoning 
coyote population that, in the absence of limited trapping, no longer fears 
human contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of relief, we have a series of impossible bureaucratic hurdles thrown 
at us along with cries of budgetary poverty from a department that can't afford 
to provide limited trapping, but can afford to buy eight new pickup trucks 
equipped with AM-FM stereo with rear speakers, presumably for the listening 
pleasure of stray animals. 
</P>
<P>
 We are living in fear. Not only in the hillsides, but also in the flats. Not 
only in our back yards, but city streets as well. Limited trapping as it was 
practiced before the ban was a measured and cost-effective method of largely 
stemming the problem. L.A. County understands this reality. Why can't the 
commission, the mayor and City Council?

UCLA'S ROTC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of life's choices and avenues foster uniqueness and individuality. The 
military and ROTC do not.Cohesiveness and cooperation demand conformity and 
uniformity -- hence, the precision drills, marching in lines, the haircuts and 
uniforms. This environment is not the place for heterosexuals or homosexuals, 
to demand their freedom to "let me be me." 
</P>
<P>
 The military Establishment justly and fairly discriminates against anyone who 
"stands out" from the troops. No sign reads "Gays need not apply." ROTC has one 
consistent high standard: "Sore thumbs" of any kind not welcome here.

PERSPECTIVE ON GAY RIGHTS; THERE ARE VICTORIES TO BE SAVORED; THE STRUGGLE FOR 
EQUALITY CONTINUES, BUT THE ANNIVERSARY OF STONEWALL IS ALSO A TIME TO REFLECT 
ON 25 YEARS OF PROGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER M. NARDI, Peter M. Nardi is professor of sociology at Pitzer College 
and co-author (with David Sanders and Judd Marmor) of Growing Up Before 
Stonewall: Life Stories of Some Gay Men (Routledge, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Through the month of June, in most major cities around the nation (today in 
Los Angeles), hundreds of thousands of lesbians and gay men will commemorate 25 
years of resistance and struggle against those who wish to deny us equal 
rights. The culminating event, a demonstration surrounding the United Nations 
building in New York on June 26, will remind those in power around the world 
that basic freedoms and dignity are still denied to gay men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 However, change has indeed occurred since patrons of the Stonewall Inn took to 
the streets of Sheridan Square in New York City around 1 a.m. on June 28, 1969, 
to protest a seemingly routine police raid of yet another gay bar. That night, 
those inside and outside the bar resisted; for several days afterward, they 
protested their treatment and began to organize to change a society that had 
made their very lives illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 While there were incidents of resistance before Stonewall, including a protest 
in Los Angeles after police shut down the Black Cat bar in Silver Lake in 1967 
-- the demonstrations and rebellion at the Stonewall Inn have become a 
political metaphor for the modern gay-liberation movement. Yes, we have seen 
new attempts to deny equal rights to lesbians and gay men, from the state of 
Colorado to small towns in Oregon. But that does not diminish the many 
achievements of the struggle against discrimination during the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, 25 years ago there were no policies, laws or ordinances 
prohibiting discrimination against lesbians and gay men. Today, eight states 
(Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont, 
California, Minnesota), the District of Columbia and more than 100 
municipalities and counties have enacted legislation making it illegal to 
discriminate in employment, public accommodation and housing on the basis of 
sexual orientation. In addition, the governors of New Mexico, New York, Ohio, 
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington have issued executive orders 
banning discrimination in public employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, lesbian and gay relationships were not recognized and 
the concept of "domestic partner" had yet to be heard. Today, numerous 
municipal governments (including Laguna Beach, West Hollywood, Berkeley, San 
Francisco, Seattle and Cambridge, Mass.), dozens of private universities and 
colleges (including the Claremont Colleges, Stanford and the University of 
Chicago) and many private corporations (including Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, 
MCA/Universal, Levi Strauss and Lotus Development) have extended various 
benefits to the partners of gay employees. Recognizing the relationships of gay 
men and lesbians as families has occurred in the highest court in New York 
state, in custody cases throughout the country and in second-parent adoption 
rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, 49 states had sodomy laws (Illinois having repealed its 
in 1961); today 23 states still have such laws, 17 of which apply to both 
homosexual and heterosexual sexual acts. This is a far cry from the days when 
the death penalty was enacted against sodomites in 1610 by the Virginia Colony. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, there were no hate-crime laws that included sexual 
orientation. Today, 20 states, about a dozen cities and counties and the 
District of Columbia have hate-crimes legislation that includes sexual 
orientation. And in 1990, the federal hate crime statistics bill was enacted 
requiring the collection of data on hate crimes to include those related to 
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 These are important steps in the struggle against discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are serious obstacles yet to be overcome. Since 1974, yearly 
attempts to add sexual orientation to the federal Civil Rights Act have failed 
to get out of committee, thus allowing many private institutions to deny equal 
rights to gay men and lesbians, as the firing of gay employees by the Cracker 
Barrel restaurant chain has unfortunately illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven states are considering proposals, similar to the one ruled 
unconstitutional in Colorado, that would remove housing and employment 
protection for lesbians and gay men. And many court battles involving child 
custody, domestic-partner benefits and inheritances; hate crimes, and 
employment discrimination show how lesbians and gay men continue to be targets 
of special discrimination.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet we need to celebrate our victories and acknowledge the many ways our lives 
have been changed with the help of those men and women who firmly believe in 
equal treatment under the law and who valiantly defied the forces of repression 
over the decades. Thank you to the resisters of Stonewall.

COLUMN LEFT/ HARRY BERNSTEIN: GETTING THE TEAMSTERS' HOUSE IN ORDER; RON CAREY, 
THE BELEAGUERED REFORMER, FIGHTS THE OLD GUARD THREATENED BY LOSS OF PERKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN, Harry Bernstein was for many years The Times' labor writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teamsters union President Ron Carey won a significant battle last Thursday in 
one of the most bitter internal union struggles since the fight against 
communist influence in the labor movement more than four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle over communism is now just a vague memory, but the ugly civil war 
for control of the 1.4-million-member Teamsters union is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey's victory came when the union executive board voted to abolish the 
union's four regional conferences, or divisions, that have been centers of 
furious opposition from old-guard Teamsters seeking to regain the presidency 
Carey won more than two years ago in the union's first-ever nationwide 
secret-ballot election. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey and his allies in the leadership won election as reformists pledged to 
eliminate all vestiges of corruption and waste that have plagued the nation's 
largest private-sector union for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an honest election supervised by a government-appointed monitor, 
Michael Holland. Other government-appointed investigators and prosecutors 
kicked out mobsters and mob-linked officials who had dominated the top echelon 
of the union since they infiltrated it in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all officers tied to the underworld are gone, but those who tolerated 
mobsters in top offices are fuming because Carey and his reformists are shaking 
up longstanding procedures and appointing what the old guard says are 
inexperienced men and women to staff jobs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey has been breaking up an "old boy" network that often won good union 
contracts for members but curbed democracy in the union and gave its officials 
lavish salaries and expense accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers of the four union divisions are spending about $14 million a year on 
work that Carey insists can be done by lower-level units of the union or by 
officers and staff in the national headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the heads of the four conferences was defeated for a top national post 
in the election Carey won, but they still hold other well-paying jobs in the 
union at local or regional levels. And they and their supporters are determined 
to continue fighting Carey inside the union and through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The international union's constitution is pretty clear about the power of the 
executive board to abolish the four conferences, which are only arms of the 
international union; but the continued internal fighting can only weaken the 
union, and so far there seems to be no attempt to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing the power that comes with running the conferences, which help manage 
local unions, is just one cause of the almost desperate battle conference 
leaders waged to keep them. Another is money. 
</P>
<P>
 One example, and not untypical, is the income of Michael J. Riley, chairman of 
the Western Conference of Teamsters, who, like others who lost the latest 
battle with Carey, draws multiple salaries from the union. Riley was getting a 
salary from his job as president of his local union in Los Angeles, another as 
head of the Southern California Joint Council 42, plus $187,000 as head of 
Western Conference, for a total of more than $300,000 a year, according to 
Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how much time he spent on the job to justify three salaries plus 
expenses, Riley told the executive board that he has three full-time jobs and 
works "14 to 15 hours a day, seven days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 He also insisted that last year he dropped his $29,073-a-year salary from his 
Los Angeles local union, adding that "if you're looking for greed, you got the 
wrong guy because I could be making $360,000 instead of $250,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, by Carey's standards that is still greed, since it doesn't include 
expenses. But Riley and others like him in the union are pikers when their pay 
is compared with the income of corporate executives, which runs into the 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley's duties are as extensive as most corporate executives since he is, in 
effect, CEO of about 400,000 Teamsters. And while corporate-executive salaries 
are outrageously high, Riley represents workers, not shareholders; his members 
did not approve his various salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, Carey appears to be winning the internal warfare, but the Teamsters 
need to put an end to it by getting both sides together to negotiate a peace 
treaty. Then, they need to get back to the business of helping the union's 
hard-working members.

HIV -- STILL THE NO. 1 SUSPECT BY FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Science advances in strange ways. Within the lifetime of many reading these 
words, the notion that the continents have migrated around the globe was 
considered scientifically risible. Today, the once-heretical concepts of 
continental drift and plate tectonics form the prevailing paradigm of modern 
geology, the explanation for why California is what it is, geologically 
speaking at least. 
</P>
<P>
 So, though unlikely, the notion that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
does not cause AIDS at least merits discussion, if only to rule it out. The 
question has turned a normally obscure scientific meeting scheduled for San 
Francisco this month into something of a dilemma for those devoted both to free 
scientific inquiry and to the public health. 
</P>
<P>
 An HIV skeptic, Charles Geshekter, an economic historian of Africa at CSU 
Chico, organized an AIDS panel for the annual meeting of the Pacific division 
of the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science. He invited 10 other 
skeptics to speak at a June 21 session. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that the panel was stacked, and responding to worries of the 
California Department of Public Health, the regional and national leaders of 
the AAAS insisted on adding four speakers who adhere to the overwhelming 
majority view of researchers that HIV infection compromises the immune system 
and unleashes AIDS. (They acted rather clumsily; Geshekter says he learned of 
these concerns and the program additions only by reading the press.) 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge to HIV has incubated in the dark vacuum of ignorance about the 
cause and spread of AIDS. Ten years after the virus was identified, no cure, 
truly effective therapy or vaccine is in sight. The mechanism of its 
destruction is not understood. And an AIDS research Establishment that has 
often appeared to be more interested in acclaim and money than cures and 
compassion has not helped. 
</P>
<P>
 One skeptic, Peter Duesberg, a UC Berkeley cell biologist who is on the June 
21 panel, argues that HIV is a "harmless virus" and that AIDS may be a 
non-infectious condition caused by long-term use of recreational drugs among 
homosexuals in America and Europe. African AIDS, he argues, is a separate 
epidemic caused by malnutrition, parasites and poor sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Such notions are rejected by nearly all leading AIDS researchers and 
clinicians. They fear that people will let down their guard against the blood- 
and semen-borne virus. Already, there are reports that many homosexuals are 
dropping safe sex habits, out of fatalism, survivor guilt or youthful abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of science shows gadflies and heretics have been essential to 
eroding long-accepted erroneous constructs. But discord over HIV is no excuse 
for avoiding obvious health precautions. Medicine has yet to prove how smoking 
causes lung cancer, but only the reckless smoke. Similarly, let no one dismiss 
the virus out of unfounded hopes that it is not the fearsome agent it seems to 
be.

THE STATE; CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; THE LEGIONS OF STUDENT DRUNKS ARE GROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

broadcast journalism.

<P>
 A women stands toward the back of a crowded room, observing the people and 
talking to her friend. The music is loud.The smells of beer and cigarettes are 
strong. A guy comes up from behind her, puts his arm around her and says, 
"Excuse me, but you dropped your smile." He thinks he's cool. She thinks, 
"Great, another drunk college guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol consumption has become as much a part of college life as football. 
More than 80% of college students drink on a regular basis. Worse, binge 
drinking is on the increase, especially among women, according to a study 
released by Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
 For male students, drinking is a social rite to acceptance: the more, the 
better. They are supposed to let loose when drinking and whatever happens is 
chalked up to intoxication. Women, on the other hand, are not supposed to be 
heavy drinkers. If they drink like men, they face social ostracism. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong. Women do some pretty wild and crazy things. Those with 
"nice and sweet" reputations during the day are sometimes found dancing on 
tables at night, flirting with strangers or passing out from too much booze. 
Indeed, what's especially alarming about the Columbia study is the news about 
binge drinking among female students. 
</P>
<P>
 It never ceases to amaze me how people change when they have been drinking. 
Granted, drinking lowers inhibition. But what about people whose personality 
drastically changes. What insecurities are they trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Kevin. When I met him, he was drunk. When I ran into him at a party, he 
was drunk again. But when I became separated from my friends, Kevin offered to 
walk me to my dorm. Since he seemed harmless -- he was just smiling and 
laughing -- I took him up on his offer.

STAGE WATCH: 'SUNSET' FOR $5 LESS -- FOR A WHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DON SHIRLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lower ticket prices for "Sunset Boulevard"? It's true -- during the July 5-26 
"previews" of Faye Dunaway and Rex Smith, the show's new leads, prices have 
been reduced by $5. 
</P>
<P>
 George Wachtel, director of research for the League of American Theatres and 
Producers can't remember a precedent. "I don't know of a star cast change where 
they ever lowered prices" during an interim period, Wachtel said. 
</P>
<P>
 So why are they doing it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a unique situation to Los Angeles," explained Edgar Dobie, head of U.S. 
operations of "Sunset" producer-composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, when Robert Guillaume replaced Michael Crawford in the Los Angeles 
production of Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera," the producers did not 
lower ticket prices -- and critics arrived on the second night, Dobie said. In 
L.A., "regular ticket prices meant anyone could be reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
 However, "we would like to give (Dunaway and Smith) the opportunity to 
complete the work on their performances" before critics see them. So he hopes 
critics will stay away during the lower-priced previews. "We accept the rules 
of the game," Dobie said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Dunaway's stature means it won't be "a normal cast replacement. 
It has a special event standing." Lest anyone interpret the lower prices as an 
indication that the show won't be up to snuff, Dobie said he was sure the July 
5-26 performances will be "every bit as enjoyable. . . . They will be 
full-blown performances." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have already bought tickets to the period in question can get $5 
back by taking or mailing the tickets to the box office. If you plan to get 
your five bucks back just prior to the performance you're attending, arrive 
early -- there may be a long line. 
</P>
<P>
 SUCH A DEAL?: Speaking of lower ticket prices, Theatre LA is opening a new 
source of theater ticket discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals and businesses may now become associate members of Theatre LA, an 
organization that until now had just represented theater producers. The annual 
cost for associate memberships: $35 (individuals) or $50 (businesses). 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest lure for associate members may be the promise of good deals on 
tickets, released on a limited basis by theaters who belong to Theatre LA -- 
which includes most of the theaters in town. PIN numbers will serve as keys to 
members-only ticket discounts offered over Theatre LA's (213) 688-ARTS phone 
information line. 
</P>
<P>
 These discounts are not to be confused with the half-price same-day tickets 
already offered over the 688-ARTS line. Those same-day discounts will continue 
and are available to anyone who calls that number on a day when theaters have 
released half-price tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The new discounts for associate members will allow more lead time in planning 
and could eventually offer a wider variety of deals. For example, at least one 
theater plans to offer 10% off the regular price of any of its shows to Theatre 
LA associate members. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they take advantage of their discounts, they'll get their $35 back pretty 
quickly," predicted William Freimuth, Theatre LA executive director.  
</P>
<P>
 Associate membership also will buy a subscription to the monthly Theatre LA 
newsletter -- which the group plans to expand into more of a magazine -- plus 
first dibs on tickets to the group's annual Ovation Awards ceremony, party 
invitations and use of the group's library. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular membership will still be restricted to theaters and producing 
companies. It costs more -- and provides additional services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Theatre LA staff also has a new second-in-command, Michelle McDonald, a 
UCLA arts management graduate. She replaced Meri Nana-Ama Danquah.

 BIG SANDBOX: If you want a beach bad enough, you can always build one. The 
Army Corps of Engineers is now taking public comment on Seal Beach's plans to 
bring in 150,000 cubic yards of sand to rebuild its East Beach -- between the 
pier and the west jetty of Anaheim Bay -- which has eroded over the years. The 
sand will come from the Santa Ana River bed. . . . If you're having trouble 
figuring out how much sand that is, federal officials say it's about 10,000 
truck trips. 
</P>
<P>
 FARAWAY PLACES: The official World Cup guidebook suggests several Orange 
County hotels as places to stay during the international soccer tournament, 
which starts this week. Just don't look for many of them on the official World 
Cup map. . . . Le Meridien in Newport Beach, the Marriotts in Irvine and 
Newport Beach, the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, and the Hilton Waterfront in 
Huntington Beach were all listed as "off the map." Hotels in the Knott's Berry 
Farm and Disneyland area did make the map. 
</P>
<P>
 HER HONOR: For 18 years, Betty Elias has sat on the bench in Municipal Court 
in Fullerton. She says that's enough and plans to retire in August. But before 
she goes, she'll get a chance to know how much she's meant to other women in 
the legal profession. Monday, she'll be honored by the Orange County Women 
Lawyers Assn. as "Judge of the Year." . . . A spokeswoman says its board's 
unanimous vote would have come without Elias' retirement: "But we're glad that 
we're doing it while she's still on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 BIG FOOTSTEPS: Maybe you wouldn't associate Jackson, Miss., with the art 
world, but it happens to be home to the U.S. International Ballet Competition. 
And they're boasting a little at the Coast Ballet Theatre in San Clemente: 
Three of its members who auditioned are among 120 nationwide selected to attend 
the competition this week. . . . How prestigious would it be to win its gold 
medal? One former winner is Mikhail Baryshnikov.

MASSACHUSETTS GIRL GRADUATES FROM HOMELESSNESS TO HARVARD; ADVERSITY: LAURALEE 
TAUGHT HERSELF TO READ AT AGE 4, TURNING TO BOOKS TO COPE WITH LIFE IN SHELTERS 
AND WELFARE HOTELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB GLOSTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lights jolted her awake every 6 a.m. From her cot, she watched people in 
the Salvation Army shelter brace for another day. Then fourth-grader Lauralee 
Summer would sit up and open her books. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone with her words: In a vagabond childhood, fatherless and sometimes 
homeless, this was a familiar, comforting place for Lauralee. 
</P>
<P>
 She'd taught herself to read from a "See & Say" book she bought with fourth 
birthday money. As she and her mother moved among shelters and welfare hotels 
in three states, she turned to library books for solace. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall she'll be able to read in a room of her own -- at Harvard 
University, which has extended a full scholarship to the 17-year-old Quincy 
High School senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Any chance Harvard is taking with Lauralee is overcome by the chance provided 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very rewarding to see Harvard pick up someone like Lauralee," said 
Charlie MacLaughlin, a Quincy High administrator. Harvard will "traditionally 
get the best of the best, but they tend to fit into that category of having the 
Harvard personality, and she is so different." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaughlin is director of the high school's Heritage Program, which offers an 
alternative for dropouts, disciplinary problems and students such as Lauralee, 
who don't fit into a traditional school setting. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that she's a rebellious or indifferent student. Lauralee ranks 15th 
in her 292-member class, which graduated last Monday, and scored a top-notch 
1460 on her SAT exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a naturally gifted athlete, she nonetheless runs distance races on the 
track team and, as Quincy's second female wrestler, won two matches against 
boys in the 112-pound weight class last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 She dyes her fair hair purple and wears a nose ring. She plays the violin -- 
in the school's concert band because it has no orchestra, taking the parts 
written for oboe. 
</P>
<P>
 She tutors grade school children and does volunteer work for Amnesty 
International. She spent last summer in Florida with a church group, rebuilding 
homes for victims of Hurricane Andrew. She plans to study comparative religion 
at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 What's remarkable, considering such a resume, is that Lauralee spent most of 
her rootless childhood feeling alienated from classmates and bored by lessons 
she considered irrelevant. But she seems not in the least angry or arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just a different character," MacLaughlin said. "A very gentle, sincere 
personality. She's very humble and doesn't view herself as being as spectacular 
as I do." 
</P>
<P>
 In a one-on-one conversation, Lauralee is shy, ill-at-ease with praise, 
hesitant describing her stays in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 It's in written words that she best finds her expression -- in quotes from the 
Bible and from poet Emily Dickinson that hang in her room, or an essay she 
wrote for her college application: 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that wealth is not what I have; rather it is who I am. Being poor, 
being homeless, having my startled eyes opened to blinding lights and long rows 
of metal cots from which so many strangers were arising, these were not 
disadvantages but blessings, because they taught me more about myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauralee credits her mother and faith in God with motivating her to overcome a 
deprived, sometimes cruel, childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Summer was divorced, jobless and homeless in Santa Rosa, Calif., 
when Lauralee was born in November, 1976. They went to Oregon to be near 
relatives, including Summer's four other children, and moved frequently as 
Summer, then 36, sought work as a nurse's aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauralee has sweet memories of sitting on her mother's lap listening to 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was about 20 months old when I began reading to her every single night," 
said Summer, who recalls a well-thumbed book of nursery rhymes. "I read the 
same book every night. That was the only book we had." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauralee's childhood also included homeless shelters in Phoenix and Santa 
Barbara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had to sleep on the street," Lauralee said. "I didn't feel threatened 
at all. I think I was too young to really think about it. My mom was mostly 
always with me." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 10, Lauralee tried fourth-grade classes in two Santa Barbara schools, 
then basically quit, opting to read to herself at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated school. I hated it because I didn't know anyone," she said. "I felt 
like school had no meaning for me, because it was like, 'Why do I want to learn 
about that when my life is so strange?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Oregon where Summer found work, Lauralee still felt out of place with 
peers. She retreated again into books, sometimes borrowing so many from the 
library that her mother couldn't see her head above the wobbly stacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was separated from everyone," Lauralee said. "They accepted me 
and everything, but I just felt like I knew so many different things than them, 
that they were so innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 In her essay, Lauralee describes her mother as "a dreamer with many castles in 
the air, but few foundations beneath them." But the dreamer was looking out for 
the daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of Massachusetts' array of colleges, Summer came to believe that her 
daughter would get a better education on the other side of the country. The two 
arrived by bus in October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 First stop was a Boston homeless shelter, then a room in a welfare hotel. 
Lauralee spent three months in a foster home when Summer took a live-in job 
caring for a paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as part of a church program, the Summers had supper at the Quincy home 
of Marion Stout. In 1990, she invited them to move in. They still live there. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Lauralee first came here," Stout said, "she was crying and saying, 'I 
just want a place where I can get mail sent.' " 
</P>
<P>

 Five years ago, Daniel Eyink was a gourmet chef. At graduation ceremonies a 
week ago, he became a doctor, one of a throng of new graduates who switched to 
medicine after rearing families and pursuing other careers. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's crop of medical school graduates includes a former bartender, an 
opera singer, a tennis pro, a shipbuilder, a trombone player, a tree surgeon, a 
priest and an aerobics instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 They were accepted to medical schools at a time when applications were low, 
and life experience began to be considered an acceptable credential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can relate to patients more as people, knowing what they've 
struggled through," said Eyink, 39, who graduated from the University of 
Massachusetts Medical School. "I've had some wonderful experiences talking to 
patients about being a chef. Everybody can relate to food." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Assn. of American Medical Colleges, there were more than 
42,600 applicants to U.S. medical schools in 1971. That number plummeted to 
26,721 in 1989, when this year's class applied for admission. It has since 
climbed to a record 42,808. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been an increasing trend among medical school admissions committees 
to look at all of a person's life experiences in a more open light," said Dr. 
Jeffrey Bernhard, associate dean of admissions at UMass Medical. 
</P>
<P>
 Many applicants who switched to medicine from other fields said they didn't 
think they could handle medical school when they were younger, but came to wish 
that they had tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out back in the dark ages as an undergraduate in a pre-med 
curriculum, but I felt like a little country boy gone to the big city," said 
Robert Lindsay, who changed his undergraduate major and became a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay, 38, decided that he wanted more from life and was accepted to the 
Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine. He plans to go into family 
practice near his hometown of Massillon, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Duff, a 43-year-old former oil company geologist, found herself acting 
as "a mother hen" on rounds with younger students at the Baylor College of 
Medicine in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're incredibly bright, but they haven't in some cases developed social 
skills," said Duff, whose son also is in medical school. "I took it on myself 
to, in a friendly way, help them out with that. That extra 20 years of life 
gives me a little broader perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some life experiences can be more helpful than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Guthrie, who graduated from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center in Dallas, is a former trombone player who once backed up singer Tom 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that got me into medical school," said Guthrie, 41, "because the dean 
was a big Tom Jones fan."

ROLE OF EGYPT'S 'LOURDES' UNVEILED; ARCHEOLOGY: ONGOING EXCAVATION HAS YET TO 
REVEAL FULL EXTENT OF ANCIENT RELIGIOUS SITE. EARLY CHRISTIANS SEEKING MIRACLES 
ONCE FLOCKED TO AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The German archeologist Peter Grossmann has spent 30 years trying to unravel 
the story of one of early Christianity's great pilgrimage centers, Abu Mina, a 
city of miracles 1,400 years before France's Lourdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Early pilgrims came here to pray at the grave of Menas, a 4th-Century 
Christian martyr beheaded by Egypt's Roman occupiers. Said to be a place of 
miracles, the grave became the cornerstone of a vast religious complex, Egypt's 
most acclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a searing sun, Grossmann stared over the vast ruins, stretching 
endlessly across bleached sand. He spoke about the peculiarity of the work, 
mixing Abu Mina's history -- things he can touch -- with centuries of legends 
and tales of miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here to challenge the beliefs about Abu Mina," Grossmann said. 
"We're here to let the rocks tell the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossmann, of Cairo's German Archeological Institute, has studied early 
Christian sites throughout the Middle East. Abu Mina is historically special 
for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 Few relics survive in Egypt from the 4th to the 6th centuries, after Roman 
persecution ended and Christianity was legalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most early Christian monuments, altered repeatedly over the centuries, 
Abu Mina retains much of the feeling of old. 
</P>
<P>
 Cairo's ancient churches, some said to have provided sanctuary for Mary, 
Joseph and Jesus as they fled from Herod's wrath in Judea, have been rebuilt so 
many times that nothing exists of the original. What's seen today is medieval, 
not early Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Abu Mina's remains survive amazingly intact, giving archeologists a 
chance to study in detail a period when dramatic change swept the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Mina's historical significance was underscored in 1979 by UNESCO, the main 
U.N. cultural agency, which placed the pilgrimage center on its world heritage 
list. Only five of Egypt's thousands of antiquity sites share the distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite almost a century of excavation, Abu Mina has yet to yield its last 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Sunday morning, Grossmann walked the ruins. The stillness was 
interrupted only by occasional murmurs of wandering sheep and goats, tended by 
neighborhood Bedouins. Flowers dotted the desert, offerings of a recent 
rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have other sites, but Abu Mina is unusual because it hasn't been 
dramatically disturbed," Grossmann said. "What we have here, we can 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
 For archeologists, Abu Mina provides fascinating insights not only into early 
Christianity's rites and customs but also into evolving church architecture and 
changing life outside church walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Major ruins include ancient Egypt's largest church, the Great Basilica, dating 
from the late 5th or early 6th Century; the Martyr-Church, built over Menas' 
grave, and a baptistery where male and female pilgrims were baptized 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of Abu Mina began with the burial of Menas, possibly a 
Greek-Egyptian, whose wealthy parents died when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of his father gave Menas a place in the Roman army. But he deserted 
his post, refused to worship pagan idols and was beheaded, perhaps during 
Emperor Diocletian's savage persecution of Christians in AD 304-5. 
</P>
<P>
 His body was buried in a desert crypt, probably a family grave, 30 miles 
southwest of Alexandria. After Christianity was legalized in 313, word spread 
quickly that Menas' tomb was a place of miraculous healing. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrimages to areas associated with the Virgin Mary or popular saints were 
distinctive to Egyptian Christianity from the beginning. Although Egypt claimed 
20 early sites, Abu Mina remained the most popular until the Middle Ages when 
it gradually sank into obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Believers from around the Mediterranean flocked here to pray. By the 5th 
Century Abu Mina had grown from simple surroundings to a famous, richly endowed 
miracle center with elaborate churches, hotels and hawkers. 
</P>
<P>
 For souvenirs, pilgrims took home pottery flasks filled with holy water. Known 
as Menas bottles, they have been found as far away as Spain and France. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrims stayed a few days, others weeks, even years. At Abu Mina, 
archeologists are uncovering accommodations ranging from the posh for the rich 
pilgrim to simple courtyards for the weary poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Excavation is showing that longtime residents had their own quarters, with 
separate toilets for men and women -- along with hairdressers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We read a description left by an early pilgrim or traveler, and sometimes the 
archeology supports the story," Grossmann said. "We're digging, and there it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Mina was lost to scholars until 1905 when a German archeologist searching 
for Abu Mina fell ill and was carried toward shade. Superstitious Bedouin 
guides, afraid of the site's aura, had managed to keep others far afield. 
</P>
<P>
 The shade that soothed the ailing archeologist came from the ruins of Abu 
Mina. 
</P>
<P>
 Its discovery came 53 years after Bernadette Soubirous visualized the Virgin 
Mary at Lourdes in southwestern France. The Virgin is said to have told the 
young girl of a miraculous underground spring, which has since been visited by 
millions of afflicted pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
 Coptic and Greek Orthodox pilgrims and other seekers still congregate at Abu 
Mina. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Nov. 24, the Coptic feast day of St. Menas, as many as 20,000 Copts 
visit nearby Abu Mina Monastery, built to honor St. Menas' cult. 
</P>
<P>
 Many walk into the desert to pray in the ruined miracle center.

TAIWAN HUNTS FOR RADIOACTIVE APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT McDONALD, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the worst selling points for an apartment in Taiwan is to say it was 
built between 1982 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartments constructed during that period are now the target of a great 
Taiwanese hunt for radioactive buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between 1% and 2% of the 25,000 to 30,000 apartments checked until now are 
radioactive," said Wang Mann-tchao, a vice-chairman of the Cabinet's Atomic 
Energy Council (AEC). 
</P>
<P>
 The AEC began the search in August, 1992, and says it eventually wants to 
check 200,000 households island-wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the radioactivity comes from steel rods, and in some of the 
buildings it was high enough to pose a possible health risk -- and to knock as 
much as 10% off the price of an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been reported ill yet and Wang describes it as "really a 
psychological problem. They always think of this as equivalent to a nuclear 
bomb, but it's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Fu Ben-jun doesn't believe him. The 35-year-old Taipei businesswoman says she 
is not sure about the results of the test in April on her rented suburban 
apartment, but she is nevertheless moving out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know," she said. "They give you all this technical jargon, I 
wouldn't be able to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to move but that speeded up my decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery started when steel bars being taken into a nuclear power plant set 
off alarm bells at the gate, Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They then traced back through the manufacturer and found another building in 
Tienmu (a Taipei suburb) was contaminated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the radioactive steel has not been determined. Wang believes it 
was in imported scrap metal from the West, because the type of radioactivity 
comes from cobalt 60, which Taiwan does not produce. 
</P>
<P>
 The AEC decided to check every apartment built in Taiwan within a two-year 
period of when the steel was produced. Devices have been installed at steel 
plants to monitor incoming scrap metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We estimated the radiation if they stay in an apartment 365 days a year and 
24 hours a day," Wang said. "We decided (if the occupant received) 1.5 rems in 
this time we're going to buy the apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Rem stands for a unit of radiation that, when absorbed by a person, produces a 
certain physiological effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people whose apartments are going to be bought are haggling over the 
price with the government while prices for some apartments built in the 1982-84 
periods have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The selling price has certainly gone down," Fu said of apartments in her 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 She said prices have already dropped 10% from prices before the building was 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials did not know how widespread the problem is because of lax inspection 
practices and a lack of knowledge of the dangers of excessive radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two AEC officials were impeached last year for not reporting radiation at a 
dental office in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found that even before they turned the X-ray machine on, the Geiger 
counter went off," Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that instead of reporting the problem, the inspectors only asked that 
a sheet of lead be placed over the wall where the radioactivity was coming 
from. 
</P>
<P>
 The first building discovered to be contaminated in the Taipei suburb was torn 
down because it was still under construction. The steel was buried. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wang said more than 10 metric tons of the steel has been stolen and he 
thinks it was used as a foundation for a factory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regular (safety) procedures were not followed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartments the government buys will be turned into storage spaces or 
reconstructed using lead protective sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, 47, a specialist in radiation with a doctorate from the University of 
Alabama, said that, excluding salaries, the AEC has spent about $15 million on 
the searches. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of this, he said, there is an unlimited budget to buy those apartments 
found to be heavily contaminated. He said the Cabinet will issue more 
compensation guidelines soon.

FRIENDSHIP RESCUES D-DAY VETERAN; ROMANCE: CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART TRACKS DOWN 
WORLD WAR II SOLDIER WHO HAD LOST HIS WAY IN LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Connolly made his way safely through D-day and the Battle of the Bulge, 
but lost his way in life. Now his childhood sweetheart has tracked him down, 
reunited him with his family and brought him home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got curious. I think you always have that thing in the back of your mind," 
Lorraine Breeden said. "I don't know if you call it first love, but you always 
think, 'What if?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She insists they're just friends. But she visits him frequently at the 
veteran's hospital where she helped him move in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating the D-day anniversary last week, they attended a hospital chapel 
service together, and he led the Pledge of Allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 Before World War II, they lived around the corner from each other in Boston's 
Dorchester neighborhood. They held hands on the way to the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the crazy things that teen-agers do, innocent things," she said. "And 
then the war broke out and everything changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly, then 17, lied about his age and enlisted. 
</P>
<P>
 On D-day, he helped clear the beach of mines with a metal detector and a 
bayonet. In liberated Paris, he guzzled champagne and nuzzled women. At the 
Battle of the Bulge, he shot tanks with a bazooka. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine dated and married Dick Breeden, a Navy cook, before Connolly came 
home in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what he was thinking and he was too shy to say anything," she 
said. "As I told him many a time after I found him, if he had let me know how 
he felt, maybe things would have been different." 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly re-enlisted the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was young and I got the taste of the foreign girls so I went back in 
again," he said with a rueful smile. "And what I was looking for was right 
where I left it, right here." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he did after his discharge in 1965, the 68-year-old veteran 
pantomimed lifting a bottle to his lips. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1984, he said, he was sober. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Breeden's husband died. 
</P>
<P>
 Breeden, now a great-grandmother, said she "wouldn't change a minute of my 
life with him," but she remembered Connolly and started looking for him in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 1992 that she learned he was living in Indianapolis, being 
treated for back, hip and hearing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote. He called almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I understand you're looking for someone from Wayland Street.' And 
it was just like 45 or 50 years had never gone," Breeden remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two days later, he flew to Massachusetts and got reacquainted. He called 
his relatives for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't stopped thanking her for finding our uncle," said Joyce Foster, a 
niece. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly's health declined, so Breeden helped him move from Indiana to a 
Veterans Administration hospital in Bedford. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Breeden rides a bus three hours each way to visit him four times a 
week. She bakes him cookies, does his laundry, urges him to keep walking and 
chides him to stop smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the world of him," she said. "I'll never marry him, but I'll be his 
friend until the day one of us dies. No matter how many memories or family you 
have, it's no fun to be alone."

MILWAUKEE SETS ASIDE HOUSING FOR SENIORS; TRENDS: CITY OFFICIALS RESTRICT SEVEN 
OF 14 PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS TO OLDER PEOPLE, WHO HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT CRIME, 
NOISE AND DRUGS.

 Leonard Cherry, 65, says he was robbed by a neighbor who came into his public 
housing apartment on the pretext of asking for a drink of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Morris, 80, says loud music keeps him awake. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Just, 87, and Phyllis Banaszynski, 79, won't ride the elevators at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 All say they won't leave their apartments alone after dark, in large part 
because of younger residents who abuse drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they drink, smoke those drugs, they don't care about you, me, anyone," 
Cherry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee officials, responding to the complaints, have announced plans to 
reserve seven of the city's 14 public housing high-rises for senior citizens. 
Slightly more than half of the 2,300 people living in the high-rises are 62 or 
older. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first time a city has sought and received permission to implement an 
amendment to the 1992 federal housing law that allows cities to set aside 
portions of their public housing for senior citizens, according to Joseph 
Shuldiner of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, federal law was amended to allow mentally disabled people 
treated for drug and alcohol abuse to occupy public housing along with elderly 
residents and those with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This meant that the apartments set aside for elderly and disabled had a whole 
new population of people," said Martha Brown, a staff assistant with the 
Department of City Development. "These were a very different type of person." 
</P>
<P>
 Public housing managers said the influx of new residents, particularly those 
with drug and alcohol problems, threatened elderly residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "These little ladies who used to quilt in the lounges or walk the hallways -- 
they can't do that anymore," said Pat Paskel, manager of the Riverview 
Apartments, a public housing high-rise. "It's made the elderly virtually 
prisoners in their own apartments." 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly also started looking for housing elsewhere. Less than a third of 
the 700 people on waiting lists for public housing are elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems spurred city leaders to push for changes in the law. In 1992, a 
panel led by Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist recommended separating the elderly. 
Rep. Gerald Klezcka (D-Wis.) used the recommendation as a basis for an 
amendment to the 1992 housing law. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD issued regulations April 15 allowing cities to designate portions of their 
public housing as elderly-only. Cities must have individual plans approved by 
the department, HUD spokeswoman Vivian Potter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee filed plans with HUD outlining its program to separate the elderly 
in its public housing in January. In February -- before HUD had approved the 
plan -- the city announced that seven of the city's 14 public housing 
high-rises would begin accepting only senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement -- and the federal approval -- had a dramatic effect. In 
contrast to last December, when no one applied for public housing, there were 
51 applicants in the first 17 days of April, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, things are looking up," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens living in the seven buildings not designated elderly-only may 
stay in those buildings. But if they want to move they will get the first 
available opening in the elderly-only high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Milwaukee's new rules, younger tenants currently living in the seven 
facilities reserved for the elderly will be allowed to stay, but new younger 
tenants will be housed in the remaining buildings, said Ricardo Diaz, the 
director of the Milwaukee Housing Authority.

RESTIVE POLAND LOOKS FOR ITS PLACE IN EUROPE AND NATO; GOVERNMENT: WARSAW HOPES 
TO JOIN THE WEST AND STILL MAINTAIN TIES WITH FORMER SOVIET BLOC ALLIES. BUT 
MORE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE MUST COME FIRST.

<P>
 Five years after the fall of communism, Poland seems adrift, unsure where it 
fits into an evolving Europe or how to make its restive people happy. 
</P>
<P>
 It wants to join the European Union and NATO, but more economic and political 
change must come first. It wants to stay friendly with its former Warsaw Pact 
allies and serve as a bridge to the West, but some Russian officials prefer 
that their buffer with NATO be more neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, Poland is doing well. Europe's fastest-growing economy 
expanded by more than 4% last year and the Finance Ministry predicts that rate 
will continue for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Shops that once offered scant supplies of poor-quality goods are filled with 
Levis, Sony TVs and IBM computers. Retail sales jumped by 48% last year. 
McDonald's, Pizza Hut and other fast-food outlets do a brisk business. 
</P>
<P>
 But while some people are getting rich from the new capitalism, most are 
closer to the average monthly wage of $200 and find the plentiful luxuries 
beyond their means. The growing gap between rich and poor seems to be 
generating animosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poland is trying to reform its economy, but the process is difficult and the 
path from communism to capitalism is long," President Lech Walesa said. 
"Western countries were constructing their capitalist systems for 200 years. We 
have to do this and adjust ourselves within a decade." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said that "changing the social consciousness 
has proved to be the most difficult and time-consuming problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Poland's 40 million citizens have learned the hard way that democracy and 
capitalism carry responsibility, the risk of failure and a much smaller social 
safety net than communism provided. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent government report said 42.5% of Poles are living below the poverty 
line (45% of national average pay), more than double the 20.5% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 So displeased are the people about not benefiting more quickly from the 
painful economic reforms that one opinion poll indicated one-third would 
willingly return to communism. Only one in 10 of those questioned felt his 
family's standard of living had improved. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter the complaints, officials cite the shortages and limits on 
individual freedoms that characterized the old system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poland today is better than the one before '89 despite the problems and 
frustrations of many people, who truly have reasons to be frustrated," said 
Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former Communist sports minister and probable 
candidate in next year's presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwasniewski leads one of the two parties in the governing coalition formed 
after the parliamentary elections of September, 1993. In a backlash against 
reform, voters flocked to political groups that grew out of the old Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland wants to join NATO as a safeguard against possible upheaval in the 
former Soviet Union, but needs time and help to bring its military equipment 
and training up to the alliance's standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Tadeusz Iwinski, a member of the Foreign Affairs Commission in Parliament, 
said Poland "is still looking for its place in the international arena: It is 
no longer a country with limited sovereignty, but it is neither a NATO member 
nor a neutral country." 
</P>
<P>
 Poland could play a pivotal role in the region. Washington has designated it 
as one of the 10 "big emerging markets" because of its capacity for growth and 
leadership, and President Clinton is scheduled to visit in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 "With national security and economic security increasingly intertwined, Poland 
is important both as a potential market for American goods and as a stable, 
growing economy in what is still a precarious region," U.S. Commerce Secretary 
Ronald H. Brown said last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Private enterprise has boomed, and now accounts for about 60% of the gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland has an association agreement with the European Union and has applied 
for full membership, but that is unlikely before 2000 and will be followed by a 
10-year adjustment period. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski believes agricultural policy will be the 
most difficult problem. Poland's farmers, a powerful lobby, are notoriously 
inefficient. About 8 million tons of potatoes rot each year, and too many are 
of low quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment is running about 16%, or 3 million people. Although inflation has 
declined dramatically, it jumped 5% in the first three months of 1994 and is 
forecast to total 23% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 1.5 million families do not have homes of their own and the 
building industry produced only 88,000 new apartments last year. Outdated 
factories and cars belch pollution. Coal still provides nearly two-thirds of 
the power. The road, telecommunications and utility systems are in poor 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized crime and tax evasion are increasing. The corruption that became 
entrenched under communism has been hard to root out. 
</P>
<P>
 With other former Soviet bloc countries suffering their own economic problems, 
Poland has been forced to seek new markets and foreign capital to help 
modernize its industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Jozef Biskup, co-author of a report based on a survey of 570 foreign 
investors, said they like Poland because of its rapid economic development, the 
size of its market and the cheap labor. It also provides access to a free-trade 
zone being established by Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Biskup said investors are put off by the red tape, lack of good managers 
and unstable tax system. 
</P>
<P>
 Political stability also has become a question. Acrimony within government has 
increased, particularly between Walesa and the governing coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, the confrontational Walesa was the country's most popular 
person as head of Solidarity, Eastern Europe's first free-trade union and the 
main force in bringing down communism. 
</P>
<P>
 With just a year of his presidency left, however, he found himself fifth in a 
recent poll of potential candidates. Kwasniewski was No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Solidarity's political movement did not even get the 5% of the 
vote required for inclusion in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite all the problems, officials say Poland's general course needs 
only minor corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 "No rational political group can think about changing things now," Kwasniewski 
said. "We have a good climate. We don't know how long it will last. This kind 
of chance may not come again."

COLD WAR END DOESN'T EASE SECRECY TREND; BUREAUCRACY: THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS 
BILLIONS AND EMPLOYS A SMALL ARMY TO SAFEGUARD NATIONAL SECURITY SECRETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. JEFFREY SMITH, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cold War may be over, but the task of keeping millions and millions of 
government documents away from the prying eyes of America's enemies still keeps 
more than 32,397 workers employed full time, according to the first-ever tally 
by government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 And the government may be spending more than $16 billion a year to safeguard a 
growing stockpile of national security secrets created or managed by these 
workers, industry estimates and the new accounting for the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) show. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-one percent of this cost, or an estimated $13.8 billion, reflects what 
defense contractors told the federal government they were billing Washington 
for classification expenses in 1989. No contractor estimates have been made 
since then, but experts said last month they believe the costs may still be in 
that range despite a decline in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $2.28 billion reflects what federal agencies told OMB this 
spring they will spend this year to protect classified information. And $200 
million more reflects what the intelligence community recently estimated it is 
spending on security, a classified figure that many government officials and 
independent experts describe as an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 About 31,000 of the full-time employees safeguarding classified documents, 
enough to populate a small city, are attached to the Defense Department. But 
even the Department of the Interior has the equivalent of 30 full-time workers 
assigned to protect secrets related to national security, according to the OMB 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several other departments with mandates that would seem of scant interest 
to foreign spies -- such as Agriculture or Health and Human Services -- 
Interior told the OMB that it spends thousands of dollars annually on alarms, 
special copying machines, shredders, secure telephones, security clearances and 
costly office equipment with suppressed electronic emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary data "shows that we are spending one heck of a lot of money on 
protecting paper," said Rep. David E. Skaggs (D-Colo.), a member of the House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who demanded the OMB accounting in 
legislation enacted last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My judgment all along has been . . . that a good deal of what is classified 
is classified for reasons other than national security," including bureaucratic 
inertia and attempts to prevent political embarrassment, Skaggs said. As an 
example, he cited the CIA's decision last year to classify agency expenditures 
on wheelchair ramps and other measures the agency took to comply with the 
Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Schauble, director of the records declassification division of the 
National Archives, reported recently that more than 325 million pages of 
classified records are in its holdings, "with more coming in all the time." 
Most of the documents are more than 30 years old, although they include more 
recent vintage Army documents from the Vietnam War and State Department records 
from the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Schauble said the archives' total classified holdings are 2 1/2 times larger 
than they were in 1984. Safeguarding the holdings requires the equivalent of 
110 full-time employees and $9.5 million annually, according to the OMB report. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has vowed to reform classification procedures and 
promote more openness by shrinking the number of secret documents produced and 
retained by the government. But in its first year, the Administration actually 
classified documents at a higher rate than the George Bush Administration did 
in 1992, according to the 1994 annual report of the government-wide Information 
Security Oversight Office, a branch of the General Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference was only 1%, but the total number of federal classification 
actions in 1993 was so high -- 6.1 million -- that it means President Clinton's 
team effectively created 60,000 more bits of classified data than President 
George Bush's team did in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton's appointees also supervised the declassification of 
30% fewer pages in 1993 than Bush appointees accomplished in 1992, producing a 
net growth of "many more millions of classified pages," according to Steven 
Garfinkel, director of the oversight office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means that unless you are a Russian spy, there is more and more 
information becoming inaccessible," said Federation of American Scientists 
analyst Stephen Aftergood, alluding to the recent guilty plea to conspiracy to 
commit espionage by former CIA employee Aldrich H. Ames. "The situation is 
basically out of control; more information is classified today than there was 
when the Berlin Wall was torn down." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents may be stamped "classified" by authorized officials who determine 
that they contain information vital to national security. The lowest level of 
classification is "Confidential" and reflects a judgment that some damage to 
national security would occur if the document were disclosed. "Secret" is used 
if serious damage will result and "Top Secret" only if "exceptionally grave 
damage" will occur. The categories apply to a vast range of government records. 
</P>
<P>
 The OMB report indicates that a substantial chunk of the cost of maintaining 
classified information is self-sustaining; that is, it pays for managing and 
improving classification procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department, for example, is spending $252 million this year on 
classification guides, cost accounting, couriers and other document-handling or 
disposal activities performed by an estimated 4,917 full-time employees, 
according to the OMB tally. It is spending an additional $88 million for 
classification oversight, which means watching those who are watching the 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Interior Department is spending $128,560 for classification "policy 
development," or roughly $87,500 more than it spends for the guard force at 
facilities where its trove of national security secrets is stored. An 
additional $76,517 is spent by the department on classification oversight, 
including "self-inspections." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Education Department, which seemingly would have a hard time keeping 
secret the operations of public schools, probably tops the security layer cake 
by allocating $7,378 to write a classification guide and installing $7,264 
worth of secure telephones this year. 
</P>
<P>
 An Education Department spokesman had some difficulty finding someone who knew 
what the phones were for, but finally said they were needed for discussions of 
travel plans by "foreign education officials" and reports to other federal 
agencies about student loan defaults. "This is national security with a lower 
case," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most federal agencies told OMB they plan to spend less for safeguarding 
national secrets next year, although the Department of Energy cautioned that 
"we will have to invest additional resources in order to reduce costs in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one knows exactly what the intelligence community spends now or plans 
to spend in the future to safeguard documents. Nor is it clear how many 
thousands of intelligence community employees are involved in the effort (the 
number was not included in OMB's tally). When members of the Joint Security 
Commission created by the CIA and the Defense Department asked for this data 
last year, they got back "incomplete, inconsistent" answers, according to their 
February report.

FEDERAL PANEL WINNOWING RULES FOR 'ORGANIC' CROPS; AGRICULTURE: 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS, FARMERS, PROCESSORS, CONSUMER ADVOCATES AND SCIENTISTS ARE 
TRYING TO WRITE STANDARDS FOR CROPS AND LIVESTOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GREENE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And you thought organic farming just meant spreading manure instead of 
commercial fertilizer, using a natural bug killer instead of a factory-made 
concoction. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding what can be called organic is so complex that the National Organic 
Standard Board has been working on suggested standards off and on for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's 14 volunteer members hope they are nearly finished, after a 
six-day marathon session in Santa Fe, N.M. They'll be able to give the 
Agriculture Department material to draft regulations on what qualifies food to 
be sold as organic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really having to go crop by crop," said James Michael Sligh of 
Greenville, S.C., chairman of the board and head of a nonprofit group that 
advocates sustainable agriculture. "In order to be useful, these 
recommendations have to be as specific as they possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists, farmers, processors, consumer advocates and scientists 
are also trying to define organically produced livestock -- which includes 
everything from cows to honeybees. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are working on standards for labels, canning, certification of 
farmers, accreditation of agencies that will give the "organic" designation, 
and biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 state, regional or private organizations certify products as 
organic. The national guidelines, required in the 1990 farm bill, will assure 
everyone is using the same basic rules. 
</P>
<P>
 USDA officials hope to propose rules in November and have them in place next 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Organic farming generally means rotating crops and using biological pest 
controls and proper tilling to protect and nourish the soil while growing crops 
free of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 It also means raising livestock without using steroids or regular low-level 
doses of antibiotics and without regularly cooping them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Some issues are simple. The law says farms will have to use organic practices 
for three years before being certified. They will have to keep records of such 
things as fertilizer application and livestock sources for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Timetables will be tricky. Organic farmers may not use seeds that are treated 
to prevent them from rotting in the ground. But untreated seeds are hard to 
come by, so their use will have to be gradually eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize currently there is not enough of untreated organic seed of every 
variety necessary to say this is required tomorrow," Sligh said. "At the same 
time, we don't want to discourage companies from making this type of progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Labeling for processed foods could be contentious. The law says a product can 
be labeled as organic if 5% of its weight is non-organic. But does that 5% 
allow for hard-to-find ingredients, or does it mean a box of cereal from 
organic grain but with non-organic raisins can be labeled as organic? 
</P>
<P>
 "The committee recommendation is kind of open-ended now," said Merrill Clark, 
a farmer from Cassopolis, Mich., a consumer representative on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark also chairs the livestock committee, which is breaking new ground 
because organic livestock-raising has a relatively short history compared to 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of the more complicated issues, because farmers will have to keep 
track of each animal, what it ate, and what medicine it received. The 1990 law 
already resolves one dilemma, though: Farmers will lose their organic 
certification if they let a sick animal die or suffer by denying it lifesaving 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 But once saved, the animal no longer is considered organic. 
</P>
<P>
 An even more grueling task will come in the fall, when the board comes up with 
a list of ingredients that may or may not be used in organic farming. 
</P>
<P>
 What, for example, will be done about pyrethrum, a plant-based pesticide, and 
its synthetic forms? 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's biotechnology. The board has so far agreed that genetic 
engineering isn't natural, so any product will be have to considered for the 
national list of approved and prohibited substances.

BASQUE PEOPLE CONSULTED TO PREEMPT EXTREMISTS; SPAIN: AFTER SABOTAGE OF EARLIER 
ROAD PROJECT, REGIONAL OFFICIALS APPOINT CITIZENS' PANELS TO OPERATE IN SPIRIT 
OF AUZOLAN, BASQUE FOR WORKING TOGETHER, TO FIND WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN LINNEE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a region where separatist violence can determine the outcome of big and 
small projects alike, the Basque regional government has decided to try 
something new: Ask the people what they think. 
</P>
<P>
 To preempt extremists who sabotaged an earlier road project, the government 
has appointed citizens' panels to evaluate a plan to widen the only two-lane 
stretch in a highway that runs from Sweden to southern Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time officials tried to build a road in the troubled Basque country, 
the separatist ETA and environmental groups opposed it. ETA gunmen killed three 
people and wounded nine in a violent campaign to demonstrate that no major 
undertaking could succeed without their approval. 
</P>
<P>
 ETA, the initials of Basque Homeland and Liberty in the Basque language, has 
fought since 1968 for independence in Spain's Basque country, the northern 
provinces of Alava, Guipuzcoa and Vizcaya. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 700 people have been killed, most of them police and military 
officers. Popular support for ETA has waned in recent years, but sporadic 
violence continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic idea of the citizens' panels is to change the tone of confrontation 
that affects controversial issues like these in the Basque country and turn it 
into a debate," said Luxio Ugarte of the consulting firm that organized the 
three-month study of the highway project. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes the 14 panels, totaling 350 people, will succeed because of 
auzolan. That is Basque for working together, the normal practice among the 
tough farmers, fishermen and ironsmiths of the pre-industrial Basque country. 
</P>
<P>
 ETA was caught off guard and has remained silent. Its political arm, Herri 
Batasuna, has become just one more group presenting its position to the 
citizens' panels. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, when the regional government began building a road through 
the Leizaran River Valley, it failed to reckon with environmentalists and ETA. 
After a political deal that left ETA looking like the winner, the route of the 
road was changed and the cost of building it soared. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish Basque country, virtually independent until the early 19th 
Century, once again has considerable autonomy. Under terms of a 1979 home-rule 
arrangement, it collects its own taxes from the 1.7 million people, manages its 
own education system and maintains its own police force. 
</P>
<P>
 In a region where violence has touched everything from the Spanish military 
and national police to annual fiestas, the citizens' panels provide a welcome 
chance for rational discussion. They also have pushed ETA and its supporters, 
who claim to be the only true voice of the Basques, off center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "After what happened with Leizaran, something had to be done to deal with 
these issues in another way," said Dr. Inaki Ormazabal, a surgeon serving on a 
20-member panel that met for a week in Mondragon. 
</P>
<P>
 Panel members are being asked what they think should be done about the 25-mile 
stretch of road called GI-627, which snakes along the Deba River below 
farmhouses clinging to the mountainsides. About 100,000 people live in the 
narrow valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The road turns south from San Sebastian through Maltzaga to Urbina. 
Representatives of the Mondragon Cooperative Group, the valley's economic 
engine, testified that business and jobs will move out unless the road is 
widened to four lanes so it can handle 2,000 semitrailer trucks a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment is nearly 18% in Spain, highest in the 12-member European Union. 
The Basque provinces have had a particularly difficult time attracting 
investment and keeping jobs because of ETA extortion and the threat of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Conclusions reached by the panels are expected to weigh heavily in the final 
decision, but will not be binding on the regional government. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1993, a U.S. citizens' panel that studied President Clinton's 
health care reform program chose a broader plan pollsters had said the public 
would reject. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the opposite of a referendum or an opinion poll," said German 
sociologist Hans Harms, one of the consultants for the Basque study. 
</P>
<P>
 After such a thorough examination of the issues by participants, he said, "I'd 
bet that, when they present their report to the transport department, they will 
know more about this question than anyone in the government or elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on the highway project, which would cost nearly $400 million as now 
conceived, is expected in May.

LOVE LEADS TO CONGRESSIONAL PACT; WASHINGTON: THE GENTLEMAN FROM BUFFALO 
PROPOSED TO THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM STATEN ISLAND ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. SHE VOTED 
'AYE.'

 He dropped to his knees. She was flustered. It was a classic proposal scene -- 
except for the drone of debate on President Clinton's budget bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else would one representative ask another to marry him but on the House 
floor? At least that's what Bill Paxon figured when he was pondering the proper 
setting for the most important speech of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 His intended, Susan Molinari, didn't see it quite that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "She kept saying, 'Not here, I can't believe you're doing this now,' " Paxon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a little temporary nervous breakdown," Molinari said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she said was, 'Yes, I'll marry you, but get off the floor,' " Paxon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Love is not an emotion most people associate with Congress. But on July 3, 
before about 120 people, the gentleman from Buffalo will marry the gentlewoman 
from Staten Island, N.Y. -- uniting in holy matrimony two of the country's 
hottest political properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxon, 40, is chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, 
charged with winning House elections. Molinari, 36, is the face of the new GOP 
-- young, female, moderate, professional. She's increasingly in the capital 
spotlight, and back home her name was circulated for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Their wedding is carefully timed to fall during a congressional recess, well 
before the November election. It's also carefully placed -- at an inn in New 
Hope, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to get married in either one of our districts because we 
wanted to keep it very small," Molinari said. "It would be impossible in our 
political circumstances not to invite everyone who ever signed a petition for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly in his leadership role this year, Paxon has displayed a sharp 
partisan tongue. He calls Washington "the Disney World of the North" and says 
House Democrats are retiring because "they see the lynch mob coming down the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 The bubbly Molinari has a definite softening effect on him. Plainly put, he 
turns to mush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan has the great elective future, and she should. She is the best, most 
dynamic Republican in the country today," Paxon said earnestly. "As long as 
she'll let me mow the lawn at the White House when she's President, I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, love. He doesn't even mind that she's keeping her name. He thought it was 
funny when constituents gave him an apron that said "Mr. Molinari." 
</P>
<P>
 But the harmony isn't always perfect. She voted for the family leave bill last 
year; he opposed it. He backs term limits; she does not. She supports abortion 
rights; he does not. She voted for this year's ban on assault rifles; he 
opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to talk about it," Molinari said. "Now I think we just respect each 
other's differences." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a little lobbying that goes on," Paxon interjected. 
</P>
<P>
 "A little needling every now and then," Molinari conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 They are only the second pair of sitting House members to marry each other. 
Andy Jacobs of Indiana and Martha Keys of Kansas were the first. It didn't 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 "She lost her race and then she lost her Andy," Molinari said, with the air of 
someone who sees no chance that will happen to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxon is a bachelor; Molinari was divorced four years ago after a brief 
marriage. These days, her constituents are bombarding her with cards, gifts and 
good wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Molinari doesn't think they'll mind if she becomes the nation's first pregnant 
congresswoman, either. "As long as I'm married when I get pregnant, my 
constituents will be comfortable," she said with a giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional colleagues greeted the news with warmth and some glee. House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) halted the budget debate last August to 
announce the engagement. Democrat Eliot L. Engel of New York wished the pair 
"many healthy and happy children, and may they all grow up to be good 
Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Both partners in this match have been steeped in politics all their lives. 
Molinari's father was in the House for nearly a decade before becoming borough 
president of Staten Island. Paxon's father was an elected judge in the Buffalo 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying on the family business, Molinari was a New York City council member 
from 1986-90, then won her father's congressional seat. Paxon was 15 when he 
volunteered for his first campaign and 23 when he won election to the Erie 
County Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Their shared obsession, the two maintain, will make for a stronger marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two weeks before a recent special election in Kentucky, Molinari said, 
"I knew that there were times when Bill was just going to be shut off and that 
was his main focus. I can understand that and respect it and to some extent 
like that drivenness about him, because I'm in the same game."

RWANDA 'GENOCIDE' ON PROSCRIBED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has instructed its spokesmen not to describe the 
mass killings in Rwanda as "genocide" in order to avoid moral pressure to stop 
the bloodletting, the New York Times reported in Friday's edition. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 500,000 people are believed to have been slaughtered since early 
April in Rwanda -- most of them members of the minority Tutsi tribe -- by 
militias of the majority Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper said the Administration is unwilling to compare the massacres with 
notorious previous campaigns of genocide -- such as the killing of as many as 1 
million Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent such comparisons, the paper said the State Department and the 
National Security Council have drafted memos instructing spokesmen to say 
merely that "acts of genocide may have occurred."

GOP FORCES, WESTERN RANCHERS CIRCLE WAGONS AGAINST CLINTON ARROWS; POLITICS: 
PRESIDENT'S DETERMINATION TO REVISE A CENTURY OF POLICIES ON NATURAL RESOURCES 
HAVE PUT A SPECIAL BURDEN ON DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR OFFICE THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LAWRENCE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The talk was of fear and suspicion, of threats to rural customs and business, 
of breaking "the rhythms of spring" -- calving, branding, fence repairs -- to 
argue against yet another set of government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The anxious voices belonged to ranchers, but they might as well have been 
Republican political operatives. Their complaints form the basis of a popular 
campaign script titled "The War on the West." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's determination to revise a century of natural-resource 
policies has put a special burden on Western Democrats running for office this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In his "New West," Westerners would pay more for use of federal lands. 
Preserving the land would be a priority and some uses would be banned or 
limited. Those affected would include logging, mining, oil and gas companies as 
well as farmers, ranchers, hunters and off-road vehicle hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 The vision, cheering to environmentalists, looks downright apocalyptic from 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear is permeating our communities," rancher Pat O'Toole told Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt at a May 19 rangeland reform meeting in Casper. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan warned Babbitt to make sure that "change doesn't 
disrupt the things that we value," namely, the West's small-town, 
individualistic way of life. Sullivan, a Democrat, is running for the U.S. 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of higher grazing fees set off explosions last year in the West. 
But the fee question has been eclipsed by an even more alarming specter: the 
disappearance of the West as Westerners know it, or like to think of it. Thus, 
Democrats find themselves up against passions and symbolism, not mere policies. 
</P>
<P>
 They are showing plenty of creativity as they alternately try to prove that, 
(A) they won't be presidential pawns or, (B) they have Clinton's ear. 
Declarations of independence are interspersed with boasts such as these: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nevada Gov. Bob Miller says he had a pivotal conversation with Clinton about 
a gaming tax proposed to finance welfare reform. The tax, a potential disaster 
for Las Vegas, was subsequently scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sullivan complained directly to Clinton about Jim Baca, the abrasive 
director of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, which oversees 
federal rangelands. Baca was soon gone, challenging New Mexico Gov. Bruce King 
in the Democratic primary. He lost. 
</P>
<P>
 * Colorado Gov. Roy Romer takes credit for injecting more local control into 
the newest federal rangeland plan. He convened environmentalists and ranchers 
to develop a state policy on grazing fees and practices. Babbitt participated 
in eight sessions in eight weeks, then proposed a national system based on the 
Colorado model. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Westerners allow that perhaps grazing fees for cattle and sheep could be 
a little higher, or that it might be time to update an 1872 law that lets 
companies extract minerals from federal land at virtually no cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But overriding that is the conviction that their destiny is being plotted by 
an overzealous President and an interior secretary who may have been a Western 
governor once, but whose last job was president of the League of Conservation 
Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a two-way trust thing and right now we don't have it in either 
direction," said Frank Moore, president of the Wyoming Woolgrowers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster whose clients include Sullivan, Romer, 
Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan and North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad, said the 
Administration is still paying the price for its initial approach, which was 
confrontational and, from a strategic standpoint, thoughtless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been these ineffective detours of trying to play the Old West 
versus the New West," Garin said. "If they had it to do all over again, these 
policies would be presented much more in terms of preserving what's best about 
the West for future generations of Westerners." 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of the conflict lie in a century of Western history and development. 
Homesteaders claimed the most fertile territory and the federal government took 
over the rest. Its proprietary role cannot be overstated. The federal 
government owns half of Wyoming and nearly 90% of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformers contend low grazing fees on public land amount to subsidies the 
country can ill afford. They also argue that some ranchers are abusing the 
environment and need tighter federal supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Westerners say they are good environmental stewards and fiercely deny that 
they receive subsidies. Public land should cost less than private because it's 
usually less productive and has fewer services and improvements, they maintain. 
They further contend that Clinton's plans would threaten rural economies by 
throwing ranches, farms and mines out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the Administration's agenda has energized Western business 
interests and conservatives. Membership in one group representing their point 
of view, People for the West, has risen 65% -- to 20,000 -- since September. 
The number of chapters went from 77 to 110. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent GOP poll in New Mexico hints at the intensity of the opposition. 
Pollster Ed Goeas said he found an even split on grazing attitudes -- but those 
against the Administration plan felt twice as strongly as its supporters. That 
means they're more likely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton White House is not the first to antagonize the West. But an 
unusually large number of contentious issues is in play -- ranging from grazing 
fee increases to endangered species protection to a recent Forest Service 
regulation, later withdrawn, that limited firearms on federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The breadth and intensity of the war on the West is much stronger than it's 
ever been. It's a very broad assault," said Rep. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), 
Sullivan's aggressive Senate opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Democrats have been tempted to write off the West, but Clinton's 
situation is different: In 1992 he actually carried seven states in this 
region, more than he won in his native South. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd obviously like to hold them in 1996. And this year, with several Senate 
Democrats retiring, Clinton needs a couple of Western victories to make sure 
his party keeps control of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be too late to mend fences, but Babbitt nevertheless visits the West 
frequently to listen and soothe. He has adopted a gentler brand of rhetoric. He 
now talks of persuading Americans "to live a little more thoughtfully on the 
landscape," rather than asserting that they must. 
</P>
<P>
 But his persistence, and presumably Clinton's, is intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to end this warfare that's characterized these issues for the last 
100 years," Babbitt said after his battering at the Casper rangeland reform 
meeting. "There's no name they can call me that can keep me from talking to 
them. . . . I'm simply going to keep coming back."

WHEN PETS GET SICK AS A DOG, INSURANCE HELPS ON BILLS; ANIMALS: POLICY 
ELIMINATES DILEMMA FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CARING FOR PET 
AND FEEDING FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIMS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Bradley Wirth considers the health insurance he bought for Oliver 
Wendell Wirth -- a 15-year-old "terrier-poodle-cocker and, we've always said, 
Presbyterian" -- almost providential. 
</P>
<P>
 The All Saints Episcopal Church priest, concerned about Oliver's difficulty 
navigating steps, took the dog in for X-rays. Two large bladder stones were 
discovered, requiring surgery last January. 
</P>
<P>
 The $930 operation cost Wirth $176. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my role as a priest, I have seen people agonize over medical procedures 
for their pets," he said. "(Insurance) was an absolute godsend for us, and I 
think it would be for other folks." 
</P>
<P>
 Pet insurance costs an average of $75 a year, but it is unusual. Only one 
major multi-state carrier provides nationwide coverage, and a major insurer 
that had offered it quit because it sold few policies. Smaller plans, akin to 
HMOs, are springing up, however -- which is how Wirth covered Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such coverage, an owner may have to choose between healing his pet and 
feeding his family. Dr. Scott Matheson, medical director for the Family 
Veterinary Hospital's All Pet Complex in Taylorsville, Utah, noted that the 
cost of emergency veterinary medicine can exceed many clients' budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "A real common example is a dog or cat that gets hit by a car," he said. "If 
it has a single broken bone, it would not be uncommon to have surgery, and 
that's $800 to $1,000."  
</P>
<P>
 "We find that the vast majority of pet owners don't really take proper care of 
their pets," Matheson said. "A lot of times, the option that people choose is 
euthanasia. "That's frustrating when perhaps 80% of all euthanasias are 
unnecessary. We would rather be able to treat these animals and get them back 
to their families." 
</P>
<P>
 In a country that spent nearly $7 billion on veterinary care for dogs and cats 
in 1991, pet health insurance might seem to be a logical growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we think it's a great idea," said Katherine Brant, spokeswoman for 
the Humane Society of Utah. "Many people deeply devoted to their companion 
animals will quite often put their companion's health care needs ahead of their 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Family Veterinary Hospital launched a three-tiered dog and cat 
health plan. So far, more than 200 pet owners have signed up, and Matheson 
expects enrollment to reach 400 to 500 by year's end. Wirth is one of the 
policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works: A $10-a-month plan offers vaccinations, other routine 
treatments and savings on spays and neuters. For $7.50 more, the plan extends 
discounts to medical, surgical, prescription and laboratory services. A $25 
monthly payment covers the full cost of medical, surgical and lab work up to 
$500, and half the cost above that. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson said the prepaid options are more akin to human health maintenance 
organizations than to traditional third-party insurance plans, dozens of which 
have failed in the pet care market in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest to go under was the Fireman's Fund Insurance Co.'s Medipet program, 
which quit writing new policies on April 4. John Kozero, spokesman for the 
Novato, Calif.-based firm, said less than 7,000 pet owners signed up during a 
three-year trial run. 
</P>
<P>
 "An awful lot of people showed interest, but after they received the 
brochures, very few sent in checks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the nation's largest pet health insurer, Veterinary Pet Insurance, 
without major competition. The Anaheim, Calif., company has issued more than 
500,000 policies in 39 states since it was founded 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiums average $75 a year. "We cover accidents or illnesses. In that sense, 
it's pretty much the same as regular (human) health insurance," said Vice 
President Richard Stephens. "Elective surgeries, spays, neuters and routine 
care aren't covered." 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves plenty of room for small-scale, prevention-oriented pet health 
plans such as Matheson's. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Veterinary Medical Assn. recently appointed an executive panel to 
explore the pet insurance issue. "Everybody seems to be very interested in 
this," said spokesman Mike Walters, reached at the association's offices in 
Schaumburg, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the last year for which the AVMA has figures, Americans owned 52.5 
million dogs and 57 million cats. Dog owners spent nearly $4.6 billion on 
veterinary care; cat owners more than $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters argued that dogs and cats are better risks than people. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you consider that a lot of health problems may be the result of voluntary 
or discretionary but unsafe activities -- drinking, smoking or riding 
motorcycles without helmets -- animals don't engage in those activities," he 
said.

NEW WOES FOR SIAMESE TWINS' FATHER; TRAGEDY: ESTRANGED WIFE BAILS KENNETH 
LAKEBERG, AN ADMITTED DRUG- AND ALCOHOL-ABUSER, OUT OF JAIL FOR ANGELA'S 
FUNERAL MONDAY. HE FACES TRIAL ON AUTO THEFT CHARGES.

<P>
 Clutching a few belongings to his chest in a brown paper bag, Kenneth Lakeberg 
froze in front of the cameras that met him as he walked out of another jail. 
</P>
<P>
 After an awkward, silent moment, a frail hand grabbed Lakeberg's meaty forearm 
and pulled him toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just come on," Reitha Lakeberg snapped, leading her husband quickly past the 
reporters Thursday moments after stuffing $500 in wadded-up bills through a 
slot in a wall in the jail foyer. 
</P>
<P>
 About 17 hours after their Siamese-twin daughter died in a Philadelphia 
hospital, the couple and their 6-year-old daughter drove away from the Jasper 
County Jail to mourn the latest tragedy in their calamitous lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been sad all along," Fern O'Dor, the Lakebergs' sister-in-law, said 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Lakeberg died three weeks short of her first birthday, no family 
members at her side. She had lived 10 months since her twin, Amy, died in the 
operation that split them apart. Angela never made it out of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeberg, who began the day in a drug rehabilitation center, ended it free on 
bail and facing auto theft charges. The 27-year-old man hadn't seen Angela 
since last fall, before he spent six months in prison for violating probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Reitha Lakeberg, 25, had not visited Angela since Christmastime. Separated 
from her husband, she has been living with her parents near the rural 
northwestern Indiana town of Roselawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just like to thank everybody who has helped us and everyone who was 
concerned," she said as she waited for her husband at the jail, her hand 
trembling as she waved reporters away. 
</P>
<P>
 Fern O'Dor, Angela's aunt, said the last known visit to the girl from a family 
member was over the Easter weekend. Several family members were planning to 
drive to Philadelphia for a visit next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had kind of worked out a few vacation plans. We're not a wealthy family 
and we just can't afford to fly back and forth," said O'Dor's husband, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 Given just a 1% chance of surviving after the operation, Angela surprised her 
doctors at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She had been in serious but 
stable condition for months, using a ventilator to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 But the oxygen level in her blood dropped in recent days, and her condition 
deteriorated sharply Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew she was sick, but we didn't expect this," Fern O'Dor said. "We 
thought the worst was over." 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are set for Monday in Merrillville. Angela will be buried in 
the same cemetery where Amy was laid to rest in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a bad time for a while," said Mrs. Lakeberg's mother, Reitha 
Studer. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the twins, intertwined in each other's arms after their birth 
June 29, 1993, has been juxtaposed against their father's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 An admitted drug- and alcohol-abuser, Lakeberg was given a year's probation in 
May, 1993, after being accused of slashing a cousin's hand with a butcher knife 
the previous Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Lakeberg tested positive for cocaine, a probation violation. He 
skipped a hearing on the violation in October -- later saying he was too high 
to attend -- and was sent to prison after turning himself in later the same 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released in April, and has been staying with friends and relatives 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 He also admitted last year that he used about $1,300 in money donated to help 
defray the twins' medical costs on a three-day cocaine binge around the time of 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest problems began May 31, when he borrowed a friend's car and did not 
return it. Lakeberg turned himself in June 3 at a drug rehabilitation center in 
Lafayette. He was transferred to jail on Thursday.

MALL OF AMERICA HONES SKILLS OF ENTREPRENEURS; EDUCATION: CONCEPT OF STUDYING 
BUSINESS AT BUSINESSES IS LIKENED TO SPECIALIZED CLASSES AT TECHNICAL SCHOOLS 
OR LEARNING ZOOLOGY AT ZOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Hiram Bonet ducks out of class at noon and heads for the Mall of America, 
he's not skipping school to shop or ride the roller coaster at the seven-acre 
amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 His trip is legit. The 17-year-old is learning business skills from the 
experts -- those who run the nation's largest enclosed shopping mall and 
entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonet, a junior at Bloomington's Kennedy High School, is one of 15 students 
enrolled in a course in entrepreneurship and business at the mall's new 
learning center. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are pursuing career interests and getting a flavor of what it's like," 
said Jerry Cromer-Poire, a social studies teacher from St. Paul Central High 
School who teaches the pilot course. "We're not involved in flipping 
hamburgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Students spend mornings in regular classes at their home schools, then go to 
the mall for classes and internships with businesses Monday through Thursday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cromer-Poire's students, internships can be as varied as the 400-plus 
businesses in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 A student interested in sports medicine works at a sports equipment store. A 
student considering a career in jewelry-making works at a jewelry store. Others 
help manage restaurants, sell clothes and recycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The center opened in January and plans by next fall to offer several courses 
to about 100 students from five districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Each class will have a real-world partner. The pilot class is being offered 
with the mall's developers and operations staff. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental issues class will get help from Browning-Ferris Industries, 
which collects and recycles the mall's garbage. An arts in the marketplace 
class will work with the Camp Snoopy amusement park in the middle of the mall, 
which offers plays and musical performances along with its rides. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of taking business classes at the mall isn't much different from 
taking other specialized classes at vocational-technical schools or taking 
zoology classes at the zoo, Cromer-Poire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to go in at management level. The idea of making 
decisions, of getting involved in change, is very important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That has captured the imagination of Bonet, who is interning with operations 
-- the people who run the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted a broad-based view of what it takes to run the Mall of 
America," said Bonet, who plans to major in business in college. After that, he 
says, he may go into business law. "What areas of business, I wasn't sure. 
That's why I took this class." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonet has worked with the mall's tourism department, selling the mall to 
potential visitors; the sponsorship department, persuading businesses to 
sponsor events in return for advertising; public relations and events planning, 
and sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he sees the stamp of businesses everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go into Camp Snoopy I notice the 'Hormel' Cookout, the 'Ford' 
Playhouse. The hot-air balloons say 'Pepsi.' It's in your face," Bonet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're learning because you want to learn, not because someone's trying to 
force it. In a regular classroom, you focus so much on the work that you forget 
to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "This class will look wonderful on a college application." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses using student interns also are pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gotreau, manager of Tony Roma's restaurant, is training a student in 
restaurant operations and wants her to see all sides of the business -- 
including busing dishes, hostessing and working in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to come work in these businesses, they can't get just a 
one-sided slant," he said. "She has a keen interest in what's going on. I wish 
all of my employees were like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy Richeson, manager of the Gap Kids store, is teaching an intern the 
tricks of the children's clothing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's learning about the product, how to sell the product. She's aware of the 
dollars we need to do, what we need to do to beat our last year's dollars. 
She's learning what we're all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Cromer-Poire said students aren't distracted by other things at the mall. On 
classroom days, the students get a 10-minute break halfway through the period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never lost anybody yet," he said. "The attendance rate is wonderful. The 
kids are all motivated. They all try hard. I see kids talking more concretely 
about college plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonet said his parents were skeptical at first when he told them he wanted to 
attend a class at the mall. "Until I brought home the books. They found out it 
was a legitimate class and not just a way to waste time." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who want to shop or play at the mall can do so on their own time. But 
Bonet said most of the students have jobs and other responsibilities when 
school is over, so they don't hang around the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get a feel of what our school is all about, if you're truly 
interested in entrepreneurship, there's no way that you'd skip to do something 
else," he said.

GOTTI LAWYER PLACED IN HOUSE ARREST, FINED $5,000 ON GAG ORDER VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Gotti's lawyer was sentenced Friday to 90 days under house arrest for 
talking to reporters during the mob boss's 1991 trial. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Thomas Platt also fined Bruce Cutler $5,000, barred him 
from the state's Eastern District courts for six months, ordered him to perform 
600 hours of community service and placed him on probation for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler could have been sentenced to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel their entire case should never have been brought and feel it will be 
overturned in appeal," said Cutler's lawyer, Frederick Hafetz. "The prosecutor 
never proved that Bruce violated the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Platt found Cutler guilty of disregarding three gag orders issued 
by U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser during the murder-racketeering trial that 
resulted in Gotti's life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasser removed Cutler from Gotti's case after prosecutors labeled him "house 
counsel" to the Gambino crime family, headed by Gotti, and said he could be 
called as a witness. Cutler did not testify.

H. ANDERSON; FATHER IN 'DENNIS THE MENACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Herbert Anderson, a versatile movie and stage actor who was best known as the 
owlish father of television's "Dennis the Menace," died Saturday. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson died in his sleep at his home in Palm Springs. He had suffered a 
stroke about two months ago, said family spokesman Mike Vest. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Oakland, Anderson acted in a number of Broadway, television and 
movie roles but was best known as Henry Mitchell from the 1959-1963 CBS series. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what people remember," Anderson said in a 1992 interview. "A waitress 
once came up to me and said: 'I used to dream I'd have a father like you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson retired in 1982 following heart surgery and moved to Palm Springs in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 His acting career began with Warner Bros. in 1939, and his big break came in 
1941 with the musical comedy "Navy Blues," starring Ann Sheridan and Martha 
Raye. A year later he played a college newspaper editor in "The Male Animal" 
with Olivia de Havilland and Henry Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson also played Dr. Bird in the 1953 Broadway production of the "Caine 
Mutiny Court Martial," which also starred Henry Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he and his TV wife, Gloria Henry, read "Dennis the Menace" 
scripts from a parent's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times, Gloria or I would read what Dennis was supposed to do and we'd 
say, 'If my kid did that, I'd whack him,' " Anderson said. "And the writers 
would cut that part out. They listened to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is survived by his wife, Mary; a daughter, Babbie Anderson of 
Huntington Beach; a son, Nick Anderson of Frenchtown, Mont.; four grandchildren 
and two great-grandchildren.

G. WILLIAM MARSHALL; ACTOR, PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 G. William Marshall, an American actor and producer whose marriages to film 
stars probably made him better known than his dramatic career, has died, it was 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, whose four wives included Ginger Rogers and Michele Morgan, died 
Wednesday, according to a legal notice placed by his family in the Parisian 
newspaper Le Figaro.The place and cause of death were not announced. He was 
believed to be 76. Other information was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was placed by Mike Marshall, his son by Morgan, his first 
wife, and Tonie Marshall, his daughter by his second wife, actress Micheline 
Presle. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime vocalist with the Fred Waring orchestra was also married to Rogers 
and actress Corinne Aboyneau and was a friend of Clark Gable, Errol Flynn and 
Marilyn Monroe. He became Rogers' fifth husband in 1961 in a North Hollywood 
church ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 He recounted his professional and marital life in his 1983 memoirs, "The Sixth 
Season." Morgan took him to court to have intimate passages about their life 
together removed from the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Chicago, Marshall started his career with Waring in 1936. The next 
year, Marshall was leading his own band, and he began making film appearances 
in 1940 with "Flowing Gold" and "Santa Fe Trail." 
</P>
<P>
 His credits are often confused with those of another actor of the same name, 
who has appeared in films since the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall's other acting credits include "Belle of the Yukon" in 1944; "State 
Fair" in 1945; "Murder in the Music Hall," "Earl Carroll Sketchbook" and "That 
Brennan Girl," all in 1946, and "Calendar Girl" and "Blackmail" in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall directed and produced "Adventures of Captain Fabian" in 1951, and he 
directed "The Phantom Planet" in 1961.

DANA PARSONS: 6-YEAR-OLD SHOULDN'T BE TARGETED AS PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You've read a lot about what a holy terror Jimmy Peters is. Maybe you even saw 
the news coverage of parents picketing his return to school this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy is 6. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, they picketed a 6-year-old. Or, as one of Jimmy's classmates 
said to his mom when he saw the TV coverage, "Is Jimmy going to jail? Has Jimmy 
been bad?" 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, the parents would say they're not picketing Jimmy; no, they're protesting 
the federal judge's ruling that reinstated Jimmy after the Ocean View School 
District in Huntington Beach wouldn't allow him in a regular classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if that distinction wasn't lost on Jimmy as he made his way through 
the picket line to kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 And the parents contend Jimmy is disrupting education? 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have said that Jimmy, who has a language disability, is prone 
to violence and disruptive outbursts that endanger his classmates and make him 
unfit for a regular classroom. He's been suspended twice this spring, once for 
a day and once for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of what we've seen and read so far has come from school officials and 
parents who describe Jimmy as a biting, yelling, spitting, kicking, 
tantrum-throwing menace. They depict a classroom where learning comes to a stop 
because Jimmy is there. 
</P>
<P>
 I must have missed the pickets against all those other kindergartners who 
pinch, bite and spit or hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, not many of us could argue that we'd want our children in a class 
like that. One student shouldn't be able to terrorize a class, notwithstanding 
that such scenarios have existed in classrooms since time immemorial. 
</P>
<P>
 But that assumes that Jimmy is all those things. 
</P>
<P>
 What you need to know is that not everyone concurs with that picture of him. 
And once you know that, it leads to all sorts of interesting things to ponder 
about why Jimmy has been targeted as Public Enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Jimmy's defense so far has come from his father, who has characterized 
some of the district's allegations against his son as lies. OK, you say, his 
father would be expected to defend his child. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me introduce you to some other people. 
</P>
<P>
 One is Patricia Donnelly, who has a child in Jimmy's class. She asked her son 
if Jimmy ever hit anyone, and her son said no. She asked if Jimmy threw a 
table, as was alleged, and he said no. Her son said Jimmy "talks loud 
sometimes" but that other kids do bad stuff, too. She said that, "Neither I nor 
my husband believe that Jimmy is dangerous or constitutes a danger for our 
son." 
</P>
<P>
 Another is Nicki Akstinas, whose son is also Jimmy's classmate. She said her 
son never mentioned that Jimmy was a problem. Her son, she said, is not afraid 
of Jimmy and refers to Jimmy as his friend. Mrs. Akstinas said she has been in 
Jimmy's class many times for brief periods and saw other children being more 
disruptive than she saw Jimmy being. 
</P>
<P>
 A third parent, Deborah Hoops, said her 9-year-old daughter has played with 
Jimmy for up to two hours at a time and that her 6-year-old son has gone to the 
beach with Jimmy and considers him a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks of Mmes. Donnelly, Akstinas and Hoops were delivered under oath 
and given to the judge who ruled in Jimmy's favor. A fourth woman, Elaine 
Bauman, has been Jimmy's baby-sitter for several months. She factors into this 
because one of the school employees, in her statement to the court, said Jimmy 
bit her, a teacher and Bauman. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is Bauman's under-oath statement to the court: "I . . . adamantly deny 
that Jimmy either hit or bit me as reported." 
</P>
<P>
 These testimonials may confuse more than enlighten. 
</P>
<P>
 They raise this question with me: Is this supposedly horribly disruptive 
6-year-old invisible to some of his classmates? 
</P>
<P>
 Further, once it is established that not all parents are upset with Jimmy, 
isn't there a huge burden of proof to justify segregating him? 
</P>
<P>
 In her successful defense of Jimmy's right to return to his class, Tustin 
attorney Joan Honeycutt referred to school officials' "untruthful, misleading 
and exaggerated statements . . . which have painted a picture of Jimmy as some 
type of dangerous, loathsome monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Honeycutt told me late last week that school officials did a terrible job of 
preparing Jimmy's teachers and support staff with the challenges he presented 
them. Then, when parents joined the fray, Honeycutt said, school officials 
"sacrificed Jimmy, threw him to the wolves." 
</P>
<P>
 We could argue this all day. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I'm not arguing that every child automatically belongs in a mainstream 
class. Some are simply too unruly or emotionally disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 But before segregating a 6-year-old kindergartner with a disability, 
especially one whose allegedly violent acts toward other students seem no more 
egregious than those seen in school every day, I want overwhelming evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In that regard, it was interesting to read the picket signs the parents held. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about my child's education?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids have rights." 
</P>
<P>
 "Protect our kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy's dad couldn't have said it any better.

ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rare birds--Spring got off to a slow start, as far as local birders are 
concerned. But in the last few days of April and on into early May, rare bird 
sightings suddenly took off around the county, according to the monthly report 
compiled by Doug Willick for the National Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 At Huntington Central Park on May 7, eight black swifts were seen, as was a 
male purple martin. Black swifts are seldom seen in migration, and have never 
before been spotted at the heavily birded park. Purple martins have seriously 
declined in numbers throughout California (another purple martin was seen April 
10 at Upper Newport Bay). 
</P>
<P>
 Two adult reddish egrets have turned up in the county. One was spotted during 
a shorebird census at the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge on April 24, and 
a second bird has been seen at Bolsa Chica starting April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other April and May sightings: merlins at Peter's Canyon Regional Park, a 
flock of Pacific golden plovers wintering in Seal Beach, great-tailed grackles 
at Huntington Central Park and a white-throated sparrow in Chino Hills State 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The April 30 Audubon Bird-A-Thon turned up some highlights as well: a 
zone-tailed hawk over Santiago Oaks Regional Park, a northern fulmar swimming 
off the end of the Newport Pier, along withseveral parasitic jaegers flying 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Trail day--Volunteers are needed for a special trail maintenance day Saturday, 
from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park. Registered 
volunteers will get T-shirts for taking part, so call ahead to REI, one of the 
event's sponsors, at (714) 543-4142.

 When the shuttle Endeavor drifted overhead last January, one of the astronauts 
routinely described the lights of Los Angeles and San Francisco on the planet 
below. And then: 
</P>
<P>
 ". . .Las Vegas coming into view. Las Vegas is outrageously bright. You can 
see the strip from 350 miles." 
</P>
<P>
 Under those lights, tens of thousands of Americans flick their hold cards at 
blackjack tables, shove their bets to the red or black at roulette, roll the 
dice at crap tables and slide their nickels and dollars into the always 
promising slot machines. They shop at fancy shops and dine at gourmet 
restaurants and cheap buffets. 
</P>
<P>
 But what would happen if, by some fluke of political fortune or public 
attitude or excessive competition from Mississippi riverboats and the casinos 
on Indian reservations, this queen city of gambling should go belly up? 
</P>
<P>
 Does the state of Nevada, which gets 40% of its income from Las Vegas and Reno 
casinos, have a contingency plan? Does this state, which gets its second most 
lucrative revenue from mining, have alternative sources of revenue? 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Gluck, board chairman of Caesars World, the casino giant, was asked what 
Nevada would do if the United States banned all gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secede from the Union," he said without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truth is Las Vegas and Nevada have thought ahead, not always 
seriously, but somewhat successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 They successfully lured 115 companies to their desert valleys in 1993, some 
small ones escaping the high taxes of California, and some big credit card 
operations like Citibank looking for low-rent districts with good 
communications and inexpensive labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada's convention and trade show business is booming, thanks to low-cost 
hotel space and huge exhibit arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 The casino hotels themselves are making forays into family entertainment, and 
megashopping malls with hundreds of shops catering to all tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Kerkorian's theme park at his new MGM Grand is aimed at the family and 
Caesars' expansion of its Forum of shops is impressive, but whatever the hotel 
casinos offer, all paths still lead through the casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 More important are new buildings rising outside the shadows of the 
casino-hotels and housing enterprises such as Citibank and Household Credit and 
Ocean Spray. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen years ago when the prospect arose of a twin gaming city on the 
boardwalks of Atlantic City, there was no panic in the streets, but there was a 
small tremor of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Robert Miller, a proponent of diversification of the state's economy, 
remembers it well. "They said there wouldn't be any room for Las Vegas or 
Nevada or Reno," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they said, the old lady of the Atlantic would siphon off all the gaming 
money from the huge East Coast population centers. Jets would stop jetting to 
Las Vegas; junkets would dry up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously that has not turned out to be the case," Miller said. "They 
regulate in a different fashion than we do; they're a little more restrictive. 
. .Very few of those properties have been profitable, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas and Nevada have a history with the gaming industry, good times and 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew with the industry. That's something no one else is going to be able 
to do. . . .We grew up with the baby and we kind of matured with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, the big players in the gaming industry are quite comfortable in the 
Nevada milieu. "There's one thing about Nevada that is unique: The cooperation 
of the regulatory body (the gaming commission) and the political process has 
been extraordinary," said Caesars' Gluck. 
</P>
<P>
 What would take years to gain approval in other states, Gluck said, can be 
done sometimes in six months in Nevada, where the state Legislature meets every 
second year but where the state government is keenly aware that gaming allows 
the state to finance its operations without an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, three new casinos have blossomed in the glitter at an 
average cost of about $1 billion apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Soaring over the Las Vegas strip is Kerkorian's latest extravaganza, the MGM 
Grand, its leonine maw forming the main entrance, acres and acres of slot 
machines and gaming tables and restaurants and theaters with Dorothy's trip 
through Oz one of the main themes. Its 5,000 rooms and mini-theme park, though 
lacking Disneyesque proportions, does hint at family entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're close to 90,000 rooms in Las Vegas and still climbing," Gluck said, 
"with a very strong infrastructure, with highways and airports and things like 
that. That's very difficult for anyone to duplicate in the short run." 
</P>
<P>
 There are nearly 30,000 more hotel rooms on the drawing boards, and the number 
of visitors to Las Vegas has nearly doubled in 10 years to 23 million. They 
spent, one way or the other, almost $15 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Caesars World isn't hedging its bets. It has a contract in Windsor, 
Ont., across the river from Detroit, in partnership with Hilton and Circus 
Circus. It is currently bidding in Greece, and in Michigan City, Ind., and St. 
Louis, where there is county option for casino gambling. Caesars is also at 
work with the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians in Palm Springs, waiting 
for the courts to decide just how far reservation gaming can go. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean it is ignoring its Las Vegas operation. It has plans for a 
Magical Empire, an enterprise built entirely around magicians and conjurers and 
dining with theaters attached, patterned after the Magic Castle in Los Angeles. 
It's due to open next spring to 3,500 guests a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year they will begin to renovate the main entrance to create ancient 
Roman villas, becoming a kind of casino within a casino, called "Casino of the 
Gods." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are to knock out a wall of the 240,000-square-foot Forum, a shopping 
mall of immense proportions, to add another 160,000 square feet, where a square 
foot brings in an average of $900 in sales per month. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't match the Mall of America's 4.2 million square feet and 352 stores 
in Minnesota, but this, after all, is a back yard operation to the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesars' mall does offer some surcease from gambling as the lighted sky passes 
day by day overhead on the vast and vaulted ceiling and the god Bacchus 
celebrates periodically with his court, statues come to life, under a 
laser-lighted dome. On the way out, visitors pass through the casinos again. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Gluck is bemused by the idea. When he walks through Caesars he is always 
in a business suit, distinguishing him from the casual tourist, so people seek 
him out for questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two most frequent questions," he said, "are, 'How do I get out of here?' 
and, 'Where is the men's room?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, next door at the Mirage and Treasure Island hotels, both owned by 
Golden Nugget, make-believe takes another turn. A volcano erupts from 
waterfalls and a full-size British Man of War sails into view to do battle with 
a pirate vessel, both fully manned by actors, in front of what one might 
suppose is a Caribbean port. The Brits go down to a watery grave after verbal 
and fireworks salvos while a recorded band plays "Rule Britannia," arising from 
the water again to the same melody. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street in a make-believe and turreted Camelot, the hotel Excalibur 
takes an Arthurian theme. Luxor is ancient Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever face they paint on the old lady, it all boils down to gambling 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 As it now stands, all the gaming and sales tax revenues are collected by the 
state and doled out to the other jurisdictions. Las Vegas and other cities 
cannot levy taxes of their own, nor sell bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Las Vegas, with a population of about 900,000 in a state of 1.3 million, 
generates the lion's share of state revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas Mayor Jan Laverty Jones, who will run against Miller for governor in 
the fall, would like to revise the constitution to give more power to the 
cities. She said her city has an image problem and wonders whether big business 
would really want to locate there. 
</P>
<P>
 "People perceive Las Vegas as just a growing Sin City," she said. "They think 
we don't have neighborhoods, we don't go to school. You have to overcome that 
perception first. Secondarily, because we have never funded education to what I 
believe are appropriate levels, in many cases we can't provide that pool of 
technically and professionally trained employees to attract businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a period of time during which Las Vegas will still be the 
major resort-gambling destination. We're so far ahead of the other 
jurisdictions. If you don't take that time to diversify the economic base, to 
really look at how we're going to structure the government and what we're going 
to try to build, we haven't faced up to our problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones looks at the possibility of gambling around the country, especially in 
California, and it worries her. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may still come to Las Vegas for their mini-vacations, but they'll 
shorten their stay," she said. "And if gaming goes into California, should that 
ever happen, and if you look at the percentage of Las Vegas tourism that 
depends on California, it becomes a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Cortez, the chairman of the Las Vegas Convention Bureau, is more 
sanguine about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is certainly no secret that 40% of our visitor volume comes from 
California," he said. "It's our closest drive-in market. But I think that the 
resort industry has in fact diversified our economy by expanding and adding 
more events. At one time, and rightfully so, Las Vegas was looked at as a 
single-purpose destination, a gaming destination, the world's best, but a 
single-purpose destination nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still a gaming destination; don't misunderstand me. Gaming is the 
little engine that drives our economy. But we're diversified within the leisure 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 With the building of the MGM Grand, Cortez said, Las Vegas went from being the 
No. 1 gaming destination to being a major resort destination. 
</P>
<P>
 He is proud, too, of the convention business, which accounts for about 12% of 
the 23 million visitors Las Vegas draws each year. There are few cities that 
can accommodate the 90,000 people that the biggest trade shows and conventions 
bring in. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Carlson, who heads the Economic Development Commission, is in charge of 
luring new business to the state. He is interested in permanent residents, 
permanent businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've had a tremendous amount of luck in bringing industry into this 
community as well as the state," he said. That growth, he added, is due in 
large part to companies relocating from California to avoid taxes and 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 When Citibank wanted to set up a credit card operation, it looked to New 
Mexico first. But New Mexico wouldn't change its banking laws; Carlson got wind 
of the trouble and placed a call to Citibank. The governor called a special 
session of the Legislature and was able to change the rules in nine weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today their building sits up on West Sahara Avenue employing 2,000 people," 
Carlson said. Since then, Household Credit has come to Nevada and built a 
150,000-square-foot building northwest of Las Vegas to handle the GM Card 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two led the way for other credit-card companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Spray is building a plant to produce its drinks and syrups and Lockheed 
has opened a technical engineering and design operation near Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Carlson said, the hundred-plus new companies and 29 existing ones 
created more than 5,300 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carlson is quick to explain that the new enterprises won't eclipse the 
gaming industry. "That's not our goal," he said. "Our goal is to strengthen the 
economy, to back up our major industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Miller, whose father was a casino part-owner in the early days, recalls 
"the rough-and-ready guys" of early Las Vegas and the emergence of the Mafia 
with Bugsy Siegel who took it "from a back room operation and built a hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the state has created a gaming commission to investigate the 
ownership of the casino-hotels, a commission that Miller said is "the best 
regulatory mechanism in the world. Everyone who considers legalizing gaming 
comes and studies Nevada now." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Hughes introduced "a bottom line" assessment of every operation, and 
that in turn led to companies going public and having to answer to Wall Street 
and stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez sees a benefit from Las Vegas' not-so-holy past. It is part of the 
mystique, he said, the ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never going to go away," he said. "So I think we ought to use it to our 
best advantage."

ELECTORATE GIVING JUDGES A FREE RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was shocked by the article ("Electorate Is Being Denied Right to Vote," 
May 30) about the number of judges being returned to office with the electorate 
being kept deliberately unaware of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 I have checked with the Orange County registrar's office, and it appears that 
in Orange County 17 Superior Court judges and nine Municipal Court judges are 
getting a free ride for another six years.The Superior Court judges receive 
about $99,000 per year and the Municipal Court judges about $90,000 per year, 
plus perks and retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize that many people feel that the judiciary should not be politicized, 
but in California it already is. Apparently attorneys are loath to run against 
sitting judges, even if they feel they can do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, we should have the right to confirm (or not) a judge returning to 
another term. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge behaving with propriety and who interprets the law, but does not make 
law, would have no worry. But the California economy doesn't need another 
sinecure or political-plum reward -- we do need efficient courts.

GOP WANTS TO END LIBERALS' SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A backlash of conservatism is building in the United States to counter the 
extravagance caused by the unrealistic policies of the idealistic but naive 
liberals of the past and present. Views such as those expressed by Mark 
Petracca of Irvine (Letters, June 5), clearly demonstrate the lack of logical 
thinking by adherents of the liberal philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Petracca needs to take a primer course in economics. The largest costs to 
communities in Orange County are those directly attributed to congressionally 
mandated welfare and immigration programs. How can Orange County community 
treasuries become fiscally sound when there is no control of illegal 
immigration and out-of-control welfare spending? 
</P>
<P>
 So, Mr. Petracca, what Republican candidates in Orange County are advocating 
is to encourage the electorate to reduce government waste by voting out of 
office the big liberal spenders in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they are asking for your vote at the local level to continue their 
fight for fiscal responsibility. Now, do you get it, Mr. Petracca?

'NONPARTISAN' A MISNOMER FOR RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Reading the newspapers last Thursday morning ("Silva Picks Up Tillotson's 
Endorsement," June 9) should make Democrats supporting Linda Moulton Patterson 
in her "nonpartisan" race for (Orange County) supervisor face reality. Get mad 
and get even! 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no such thing as a nonpartisan race in Orange County," said 
Supervisor William G. Steiner. County Supervisor Roger Stanton warned local 
business people that Moulton Patterson, by virtue of her Democratic Party 
affiliation, represented a serious threat to the board's conservative style of 
governing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jim Silva, the other candidate for county supervisor in our District 2, 
obviously welcomes Republican help, must Moulton Patterson shun evidence of 
political affiliation? 
</P>
<P>
 I say "No." She should welcome the support of the 89,456 Democrats in District 
2, go after the 941 Greens, the 1,988 Libertarians, the 4,514 American 
Independents, the 859 Peace and Freedom voters, the 310 miscellaneous and of 
course the 26,773 nonpartisan or "decline to state" voters -- and yes, 
Republicans. Within those 249,953 Republican voters, there must be a lot who 
care more about issues than party affiliation. Republicans should recognize 
that the county, as an administrative unit of the state, will benefit by having 
at least one supervisor with Democratic credibility to make Orange County's 
case with the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The county loses at least $45 million each year because the state's allocation 
policy on health and welfare services was formulated years ago, when Orange 
County Republican leadership refused state and federal funds. Too late, the 
Republican leadership recognized there was unemployment, homelessness and 
poverty in wealthy Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the state's fiscal crunch, the Republican supervisors have not been 
able to change the formula. Orange County continues not to receive appropriate 
allocation of funds as do other counties.

FINGER OF SHAME POINTED AT NON-VOTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * South Africans stood in line for miles, hours and days to vote for the first 
time. It is a disgrace that U.S. citizens who always have had that privilege to 
vote just don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you women who fight so hard to have your voice heard in this society, 
but don't take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you African Americans who have been fighting hundreds of years to 
have your voice heard but don't take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on the Christian Church who God has given a responsibility and duty to 
the government (Romans 13) and who has given an opportunity to have your voice 
heard and don't take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you conservatives and liberals who blame each other for the way 
society has become with the decline of morals and values but did not take the 
opportunity to make a difference and have your voice heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you pro-life, pro-abortionists, environmentalist, animal rights, and 
any other activist group who could have made a difference but chose not to have 
their voice heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you who just don't care or are lazy, you could have made your voice 
heard to have the right to sit on your butt for the rest of your life. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you who feel apathy, disgust or dissatisfaction with the candidates, 
so you just don't vote. Not voting is a vote for the other side, which you will 
probably complain about after they are voted into office. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no good reasons for not voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on all of you!

VOTER TURNOUT A SORRY LESSON IN CIVICS; CLOSE ELECTION RACES IN THE COUNTY 
DEMONSTRATE THAT EVERY BALLOT DOES COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman in Maine, explaining her absence from the voting booth said, "I don't 
vote -- it only encourages them." Well, candidates, and the community, didn't 
get much encouragement in Orange County last Tuesday. Only three out of every 
10 registered voters bothered to go to the polls. That's an all-time low in 
voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the reason was apathy, disgust, disinterest, or whatever, it's a sorry 
lesson in civics. 
</P>
<P>
 If the voters who stayed home don't think their vote counted, just look at the 
election results -- and ask some of the candidates about the value of one vote. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in Dana Point, where 12 candidates were running for three seats 
on the City Council, Ernest A. Nelson missed being elected by just 20 votes out 
of more than 19,000 in the city's 31 precincts. That's less than one vote per 
precinct. 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened in the bitterly contested race for the Republican 
nomination in the 70th Assembly District where nomination is tantamount to 
election. Thomas G. Reinecke came in just 250 votes behind Marilyn C. Brewer 
out of 40,321 cast in the district's 350 voting precincts. Losing in the same 
way were the Democratic nominee in the 46th Congressional District and several 
candidates in Central Committee races. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 46th District, Robert J. Banuelos, who was the nominee in 1992, lost by 
just 142 votes out of 15,638 votes cast in the district's 259 precincts. 
Alberta Christy running for election to the Republican Central Committee in the 
69th District lost by less than one vote per precinct as did two Democratic 
Central Committee candidates in the 67 and 68th districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the results could change. There are still thousands of absentee 
ballots to be counted before the election is declared official. A few more of 
the votes cast could help change the outcome of some of the races. The votes 
not cast certainly did.

ORANGE SCHOOL BOARD MUST FACE PROBLEMS; IT'S TIME TO HIRE SUPERINTENDENT, GET 
EDUCATION ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another tumultuous school year is about to end in Orange, Villa Park and the 
other communities served by the Orange Unified School District. It has been a 
long time since there has been anything like normalcy, and unfortunately there 
are no signs of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the district's teachers and students can prepare for summer 
vacation, school board members need to work harder on solving problems. An 
obvious place to start is hiring a new superintendent. It has been more than 
two years since the district had a permanent chief, and the long lack of 
leadership is showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Four new board members took office last December. They have had enough time to 
learn the ropes; it is time to act. One of the newcomers, Max Reissmueller, 
used an unfortunate metaphor recently in describing the task confronting him 
and his colleagues. Reissmueller said the district needed restructuring, and it 
was necessary to tear down an old building to construct a new one. But he is 
wrong about that. The board instead should build on the solid foundation it 
already has: experienced, dedicated teachers, concerned and committed parents, 
and good test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger is that the foundation will erode as the board dithers. One board 
member correctly observed recently that many teachers who signed up with the 
district when they were in their 20s and 30s are now in their 50s and getting 
ready to retire. The teachers have won good benefits from the district over the 
years, balancing less than generous salaries. But they have given as well as 
they received -- quality education for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing those teachers will be difficult, especially with the poor public 
image of the district as a place racked by political infighting and public 
bickering. An education consultant who recruits school superintendents across 
the country and twice has tried to get a new superintendent for the Orange 
district said some candidates simply were not interested because of the 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of that trouble linger everywhere. In recent years, a maintenance 
supervisor has been indicted on charges of misappropriating public funds, and 
four board members were faulted by the Orange County Grand Jury for not 
stopping the diversion. There was a teachers' strike in 1988 and an attempted 
recall of board members two years ago. Three top administrators have been 
embroiled in allegations of sexual harassment or not reporting it; the three 
have filed a $60-million lawsuit against the district. Non-teaching workers 
struck for 10 days last month, virtually halting bus and child-care services. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles have beset a district once considered a model for public schools, 
and schools are a primary reason people moved to Orange. The kind of problems 
the district has suffered give ammunition to movements like the one aimed at 
giving parents vouchers to help pay to send their children to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana board members should also learn a lesson from Orange. Supt. Rudy M. 
Castruita is leaving Santa Ana, where he has done a good job, for San Diego. 
Castruita said the constant criticism by two members of the five-person board 
was not a factor in his leaving, but a number of his supporters said the 
carping took its toll. Surely any potential superintendents will think long and 
hard about taking a job where they may be attacked by board members trying to 
advance an agenda other than public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange board members should face their problems. It's time to hire a new 
superintendent and get education back on track.

SANTA MARGARITA WATER CHAIRMAN SAYS CHECK FACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Customers of the Santa Margarita Water District are being asked to sell 
local control of their water and sewer system to a New Jersey-based 
corporation. Privatization, consolidation, reduced debt or district downsizing 
may be just four solutions our community may consider in determining the 
operation of its water and sewer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But a New Jersey-headquartered company, American Water Works, says it knows, 
without public input, what is best for the customers of Santa Margarita Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 This company is canvassing neighborhoods and making slick promises of low 
rates without having any financial information from the Santa Margarita Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 What we do know about the company is that it has assets valued at over $3 
billion, its shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and, if it 
purchases the Santa Margarita Water District, it answers to its stockholders, 
not the residents who live here. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey-based American Water Works Co. is circulating petitions to 
initiate Local Agency Formation Commission proceedings to dissolve the Santa 
Margarita Water District without a local election. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Water District is receptive to any plan that offers the 
best deal to our customers. But we think our customers are smart enough to look 
at all the proposals and make a decision at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 We urge customers of the Santa Margarita Water District to not sign away their 
rights to a locally operated water and sewer system. Let's look at all the 
information together as a community and make decisions based upon realistic 
facts -- not slick, empty promises.

HEARTENING COORDINATION IN TB FIGHT; STATE, COUNTY HEALTH OFFICIALS' SERIOUS 
APPROACH IS TESTIMONY OF PROFESSIONALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The outbreaks of tuberculosis at La Quinta High School in Westminster, while 
closely monitored at the county level in recent months, continue to be a source 
of concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, 18 more students and two staff members at the school tested 
positive for TB bacteria after coming in contact with a student who in February 
suffered a relapse of contagious TB, even though she says she was taking her 
daily medication. The new cases came in addition to the almost 200 students and 
staff members who already were being treated; 17 of these were being treated 
for active TB and 175 others tested positive for exposure to the bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to these developments, it is heartening to see the seriousness 
with which county and state health officials are treating these cases. This is 
especially so in view of the disruption and anxiety necessarily being 
experienced by students at La Quinta. The fact that the school's administration 
has reported that many students are taking the latest TB threat in stride is 
testimony to the good spirits of people on campus. But it also is an indication 
of the measured professionalism with which county and state authorities are 
approaching the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has begun retesting most of the school's 1,300 students and staff 
as it had last fall. And the chief of the state's division of communicable 
disease control, Dr. Richard Jackson, has sent a physician with expertise in 
epidemiology, and a public health adviser, to review the case of the senior who 
suffered the relapse. The state has positioned itself to act as a consultant to 
the County Health Care Agency, which has the lead responsibility for dealing 
with the outbreak.  
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the state, the county agency already has decided to devote a 
physician full-time to coordinate the TB control effort at La Quinta. This 
includes not only doing the screening, but tracking students who are found to 
have latent or active TB, especially those who are members of the senior class 
and may be moving elsewhere or entering the work force after graduation.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the state has indicated that it intends to investigate the earlier 
outbreak at La Quinta, to see if there were any instances where cases were 
improperly diagnosed and reported and whether the patients' treatment had been 
properly monitored.  
</P>
<P>
 In view of the seriousness of the illness, these measures are warranted, and 
it is good to see the county and state cooperating in this important effort.

NEEDS OF MAJORITY OUTWEIGH NEEDS OF ONE DISRUPTIVE STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After reading "O.C. District Sues to Remove Child From Classroom" (May 26), 
it's easy to see why California's schools are so beleaguered. Here is a violent 
child, biting, hitting and disrupting other students, the teacher and several 
aides in a kindergarten classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the school district is powerless to place him in a special-education 
class, where there is a smaller class size and the teacher is specially trained 
to deal with his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, his (parent has) forced the school to place him in a regular class, 
thus disrupting the education of 30 (or so) other students. The parents of 
those students have a right to be outraged, but they need to direct their anger 
at those responsible for this travesty. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been a teacher for 20 years, and I've watched as special education, 
bolstered by federal and state laws, has encroached further and further on the 
scarce funds allotted to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 These laws have not been funded adequately, so every "victory" for special 
education in the form of more rights, more aides, more programs and more 
private placement results in less money for the regular kids. The obvious 
result is larger class sizes, fewer materials and supplies, and fewer programs 
for the vast majority of students. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, several questions need to be considered: 
</P>
<P>
 After a team of educational specialists has determined the best placement for 
a disabled child, should the parents have absolute veto power over their 
recommendation? 
</P>
<P>
 Should the public schools have to deal with violent, unmanageable children in 
a regular classroom setting? 
</P>
<P>
 How are tax dollars best spent in education? Should we spend up to $50,000 on 
a single disadvantaged child to help him realize his full potential, or should 
we be trying to maximize the educational possibilities for the vast majority of 
students? 
</P>
<P>
 Parents need to stand up to the increasingly absurd demands of the 
special-education lobby. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * It's time for the parents of regular-education children to speak up and 
protect their children's rights. These children are being denied their 
constitutional rights to a proper education. 
</P>
<P>
 When special-education students are mainstreamed into regular-education 
classrooms of over 30 students, one teacher and usually no aide, it is almost 
impossible for learning to go on without constant disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional and behavioral problems of these students demand all of the 
teacher's attention. The other students do without, and their education 
suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Special-education classes were developed to deal with the special needs of 
these children -- very small classes with more than one aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless a student demonstrates that he or she is not disruptive to the learning 
environment of all the children in the class, he or she should be kept in 
special-education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should the majority suffer because a few are heard all the time? 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, speak up for your children, protect their rights.

 * Re: federal Judge Matthew Byrne's decision to allow disruptive pupil, Jimmy 
Peters, to return to class and continue to disrupt same and cause parents to 
remove their children from class: I'm not unhappy with this move. Judge Byrne 
by his decision has succeeded in driving one more nail into the coffin of 
public education in California and more reason for "vouchers." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal judiciary has a long history of infringement on states' rights by 
mandating all forms of oppressive rulings concerning prisons, environment, 
illegal immigrants education, etc. with no thought to what effect these will 
have on the citizens or their pocketbooks or their safety from violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The other interesting facet to this case is the determination of Mr. Peters to 
thrust upon the rest of the classroom his disruptive and undisciplined child, 
despite the fact the child had available a personal tutor and two child 
psychologists to help -- at taxpayer expense. He just didn't give a tinker's 
damn about the others students.

STATEMENT IN MORGAN CASE INDEFENSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times quoted Orange County Deputy Defender Stephen J. Biskar (saying) 
that he is concerned that the media and public interest will jeopardize his 
client's ability to receive a fair trial ("Sex Attack Revealed in Morgan Case," 
May 26). 
</P>
<P>
 Biskar said, "This media storm reminds me of the Romans cheering as the lions 
are eating the Christians."The murder suspect and four-time rapist Edward 
Patrick Morgan Jr. is definitely not a "Christian." And we, the good and 
law-abiding people, are by no means "lions." 
</P>
<P>
 I hope Mr. Biskar will please get real. To be lenient to criminals is to be 
cruel to ourselves and our loved ones. To let a criminal have a second "strike" 
is to allow one more victim to be brutalized.

 * The statement of Deputy Public Defender Stephen J. Biskar, who represents 
accused rapist/murderer Edward P. Morgan Jr., that "this media storm reminds me 
of the Romans cheering as the lions are eating the Christians," is like so many 
statements made by the attorneys these days -- 100% upside down. The so-called 
"storm" he hears comes from the oppressed (the "Christians" cheering as the 
lions turn on the oppressors, the "Romans").

TAGGER-PADDLING BILL DECRIED AS NO CRIME DETERRENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding Assemblyman Mickey Conroy's bill to legalize public paddling of 
juvenile's convicted of graffiti offenses: Conroy (R-Orange) must be very naive 
if he believes this would have any deterrent effect. 
</P>
<P>
 I have worked for 30 years in public education, both in education of the 
gifted and dropout-prevention programs. It is clear that corporal punishment 
(particularly over the age of 5 years) serves only to teach children that 
physical aggression is an acceptable way to resolve problems. Brutality begets 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 Interview the outcasts of society and you will find the vast majority have 
been beaten in childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The perpetrators of graffiti are largely gang members or "wanna-bes." In order 
to join a gang, kids have to be "jumped" in. This is a brutal beating by the 
gang and is worn as a badge of honor by the new member. 
</P>
<P>
 A paddling in court would not approach the violence they have already 
experienced from the gang, and oftentimes from a brutal family situation. 
</P>
<P>
 They might in fact wear this as an additional honor to prove how "big" they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 Assigning them to work crews to clean up graffiti is much more appropriate and 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of building 14 new prisons in California over the next few years, why 
not take the money earmarked for one of these and apply it to one of the 
effective gang prevention programs that will bring these kids into the 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not live in a "Father Knows Best" world. They don't have role models. 
They need to be helped into productive citizenship, not beaten and humiliated. 
They get enough of that already. 
</P>
<P>
 EILEEN LILLY 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Mickey Conroy has introduced a bill requiring juvenile graffiti 
vandals to be paddled in court by their parents. The judge would decide if the 
smacks were hard enough to satisfy the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy has received national attention for his proposal, and other politicians 
are now following his lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mickey, here is a much better idea. Men found guilty of beating their 
wives would appear in court where they would be paddled by their parents and 
grandparents who taught them the value of violence. And Mickey, we would do 
this live on national TV with you in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to break the cycle of violence in our country, not promote it. 
Juveniles do graffiti along with their older adult friends who taught them how. 
</P>
<P>
 One strike and you are out rather than probation is needed. Work crews of 
offenders removing graffiti, along with group sessions involving parents, would 
be appropriate and effective.

DEVELOPMENT HAZARDS TO BOLSA CHICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was disturbed, but not surprised, to read about red foxes and kestrels 
preying on the least terns at Bolsa Chica ("Fox In The Tern House," June 3). As 
a graduate student in biology at Cal State Long Beach in the 1980s, I assisted 
in monitoring the least tern colonies along our coast. Kestrels, red foxes and 
domestic cats all prey on least terns. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan by the Koll Real Estate Group to build almost 5,000 homes at Bolsa 
Chica is approved, the predation problems will only get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, kestrels can also find prey on the undeveloped Bolsa Chica mesa. 
However, if the mesa is covered by houses and condominiums, the kestrels and 
other hawks which currently forage on the mesa will find the least tern chicks 
more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic cats brought in by the residents will also cause big problems for all 
of the ground-nesting birds at Bolsa Chica -- not just the least terns. 
</P>
<P>
 While I was monitoring a colony of terns at Terminal Island, one cat killed 
six adult least terns in two nights. Of course, when the adults are killed the 
chicks then die of starvation, if they are not first killed by cats or other 
predators. 
</P>
<P>
 The mesas are an important part of the ecosystem at Bolsa Chica. I doubt that 
the wetlands will continue to function and support the diversity of life that 
currently exists if the Bolsa Chica mesa is destroyed by development. 
</P>
<P>
 CONNIE BOARDMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial ("Bolsa Chica Plan Must Strive for Balance" May 15) suggests 
pragmatic negotiations between the Koll Construction Co. and those who would 
protect the Bolsa Chica from development as a solution to the problem of 
wetlands versus development. We, the protectors of the wetlands, see a swap of 
thousands of acres of public or formerly military-owned lands for 1,700 acres 
of irreplaceable wetlands and buffer zones to keep the endangered-species 
habitats safe, as just such a pragmatic land swap. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Orange County and Southern California need more affordable 
housing -- not waterfront, gated mansions or exclusive communities. We should 
not have to give up recreational, open-space land to make millionaires into 
billionaires.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON HEALTH CARE; BY DYING ON HIS OWN TERMS, 
NIXON LEAVES ANOTHER LEGACY ; THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S REFUSAL OF ARTIFICIAL LIFE 
SUPPORT POINTS TO PRIMACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVYN L. STERLING, Melvyn L. Sterling, M.D., is president of the Orange 
County Medical Assn. and chairs its Evolving Trends in Society Affecting Life 
Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In death as in life, we can learn from former President Richard M. Nixon. His 
refusing artificial life support has fueled the debate over medical care for 
the terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's advance directive was a deeply personal, appropriately selfish act, an 
acknowledgment that, at a time when critical medical decisions must be made, 
our loved ones may be emotionally overwhelmed and unable to provide appropriate 
guidance to the physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians, too, may have difficulty "letting go" of a patient they have cared 
for for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern medicine has created public expectations of positive outcomes -- only 
positive outcomes. Repeated polling shows broad public support for 
physician-assisted dying (suicide raises other issues not covered here). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite a federal law requiring patients be informed of their right to 
refuse end-of-life treatments, few exercise this crucial basic right to make 
their own final decisions by signing a simple document, the Durable Power of 
Attorney for Health Care. The form was developed by the California Medical 
Assn. and can be filled out by anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Making such determinations is the most private of decisions and underscores 
the essence of the physician-patient relationship. It becomes the bridge 
between life and death when the patient is unable to express his or her own 
desires. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients and physicians must reach a consensus soon and define reasonable and 
flexible guidelines for the care of those who have not already expressed their 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 If we do not, those riding the crest of the health care cost-containment wave 
may make the decision for us. 
</P>
<P>
 From my perspective, I was trained to cure, not retreat from attacking 
illnesses such as cancer, AIDS, heart disease, Alzheimer's and sudden violence. 
It can literally be a fight to the death and my reflex is to attack disease 
aggressively unless it is clear my patient wants otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 As a physician, it is very difficult to not do what I was trained to do. Also, 
many patients with a strong desire to live survive far beyond the medical norm. 
But in my training, I learned the foremost dictum of medicine -- primum non 
nocere -- first, do no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 As a general internist with many older patients and as a hospice medical 
director, I have dealt extensively with these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite clear patient directives to their family and to me, I have revisited 
the entire process with aggrieved spouses or children still unwilling to let 
their loved one go, acting as referee in a very emotional family debate. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases where no directive was given, how far can a physician go in 
advocating for the silent patient who previously confided their wishes to their 
physician? 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, most Americans support "ending life" when artificial life support 
will only delay death -- but not with their loved one. Physicians and families 
should ask "are we providing these treatments for the patient or for 
ourselves?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's dying should compel us all to make our choices before the grief and 
trauma of our condition puts our families and physicians in doubt, or worse, in 
conflict. After all, choosing how we want to die is exercising the same 
responsibility we take in daily living. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other parts of this decision-making process, including psychological 
and spiritual care and unfortunately, fear of hindsight. Physicians and 
health-care facilities still fear lawsuits by family members opposing the 
patient's expressed wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients, physicians and other impacted providers must join this debate in 
earnest. The advance directive is perhaps the most personal and individual of 
decisions. Family concerns matter, but the individual should make the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the focus has already begun shifting toward palliative care, the 
relief of pain and suffering. The end-of-life debate also has raised 
government's consciousness, with the issuance of new federal pain management 
guidelines. The health care marketplace is evolving, supporting more 
appropriate vehicles for end-of-life care. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, hospice care gives the terminally ill their right of 
self-determination and is a cost-effective alternative for such care. Almost 
all patients prefer to spend their final days at home, rather than in a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The pejorative term "futile care" may suggest health care rationing but what 
it really means is care that does not work. The development of scientifically 
valid, uniform standards and protocols would help us all. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients and their families could, with the aid of their physicians, make 
rational decisions regarding care at the end of life. The serious ethical and 
moral issues that arise when advances in medical technology conflict with a 
patient's stated desire to refuse such care could be addressed in a more 
rational context. A bill to help address this issue is currently pending in our 
state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Until we come to a consensus on end-of-life treatment and care, we should 
promote the primacy of the individual decision made by President Nixon and 
involve the public in this debate. 
</P>
<P>
 If we address these issues now, the next generation of Americans and their 
physicians will be better able to come to terms with saying farewell to our 
loved ones.

INSPIRING PROFILES OF VALEDICTORIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * At last! Good news in the local paper. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm referring, of course, to the eight wonderful profiles of Valley 
valedictorians, which appeared on May 31.The stories were compelling and 
inspiring, each in its own way, and captured the essence of the American Dream. 
From Addis Ababa to Sylmar, from Ahmedabad to Canoga Park, from Nha Tran to 
Granada Hills, from Zacatecas to Verdugo Hills, these young people drawing 
support from their families, overcame obstacles and settled for nothing less 
than the best. 
</P>
<P>
 As we each wrestle with the pressure of an increasingly diverse population, 
let the remarkable achievements of these Valley youngsters remind us of the 
generations of immigrants who came to this country, determined to succeed and 
who did. Thanks, L.A. Times, for letting us share in their accomplishments.

SECRECY, OUTRAGE CLOUD TRUE NATURE OF CLAS; MISSTEPS BY AGENCY MAR PUBLIC 
PERCEPTION OF TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One thing is certain involving the rigorous and controversial state 
educational testing program known as the California Learning Assessment System, 
or CLAS. If a public relations firm had been hired to sell the thing to the 
public and to handle the damage control to date, it would be out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 That is indeed a shame, because California employers, educators and parents 
deserve to know that students here are being tested by an exam that measures 
critical thinking skills. They need a test that determines whether our students 
are prepared to compete in the global marketplace. They need a 
performance-based test, not another one that stresses rote memorization, 
multiple choice "guesstimation," and grading on a curve. That was what CLAS was 
meant to be, and it can be that, with only a bit of fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there was first an uproar over whether the expensive exam was 
scored so sloppily as to have made it impossible to determine how well schools 
did on the test in comparison to other schools. Next to spin out of control 
were rumors about the test's content. Before long, questions that were never on 
the exam were being circulated as examples of why the test had to be scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education became as secretive as the Catholic Church's 
College of Cardinals is when a new Pope is elected. By the time that it finally 
agreed that individual students could opt out of the test, opponents of the 
testing already had left that barn door far behind. Several school systems, 
including the Antelope Valley Union High School District and Acton-Agua Dulce 
Unified, balked and refused outright to administer the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The state took the Antelope Valley district to court over the matter, and it 
has won the first round. We hoped it would be the only round. Superior Court 
Judge Diane Wayne has ruled that state law requires school districts to 
administer the CLAS test. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the district's school board has decided to appeal Judge Wayne's 
ruling. That was a mistake, and it might be a costly one in terms of 
unnecessary legal fees. The much maligned CLAS test is deserving of a second 
chance, and not a burial. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS test's future is already in doubt, with Gov. Pete Wilson's deletion 
from the budget, last month, of the money that had been designated for CLAS 
pending an overhaul of the test. Wilson's move was unnecessary and unduly 
damaging. 
</P>
<P>
 We have supported the bill sponsored by state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa 
Barbara) that would prohibit questions on the test that relate to students' or 
parents' personal beliefs about family life, sex, morality or religion. In 
effect, that would be a restatement of the state Education Code. Hart also 
wanted an independent panel review, and the release of previous versions of the 
exam to the public. Hart's bill narrowly passed the Senate on June 2 and faces 
an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Union High School District, Acton-Agua Dulce Unified, and 
the four other districts that have refused to administer the test should await 
the outcome of the Legislature's efforts to improve the CLAS test. Protracted 
and certain to be expensive legal battles are hardly a proper use of school 
system funds at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley Union High School Board President Bill Pricer had made the 
original motion to simply not administer the CLAS test. . . against the advice 
of the district's legal counsel. Bill Olenick was one of two Antelope Valley 
members to vote against Pricer's motion. Olenick argued that the district 
should give the test and leave it up to the parents to decide on whether their 
children would take it. Sometimes, the most simple solutions are the best. The 
board should reconsider Olenick's position and support it. His thoughts 
represent the most sensible course for the board to take.

AN INVESTMENT THAT'S MAKING THE GRADE; CORPORATE SCHOOL 'ADOPTIONS' PROVE 
VALUABLE, AS HIGHLIGHTED IN TALE OF TWO CAMPUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando High School and Roscoe Elementary School are similar in some 
respects. Both are in the east San Fernando Valley, have large Latino 
populations and many students with limited English skills. Each has parents 
who, struggling to make ends meet, can offer little help to their children's 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the difference we wish to highlight involves the presence of sustained 
outside support, or the lack thereof. A number of schools, for instance, have 
been adopted, in a manner of speaking, by businesses or groups or wealthy 
individuals. Yet many others, such as Roscoe Elementary in Sun Valley, are 
still orphans. Recent events at both describe the situation well. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, San Fernando High enjoyed the generous support of ARA 
Services/ARATEX SERVICES Inc. of Burbank. The firm supplied thousands of 
dollars worth of support annually in scholarships, field trips and the like. 
But hard financial times are forcing ARA to greatly reduce its connection with 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, San Fernando High already has Litton Guidance and Control Systems 
of Woodland Hills to take up the slack. On a recent night, for example, Litton 
representatives were passing out $500 college scholarships to San Fernando High 
students Filemon Rodriguez, 18; Jesus Torres, 18, and Marie Elizabeth Kelly, 
17. The selection criteria for the scholarships came from Litton's Hispanic 
Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton's help is vital to these three ambitious, college-bound seniors, 
according to Harold B. Soo Hoo, college and scholarship adviser at San Fernando 
High. Rodriguez's annual family income, for example, is only about $5,300 a 
year. He hopes to obtain a mechanical engineering degree from Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton has also donated computers, software and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Roscoe Elementary is in another situation entirely. It has no formal adoption 
agreement with any entity. Worse yet, just days after San Fernando High 
students were enjoying more of Litton's attention, Roscoe was being decimated 
by burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, all of Roscoe's computers, television sets, facsimile machine 
and even its nurse's office wheelchair was stolen. The thieves also broke 
several windows and doors and further vandalized the school by smearing paint 
in several classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were devastated. Everyone was totally depressed," Roscoe Assistant 
Principal Sue Cherry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton's relationship with San Fernando demonstrates the value of school 
adoptions. Roscoe Elementary's plights shows that there are still schools that 
are in need of the same kind of help. If you are an official of a company that 
wants to help a local school, Roscoe Elementary would be a worthy choice.

THE WRITING ON THE WALL IS A WARNING; ATTACK ON GABRIEL GETTLESON ILLUSTRATES 
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GRAFFITI AND VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hopefully, you have not been so bludgeoned by subsequent accounts of heinous 
crime that you have forgotten the memorable story of Gabriel Gettleson. He's 
the Chatsworth High School teen-ager who was waiting outside the school last 
December when he was shot and critically wounded by a member of a "tagging 
crew." The 15-year-old Sylmar boy who shot Gettleson wanted his book bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was convicted of attempted murder last week by a San Fernando 
Valley juvenile court judge. The incident and the trial that followed present 
us with a hard fact that must be spread widely and repeatedly among youths who 
continue to be attracted to the expensive blight of graffiti vandalism. They 
must be reminded that some of the taggers they wish to emulate are really 
street terrorists in spray-paint guise. The case is another tool to be used in 
the effort to persuade youths to avoid this uniquely intrusive and obnoxious 
form of so-called self-expression. Judge Morton Rochman said as much in his 
ruling in the Gettleson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts in this case should dispel the myth and illusion that taggers are 
simply mischievous kids or misguided artists," the judge intoned. "They are, in 
fact, gang members not reluctant to use violence." 
</P>
<P>
 The attempted murder conviction involved special allegations of great bodily 
injury and the use of a gun. The youth was also found guilty of aggravated 
assault and attempted robbery and of two other counts of robbery. One of his 
tagging buddies was earlier found guilty of driving the getaway car. Another 
suspect in the case is being tried as an adult as an accomplice to the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, not all taggers are so violent, but the judge's point is well taken 
in this case. The Gettleson shooting completed a frightening crime spree in 
which the Sylmar boy and other youths in two cars were searching for rival 
tagger gangs that day. Having found none, they attacked innocent citizens. They 
were also suspected of robbing two other victims that December day before 
shooting Gettleson over his book bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Gettleson has recovered. He was shot three times and was hospitalized for 
nearly three weeks. His family has moved out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 If you know any youths with itchy spray-paint fingers, show them this story. 
It might shock them into a better awareness of the world they are entering. It 
just might change their minds.

NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO SIT ALONE IN TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Commentary article by Gerald and Myrna Silver "Car Pool Lanes Are 
Putting Us In Reverse" (June 5), leaves many questions unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 If high-occupancy-vehicle lanes won't reduce travel time, why do people with 
whom I work report that their commute times are 20 minutes less each way using 
the HOV lanes on the San Diego and San Bernardino freeways? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it true that cars going 50-60 m.p.h. pollute less than cars in 
bump-and-grind traffic conditions? 
</P>
<P>
 HOV lanes are an option, a choice for people who try to pollute less and make 
their own lives less stressful. Is this bad? 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Silver's worship of his relationship with his car is very funny. Nobody 
wants to ban solo driving. Nobody cares if Mr. Silver ever gets out of his 
vehicle again. 
</P>
<P>
 But to make statements like "solo driving . . . is the ideal sought after by 
every commuter squeezed into some sort of collectivized transportation anywhere 
in the world" is absurd. Can anyone picture commuters on Metrolink trains or 
express buses looking at the jammed freeways alongside, putting down their 
newspapers or waking from their naps and screaming, "Stop! I want to sit alone 
in traffic!"

CHURCH FORGOT THE INDIVIDUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Anyone caught in bureaucratic rule-making that dehumanizes the individual 
can identify with Jennifer Espinoza, who found herself expelled from a Catholic 
high school because she got married before she turned 18. ("High School Bride 
Battles Archdiocese," May 27). 
</P>
<P>
 She had to get married in a civil ceremony after the church refused to allow 
her a Catholic wedding because she was a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 The church that defends arbitrary rules without considering individual 
circumstances does not extend that moral standard to causes its own leaders 
embrace. The same church defends the presence of illegal aliens and argues for 
their right to government financial benefits. Apparently, breaking federal laws 
and committing fraud are acceptable to the church, while getting married is to 
be condemned. The obsession with strict adherence to rules ends where the 
individual's behavior matches church leaders' own political views.

ATTACKS ON CLAS TESTS; STUDENTS' PRIVACY RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The attacks on the California Learning Assessment System tests as violating 
students' privacy rights miss the point of both the CLAS tests themselves and 
the larger issue of what is "education." 
</P>
<P>
 I recently took an English proficiency exam as part of my graduate program in 
mathematics at Cal State Northridge.The exam consisted of composing an essay in 
response to a question not unlike those used in the CLAS test. I was asked to 
describe how I felt about some subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in the experience did I find this to be an invasion of privacy. In 
this instance I was carefully instructed that I would be graded strictly on how 
I wrote, not what I wrote. The subject was chosen so that no special knowledge 
was required to compose a response. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, college is filled with instances where students are asked to 
evaluate something (a poem, a novel, a film) on the basis of their own life 
experiences. The point of the exercise is to get them to think, not simply 
parrot back memorized facts.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe these same goals are at least in part driving the creation of the 
CLAS tests. The problems described in recent news stories appear to be more of 
procedure for administering the tests rather than the tests themselves. 
Students participating in the tests must be made to understand what the goal of 
the test is, and how they will be graded. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the CLAS tests have given one good indication of what is wrong in 
public schools. Inability to reason independently and express one's self is 
being sheltered under the guise of a misguided notion of privacy.

TREAT VETERANS AS IF THEY'RE NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The plan to turn the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Medical Center into a 
state-of-the-art ambulatory care center constitutes discrimination against 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 If one veteran is less ill than another, that veteran is welcome under this 
plan. The other veteran will also be examined, but an ambulance may have to be 
sent to the center to take him or her to another hospital. How long will this 
take? Time means life or death; extra miles mean life or death. This plan is 
not worth even one life. 
</P>
<P>
 America is No. 1 thanks to our veterans. They should be treated accordingly.

GOLF CLUB PROJECT MAY ENCOURAGE GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Panorama City, opposes a 355-acre Cosmo World 
Inc. project with an international golf club in Big Tununga Wash (Valley 
Commentary, May 29). 
</P>
<P>
 I disagree with Mr. Katz.Being a 30-year native of the Sunland/Hansen Dam 
area, I have witnessed the plight of the dam and the wash. The Hansen Dam area 
was once nice for a Sunday outing, with family picnics, water skiing, swimming 
and fishing. It has since been reduced to a mudhole with the annoying roar and 
dust of the constant excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Katz refers to developers who care little about natural beauty. To 
him, natural beauty must mean weeds, broken fences, abandoned cars and 
appliances, along with the use of the roadside as a public dump. 
</P>
<P>
 With a project of this magnitude, I see nothing but growth and prosperity for 
the Sunland area, growth that complements and enhances its equestrian 
lifestyle.

 Ever since the Rodney King incident, police officers are being forced to "lay 
back," and they cannot possibly effectively perform their duties for fear of 
being charged with abuse and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the men and women on the police force are forthright and 
dedicated public servants who have families to raise and must risk their lives 
to earn a living. Yet, I wholeheartedly agree with Gideon Kanner's letter to 
the editor (May 8). I cannot see how forcing a doughnut shop to reduce its 
hours of operation or to hire security can serve any purpose except to force 
these businesses out of business or out of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens, legitimate businesses and security guards cannot and must not be 
expected to take on the role of the police. The only effective way to stop the 
crime epidemic is for the police to get out there and properly do their job 
without fear of being charged with discrimination, abuse and fabricated 
multimillion dollar lawsuits.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; LET'S TEACH FUTURE TEACHERS THE RIGHT WAY; THE LEGISLATURE 
HAS PRESCRIBED A LITANY OF SUBJECTS AS PART OF THE ONE-YEAR PROGRAM FOR 
PROSPECTIVE EDUCATORS. BUT THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT CAN BE TAUGHT IN 30 UNITS. 
THERE IS SOME HOPE FOR CHANGE.

<P>
 Who can give CPR to a heart attack victim, settle violent disputes, help 
parents rear brighter kids, understand how language works and bring young minds 
along the road to maturity? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: a California public school teacher! During their one-year 
education program, prospective teachers must get instruction in each of these 
subjects and a litany of others prescribed by the state's Legislature and 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these requirements are born of good intentions and stem from genuine 
concerns about school quality. The Legislature mandates a new area of 
instruction for the teacher-education curriculum when it perceives a social 
problem and decides that teachers ought to be society's first line of action 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, some students come to school armed with guns. This resulted in a 
bill to compel prospective teachers to receive instruction in "disarming 
students." Eventually that was changed to "resolving conflicts." This change 
relieved us of the sight of hand-to-hand combat lessons in schools of 
education, but the underlying goal remained the same, and a new straw was added 
to the camel's back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The current design for teacher education in California was established in the 
Ryan Act adopted more than 20 years ago. It resulted in making teacher 
preparation a one-year, post-baccalaureate endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, teachers-to-be cannot study education as undergraduates. They 
major in an academic subject if they intend to teach secondary school and take 
a slightly different course of study if they want to go into elementary 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-baccalaureate teaching credential program seeks to "make a teacher" 
in only two semesters or about 30 units of study, including student teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is encumbered by the continual injection of newly legislated 
topics of study. Some of these topics merit study by new teachers. But how 
meaningful can that study be when it is crammed into such a limited amount of 
time? 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative micro-managing of teacher education is nothing new, but confronted 
with today's social and economic problems, the Legislature has increasingly 
intruded into the curriculum. Recently adopted and proposed topics include 
working with parents in partnerships, self-esteem and violence. A bill 
mandating instruction in gender equity issues is pending. One on anabolic 
steroids, mercifully, failed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, despite our limitless hopes and expectations for new teachers, 
there is a limit to what can be taught in 30 units. The underlying problem 
exists within the program designed by the Ryan Act itself. We simply cannot 
expect this rigid and restrictive model to produce the teachers we need today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, at the same time that policy makers have engaged in creative 
over-regulation of university teacher education, some are now interested in 
"alternative teacher certification" programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alternative certification" is often a euphemism for programs that substitute 
an apprenticeship for legislatively imposed requirements, even good ones, and 
the university credential programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of such programs exist now. One is in Los Angeles, where a law 
allows the district to certify teachers hired in shortage areas. Some current 
bills would throw away the few rules that do apply to these programs. For 
instance, one would allow teacher education to be carried out by 
entrepreneurial entities, no matter how unqualified their personnel may be. 
</P>
<P>
 In our view, the teacher-education curriculum should be the province of those 
who have made a career of understanding it from a broad, societal point of 
view. It is the teacher education community, including universities and school 
districts, that must attract able students and prepare them to teach 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature should demand accountability for high-quality programs but 
should neither engage in patchwork curriculum-writing nor give a free hand to 
any group that wants to prepare teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there is the hope of change. A new law requires the state 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing to examine the whole question. We hope it 
recognizes that preparing teachers can and should take many forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people can become good teachers through short, intensive course work and 
on-the-job practice. Others may learn better through an extended program over 
time, starting as assistant teachers. Still others will benefit from immersion 
in professional development schools modeled on teaching hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced ex-teacher aides who understand the community need specialized, 
career-ladder credential programs. Experts in math and science from aerospace 
businesses need to learn about child and adolescent development and pedagogy. 
And why shouldn't some undergraduates study their disciplines and 
simultaneously study how to teach them? Teacher education institutions and 
programs must become more different, not more alike. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California State University would make an excellent laboratory, in partnership 
with the schools, for the reinvention of teacher education. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of its campuses could continue to prepare teachers under the current 
California model. At the other 10, the Legislature could waive all credential 
and program requirements for five years. They would be expected to redefine 
expectations and redesign teacher education programs to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's try it, and then compare and learn from the outcome.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; CLAS TEST RECEIVING A BAD RAP; IT'S SIMPLY ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THE CLASSROOM AND PREPARING KIDS TO MEET TOMORROW'S CHALLENGES. AND 
THAT'S ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's been an education witch hunt going on, with the California Learning 
Assessment System cast as the witch. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS, the new statewide student achievement test, does not deserve the 
mistreatment. Notwithstanding what Gary Kreep and the United States Justice 
Foundation say, it isn't a subversive attempt to delve into your child's 
psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, despite extensive press coverage, are the first year's scores invalid 
because only a handful of tests were scored. And it shouldn't be canceled 
because of late delivery, nor dropped because it cost $24 million. It's not 
about raising or lowering property values. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS isn't a whim. It didn't appear overnight. Years of debate preceded its 
adoption. First we had to abandon the multiple-guess testing most of us grew up 
with. Memorizing minutia and disconnected factoids might win championships on 
"Jeopardy," but multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank skills aren't the ones our 
graduates need. People need to solve problems they have never seen before, make 
connections from various sources and communicate their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS was designed to assess students' higher-order thinking and guide 
teachers. It's about what happens in the classroom. It's about preparing kids 
to meet the challenges they will face when they leave school. That's all, 
folks! 
</P>
<P>
 A test section might call for students to make a connection between what 
motivates a character in a story and what motivates them. CLAS, to a small 
degree, asks students to examine their lives at whatever level they are able. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are not encouraged to reveal family secrets. They have lives in the 
classroom, experiences with teachers and one another and thoughts of their own 
upon which they can reflect. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests require students, working in groups, to predict what they think 
might happen given a set of conditions, just as they might someday need to 
predict the outcome of a business decision before committing themselves to an 
action. In the language arts test, students must try to think like a character 
from a reading selection and then adopt an opposing point of view. A valuable 
skill? Of course! In the workplace one is frequently challenged to put one's 
self into the mind of a customer, a co-worker, even the boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Because answers aren't absolute, the tests have to be scored one at a time, by 
people, not Scantron machines. I never thought all the tests would be scored, 
and it doesn't matter that they're not. Teachers will teach to the test as long 
as any are scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tests will make teachers adjust the way they deliver information, and 
some are none too happy about it. It is challenging to prepare a student for a 
math question like the following: "A visitor from outer space has just arrived. 
It is confused about our number system. It asks you, 'Is 5 + 29 equal to 529?' 
Answer the visitor's question and explain your answer." Math teachers will have 
to move away from repetitious number drills into a deeper examination of how we 
identify a problem and then solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests identify areas for improvement, and 1993 was only the first year. We 
have just completed giving the second round of tests. We hope to gain not 
another tool to determine where to buy a house but a better understanding of 
how students reason and how we educators can help them. 
</P>
<P>
 As schools, students and educators adjust to the new test, scores will 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that in a few years we will be able to assess CLAS by the only 
criterion which really counts: Does it improve education? Until that time, 
forget the witch hunt and let's get on with educating our students.

STATE TAKING WRONG ROAD IN DRIVE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES; POLLUTION STILL WILL BE 
EMITTED BY POWER PLANTS. HYDROGEN IS THE WAY TO GO, AND THE VALLEY CAN BE A KEY 
PLAYER IN THE TECHNOLOGY'S DEVELOPMENT.

 Don't look now, but there is a ZEV in your future. Or maybe a LEV or a ULEV. 
</P>
<P>
 No, we're not talking about a mustachioed politician, his twin brother and a 
distant cousin. The ZEV, LEV and ULEV affecting all San Fernando Valley 
residents by 1998 are zero, low and ultra-low emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Air Resources Board is weighing options presented by auto 
makers to meet toughening air quality standards. Electric vehicles firmly 
occupy the inside track in this race for big dollars, since the ARB recognizes 
these as zero-emission vehicles, totally pollution-free. In May, the board 
upheld a requirement that the auto industry sell electric cars in California by 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to quibble, but this doesn't make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The air following an electric vehicle may smell as sweet as a newly bathed 
baby, but somewhere someone else is suffering with air that makes a diaper 
pail's aura pleasant by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, those happy little electrons that are just dying to propel your 1999 
Electrivette down Interstate 405 need a little convincing before they are ready 
to serve you. True, billions of them are available in the wire hooked up to 
recharge your waiting E'vette, but they need a push before loading up its 
tired-out battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushers in our society suffer from bad press. These electric pushers, or power 
generating plants, are no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coal-fired plants generate about half of the U.S. electric power. Even with 
expensive pollution-control devices, the sulfur in the coal returns to earth as 
acid rain, devastating plants and wildlife. Moreover, coal combustion generates 
vast quantities of that greenhouse ogre -- carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
 Petroleum and natural-gas power plants produce another 20% of our electricity. 
These natural resources are limited, and imported petroleum contributes to our 
balance of payments problems. And the carbon dioxide produced by combustion 
adds to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuclear power contributes about 15% to satisfying our electrical appetite. 
Talk about bad press. To point out the problems with this power source would be 
to flog a mortally wounded horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the possible methods of recharging an electrically mobile 
society, 10% of our power is generated hydroelectrically. The rest comes from a 
handful of environmentally benign technologies including geothermal, wind, 
solar thermal and solar photovoltaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Electric cars masquerading as socially responsible ZEVs, LEVs and ULEVs? No 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 But envision our society propelled happily down the freeway of life without 
asphyxiation, with no melting of polar icecaps, preserving the rainbow trout 
and, at the same time, thumbing our collective noses at the petty tyrants who 
always seem to control the world's oil supply. Pipe dream? Think again. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember how in the '60s Dustin Hoffman was urged to ponder the word plastics 
? For '90s graduates, the word is hydrogen.  
</P>
<P>
 Burn hydrogen in an auto engine, as Mazda's road tests are now demonstrating, 
and all you get are water and a trace of nitrogen oxides, a tiny fraction of 
the nitrogen oxides now created by gasoline-burning engines. Take it a 
technological step further and combine hydrogen with oxygen from air in a 
device called a fuel cell and you generate enough electric power on board to 
propel a bus. Euro-Quebec Hydro-Hydrogen Pilot Project demonstration buses will 
travel the streets soon. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds too good to be true: renewable energy based on the most abundant 
element in the universe. The combustion product falls back to earth as 
life-giving rain. What's the catch? 
</P>
<P>
 The catch, my friends, is money. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming technical problems is expensive. One challenge is developing a safe 
gas tank. Developing hydrogen into a viable, large-scale energy resource will 
take big bucks. This explains why the Japanese have established the World 
Energy Network, a hydrogen-development plan with a reported budget of more than 
$2 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And where do we stand? The Department of Energy, which is responsible for 
maintaining U.S. preeminence in energy, submitted a 1995 request for $5.5 
million for hydrogen research, down from the 1994 budget of $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Have we given up on trying to compete in this emerging global technology even 
before it gets off the ground? Are future Miatas going to drain our dollars not 
only when they're bought but throughout their 10- to 15-year lifetimes? 
</P>
<P>
 Our Valley is a key battleground in this ZEV shootout. From Calstart, the 
nonprofit Burbank-based company chartered to develop advanced transportation 
technology, to the federal Energy Technology Engineering Center in the 
mountains above Chatsworth, the Valley stands to gain economically from 
development of hydrogen for transportation. Valley-bred aerospace technologies 
in hydrogen, photovoltaics and fuel cells position us at the center of this 
transportation revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 If we invest in hydrogen development, the Hydrogen Valley teamed with Silicon 
Valley will reign as California's technology crown jewels in the 21st Century.

CENTERS OF ATTENTION; FOR THE KNICKS THERE'S EWING, FOR THE ROCKETS THERE'S 
OLAJUWON; OTHER MATES ARE DISTANT SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Their recipe for success seems borrowed from a distant age, when winning a 
National Basketball Assn. title without leaning heavily on your center was as 
tricky as making an omlette without eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Knicks and Houston Rockets are chasing this year's championship 
with an old-school formula. The big man, once again, is a big factor. For a 
while, he watched impatiently while the league turned into a trendy smaller 
man's game. Leapers and three-point shooters and no-look passers reaped the 
NBA's ultimate reward while post play became secondary and post players became 
complimentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, either the Knicks' Patrick Ewing or the Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon will 
claim a ring later this month. Both are, by far, the best on their teams. There 
is Ewing and there is Olajuwon, and on those squads, every other player falls 
in line a distant second. There hasn't been anything like this in a while. In 
fact, 16 years have passed since a center-dominated team won the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake -- several great centers have won titles in that span. But 
they all had something in common. They all had tremendous teammates. Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish were surrounded by Hall of Fame help. Moses 
Malone didn't win until he joined Julius Erving. Wes Unseld had the Big E. 
</P>
<P>
 You remove Ewing from the Knicks and Olajuwon from the Rockets, and you have 
the Sacramento Kings vs. the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is evident: The game has evolved once again. The revolution of the 
cycle is complete. A few eras ago, teams were only as good as their pivotmen. 
Nobody won championships without Russells or Chamberlains or Reeds or Waltons. 
Then came was a lengthy drought when guards and forwards -- basketball's 
equivalent to the welterweight division -- steered their teams to 
championships. Today, half of this year's serious championship contenders were 
center-oriented. And now, two have a chance to win a title. 
</P>
<P>
 This was destined to happen, once the Magic-Bird-Jordan years were officially 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "This history of basketball has always been marked by a big man leading his 
team," said Bill Walton, "with a 16-year exception." 
</P>
<P>
 Walton was the last of his kind, a center with tremendous responsibility on a 
championship team. He was complemented by worthy and capable role players on 
the 1976-77 Portland Trail Blazers. They performed their specialized duties 
well enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was blessed with teammates who could catch my bad passes," Walton says 
modestly. 
</P>
<P>
 But, truth is, everything hinged on the performance of Walton. He had to play 
superbly throughout the championship round in order for the Blazers to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted him to touch the ball on every possession," said Jack Ramsay, who 
coached that Blazer team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blazers' entire offense was stamped with Walton's signature. The Blazers 
ran a constant motion offense, primarily because of Walton's passing skills, 
the best of any center before or since. He also had post-up and mid-range 
shooting ability, and was one of the better defenders of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blazers beat the Philadelphia 76ers in six games, claimed the title . . . 
and then the NBA developed a new identity for the next 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the skill positions began to dominate the scope. The impact of the 
center was lessened as the years passed. The Seattle SuperSonics won a 
championship based on backcourt play, with a clever point guard and a 
defensive-minded big guard. By the turn of the decade, Magic Johnson and Larry 
Bird suddenly were players that teams needed to win championships. 
</P>
<P>
 You may argue that, in his rookie season, Johnson wasn't the focus of the Los 
Angeles Lakers. Abdul-Jabbar was. However, the Lakers wouldn't have beaten the 
Sixers for the 1979-80 title if not for Johnson. Abdul-Jabbar, victimized by a 
severely sprained ankle, didn't even suit up for the deciding game. Johnson 
assumed the major role, and his legendary Game 6 line -- 42 points, 15 rebounds 
and seven assists -- lifted the Lakers to glory. The purists could only satisfy 
themselves with one thing about that game: At least Magic played center that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the '80s and the early '90s were noted for its complete blackout 
of the team-carrying center. The only center who came closest to fitting that 
description was Malone. On sheer determination, he single-handedly led the 
Houston Rockets to the 1981 finals, where they challenged the Boston Celtics. 
That's when Malone uttered his famous quote, about how he "and four guys from 
Petersburg, Virginia" could whip the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 He discovered that four Celtics and Bird were much better. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Malone's title chase proved futile until he linked himself with 
Erving and took the '83 trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the center's role on championship teams began to diminish, even on 
the great Celtic and Laker teams of the '80s. Bird was clearly the leader of 
the Celtics, and forward Kevin McHale was every bit as important as Parish. 
Abdul-Jabbar's impact decreased with age, to the point where he occasionally 
was the third option on the last two Laker championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Celtic-Laker era ended, the Detroit Pistons won two consecutive 
titles with the three-guard rotation of Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars and Vinnie 
Johnson, while center Bill Laimbeer was valued mainly for his intimidation and 
rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the center was removed almost entirely from the last three NBA Finals, 
all won by the Chicago Bulls and the game's greatest player, Michael Jordan. 
What's especially noticeable about that period is that the Bulls didn't even 
face a team with an outstanding center in any championship series. They beat 
the Lakers and Vlade Divac, the Blazers and Kevin Duckworth, the Phoenix Suns 
and Mark West. 
</P>
<P>
 "The centers weren't as good as the other players in that time period," Walton 
said. "You win the championship with the best players, and for the most part, 
they weren't centers. They were the Isiah Thomases, the Birds and the Johnsons. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had a period of time when so many of the big men who came into the league 
did so because they were big. They had to become good players." 
</P>
<P>
 The game changed, too. It progressed from a half-court, ram-it-inside style to 
an up-tempo, fast-break pace that required athletes. Not many centers were 
built for baseline-to-baseline sprinting. The introduction of the three-point 
shot also placed a heavier value on the smaller man. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, every position on the floor was important, not just the one 
in the middle. On some teams, the big man was the weak link. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really helped the smaller player was his shooting ability from the 
perimeter," Walton said. "The game back in the '60s was built around centers 
because they took the easiest shots. The shooting percentages of other players 
were low. Now, smaller guys have developed into great shooters. They began 
hitting the wide-open 20-footers, and you have to do that today or you're not 
in this league for long." 
</P>
<P>
 When the playoffs began a month ago, center-dominated teams littered the 
field. There was Shaquille O'Neal in Orlando, David Robinson in San Antonio and 
Dikembe Mutombo in Denver, along with Ewing and Olajuwon. With the exception of 
the first two, centers were the most visable and valuable players in the 
post-season. 
</P>
<P>
 The youthful Nuggets were successful mostly because of Mutombo. His defensive 
presence was immense throughout the playoffs. He snuffed the team with the 
NBA's best regular-season mark by rejecting a record 31 shots by the 
SuperSonics. Then he put a scare into the Utah Jazz by disrupting their 
half-court style with 38 blocks, breaking his own record in the process. 
Mutombo invoked the same style that Bill Russell used during the Celtics' run 
of championships in the '60s. He left the scoring to others while he 
concentrated on the elements that produced the end result -- blocking shots, 
grabbing rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns, last year's Western Conference champion, were simply Hakreemed. 
While Charles Barkley disintegrated from back and groin injuries, Olajuwon 
produced 37 points and 13 rebounds and dusted off Phoenix in Game 7 of their 
semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 As the same time, Ewing was busy helping the Knicks dispatch the Bulls, their 
nemesis of recent playoff years. With Jordan retired, Ewing was expected to 
push the Knicks past the Bulls, and that was accomplished after a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like it's finally my time," Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ewing nor Olajuwon is blessed with a great point guard, and that's the 
most astonishing factor in their ascent this season. Most centers, the good and 
not-so-good, usually require a decent point guard who can deliver the ball. The 
Rockets and Knicks have point guards by committee. Still, the lack of an 
outstanding point guard hasn't disrupted either center. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason lies with the perimeter shooting ability of both centers. When the 
lanes become clogged with the double- and triple-team defenses, both players 
can step outside and sink the 18-footer. Therefore, it's not necessary that 
they rely on a point guard on every ball possession. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other player, Ewing's championship chances were damaged by 
Jordan. Three times in the previous four seasons, Ewing and the Knicks were 
eliminated by the Bulls. All that changed with an October news conference in 
suburban Chicago. When Jordan muttered two magical words -- "I'm retired" -- 
Ewing's window of opportunity was pushed wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Jordan was still here, he'd carry the Bulls past New York and everyone 
else," said Pat Williams, the Orlando Magic president. "He would not let his 
team lose to the Knicks, and once he reached the finals, Jordan was as 
unstoppable as anyone. So I'd say, as much as anything else, Jordan's 
retirement will be responsible for a great center winning this year's 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets are completely built around Hakeem. The defensive attention he 
attracts makes it easier on his teammates. He allows Vernon Maxwell and Kenny 
Smith to get open three-point shots. He enables forward Otis Thorpe to roam 
inside for rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a chance to win an NBA championship before. But, like Ewing, he fell 
victim to one of the great non-centers of the '80s. Eight years ago, two Rocket 
centers -- Olajuwon and 7-foot-4 Ralph Sampson -- were not enough to overcome 
Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 What has helped Olajuwon is his resiliency. Rather than try to beat Bird and 
Magic Johnson in their prime, Olajuwon simply outlasted them. And he actually 
became a better player during the waiting period, sharpening such skills as 
passing and jump-shooting to become the best player in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "His game has developed over the years," Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. 
"It's amazing how far he's come. He was really pretty raw when he got to 
America (in 1980), but now he's got the power and the quickness. He can beat 
you with the finesse game, going outside. He can play big, strong guys in the 
middle or drift out on a guard and use his quickness. It's really a great story 
about how far he's come." 
</P>
<P>
 Not coincidently, Olajuwon became the first center to win the league's Most 
Valuable Player trophy since Malone in '82-83. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best center this game has seen in quite a while," Ramsay said. "He 
can do so many things to dominate a game. Olajuwon is incredible. You can't 
stop him. Teams will double him and he gets his shot off before the double 
comes. Or he's passing it out to wide-open teammates. Olajuwon always finds a 
way to beat you." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be only fitting for a dominant center to win this year's title. They 
have won everything else this season. Robinson claimed the scoring crown and 
became the first center to do so since Bob McAdoo nearly 20 years earlier. 
Robinson finished just ahead of O'Neal. And in the MVP race, four of the top 
five vote-getters were centers, with Olajuwon finishing ahead of Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend throughout the league this year was defense and half-court offense. 
Both aspects placed a heavier emphasis on center play. It's no surprise that 
the Knicks and Rockets excelled in the style that was favored by most teams 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game is really changing," said basketball TV analyst Doug Collins. 
"You're not seeing as many fast-breaks. You're seeing more possession 
basketball. The possibility of Patrick and Hakeem getting together is exciting. 
You're seeing the big man start to become a major part of things again. With 
Magic, Bird and Isiah gone, we've lost some of the most dominant creators on 
the perimeter in the last couple of years. Centers are taking their place."

MITCHELL HAS HELD INTEREST IN SPORTS FOR HALF A CENTURY; BASEBALL: MAINE 
SENATOR IS LEAVING POLITICS "TO CONSIDER OTHER CHALLENGES," PERHAPS AS 
COMMISSIONER OF THE NATIONAL PASTIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, probably is going to be the next commissioner 
of baseball, but no stain on his character -- or reservation about his 
suitability -- is intended in noting that his earliest sporting influence came 
from basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1940s, when Mitchell was a teen-ager, pro basketball had a slight 
toehold in Boston, and none at all in central Maine, where Mitchell grew up. 
But semipro basketball flourished. One of the best semipro players was John 
(Swisher) Mitchell, George's older brother, a small, deft ball-handling guard. 
Swisher, who starred at the University of Rhode Island, is said to be the only 
college player to hold Holy Cross' Bob Cousy to less than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In those postwar years Swisher organized semipro teams that barnstormed 
through Maine. The players, mostly former college players, including another 
Mitchell brother, Robbie, were paid $50 or $60 a game and a hotel room. The 
youngest member of the entourage, however, was paid almost nothing and forced 
to carry equipment. Once, when a car broke down near the Canadian border, he 
was sent home on a bus. George Mitchell, short and slow afoot, was considered 
more a manager than a player. He didn't mind that. But he minded one aspect of 
the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to stay in the homes of the local promoters," says Mitchell, 60, the 
memory galling more than 45 years later. "My brothers and the other players 
lodged at the hotels. I guess my brother figured he could save a few dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Money was indeed a factor, Swisher recalls. But so was seniority, as well as 
an incipient threat to young George's innocence. As Swisher tells it, Maine's 
small-town hotels were veritable dens of iniquity. 
</P>
<P>
 "George was low man on the Mitchell brothers totem poll," Swisher says. 
"Besides, my mother would have killed me if George had got corrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 Semipro basketball barnstorming may not have put much money in George 
Mitchell's pocket, and it did not gain him entry to the hotel rooms of his 
adolescent fantasy. But it enabled the future senator to get out of his 
hometown of Waterville and explore his vast home state. 
</P>
<P>
 "George always was outward looking, even then," Swisher says. 
</P>
<P>
 George Mitchell appears not to have changed much. This spring he announced he 
is leaving the Senate, at the end of his term, January 1995, "to consider other 
challenges." He also removed himself from the top of President Clinton's list 
to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun. The reason he gave is 
he wants to focus on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both decisions stunned the political world, but in George Mitchell's quiet way 
they made sense. As baseball commissioner, he will routinely barnstorm 28 major 
league cities. He won't have to carry equipment or be sent home if a car breaks 
down. He will lodge in the plushest suites in the most luxurious hotels and get 
the best seat in every ballpark. The teen-age boy inside of him should be 
fulfilled. At long last, he will be high man on a totem poll at the center of 
America's biggest and best party. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand why Mitchell might want to be baseball commissioner, you first 
must know that for millions of first-generation Americans, sports once was the 
transforming experience. In an earlier era, before multiculturalism became an 
end in itself, immigrant families strived to be American. When Americanism was 
in full flower, in Mitchell's youth, where did it exist more tangibly than at 
the heart of the national pastime? Who was more American than the commissioner 
of baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports have meant so much to this family," Swisher Mitchell says. "Sports 
lifted us up." 
</P>
<P>
 On a cloudy spring afternoon, Swisher Mitchell shows me the important places 
of his brother's youth. First, the old Lebanese neighborhood in Waterville, now 
a sloping green field and a parking lot between the Kennebec River and the 
Maine Central Railroad tracks. Here, Swisher says, their parents settled in the 
late 1920s. George Mitchell Sr., the orphaned son of Irish immigrants and 
adopted son of Lebanese immigrants, and Mary Saad, his Lebanese wife, had four 
boys and a girl. Paul, John, Robbie and George, the youngest boy, followed by 
their sister, Barbara. George Sr., who spoke fluent French and Arabic, held 
jobs as a laborer and janitor. Mary Saad, who never learned to read English, 
worked a graveyard shift in cloth mills. 
</P>
<P>
 When George was a small boy, they moved into a larger house on Front Street, 
on the other side of the tracks, closer to St. Joseph's Maronite Church, where 
George became an altar boy. During World War II, George and his friends sat on 
the Mitchells' front porch and waved to soldiers in the transport trains. The 
two-story frame house still stands, distinguished by its plainness and one 
curiously ornate leaded window. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away lived the town's dominant ethnic group, the French Canadians, and 
farther on was a Jewish neighborhood. Ethnic peace prevailed, usually, and many 
of the town's ethnic youth congregated at a Boys Club to play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up that street," Swisher Mitchell points, "was the way to the Boys Club. That 
was our second home." 
</P>
<P>
 Swisher, Robbie and Paul were crackerjack athletes. Swisher and Robbie played 
basketball at Rhode Island, Paul played baseball at the University of Maine in 
Orono. 
</P>
<P>
 George tried to match the athletic exploits of his gifted brothers, but he was 
smaller and slower. One of his childhood friends, Paul Maroon, remembers him 
dragging a bat and ball to the field. "If he didn't bring them, he couldn't 
play," Maroon says. Mitchell's father was sympathetic and advised him to make 
his mark with his brain. With his father's encouragement, George practiced 
oratory at home, reading aloud the Epistles and poetry. He easily mastered his 
studies and graduated from Waterville High a year ahead of his class. But he 
was not content to be just a bookworm. He became involved in school politics, 
made the basketball team as a reserve and played Junior Legion baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, George's mother, concerned about his slow physical development, 
served him goat's milk -- an Old World remedy -- without telling him. Something 
worked. George grew two inches in one year and reached 5-11 1/2, taller than 
his three brothers. By the time George entered Bowdoin College in 1950, he was 
tall and fast enough to make the basketball team. For four years, he worked a 
succession of jobs -- dorm proctor, fraternity steward, truck driver, night 
watchman, construction worker -- to pay tuition and bills. Yet he held his spot 
on the basketball team and started at guard his last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell went on to work his way through night law school at Georgetown 
University as an insurance claims adjustor. His earnings have been modest, and 
according to public record, he ranks in the bottom 5% of U.S. senators in 
personal wealth. The commissioner's salary of $1 million is not the decisive 
inducement, says his brother Robbie. But it is an important one. "He doesn't 
have a lot of money," Robbie says. "He's got houses to keep up in Portland and 
Washington, and he's always going back and forth. Contrary to what people 
think, money is a factor." 
</P>
<P>
 At the nation's Capitol, on a weekday afternoon in late May, reporters wait 
for Mitchell to emerge from a closed caucus of Democratic senators. Most of 
them will write stories on health-care reform -- the issue that is consuming 
most of Mitchell's final months in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 First reporter: "Will he answer questions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Second reporter: "Mitchell always answers questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Third reporter: "He stops and talks. There's a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell can be coy. Baseball owners, fans and media will have to get used to 
him. A profile in Congressional Quarterly's "Politics in America" describes him 
thusly: "As a lawyer, judge and a politician, Mitchell relates to interviews as 
debates and treats questions as three-dimensional traps. He often responds to 
questions not by answering them but by questioning their premises -- usually 
with a few words of courteous preface such as 'with all due respect.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Mitchell appears, reporters engulf him beneath oil portraits of a few 
unsmiling 19th-century senators, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, Charles Sumner 
and Daniel Webster. Mitchell has been a competent lawmaker, but his undramatic 
personal style is unlikely to stir historians or portrait artists. He is 
outwardly judicious, prim, soft-spoken, and wry, qualities that wear well and 
invite trust but are not charismatic or glamorous. Only once has Mitchell 
roused the public with emotion, and it was memorable. That came during the 1987 
Iran-Contra hearings, when he tired of Oliver North's self-righteous bombast. 
He cut off North with a stern admonishment, "Please remember that it is 
possible for an American to disagree with you on aid to the Contras and still 
love God and still love this country, just as much as you do. Although He is 
regularly asked to do so, God does not take sides in American politics." 
</P>
<P>
 The questions come hard and fast: When will the health-care bill in Finance be 
marked up? What will you discuss with the president tomorrow? Your reaction to 
Senator Breaux's plan to trigger employer mandates on health insurance? Are you 
disappointed in the pace of the health-care debate? The Republicans are talking 
about turning up the heat on Whitewater -- does that concern you? (Mitchell: "I 
get the heat turned up on me every day. I'd feel lost without it.") 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell fields the questions with varying degrees of factuality and evasion, 
in a calm, considered voice devoid of Maine's "Down East" inflection. After 
satisfying the print reporters, he repeats the process before a bank of TV 
cameras. Finally, all of the TV people have enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "More questions?" Mitchell asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you become baseball commissioner, will you bring major league baseball to 
Maine?" 
</P>
<P>
 For a long instant Mitchell gives me the twice over. Then, a wide grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good Double-A team in Portland this year," he says. "A Florida 
Marlins team. My friend, Dan Burke, runs it. I haven't had the opportunity to 
see them play yet. But I hope to do so soon." 
</P>
<P>
 I give Mitchell a chance to duck another question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you talk about becoming baseball commissioner?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's offered me anything," Mitchell says. "I haven't accepted anything. 
I'm getting a lot of proposals from other fields. Corporations, businesses, 
universities, law firms and others. My intention is to wait a period of time 
and see what interests me the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's office had warned me that the senator is not discussing baseball 
issues of substance: the antitrust exemption, expansion, collective bargaining, 
cable copyright law. That leaves softball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, would you talk about your connection to baseball?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a lifelong baseball fan. I played Junior Legion baseball through 
high school. I've been to Fenway Park hundreds of times. My three older 
brothers were great athletes. One of them, Paul, played baseball in college. I 
was a second baseman. My brother, John, says that I was a good fielder with a 
lousy arm who couldn't hit. I guess that means all I could do was pick up the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell chuckles. Over the years, he has endeared himself to Maine voters 
with self-deprecating tales of athletic ineptitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old Orchard Beach used to have a Triple-A team called the Maine Guides," he 
goes on. "It came from Charleston and now it's in Wilkes-Barre. Gary Thorne was 
the play-by-play announcer. On a few occasions I sat in with Gary and did 
color." 
</P>
<P>
 "How did it compare with being a senator?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It was different." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you remember your first trip to Fenway?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell appears stumped, gazing at the Capitol's fancy marble work. He 
ruminates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember one of my brothers taking me to see the Yankees," he says 
finally. "I remember DiMaggio hitting a long ball that was just foul. It must 
have been just after the war." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is baseball in trouble?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell winks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nice try," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mitchell says he has not been offered the commissioner's job, many 
baseball observers say he and the owners already have reached an agreement. One 
of the Boston Red Sox's limited partners with close ties to Mitchell says the 
deal is "99% certain." Mitchell was seen shopping with his fiancee for an 
apartment in Manhattan this spring, fueling speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal is done, Mitchell is in character; he has a history of quietly 
getting what he wants. In 1988, he went after the majority leader's job against 
two better-known senators with more seniority. His opponents campaigned openly. 
Mitchell worked privately to overcome several handicaps: his lack of seniority, 
regional rivalries and reservations about his liberal views. Not until a few 
days before the vote did he publicly acknowledge that he might win. He won on 
the first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Once elected majority leader, Mitchell had a seat at an exclusive poker game 
whose stakes included the White House. Part of Mitchell's job was to prevent a 
second term for former President Bush. Political writer Sidney Blumenthal 
described part of Mitchell's strategy in The New Yorker: "With exquisite 
politesse and delicacy, through a protracted budget summit in 1990, Mitchell 
coaxed George Bush to abandon his iron-clad campaign pledge, 'No New Taxes' -- 
an act that repudiated the Reaganite theology and proved devastating to Bush 
politically." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in no small part to Mitchell, Bill Clinton won the presidency. With 
Mitchell working the inside levers, Clinton's controversial first budget was 
enacted and NAFTA narrowly passed. This year, Mitchell ultimately will shape 
the health-care bill that will be Clinton's most profound legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitchell has paid a price. Mitchell's marriage of 26 years was said to be 
a casualty of politics -- his former wife, Sally did not like Washington, and 
they divorced in 1987. Their daughter, Andrea, a social worker, lives in 
Portland, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Jay Leno, meeting Mitchell backstage at a taping of "Meet The Press," 
asked him, "Is it true you're engaged to a 35-year-old woman?" Mitchell nodded. 
Leno cracked, "No wonder you're interested in health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, at the University of Maine's Hot Stove banquet, Mitchell gave a 
short talk about the benefit of athletic competition and teamwork. His end 
remarks, at once soothing and challenging, could well have been a 
commissioner's inaugural address. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the most fortunate people ever to have lived, to be citizens of the 
most open, most just, most fair society in all of human history," Mitchell 
said. "To be sure, we are an imperfect society, as are all human institutions. 
But one in which we continually strive to identify problems and work toward 
solving them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what we need, not just those in the Maine baseball program, but all of 
us: an appreciation of our good fortune to be Americans, a willingness to 
identify what's wrong and a willingness to work to correct those problems. I 
look forward to working with all of you."

 Rob Dibble's return to the mound was exciting and encouraging to the 
recovering reliever, but painful to one of the Cincinnati coaches who batted 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dibble threw batting practice to coaches Joel Youngblood and Ray Knight and 
draft choice Aaron Boone before Saturday night's game against Colorado. It was 
the first time he had faced batters since surgery in April to repair torn 
cartilage and damage from small tears in the rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw 35 pitches, including one that nailed Youngblood in the leg. Dibble 
interpreted it as a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I usually start spring training -- drilling guys," Dibble said. 
"He didn't even move. He was trying to get a base on me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee Manager Phil Garner said he's sticking with Teddy Higuera for 
today's start against Cleveland and that the struggling left-hander shouldn't 
feel any pressure to keep his spot in the rotation or even his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a start just like any other start," Garner said. "There's no reason to 
put his head in a guillotine." 
</P>
<P>
 Higuera has given up 18 earned runs in 8 1/3 innings in his last three starts 
for a 19.45 earned-run average. Overall, he's 1-4 with a 7.19 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Higuera is still trying to bounce back from rotator cuff surgery in 1991 and 
he insists he's fine physically. The Brewers say he hasn't lost any zip on his 
fastball, which has been clocked in the mid-80s since spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner is counting on Higuera being able to turn things around against the 
Indians, who are 4-12 against left-handed starters. Higuera's best start came 
against Cleveland on May 19, when he gave up two earned runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers also are unlikely to release Higuera because they would have to 
pay his full $3-million salary, a portion of which they could save if the 
players go on strike later this season.

AUTO RACING; EXCITING RACE LOOMS FOR NASCAR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year's NASCAR manufacturers' championship may well wind up the most 
interesting run ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that teams running Ford Thunderbirds outnumber the Chevrolet 
Lumina operations by 2-1 in some Winston Cup events, after 12 races the 
championship is deadlocked at 90 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Each make has six victories so far, with four different drivers giving Chevy 
its wins and Ford getting checkered flags only from series point leader Ernie 
Irvan and Rusty Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 483 starting positions in the first dozen races this season, Ford 
drivers outnumber Chevrolet pilots 265-162. Pontiac, which has yet to win and 
is a distant third in the standings, has 56 total starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevrolet is bidding for its 11th championship in the past 12 seasons and 
second in a row. Chevy has won 18 of the 22 titles since NASCAR's modern era 
began in 1972 -- the year the schedule was trimmed to 31 or fewer events per 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 During that period, Chevrolets have won 274 of 662 races, a .414 winning 
percentage. Ford has won 135 times (.204). 
</P>
<P>
 If a recent pattern prevails, a Chevy driver will win today's race at Pocono. 
The two makes have taken turns in the past six events, with Wallace giving Ford 
a victory last Sunday at Dover, Del. 
</P>
<P>
 A LITTLE cooperation between friendly enemies can go a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Wallace and Ernie Irvan, who are not teammates, definitely worked as a 
team last Sunday at Dover Downs International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was obvious to Wallace that either he or Irvan probably would win the 
Budweiser 500, he decided cooperation was essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace radioed to his crew to send someone down to Irvan's pit to arrange a 
friendly draft that would save both cars until it was time to decide the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ernie pulled up alongside me and gave me the thumbs up," Wallace said after 
winning. "Away we went." 
</P>
<P>
 The fans certainly didn't lose in the deal. With both cars fairly fresh near 
the end of the long, tough race, Wallace and Irvan battled hard, exchanging the 
lead four times in five laps. 
</P>
<P>
 BOB LATFORD, publisher of the weekly "The Inside Line" Winston Cup newsletter, 
says Pocono International Raceway, with its three distinct turns on a 2.5-mile 
tri-oval, "was apparently designed by committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Some teams certainly must believe that, since Pocono, the site of Sunday's 
UAW-GM Teamwork 500, is probably the most unusual track on NASCAR's top 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The first turn is banked 14 degrees, the second -- or tunnel -- turn is 8 
degrees, while the third turn is a relatively flat 6 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the turns also is built on a different radius and the connecting 
straights are all different, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The frontstretch is the longest at 3,740 feet. The Long Pond straight, 
connecting turns one and two, is 3,055 feet, while the North Straight, between 
turns two and three, is just 1,780 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the only superspeedway -- tracks one mile or longer -- on which 
drivers shift gears other than on restarts or when pitting. The track is so 
difficult to set up for that many of the teams have opted to use Jericho 
transmissions that allow the driver to shift without using the clutch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pocono track surface also remains one of the roughest on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't find a real good compromise to get you through all three turns, 
Sunday is a very, very long day," said Kyle Petty, the defending race champion. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN 22-YEAR-OLD wunderkind Jeff Gordon won at Charlotte last month, he became 
the 144th different race winner since NASCAR was formed in 1949. Gordon is just 
the 43rd driver to win a race since the series began its modern era in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngster joins Sterling Marlin, the Daytona 500 winner, as new winners in 
1994. It had been more than two years -- Dale Jarrett at Michigan in August 
1991 -- since there was a first-time winner on the stock car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 THERE HAVE BEEN six different winners so far this season, with series leader 
Ernie Irvan, runner-up and defending champion Dale Earnhardt and Rusty Wallace 
each winning three times. 
</P>
<P>
 The other victories have gone to Jeff Gordon, Sterling Marlin and Terry 
Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
 For Labonte, the victory -- his first since 1989 -- was very gratifying. But 
the win in April at North Wilkesoro has been one of the few high points of the 
season for the former Winston Cup champion. 
</P>
<P>
 During a six-week stretch following the team's victory, Labonte had some 
unusually bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 For three consecutive events, the Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet was damaged 
in on-track incidents initiated by other cars. In two of those events -- 
Talladega and Sears Point -- Labonte was eliminated while running in the top 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 Things haven't gotten much better since, with Labonte falling from seventh in 
the points following his win to 15th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not complaining because we've already won a race and, as competitive as 
it's gotten, we're one of the few teams that can say that. But we've been 
pretty good almost everywhere we've been this season, and to not be able to put 
good finishes with good runs is tough, maybe more so on the crew than on the 
driver." 
</P>
<P>
 THE TITLE sponsorship of today's race at Pocono is a product of the UAW-GM 
Human Resource Center in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is used by the United Auto Workers' International Union and General 
Motors Corp., to developed and administer joint education and training 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 16,000 UAW-GM workers live or work within a 200-mile radius of Pocono 
International Raceway in Long Pond, Pa., including facilities in Pennsylvania, 
New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The new corporate involvement will also include a UAW-GM Teammwork Award of 
Excellence to be presented to the crew-driver-car combination best displaying 
teammwork during each Winston Cup event. A year-end award also will be 
presented to the team with the best overall performance during the 1994 season.

HADES OF HULTON ROAD; OAKMONT OFFERS A TEST OF THE THREE P'S: PATIENCE, 
PRECISENESS AND PERSISTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ROBINSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe time and tradition have dulled it down and dressed it up, stripped it of 
the unforgiving river-sand furrowed bunkers and whitewashed away some of its 
character and cantankerousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Be assured, however, that Oakmont Country Club -- nine decades old and proud, 
an unrelenting 6,946-yard, 4 1/2-hour test of patience, preciseness and 
persistence -- remains one hellish lady of a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't call it the Hades of Hulton Road for nothing, and it will be called 
plenty more names, many of them unmentionable, by the time the U.S. Open 
concludes next Sunday. History says so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The course is sensational," former British Open champion Ian Baker-Finch 
said. "Every green is different and has its own feel to it. It will be good to 
go back there." 
</P>
<P>
 His sentiments aren't shared by all. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been 11 years since the U.S. Open last visited Oakmont, since the world's 
best golfers battled through its unfathomable rough and slick greens and two 
lightning storms only to be brought to their knees again by a one-of-a-kind 
monument of America golf, a National Historical Landmark whose stubborn 
personality has never been altered by mere physical changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled unpretentiously in an unruffled but hardly tiny residential community 
a dozen miles from Pittsburgh, alongside a restored red-brick main street and 
prettied up by a half-million dollars worth of trees and flowers, Oakmont looks 
deceptively tranquil, peaceful and unchallenging. Until the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble, and history, await around every corner, lie in each of its 165 
sandpit fairway and greenside bunkers, threaten on skittish greens so fast the 
Stimpmeter was designed just to measure them. Great golfers have won great 
championships here, but many more have been lost -- just ask Sam Snead, or 
Arnold Palmer, or Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 The legend of Jack Nicklaus began here at age 22 in 1962, when he survived an 
18-hole playoff to conquer King Arnie in Palmer's own western Pennsylvania 
playpen and win his first major championship. Nicklaus had turned pro only 
seven months before and certainly wasn't the crowd favorite, not here in Arnie 
Country. Golf would never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry to say that he'll be around for a long time," a disappointed but 
prescient Palmer said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll both be around for the Open this time, Arnie and Jack, playing 
partners in a specially arranged practice round Tuesday that will unleash an 
Arnie's Army-sized contingent of fans upon Oakmont's lushness. Palmer hasn't 
played in an Open in 10 years, but the USGA wasn't about to deny him an 
exemption for this homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, aided by a soggy course that drained the meanness from Oakmont's 
greens, Johnny Miller won the Open with an historic final-round 63, maybe the 
greatest round of championship golf ever played. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years before, Ben Hogan continued his greatest season -- he also won 
the 1953 Masters and British Open -- by beating runner-up Snead by six strokes. 
Hogan's par-birdie-birdie, 3-3-3 finish remains the stuff of legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakmont, of course, wasn't always that easy. Hardly. Tommy Armour couldn't 
even break 300 while winning in 1927, defeating Harry Cooper in a playoff after 
they had tied at 301. Cooper would have won in regulation if he hadn't putted 
off the 17th green and into a bunker during an early round. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Parks won in 1935 by shooting a 299 to defeat Jimmy Thomson by two 
strokes, and, fittingly enough, later became a U.S. Steel executive and one of 
Oakmont's 250 members. The USGA president that year was Prescott Bush, whose 
son, George, became better known for his baseball than his golf -- and for 
becoming the 41st president of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson couldn't hold his final-round lead, or hold off Larry Nelson, in 1983. 
Nelson barely made the cut, then fired a 65-67 finish to edge Watson in a 
rain-delayed tournament that wasn't completed until Monday morning, before only 
a few thousand spectators and hours before the tape-delayed ending was shown on 
national TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakmont has been modernized, and demystified, since its founding in 1903 -- 50 
members quit when its first swimming pool was built in 1954, and many more 
retain grudges against the USGA for ordering the furrowed bunkers to be made 
less intimidating in 1953, for the 5-inch rough to be shortened in 1983. Once 
barren of water or trees, Oakmont now has as many trees as any premier U.S. 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Oakmont's members still include the wealthy corporate executives, 
there's also a familiar name or two such as Penguins star Mario Lemieux, whose 
$42 million contract allows him to easily afford Oakmont's $30,000 initiation 
fee and $220-a-month dues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oakmont is still Oakmont, a testament to its founder, steel magnate Henry 
C. Fownes, who purchased a 191-acre farmland tract just after the turn of the 
century and built one of the world's greatest golf courses atop its rough, 
rock-strewn turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Fownes' son, William C., the 1915 U.S. Amateur champion, took on Oakmont as 
his personal cause, made it even tougher, built row upon row of sandpit bunkers 
with their 3-foot-high ridges of grass, tightened its 26-yard-wide fairways, 
made sure that any mistake or foolish boldness was severely penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "A shot poorly played should be a shot irrevocably lost," was Fownes' 
philosophy. There wasn't a drop of lake or stream water on the course and still 
isn't, but a Saraha-like 3,900-square yard sandpit guards the 253-yard eighth 
hole and an ominous 95-yard Church Pew bunker protects the historic 15th, with 
its green so big that 180-foot putts are possible. 
</P>
<P>
 So frustrated by these greens, a disheartened Chick Evans resorted to using 
the handle of his umbrella to hole out on the 14th after failing three times 
with his putter during the 1919 U.S. Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade after Oakmont's opening, a banquet speaker recited this oft-recalled 
rhyme: 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fownes stood by a green one day When someone holed in four. "I'll put a 
stop to that," said he. "I'll build two bunkers more."  
</P>
<P>
 He built them, all right. He also built a legend.

GALLERY: ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a love story. There's Gary Johnson. There's his wife, Kari. And then 
there are the elephants. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary bought his first elephant at 16.Kari grew up with them; she was raised in 
a family of animal trainers. Now they are married and living in Perris, Calif., 
with 11 Asian elephants, two dogs and some cats on a ranch called Have Trunk 
Will Travel. 
</P>
<P>
 They are one big happy family, and like any family, they have their routines. 
After breakfast, there's a walk around the compound. Gary and Kari stroll side 
by side, hand in hand; the elephants follow, single file, tail in trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Johnsons like to share their special family. They believe that by showing 
people the gentleness of the endangered animals, and the humane way to care for 
them, they can save those pachyderms not in captivity. The demand in other 
countries for ivory tusks means more elephants are dying in the wild than are 
being born. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Johnsons trot the elephants out for county and state fairs, magazine 
covers, commercials, movies, advertisements and other events. The money helps 
pay for their old age and their present needs -- adult elephants can eat 200 
pounds of hay, grain, fruits and vegetables and drink 50 gallons of water 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this is a love story. And if the Johnsons have their way, the elephants 
will have a happily ever after.

WESTSIDE WATCH: D-DAY MAILER GAVE KNOX THE EDGE IN ASSEMBLY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a long way from the cliffs of Normandy to the hills of West Hollywood, 
Beverly Hills and Westwood, but Wally Knox managed to bridge the gap in a 
last-minute mailing to bolster his successful race for the Democratic 
nomination in the 42nd Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I vote Tuesday, I will dedicate my ballot to those, living and dead, who 
fought in that noble cause," he wrote on an oversize postcard featuring a 
black-and-white photograph of American troops after their landing on the French 
coast 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing his father's war record as a member of a U.S. Army division in France 
and Germany, Knox urged residents to vote and modestly mentioned his own 
military qualifications as "U.S. Army 1967-1971." 
</P>
<P>
 According to his campaign manager, Evelyn Jerome, the younger Knox served as 
an enlisted man in Army Intelligence, based in Germany and Vietnam.

 JUNK MAIL: One Beverly Hills woman found a way to avoid handling the blizzard 
of political mail that arrived in the days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Atop a chair next to her mailbox, the woman placed a trash can, said Jeff 
Crain, an aide to Mark Slavkin, a candidate for the state assembly. On the 
trash can was a sign. 
</P>
<P>
 It said: "Please deposit political mail here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MORE MAIL: Complaints about political mailings even became part of a West 
Hollywood City Council debate over trash hauling. 
</P>
<P>
 As city officials discussed trash collection in a meeting Monday, resident 
Derek Meik rose with a fistful of political mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 17 campaign pieces Meik said he had just received, 10 came from Mayor 
Abbe Land and Councilman Paul Koretz, both running for a state Assembly seat. 
Amid the talk of improving the city's recycling efforts, Meik said, none of the 
campaign mailers came on recycled paper.

 FOR A SONG: An eclectic collection of more than 100 household items from 
Barbra Streisand's three Malibu homes will be up for auction during a giant 
garage sale of sorts being held this weekend by the A.N. Abell Auction Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A French decanter, waffle irons, a toaster, jugs, cups, saucers, rugs, sofas 
and chairs are among the items to be offered today at the Abell auction house 
in Commerce.

HIGH-RISE JITTERS; NEW DOUBTS ABOUT SAFETY AFTER JAN. 17 QUAKE HAUNT 
UPPER-FLOOR OFFICE WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From their 10th-story offices on the corner of Wilshire and Westwood 
boulevards, Darrell and Elizabeth Yamada command a mini-panorama of Westwood 
Village and the Hollywood Hills beyond. The view has given the husband-and-wife 
dental team much pleasure -- and, in post-earthquake Los Angeles, a dose of 
anxiety as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Their jitters have diminished as the aftershocks have subsided, but both say 
spending many of their waking hours in a 12-story building in an area prone to 
shaking still gives them occasional pause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in a while, I think about it, but you have to go (on) with your 
life," said Darrell Yamada, who has occupied the offices for seven years. "You 
accept it as part of the price of living and working in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 That trade-off might be getting trickier for workers in steel-frame mid- and 
high-rise buildings as concern mounts about their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel structures were long thought to be among the safest places to be in an 
earthquake because they can bend without breaking. But the Jan. 17 quake caused 
widespread cracking in the welded connections of beams and columns in at least 
90 such buildings, most of them in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the City Council recently ordered inspections of about 400 
steel-frame buildings. Retrofitting is already under way at many of the 
buildings damaged in the earthquake, but recent tests have shown such repair 
methods to be ineffective when subjected to the stresses of a 7.0 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 So where does that leave the denizens of the Westside's steel-and-glass 
structures? 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly in a state of necessary denial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about it a lot directly after the earthquake, but on a day-to-day 
basis, I don't think about it," said Nathlie Woods, an executive assistant at 
an accounting firm on the ninth floor of a 24-story building in West Los 
Angeles. "Until you brought it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a Los Angeles native who has experienced all the city's recent quakes, 
had never worked in a high-rise until she began her current job six months ago 
-- just in time for January's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 She remains undaunted, saying, "There's always going to be something." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, to many who toil in the city's towers, memories of the massive damage 
caused by January's quake have not faded. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, evidence of the destruction is not hard to find. Just a few miles from 
Woods' office, for example, a six-story medical office building at Olympic 
Boulevard and Barrington Avenue had to be demolished shortly after the quake. 
The building did not topple but it was considered too severely damaged to be 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought about this (happening)," said Alvin Rosenblum, a dentist who 
had offices on the building's third floor and who suffered $450,000 in 
uninsured losses from the temblor. "I assumed that was the safest place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he tries not to dwell too much on the disaster, Rosenblum 
acknowledges that his next permanent offices will be on a building's ground 
floor. "It's preferable to me after the earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a generally calm Elizabeth Yamada admits to being visited by an 
unnerving vision: that of the adjacent mid- and high-rise structures on 
Wilshire Boulevard toppling over like dominoes during a massive quake. "They'd 
be right on top of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, put their faith in modern construction technology. Despite 
the cracking in the skeletons of some steel-framed buildings in the city, none 
came close to collapsing in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 This knowledge puts people such as Lee Alvarez at ease. Alvarez, general 
manager of Monty's Steakhouse on the 21st floor of a Westwood high-rise, has 
experienced many bumps and jolts during her 17 years at the restaurant. 
January's quake may have shaken up some of Monty's employees, but she wasn't 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Even right after the quake, Alvarez said, the thought of the building's 
possible collapse, or of her being in danger, never entered her mind. "It 
doesn't bother me a bit."

ECOLOGY; WHEN NO NEWTS ISN'T GOOD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE MOFFET, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crouched on a rock slab high in the Cold Creek Canyon Preserve near Malibu, 
Pepperdine University student Seth Gamradt scoops up an orange California newt 
that has just snagged a large, struggling spider in the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The newt tries to swim away from Gamradt, but moves too slowly. Its 
half-drowned prey floats downstream, where it is retrieved by Pepperdine 
natural sciences professor Lee Kats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newts are basically scavengers," said Kats, marveling at this newt's 
ambition. "They're not good at catching true aquatic prey, so they hope things 
fall into the water." To catch a spider, he said, is beyond most newts' dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dramatic moment for Kats, 31, who has studied the newts and tree 
frogs at Cold Creek for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the wake of the November wildfires, which torched the preserve, 
ecologists' interest in the tiny creatures has increased as they study how the 
California newts survived the fire and what clues they may offer about the 
overall health of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than most amphibians, (the newts) utilize both aquatic and terrestrial 
habitats," Kats said. "Given that amphibians have such sensitive skins, they're 
very good indicators about anomalous substances in soil and water. If (newts 
are) around, it's a good indicator that the health of the land and water is 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 The preserve, which reopened in mid-May, is lush with new growth and there 
appears to be an abundance of newts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, Kats wondered if the creek's newt population was wiped out by the 
fire. That would have been a great loss since little is known about this newt 
species, one of three found in the state and the only one in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 But this winter and spring, adult newts made their normal migration from land 
to the stream in numbers close to previous years, Kats has learned. Because 
they survived the fire, Kats said, "this really tells us these animals are 
probably at least a foot underground" when on land. 
</P>
<P>
 Kats' research indicates that newt populations elsewhere in the mountains have 
been greatly reduced over the last several years, mainly because they are 
preyed on by such creatures as bullfrogs, crayfish and mosquito fish not found 
in Cold Creek. Development and the proliferation of hiking trails have also 
disturbed their habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the skin of adult newts contain a powerful toxin that makes them an 
unpalatable meal, their nontoxic eggs and larvae are eaten by many creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 And though newts may be abundant at Cold Creek, there is uncertainty about the 
future. The stream was severely affected by the fire's aftermath, with most of 
the deep pools that newts prefer for mating and egg-laying filled with silt. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, only half the normal number of eggs have been laid this spring 
and "the females are laying eggs in very peculiar places," Kats said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, you wouldn't see them lay eggs in anything less than three feet of 
water. Now they're laying eggs in pools only six or seven inches deep. That's 
risky, if (the pools) dry out" before the fishlike larvae can transform to 
newts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the newts have had one stroke of luck -- plenty of earthworms washing 
downstream with the silt. To a hungry newt, "there's nothing better than a 
drowning earthworm," Kats said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he encounters a newt at Cold Creek, Kats sometimes squirts a little water 
down its esophagus to force the contents of its stomach up. He bags the 
contents and takes it back to the lab for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure gives a newt just "a little bit of a bellyache," Kats said, but 
"ecologically it tells us a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Kats has been finding earthworms, not newt eggs, in the animals' 
stomachs, indicating that cannibalism has not been occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newts are not good at capturing fast-moving prey, so their preferred prey is 
slow-moving," Kats said. "Egg masses have filled that role in the past. We 
think in years when the earthworms are not there they're making the best of the 
situation. This year they have other options." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Morin, a Rutgers University biology professor, has called Kats' work on 
cannibalism among newts "cutting-edge" and "fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny California tree frogs, another native, are also still abundant at Cold 
Creek. "My best hunch is they were actually in the water" when the fire roared 
by, Kats said.

BRIEFLY: ANIMALS: COLLEGE GETS $15,000 FOR STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Park Service has awarded Santa Monica College a $15,000 contract 
to conduct an inventory of small mammals, birds and reptiles in the Joshua Tree 
National Monument, the first such study in the monument in over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 students supervised by biology professors Norm Hogg and Walt Sakai 
will study the quantity and location of animals in the monument and also the 
animals' movement, longevity, juvenile-to-adult ratios and male-to-female 
ratios. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is believed to be the first inventory of Joshua Tree fauna to be 
conducted since the period 1945 to 1960, according to Hogg.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LEIMERT PARK; CULTURAL BOOST COMES FROM CAMEROON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leimert Park, the unofficial center of African and African American arts in 
Los Angeles, got a cultural boost last week from a faraway source: Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 150 Cameroonian artists have set up camp in a miniature African village 
in Leimert Park for a week of exhibits, music and dance performances. Although 
the festival is being held in conjunction with the World Cup soccer 
championship tournament, which includes the Cameroonian team, the Indomitable 
Lions, organizers say their larger goal is raising awareness about the Central 
African nation and its traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a great opportunity for a cultural exchange," said Nana 
Maynard of Los Angeles, one of the organizers of the festival, officially 
dubbed "Cameroon for USA '94." "We don't need governments or any other excuse 
to come together." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival kicked off Friday after event volunteers constructed a tent-like 
village on the grassy expanse of Leimert Park at Crenshaw Boulevard and 43rd 
Place. Art exhibits, performances by the dance troupe Ballet Moderne and singer 
Coco Ateba will continue daily through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynard calls the project a "miracle in motion" because the event gelled in a 
matter of weeks on a shoestring budget. Officials at Jemea, a Cameroonian 
cultural promotion outfit, are footing most of the bill for the trip, about 
$150,000, and most of the accommodations for artists have been arranged at USC 
and at private homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jemea began scouting for Los Angeles residents to help produce the event two 
months ago, after director Henri Manga fell in love with the idea of bringing a 
little bit of Africa to America, using the World Cup, which begins Friday at 
the Rose Bowl, as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say we were sort of commandeered into it," publicist Ginger 
Campbell said with a laugh. "But it was such an exciting thing, you could 
hardly say no." 
</P>
<P>
 Jemea, which means "will" or "determination" in the Cameroonian language of 
Duola, pulled together a team of about 20 producers here to organize the Los 
Angeles aspects of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Sequoia Mercier was named Jemea representative in California, a role 
the Crenshaw resident said has engulfed her life for the past several months 
but has been worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really captured me was the fact they wanted to bring so many artists 
here at once," said Mercier, a nurse. "They wanted to introduce the whole world 
to Cameroon . . . so I said I would play matchmaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Said architect Manga Duolla-Bell, a Jemea employee from Cameroon who designed 
the village and oversaw construction: "I chose Leimert Park because of its 
artistic personality and its African feel."

COVER STORY; REELING IN THE PAST; PRESERVATION: THOUSANDS OF OLD FILMS MAY BE 
GONE WITH THE WINDS OF TIME BECAUSE OF CHEMICAL DETERIORATION. BUT UCLA'S 
ARCHIVE IS TRYING TO SAVE THE BEST OF THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hunting through a Warner Brothers film vault three years ago, Bob Gitt, chief 
preservationist of the UCLA film and television archive, came across what 
looked like a gem. there, amid piles of corroded film canisters and dusty 
shelving, sat a 12-reel original print of "The Divine Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 A long-lost, Academy Award-winning work of 1929, the film featured one of the 
period's great beauties, Corinne Griffith. It portrayed the romance between 
Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton, all spliced between sea battles (off Catalina 
Island). 
</P>
<P>
 With great excitement, Gitt ripped open each can -- only to find a sticky 
brown powder, the residue of deteriorated nitrate film stock. Of the 12 reels, 
only two could be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Such disappointment is familiar to movie historians and archivists. Experts 
say that of the 21,000 Hollywood-produced shorts and feature films made before 
1950 on nitrate stock, the primary material of the period, about half have been 
lost forever, including 90% of all silent movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the problem is most evident at UCLA's film and television archive, the 
world's largest repository of feature films next to the Library of Congress. In 
the archive's cinema department, an underfunded team of three specialists has 
had to resort to an unnerving triage to decide which of the thousands of films 
are most in need of preservation for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our films are under siege, and as the years go by the process is 
accelerating," Gitt said. "We're doing the best we can and preserving the most 
important rare films. But we can't always predict what people will think is 
important in 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is considered crucial, particularly given the growing historical 
importance of visual media. Some experts suggest that, one day, historians will 
rely on moving images as much as on the printed word to understand 20th-Century 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "The UCLA archive is truly staggering in terms of its cultural significance, 
but is still viewed as a nonessential specialty," said Michael Friend, director 
of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Film Archive. "Film 
resources are as integral as books but are not recognized as the art form of 
our times." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Film and Television Archive holds about 40,000 short films and feature 
titles in the old Technicolor plant, now called the Television Center Building, 
on the corner of Romaine and Cahuenga avenues in Hollywood. In addition, the 
archive houses about 27 million feet of Hearst Metrotone newsreel footage and 
more than 40,000 television programs and titles. 
</P>
<P>
 The archive's feature film department was founded in 1972 after Paramount 
donated a large number of its old nitrate-film prints to UCLA. Prints from 
Twentieth Century Fox, Warner Brothers, Republic and RKO Pictures soon 
followed. The archive began a television collection in 1965 in association with 
the Academy of Television Arts and Science. 
</P>
<P>
 The feature-film collection includes camp classics; movies considered 
important for artistic, historical or technological reasons, and "orphan films" 
-- features discarded by studios or original prints donated by a director's 
widow, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 The archive also receives prints from independent and retired producers, 
celebrities and private collectors, and it borrows films from archives all over 
the world. Staffers also hunt for obscure movies in forgotten studio vaults and 
warehouses and act on tips from movie aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 In the archive's cool, dark corridors, roughly 10,000 nitrate films are stored 
in 60 double-door vaults on three floors. A separate section of the building 
houses about 30,000 acetate-based films, a stock widely used after 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the acetate-based films are in need of preservation, but that stock is 
slightly more durable than the older nitrate-based films, which have spawned 
the preservationists' caveat: "Nitrate won't wait." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Gitt says, about 400 feature films, 5,000 hours of newsreels and about 
300 videotaped television titles are in urgent need of preservation at UCLA. 
The archive is concentrating most of its limited resources on its huge -- and 
aging -- feature film collection, mindful that an increasing number of titles 
will require attention every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Features on the center's critical list include Gene Autry's 1946 film "Sioux 
City Sue"; "Shantytown," a 1943 movie starring John Archer and Marjorie Lord; a 
late '20s short titled "A Day With Jack Dempsey," and the complete 12-film 
Sherlock Holmes series made by Universal Pictures from 1942 to 1946. Gitt says 
one movie in the series, "Sherlock Holmes and the Spider Woman," has suffered 
significant nitrate deterioration on three of its seven reels. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects are among many cinematic rescue efforts under way at the archive. 
The center's three feature film technicians manage to preserve or restore only 
about 25 shorts and 15 longer features per year -- a pace, they admit, that 
does not match the deterioration rate of movie footage. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started working here, I felt awful," said Jere Guldin, the 
archive's vault manager. "There are certain things you just can't save." 
</P>
<P>
 Preservation means lengthening the life of a film, often by transferring a 
movie from nitrate stock to longer-lasting acetate or polyester film. 
Restoration involves the enhancement of an inferior or incomplete original 
print so a copy can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Many old films require both types of this work, which is arduous and 
expensive. Gitt estimates that the cost of preserving and restoring a 90-minute 
black and white film is about $20,000 and can exceed $60,000 for a color 
feature. The archive's vinyl-gloved technicians must remove all dirt and grit 
on the film with razor blades and cut out scratched portions with scissors. 
Film sprockets often need replacing and ripped splices re-gluing. 
</P>
<P>
 New images must be edited in -- sometimes after being culled from other 
archives. Gitt eventually restored "The Divine Lady" after the Czech Film 
Archives found two separate prints of the film, though these were slightly 
damaged and speckled with Czech titles. Often sound must be enhanced and 
synchronized with the original track. And, throughout, extreme care must be 
taken with nitrate film, which is extremely flammable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be passionately meticulous and sometimes it's difficult to just 
relax and enjoy the art of these films because the clock is always ticking," 
said Eric Aijala, a UCLA archive preservationist. "I try to make sure I get the 
space I need to be creative and do the detail. Otherwise, I wouldn't sleep at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the pressure is the difficulty of prioritizing restoration projects. 
Even if there's a consensus now on which movies merit immediate attention, 
there's also the concern that future generations may disagree. Film buffs cite 
film noir, a genre from the '50s expressing urban anxiety and paranoia, as an 
example of a discarded style that decades later became popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the UCLA archive's struggles come amid a surge in film restoration 
work by the major studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the decades, as films evolved from silent to sound to color, many 
Hollywood studios shunted their old pictures off to warehouses. But yesterday's 
film dust has turned into today's nitrate gold with the proliferation of video, 
pay-per-view, cable and satellite transmissions -- and the prospect of 
fiber-optic distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Programmers are now scrambling to feed the entertainment maw, hunting for -- 
among other things -- old films. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago, you couldn't get money for film preservation," said Ralph 
Sargent, president of Film Technology Inc., a Hollywood-based restoration lab. 
"The studios now realize preserving their old films is a form of asset 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Turner's purchase of the MGM film library in 1986 for $1.3 billion was 
once viewed as a gross overpayment. With the "information superhighway" on the 
nation's horizon, the move is now recognized to have been extremely shrewd. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner Entertainment has already preserved and restored 20 of 115 classic MGM 
Technicolor films from the 1938-1953 era -- including "The Wizard of Oz" and 
"Gone With the Wind" -- at a cost of about $70,000 each, says Dick May, vice 
president of Turner Entertainment, which owns the film libraries of MGM, RKO 
Pictures and parts of Warner Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company spends about $1.4 million a year on restoration and preservation, 
May said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is to preserve everything. We are making protection masters of our 
3,300 feature films," May said. "Eventually we'll have high-definition 
television, and the public is becoming more knowledgeable about a quality 
image. They want beautiful pictures and they deserve to be seen that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Some studios are experimenting with advanced restoration techniques that 
involve transferring old film images to a digital medium, electronically 
enhancing them and then transferring the pictures back to 35-millimeter film. 
</P>
<P>
 "The high-end electronic technology can make images pristine, get rid of the 
scratches and blemishes. But it can be so expensive," said Phil Murphy, an 
archivist for Paramount Pictures. "Completing 10 minutes of film can cost 
$250,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said that in the past six years, Paramount has made two sets of 
negatives of all 900 of its studios' films, storing each print in separate, 
refrigerated and humidity-controlled vaults, one on each coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA archive, however, has far fewer resources for restoration than the 
studios do, so expensive, high-tech film rescue projects must be chosen 
carefully. Archivists say that until the costs of technology come down, which 
could take years, their technicians are stuck with the time-consuming dirty 
work of manual repair. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's preservation efforts receive thousands of dollars a year from such 
sources as Martin Scorcese, the David and Lucille Packard Foundation, Sony 
Pictures Entertainment, the Mary Pickford Foundation and Hugh Hefner. Sometimes 
the studios sponsor a joint project with the archive. Other funding comes from 
the university and from government grants. 
</P>
<P>
 But with an annual budget of only $350,000 for feature film preservation, the 
archive's resources pale in comparison to the task. Bob Rosen, director of the 
UCLA Film Archive, says it would cost $50 million to save all the archive's 
endangered features. "The cost of two big-budget movies or a B-1 bomber would 
cover it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of titles needing prompt attention, he added, time could run 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rosen: "Five hundred years from now, people will look back on this 
century, the century that discovered film, and ask, 'Why didn't they take 
better care?' "

NEWSREEL, TV STOCK ALSO ENDANGERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feature films are not the only endangered items in the UCLA Film and 
Television Archive; historic newsreel and television footage also needs saving. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the archive's most precious film is the 27 million feet of Hearst 
Metrotone newsreels donated to the university in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The footage, the second-largest newsreel collection in the country, was 
recorded by cameramen working for the Hearst news organization from 1919-67. It 
documents such key events as the 1930s Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the 1940 
Russo-Finland War and the bombing of Guernica in the Spanish Civil War. It also 
chronicles social trends ranging from jitterbug dancing to fashion shows. 
</P>
<P>
 However, about 10 million feet of the original prints are on deteriorating 
nitrate stock that is slowly disintegrating despite the frantic efforts of the 
archive's two newsreel preservationists. Funded by an annual budget of about 
$120,000, the two technicians restore and preserve about 10 hours of film a 
year, out of a total stock of 5,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not only a visual record of the 20th Century but a reflection of how 
the stories were told," said Blaine Bartell, head of the UCLA newsreel 
preservation program. "There's almost a greater urgency with newsreels because 
there are no multiple copies, and if we don't preserve the film, it's gone 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Hearst's cameramen originally shipped their footage by rail, ship or air to 
New York, where it was edited into 10-minute newsreels distributed to theaters 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a shortage of funds, the newsreel preservationists have been hobbled 
by the old Hearst news department's practice of cutting up finished stories 
into bits and pieces for future use as stock footage. Compiling a complete reel 
is like reconstructing a huge jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartell said a 1986 restoration of a 12-minute reel of the May, 1937, 
explosion of the Hindenburg airship cost about $3,000 and took nearly two years 
of painstaking labor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the finished prints offer a fascinating glimpse of a time long past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting to see the way they reported the Nazi book burnings," 
Bartell said. "It was like, 'Hey, Hitler's boys are having a hot time 
tonight."' 
</P>
<P>
 Other restored film includes Marian Anderson's 1939 concert in front of the 
Lincoln Memorial, an event sponsored by Eleanor Roosevelt after Anderson had 
been banned from singing at a Daughters of the American Revolution function 
because of her skin color. There is also footage of 12-year-old Robert Kennedy 
heading to England with his family in 1939, Babe Ruth signing a contract that 
contained a pay cut, President Franklin D. Roosevelt welcoming Admiral Richard 
Byrd home from Antarctica and the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in 
1941. 
</P>
<P>
 The archive's television department, meanwhile, has assumed growing 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Einstein, the department's only preservationist, presides over a $25,000 
annual budget seeking to collect and preserve a growing inventory of about 
40,000 titles. About 90% of the collection is American and includes anthology 
dramas, sitcoms, children's programs, documentaries, local newscasts, 
cablecasting and live shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1956, most television programs were recorded on a kinescope, a camera 
with motion picture film. Then came the jump to two-inch videotape and a 
progression of changing video formats. But Einstein says video is no better 
than nitrate; the material often peels, images deteriorate and the quality 
fades after copying. 
</P>
<P>
 The center preserves from 30 to 150 programs a year depending on funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're almost more concerned with getting material before its thrown away," 
Einstein said. "There's been so much dumping over the years by the networks and 
producers who didn't know any better." 
</P>
<P>
 But Einstein says a new consciousness is emerging that television programs, 
like feature films and newsreels, are cultural assets worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Einstein's favorite restorations include one of the most honored 
television programs in history, an early 1958 color video titled "An Evening 
With Fred Astaire," segments of the Watts riots from the Big News -- a 1965 
newscast with Jerry Dunphy and Ralph Story -- and a montage of Grammy award 
shows from 1963-70. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is currently working on restoring a color videotape of the 
Nixon-Khrushchev kitchen debate in 1959. ADRIAN MAHER

SCHOOL: CRENSHAW HIGH'S CLASSROOM TARDINESS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can anyone tell me what is wrong with Crenshaw High School demanding that its 
students be in class on time? ("Angry over Absences," Westside, June 5) This is 
invaluable training for the outside world, where punctuality is a basic 
requirement to obtain and hold a job. Does Jacinto Rhines think he is doing his 
daughter a service by attempting to undermine the school that is trying to 
teach her this virtue? Will Mr. Rhines also file a lawsuit against an employer 
who fires his daughter for being repeatedly late to work? 
</P>
<P>
 Tardy students interrupt the educational process for everyone else in the 
class. Why aren't parents like Mr. Rhines putting their energy into teaching 
their children the value of promptness? Why don't they spend a week at Crenshaw 
High School with their children, showing them how it is possible to travel from 
Class A to Class B in a timely fashion? Better yet, show them how to be in 
their seats with their pencils sharpened and ready to learn when the tardy bell 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel it is Mr. Rhines, not Crenshaw High School, that is practicing 
"miseducation." Why is he dragging race into this? If "black kids are 
disproportionately suffering," it probably means that black kids are 
disproportionately late to class. How wonderful that the principal, Yvonne 
Noble, and the assistant principal, Yolanda Anderson (both of whom are black) 
care enough to do something about an unfortunate situation. Mr. Rhines should 
thank his lucky stars that his daughter is in a school that's doing its best to 
impact her in a positive way. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a simple message here: If you care that much about your child's 
education, make sure that she (or he) is on time to class! Then, everyone wins.

FOR SENIORS; OCTOGENARIAN TOILS TO PLANT SEEDS OF TREE AWARENESS

<P>
 Her eyes have a childlike quality. They're curious, seeking. But the eyes 
don't jibe with the tremor in her hand. She readily admits that her memory 
sometimes disappoints her. Her physical presence is slight but when she claps 
her hands after making a discovery about her beloved eucalyptus trees, it's 
clear there's a force to be reckoned with here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think I lead a charmed life; it always gives me what I need," 
says Grace Heintz, 89, from her modest apartment in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since she was a 4-year-old in her native Wisconsin, Heintz has been 
picking up things from the earth and asking, "What is this?" So it's no 
surprise that she can name every kind of tree in Santa Monica, has revised a 
book on the subject and wrote one of her own, "Trees of Santa Monica," in 1988. 
She taught herself to ride a bicycle at age 65 and rode all over the city 
identifying the variety of eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a former grade-school teacher who several years ago took a botany 
course at Santa Monica College and developed a passion for eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
 She has driven a camper throughout the state to identify the trees. Of the 700 
varieties of eucalyptus tree, Heintz has identified 500 in California. And 
established a reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bauml, senior biologist for the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum, 
has known Heintz for 13 years and has used her on many occasions to verify 
trees in the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anyone else who has a broader or deeper knowledge of the 
eucalyptus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Los Angeles Zoo wanted to acquire koalas from Australia, Heintz was 
called in. Why? Because koalas only eat 17 varieties of eucalyptus leaves and 
she could identify whether those varieties were available. 
</P>
<P>
 She made the identifications and the leaves were sent to Australia to test on 
the animals. They concurred with Heintz. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago she received a call that would change her life. A stranger 
called and told her to get over to Lincoln Park because something terrible had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went immediately," Heintz recalled. "When I got there, there was a wire 
fence around the park. Some man said I would have to leave. I told him I wanted 
to see my tree. It was 75 years old. He said, 'They aren't there anymore.' I 
could see that but I wanted to walk to where it was." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a significant moment for Heintz, to look through the wire fence at the 
spot where something of grandeur once was. "I knew it was my destiny to fight 
the city and prevent this from happening again even though it's completely 
foreign to my nature to do something like that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She talks about a eucalyptus tree as if it were family. Like the eucalyptus 
deanei she identified on 24th Street and Marguerita Avenue in Santa Monica. She 
found out that it was going to be chopped down to make room for a house. "The 
tree filled me with awe. I went and talked to the neighbors about it and it was 
saved and the house was built anyway," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heintz says she has this habit that when she starts something, she can't stop 
it. She decided to speak before the Santa Monica Parks and Recreation Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had people there from the Native Plant Society who are plant bigots. 
They can't believe eucalyptus are good enough trees. They say they're bad -- 
get too big, droop their limbs. They said they shouldn't be planted because 
they're not natives. They had their minds made up and they didn't listen," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that only one type of eucalyptus, the brandis, actually droops its 
limbs, and only at night. Heintz believes that people like John Lynd, manager 
of parks and sports for the city of Santa Monica, must go. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynd says the city's official policy is not to remove healthy trees. Although 
the trees in Lincoln Park were healthy, a section of the park was redesigned 
and the plan called for the removal of the healthy gray gum eucalyptus -- a 
species that no longer exists in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do plan on replanting but not with eucalyptus trees for now. We do have a 
plan for the future which includes the gray gum," he said. "In fact, Grace is 
growing some for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynd said he always turns down requests to remove trees and added that "Santa 
Monica has one of the nicest urban forests of 28,000 city-owned trees." 
</P>
<P>
 So, as she enters her ninth decade, Grace Heintz is starting a movement. A 
kind of tree politics is growing and attracting people who share her love of 
trees. They decided to model themselves after a group in Pacific Palisades 
called Palisades Beautiful, except instead of only planting trees as they do in 
the Palisades, the Santa Monica group would preserve what they have and get rid 
of the people who favor chopping them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do need to keep watch on what the city is doing. I suspect I'm the 
inspiration. I want this bad thing of chopping down these trees to turn into 
something good. The city has to get straightened on what they can and can't do. 
As for me, I always want to further my knowledge so keeping these trees is 
important to my studies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will be called Santa Monica Beautiful and its goals are to preserve 
what is already growing, make recommendations to the city after careful 
analysis of what new trees should be planted and monitor the city's tree 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 She's been called the "Johnny Appleseed" of California eucalyptus. Now she's 
planting the seeds of tree awareness. After the fight with the city, she wants 
to establish tree walks where schoolchildren and adults are taught about the 
beauty in their midst.

BOOBY-TRAPPED ONION PATCH KILLS OWNER, SON

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man and his son were electrocuted by a booby trap they had set up to protect 
their onion patch against thieves, a Bucharest newspaper said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Florian Iorga, 42, and his 16-year-old son, Aurel, were found dead Friday in 
their pajamas among the onions behind their Bucharest house, the daily 
Evenimentul Zilei said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were searching the garden after hearing noises in the night and 
evidently stepped on the wires. Iorga set the trap after thieves had stolen 
onions and threatened him with violence when he reported them.

PARENTS, LEADERS ASSAIL POLICE PHOTOS OF YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 100 parents, youths and civic leaders gathered at a Vietnamese community 
center here Saturday to protest the police practice of photographing Asian 
youths and others for gang "mug" files and find out how to protect their 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of stereotyping. Police base who they stop on the clothes, 
which is really unfair to us. It's just a fashion, like bell bottoms," said 
Jeff Huang, 19, of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Huang, an Orange Coast College student, recently joined the Alliance for Asian 
Rights and Responsibilities, which sponsored Saturday's "Copwatch" forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering came in the wake of a class-action federal lawsuit filed last 
month against the City of Garden Grove and its Police Department on behalf of 
two Vietnamese American girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls say they were stopped and photographed solely because of their baggy 
clothes -- a police practice that community activists say is on the rise and 
smacks of discrimination. Police counter that the mug books have helped solve 
crimes, and say they only stop and photograph youths if they have a "reasonable 
suspicion" that the teens are affiliated with a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Forum organizers said they hoped to set up a countywide "Copwatch" network to 
monitor police activities, and form support groups for Asian parents, as well 
as high-school age youths who might be photographed.  
</P>
<P>
 They also passed out wallet-size cards Saturday instructing youths that they 
have the right to say "no" if police officers attempt to photograph them 
without making an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The card advises youths to report all such incidents to the alliance, known as 
AWARE, and is inscribed on the back with this declaration: "I do NOT give 
permission to police or other law enforcement personnel to take any photographs 
of me." The card has a space for a signature, and a parent's signature if the 
youth is under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "In school they're taught to say 'no' to drugs. Well, we're asking them to say 
'no' to police abuse," said Daniel Tsang, a founding member of the group, which 
grew last September out of a Fountain Valley organization formed to fight that 
Police Department's mug book policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsang said the card will work better than merely requesting police to seek 
parental permission before photographing youths, because, he said, "Asian 
parents would just give police permission," believing that their children must 
have done something to warrant the police stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a table draped by a banner emblazoned "End Racist Mug Files," Van 
Pham, the mother of Tustin High School honor student Quyen Pham -- one of the 
two girls who sued last month -- appealed to audience members to support their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 She told parents who gathered at the offices of the Vietnamese Community of 
Southern California to teach their children that they do not have to consent to 
be photographed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is not right," Pham said. "Even after they screened my daughter on 
the computer and it came up clear, they still photographed her. . . . We are 
trying to change the policy for innocent, good kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers stressed that the community remains indebted to police officers for 
their services, but people resent what they see as tendencies to stereotype all 
Asians as either model minorities or gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an anti-police issue. It's an anti-policy issue," said JoAnn 
Kanshige, who founded the Fountain Valley group that gave rise to AWARE after 
her 20-year-old son was photographed by police two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanshige said all minority groups are affected by the photo policy, practiced 
by police departments in some Orange County cities, including Garden Grove, 
Westminster and Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On Kanshige's invitation, members of the Latino community also attended 
Saturday's forum, which was supported by Los Amigos of Orange County, the 
Mexican American Legal and Educational Fund and the League of United Latin 
American Citizens, among other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Cortez of the Chicano Poets Society addressed the group, which had 
thinned to about 20 people by the end of the afternoon, with a fierce poem he 
titled "Miranda Forgot One." The one neglected Miranda right, his poem 
declared, was the "right to say 'no' " to a mug file Polaroid. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo Song, a 20-year-old economics and political science major at UC Irvine, 
called the event "eye-opening." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he understands how the photos can be helpful to the police, but he 
said the mistrust the policy is fomenting in the community outweighs any 
potential benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think just because of the trust issue, it's something that needs to be 
stopped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others echoed that sentiment, saying that "good" youths have become embittered 
toward police and mainstream society by the photo stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a child is thinking he's the proper student, the proper citizen, and 
then is told, 'No, you're not,' what kind of psychological effect will that 
have on a child?" said John Hirano, executive director of the Westminster-based 
Asian-Pacific Leadership Council, who brought his younger sister and brother to 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a possibility of deep psychological core problems. I think it 
could lead kids into doing bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Huang, the Orange Coast College student, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're really rude to us," he said. "That's why our attitude toward police 
is bad. If none of this had gone on, we wouldn't feel this way."

MARINE WIDOW'S RETREAT TO DISILLUSIONMENT; MILITARY: CAROL BENTZLIN REJECTS 
OFFICIAL VERSION OF 'FRIENDLY FIRE' IN SAUDI ARABIA. HER BITTERNESS IS AIMED AT 
PENTAGON, DEFENSE CONTRACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Persian Gulf War, which killed her Marine husband in a "friendly 
fire" accident, Carol Bentzlin knew well the role of the perfect military wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 'God bless America, apple pie and rah, rah, rah,' " she recalled. "At 
one time, I really believed all that. At one time, I was that. But not any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 A widow with three children, Bentzlin, 32, lost her husband, Camp Pendleton 
Marine Cpl. Stephen E. Bentzlin, 23, for reasons that still remain hazy to her. 
What information she has pieced together has come at a price, not the least of 
which is a loss of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 For her, the memory of war never really fades, especially when there are 
always headlines to remind her. Just last month, her anger was reawakened by 
the news that a defense contractor had been cleared of wrongdoing in connection 
with the fatal accident that robbed her of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Her story is one of bitterness -- at the government whose policies placed her 
husband in a war she considers pointless; and at what she calls a cover-up that 
kept her and the families of other Marines killed in the same accident from 
learning the how and why. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day," she said, "I'm not sure I know exactly what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentzlin's husband and six other Pendleton Marines perished in the first land 
battle of Operation Desert Storm in January, 1991, when their lightly armored 
vehicle was hit by a missile fired from a U.S. Air Force A-10. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened in Umm Hujul, a coastal region about 60 miles from Khafji, a 
northern Saudi Arabian border town seized by Iraqi troops. Compounding 
Bentzlin's bitterness was a remark made by now-retired Gen. H. Norman 
Schwarzkopf, the allied commander, who described the battle as "militarily 
insignificant . . . a mosquito on an elephant." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be able to tell my children something different," Bentzlin said. 
"If it was so worthless, then why did my husband die? Why was he even there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bentzlin's post-war anger reached a crescendo last month when a Garden City, 
N.Y., aerospace firm, Lucas Aul, was cleared of causing the deaths of the seven 
Marines, despite the firm's admission that it falsified test results for 
defective missile-launcher parts. The firm's admission was part of a plea 
bargain with the U.S. Justice Department, which took action against Lucas Aul 
after a two-year investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentzlin believes her husband's death was caused by defects in the "LEUs" -- 
launch electronic units -- made by Lucas Aul or by an errant firing of the 
missile itself. The missile was made by Hughes Aircraft Corp., which, for 
reasons of national security, has been granted immunity from litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea bargain last month in U.S. District Court, Lucas Aul pleaded guilty 
to a felony charge of deliberately submitting falsified results and agreed to 
pay the government $4 million in fines, $7.5 million in restitution for the 
faulty parts and $500,000 for the cost of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas Aul acknowledged that employees had falsified test results, indicating 
that the LEUs had passed vibration, severe weather and current-flow tests. The 
units, which help pilots fire missiles such as those used in Saudi Arabia, were 
manufactured under a $54-million classified government contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the plea bargain, Lucas Aul, the subsidiary of a 
multimillion-dollar British-owned defense contractor, Lucas Industries, was 
absolved of any wrongdoing. Bentzlin and other survivors played no role in the 
proceedings and knew only recently, she said, that the government had even 
placed the firm under question. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the inquiry made no attempt to discover how the friendly fire mistake 
happened, Bentzlin viewed the action as highly symbolic "only to have it, too, 
end in a typically crushing disappointment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Renate Myles, the spokeswoman for Lucas Industries, said the company's LEUs 
played no role in the accident and thus the plea bargain had no relevance to 
Cpl. Bentzlin's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unfortunate what happened," Myles said. "But Lucas is not the 
problem and never has been. Our (LEU) was not even on the aircraft in question, 
but unfortunately, a lot of people want to see this as a big conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who's to blame for what happened in Saudi Arabia, Bentzlin said 
she is furious at what she regards as the secrecy surrounding her husband's 
death and insists that, without the involvement of the American press, she 
would still be largely in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing surprises me," she said of the plea bargain. "It's scary as hell, the 
lengths they'll go to protect defense contractors at the expense of American 
lives. But most people just put up with it." 
</P>
<P>
 What angers her the most, she said, is the time it took to "find out anything" 
about what was behind her husband's death. "The military is ridiculously 
private. They just don't think it's any of your damn business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Steve had died in a traffic accident, the police would have told me 
everything that happened," she said. "I could have gotten an autopsy report, 
which the military would never release. With (the Marines), it was shrouded in 
secrecy from the moment it happened. And what I want to know is why." 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Fred Peck, the spokesman for Camp Pendleton, disputes Bentzlin's version 
of events, saying that, while he feels for her loss as a widow, the accident 
that took 11 lives in all "was reported early on as friendly fire. The 
circumstances of the accident have been investigated exhaustively. We don't 
know that we'll ever be able to determine exactly what happened. But I would 
categorically deny that we only reacted in response to her complaints in the 
news media, which she's accused us of on numerous occasions." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Warrant Officer Robert C. Jenks, a Marine Corps spokesman in Washington, 
called Bentzlin's charge that the military engaged in a cover-up surrounding 
her husband's death patently untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation was very thorough, painstaking," Jenks said. "It was a 
tragedy, a national tragedy, but there was no cover-up." 
</P>
<P>
 After her husband's death, Bentzlin said she knew nothing until seven months 
later, in August, 1991, when, after her complaints were aired in the press, she 
received a call from Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah, Kuwait's ambassador to the 
United States, with whom she met the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Bentzlin died, the ambassador told her, when an allied missile 
mistakenly struck the armored vehicle carrying him and the other members of his 
unit, all from Camp Pendleton. All but one perished in the accident that U.S. 
authorities eventually labeled friendly fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after it happened, military authorities told Bentzlin in a letter 
that her husband had been killed by enemy fire and that no investigation was 
warranted. Military officials have since acknowledged sending the letter and 
concede they made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Bentzlin's complaint, aired through the press and responded to by the 
Kuwaiti ambassador, was that the Marine Corps was slow in returning her 
husband's personal effects -- most of which were love letters -- and paying her 
the second half of $100,000 in death benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine was a simple question that deserved a simple answer," she said angrily. 
"But I had to claw and scratch and fight for everything I could." 
</P>
<P>
 She received no response whatsoever, Bentzlin said, until the day after her 
meeting with the ambassador about eight months after her husband's death. "And 
I'm sure it was just a coincidence that everything came through the day after I 
talked with him," she said sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck, the Marine spokesman, said Bentzlin received her full benefit payment 
and her husband's effects "as soon as it was humanly possible." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Orange County who grew up in Costa Mesa and Tustin, Bentzlin had 
been previously married before she met the man who died in Saudi Arabia. Her 
first husband is also a Marine; he fathered her three children, ages 13, 12 and 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 After they divorced, she met Bentzlin, a rifleman, a "grunt," she says with a 
laugh, "and the best man I ever knew -- my lover, my husband, the best father 
my kids could have had, even though he was really their stepfather." 
</P>
<P>
 Her youngest son, Ricky, has taken the death especially hard, Bentzlin said, 
"and that $100,000? It's gone. I bought a house, a car, but mostly, I paid off 
debts. You soon learn in the Marine Corps that you never have money. Mostly, 
you just owe everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 She met Stephen Bentzlin at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in 1987, "and," 
she said, "we recovered together." 
</P>
<P>
 They were married about a year before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on his life, it was his devotion to duty "that just astounds me," 
she said. "His loyalty, his patriotism, his love for America." 
</P>
<P>
 But someone, she said, ought to be held accountable for his death, whether 
it's the maker of the missile, or the LEU . . . whomever. In her view, somebody 
ought to suffer besides her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't happen," she said. "If I drink and drive, I have to be held 
responsible. But these guys are absolved from all responsibility, and it just 
isn't right. It concerns me. And it should concern every American."

DISNEY'S LOST AND FOUND; TALES OF MISSING CHILDREN HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To 9-year-old Noemi Rodriquez, Disneyland wasn't such a small world, after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely 4 feet tall, the elementary school student from Janitzio, Mexico, 
remembered staring up at the 147-foot-high Matterhorn on a recent sunny 
afternoon. When she dropped her gaze to look for her teachers and classmates, 
they had vanished into a sea of Magic Kingdom visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 She was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Noemi is one of scores of children who are separated from their parents or 
adult supervisors every day at one of Southern California's largest tourist 
attractions. With the summer season bringing in bigger and bigger crowds to the 
world-famous park, the number of lost children can climb into the hundreds, 
Disney officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 While traumatic for adults and children alike, the experience is especially 
tough on youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get kicked. We get thrown up on," said Ginger, who does her best to calm 
kids at the park's Lost Children facility, a holding station where younger 
children are kept until a parent or chaperon arrives. (As a matter of policy, 
Disneyland does not permit the release of the last names or other personal 
information about park employees.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The poor little things get so panicky," Ginger said. "It breaks your heart to 
see them this way." 
</P>
<P>
 But image-conscious Disney officials are quick to point out that there is 
always a happy ending to their lost boy and girl stories. Unlike the Lost Boys 
in Never Never Land, a vast majority of lost children at Disneyland are 
rejoined with adults within a few minutes, officials said. And in its 34-year 
history, Disney has never failed to reunite a child with his parents or 
chaperon before the park closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never lost a child at Disneyland," said Verna, another worker in the 
Lost Children facility. 
</P>
<P>
 While a perfect record may reassure parents, it unfortunately offers little 
comfort to a frightened child like Noemi Rodriquez. In tears after realizing 
her predicament, Noemi was quickly spotted by two park employees, who combed 
the immediate area for her group of 40 classmates and eight teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, such a search usually turns up the child's guardian within 15 
minutes, park officials said. But in Noemi's case, it did not. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-old was brought to the Lost Children facility, just off Main 
Street. Had she been 12 or older, she would have been escorted to the park's 
City Hall instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside Lost Children, youngsters can play with toys, read Disney books or 
watch television (the Disney Channel, of course) as they wait to be picked up. 
Housed in a small quiet room, the air-conditioned facility also has a VCR, a 
pair of comfortable sofas and a handful of chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 During summer months, as many as 30 kids are sent to Lost Children each day. A 
recent Fourth of July -- traditionally the busiest day of the year at 
Disneyland -- saw more than 200 children in and out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just chaos," said Verna, a gray-haired great-grandmother experienced 
in nurturing young children. "Thank goodness we haven't had another day like 
that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney intentionally chooses older women to staff Lost Children in hopes the 
motherly figure will help soothe troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a sexist thing," said Disney spokeswoman Pam Espinosa. "From our 
observations, children seem more comfortable with the grandmotherly types." 
</P>
<P>
 In Noemi's case, the effect seemed to work. Though separated by language, the 
little girl appeared comforted by Verna, whose eyes welled up with tears as she 
embraced the sobbing child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so horrible," Verna told the girl. "Everything is going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 After about an hour "in station" -- as Lost Children is referred to in the 
park -- news came that a teacher from Noemi's school had been spotted by an 
alert employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so happy," said her teacher, Eduardo Cisneros, giving Noemi a hug. "We 
are responsible for her. Thank you. Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, parents and adults berate themselves for allowing their children to 
escape their supervision, officials said. Several parents refused to talk about 
their experience, fearing it would make them appear irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a neglectful parent," said one mother who headed off toward 
Tomorrowland after being reunited with her child. 
</P>
<P>
 But park officials tell parents not to blame themselves. With an 86-acre park 
and tens of thousands of visitors per day, combined with the park's excitement 
and distractions, separations can occur easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them not to be too hard on themselves," Espinosa said. "The park can 
be overwhelming, especially on a first visit." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Kevin Stewart from Hesperia found it easy enough to get lost. 
Kevin remembered standing with his mom in Toontown. Then the Jolly Trolley went 
rolling by, and he lost her. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin, who admitted this was his second time in Lost Children in two 
years, seemed to take his sidetracked status in stride. He spent his time 
assembling jigsaw puzzles, playing with Legos and inquiring how he might 
install a laser "like the one in Star Tours" in his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 After about 45 minutes, Kevin's mother, Sylvia Stewart, showed up. Smiles lit 
up both their faces, and they hugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went around the ghost house and you weren't there," said Kevin, who was 
supposed to wait at the Haunted Mansion for his mother in case they split up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have just missed you," said Sylvia, 32, clutching her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, come on," replied the boy, tiring of the reunion and eager to go to Star 
Tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Separation from a child at the park is also a trying experience for parents 
and chaperons. Robert McCollum, a truck driver from Las Vegas, had a scare when 
he couldn't find his companion's 8-year-old daughter, Carrie White. The 
second-grader disappeared near Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was praying, 'God, Jesus, find her,' " said McCollum, 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Frantic for nearly an hour, McCollum finally got word that Carrie was safe at 
Lost Children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found her. I don't know how they did it, but they did," said McCollum, 
holding Carrie's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a happy ending," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the way Disney likes it. Staying in Touch 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips to prevent losing children at Disneyland: 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan ahead: Establish a specific meeting time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clothing: Wear something easily identifiable from a distance; attach 
something recognizable to the back of your pants or skirt at your children's 
eye level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay put: After a parade or show, stay put. It's easier to spot someone 
while standing still. 
</P>
<P>
 * Visit City Hall, Lost Children: Stop by City Hall (ages 13 and older) and 
Lost Children (ages 3-12) with your children so they will know where they need 
to go in case you become separated. Lost Children has special name tags for 
children to wear if they are too young to communicate. Lost Children is near 
the Plaza Inn Restaurant on Main Street; City Hall is near the main entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 IF YOU BECOME SEPARATED. . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't panic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remain in the area where you last saw the person. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask an employee to call Lost Children or City Hall to see if anyone has 
escorted your child to either location. Give child's full name, age and a 
complete description. 
</P>
<P>
 * Send a member of your party to nearest restroom or food or merchandise 
location. Older children with cash sometimes go there. 
</P>
<P>
 * On warm days, children often retreat to a cool spot. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you're staying at an area hotel, call to check if your child has 
returned.

LAUGHING THROUGH THE PAIN; TROUPE OF THE MENTALLY ILL USES COMEDY TO SPREAD 
UNDERSTANDING AND ERASE STIGMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you hear the one about the mentally ill comic? 
</P>
<P>
 He's no joke. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Billy Moody, 44, survivor of Vietnam, heroin addiction and 
schizophrenia, in that order. Moody is a big thinker: For instance, he used to 
believe he was Jesus Christ II. The voices told him so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it (was) pretty hilarious," Moody remembered. "They said: 'You will 
be a great healer. . . . There will be no more sickness, no more mental 
problems.' And I was believing them." 
</P>
<P>
 On medication now, Moody no longer considers himself a messiah, but he is 
still going for miracles. The latest is a doozy: raising public awareness to 
remove the stigma of mental illness. Laugh if you want -- there's more. He is 
part of a comedy troupe, the 14th Street Players, in which nearly every 
performer is mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 They do skits and improvisation. Sometimes Moody plays an eccentric 
psychiatrist. Cast members enact scenes from "Dazed of Our Lives" or discuss 
that new book: "Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Psychiatric Medication 
. . . but Were Too Sedated to Ask." They go for lunch at Jack In Seclusion. 
"May I have your disorder, please?" the cashier asks cheerfully. Moody requests 
the Freud chicken. The cashier inquires again: "Will there be any side 
effects?" 
</P>
<P>
 The yuks go on and on. Off-Broadway theater? Very far off. The players do 
hospitals, universities and mental health conferences. Patrons are asked to can 
their sympathy at the door. In their black "Stigma Busters" T-shirts, the 
actors make a simple point: The mentally ill are just people. They can have 
fun, tell jokes. They're not dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you happen to be one -- hey, don't be ashamed. You can put on a smile, 
try to make something of yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at (the troupe) and say: 'Oh, they had a little depression, took 
some Valium, Prozac,' " said Carrie Bray, an actress who formed the group 12 
years ago at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Westwood. "No. This is 
schizophrenia. This is bipolar (disorder). These people have been hospitalized; 
(one has) had electro-shock treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can do it . . . up on that stage, you people out there suffering, you 
can be like that." 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds like ready pathos, forget it. That was how the troupe started, 
trying to act out sober insights into the anguish of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the first pratfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was bad," Bray recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy proved the only way to keep an audience. The troupe was the first of 
its kind in the nation, Bray said. Its members -- about 10 at any given time -- 
have traveled to 33 states, spinning off 22 similar troupes, Bray said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not the real punch line, though. What may be more remarkable, the 
actors said, is how the Los Angeles troupe has endured. Four members of the 
original cast are still at it. Moody and several others joined eight or 10 
years ago. Together, that core group has kept the gags going despite suicide 
attempts, funding cuts and enough other crises to wipe a grin off anyone's 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, the troupe learned to mask their suffering; offstage, they learned to 
deal with it, at least a little. The group was not intended as therapy, but in 
comedy, surprise is everything. Cast members found a purpose. They became 
friends. Not only do they rehearse and perform together, they stay in touch by 
phone, discussing jokes, hospital wards, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of us thinks of the Players as a second family," said Rowena (Ro) 
Duron Leist, 41, whose bouts of severe depression may be rooted in a tormented 
childhood; who says her father once tried to hold her head in an oven. "I can 
tell any of the Players, or Carrie, anything. It's kind of like we're all on 
call for each other, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year." 
</P>
<P>
 As personal troubles go, Leist is not least. The good news is, those staples 
in her stomach -- the ones that curbed her weight problem -- don't bother her 
anymore. This year, doctors took out the stomach. Suicide attempts? Leist 
figures she has racked up 15. But there may be a few others, she said, that 
were zapped from her memory by the electric shock treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Leist was working at a Pasadena dental lab in 1981. One evening she drove home 
crying, for no real reason. She went straight to the medicine cabinet. "I took 
every pill in the house and washed it down with a bottle of booze," she said. 
"I thought that was it -- it was over." 
</P>
<P>
 That was her entree into the mental health system. She woke up in a 
psychiatric ward, where she embarked on a failed series of anti-depressant 
drugs before her doctors hauled out the electrodes. 
</P>
<P>
 In those traumatic early months of treatment, Leist was dragged by a friend to 
a meeting of the new theatrical group at Robertson Recreation Center on the 
Westside. Leist hid in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going, 'I don't want any part of this,' " she said. " 'There's no way 
I'm going to get up in front of people (and act).' " 
</P>
<P>
 However, no one else emerged as the next Phyllis Diller, or Bill Cosby. The 
chorus line that inaugural year was something akin to the Personal Horror 
Revue. Actors included Eleanor Alpert, who at age 4 had begun fearing the 
household furniture -- it seemed to her to move; Ron Marshall, who had leaped 
out a second-floor window at 14 on the false belief that there was a fire; and 
Gail Green, who had spent years hearing voices and trying to kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with other performers who came and went later, cast members began 
learning the disciplines of the stage. Bray had no formal psychiatric training. 
She had been on the far fringes of the mental health system -- the star of 
"Carrie's Corner," a puppet show on public television in Stanislaus County. It 
taught children about divorce, anger and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray's philosophy was: Troupe members had to see themselves as actors, not 
mental cases. "You can't tell the difference when we're up onstage," Green 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leist remembered that in college she needed four semesters to pass a beginning 
speech class; every time a speech was due, she would drop out. "I just turned 
around completely," she said. "All of a sudden I got put in a show, and I just 
started doing it. Now, I don't shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Project Return Players, as they were originally known, got funding through 
the nonprofit Mental Health Assn. of Los Angeles, which began sending them 
nationwide. The road became an act unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
 At a convention in San Francisco, 2,000 psychiatrists gave the troupe a 
standing ovation. At Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk, a teen-age girl 
told Leist that she had been trying all morning to figure out how to kill 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The show had made the girl smile. "That's pretty monumental," Leist said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the basic, B-movie types of farce: the time in South Carolina, 
for example, that Green was bitten by a fire ant. Turned out, she was allergic 
to fire ants. While she bloated up and collapsed, Bray had to do some fast 
stigma busting, assuring bystanders that no, this was not some effect of mental 
illness. Paramedics administered oxygen and epinephrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost literally died," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the noisy night getting lost on the back roads of Ohio, 
singing in the van; or that flight home from Kansas on Halloween night, when 
the plane kept hitting downdrafts in a thunderstorm, dropping 1,000 feet at a 
time -- or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 All the travel and rehearsals paid off, though. The troupe was featured on 
Cable News Network. A documentary was filmed. A sound engineer on the video, 
Eames Demetrios, later made a feature-length film of his own -- "The Giving" -- 
dealing with mental illness and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 It screened at film festivals in Houston, Chicago and Egypt before showing in 
a limited release in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Important roles in the 
art film were played by Alpert, Green and Moody, who auditioned alongside 
actors who were not mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "They carried the story," Demetrios said of the troupe. "They brought a lot of 
different qualities and life experiences to the film, and they also delivered 
as performers." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Adams, president of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 
discovered the troupe in the mid-1980s while flipping channels on public 
television. He brought Leist and Bray to his own hometown, Des Moines, Iowa, to 
launch the Central Iowa Players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Alliance thinks this is a very important component (in) what 
we're trying to do to educate the people," said Adams, whose son Mitchell was 
found to be mentally ill in 1986. Mitchell still performs with the Central Iowa 
Players when not tutoring university physics students. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Los Angeles cast made halting progress toward better lives. 
Green and Marshall, who had been living in board-and-care homes, eventually got 
their own apartments, at Bray's urging. Green became less suicidal. Her closest 
call since joining the Players occurred six years ago, Bray said, when she put 
a shotgun in her mouth, then changed her mind and checked herself into the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new medication can cause leukemia, so Green takes a blood test every week. 
But the voices have stopped. She now jokes about being lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody had lost a guard job when his schizophrenia took hold; he kept giving 
away merchandise and removing the bullets from his gun. But, with treatment, he 
found other work, married and is now raising two sons. Joining the Players 10 
years ago furthered his progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming out of the mental-health system, I had a reluctance to trust other 
people," said Moody, who now does casework for the Mental Health Assn. in Long 
Beach. "It has allowed me to trust . . . to come out of a shell." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpert never left her board-and-care home. She is still too terrified. 
</P>
<P>
 Leist became Bray's assistant, handling travel logistics and budgeting. For a 
while, she also left messages on Bray's answering machine: She had taken the 
pills, she was ending it all. Love, Ro. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'd have to call the paramedics," Bray said. That happened four or five 
times, she said, and in the late '80s Leist went through a second series of 
electric shock treatments. Her stomach-stapling operation came in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the health problems, Leist was actually improving. Then, wham. In 
1992, the Players found out that their funding -- all $65,000 a year -- was 
doing a Houdini. The troupe had become one more target of far-reaching budget 
reductions in mental health. 
</P>
<P>
 Leist went right back into the hospital. The Players were angry, depressed and 
directionless, all at once. Bray's salary was gone. There was no more travel 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of improv, however, is tackling the unexpected. Bray and her cast 
members decided to stay together, to laugh it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the road trips have stopped and performances are less frequent, the 
show goes on. The troupe renamed itself after 14th Street in Oakland, where 
Bray grew up doing childhood theater. At the Players' most recent rehearsal, 
actress Valerie Harper showed up. Harper is planning a TV movie about the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bray spends a few hundred a month from her own pocket and tries to 
line up grants. Last spring, she was maid of honor at Leist's wedding. After 
getting out of the hospital, Leist married a truck driver. The whole cast had a 
party for her a few months afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amazingly enough, she's never missed a show or a workshop," Bray said of 
Leist, "unless she was in the hospital. That became her lifeline to society -- 
our group. Laughter is the best medicine."

BILL BOYARSKY: 'VANITY CANDIDATES' PAVE THEIR WAY WITH GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuesday's election showed that the vanity candidate has become as much a part 
of our political life as television commercials and campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 By vanity candidate, I mean someone who, after earning a lot of money, decides 
that his or her mastery of American capitalism is a qualification for high 
public office. So, as political unknowns, they sink a pile of their wealth into 
getting known, the first step in winning office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Perot is the most famous vanity candidate, although he gets an asterisk 
after his name because he jumped in and out and back into the 1992 presidential 
race. Richard Riordan, on the other hand, seemed to thrive on political heat 
and kept his wealth flowing until he was elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, we had computer software multimillionaire Ron Unz, who 
unsuccessfully challenged Gov. Pete Wilson for the Republican gubernatorial 
nomination. But the most interesting example is the race that will add to the 
legend of California political zaniness -- Rep. Michael Huffington's campaign 
for the Senate. Huffington won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate by 
spending more than $6.5 million of his $75 million oil fortune in the primary. 
Just a year and a half ago, he poured $5.4 million into his successful campaign 
for the House. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm fascinated by the phenomena of the vanity candidates and how they seem a 
perfect fit for the chaotic, unstructured politics of California. I'm curious 
about what drives them to spend their wealth on something as grueling and risky 
as a political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was this curiosity, more than anything, that drew me to the big Republican 
party Tuesday night at the Westin, near Los Angeles International Airport, 
where Huffington was scheduled to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd read about him and his wife, Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington, author and 
discoverer of "The Fourth Instinct." (In case you haven't read the book, the 
fourth instinct is volunteerism. The other three are survival, power and sex.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you were making a movie about a Texas oil millionaire and his wife spending 
their way from the House to the Senate to the White House, you'd cast the 
pleasant-looking Huffington as the candidate and the striking Arianna as the 
spouse. In a scene that a director might have conceived, the Huffingtons 
appeared on the ballroom stage, holding their two small children. About 100 
young men and women crowded directly in front of them, waving banners and 
shouting, "Huffington! Huffington!" 
</P>
<P>
 Since I didn't know the Huffingtons, I figured they wouldn't level with me 
about why they were spending all that money. But I do happen to know another 
candidate who ran a successful self-financed campaign. So on Thursday morning, 
I went to see Kathleen Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell, winner of the Democratic nomination for state controller, had put 
$1.3 million of her money into her campaign. Although she was a political 
novice, running against two pros, she got 49% of the vote, more than twice as 
much as her nearest competitor, and will face Republican Tom McClintock in the 
November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't run for office as an outsider unless you are willing to invest some 
of your own assets in the race if you want to be considered seriously," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike most vanity candidates, Connell plans to take her campaign 
mainstream in the general election, relying on contributions rather than the 
family account. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell has a confident manner that comes from her success in the 
high-pressure bond market. I had met her in another stage of her life, more 
than a decade ago, when she was Mayor Tom Bradley's first chief of the city 
housing department. The daughter of a middle-class family, she'd gone through 
college and graduate school on scholarships and by working.  
</P>
<P>
 Connell left the Bradley Administration to take a job with Chemical Bank's 
bond department in New York. "Those were good times," she said. "Those were the 
'80s on Wall Street. I made considerably more than I made for the city. My 
lifestyle changed dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to California late in 1985, she joined the UCLA business school 
faculty as head of the finance and real estate department. She also began a 
financial consulting and investment banking business and married Bob 
Levenstein, a land developer. They have two small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends, she said, had urged her to run for public office. But she wasn't 
interested until she was head of the Rebuild L.A. investment task force and 
watched government fail to promote investment in new, job-creating businesses. 
With Controller Gray Davis planning to run for lieutenant governor, his office 
was open. Connell figured her background was perfect for a job that is 
basically financial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they're right for the job or not, Connell and the other self-financed 
candidates impose a special burden on us voters. It's hard to judge them 
because they have little or no record of votes or other public actions. 
Huffington, for example, has not completed his first congressional term. Unz 
was a total unknown until he spent a couple of million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The news media will have to dog these newcomers, tenaciously recording their 
words and nail them for whatever inconsistencies crop up in their campaigns. 
The voters must be interested enough to pay attention, which is unlikely 
considering the low turnout in the primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 This process, of course, ignores the talented unknown who doesn't have money. 
There's no place for such a person in today's elections. That's why we need 
public financing of campaigns.

EXPERIMENTAL SCHOOL HAILS FIRST GRADUATING CLASS; EDUCATION: ALL 114 SENIORS AT 
ACADEMY OF MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE, MANY OF THEM MINORITY MEMBERS FROM 
LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, ARE GOING TO COLLEGE.

<P>
 On a brilliant mid-September morning in 1990, the small faculty of a bold new 
public high school waited anxiously in a parking lot at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills for the five buses that would bring the diverse group of ninth-graders 
chosen to be the first students of the California Academy of Mathematics and 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were as nervous as the students," Principal Kathleen Clark said. "We kept 
asking ourselves, 'Will this school work?' " 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, as those same students -- now the seniors who made up the 
school's first graduating class -- gathered in the college gymnasium for 
commencement, the answer was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 All 114 of the students, recruited from eight school districts in Los Angeles 
County, are entering college in the fall, some bound for such prestigious 
universities as Stanford, Brown, MIT, Caltech, UC Berkeley and UCLA. Many of 
them, by taking Dominguez Hills courses as electives during their junior and 
senior years, have enough university credits to begin as sophomores. About 70% 
have chosen careers in math, science or technical fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they have racked up more than half a million dollars in scholarships 
and won scores of national academic prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the graduating seniors are women, and 85% are minorities, a 
reflection of the academy's goal of increasing their numbers in science and 
technical professions. Some live in poverty, and many are the sons and 
daughters of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who delivered the keynote address and then stuck around to 
shake each graduate's hand when diplomas were handed out, told students: "Your 
success is something we want to see replicated across this state. . . . Each of 
you has the potential to do extraordinary things." 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors' achievements have helped earn the young academy accolades as one 
of the nation's most successful experiments in public school reform, and many 
of the ideas are being emulated in other, more traditional California high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy began as a partnership of the state Department of Education, local 
school districts, the Cal State University system and several corporations. 
With the high school housed on the college campus, the students receive a 
demanding curriculum and have full access to university facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, students get mentors -- volunteers working in math- or 
science-related careers who counsel and advise them. There are internships, 
summer enrichment programs and tours to visit colleges nationwide, most of it 
paid for from grants or from the $4.5 million in private support the academy 
enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
 Although each student chosen for the 500-student academy showed promise in 
math and science, they were not all from the ranks of the academically elite. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for more than just the top math students," Clark said. "We are 
looking for kids who are really motivated, who really want to be here."  
</P>
<P>
 By accepting at least two students each year from 60 schools in the 
participating districts, the academy gets a strong ethnic mix -- 28% Latino, 
28% black, 29% Asian American, 14% white and 1% Native American. They come from 
the Long Beach, Compton, Los Angeles, Inglewood, Torrance, Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, Hawthorne and Lawndale school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 New graduate Marsha Sargeant, 17, who will enter New York University in the 
fall and wants to become a doctor, said the personal attention she received was 
most important to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here is really caring -- the teachers, the counselors, the kids -- 
we're all very close-knit. I don't think I could have had any better 
preparation for college," said Sargeant, of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Aguiar, 18, who had been headed for Jefferson High in his South-Central 
Los Angeles neighborhood when he got accepted to the academy four years ago, 
said he felt some pangs about no longer going to school with his childhood 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I made new friends," said Aguiar, who will become a premed student at 
Columbia University in the fall. "I liked our group projects, taking college 
classes, learning to be organized. . . . It was tough, but it was worth it."

CONSERVANCY EXTENDS REACH FAR BEYOND SANTA MONICAS; PARKLAND: AGENCY DEFENDS 
EFFORTS TO BUY ACREAGE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND NEAR LA HABRA HEIGHTS. 
CRITICS SAY IT SHOULD SPEND MONEY LOCALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With far-flung land deals pending in Santa Barbara County and the southern end 
of Los Angeles County, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is on the verge 
of outgrowing its name once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malibu-based state agency has long operated outside its namesake 
mountains, expanding by legislative fiat and legal consent into the Antelope 
Valley and the rim of the Valley corridor that encircles the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an acceleration of the trend, the conservancy is poised to divert $3.7 
million in voter-approved park funds -- that were to be spent locally -- to 
purchase property outside its normal base of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two pending land deals were approved this year by the Legislature. Unless Gov. 
Pete Wilson issues a line-item veto this summer, the conservancy will have the 
authority to negotiate the purchase of: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 780-acre swath of Santa Barbara County's Santa Ynez Valley that would 
become part of a 6,000-acre outdoor laboratory affiliated with the UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 546-acre parcel near the city of La Habra Heights that is considered a key 
wildlife corridor between the San Gabriel Mountains and Cleveland National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy critics acknowledge that the deals would preserve valuable 
wildlife habitat but contend that the conservancy is legally obligated to spend 
the money locally. Opposition is expected to intensify after Tuesday's defeat 
of a $2-billion park bond measure, a loss that limits the conservancy's ability 
to buy land within its usual sphere of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an outrage," said Mary Wiesbrock, president of Save Open Space-Santa 
Monica Mountains, a local environmental group. "It's just the wrong use of this 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 But conservancy officials defend their actions, saying that they did not seek 
to expand their domain but are doing so at the behest of powerful state 
politicians who control the agency's purse strings. They hasten to add that 
they also support the acquisitions. "If you only focus on the Santa Monica 
Mountains and don't worry about other areas, you end up with a biological 
island," said Liz Cheadle, the conservancy's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding would come from the conservancy's share of Proposition 117, a 
statewide wildlife protection initiative approved by voters in 1990. The law 
guaranteed the conservancy $50 million over a five-year period, to be spent 
"within the Santa Monica Mountains zone, the rim of the Valley corridor and the 
Santa Clarita woodlands." 
</P>
<P>
 But conservancy officials said they may legally spend the money outside the 
designated area with the approval of the Legislature -- an opinion disputed by 
critics. The two proposed acquisitions would divert about 37% of the 
conservancy's annual $10 million allocated through Proposition 117 from the 
agency's normal operating sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be funneled through the conservancy's two sister agencies in 
Whittier and Ventura County, which may purchase parkland outside their 
prescribed base of operations, according to an attorney general's opinion 
obtained by the conservancy two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some state parks officials are also critical of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to save an ecosystem in the Santa Monicas, and by no means is 
the work complete," said Suzanne Goode, associate resource ecologist with state 
Department of Parks and Recreation. "If the money gets spread too thin, we 
won't be able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed deals also anger property owners who were counting on the 
conservancy to buy their land with money from the bond measure that failed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep promising us they'll buy our land, and they keep breaking their 
promises," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials said they had little choice but to accede to the desires 
of Assembly members who approached them for technical and financial assistance 
in purchasing the Santa Ynez Valley and La Habra Heights parcels. The 
Legislature created the conservancy and can abolish it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of battles to fight in the Legislature, and you have to pick 
and choose which ones to fight," Cheadle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents said the proposed acquisitions would benefit all Southern 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara property would be deeded to the University of California's 
Natural Reserve System, producing ecological research that could aid the entire 
region, said Bruce Mahall, a UC Santa Barbara professor involved in the 
preservation effort. The land is part of Sedgwick Ranch, a former cattle ranch 
with breathtaking views, most of which is already owned by the university. 
</P>
<P>
 The parcel is for sale for $2.9 million, and environmentalists fear that a 
developer will buy it and build ranchettes unless the conservancy helps acquire 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of preserving mountains here or mountains there," said 
Claire Schlotterbeck of Hills for Everyone, an environmental group composed of 
residents of Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange counties. "We're 
all in this together."

SCOTT HARRIS: SEEKING AN IDENTITY AND AIR CONDITIONING 
</P>

<P>
 Fred looked deep into my eyes. "If I could get $2,000 for your car," he said, 
"can we make a deal today?" 
</P>
<P>
 I could feel the heat rise in my face. I hate that. 
</P>
<P>
 Few things in life are quite so disagreeable as negotiations with a "closer" 
in the auto trade. But it's part of the process if you want to buy a new car -- 
or, for that matter, a new "pre-owned" car, such as the '93 Maxima I'd been 
eyeing the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice. Very nice. The color is "charcoal pearl." The odometer is just over 
13,000. And it's "top of the line," as they say, with a premium sound system, a 
spoiler and power everything, including "moonroof." Looked brand new, save for 
that tiny dent near the back right wheel hub. "We can pop that out," Rich, the 
salesman, assured me. 
</P>
<P>
 It lacks leather, but of course has air conditioning. And now that I do most 
of my driving in the Valley, a/c has become a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, this Maxima might be too nice -- and not just because the 
price is at the center field wall of my ballpark. Five words keep pressing 
against my skull: You are what you drive. Am I just shopping for a car -- or 
seeking a change of identity? 
</P>
<P>
 This much is obvious: I haven't been myself lately. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started when I started having transmission trouble. Why spend $650 
fixing a ratty red '86 Mustang LX convertible that has an L-shaped scar in the 
ragtop (so styled by an unknown burglar) when you don't want to face another 
Valley summer without a/c? Determined to dump my Mustang as a trade-in, I 
borrowed a company car -- an aging Pontiac Grand Am with a bent front fender -- 
and set out on my search. 
</P>
<P>
 With each car lot, with each test drive, I came to realize I wasn't merely 
shopping for wheels. It had become a mission of self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Who am I, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 At first, of course, I was essentially my parents' youngest. At 15 1/2, they 
put me behind the wheel of the '69 Dodge Dart, teaching me to drive in a local 
cemetery. Once I cut a corner too sharply. "You're running over dead people," 
my father scolded. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bland car, not me at all. So I rebelled by seeing how fast it could 
go on the freeway. Would you believe 104 m.p.h.? 
</P>
<P>
 At 17, when my brother went bumming around Europe, I happily adopted his 
persona -- a hot little VW bug, with custom purplish-blue paint and gold spider 
mags. 
</P>
<P>
 At 18, I had the first car I could truly call my own -- an 11-year-old '66 
Datsun wagon with a flaking aqua paint job. A scruffy car for a scruffy 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a birthday gift from Dad, who had bought this little number from one of 
his buddies at The Swinging Door for $400. A fair price. I could putt-putt-putt 
down the road and, because the gearshift sock was missing, I could watch the 
street pass below. On one rainy day, I drove into a flooded intersection and 
watched the water burble through the hole, puddling at my feet. But the car 
didn't stall. 
</P>
<P>
 The car had an inglorious end -- knocked 100 feet north after I had left it on 
the freeway shoulder after running out of gas. The hit-and-run driver had given 
me a Datsun Accordion. But at least Dad collected $396 on the insurance -- 
which, come to think of it, he kept. In the end, that birthday present cost him 
$4. 
</P>
<P>
 At 23, I severed the automotive umbilical cord. My first real, full-time job 
required a real, full-time car. But the size of my paychecks and sticker shock 
pointed me to Toyota's cheapest Tercel. I drove this little red tin can like a 
sports car and still got almost 40 miles per gallon -- until the first tuneup. 
And then I met a young woman who drove her folks' old Country Squire station 
wagon -- a symbol of solid family values. Life was good. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't last. The Country Squire-ette disappeared. Self-destructive 
tendencies revealed themselves in my neglect of the Tercel. It started to 
guzzle oil. And eventually, to quote the mechanic, "it threw a rod." 
</P>
<P>
 I was towed to the closest dealership. My choice was expensive surgery to an 
engine with 77,000 miles, towing the car elsewhere, or buying a used car on the 
spot. I chose a brown Mazda 626 with an odometer reading of almost 50,000 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, I can see that this was a transitional car, perhaps a 
therapeutic car. Never did I equate the Mazda with myself. I didn't choose it; 
the fates forced it upon me. But this time, at least, the fates were fair and 
functional. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mazda was decent to me, though it never had a garage. In time the sun 
burned a streak down the middle of its roof, which made it look vaguely like a 
skunk. The upholstery started to fray; the odometer stuck. I have no idea how 
much mileage it had racked up when the engine died. For $300 I sold it to my 
friend Lita, who knew a mechanic. He worked such wonders that Lita eventually 
drove that Mazda home to Guatemala. Her father still drives it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but the Mustang. Having just turned 30, I was determined to treat myself 
to a red convertible. And the Mustang, I thought, was me , with the wind in my 
thinning hair. Fun. Sporty. Not too macho. (We're not talking a muscular 
5.0-liter engine here. Insurance costs put the brakes on that idea.) 
</P>
<P>
 It mattered little that this Mustang once was a birthday gift to a 16-year-old 
girl from Alaska who had a rather successful and generous daddy. She was a 
19-year-old USC freshwoman ( co-ed being a slur these days) when I bought the 
car. There are few better examples of trickle-down economics than my Mustang 
and my old Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the Mustang was great. I would put the top down and drive through 
Topanga out to Malibu. But putting the top down on a hot day in a traffic jam 
offered no relief. In Alaska they don't need a/c. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Mustang is looking more like an albatross. A valve job six months 
ago cost $800. The radio stopped working, and it needs a new top and two new 
hubcaps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so I sat before Fred, trying to whittle away at the price of the Maxima, 
envisioning the cool comfort that could be mine. It would be my first really 
nice car. It would be my first car with power windows. Driving it made me feel 
like I should be wearing my best suit, with a fresh polish on my shoes. And 
that, it occurred to me, was part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is," Fred said, "do you want the car or don't you? You've been 
back here three times. I think you want the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the summer I worked as a "lot boy" at a dealership and hated 
taking orders from salesmen and the manager. Maybe I just decided the Maxima 
wasn't me.  
</P>
<P>
 I walked. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was 97 degrees in Van Nuys the other day. So maybe I'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, as Freud might say, sometimes a car is just a car.

TOOTH AND CONSEQUENCES; CLINIC AT SANTA ANA'S ROOSEVELT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
OFFERS CHILDREN FREE DENTAL CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was 12-year-old Diana Araujo's first visit to a dentist, and she was less 
than thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the 250 mostly low-income children who showed up for free dental 
care offered at a one-day clinic Saturday, Diana had never seen a dentist. The 
child, it turned out, needed to have a molar removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it's over," she mumbled later, puffy-eyed from crying. Nevertheless, 
she said, the experience had not been as bad as she thought it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Four volunteer dentists offered an estimated $25,000 worth of care at the 
clinic, held at Roosevelt Elementary School, providing fillings and more minor 
dental work to children from second through fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Families began arriving before 7 a.m., half an hour before the clinic opened, 
volunteers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents were happy that we can offer this care for their children," volunteer 
Addie Ceja said. "Parents were here since before 7, lined up and waiting to get 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Harris Done, one of the volunteer dentists, has traveled to Central 
America to provide no-cost dental care for the past 26 years. He said he was 
surprised how many children in Santa Ana had never seen a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two (areas) are almost identical," he said, comparing his experiences. 
"What's so chilling is to see a piece of Central America in Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
 As the children awaited dental work, their parents received instruction on 
nutrition and good dental habits. All were given toothbrushes to take home to 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
 When the children arrived for their appointments, they were taken into a 
screening room where a dentist assessed their problems and directed them to one 
of three areas -- numbing, sealants or check-out. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the numbing room, children watched movies and waited until it was 
their turn for a shot of Novocain. Most children took the shot well, but some 
began to cry and shake. One child, Isreal Arias, said a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have been wonderful," Done said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Soto, a 9-year-old who had two cavities filled, said she wasn't 
nervous about seeing a dentist for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just crossing my fingers through it," she said.

 Worse Than Caning: Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) was all in a froth 
the other day over the appearance of former President Reagan's daughter, Patti 
Davis, in the pages of this month's Playboy magazine wearing nothing but a 
suntan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, a staunch Reagan loyalist, was waving around the nude photographs of 
Davis and making a tizzy about it to anyone who would listen. The irascible 
congressman wondered aloud why Davis would do such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she's doing is, she's caning her parents," Dornan groused, "and caning 
your parents in their head and heart is worse than on the behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Most galling of all, Dornan sighed, was that Davis posed with Hugh Hefner's 
dog. 
</P>

 Big Bucks: With the appearance of mega-millionaires like Ross Perot and 
Michael Huffington on the political scene, much has been made of the effect of 
personal wealth on politics. But if last Tuesday's primary election proved 
anything, it's that money can't buy political love in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Haydee V. Tillotson finished third in the race for a county supervisor's seat 
after loaning her campaign $342,000. Tillotson spent $19.35 a vote in a losing 
cause, the equivalent of a nice meal for three at Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied Business PAC, the group of wealthy Christian business leaders who have 
bankrolled numerous conservative candidates and causes during the past three 
years, forked over nearly $160,000 to Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond, who 
finished third in the GOP primary in the 70th Assembly District. Allied spent 
$12.35 for each vote Hammond got. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Here Comes the Judge: Attorney Thomas G. Reinecke, who ran in the 70th 
Assembly District's GOP primary, is facing behind-the-scenes criticism from 
fellow attorneys that he has been improperly using his credentials as judge pro 
tem. 
</P>
<P>
 A few have pointed out in letters to Superior Court Judge Donald E. Smallwood 
that Reinecke uses the title in his Yellow Pages ad and has included a picture 
of himself on the bench in campaign literature. As presiding judge last year, 
Smallwood authored a policy prohibiting such things. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke said he was not aware of the policy, but he said the state 
Legislature has sanctioned the use of the title in political materials, and 
that he checked with the Municipal Court in Newport Beach's lead judge before 
doing so. "Those attorneys are incorrect," he said. "I am a judge pro tem and 
proud to be one and I will continue to be a judge pro tem."

 Bad News Bears: If they were a baseball team, the Republican Majority 
Coalition would be the cellar dweller in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the squad of moderate Republicans sought to put 21 new faces on the 
conservative-dominated Orange County Republican Central Committee, only three 
got elected last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big push failed," crowed Matthew Cunningham, a conservative who didn't 
let the loss of his own central committee seat dampen his delight. "It's just 
another unsuccessful salvo in the liberal jihad."

<P>
 A Morrissey by Any Other Name: Jim Morrissey, the Republican candidate for the 
69th Assembly District, wasn't the only Jim Morrissey to show up at the 
candidate's Santa Ana campaign headquarters on election night. 
</P>
<P>
 Several men named Jim Morrissey called up the Morrissey campaign office to ask 
about their namesake. One stopped by the candidate's Santa Ana headquarters to 
pick up a political sign for his desk. Another drove from the northern reaches 
of the county to participate in the Morrissey celebratory party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morrisseys are just coming out of the woodwork," said Tom Morrissey, of Buena 
Park, the older brother of Jim (yes, the candidate) Morrissey. "We're very 
prolific."

 Electrical Voting: One voter last Tuesday was willing to go to the extreme to 
vote -- anywhere, that is, except his neighborhood polling place. The voter 
called county officials, complaining that he was afraid to cast his ballot 
because of a high-voltage line above his polling station. He was given 
directions to the registrar of voters office in Santa Ana so that he could vote 
there.

 Orange County politicians saw their public stock rise or fall after Tuesday's 
primary election. Here's our insider assessment of who's up, who's down -- and 
who's out of business.

TRAIN DECAPITATES BOY ON TRESTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 11-year-old boy who was fishing with companions off a railroad bridge in 
Pico Rivera was decapitated by a passing freight train Saturday as he tried to 
race to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,600-foot-long freight had come out of a sharp curve near Whittier 
Boulevard about 1:40 p.m. and was about to cross the bridge over the San 
Gabriel River when the engineer spotted the six youngsters on the trestle. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroad man was unable to stop the train and frantically blew his air 
horn to warn the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five of the kids hung off the side of the bridge," Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Merrill 
said, "but the 11-year-old took off running and didn't quite make it to the end 
of the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the boy was withheld pending notice of next of kin.

FUND-RAISER HELD FOR TEEN WITH LEUKEMIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephanie Gorman, who lost a leg to leukemia, is dreaming of a summer filled 
with horseback riding and in-line skating. 
</P>
<P>
 To help make this dream possible, the Westminster Elks Club held a 
fund-raising barbecue and dance on Saturday to help the 17-year-old buy a 
flexible artificial leg that will enable her to participate in the athletic 
activities that she loves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leg will help me to do things that I wouldn't be able to do, things that 
I used to do before I lost my leg," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorman's leg was amputated in December, 1992, after a yearlong battle with 
leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster Elks Lodge, of which Gorman's grandfather, Don Grous, is an 
associate member, has raised more than $23,000 so far in a series of 
fund-raisers that they began holding after the teen-ager lost her leg, lodge 
member Steve Stockett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's event added another $1,085 to help the teen-ager, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorman's first artificial leg cost $27,000, an amount that was only 50% 
covered by insurance. The organization raised money to help pay for that leg 
and are now trying to finance a second leg. 
</P>
<P>
 While the artificial leg she has now enables Gorman to walk, it is not 
flexible enough for athletic activity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockett called the teen-ager courageous and praised her for keeping a 
positive attitude, despite the hardships she has faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorman said the support of the lodge members, who she said she has grown very 
close to over the last year, has helped her remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all of the big causes out there, I'm amazed that they would take the 
time to help me," Gorman said of the Elks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really thankful."

BRIDGE WORK TO AFFECT 3 FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation announced closures of several 
freeways in Orange County in the coming week so construction crews can begin 
demolishing bridges that will give way to new interchanges for three key 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials said the nightly closures are necessary so 
construction crews can demolish bridges that serve as interchanges for the 
Santa Ana, Garden Grove and Orange freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 All northbound lanes of the Santa Ana Freeway will be closed at the Main 
Street exit for five hours nightly beginning Tuesday and ending Friday. The 
closure will be in effect between midnight and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The connector from the northbound Santa Ana Freeway to the northbound Orange 
Freeway also will be closed between midnight and 5 a.m. on Tuesday and 
Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the southbound lanes of the Santa Ana Freeway also will be 
closed nightly during the same hours at The City Drive between today and 
Friday. The closure will be repeated next week between June 19 and June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans said the closure at The City Drive exit is necessary to demolish the 
bridge that serves as the interchange for the Santa Ana and Orange freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists will be guided to alternate routes by detour signs, said 
transportation officials.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family and friends of a woman slain in Orange last month have established 
a scholarship fund in her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Leanora Annette Wong, 23, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death May 20 
outside the Australian Beach Restaurant & Nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 A convicted sex offender, Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., 28, was arrested several 
days later and now faces the possibility of the death sentence if convicted of 
killing the UC Riverside graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund is a "living memorial scholarship for other young women who value 
education and have given of themselves to their family, school and community," 
according to a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong's memory "will live on in other young women who graduate from Ramona High 
School and continue to higher education," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions to the Lea Wong Memorial Scholarship Fund should be sent to: 
Riverside Campus Federal Credit Union, 3595 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside, CA, 
92507-4697.

FILIPINOS SHARE THEIR CULTURE AT KNOTT'S FESTIVAL; CELEBRATION: THE EVENT 
CONTINUES TODAY WITH FOODS, MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT FROM THEIR NATIVE LAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Filipino Americans from throughout Southern California gathered at Knott's 
Berry Farm on Saturday to celebrate Philippine Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials said they expected about 25,000 Filipino Americans to visit the 
park over the weekend to join thousands of other visitors in celebrating a 
"fiesta Filipiniana." The two-day festival continues today and features 
Filipino food, music and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 For many young members of the Filipino American community, the celebration was 
a chance to share their culture with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends don't know much about us. Because many of us have Spanish names, 
they think we're Hispanic," said Rey Guintu, 19, from Carson. "And they don't 
understand why most people from the Philippines speak English." 
</P>
<P>
 Many young Filipino Americans identify themselves as "Fil-Ams," Guintu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival was billed as the 96th anniversary of Philippine independence, in 
recognition of June 12, 1898, when Filipinos declared their independence from 
Spain following the U.S. naval victory over the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Philippines continued to be governed as a colony of the United 
States until July 4, 1946, when it became an independent nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Americans don't know that Filipinos learned English in school," said 
Lily Gamboa, 20, who went to the festival with Guintu. "My grandparents lived 
in the Philippines and both of my parents were born there, and all of them 
learned English in school." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, sunny skies and warm temperatures complemented the ambience of 
the cultural activities. Park visitors sampled various traditional dishes, 
including the popular lumpias, and heard stories of legendary Filipino heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Burke said she drove from Monrovia with her three teen-age 
grandchildren to enjoy the festivities. She lived in the Philippines, where her 
father worked for an American manufacturing company, when she was a young girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't hear too much about the Filipino community. But Filipinos are 
hard-working, conscientious folks," Burke said. "They are one of the biggest 
ethnic groups in the state, but everybody, including the politicians, overlooks 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The event featured an entertainment troupe from Los Angeles called Kasaysayan 
Ng Lahi, which used dance and music to illustrate Filipino culture. The 
evening's highlight was a Santacruzan, a quasi-religious ceremony where young 
women dressed in traditional gowns and their escorts re-enact a ceremony giving 
thanks for a successful harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival is sponsored by the Southern California Filipino American 
community and the Philippine government's Department of Tourism.

SPRINGER HIT HARD, TIGERS JUICE ANGELS; BASEBALL: GIBSON HITS TWO OF DETROIT'S 
FOUR HOME RUNS, DRIVES IN SEVEN IN 11-5 ROUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sparky Anderson thinks "that . . . nitroglycerin ball" is ruining the game he 
loves. Russ Springer, with a considerably narrower view than the Detroit 
manager, thinks the purportedly juiced baseball helped ruin his 1994 debut with 
the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer had a 7-4 record with a 3.04 earned-run average and four complete 
games with triple-A Vancouver and had won his last five starts. But all that 
momentum went south when he came down to Anaheim and baseballs started 
rocketing into the seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers hit four home runs Saturday night -- two against Springer -- 
including a three-run shot by Kirk Gibson off reliever Craig Lefferts with two 
runners who belonged to Springer on base and a grand slam by Gibson in the 
ninth en route to an 11-5 rout of the Angels in front of 25,713 at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit, which leads the majors with 91 homers, has hit at least one home run 
in 18 consecutive games and has scored seven or more runs in eight of 11 games 
this month. The Tigers also have won 10 of their last 12. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is Anderson complaining? 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball was made for all the teams, not just one or a few with power," he 
said. "It doesn't matter what Ken Griffey Jr. does, it matters what happens to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That thing is a rocket. I guarantee you it isn't the same ball we used in the 
'60s, no matter what they say. It's wound so tight, I swear one of them is 
going to jump out of the park on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The object is to sell memorabilia, to sell home runs. They say it's exciting, 
but what are they going to do at the end of the season when you have eight or 
10 guys hitting more than 40 homers?" 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just the long ball that soured Springer's return to the major 
leagues, however. He gave up nine hits and six runs in 4 1/3 innings but 
back-to-back homers by Mickey Tettleton and former Angel Junior Felix in the 
second and Gibson's shot in a four-run fifth were the death blows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw the ball pretty much where I wanted to," Springer said. "I feel like 
I can win here, I feel like I belong. When you lose, you lose, but you can 
still take some good things out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tettleton hit a low outside fastball and Felix hit a low curve ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson finished off the Angels with a towering shot into the right field seats 
off Mike Butcher, who had walked Travis Fryman and Cecil Fielder to load the 
bases after Bob Patterson gave up a double to Lou Whitaker, his third. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third grand slam of Gibson's career and his second against the 
Angels. The seven runs batted in were a career high. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, in desperate need of some solid starting pitching, might have 
thought their savior had arrived when Springer struck out the side after giving 
up a single to Tony Phillips in the first. He struck out five during his brief 
stint and gave up just one walk, but he gave up too many line drives and ended 
up looking far too much like the pitcher who was 0-2 with a 14.34 ERA during 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had good arm strength and a good fastball," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. 
"That was a good start, but the thing about pitching against a team like this, 
you'll have to get those guys again. And you can't get them the same way. 
They'll adjust." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger starter Tim Belcher (5-8), who gave up a bases-empty homer to Tim Salmon 
in the first inning, did not allow another hit until the fifth when the Angels 
scored twice because the former Dodger forgot how to count to three. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three batters in the inning singled to load the bases, but Belcher 
got Rod Correia on a shallow fly to center. Spike Owen slapped a 
ready-made-double-play one-hopper right at Belcher, who didn't throw home or to 
second but instead lobbed to first for the second out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Curtis drove in a run with a roller to third but Belcher struck out 
Salmon to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels loaded the bases on a walk and two singles in the seventh and 
Anderson brought in Joe Boever, who struck out Curtis and Salmon and then 
yielded a two-run bloop single to left by Chili Davis.

'HE'D HATE ME IF I STOPPED MY LIFE'; VOLLEYBALL STANDOUT NINA FOSTER PRESSES ON 
AS FATHER LIES IN COMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was a sight no child should ever have to wake up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the morning on May 10, Nina Foster wandered into the kitchen of the 
Mission Viejo apartment and found her father collapsed on the floor. Clayton 
Foster, 42, who had raised his daughter alone, had suffered his second stroke 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina's instincts took over. First, survival. Nina dialed 911. Second, support. 
She phoned her best friend Analisa Saylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics took Clayton Foster and his daughter to Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo. While doctors treated Clayton, Saylor and her 
mother, Marge Wilson, waited at the hospital with Nina. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating, thinking about some things you wanted to say that you 
never got to," Foster said. "My dad and I had a really good relationship. It 
was always just me and him against the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The night before he collapsed, we were joking around, and I was kidding him 
about some things. He told me, 'See how you treat me?' We laughed, but you wish 
that you had more time." 
</P>
<P>
 Life hasn't been easy for Nina Foster and her father, but she has found 
strength within herself and support from her closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nina went through a hard time when Clayton had the first stroke three years 
ago," Wilson said. "He was out of money, out of a job. Nina wanted to stay at 
Mission Viejo High, so in her sophomore year, we took her in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've kind of adopted her and took her under my wing. She's part of my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Nina is staying with Wilson now, as she did three years ago when Clayton was 
hospitalized after his first stroke.  
</P>
<P>
 Clayton always encouraged his daughter to stick with her studies so she could 
go to college. And Clayton and Nina's surrogate family watched her fulfill 
those dreams when she earned a scholarship to play volleyball for the same 
school Clayton attended, Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Things began to look even better for the Fosters in early May. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton cheered for his daughter, a standout in four track and field events at 
Mission Viejo, as she won the South Coast League championship in the discus, 
triple jump and shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clayton had been out of work since October," said Fred Almond, Mission Viejo 
girls' track and field coach. "But he finally got a job in San Pedro, only 
about 10 days before it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wilson, Clayton Foster suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and 
extensive brain damage. He is in a coma and on kidney dialysis in the intensive 
care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is in grave condition, but that doesn't mean he can't recover," Foster 
said. "Sometimes he will move his head toward the person who is talking to him. 
He just does little things every day." 
</P>
<P>
 No one would have blamed Nina Foster if she had dropped everything to be with 
her father. She still visits him every day, but she has continued with her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nina is the kind of young lady who doesn't look back, she just looks 
forward," Almond said. "She has to take care of her father and she knows that. 
But she knows he wants her to go to Alabama and establish a foundation for her 
own life." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her father's health, there are other concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if Nina will inherit her father's financial debts once she turns 
18 in July," Wilson said. "There are a lot of people who could make that 
unpleasant for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've also discussed what she wants to do with all of her father's 
belongings, where he will be buried, those kinds of things. If he is in a coma 
indefinitely, Nina wants him sent to Alabama where his two brothers and one 
sister live." 
</P>
<P>
 Heady issues for a 17-year-old trying to graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Foster: "It's obvious what my dad would want me to do. He would be so mad 
if I just quit on it, and he'd hate me if I stopped my life. You have to know 
him to understand how much he would have wanted me to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton Foster first encouraged Nina to try out for volleyball when she was in 
eighth grade. Even then, Foster stood out from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I showed up for club tryouts wearing red elbow pads and knee pads," Foster 
said. "Of course, volleyball players don't wear elbow pads. I was so 
embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster struggled with the sport, playing in only one game as a sophomore with 
the Mission Viejo junior varsity. But she has stayed with it and blossomed 
before her junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster credits the improvement to her involvement in club volleyball, where 
she first met Saylor. The pair have played together for the Mission Valley club 
team for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even remember the first time I met her," Saylor said. "We're both 
really goofy, so we get along." 
</P>
<P>
 They got along so well that it was natural for Foster to move in with Saylor 
and her family when Clayton was hospitalized after each stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Saylor knows that she and her family can only lend their support to Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how some people who aren't that close to you can be overly 
sentimental? Well, I try to remain normal to Nina," Saylor said. "I stay strong 
for her, but I don't try to give her any answers because I don't know what she 
is going through. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told her how I would feel if something happened to my mom . . . Nina's 
been so strong; stronger than I would've been." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in four years, Foster will be without Saylor next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Each player earned a volleyball scholarship, but they will attend different 
schools -- Saylor is going to Colorado State.  
</P>
<P>
 Both players finished their high-school careers with stunning performances in 
the Orange County all-star match at Golden West College June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 With Saylor setting, Foster had 15 kills to earn MVP honors and lead the South 
to a three-game victory over the North. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-star match was just like a normal practice for Foster because many of 
her Mission Valley Blue club teammates were selected to the South squad.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Vetter of Dana Hills, Hilary Kyle of Laguna Beach and Leigh Readey of 
Irvine also joined Saylor and Foster on the all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 And on that night, Foster was the best of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Nina would've played like that against us, we wouldn't have beaten them 
twice this season," said South Coach Mike Hurlbut of Dana Hills, the South 
Coast League champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Foster and Saylor couldn't help Mission Viejo advance to the 
playoffs, they hope to lead Mission Valley Blue to national prominence.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Coach Mark Mednick, who also coaches at Irvine High, Mission 
Valley Blue is ranked No. 1 in the nation in the 18-and-under division. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Valley Blue is playing in the Orange County Invitational junior 
volleyball tournament this weekend, in its last tuneup for the season finale, 
the Volleyball Festival at UC Davis, June 27-July 1. Mission Valley Blue lost 
in the 18-and-under final last year.  
</P>
<P>
 "This team is determined to get back to the final and win it," Mednick said. 
"It's an extremely talented group and we're strong at every position." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the entry fees from the Orange County Invitational will go to a trust 
fund for Foster, said Charlie Brande, a longtime area coach who is sponsoring 
the tournament. Others in the volleyball community are also contributing on 
Foster's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brande, the Southern California region of the U.S. Volleyball 
Assn. is accepting donations for the trust fund. Brande and Dale Flickinger 
also sponsored another tournament this weekend. Brande hopes the 40-team field 
from that tournament will generate $4,000 for Foster's trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Almond: "Marge started the trust fund to help Nina with basics like 
feeding and clothing herself, expenses for college. Mission Viejo High is 
taking contributions and we're trying to help in any way we can. I'm just happy 
I could contribute in some way, but what I've done pales in comparison to 
Marge. She's been a guiding light for Nina." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilson: "Nina told me she's coming back for Christmas and the holidays. 
It's like having another kid but not planning on it, and that suits me fine."

CURSES! CANUCKS FOIL RANGERS AGAIN, 4-1; HOCKEY: VANCOUVER DOMINATES IN SCORING 
SECOND CONSECUTIVE VICTORY, SETTING UP GAME 7 TUESDAY IN NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pushed to the brink of the biggest collapse in hockey history, the New York 
Rangers are staring into an abyss of 54 years of Stanley Cup failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Given two chances to clinch their first triumph since 1940, the Rangers have 
failed twice and failed miserably. They were thoroughly outplayed in a 4-1 loss 
to the Canucks on Saturday at the Pacific Coliseum, leaving them one stumble 
away from becoming the second NHL team to squander a 3-1 lead in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're angry and disappointed," Ranger defenseman Brian Leetch said. 
</P>
<P>
 It has come to this, to one game on Tuesday at New York's Madison Square 
Garden, because the Rangers could not counter the Canucks' robust hitting and 
the pressure they exerted in the Rangers' defensive zone. It has come to this 
because the Canucks got the sharpest goaltending from Kirk McLean since the 
series opener, when he made 52 saves. McLean stopped 29 shots Saturday, 22 in 
the last two periods. 
</P>
<P>
 It has come to this because the Rangers, despite hundreds of games of 
collective playoff experience, lacked the poise and spirit the Canucks 
displayed before a roaring sellout crowd of 16,150. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to take it to them, and we did," Vancouver winger Sergio Momesso 
said. "We had to win Game 5, and we did. We came up with a big effort in their 
building because we had the motivation of coming home.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we've taken this where we wanted. Now that we're there, we've got to go 
and get it." 
</P>
<P>
 This will be only the seventh Game 7 in the finals since the best-of-seven 
format began in 1939. It is also the first since 1987, when current Ranger 
Coach Mike Keenan coached Philadelphia against Edmonton. He now coaches six 
players who were members of the Oilers that spring and defeated his Flyers, 
3-1, in Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those former Oilers is Mark Messier, who claimed he couldn't remember 
that far back. He's looking ahead to Tuesday. "It's been a long year," he said. 
"We fought hard for 84 games to have home-ice advantage and we have to make 
home ice pay dividends." 
</P>
<P>
 The only other team to take a 3-1 lead in the finals and lose was the 1942 
Toronto Maple Leafs, who were overtaken by the Detroit Red Wings. The Canucks 
have done it twice in the first round, this spring against Calgary and last 
spring against Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said we were in awe of (the Rangers) but we're a very confident hockey 
club," said defenseman Jeff Brown, who scored twice Saturday. "Even though we 
got down, 3-1, we always felt we could come back. We've just given ourselves 
another opportunity to do that. We're grateful for that." 
</P>
<P>
 They've also earned that chance, which even Keenan had to acknowledge. When he 
wasn't moaning that the officials have given the Canucks more power plays than 
the Rangers throughout the series, he conceded the Canucks have played more 
aggressively in the last two games than his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give them credit for their successes at this point. They had to 
win a huge game in New York, and they did, and they responded very well 
tonight," he said. "You work all season long for an advantage and hopefully, 
the advantage will come to us in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals in New York 
City." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks controlled the play in the first period Saturday but emerged with 
only a 1-0 lead. Brown gave them that on a power play at 9:42, when his shot 
from the left circle deflected off Ranger forward Esa Tikkanen and upward, 
surprising goalie Mike Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Courtnall made it 2-0, also on a deflection, off the stick of Ranger 
defenseman Doug Lidster at 12:29 of the second period. The Rangers made it 2-1 
on a power-play goal 2:13 later, when Alexei Kovalev's shot from the right 
circle glanced off Murray Craven's leg and between McLean's pads. That made 
them confident they could mount a third-period rally and carry the Cup home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we had done some things well and could play better," Richter said. 
"We still had a good chance of winning. It's a shame that third goal went in." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, by Brown, resulted when he intercepted a Ranger clearing pass and 
blasted a 40-foot shot from the right side at 8:35. "I really didn't get a good 
look at it," Richter said. "They were tossing it around pretty good in our 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Bill McCreary didn't see Courtnall's backhander zip under the crossbar 
and out of the net with 1:32 to go, and so allowed play to continue until a 
stoppage occurred and it could be reviewed. That stoppage arose when Messier 
tucked the puck inside the right post with 58 seconds to play. However, when 
replays showed Courtnall's shot clearly had gone in, the clock was moved back 
to the time he scored and Messier's goal was disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers didn't argue. They were saving their energy for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you sit here and think of the negatives, your mental state isn't going to 
help when you're preparing for the next game," Leetch said. "You have to put 
(mistakes) behind you and think of all the positives you did to get in this 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Canuck defenseman Gerald Diduck: "It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
Getting to the Stanley Cup final is one thing, but playing one game for the 
whole thing is going to be real neat." Back From the Brink 
</P>
<P>
 Teams that have come back from 3-0 and 3-1 deficits to win series in the 
Stanley Cup playoffs:

DODGER LOSS BEGS QUESTION ABOUT RELIEF; BASEBALL: BUT LASORDA HAS NO CLEAR 
ANSWER AFTER HERSHISER IS LEFT IN TO ENDURE CUB RALLY IN THE EIGHTH INNING OF 
7-4 CHICAGO VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 What happened in the clubhouse after the Dodgers' 7-4 loss to the Chicago Cubs 
on Saturday was far more indicative of the way this team's morale is eroding 
than what happened in the game, which once again they lost in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser, always affable in interviews even in the most dismal of times, 
dressed as quickly as possible, gave succinct but polite answers and ended the 
interview session by asking, "Is that it?" Then, not waiting for surprised 
reporters to answer, he walked out of the visitor's clubhouse at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he mad? No one needed to ask. Hershiser (3-3) won't criticize his 
teammates or management and last week abruptly ended an interview when he 
thought a reporter was trying to provoke him to do so. But the opposite has not 
been true. There have been grumblings this week that Hershiser, who took 
himself out of the game during his last start because his hip bothered him, has 
played too much golf on the trip and he was aware of the criticism. Yet, after 
being left in the game to crumble during the eighth inning, he explained his 
performance this way: "I was like a time bomb waiting to go off." 
</P>
<P>
 Why was Hershiser left in so long during the Cubs' six-hit, four-run eighth 
inning? He gave up two homers, a walk and a single before he was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know as much about it as I do," Manager Tom Lasorda said, when asked if 
he noticed Hershiser was tired. "He probably didn't make the right pitch, 
(pinch-hitter Kevin Roberson) hit it out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lasorda, when asked if he was leery about going to his bullpen, said: "Not 
necessarily. . . . (Hershiser) knows how he feels too. He was leading, 4-3." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser, when asked if he was surprised he was left in so long, said it's 
not his job to decide when he comes out. "I don't look over at the bullpen, I 
concentrate on the next hitter," he said. "If they don't let me pitch to the 
next hitter, then . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Cubs who were relieved, having finally ended a 10-game losing 
streak -- their worst since 1985 when they lost 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an easy thing to do, to go up there after sitting and swing at a 
good pitch," said Roberson, who has two pinch-hit homers this season. "You 
never know what could be the click for the team to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberson hit for starter Willie Banks (7-5) to lead off the eighth inning and 
hit Hershiser's first pitch into the right-center field seats to tie the score. 
A single and a double play later, Sammy Sosa hit another solo homer, putting 
the Cubs ahead, 5-4.  
</P>
<P>
 After Hershiser walked Derrick May, in came Al Osuna, who was shortly followed 
by Darren Dreifort. But there would be no relief. They combined to give up 
three more hits and two more runs. Randy Myers shut the Dodgers down in the 
ninth for his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I was fooling them," said Hershiser, who has gone eight innings 
only twice in 13 starts. "I just didn't pitch well. I didn't feel good the 
whole game. You never give into it, you just keep pitching. . . . (Pitching 
coach Ron) Perranoski was trying to help me during the game, and you saw how I 
got out of some of it. We had five double plays and three of them were 
line-drive double plays. I think there was only one hit on the ground. I was 
real fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Banks, the Dodgers scored two runs in the second inning on singles by 
Henry Rodriguez, Eric Karros and Garey Ingram, a bases-loaded walk to Hershiser 
and a groundout by Brett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 They went ahead, 4-2, in the fourth inning on a throwing error by Shawon 
Dunston and a single by Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Karros, who made some fine defensive plays, extended his hitting streak to a 
career-high 14 games and is batting .303. Raul Mondesi's streak ended at 14 
games.  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, often criticized for losing confidence in a reliever and not using 
him, has an entire bullpen that appears to have lost confidence. It has blown 
15 of 24 save opportunities, including three on the team's current trip, during 
which the Dodgers are 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is to blame? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at what happened (on the trip), how many saves have been blown?" 
Lasorda said.

HARPER'S BIZARRE TREK TO NEW YORK; NBA FINALS: LANGUISHING IN DALLAS, GUARD 
GETS CHANCE WITH KNICKS ONLY AFTER FRIEND'S INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was perhaps the only thing worse than being a Dallas Maverick. Being a 
Dallas Maverick with the tease of parole, a trade, always around. It was cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 That he was the one left to go down with the ship, while Rolando Blackman and 
Sam Perkins and Detlef Schrempf were on teams challenging for an NBA title, 
only compounded the anguish for Derek Harper. He was one of the most popular 
Mavericks ever and had enjoyed many great times there, but the implosion of the 
once-promising franchise left him aching to join the others who got out, even 
somewhat jealous of the June 1992 trade that had sent longtime backcourt mate 
Blackman to New York. The final days of his career were flying by as a 
32-year-old mentor on a team so deep in a youth movement that it would contend 
for the worst record in league history two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it came, after so much wishing. Doc Rivers suffered a season-ending knee 
injury and the Knicks, the same team that rescued Blackman, needed a new 
starting point guard, preferably a stable influence to offset backup Greg 
Anthony, who could play a much faster pace but too often as if on a perpetual 
sugar rush. Harper knew almost the instant he heard of Rivers' plight that this 
could be his opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had doubts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade was completed Jan. 6, with the Mavericks getting free-agent-to-be 
Tony Campbell because they wanted his salary slot in the summer and a future 
first-round pick. Harper couldn't have dreamed for more -- he got out of Dallas 
and landed on a team that would eventually play for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 His thank-yous haven't stopped since. The biggest came Friday night, when he 
made seven of 11 shots, including four of six three-pointers, to contribute 18 
points and seven assists to the Knicks' 91-83 victory in Houston that evened 
the best-of-seven series with the Rockets heading into Game 3 tonight at 
Madison Square Garden. At the same time, his defense hounded counterpart Kenny 
Smith into a second consecutive unspectacular showing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that in order to gain something good you have to go through a little 
transition, a little down, a little bad," Harper said. "And I went through a 
lot of bad my last two years, and this is what has come out of it. I think it 
was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fate said he would get this chance, for he and Rivers had always been linked, 
since the very beginning. They were born on the same day, after all, Oct. 13, 
1961. They met at a summer all-star camp in high school and then were compared 
as seniors in the rankings for the best guards in the country. They made a pact 
to attend the same college and might have both ended up at Michigan until 
Johnny Orr left as coach and Harper opted for Illinois and Rivers chose 
Marquette. They got the same agent, George Andrews, and watched the 1983 draft 
together, just the two of them alone in Andrews' apartment as he attended the 
proceedings in New York, living the excitement of Harper going No. 11 to Dallas 
and the disappointment of Rivers dropping into the second round before being 
picked by Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps it was inevitable that Harper's journey from the worst to one of 
the best would be tied to Rivers. The only bad part is that it came at the 
expense of Rivers, who, like Harper, waited his entire career for a chance to 
play in the finals and even came close once while with the Hawks. And now, when 
that opportunity should be there, after he had used that chance to counter the 
disappointment of leaving Los Angeles when traded by the Clippers, he is 
relegated to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivers participates only as a cheerleader. He doesn't go to many practices 
during the playoffs because he doesn't want to feel the buildup to the games, 
especially in the championship series, and then not be able to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his wife isn't watching the finals on television because it hurts her 
too much, and later she doesn't even want to talk about the games. The only 
comforting part has been the teammates who try to make him feel he had a hand 
in this, like Blackman's recent reminder that Rivers hit two-game winning shots 
during the 19 outings before the injury and that the Knicks might not have had 
home-court advantage in the playoffs against Chicago without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be a liar if I said winning a world championship will feel just like I 
thought it would," Rivers said. "But it won't. It will be nice if and when we 
win, but it won't be the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, meanwhile, is basking. 
</P>
<P>
 "After going through all of the things that I've gone through to get to this 
point, I definitely appreciate it," he said. "But I don't think appreciating it 
is going to be enough. The bottom line is to try to take full advantage of it 
by winning it all. We don't just want to be here. We are here and we're here to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are here, as in Madison Square Garden, with a chance to win the 
series at home. The Knicks are 9-1 there during the playoffs, but even coming 
back to play the next three games after stealing home-court advantage in 
Houston doesn't guarantee much. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other teams were in the same situation in the four previous finals, and 
both got swept at home to lose the title. It happened when the Trail Blazers 
split at Detroit in 1990 and then lost the next three in Portland, a feat 
duplicated the next year as the Bulls won all three games at the Forum after 
losing home-court advantage to the Lakers in Chicago.

 3. If Anthony Hopkins ain't in it, I don't go to a Victorian movie.

No man ever admits he's lost. A man will admit to murder before he'll admit

 28. How do you spell relief ? The Dodgers spell it H-e-l-p ! 
</P>
<P>
 I gotta go now. Sleep well, Jimmy. But I can hear you already: "Put in there 
that I don't like imitators!"

 Dan Barreiro of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis fondly recalls the many sports 
events at Chicago Stadium over the years -- even an NFL championship game in 
1932: 
</P>
<P>
 "(In 1932), the Chicago Bears beat the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans, 9-0, at 
Chicago Stadium. A blizzard made it impossible to play outdoors, so the game 
was moved (inside) and played on an 80-yard field." 
</P>
<P>
 The old stadium is scheduled to be demolished and replaced by the United 
Center across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "You build an arena in 1929 and you name it after a city," Barreiro writes. 
"You build an arena in 1994 and you name it after a sponsor." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the record for most assists in an NBA finals game? 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion statement: Ray Ratto writes in the San Francisco Examiner: 
</P>
<P>
 "Capsule reviews of the new baseball uniforms: Milwaukee, awful. Cleveland, 
perfectly horrid. Texas, dull yet inoffensive. Detroit, straight out of the 
Chunichi Dragons discard pile. Chicago Cubs, an inexplicable rip-off of the 
Cuban national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickname -- N.E.: It was reported recently in this space that when Bill Van 
Landingham joined the San Francisco Giants he became the 13th player in major 
league history with 13 letters in his last name.  
</P>
<P>
 For total letters in a full name, it's difficult to beat a UCLA high jumper 
from Ceylon in the late 1950s and early '60s: 
</P>
<P>
 Nagalingam Ethirveerasingam. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflated: From the collectors' Sportslook magazine: "The recent Michael 
Jordan-dominated Upper Deck Authenticated catalogue has caused a bit of moaning 
and groaning around the hobby, as many dealers and collectors feel that the 
$299 price tag on Jordan baseballs is 'outrageous.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Especially since the price is about .099 higher than his minor league batting 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Thug era: Bryan Burwell of USA Today, yearning for the good old days of the 
NBA, writes: "Magic's Lakers are gone. Larry's Celtics are a wisp. Isiah's 
Pistons, Jordan's Bulls, Dr. J.'s 76ers are all distant memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's Gary Payton's Sonics. It's John Starks' Knicks. Uggh. That sends 
shivers down the spine of every basketball purist's sensibilities." 
</P>

COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; SOONER AND LATER, COCHELL GETS HIS CROWN, 13-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oklahoma got hot at the right time, and that was enough to give Coach Larry 
Cochell that elusive College World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Minor and Rick Gutierrez each drove in three runs Saturday in the 
Sooners' record-setting 13-5 victory over Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochell, the only coach to bring three schools to the NCAA tournament 
championship, had not finished higher than third with Oral Roberts and Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had seen us six weeks ago, we might not have been the best, but we 
played the best when we had to and won the national championship," Cochell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The run total was a record for a championship finale. A 16-hit assault, 
matching another title-game record, denied Georgia Tech's Danny Hall a spot in 
the record book. He had a chance to become the only coach to win a national 
title in his first year at a school. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma (50-17) entered the game as the hottest-hitting team in the nation 
and the Sooners didn't let up. Aric Thomas and Darvin Traylor had three hits 
each, and four others had two apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got hot when we needed to get hot, that's the key," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech (also 50-17) added to its misery with four errors, giving up five 
unearned runs in the fourth inning to break a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Three errors, a two-run single by M.J. Mariani, an RBI single by Thomas and a 
bases-loaded walk to Gutierrez sent starter Al Gogolin (12-3) to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez and Rich Hills had RBI singles in the seventh, the latter eclipsing 
the 12 runs scored by Minnesota in its championship game victory over Arizona 
in 1956. The hit total matched the CWS record for a finale, set by USC against 
Arizona in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma center fielder Chip Glass, who batted .389 with three home runs and 
several key defensive plays in the tournament, was voted the most valuable 
player.

MIKE DOWNEY: USING FANS IN BULLPEN MIGHT COOL LASORDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dodger Stadium has a popular promotion called "Think Blue" week. Another one 
begins Monday. It is big fun.  
</P>
<P>
 For some lucky customer, the Dodgers might have Fantasy Organist for a Night. 
Or maybe, Fantasy Bat Boy or Bat Girl for a Night. Or maybe, Fantasy 
Public-Address Announcer or even Fantasy Sportswriter for a Night. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I've got a new one:  
</P>
<P>
 Fantasy Relief Pitcher.  
</P>
<P>
 Say, fans! How would you like to pitch one inning of a real Dodger baseball 
game? Well, now you can! 
</P>
<P>
 Send your name, age and radar-gun velocity to:  
</P>
<P>
 Tommy (Save Me!) Lasorda c/o Comic Relief Dodger Stadium Los Angeles 90074  
</P>
<P>
 As you know, the Dodger manager is developing an ulcer the size of third base. 
Lasorda doesn't need a phone number for the bullpen. He needs 911.  
</P>
<P>
 That bullpen door creaks open, it's like "Tales From the Crypt." 
</P>
<P>
 Scary.  
</P>
<P>
 I know you loyal, blue-thinking Dodger fans have all been accused of leaving 
baseball games too early, but let me give you some unbelievably good advice:  
</P>
<P>
 Uh, don't.  
</P>
<P>
 Dodger games are like the NBA's. They don't get really interesting until the 
last two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of June now, the Dodger bullpen hasn't saved a thing, including 
Lasorda's sanity. Todd Worrell and rookie Darren Dreifort in particular have 
worked with the approximate effectiveness of veteran right-hander Jose Canseco. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Things got so crazy, the Dodgers sent for Ismael Valdes, a pitcher who is only 
20 years old and so new to baseball he will need to introduce himself to 
everybody. "Call me Ismael," he'll say.  
</P>
<P>
 Too bad they didn't try him Saturday. Lasorda stayed too long with Orel 
Hershiser in the eighth inning, undoubtedly because he was reluctant to use the 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the manager has had a minor mutiny on his hands.  
</P>
<P>
 First, it was shortstop Jose O-fer-4 Offerman, who was so infuriated by being 
asked to sacrifice bunt with the pitcher on deck that he came back and threw 
everything he could lay his hands on, except Lasorda's parakeets.  
</P>
<P>
 Tommy had to chase Jose down a runway.  
</P>
<P>
 Next, it was Worrell and evidently catcher/co-conspirator Mike Piazza who 
ignored Lasorda's orders to hold Florida's Chuck Carr close to first base. Carr 
stole second, scored the game-winning run on a single and cackled that the 
Marlins know the secret to beating the Dodgers "if you can get to their 
bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
 The same strategy the Marlins have been using throughout their long and 
glorious baseball history.  
</P>
<P>
 When Worrell said he needed to concentrate more on the batter, Lasorda, in 
three words a player hates to hear a manager utter, said:  
</P>
<P>
 "He said what ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like a marlin, Tommy was fit to be tied.  
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, it seems Dodger starter Pedro Astacio was so displeased about 
being lifted for a reliever he later told a Spanish-speaking reporter he didn't 
understand "the mentality of the old man" (Lasorda) because he wanted to finish 
the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda evidently gave the whole team a piece of his mentality after the game. 
It reportedly could be heard throughout Ft. Lauderdale and in portions of West 
Palm Beach and Boca Raton.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, good news.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez and Kevin Gross came through with complete games. Tom Candiotti 
volunteered to do emergency mop-up. Pitchers pitched in to help. Everybody 
thought blue.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, you can too.  
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth inning, when pitching coach Ron Perranoski comes out of the 
dugout, don't just sit there. Wave your right arm. Volunteer.

WORLD CUP '94: 5 DAYS AND COUNTING; THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD; GREATER STAKES, 
STRICTER EMPHASIS ON RULES INTERPRETATION HAVE PLACED A HEAVIER BURDEN ON CUP 
REFEREES THAN EVER BEFORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was, without question, the most blatant piece of cheating in the history of 
international soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the referee missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The strange thing is, the incident need never have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 If Argentina's Diego Maradona had been a sportsman, he would not have punched 
the ball into the net with his fist and later claimed it was "the hand of God." 
</P>
<P>
 And if English soccer officials had not been so closed-minded, they would not 
have objected to having a Brazilian referee officiate England's 1986 World Cup 
quarterfinal match against Argentina in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maradona is not a sportsman. A once-gifted athlete, yes, but not a 
sportsman. And English soccer officials are notoriously insular. They feared a 
Brazilian would favor the Argentines, as fellow South Americans, and so Ali Ben 
Naceur of Tunisia was assigned by FIFA to referee the match. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair to Ben Naceur, not many in the crowd of 114,580 at Azteca Stadium 
saw the foul. England goalkeeper Peter Shilton and Maradona both leaped to 
reach a high ball -- Shilton to punch it away and Maradona to head it into the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona got there first, but as Shilton and the English defenders immediately 
insisted and as television replays later confirmed, the Argentine captain used 
his clenched right fist to drive the ball into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite English protests, the goal stood and Argentina went on to win the 
game, 2-1, and eventually the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Pele, commenting on the affair later, said: "It is certain that if the 
Argentines or Uruguayans had been in the same position as the English, they 
would have trampled the referee." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, all that happened to Ben Naceur was that he entered the World Cup 
history books as the official who blew the call. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the nightmare scenario that haunts all 24 referees selected to officiate 
this summer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 There seldom has been a World Cup entirely free of refereeing controversy, and 
the problems faced by "the men in black" have ranged from the frightening to 
the absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in the first World Cup, in Uruguay in 1930, police had to rush 
onto the field to separate players when fighting broke out between Argentina 
and Chile. In another game, between Romania and Peru, play became so violent 
that Chilean referee Alberto Warken was forced to eject Mario De Las Casas, 
Peru's captain. De Las Casas thus gained the unwanted distinction of becoming 
the first player to be thrown out of a World Cup game. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the championship match that year was not free of controversy, and Belgian 
referee Jean Langenus had to cope with the ludicrous demands by both the 
Uruguayans and Argentines that the ball used in the final come from their 
country. To solve the dilemma, a different ball was used in each half. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's referees have to be ready to deal with far more difficult problems. As 
the game has grown, so too have the pressures. Much more is at stake for the 
teams and the players; the prestige of winning is the same, but the financial 
rewards are incomparably greater. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, there is more gamesmanship involved. Perhaps cheating would be a 
better word. Players feign injury to waste time or to get an opponent in 
trouble. Players take dives in the penalty area in the hope of drawing a 
penalty kick. Players use their hands illegally. They hold, they push, they 
spit, they fight. 
</P>
<P>
 One graphic illustration of how the sport has changed can be seen in the 
number of penalty kicks awarded in World Cup play. There were 55 in the first 
10 tournaments between 1930 and 1974. But in the four since, 58 have been 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all this, today's game is played at a far greater speed than in 
years past. The players are better prepared and are perhaps fitter than their 
counterparts from the past, because of better training methods and better 
diets. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which means the referees, who sometimes are twice the age of the 
players, have to be fitter too. And more alert. 
</P>
<P>
 Belatedly, FIFA has recognized this and is acting to rid referees of the 
stereotyped image of being out of shape and out of touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the men in the middle, as they are known, have always been the 
targets of criticism, some of it justified. But now they are subjected to far 
more second-guessing than ever before. The eye of the television camera is 
everywhere, and instant replay, slow motion and videotaping give sportswriters 
and fans the opportunity to dissect every play. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA is trying to standardize refereeing, at least at the highest level in 
world and continental championships, but it is no small challenge. Rules are 
rules, but their interpretation varies. European referees, for example, allow a 
greater degree of physical contact, that is to say, stronger tackles and 
shoulder charges, than their South American counterparts. Other differences 
also exist. 
</P>
<P>
 On the soccer field, the referee is both judge and jury. His decision is what 
matters. He has two linesmen but they only make calls on offside and 
out-of-bounds plays, and even those calls can be overruled. 
</P>
<P>
 What might appear from the stands to be a clear foul is not necessarily what 
the referee sees. He has a different angle and might invoke the advantage rule 
or spot another infraction unseen by more distant viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven most important words in the rules of soccer, it has been pointed 
out, are these: "If in the opinion of the referee . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 No one else's opinion matters; the referee has total control. 
</P>
<P>
 During the most recent World Cup, in Italy in 1990, referees received more 
criticism than perhaps ever before. Unfortunately, much of it was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 The referees had been ordered by FIFA President Joao Havelange to crack down 
on violent play, under threat of being sent home if they did not. The result 
was chaos. Some referees punished the most innocuous of fouls, others ignored 
blatant fouls. Communication between referees and their linesmen was poor. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the tournament, a record 170 yellow cards had been issued and 16 
players had been tossed out of games, including Argentina's Pedro Monzon and 
Gustavo Dezotti, who became the first players to be red-carded in the 
championship final. 
</P>
<P>
 The abiding image of Italia '90, at least from the officiating standpoint, is 
of referee Edgardo Codesal Mendez of Mexico being surrounded and jostled by 
angry Argentine players, including Maradona, who did or said enough to be given 
a yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not an image FIFA is proud of, and world soccer's governing body has set 
out to change it in this summer's tournament. Here are some of the changes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The maximum age of the participating referees has been fixed at 45, with 
the intention of lowering it in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Instead of using referees as linesmen, this World Cup will be officiated by 
24 referees and 24 specialist linesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The "man-in-black" phrase is no longer applicable. Instead of wearing 
all-black uniforms, referees will be sporting fuchsia, silver or yellow shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are fairly conservative but more attractive than the traditional black 
jerseys," said Scotland's David Will, chairman of FIFA's referees committee. 
"The image of referees is gradually changing, and we think this is part of the 
modernization of the image." 
</P>
<P>
 -- All referees and linesmen will be based in Dallas during the tournament and 
will travel to matches in teams of four, grouped according to language 
compatibility when possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may rest assured that we will see better control of matches in 1994," 
Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, FIFA's general secretary, said last December in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter, who is from Switzerland, visited the United States again last March 
when all of the referees underwent a series of physical and written tests and 
attended seminars on rules interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very precise instructions have been given, principally about changes in 
emphasis," Will said. "We talked about changes in the psychological approach of 
referees and linesmen to soccer so that, hopefully, in the World Cup we shall 
see attacking soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried, by changing the psychology of the referees, to take away the 
advantage from defenders and give it to the forwards." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new interpretations of the rules will be to consider tackles from 
behind as serious fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is serious foul play, it is automatically an expulsion," Blatter said. 
"If there is a tackle from behind, it must be a red card. It cannot be a yellow 
card." 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow cards, or cautions, also will be given to players who fake being fouled 
by taking a dive, Blatter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether all these changes will result in more open and attacking play, rather 
than the defensive doldrums that characterized the 1990 tournament, remains to 
be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 An effort has been made but it will still be up to the referees to make the 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man in black will not be in black any longer," Blatter said, "but he will 
still be in charge." World Cup Referees

WORLD CUP '94; TEMPLE CITY'S ANGELES OUTSTANDING IN HIS FIELD; OFFICIATING: 
FORTY-YEAR-OLD CIVIL ENGINEER IS THE LONE AMERICAN CHOSEN AMONG THE 
TOURNAMENT'S 48 REFEREES AND LINESMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how the United States does in the World Cup, there is at least one 
American assured of being around on the field for the latter stages of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Angeles is a 40-year-old civil engineer from Temple City who is the 
only U.S. referee among the 48 referees and linesmen selected to officiate the 
52 World Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
 For Angeles, who was born in Mexico City and works for the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power, it is an honor many believe is well-deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not go far as a player, appearing as a goalkeeper for USC, where he 
earned his engineering degree, and for a club team, Nacional, in the local 
Abraham Lincoln Soccer League. As a referee, however, he has gone all the way 
to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Angeles began refereeing games in 1973, gradually working his way up through 
the youth, high school and college ranks in Southern California until he had 
earned a reputation as an honest official who knew the rules and applied them 
fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, after the World Cup in Italy, he was one of 80 referees from around 
the world who were placed on a list by FIFA, world soccer's governing body, and 
monitored regularly in top-class competition until last August. 
</P>
<P>
 The list was pared to 30 and then, after a rigorous series of physical and 
written tests in Dallas last March, to the 24 referees who will be in charge 
during World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 For a referee, except for being selected to officiate the World Cup final, it 
is the highest honor attainable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very happy (about being chosen)," Angeles said. "That's every 
referee's dream. I feel a great responsibility. I need to work hard and train 
hard to be ready. I'm very excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Living in a country where soccer is not as appreciated as elsewhere -- and is 
therefore not as well covered by the media -- Angeles has gone out of his way 
to make sure he keeps up on the international game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read La Opinion and I buy newspapers from Mexico," 
</P>
<P>
 he said. "And then, of course, I have a satellite dish. The only reason I 
bought it was so I can see soccer games. I also get videotapes from friends 
(overseas)." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Angeles when he was awarded his FIFA badge, enabling him to referee any 
international game in the world, and he can tell you the exact date. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got it on Jan. 1, 1988," he said without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Angeles has traveled widely and officiated some significant 
matches, obviously catching the eye of FIFA with his performances. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he was chosen to go to Saudi Arabia to referee at the 1989 World 
Under-20 championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 Olympic Games at Barcelona, he was the referee for the South 
Korea-Morocco match, as well as the prestigious Spain-Qatar game in front of a 
sellout crowd at Luis Casanova Stadium in Valencia. Spain won, 2-0, and went on 
to win the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latter game, Angeles handed out seven yellow cards and ejected one 
Qatari player. No doubt his strict management of the match was noted by FIFA, 
which wants its referees to be in unquestioned control. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer was a busy one for Angeles. He was the man in the middle for the 
extraordinary Germany-Brazil match at U.S. Cup '93 in Washington. The 
Brazilians scored three goals in the first half, and the Germans scored three 
in the second to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
 Angeles then traveled to Ecuador to officiate at the Copa America, or South 
American championship. He was assigned only one game but it was a good one -- 
defending champion Argentina versus Bolivia, both World Cup '94 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very rewarding experience (refereeing in the Copa America)," Angeles 
said, "I learned a lot because the South Americans are a little bit ahead of 
CONCACAF (the North and Central American and Caribbean region) in terms of 
playing. They have more skills and technique and tricks and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
 The chance to witness those skills up close and to control the play is what 
attracted Angeles to refereeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the challenge that you have to be right all the time," he said, "and 
the idea that you have to allow the players to play in such a way that you are 
there but yet they don't know you are there. That's difficult to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, to officiate in a manner that keeps the game flowing with as 
little interruption as possible and yet control with a firm hand. It's a 
delicate balance, one successfully achieved by only a few top referees. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Arturo Angeles, World Cup referee, can count himself among that number.

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; FOR AN OPEN AT OAKMONT, THEY STILL NEED PALMER WHEN HE'S 64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golf gets what might be one of its last looks at one of its most important 
figures in a major tournament at this week's U.S. Open, which Arnold Palmer is 
entering for the 32nd and final time. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, 64, is playing at Oakmont Country Club near Pittsburgh, which ought to 
help him if home-course advantage means anything. Palmer, from nearby Latrobe, 
Pa., has been a member at Oakmont for more than 30 years and has played at 
Oakmont since his teens. 
</P>
<P>
 He counts only one U.S. Open title among his triumphs, but he could have won 
twice more at Oakmont -- in 1962 when he lost in a playoff to Jack Nicklaus and 
in 1973 when he fell victim to Johnny Miller's closing-round 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer clearly remembers both times he missed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, the thing that lost the (1962) Open for me there was putting," 
Palmer said. "I three-putted 13 times and Nicklaus three-putted none. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would have thought that would have worked a little better for me at 
Oakmont, where I was raised, really. So you know, it was just one of those 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1973, I didn't even know Johnny Miller was playing until about the 11th 
green and I saw a scoreboard and he was in the process of shooting a 63. I 
remember I hit a drive on the 12th hole immediately after I saw Miller's score. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hole I knew very well and knew how to play it. I hit it right down 
the left side where I intended to play it and the ball hit in the fairway. In 
all the years that I had played there, it always kicks right, but it kicked 
left into the rough. That was the kind of thing that happened a lot in the 
Open, whether it was me or a bad bounce or a bad putt." 
</P>
<P>
 How well his local knowledge of Oakmont will serve Palmer is unclear. In the 
1983 Open at Oakmont, Palmer tied for 59th. It was the last Open in which 
Palmer has played until now. His first was also at Oakmont, in 1953 when he was 
an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said he intends to be optimistic until proven otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly going in with the thought that if things work out, I can play 
well and do well," he said. "But on the other side of it, it's a place where I 
sort of started a career, so to speak, and I guess it's where everybody, 
including me, knows that it's the last time that I'll play in the Open." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Oakmont: The course was designed before they found a place to put it. 
Henry C. Fownes, who sold his steel company to industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 
1896, drew the layout on paper with Fownes' son, then set out to find the land 
on which to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Fownes located the acreage he was looking for in the borough of Oakmont, about 
15 miles from Pittsburgh. But he also found a big problem, according to Jim 
Finegan in the June issue of Golf magazine: too many trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to create a big, open layout like a British links course, so 
Townes had the trees cut down and in 1903 got what he wanted -- a bleak, barren 
and very long golf course: a par-80 that included eight par-five holes and one 
par-six. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were more than 200 bunkers. At one time, the bunkers numbered 350. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Armour, who won the first of Oakmont's six U.S. Opens, in 1927, called 
it a "cruel and treacherous playground." 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, Palmer played Oakmont when the trees were still short. But he 
said the pitch and speed of the greens haven't changed that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to watch it. The greens were always very fast and you had to 
play the undulations. That was the name of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you got where you thought you could take advantage of a golf course that 
might not be jumping up and biting everybody, that's just about the time it 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oakmont's rough is pretty bad. If you're in the rough and going for the 
greens and the golf course is the way it's supposed to be, there's not much 
chance you're going to keep it on the green. That'll be this year or any other 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Who has won the most U.S. Open titles? Answer: Willie Anderson, Bobby 
Jones, Ben Hogan and Nicklaus have each won four. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI II: Lee Janzen's fourth-place finish in the Kemper Open this month was his 
first in the top 10 since he won the 1993 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vision Quest: Asked what it meant to him to win $114,400 when he tied for 
second place in the Kemper Open, Bobby Wadkins said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it doesn't mean anything except that my wife can buy more Power 
Rangers stuff for our son." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vision Quest II: According to Larry Guest in the Orlando Sentinel, Scott Hoch 
thought he was having eye problems until an optometrist checked his contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Guest: "After discovering the lenses had been mistakenly buffed instead 
of just cleaned a few months ago, cloudy lenses were replaced with clear ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch finished 13th in the Memorial and second in the non-PGA Tour Family Home 
Invitational to total $83,000 in his first two weeks with the new ones. Golf

TENNIS ROUNDUP; SAMPRAS SAVES MATCH POINT, WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Sampras saved a match point and rallied to beat Jan Apell of Sweden on 
Saturday, setting up an all-American final against Todd Martin at the Queen's 
Club grass-court tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras defeated Apell, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, while Martin beat South African 
qualifier Christo van Rensburg, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's final will be a rematch of this year's Australian Open, won by Sampras 
in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, frustrated by Apell's return of service in the first two sets, turned 
the match around against the 127th-ranked player with five consecutive points 
after falling behind, 5-2, in the second-set tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 One game earlier, the top-seeded Sampras had stayed alive with a service 
winner on match point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't worried about the match point because it was on my serve," Sampras 
said. "But then I was 2-5 down in the tiebreaker that followed, and I was 
concerned. It was in his hands to win. I got lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 A brilliant forehand passing shot down the line brought Sampras back to 3-5 in 
the tiebreaker. He then followed with three more winners and his 10th ace of 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell broke Sampras to start the third set and held serve to go ahead, 2-0, 
but he won only five more points as Sampras won the final six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while there he was kicking my butt," Sampras said. "I really started 
playing some good tennis in the third set. Before that I wasn't playing so 
well, but he had a lot to do with it. On a scale of 10, I would say I played a 
6.5." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Americans Zina Garrison-Jackson and Lori McNeil advanced to the final of the 
grass-court tournament in Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Garrison-Jackson beat Nathalie Tauziat of France, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 
while second-seeded McNeil rallied to defeat Brenda Schultz of the Netherlands, 
3-6, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's match will be a rematch of the 1993 final in which McNeil defeated 
Garrison-Jackson in three sets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dutchman Richard Krajicek used his powerful serve to beat Henri Leconte of 
France, 6-4, 6-4, in the semifinals of the Rosmalen Grass Court championships 
in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajicek broke Leconte's serve in the last game of both sets to advance to the 
final against fifth-seeded Karsten Braasch, who defeated David Adams of 
Australia, 6-4, 6-4.

GOLF ROUNDUP; JANZEN GETS HOT AT RIGHT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lee Janzen, his game rounding into shape for defense of his U.S. Open title, 
shot a seven-under 64 Saturday to take the lead after three rounds of the Buick 
Classic at Harrison, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Janzen led last year after 54 holes, too, before finishing in a tie for third. 
His three-round total of 11-under 202 led second-round leader Ernie Els of 
South Africa by one shot. John Wilson, Dillard Pruitt and Japan's Joe Ozaki 
were three strokes behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Janzen used the strong performance last year at the Westchester Country Club, 
with its sloped, quick greens and high rough, as preparation for his Open 
victory the next week at Baltusrol in Springfield, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Open begins Thursday at the Oakmont Country Club in western 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see the course play as hard as it can tomorrow," he said. "Either 
way, I still have to attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Janzen started his day with a bogey when he three-putted No. 1, a par three. 
</P>
<P>
 But he started a string of four birdies on the par-five fifth and he also 
birdied Nos. 11, 14 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start making birdies early you become more confident," Janzen said. 
"There were a lot of good scores today. When you see that it pushes you on." 
</P>
<P>
 Although golfers continued to say how treacherous the 6,779-yard course can 
be, several players made big moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite shot 64 for a three-round total of 206 and was tied with Ronnie 
Black, who shot 65. Hale Irwin shot 65 and was among seven at 207, including 
first-round leader Mike Reid. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Maggert, who barely made the cut at two-over 144, also shot 64 Saturday 
and was at 208. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can there be 10 shots difference from one day to the next day?" asked 
Kite, who had only one birdie while shooting 74 Friday. "I think that's just 
the nature of this stupid game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton shot a course-record, nine-under 63 and held a one-shot lead 
over Bob Murphy after two rounds of the PGA Senior Tour Nationwide Championship 
at Alpharetta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton had a 14-under 130 total for two trips around the Country Club of the 
South course. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy had a second-round 64 and was four shots ahead of Tom Shaw, who had a 
68. 
</P>
<P>
 Five were at 136 -- Lee Trevino, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Jim Dent, Graham Marsh and 
Larry Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, last year's Senior Tour player of the year with five victories, is 
still looking for his first in 1994. He is 13th on this year's money list at 
$267,747. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's Liselotte Neumann and England's Caroline Pierce had roller coaster 
second rounds and shared a one-stroke lead in the Minnesota LPGA Classic at 
Brooklyn Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Neumann offset four birdies with three bogeys in a one-under 71 on the windy 
Edinburgh USA course. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce had an eagle, five birdies and four bogeys in a 68. They were at 
five-under 139. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Alcott was next at 140. Beth Daniel, looking for her third tour victory in 
a row, and Australia's Jane Crafter were at 141.

BRAZIL STUNS U.S. WOMEN IN SEMIFINAL; BASKETBALL: AMERICANS HANDED FIRST LOSS 
IN 11 YEARS AT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in 11 years, the United States lost at the women's world 
basketball championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Hortencia and Paula combined for 61 points as Brazil stunned the 
defending champions, 110-107, Saturday night in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hortencia scored 32 points and Paula had 29 as the Brazilians reached their 
first world championship final. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't do the things we needed to do," said U.S. Coach Tara 
VanDerveer. "If you give up 110 points, that is a pretty good way to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first U.S. loss at the world championships since the 1983 final 
against the Soviet Union. The 110 points were the most given up by the United 
States at the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have the effort or intensity we needed defensively," VanDerveer 
said. "We had people who didn't play to their potential here. I'm not going to 
name them, but they know who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil will meet Olympic silver medalist China in today's final. Center Zheng 
Haixia had 36 points and 14 rebounds as China beat Australia, 66-65, in the 
other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States will play Australia for third place today. 
</P>
<P>
 Katrina McClain led the United States with 29 points against Brazil. Ruthie 
Bolton-Holifield added 17 and Teresa Edwards 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what Brazil could do, but we didn't seem mentally ready to play 
them," Bolton-Holifield said.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ASHBY HANDLES THE REST OF THE GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea was to not let the other eight Giants beat Andy Ashby. There wasn't 
much the San Diego Padres could do about Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 He homered, his 14th of the season and fifth in 16 at-bats against Ashby, but 
the San Diego pitcher contained the other Giants in a 3-1 victory at San 
Francisco on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say about Bonds?" said Ashby (2-5, with a 2.94 earned-run 
average). "I got a ball up where I didn't want it. I made a mistake and he 
crushed it. But I'm getting the ball down for the most part and it's starting 
to pay off." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first homer since May 25 for Bonds, whose last had been off Ashby 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After the homer, the only threat off Ashby came in the fifth inning, when 
Royce Clayton and Kirt Manwaring singled with one out. Mark Portugal (5-5) 
grounded into a double play and Ashby retired the side over the last four 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to tip your hat to Ashby and give him his due," said Tony Gwynn, who 
went four for five in his 32nd four-hit game. "He pitched well enough to make 
our small lead stand up." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn raised his league-leading average to .388. He is batting .415 over the 
last 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, Atlanta 6 -- Center fielder Roberto Kelly's error on James Mouton's 
single in the ninth inning allowed Luis Gonzalez to score from first base as 
the Astros rallied for three runs with two outs to win at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros had been limited to three hits -- two of them Jeff Bagwell homers 
-- over the first 8 2/3 innings by Steve Avery and three relievers before 
rallying. 
</P>
<P>
 With two outs, pinch-hitter Sid Bream singled off Greg McMichael (2-4) and 
Andujar Cedeno walked. Gonzalez's infield single loaded the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouton then grounded a single to center that Kelly overran. The ball rolled 
all the way to the wall as Gonzalez raced home with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 6, Colorado 4 -- The Reds won for the sixth time in seven games and 
the Rockies fell to 0-10 at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Down, 4-1, in the fifth inning, the Reds turned Charlie Hayes' throwing error 
and a two-run homer by Reggie Sanders into their 19th come-from-behind victory 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Fortugno (1-0) got his second major league victory with 2 1/3 scoreless 
innings in relief of Kevin Jarvis. Chuck McElroy pitched the last two innings 
for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 7, New York 4 -- Kirk Rueter, who left the Expos for 21 days during 
the illness and eventual death of his mother, pitched into the fifth inning, 
tiring with a 4-3 lead and not getting the decision at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Rueter, who has a major league record of 10-1, gave up three runs and four 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquis Grissom and Sean Berry homered as the Expos won their third in a row 
and ninth in their last 12 games. The Mets have lost five in a row and 10 of 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Gil Heredia (3-2) was the winner, Jeff Shaw went 2 2/3 innings and 
John Wetteland got the last out for his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 7, Philadelphia 4 -- Gregg Jefferies hit a three-run homer and Ray 
Lankford added a two-run shot for the Cardinals at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar Olivares (1-0), recalled from Triple-A Louisville on Thursday, pitched 6 
2/3 innings and added two singles and a run batted in. He gave up four runs and 
seven hits. Rene Arocha pitched the final two innings for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 10, Florida 4 -- Brian Hunter and Jay Bell homered and the Pirates 
dodged a thunderstorm and a three-run deficit to win at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marlins couldn't hold a 4-1 lead for the second consecutive night as 
Hunter keyed a three-run third inning with a two-run homer and Bell went four 
for four and scored four runs in the Pirates' fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell is seven for his last eight, with four extra-base hits, and Pittsburgh -- 
the majors' worst offensive team -- has 15 runs and 28 hits in its last two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the damage came off Marlin rookie Kurt Miller (0-1), a former Pirate 
first-round draft choice, who gave up nine hits and seven runs in four-plus 
innings in his major league debut.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 * UNITED THEY STAND: The alleged unanimity of the owners -- supported by the 
need for three-fourths approval of a labor agreement -- remains suspect. 
Consider, for example, Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris, who voted for the 
salary-cap proposal that will be presented to the players' union Tuesday. 
McMorris, with the Rockies having drawn 1.7 million for 31 dates and headed for 
a second season of 4-million attendance, has no real heart for a prolonged 
stoppage, and approved revenue sharing begrudgingly. "For 30 years, they told 
us (in the Rocky Mountains) that we couldn't support a team, and now they want 
us to support 27 others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McMorris added that baseball could solve many of its economic problems by 
being more receptive to moving teams. "You look at Montreal, Pittsburgh, some 
of these other teams that just don't draw . . . why not move them?" he said. 
"You've got Phoenix, Tampa-St. Petersburg, Buffalo, Washington, Charlotte, 
Jacksonville, Orlando. You could put teams in Mexico City, Guadalajara, 
Monterrey. You can't argue that any of those aren't better choices than 
Montreal." 
</P>
<P>
 * MANAGER OF YEAR? Rene Lachemann of the Florida Marlins would have to be a 
leading candidate. Lachemann has kept his second-year team in the .500 hunt 
despite putting nine players on the disabled list, including Gary Sheffield and 
Bryan Harvey twice each. Sheffield has been testing his ailing shoulder with 
double-A Portland, Me., and might rejoin the Marlins in Pittsburgh today. 
Harvey is rehabilitating his elbow with Class A Brevard County, Fla., and is 
scheduled for four appearances in a six-day span through Tuesday. "We need to 
see him pitch back to back," Lachemann said. "Until then, we'll do the best 
with what we got." Which doesn't include Harvey backups Jeremy Hernandez and 
Luis Aquino, also on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 * PICKET LINE: The players consider a salary cap restrictive and unnecessary 
in an industry producing revenues of $1.7 billion a year. Charlie Hough said: 
"The owners throughout history haven't been very straightforward with the 
players about profit margin and that's led to bad blood. They claim baseball is 
in trouble, but very wealthy people, smart businessmen, keep lining up to buy 
teams. Somewhere along the line they have to be making a profit from it. I know 
the players are." 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU GOTTA HAVE . . . : Yes, heart, and no one knows it better than Dave 
Leiper of the Oakland Athletics, who made his first major league appearance 
Sunday since August 1989, working in relief against the Cleveland Indians. 
Leiper had open-heart surgery in 1990 and two elbow operations that put him out 
from mid-1991 to mid-1993. He had a 2.05 earned-run average in 17 games at 
triple-A Tacoma before throwing 2 2/3 scoreless innings in his first two 
appearances with the A's. Icing on the cake, he said. "I've been battling this 
since '89. In the game, out of the game, in the game again. When I was out, I 
never thought I'd pitch again. Just getting back is an accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 * BIG FOUR: The Cleveland Indians' combo of Mark Clark (at 7-1, is anyone 
ripping the Mark

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; ANDERSON HAS DETROIT RETREADS TREADING ON AL EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Angel Manager Buck Rodgers got into trouble with his bosses when he 
kept referring to his patchwork staff of released pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers would be right at home with the Detroit Tigers, a haven for released 
and retired ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had so few players come out of our system that we've had to keep going 
outside for castoffs and bad boys, and they've been very productive for us," 
Manager Sparky Anderson said last week at Anaheim Stadium. "We've had very good 
luck with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, like some of their players, have suddenly come back from the dead 
in the American League East. Necessity may be the mother of invention, but 
credit Anderson for establishing roles and nursing contributions from the likes 
of Junior Felix, Juan Samuel, Kirk Gibson and Eric Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sparky likes characters and thinks he can change people by putting them in 
the right environment," said the grizzled Gibson, who re-established his career 
in 1993 after a year in retirement. "We all think he's nuts, but that's a 
compliment. The roles are well defined, and the guys accept and respond to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 With Milt Cuyler, Danny Bautista and Davis all on the disabled list, Gibson 
and Samuel are currently platooning in a hold-your-breath center field, but the 
Tigers had won 10 of 13 games through Friday to move within 4 1/2 games of the 
division lead and within 2 1/2 of a potential wild-card berth in the AL 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 After being 12 games out on Memorial Day weekend -- their biggest May deficit 
since 1958 -- and last in their division every day in April and May, the Tigers 
are now "sitting in a pretty good position," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we hang around where we are until the All-Star break, we can give 
these guys a threat," Anderson said of his division rivals. "I didn't always 
feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers still do it with the hammer. They scored seven or more runs in six 
of the first nine games of June and had hit at least one home run in 17 
consecutive games through Friday. A labor stoppage might do what opposing 
pitchers are having trouble doing, but it won't stop the accompanying comeback 
by what had been a long-dormant farm system. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gomez, 22, two years out of Long Beach State, has replaced Alan Trammell 
at shortstop, where he plays next to 25-year-old third baseman Travis Fryman. 
Anderson had turned center field over to the 22-year-old Bautista -- "By 1997, 
people will be talking about him in the same way they're now talking about the 
kid (Raul Mondesi) with the Dodgers," Anderson said -- until Bautista broke a 
hand Tuesday. Veteran Bill Krueger was released to make room for Phil Stidham, 
25, in the Detroit bullpen, and Greg Gohr, 26, joined the rotation this week 
and could make Bill Gullickson, 35, expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's oldest team at the start of the season is getting younger and 
seemingly stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on our way back," Anderson said. "We continue to add, sometimes by 
subtraction. You've got to start the process at some point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll take time, because it'll be piece by piece, but by 1997 this will be a 
very fine franchise, which is not to say we can't win before that. I think our 
bullpen is stronger than New York's, Boston's or Baltimore's. If we can get 
some pitching up front, we'll be tough the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain about the Tigers: The manager can tell it like it is 
without worrying about losing his job. STRAWBERRY UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants seem to remain the most persistent, but the Montreal 
Expos are the latest team to express public interest in Darryl Strawberry. "We 
can offer him everything except a lot of money," General Manager Kevin Malone 
said, referring to the Strawberry criteria as expressed by agent Eric 
Goldschmidt: A team with a chance to win playing out of a smaller market where 
there's less pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "As certain as one can be in a situation of this type, I'm certain Darryl will 
play this year and certain he's not that far away," Goldschmidt said. "I 
wouldn't say it will be next week, but my indications are from Darryl that he's 
pretty close to completing his program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's asked me to check his options, respond to the interest and bring it back 
to him for consideration. He's working out every day and swinging the bat, but 
he understands that he'll have to go out and play (on a minor league 
assignment) first. That's not an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants' acknowledged interest in Strawberry, stemming primarily from 
Manager Dusty Baker's longtime friendship and the inconsistency of an offense 
that was the National League's best last year, was heightened Tuesday by the 
loss of Willie McGee, who tore an Achilles' tendon and is out for the season. 
McGee, 35, faces a tough rehabilitation process and could be through as a Giant 
since he is in the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants will use a platoon of Dave Martinez and Mark Carreon to replace 
McGee, but have also recalled Amsterdam native Rikkert Faneyte from Phoenix, 
where he was batting .370. General Manager Bob Quinn said he would not give 
daily updates on the Strawberry situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense talking about it until Goldschmidt tells me Darryl is 
ready," Quinn said. "You can't rush somebody else's rehab program just to 
accommodate yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the San Francisco firm of Bonds & Bonds strongly endorses the 
acquisition of Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Bonds, the club's hitting instructor, delivered a needle at Tom Lasorda, 
the Dodger manager who had characterized Strawberry's addiction as a weakness 
rather than a disease, saying: "Anyone would be crazy to say they don't want a 
Darryl Strawberry, regardless if this had happened or not. He has a lot of 
talent and can still play the game. Put him with the right team that 
understands his problem -- and it is a problem, despite what his ex-manager 
says -- and if he works on his program to the fullest, he can be a productive 
player again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said his son, left fielder Barry Bonds: "He'd be around the right people -- 
Dusty, my father. They'd know how to keep him in line. He'd be around people 
who care about him. If he needs a baby-sitter, I'm it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whiten trade now?), Dennis Martinez, Jack Morris and Charles Nagy are a 
combined 14-1 since May 13 and all on a pace to pitch 200 innings, a Cleveland 
first since Bob Lemon, Early Wynn, Herb Score and Mike Garcia did it in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 * DETENTE: Baltimore Oriole Manager John Oates, on a hot seat and believing 
that someone in the front office has been cutting him up, and club Vice 
President Frank Robinson, who acknowledges that he would like to manage again, 
had a meeting Tuesday that produced only smiles -- for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank Robinson is a lot more secure and a lot stronger in the game than to 
have to undermine or back-stab to get someone's job," Oates said. "He's done 
too much in the game above the table to have to do anything under the table. I 
have no problem with Frank saying he would manage again." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE RETIRING TYPE? John Kruk will play on an every-other-day basis until he 
has recovered from arthroscopic knee surgery. In the meantime, the Philadelphia 
Phillies' first baseman said the draining effect of that surgery, following his 
radiation treatment and surgery for testicular cancer, led briefly to thoughts 
of retirement. "Then I realized that (life) is just paying me back," he said. 
"I must have had too much fun last year (when the Phillies won the National 
League pennant). There has to be a give-and-take to everything." SLUGGER UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Reds brought in Ron Gant for a physical examination, but it 
seemed to be a publicity stunt since Gant, still recovering from the broken leg 
suffered in an off-season motorcycle accident that resulted in his release by 
the Atlanta Braves, can't run yet. There would seem to be no place for him in 
the Reds' outfield of Deion Sanders, Reggie Sanders and Kevin Mitchell, unless 
Mitchell, in the last year of his contract, is traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation now is that Gant, taking batting practice but running only in a 
therapy pool, won't be ready until next year, but agent Goldschmidt said: "Some 
clubs are just trying to psych other clubs out by saying that. Anyone who has 
seen Ronnie or talked to Dr. (Joseph) Chandler knows he'll be playing this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but both Gant and Strawberry face the possibility of a prolonged work 
stoppage and the reluctance of clubs to make a significant financial commitment 
while unsure of how many games will be played after the July 11-13 All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mitchell, despite his 50-homer pace, hasn't endeared himself to 
Davey Johnson recently. Mitchell was involved in a Cincinnati area bar fracas 
Friday night and questioned Johnson's thinking when the manager questioned his 
team's intensity in the early innings of games and suggested that the clubhouse 
stereo might have to be shut off. "Maybe we're still doing the rumba and 
boogaloo (in those early innings)," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell commented: "Why's he complaining? What's he talking about as long as 
you get a win? I thought laid back meant sitting in the lounge chair in the 
sand and sun with a drink in your hand being fanned by girls in bikinis. Cut 
the music off if that's what he wants to do, but then he'll really wonder about 
the intensity. Then he'll really have laid-back people because it'll be dead in 
the clubhouse." BULLPEN MESS 
</P>
<P>
 Which came first, the Dodgers' inconsistent relief pitching or the undefined 
roles? It's a combustible situation fueled by internal sniping and 
second-guessing, some even by Lasorda's de facto godson, Mike Piazza. The 
manager, of course, is not to blame for Darren Dreifort's inexperience and Todd 
Worrell's early-season injury and unreliable performances, but he's the man 
responsible for sorting it out. 
</P>
<P>
 The most pressing concern is the talented Dreifort. He might resist it, but 
the Dodgers need to get him into a more relaxed classroom before they damage 
his arm, mind or both. He wouldn't say it publicly, but the rookie is now 
telling friends and teammates that he is concerned about his use -- in and out 
of games, up and down in the bullpen. Unfortunately, with Jim Gott going on the 
disabled list and Worrell and Lasorda obviously on different wavelengths, there 
probably will be no relief for Dreifort and little for a team clearly missing 
the reliability of Pedro Martinez and established roles.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; KEY TO YANKEE PITCHING HALTS SLIDE, 9-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their American League East lead in jeopardy after a four-game losing streak, 
winning only twice in their last 12 games, the New York Yankees turned to Jimmy 
Key for help. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't let them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Key (9-1) won his eighth game in a row, pitching New York to a 9-2 victory 
Saturday at Toronto. He is 15-3 in decisions after a Yankee loss, 4-0 this 
season, and is off to the best start by a New York pitcher since Tommy John 
went 9-1 to begin the 1979 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I pitch any differently after a win or a loss," Key said. "I 
don't look at it as any more important than any other game. Maybe that's why 
I've been successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Key gave up six hits in 5 2/3 innings against his former team. He struck out 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Wickman relieved and went 3 1/3 innings for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Boggs hit a three-run homer that capped a six-run sixth inning. Paul 
O'Neill and Danny Tartabull also homered. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill went three for five, increasing his average to .425. Pat Kelly drove 
in three runs and Don Mattingly had his second three-hit game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees took a 1-0 lead in the second inning against Dave Stewart (4-5) on 
Luis Polonia's RBI grounder, then blew open the game in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tartabull led off with a homer, his 11th, and Kelly had a two-run single 
before Boggs hit a three-run homer, his eighth of the season, all since May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 5, Boston 2 -- Mike Mussina shut out the Red Sox for 8 2/3 innings 
at Boston, retiring 19 of the next 20 after giving up two hits to open the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after the Red Sox got 17 hits in a 10-7 loss, Mussina (9-3) silenced 
Boston's batters until Mo Vaughn broke up the shutout with a two-run double in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved the Orioles into second place in the AL East, one game ahead 
of the Red Sox, who have lost eight of their last nine games. Baltimore has won 
five of six. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 6, Chicago 0 -- Kevin Tapani won his seventh game in a row, giving 
up six hits and striking out four at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapani (8-2) got ample support from Jeff Reboulet, who had three hits, 
including a bases-loaded double. The Twins scored all of their runs with two 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago starter Alex Fernandez (5-7) gave up six runs on nine hits in six 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 5, Milwaukee 2 -- Sandy Alomar Jr. hit a three-run homer and Jason 
Grimsley pitched a five-hitter for his first victory of the season as the 
Indians won at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alomar's 420-foot shot in the third inning and Jim Thome's 435-foot homer in 
the seventh were two of only four hits the Indians managed against Cal Eldred 
(6-7), who walked five and struck out a season-high 10 in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, Texas 3 -- Greg Gagne broke a tie with an eighth-inning 
sacrifice fly, and the Royals ended a three-game losing streak while breaking 
the Rangers' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Clark's three-run homer in the fifth inning gave the Rangers a 3-2 lead 
at Arlington, Tex., but Kansas City tied the score in the eighth when reliever 
Jay Howell threw away a sacrifice bunt, Gary Gaetti scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 After an intentional walk to Felix Jose, Gagne drove in Mike Macfarlane with a 
fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 6, Oakland 3 -- Dan Wilson hit his first major league home run in the 
seventh inning to break a 3-3 tie and Mike Blowers hit a two-run shot in the 
eighth to give the Mariners some breathing room in their victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Mariner runs were scored on homers, including a solo shot by Ken 
Griffey Jr. in the fourth inning, his 25th homer of the season. Tino Martinez 
also homered for Seattle.

<P>
 Kevin Mitchell was out of the Cincinnati Reds' lineup Saturday after 
reportedly being hit in the right eye by a bottle thrown at a night spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell stayed in the trainer's room before a game against Colorado.Manager 
Davey Johnson said Mitchell had blurry vision, but that the injury isn't 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell told Johnson and General Manager Jim Bowden he was at a 
restaurant/bar on the Ohio River with several of the Rockies after their game 
Friday night when a woman threw a bottle at someone else and hit him instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden a bottle came flying and hit him in the eye," Bowden said. 
"He's got a gash above the right eye and swelling below it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no altercation, from what we've been told. The bottle was not 
directed at him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell didn't go to the hospital and didn't press charges against the woman, 
Bowden said.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; GROSS LEARNS HOW TO PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shoulder stiffness that has plagued Kevin Gross since January has taught 
him to be a different type of pitcher, and the results have been good. "Instead 
of going all out, I'm learning how to pitch," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 In 12 starts and 82 1/3 innings, Gross has 76 strikeouts and 19 walks, the 
best ratio of his career. Andy Benes of the San Diego Padres leads the league 
with 88 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin used to pump, pump, pump. He is such a competitor and so fierce, he was 
coming at you all the time," said Fred Claire, executive vice president. "Now 
he is changing speeds, getting ahead of the hitter. He's learning more about 
pitching then he ever knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who had a 13-13 record last season, hasn't had a winning season since 
1985. But in seven of 10 seasons, he has pitched 200 innings or more, a factor 
that figured into Claire re-signing Gross, who is 5-3 with a 3.72 earned-run 
average, to a one-year contract of $2.7 million for this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who spends a lot of time in the bullpen when he isn't starting, 
staunchly defends the embattled relievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't get into a game, they have warmed up, and with all of those 
one-run games, they have a lot of stuff going on," Gross said of the team's 
league-leading 31 one-run games, in which they have a 16-15 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are getting in and not getting in every night, just doing what it takes 
to win, and they got worn out. None of us starters have a problem turning the 
ball over (to a reliever). 
</P>
<P>
 "You go down there while they are throwing, and they have some of the nastiest 
stuff you can see. It's not that they don't have good stuff when they get out 
there, but maybe it's that one (bad) pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda told coach Reggie Smith last fall that Tim Wallach needed 
to change his swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The saying, 'It's tough to each old dogs new tricks' applies here," Lasorda 
said. "Wallach had hit a certain way for so many years, and he had a lot of 
successful years that way. But I told Wallach, the greatest golfers in the 
country keep a coach with them so when they fall into bad habits they can put 
them back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the power he displayed at certain times, and he can play the hell out 
of third base. There was no problem defensively. It was just a matter of 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, who batted .222 with 62 runs batted in and 12 home runs last season, 
is batting .274 with 47 RBIs and 15 home runs this season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers agreed to terms with their No. 1 draft pick, high school catcher 
Paul Konerko, and he will join the rookie camp at Vero Beach, Fla. The signing 
went a lot smoother than that of the No. 1 pick last year, when it took Darren 
Dreifort three months to come to terms. . . . During the second inning, a fire 
broke out on the roof of a nearby apartment building that was visible from 
Wrigley Field. There were reportedly no injuries. . . . Dodger photographer Jon 
SooHoo suggested to Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully that he and the Cubs' Harry 
Caray take a photograph together. "OK,' Scully said, "for the archives." Scully 
walked into Caray's booth at Wrigley Field and Caray quickly got up and posed.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; EASLEY TO WAIT ONE MORE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Infielder Damion Easley, on the disabled list because of an inflamed right 
shoulder, was expected to start playing catch and take batting practice 
Saturday, but the Angel medical staff told him to wait another day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking the conservative approach I guess," Easley said. "I've had the 
full range of motion since Thursday and it has felt fine the last couple of 
days, so I'm wondering as much as you. Ned (Bergert, team trainer) said we 
would wait until it felt good and then take an extra day, so I guess I was 
forewarned." 
</P>
<P>
 Easley is eligible to return on Tuesday and said he expects to enter the 
starting lineup immediately, although he doesn't know how sharp he will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Easley is destined to play second base when Eduardo Perez returns from 
triple-A Vancouver, but expects to return to third until Perez is promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has told me differently," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann acknowledges he hasn't been able to find a diversion 
to keep the team's recent struggles from weighing heavily on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go out and run, but I still think about it," he said. "I watch TV, but it's 
running through my mind. I just can't seem to leave it at the park. I'd like 
to, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he had considered turning over a table of food in the clubhouse, he 
said: "Not unless I had already eaten." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to evaluate his performance so far, Lachemann gave himself a grade of 
C-minus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're 8-12 since I got here," he said before Saturday night's game, "and 
that's not very good. This game is graded by wins and losses. You can't try and 
run and hide from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann was reminded that Angel management said victories and defeats had 
nothing to do with the firing of Buck Rodgers, and that teaching and nurturing 
a young team were given as reasons Lachemann was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teaching is always a part of major league baseball, but you have to win along 
the way," he said. "We have to improve and improving means winning more games 
than we are right now." 
</P>
<P>

 Catcher Greg Myers, who suffered a hamstring injury while rehabilitating a 
knee, said he hopes to begin another rehabilitation assignment with Class-A 
Lake Elsinore in the next couple of days. "There's still some soreness in the 
knee, but I'm learning to tolerate it," he said. . . . Pitcher Scott Lewis, on 
the disabled list because of a strained neck, is scheduled to join Lake 
Elsinore Monday and pitch two innings on Thursday. . . . Pitcher Julio Valera, 
recovering from elbow surgery on July 8, 1993, will also join Lake Elsinore and 
start Monday's game against Bakersfield. JOHN WEYLER

ERVINE MAKES ANOTHER BIG SPLASH; SOCCER: HE SCORES THREE GOALS AND ADDS THREE 
ASSISTS TO LEAD ANAHEIM PAST THE SAN JOSE GRIZZLIES, 10-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Note to marketing department: Get Dale Ervine into the community or on a 
poster ASAP. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash may not lead the Continental Indoor Soccer League in attendance 
this year -- it drew 3,615 to The Pond of Anaheim Saturday night -- but it does 
appear to have one of the league's emerging superstars. 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine had three goals and three assists to lead the Splash to a 10-3 victory 
over San Jose. This coming off a three-goal performance in the team's debut 
Friday night. The Splash (2-0) and Portland (2-0) lead the CISL's Western 
Division. The expansion Grizzlies are 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine's performance overshadowed another outstanding defensive effort and 
superb individual performances by Doug Neely (three goals), Raffaele Ruotolo 
(goal, two assists) and goalkeeper Jorge Valenzuela (14 saves). 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely one of the best forwards that's ever played this game," 
Splash Coach George Fernandez said of Ervine, an eight-year veteran of the 
Wichita Wings of the Major Soccer League. "He's been doing it a long time, and 
it's his first year in the league. I don't know how he'll do, but if you look 
at his past, he'll do damn well in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine was an indoor soccer scoring leader in 1990-91, getting 62 goals in 52 
games. Already he has six goals and three assists in two. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the indoor game, (forward Rod Castro) and myself are going to get 
opportunities," Ervine said. "It's just whether we'll put those chances away. 
The team, as a whole, has been playing well enough to get us those 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 As it did against Las Vegas, the Splash concentrated too much on individual 
efforts early on. Once it began playing to the open teammates, the Splash 
squeezed the life out of the Grizzlies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash trailed, 2-1, but scored successive goals by Paul McDonnell -- the 
first professional goal for the rookie from Cal State Fullerton -- Castro and 
Neely before allowing a short-handed goal 13 minutes 33 seconds into the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 As it did against Las Vegas, the Splash scored the final six goals -- three in 
the third quarter and three in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "At halftime, (Fernandez) wanted us to concentrate on defense," Ervine said. 
"He said, 'If they don't score anymore, we'll win.' We're solid in back and in 
the goal. Those guys deserve a lot of credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela was hardly tested against Las Vegas when he made nine saves, butt 
he was put under the gun by San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight he did get challenged on some occasions and he came up big," said 
Ralph Black, who had a goal and assist. "When the game was still close, he came 
up with two big saves, and we need that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fernandez: "If we keep teams to four goals a game -- one per quarter -- 
we'll be fine, because it's going to be very hard to keep us from scoring more 
than four goals." Splash Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In the CISL's second night, defending champion Dallas (1-0) beat visiting San 
Diego (1-1), 6-3, in front of 10,183 in a rematch of last year's championship 
series finalists; Portland (2-0) beat Carolina (0-1), 8-5, in front of 5,133 in 
Charlotte, N. C.; Monterrey, Mexico (1-1), beat Houston (0-1), 9-5, before 
8,256 in the Astrodome; Las Vegas (1-1) defeated visiting Sacramento (0-1), 
9-8, in overtime. . . . Denis Hamlett suffered a possible strained deltoid 
ligament 8:28 into the second quarter and skipped the remainder of the first 
half. He played in the second. . . . CISL Commissioner Ron Weinstein, who 
attended the Splash debut Friday, said the league was close to an international 
television package that would put games in more than 300 million homes.

WORLD CUP '94 / DAILY REPORT; NEW DALLAS THEME: DON'T HALF-FENCE ME IN -- OR

 The Dallas World Cup venue resolved one conflict and headed into another 
Saturday when workers began removing part of a controversial security fence and 
a local group threatened to picket matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's been a very visual symbol of confrontation," said venue director 
Bill Stroube of the chain-link fence, erected by the Dallas City Council at the 
Cotton Bowl in May despite opposition from FIFA and World Cup organizers.The 
fence will be taken down on the side where television cameras will be located, 
but soccer officials said they would try to get it removed all around the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas police wanted the fence to prevent possible outbreaks of hooliganism. 
World Cup officials said it was unnecessary and insulting to fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's Dallas Morning News reported a local group as saying it intended to 
"boycott and picket" games in protest of the organizers' failure to award 
sufficient contracts to ethnic minorities. The first match at the stadium is 
between Spain and South Korea on Friday.

 Striker Giuseppe Signori scored for the third consecutive game, giving Italy a 
1-0 victory over Costa Rica in New Haven, Conn., in its final World Cup warm-up 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Signori, who led the Italian League in scoring this season with 23 goals for 
Lazio of Rome, connected with 30 minutes remaining off a pass from Roberto 
Baggio, the world player of the year in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians open against Ireland next Saturday at East Rutherford, N.J.

<P>
 At Montreal, Marco Pascolo, Switzerland's No. 1 goalkeeper, returned with a 
bandaged knee after a three-week absence and played the first half of a 
scoreless tie against Bolivia in a game in which the two sides attacked only in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephane Chapuisat wasted several scoring chances near the end of the first 
half for the Swiss, who open World Cup play on Saturday against the United 
States in Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 At Miami, Luis Garcia scored on a penalty kick and a 15-yard shot in the first 
half, Carlos Hermosillo scored in the 78th minute and Hugo Sanchez returned 
from a two-month layoff, playing the first 69 minutes of Mexico's 3-0 victory 
over Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, a 35-year-old forward, has been out seven weeks because of a torn 
thigh muscle. He was Mexico's hero at the 1986 World Cup and a five-time 
scoring leader in Spain.

 Cameroon players in Santa Barbara said they voted to replace Stephan Tataw as 
captain with goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell, who has been among the players 
asking for higher bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell got 14 of 22 votes, Tataw got two and Roger Milla one.

<P>
 Leaving nothing to chance, Norway's team doctor was worried that ice cubes 
made from tap water at a hotel in Princeton, N.J., could contain bacteria that 
would make the players ill, so ice is being withheld from the team until an 
analysis of the water is completed.

 At Brazil, fans were angry that television networks used poor camera angles in 
exhibitions against Canada and Honduras during the past two weeks to keep from 
showing advertising for Brahma, a Brazilian brewery. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than pay large fees for World Cup game advertising rights on the Globo 
and Bandeirantes networks, brewery publicists gave fans giant banners to take 
to the stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 During the games, cameras have kept to narrow shots in order to avoid the 
banners on the stands. Executives for the two networks said they will go back 
to normal camera angles for today's game against El Salvador at Fresno.

 At Duncanville, Texas, Jeong Woon Ko scored one goal and assisted on another 
as South Korea beat Honduras, 3-0, in its final tuneup.

game because of an injury sustained against Ecuador this week.

 Alan Rothenberg, the chief U.S. organizer, is taking a "glass is half-full" 
approach to polls that show only one-quarter to one-third of Americans realize 
the tournament is being played in the United States this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're making incredible progress," Rothenberg said. "The last poll 
said 20%. Now it's 31%. That's a 50% increase."

 The last World Cup team scheduled to arrive is defending champion Germany,

before a crowd expected to include President Clinton and German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl.

TIGER'S NEW SWING A STROKE OF GENIUS; GOLFER OF THE YEAR: WESTERN'S WOODS TAKES 
HIS GAME TO A HIGHER LEVEL DURING HIS SENIOR SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Tiger Woods finished 39-under-par in his final season for the Western High 
golf team. Needless to say, he made a few impressive shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Western Coach Don Crosby, one stands out. Woods was in the rough on a 
45-degree slope above and about 15 feet from the 18th green at Olympic View 
Golf Club in Victoria, British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much at stake; Western was on a spring-break trip and already had 
wrapped up a tournament against two Canadian teams, but a crowd of about 300 
and some local television news cameras had gathered to watch "The Tiger." 
</P>
<P>
 The 18th is a 520-yard par-5 to a three-level green. The pin was on Woods' 
side, giving him about 12 feet of green with which to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hits it 30 or 40 feet straight up in the air," Crosby said. "It bounces 
once or twice and goes in the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't make it when he was practicing, but when you put all these people 
around him, he seems almost destined to make shots like that." 
</P>
<P>
 That eagle in late March moved Woods, The Times Orange County golfer of the 
year, to three-under for the season and might have been a turning point. Since 
last summer, he has reworked his swing and he is just now beginning to reap the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 His previous swing was good enough to win a record three USGA Junior Amateur 
Championships, but it was failing him when he competed against more experienced 
players in amateur and PGA Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
 High school players have had enough problems with Woods in the past. This 
season, forget it. He won his fourth Orange League title by 20 strokes and won 
his record-tying third Southern Section title by four, shooting a section 
record 66 at La Cumbre Country Club in Santa Barbara.

IN THE LONG RUN, HE OUTDISTANCES FIELD; ATHLETE OF THE YEAR: JAIME MARTINEZ OF 
ORANGE WAS NEVER BEATEN BY A COUNTY ATHLETE AT ANY DISTANCE THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He definitely took a different path to get there, but Orange's Jaime Martinez 
arrived this season as the county's most dominant track and field athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior, who began his distance running career in his sophomore year, is 
The Times Orange County boys' track and field athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez swept through the Orange County Championships and Century League 
meets, winning the 1,500- and 3,000-meter races in the former and the 1,600 and 
3,200 in the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panther athlete didn't lose to a county athlete at any distance this 
season. Martinez had the same record against county competition during 
cross-country last fall, earning athlete of the year honors in that sport as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 A soccer player who wasn't having much success on the field, Martinez asked 
Orange track and field Coach Lanny Carter for a tryout in February, 1992. Two 
years later, Martinez is a veteran of two Kinney National Cross-Country teams 
and twice has finished among the top five in the 3,200 at the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez began his assault on the record books by breaking the meet record in 
the 3,000 at the Orange County Championships on April 23. He raced alone nearly 
the entire distance, finishing in 8 minutes 38.64 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The time completed a winning double for Martinez, who also won the 1,500 in 
3:56.89. That time bested the next-best runner in the field by more than eight 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks earlier at the Arcadia Invitational, one of the nation's elite 
events, Martinez ran a then-personal best 4:14.47 to finish seventh in the 
1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez maintained his perch atop the list of the county's best marks in the 
3,200 from the first race of his senior season until the last. 
</P>
<P>
 The recipient of the first Earl Engman Memorial Scholarship for academic and 
athletics achievement, Martinez also was named Orange High School's athlete of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez won the 3,200 (9:13.77) at the Southern Section Division I finals and 
finished third in the 1,600 in a personal-best 4:14.01. However, he decided to 
drop the shorter distance and concentrate on the two-mile race at the Masters 
Meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy paid off as Martinez clocked a personal-best 9:06.08 to win and 
advance to the State finals, where he finished fifth in 9:06.94. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never had a youngster like him," Carter said. "I wouldn't trade him 
for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez will attend Azusa Pacific this fall.

BOXING; PAEZ'S EASY 10-ROUND DECISION COULD LEAD HIM TO DE LA HOYA

<P>
 Former International Boxing Federation featherweight champion Jorge Paez won a 
lopsided 10-round decision over Juan Gomez in their lightweight bout Saturday 
night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez, from Mexicali, Mexico, started slowly but took clear command by the 
fourth round to win by scores of 97-92, 97-92 and 99-90 on the judges' cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory improves Paez's record to 51-6-4, with 31 knockouts. It probably 
also secures a July 29 match against undefeated Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez weighed 134 1/4 pounds. Gomez, also from Mexicali, weighed 132 3/4. He is 
now 13-4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In another featured bout, flyweight Mark Johnson won his 19th fight in a row, 
knocking out Jose Quirino in the third round of their scheduled 12-rounder. 
Johnson, from Washington, D.C., weighed 111 as he improved his record to 20-1, 
with 13 knockouts. Quirino, from Tijuana, weighed 112 and is now 34-14. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pair of 10-round bouts, Carlos Hernandez, 133 1/2, of Bellflower, knocked 
out Tijuana's Tommy Valdez, 134, in the second round; and former World Boxing 
Council champion Daniel Zaragoza of Mexico City, 126, won a unanimous decision 
over Francisco Soto, 124 1/4, Durango, Mexico.

NEWSWIRE: MANSELL ON POLE IN DETROIT'S RUMOR CENTRAL

 Even as Nigel Mansell was leading the field in rumors, he was leading it in 
qualifying for today's Detroit Grand Prix, pushing his Lola-Ford around the 
2.1-mile, 14-turn course at Belle Isle Park at an average speed of 108.649 
m.p.h. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Unser Jr. will start alongside Mansell on the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell continued to insist that he would drive every race on the Indy-car 
circuit this year, with 10 remaining. But there is nothing in his contract to 
prevent his driving in races that do not conflict, and there has been 
speculation -- much of it from his native England -- that he would return to 
Formula One, where he was champion in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really upset with a lot of media who have actually speculated, actually 
saying that I will be doing the British Grand Prix," he said. "It clashes with 
Cleveland, and I will be in Cleveland. I think they are trying to sell tickets 
to the race (in England) on the premise that I will be there."

</P>

 He completed the 27-lap race on the 1.74-mile circuit at an average speed of

 University of Florida President John Lombardi said he didn't approve of Coach 
Steve Spurrier's criticism of archrival Florida State, which has been staggered 
by allegations of players taking money and merchandise from agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The University of Florida has no standing to criticize any other university," 
Lombardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurrier referred to FSU as "Free Shoes University." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing at the same St. Petersburg, Fla., meeting as Lombardi, Florida State 
President Talbot (Sandy) D'Alemberte said, "Coach Spurrier's comments made me 
very very proud of (Seminole Coach) Bobby Bowden. I don't ever remember coach 
Bowden taking any shots at anybody else when they were in trouble." Track and

WEST BLOCK PARTY IS ROUGH LOSS FOR EAST; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: PENALTIES ON 
LATE FIELD-GOAL TRIES PIVOTAL IN VENTURA COUNTY ALL-STAR GAME. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a chance for a classic turnabout for the East team in the Ventura 
County all-star football game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the fourth quarter, a roughing the kicker penalty on a 52-yard 
field goal attempt prolonged a drive that ended in a touchdown that gave the 
West a two-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley quarterback Jeremie Watkins (nine of 19, 94 yards) then drove the 
East to the 16-yard line, but Mark Schwanauer's 33-yard field goal attempt was 
blocked as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the West was called for running into the kicker, giving Schwanauer a 
second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But three Ventura High players converged on Schwanauer and blocked the 28-yard 
kick, preserving the West's 23-21 victory at Moorpark High. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing we hadn't worked on this week was field goals," said East Coach 
George Hurley of Newbury Park. "We did extra points but we didn't have a 
kicker. We didn't use one in the fall. He volunteered. It just came down to the 
kicking game," 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the first in three years for the West and gave Hurley his 
first loss after a 14-0 season in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 After the West's final drive seemingly died four plays earlier, Tafeaga Aina 
of Channel Islands, a 6-foot-4, 280-pound lineman, lined up in the backfield 
and scored the winning touchdown from one yard with 3:27 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a play we've been running all week for that situation," Aina said. "I 
just wanted to make sure we got the touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The West had little trouble getting untracked in the first quarter. On the 
second play from scrimmage after the East snapped the ball out of the end zone 
on a punt for a safety, Rio Mesa quarterback Don DiDomizio's 48-yard touchdown 
run gave the West a 9-0 lead only 1:32 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 DiDomizio led all players with 98 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The East came back behind Westlake quarterback Kevin Crook, who completed 
seven consecutive passes during an 10-play, 80-yard drive that culminated with 
a nine-yard touchdown pass to Newbury Park's Jason Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker had six receptions for 85 yards. Crook completed 10 of 16 for 94 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The East took a 14-9 lead late in the first quarter on a four-yard scoring run 
by Oak Park's Ryan Garth. Oxnard's Tim Westbrook scored on a nine-yard run to 
give the West a 16-14 halftime lead.

FISCHER, TUIMOLOAU KEEP WINNING AT GOLDEN WEST MEET; TRACK: PAIR POST VICTORIES 
AGAINST NATIONAL COMPETITION; MEDEARIS THIRD IN HIGH HURDLES. 
</P>

<P>
 Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High and Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands 
continued their postseason victory tour in the Golden West Invitational track 
and field meet at American River College Saturday in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing in 95 degree temperatures, Fischer won the boys' high jump with a 
leap of 7 feet 2 inches and Tuimoloau placed first in the girls' shotput at 
47-1 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who jumped 7 feet to win the state championships on June 4, cleared 
6-4, 6-8 and 7 feet on his first attempts before making 7-2 on his third. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed three times at 7-4 1/2, which would have established a meet record 
and equaled the state record set by Maurice Crumby of San Francisco Balboa High 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Kevin Dotson of Los Alamos, N.M., finished second at 7 feet, with 
junior Bobby Williams of Great Bend, Kan., third at 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real excited because this is probably the best competition I've faced all 
year," Fischer said. "I really wasn't hyped up today. I was just really 
relaxed, so I'll take 7-2." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, the yearly national outdoor leader at 7-4, has cleared 7-2 or higher 
in six meets this season and 7 feet or higher nine times. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau, the state leader in the shotput at 49-2, has gone 47 feet or 
further in five meets this year. Her top mark Saturday was 3 1/4 inches better 
than her winning put in the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
 In other events, Jason Medearis of Hart finished third in the 110-meter high 
hurdles in 14.30 seconds and sixth in the 300 intermediates in 38.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Blackshire of Norman, Okla., won the highs in 14.05 and Aaron Haynes of 
Wilbur Gross, Ct., ran a national-leading time of 36.48 in the intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Arce of Palmdale and Cathy Prater of Agoura had disappointing 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce finished seventh in the boys' 3,200 in 9 minutes 27.57 seconds and Prater 
placed eighth in the girls' 300 low hurdles in 46.1. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill did not compete in the long jump or triple jump 
because he stayed home to study for final exams.

KIMBLE PUTS THE HURT ON THE BALL; BACK PAIN BEHIND HIM, BUENA SENIOR BECOMES 
FEARED SLUGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball player Jason Kimble felt the first twinge of back pain near the end 
of his junior year at Buena High. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain slowly increased but Kimble continued to play all summer for his 
American Legion team. It wasn't until the Legion season ended, when he could 
barely bend over to pick up a baseball, that he decided to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor diagnosed a sprained ligament in the lower back and advised a break 
from baseball -- not the news Kimble wanted to hear heading into his senior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble (5-11, 190 pounds) missed the winter season, spending most of his time 
in the weight room rehabilitating his back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking to have a good senior year before the injury," Kimble said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But after not playing over the winter, I didn't have the confidence. I was so 
ready to play, I just wasn't sure how well I'd do." 
</P>
<P>
 With the extra bulk, Kimble increased his power. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised his batting average to .481, 75 points above 1993, hit four home 
runs compared to one the year before and drove in 37 runs, fourth highest in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The two months spent in the weight room transformed Kimble from a solid 
regular for the Bulldogs to one of the top hitters in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 He was named Channel League player of the year and tri-player of the year in 
Ventura County along with Ryan Hankins of Simi Valley and Jeff Bennett of 
Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble, 17, will be one of 17 seniors from the Channel League playing seniors 
from the Marmonte League in the Ventura Country all-star large-schools baseball 
game at Moorpark College today at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Coach Stan Hedegard has each of his Bulldog players list personal goals 
before the start of the season. Because of the injury and subsequent layoff, 
Kimble hesitated to list goals above his 1993 totals. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, his last memories of organized baseball were colored by pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the Legion season, when Ventura played in the Area 6 playoffs at UCLA, 
Kimble needed treatment from a heating pad just to survive the four-hour round 
trip drive each day of the three-day tournament. Once he got on the field, he 
could barely bend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play down there so badly, I tried to play through it," Kimble 
said. "It didn't help that we played at night and it got so cold out there, my 
back would just tighten up all of the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Kimble was cleared to play in February, he noticed an immediate 
difference in his hitting stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble had always been a line-drive hitter, but suddenly he was hitting for 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the season, Kimble tested his power against some of the top pitchers 
in the area, including Jim DeBiase of Chatsworth and Keith Smith of Newbury 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting hits off those quality pitchers gave Kimble the confidence boost he 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hitting the ball well and realized I had a chance against anybody," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedegard inserted Kimble into the No. 3 spot in the lineup. He helped Buena to 
a 15-10 record, second place in the Channel League and the second round of the 
Southern Section Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the goals we set to be attainable, but he just blew them away," 
Hedegard said. "It got to the point where I trusted him so much to get the big 
hit that if we had men on base, and he popped out, I'd get (teed) off." 
</P>
<P>
 During the league season, Kimble gave little cause for anger. 
</P>
<P>
 He put together a 17-game hitting streak and three of his homers came in 
league games, including a grand slam against Dos Pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble had had "one of my worst games ever," when the Bulldogs lost to Dos 
Pueblos, 8-5, in the teams' first meeting of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 When the teams met for the second time, Buena had just suffered a blowout loss 
to Rio Mesa, 13-3, in the midst of a tight playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Dos Pueblos, Buena fell behind, 4-0, and Kimble saw the team's chances 
at the playoffs fading fast. 
</P>
<P>
 But with one swing Kimble tied the score, and the Bulldogs went on to win the 
rematch, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble not only helped defeat Dos Pueblos, he transformed the meaning of a 
nickname. Teammates had begun calling him 'DP' after his miserable performance 
in the first game against the Chargers.  
</P>
<P>
 After the homer in the second game, they still called him 'DP,' but this time 
in admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble likely will join several former teammates at Ventura College, but is 
still considering financial aid options at Nevada and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kimble plays at Ventura, he expects to stay at first base, but if he 
attends to a Division I school, he will consider switching to the outfield 
because of his small stature for a first baseman. Hedegard doesn't think that 
will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his size shouldn't keep him away from first base at the college 
level," he said. "He reminds me a little of Mike Mitchell a little bit, and he 
had a monster year his senior year in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell graduated from Rio Mesa in 1991, played first base at UCLA, and 
signed a with the New York Yankees after he was selected in the ninth round 
last week in major league baseball's amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kimble isn't concerned about what might occur three or four years down the 
line.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, he's interested in proving himself against players from Marmonte League 
teams Simi Valley and Newbury Park. Buena lost to the Pioneers, 13-7, and to 
Newbury Park, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of those teams kicked our butts," Kimble said. "It would be great to end 
my high school career by proving I deserve that award."

GIBSON'S DOUBLE SHOTS ELECTRIFY ANAHEIM FANS; TIGERS: CENTER FIELDER RELIVES 
GLORY DAYS WITH GRAND SLAM IN NINTH AND THREE-RUN HOMER IN FIFTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Kirk Gibson swung so hard on the first pitch he saw from Mike Butcher, it 
looked as if he would twist out of his shoes. He missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, Gibson turned to home plate umpire Joe Brinkman and asked if the 
pitch was high. It was. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the top of the ninth inning Saturday night at Anaheim Stadium, and 
the outcome was still very much in doubt. Detroit led the Angels, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The bases were loaded with one out, and most of the crowd of 25,713 was 
sticking around to see how this battle would turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher's next pitch sailed in for a ball, and the crowd settled in for what 
promised to be something dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 It was. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher delivered. Gibson waited patiently, swung easily and sent the ball 
racing toward the right-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken on its own, Gibson's third career grand slam would have made it a 
memorable night. After all, he had broken the game open and sent the Tigers to 
an 11-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But coming as it did, after a three-run blast into the right-field bullpen off 
Craig Lefferts in the fifth, might make Gibson a candidate for player of the 
week honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Two homers and seven runs batted in -- that's a pretty good week even for the 
best power hitters. Gibson rolled it into one night's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the Anaheim Stadium fans thought so. Southland fans simply can't 
forget Gibson's dramatic, game-winning homer off Dennis Eckersley in Game 1 of 
the 1988 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds after he touched home plate Saturday, the stands emptied. The fans had 
seen what they came to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson had buried the Angels and made a shambles of their bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he sets his mind on something, look out," Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson 
said. "He's hitting incredibly." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gibson: "There's no explanation for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there was a story behind the grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to stay back and see the ball," Gibson said. "The (second) ball he 
threw me inside and I had been lunging for it. I over-swung on that first 
pitch. I wanted to relax and stay back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stepped out and said, 'Come on.' I wanted to get the runs in bad. Things 
were getting too energetic up there. I told myself to relax." 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed to work. Gibson waited for Butcher's curveball, then crushed it for 
his 13th homer and 44th RBI this season. He had 13 homers and 62 RBIs in 116 
games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Gibson seems to be reversing the aging process, Anderson nodded.  
</P>
<P>
 "He does look better to me than even last year," Anderson said. "He works hard 
and keeps himself in great shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing seemed to hold Gibson back on Saturday. He ran down everything hit his 
way in center field, and he didn't have to go full blast around the bases after 
slamming his homers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a marvel to me from the very first day I met him," Anderson said. 
"He has only one thing in mind: Win." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson tersely dismissed questions about personal achievement, saying the only 
thing that concerns him is winning. He said he was unaware that seven RBIs 
represented a career high or that six was his previous best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good that I came through for my team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded that the Tigers wouldn't have won without his contributions, Gibson 
wouldn't have any of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, the Tigers climbed on board and Gibson took them for a ride 
Saturday.

DOLACKI NOSES OUT BOAT IN MIDGET MAIN AT VENTURA

 Robert Dolacki of La Puente went wire-to-wire to win the 30-lap United States 
Auto Club Western States Midget Main Event on Saturday night at Ventura 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the first of the year for Dolacki, and his third overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Boat of Phoenix, the April 16 winner, finished second, with Jay Drake of 
Val Verde third. 
</P>
<P>
 Boat grabbed the lead at the start, but Huntington Beach's John Sarna spun 
between turns three and four on the first lap to force a restart. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest Boat was able to come to first place after that came on lap 14, 
when he challenged Dolacki as the cars came past the finish line separated by 
less than one foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-time Western States Midget Champion Ron (Sleepy) Tripp of Costa Mesa was 
on track to equal his best finish of the year -- a third-place effort at 
Ventura on April 9 -- when a kingpin broke on his car on the last lap coming 
out of turn four, 20 yards from the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 A wheel came off the car and rolled past the finish line while the car spun 
and stopped, giving the winningest driver in USAC Midget racing history a 
10th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Scott Hansen won his third three-quarter main event, grabbing 
the lead on lap 13.

DRUMMEN'S LUCK CHANGES IN STREET STOCK VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
 In six years of racing at Saugus Speedway, Jeff Drummen has not had much 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Northridge resident had won just one race in his career and 
struggled with engine troubles much of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Saturday night's 25-lap Street Stock oval, things changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummen took the inside lane while lapping Dustin Shepphird on the 10th lap, 
and slid past pole sitter Kirk Miller of Alta Loma on turn one before pulling 
away to an easy victory. "Miller went high and I just dove down and was able to 
get past," Drummen said. "Then we took off like a rocket ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller finished second, with Whittier's Greg Benner and San Pedro's Mike Price 
third and fourth. Street Stock points leader John Schultz of Valencia, who had 
to transfer into the race from the semi-main event because of a mechanical 
problem in qualifying, finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Results from the 75-lap Sportsman Championship Series and the 15-lap Street 
Stock figure eight feature races were unavailable at press time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20-lap Pro-Four Modified main event, 72-year-old Gregg Symonds of 
Agoura Hills posted his first career victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mal Borders of Van Nuys was second and North Hollywood's Garrett Yamada was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kluck of Huntington Beach also won his first race, taking the 20-lap Mini 
Stock main event.

 The Ventura County all-star baseball games have lost a bit of their luster but 
still will showcase most of the top players in two games today at Moorpark 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the three players of the year selected by the Ventura County coaches 
will not play in the large-school game, which pits top seniors from the 
Marmonte League against the Channel League.The game will begin at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley outfielder Ryan Hankins (.483 average, nine homers) will play in 
the North-South all-star baseball series in Fresno this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Jeff Bennett (.356, seven homers) of Newbury Park will miss the game 
because of a family obligation, according to Westlake Coach Rich Herrera, coach 
of the Marmonte League all-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The third player of the year, Jason Kimble (.481, four homers) of Buena, will 
try to give the Channel League its first victory in three years of the current 
alignment. Two years ago, the Channel League was no-hit in the first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera will have the services of Newbury Park pitcher Ray Clinton (10-3, 1.41 
ERA), Marmonte League pitcher of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game will match seniors from the Tri-Valley League against the 
Frontier League at 10 a.m. Between games, players from both games will 
participate in a home run-hitting contest. MICHAEL LAZARUS

BROCCO SCRATCHED; SORE HOOF; BELMONT: THE SANTA ANITA DERBY WINNER IS EXPECTED 
TO RETURN IN THE TRAVERS STAKES OR THE PACIFIC CLASSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Belmont Stakes lost one of its favorites Saturday morning when Brocco, the 
Santa Anita Derby winner, was scratched from the Triple Crown race because of a 
stone bruise to his right front hoof. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Randy Winick said Brocco might have been injured during a 
three-furlong workout Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't show up until Friday," Winick said. "It was in the best interests 
of the horse not to run him. If the race was three to five days later, we would 
have had no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco, who races for Albert Broccoli, the producer of the James Bond films, 
and his wife, Dana, recovered from a bad start to run fourth in the Kentucky 
Derby. He was listed at 3-1, the same as Tabasco Cat, on the advance betting 
line for the Belmont, behind favored Go For Gin and second choice Strodes 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 By skipping the Belmont, Brocco became the 10th consecutive winner of the 
Breeders' Cup Juvenile not to win a Triple Crown race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that Brocco didn't get to run," said trainer Wayne Lukas, 
who won the Belmont with Tabasco Cat. "But I don't think his being out of there 
changed anything about the way we ran our race. You have to feel for Brocco's 
people. They skipped the Preakness, giving the horse the extra rest, and then 
he seemed to be training well at Belmont Park." 
</P>
<P>
 After Winick discovered Brocco's problem Friday, he soaked the colt's hoof in 
ice water to reduce the swelling in the infected area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gradually got him from 50% up to about 80% OK, but that's not enough to 
win this race," Winick said. "We didn't want to hurt this horse. We didn't want 
any kind of incident on the track or even for the horse to look bad running. 
He's too valuable to risk anything like that. We've got a lot of opportunities 
later. It's heart-breaking, because he never missed a beat here. . . . He had 
three sensational works." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco will be flown back to California on Tuesday. He is expected to run in 
one of two August races, the Travers for 3-year-olds at Saratoga or the Pacific 
Classic against older horses at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous, another California-based horse who was stabled in the same Belmont 
Park barn as Brocco, has a bruised left front hoof and his trainer, Charlie 
Whittingham, scratched the colt from Saturday's $100,000 Colin Stakes. Numerous 
finished fifth in the Preakness.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; FLAWLESSLY, HOLLYWOOD WILDCAT RETURN TOGETHER IN THE GAMELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Charlie Whittingham and Chris McCarron both hope for a better ending today 
than they had Saturday in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham, who had to settle for third with Strodes Creek, and McCarron, who 
was second on Go For Gin, will join forces with Flawlessly in the 
$150,000-added Gamely Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Defeat in Inglewood is foreign to the 6-year-old Affirmed mare, who is the 8-5 
favorite in the 1 1/8-mile grass race. She is perfect in six starts on the 
Hollywood Park turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of the Eclipse Award the last two years as the country's top female 
performer on grass, Flawlessly hasn't raced since she took the Matriarch for 
the second consecutive time last Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she returned after a similar layoff and won the Beverly Hills 
Handicap by nine lengths. She will carry 124 pounds and McCarron, as usual, 
will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat, the Eclipse winner as the nation's best 3-year-old filly in 
1993, is the 9-5 second choice and she is also making a comeback. She hasn't 
run since having a five-race win streak snapped in the La Canada on Feb. 5. She 
has trained well for Neil Drysdale and is unbeaten in two races on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Bel's Starlet and Skimble, who won the Wilshire Handicap last month, are both 
6-1, then comes Empress Club (8-1), Dis Moi Tout (10-1) and Mz. Zill Bear 
(20-1). Dis Moi Tout is a likely scratch after she worked five furlongs in 1:00 
4/5 Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A champion in South Africa, Empress Club was a troubled sixth in her American 
debut for owners Mr. and Mrs. Laurence Jaffe and trainer Charles Pinnell. The 
6-year-old mare has trained well since the race and she has 15 victories in 21 
starts. Corey Black, who worked Empress Club at San Luis Rey last Monday, will 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a race reduced to four starters after the scratches of Norwich and Bon 
Point, Gothland won for the third time in six American starts, beating Rapan 
Boy by 1 1/4 lengths in the $103,200 Inglewood Handicap Saturday at Hollywood 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Gothland, the 3-2 favorite ridden by Corey Nakatani, split pacesetter Savinio 
and Rapan Boy entering the stretch and went on to win in 1:39 3/5 for the 1 
1/16 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapan Boy, the 3-2 second choice, finished nearly three lengths ahead of 
Johann Quatz, then came Savinio. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse is special," said trainer Wally Dollase, who also owns a piece of 
the 5-year-old gray with a dozen other owners. "He's such a wonderful horse to 
be around. He's got this presence about him. He's just a special animal." 
</P>
<P>
 A French-bred, Gothland hasn't been worse than third in this country and now 
has eight victories from 23 lifetime starts. He increased his earnings to 
$358,182. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to longshot victories by Romy ($69.40) in the Misty Isle Stakes at 
Arlington Park and Pleasant Dilemma ($20.80) in the Miss Woodford at Monmouth 
Park, there were no perfect tickets in the third week of the National Best 
Seven Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 This means there is a carryover of $106,819.11 for next week's Best Seven, 
along with a jackpot pool carryover of $43,177.10. The jackpot will be paid if 
there is one correct ticket with seven winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who had six out of seven Saturday collected $1,813.20. The total handle 
was $226,072. 
</P>
<P>
 The other five winners in the Best Seven were: Smart Alec ($6.80) in the 
Housebuster at Pimlico, Bay Street Star ($4) in the Colin at Belmont, 
Crusader's Poetry ($3.60) in the Southland at Louisiana Downs, Roany Pony 
($6.40) in the Senators' Stakes at AKsarben and Tabasco Cat ($8.80) in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Left without a mount in the $100,000 Moraga Stakes at Golden Gate Fields when 
morning-line favorite Cat's Cradle scratched, Chris Antley picked up Charlies 
Paradise and went on to an 2 1/2-length victory in the race for 2-year-old 
fillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over for David Flores, who was sore after being thrown by Our Last Brig 
at the start of Friday's fourth race at Hollywood Park, Antley directed the 
Florida-bred filly to her third victory without a loss. Owned by Mike Pegram 
and trained by Bob Baffert, Charlies Paradise paid $6.20 and covered the 5 1/2 
furlongs in 1:04 4/5. Just Plain Fancy, a 51-1 shot, was second, two lengths 
ahead of So Apropos. 
</P>
<P>
 Cat's Cradle, who set a Hollywood Park track record when she ran 4 1/2 
furlongs in 51 seconds in winning her debut on May 19, was scratched due to a 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son Grant called me this morning and said she had a 102-degree 
temperature," trainer David Hofmans said. "It was a surprise because she had 
been perfect (Friday) night. She ate up everything, there was no reason to 
think anything would go wrong." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani and Alex Solis both won three times Saturday. . . . Chris 
Antley, who rode three winners Friday night before heading north, has 14 
victories on 37 mounts at the meeting on Friday nights. . . . Paseana, who has 
been sidelined with a splint injury, worked a half-mile in 49 3/5 Saturday 
morning. Also on the work tab were Valiant Nature, the beaten choice in the 
Will Rogers, who worked five furlongs in 1:00 1/5 and the highly regarded 
European import User Friendly, who went three furlongs in 38 flat. . . . Bien 
Bien, second to Grand Flotilla in the Hollywood Turf Handicap, will not be 
going to Atlantic City for the $500,000 Caesars International Handicap on June 
26. Instead, he will make his next start in the $250,000 Sunset Handicap on 
July 24 at Hollywood Park. The son of Manila worked a half-mile in 49 2/5 
Saturday morning.

YAROSLAVSKY AS LAME DUCK A CONCERN TO COMMUNITY; SHERMAN OAKS: AREA LEADERS 
WONDER HOW POST-QUAKE REBUILDING WILL FARE IN COUNCILMAN'S FINAL SIX MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The election of Zev Yaroslavsky to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
comes at a tricky time for Sherman Oaks, leaving community leaders trying to 
rebuild from the quake wondering how the lame-duck status of their city 
councilman is going to affect their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation on the subject varies widely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will motivate him to get a lot of work done in the next six 
months," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., 
who said he was confident that Yaroslavsky would "turn Sherman Oaks around" in 
that time.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the six months remaining, I don't think he is going to have much time or 
focus to put a lot of energy into something new," said Nancy Schmidt, president 
of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake caused $160 million in damage to Sherman Oaks, making it one of 
the hardest-hit communities in the Valley. Seventeen apartment buildings were 
destroyed in a two-block area, countless stores were wrecked on Ventura 
Boulevard, and expensive houses slid down hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 In an economic aftershock to the quake, business plummeted after local 
customers fled their red-tagged homes. Progress has been so slow that even 
today many apartment complexes show little evidence of reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Yaroslavsky announced that he wanted to gauge community reaction to 
making Sherman Oaks a redevelopment area, one way of providing badly needed 
repair funds. Under that scenario, repairs would be paid for by the increase in 
property taxes that is expected as a result of improving the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Alisa Katz, Yaroslavsky's chief deputy, said she believed that few, if any, 
properties would need to be seized through condemnation, the redevelopment 
action that tends to be the most controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Gaines, a co-chairman of the Sherman Oaks Town Council -- a newly created 
coalition of the community's major organizations and leaders -- said the 
proposal concerning redevelopment confirmed that Yaroslavsky and his staff will 
display the same zeal and activism as he believes they demonstrated immediately 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, Sherman Oaks is still part of his (supervisorial) 
constituency," Gaines said. "His (new) boundary lines are just an expansion of 
his City Council district and will probably include all of his City Council 
district. In terms of his accountability to his constituents, it's the same 
group of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The race to succeed Yaroslavsky has already begun. Michael Feuer, executive 
director of a legal-services group, and Ryan Snyder, a transportation 
consultant, already have filed papers to begin fund-raising, and four others 
are said to be interested in the position. The council district includes 
Westwood, the Fairfax area, Bel-Air and Van Nuys, in addition to Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Which side of the hill the person comes from will really determine which side 
they'll support more," predicted Ron Mitnick, governmental affairs committee 
chairman of the Sherman Oaks chamber. "As soon as the candidates are 
identified, we will certainly be talking to them and working as quickly and 
diligently as we can . . . to make sure they keep us in mind and help us as 
much as they can."  
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's election, Mitnick had joined other Chamber of Commerce 
officials in complaining that Yaroslavsky had done little to address Sherman 
Oaks' earthquake woes. He helped organize a planned June 29 town hall meeting 
on earthquake recovery to encourage community leaders to fill that perceived 
leadership void. After the election, however, many of the same officials 
changed their tune, predicting that the lame-duck councilman would now have to 
begin addressing their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for their shift is that, beginning Election Day, Yaroslavsky's 
aides telephoned chamber and other community leaders to tell them about the 
redevelopment idea and another recovery program, which they said was in the 
works for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 That second program was developed to expand the city housing department's loan 
assistance program for owners of quake-damaged property, including a larger 
portion of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's aides invited leaders to a meeting to discuss the proposed 
programs on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitnick questioned the timing of, and motives behind, Yaroslavsky's recent 
communiques. 
</P>
<P>
 "It strikes me as very odd that a program that was supposedly being worked on 
since the beginning of the year was mentioned yesterday, and the chamber had no 
idea that this was coming down the pike," Mitnick said in an interview after 
the election. "To me, that's a political move, it's posturing, it's being done 
on Election Day." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Alisa Katz) felt that we were stealing her thunder. That's why they 
wanted to have their meeting before ours," Mitnick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz described Mitnick's assumptions as "absurd" and then added, "We're doing 
this because we're looking for the best and most effective program to assist in 
the recovery of Sherman Oaks. . . . We're working with the chamber on these 
things. We have invited many leaders of the chamber and we're looking forward 
to their input. They are a key player in this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said Yaroslavsky's office has done much to get Sherman Oaks back on track 
after the earthquake, including helping businesses get the necessary permits to 
rebuild, pushing for a city ordinance that reduced bureaucratic hurdles for 
people who wanted to reconstruct their properties, and working with local 
chambers to apply for a $250,000 economic development grant from the U.S. 
Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how active he believed Yaroslavsky would be in the next six months, 
Barry Wegman, executive vice president of the chamber, was among those taking a 
wait-and-see stance. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a scale of one to 10, about a five," he said. "I don't know what his 
program is, so it's hard for me to say. If he comes out and has a real 
proactive program, I'll change my mind. I'm just happy he's coming out with 
something."

OPPONENTS OF GAY PRIDE FESTIVAL FIND FEW JOINING THEIR PROTESTS; LIFESTYLE: THE 
PRIVATE JULY EVENT IS PLANNED FOR THE ANTELOPE VALLEY, WHICH IS HOME TO MANY 
FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIAN GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The founder of a group called the Alliance Against Immoral Conduct in Public 
recently sponsored an urgent meeting at the Palmdale Cultural Center. It was to 
plan opposition to the Antelope Valley's first gay pride festival, scheduled 
for next month at the local fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the valley is home to numerous fundamentalist Christian groups -- 
including one that made the nationally distributed anti-gay video "The Gay 
Agenda" -- and that local politicians have taken anti-gay rights stances on 
numerous occasions, it seemed the alliance would have little trouble finding an 
audience for its message. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're bringing in homosexuals from all over the country to attend this," 
John Fletcher, the group's founder, warned those attending the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the event could spread AIDS to local residents and that it would be 
the first step in a gay plan to gain control of local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their intent is to make Lancaster a homosexual community," said Fletcher, 42, 
a resident of Quartz Hill. "They're trying to make Lancaster another West 
Hollywood or San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong words. But in the rented room only 13 people had gathered to hear his 
message. And three of them were journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that a gay pride festival -- already an annual event in numerous 
locales across the country -- was going to be held locally certainly upset some 
residents, but given this area's reputation the outcry has been underwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only nine people, including Fletcher, wrote protest letters to Antelope Valley 
Fairgrounds officials. Approximately another dozen criticized the event in 
letters to a local newspaper and a few aired their opposition in calls to local 
television and radio talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatively low level of protest was a surprise to the leaders of the 
fledgling group that organized the festival, the Antelope Valley Gay and 
Lesbian Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really surprised that so few people turned out at (Fletcher's) 
meeting," said Todd Penland, president of AV GALA. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Penland was one of the non-journalists in attendance. He had gone 
just to observe and report back to his group. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was on the radio with Mr. Fletcher, to hear him talk, he had hundreds 
of members in his organization," Penland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher said in an interview after the meeting that he was only mildly 
disappointed by the small turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of 11 said his home computer contains the names of more than 300 
people who support his organization. He said he urged these supporters not to 
attend the meeting because he wanted to reserve the room's 50 chairs for new 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 He vowed to publicize his next meeting more aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either enough people didn't get the word," he said, "or I don't have the 
support I think I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing those who did attend, the former paramedic who now runs a private 
business, said: "I don't have anything against gays and lesbians. What I oppose 
is them coming out in public and parading it around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever seen two men French-kiss? I have. It's sickening. I don't want 
my children to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher said he might try to stop the festival through a lawsuit that 
maintains it could spread the AIDS virus, even though medical experts have long 
maintained the disease cannot be transmitted by casual contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Penland dismissed Fletcher's fears as "completely irrational." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the festival's purpose is educational and cultural. Participants will 
not try to "force" the gay lifestyle on anyone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The event, scheduled for July 29-31, will feature gay-oriented historical 
exhibits, speakers, entertainment and souvenir sales. Its goal, Penland said, 
is to allow gay residents and visitors to celebrate their lifestyle and to help 
others learn more about gay issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Penland acknowledged that those who attend may see dancing and displays of 
affection involving people of the same sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a private event with paid admission," Penland said. "People who would be 
offended by a positive representation of gay and lesbian life don't need to 
attend." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Penland believes the heated discussion concerning the festival 
is healthy. "It makes people who are sitting on the fence think," he said. "It 
also exposes the people who have virulently anti-gay feelings to the rest of 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The state-regulated fairgrounds is rented regularly for events such as fashion 
shows, square dances, gem and mineral shows, horse shows, Cinco de Mayo 
festivals and the Lancaster Mayor's Prayer Breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Latta, general manager of the fairgrounds, said he told those who 
protested to him about the festival that the fairgrounds could not deny it 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are legally bound as a public agency to treat all events equally," he 
said. "We can't discriminate." 
</P>
<P>
 Several city and church leaders who have made anti-gay statements said they 
will not try to stop the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may not agree with their moral value decisions, but I think we also have to 
be careful as a community not to interrupt people's right to congregate," said 
Councilman George Runner, who is executive director of Desert Christian School. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a preacher and a man of God, I know that's immoral," said Councilman Henry 
Hearns, pastor at a local church. "As a city official, there's nothing I can do 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ty Beeson, pastor of Springs of Life Ministries, which produced "The Gay 
Agenda," said his congregation plans no formal protest, although some members 
are unhappy that the festival will take place. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have a group over at the fairgrounds celebrating heterosexual 
pride," Beeson said. "What the homosexuals don't realize is that to the 
majority of people, their behavior is offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Ali, associate pastor of Vineyard Christian Fellowship of Lancaster, 
which meets Sundays at the fairgrounds, said fair officials have assured him 
that gays will not interfere with his church services during the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly disagree with the lifestyle, but we love the people," Ali said. 
"We'd rather not have the event there, but we don't feel it would do any good 
to try to change or stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 One local organization, the Lancaster-based Catalyst Foundation for AIDS 
Awareness and Care, plans to show its support for the festival by staging a 
silent rally outside the fairgrounds on the opening day of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show that gay people are human beings who deserve respect like 
anybody else," said Lancaster physician Susan F. Lawrence, who treats local 
AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence, who founded Catalyst, was not surprised at the low turnout for 
Fletcher's meeting. "There are an awful lot of people who don't share his views 
and are willing to accept other people just the way they are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Robert B. Harris, who is on the faculty of Antelope Valley 
College and who sees some gay people in his private practice, believes most 
residents will respond to the festival with tolerance. He said many of the 
area's newer residents came from Los Angeles, where diverse lifestyles are less 
likely to create an uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think ultimately for the Antelope Valley -- and especially for the gay and 
lesbian community in the Antelope Valley -- this will be a very healthy thing," 
he said. "I think it will help clarify that the Antelope Valley has a much more 
moderate position toward gay men and lesbians than this outspoken minority 
would suggest."

MALL MAKE-OVER; NORTHRIDGE CENTER WORKS TO ERASE IMAGE AND BRING BACK CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the walls -- and ceilings and parking structures -- came tumbling down at 
the Northridge Fashion Center on Jan. 17, 50,000 shoppers a day disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners hope a grand refurbishing will bring them back in even greater numbers 
when the mall reopens next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The current renovation -- which could cost as much as $60 million -- is aimed 
at turning the most battered of the area's earthquake-damaged malls into the 
most modern. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to be an open, clean and well-lighted place. And if the look of today 
helps erase the images of yesterday -- a crushed Bullock's store and pancaked 
parking structures, broadcast around the world -- then so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our desire is to bring it into the '90s . . .make it a more friendly place to 
shop," said Chan Chandler, a spokeswoman for the mall's owner, MEPC American 
Properties of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of dingy, 1970s-style carpet, shoppers will click along on 
multicolored granite tiles. Elevators and escalators will replace many 
staircases. And elaborate skylights will illuminate indoor palm trees and 
bubbling fountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major changes is going to be the skylights," Chandler said. "Right 
now it's really kind of dark, so they will really open it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The few skylights that were previously in place rode out the quake without 
shattering. Nevertheless, the new ones will be made of safety glass that breaks 
into small, rounded pieces without jagged edges should it shatter. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1971, the Northridge mall has undergone a handful of less ambitious 
renovations over the years, said Lloyd Miller, manager. MEPC bought it just one 
month before the quake, but was already planning a major overhaul when the 
temblor struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake speeded up the process," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the low ceilings and stark fluorescent lighting in the old Fashion Center 
did not make it a notably inviting place, the 1.5-million-square-foot mall 
still did a healthy business, and its overnight demise has affected more than 
just the merchants inside.  
</P>
<P>
 The 210 stores not only brought in an estimated $1 million a day, but also 
lured 50,000 shoppers daily, many of whom patronized neighboring businesses as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their closure had quite an impact, both in terms of employment and the 
so-called ripple effect," said Scott Spooner, incoming president of the 
Northridge Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 When the mall reopens, "a number of other businesses will start thriving 
again," Spooner added. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city of Los Angeles has suffered, losing about $10,000 a day in sales 
tax revenues, according to figures provided by Jim Hickey, the city's principal 
tax auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the homeless merchants, though, it may be the serious shopper who has 
suffered most. 
</P>
<P>
 A telephone operator responding to a request for the shopping center's number 
said, "Are they back open? Goody, goody!" 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet, but MEPC is doing its best to ensure similar responses when the doors 
do open -- which mall officials insist will now happen in early 1995, though 
earlier, overly optimistic announcements had it reopening this year. The 
company has enlisted award-winning Dallas architectural firm RTKL Associates to 
guide the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an open atmosphere and plenty of earth tones, the center will 
for the first time sport a food court, with eight to 10 restaurants and seating 
for 600. 
</P>
<P>
 And the infamous parking structures that collapsed -- one pinning an injured 
maintenance worker for seven hours -- will be replaced with parking "terraces," 
made of concrete poured in place rather than the precast type that crumbled 
more easily in the quake. Design changes should also make them easier to 
navigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler of MEPC said cost estimates for the work are not complete, but the 
price tag for a similar overhaul on a smaller mall the company owns in Las 
Vegas came to about $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 While the price may be hefty, such renovations are essential to remaining 
competitive, even without a massive closure, said Mike Hanssens, professor of 
marketing at the Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most retail outlets will once in awhile go through a major face lift," 
Hanssens said. "It has a lot to do with rejuvenating your market." 
</P>
<P>
 And for MEPC, refurbishing and updating other malls has proven to be an 
excellent investment, said Joel Blaisdell, vice president for retail leasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon to have double-digit increases when you reopen," he said, 
adding that after the 1992 renovation of the company's Las Vegas mall, revenues 
were up 10% to 25% 
</P>
<P>
 "The return will come to us," he said.

ABUSED CHILDREN TO GET A SAFE HAVEN; FOSTER CARE: CASA PACIFICA, WITH ITS FOUR 
COTTAGES AND PRIVATE SCHOOL, WILL BE DEDICATED ON SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ventura doctor Harvey Harris recalls the emotion that swept over him when the 
volunteer board he sat on launched a $10-million fund-raising drive to build a 
shelter for abused children: sheer terror. "It scared me," Harris said. "It 
scared a lot of people. A $10-million project had never been done in our 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, sprinklers are watering the week-old grass at Casa 
Pacifica. Construction workers are hanging the doors on the shelter's school 
house. Administrators are filing the paperwork for seven state licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-acre center near Camarillo State Hospital will be dedicated Saturday 
and take in its first foster-care children in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go out there frequently and just walk around the campus and say, 'We did 
it,' "said Helen Caldwell, who spearheaded the unparalleled fund-raising drive. 
"This is really a unique example of the power behind getting the public and the 
private sectors to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 But reaching this point has taken some work: Casa Pacifica's volunteer board 
spent years tapping the depths of the county's wealthiest families and cajoling 
the county and Congress into donating half the money needed to build the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members took prospective donors on tours of a similar facility in Orange 
County. They showed videotapes and architectural renderings. They hosted 
charity balls and bass fishing tournaments. In one case, a county supervisor 
used the power of her office to solicit a $600,000 contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when the group had millions in the bank and its architectural drawings 
in hand, the state changed the rules and essentially abandoned its support for 
foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant Casa Pacifica could build the center, but could not afford to run 
it or even find the foster children to fill the facility. The board quickly 
shifted direction, scaling back the emergency shelter plans and providing space 
for troubled and disabled youths who need longer-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the sudden, the change in the law said, 'Guess what, you're building 
something that's going to be obsolete,' " Harris said. "So we adjusted." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the state's 1991 funding cuts left the county and the nonprofit board 
with having to pick up more than $1 million of the $4.5 million yearly 
operating budget -- a sacrifice that county supervisors and Casa Pacifica 
directors say they are prepared to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like a seven-year pregnancy that's about to deliver," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby in this case is a unique facility designed to meet any need an abused 
child might have. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time it opens, Casa Pacifica will be licensed as a foster-care 
provider, emergency shelter, residential home, mental-health clinic, medical 
clinic, private school and, eventually, a preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 Abused children are now taken from their parents and put into emergency foster 
homes. From there they are transported to hospitals, mental health counselors, 
and even to police. Often these children are forced to repeat the same story 
again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Casa Pacifica will provide a team of counselors and medical officials on 
the campus. The children can attend school there, and if necessary come back 
for sessions with counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 One frequent critic of the project argues that the displaced children would do 
better in a home setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the brick and mortar mentality," said Bob Woodson, who once worked with 
a local child abuse prevention agency. "For a little 5-year-old girl who has 
been brutally raped by her mother's boyfriend, I don't think the institutional 
setting is right. She needs a warm, fuzzy, motherly type to hug her." 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica administrators say they have strived to make the campus as homey 
as possible. The 74 children there will live and eat their meals in four 
cottages. Brightly colored furniture, posters of kittens and puppies, bean bag 
chairs and plastic swing sets should help the children feel comfortable. "I 
think one of our challenges is to try to make it as family-like as we can," 
said Steven Elson, Casa Pacifica's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter also provides a better chance for reuniting families, because 
parents can routinely visit in a safe and supervised setting -- something that 
is often difficult in foster homes, Elson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casa Pacifica is more than just its building and campus," Elson said. "It 
really is a new way of intervening with families and kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency shelter can hold about 50 children who will stay from two to 45 
days. Another 24 beds at Casa Pacifica will be reserved for the residential 
program, designed for older youths who have already exhausted the foster-care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 These children, who often suffer emotional problems or learning disabilities, 
are now sent to residential homes in neighboring counties. Ventura County pays 
fees to the other counties, as well as travel expenses for families and county 
social workers who must visit them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, the county has paid $3.9 million to keep 163 children in 
residential care elsewhere, according to the county Public Social Services 
Agency. Some of those youths will start arriving at Casa Pacifica on July 18. 
There they will have a private school, as well as mental health counselors 
available daily. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hiring frenzy this month, Casa Pacifica should have 110 employees, 
including a nurse practitioner to deal with medical problems, counselors and 
teachers. Also, the county will provide about 20 workers, most of them mental 
health counselors and social workers. 
</P>
<P>
 To fulfill its commitment, the county must hire an additional 12 workers -- an 
item appearing on Tuesday's Board of Supervisors agenda. State and federal 
agencies will absorb some of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, the county will have to contribute $711,500 to running Casa 
Pacifica in the coming budget year, more than the board anticipated when it 
agreed to help build the center in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the increase is due to state cuts, which increased the county's share 
of all foster-care funding from 5% to 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, the sheltered care with its intensive team of counselors is 
more expensive than foster home care, a Ventura County grand jury warned in 
1992. The report estimated that it would cost $3,200 a month to keep a child at 
Casa Pacifica, contrasted with $702 in a foster-care home. 
</P>
<P>
 Elson does not dispute those figures, but said Casa Pacifica was never 
designed for short-term cost savings. Rather, by dealing with all the child's 
needs up front, the county saves money that would be spent later in mental 
health counseling or juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by the city and county of San Francisco recently indicated that an 
emotionally disturbed child left untreated can cost the system $215,447 over a 
lifetime. "This study gives concrete evidence that, without early and intensive 
intervention such as that provided at Casa Pacifica, long-term costs for all 
such children in Ventura County would be staggering," the county staff wrote in 
its report to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 That point is not lost on the donors who gave hundreds of thousands of dollars 
to build the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all realize that the better the job we can do with abused and neglected 
children, the better off we'll be as a society," said Dean Rasmussen, whose 
construction firm donated $172,000 in labor and equipment to build Casa 
Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Harris, the Ventura pediatrician who sat on the original board, 
remembers the discussions in 1988. To make the project work, the group would 
need a big donor. 
</P>
<P>
 As president of a local Kiwanis chapter, he turned to the civic group for 
help. "I begged, harassed, pleaded, cajoled and lobbied and got the division of 
13 clubs to take it on as their project." 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs pledged to raise $500,000 for the shelter's gymnasium. Club members 
are still raising the money, using pancake breakfasts, auctions, bass fishing 
tournament and yard sales. Former Supervisor Madge Schaefer saw another 
opportunity in 1989 when financier David Murdock came to her for a favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdock was about to unveil his swank Lake Sherwood development and wanted to 
host a nationally televised golf tournament at the development's country club. 
But he needed a county permit for an event of that scope. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer knew that McDonald's fast-food restaurants was involved in the 
tournament and suggested that the chain could donate to the proposed shelter. 
Ronald McDonald's Children's Charities offered $30,000. Schaefer said it was 
not enough. McDonald's offered $300,000. Again she told them it was not enough. 
Finally, Murdock offered to match McDonald's offer with $300,000 of his money. 
</P>
<P>
 For years after, Murdock hosted charity balls for Casa Pacifica at his country 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 The money continued coming in large chuncks: Oxnard rancher Jack Broome 
donated $350,000. So did Caldwell and her husband, Morrie, owner of Giant Truck 
Stops. The family of Otis Chandler, former publisher of the Los Angeles Times 
and former chairman of the board of Times Mirror Corp., gave $250,000. The 
Angels Auxiliary, a group of volunteers, has brought in $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell, who has raised funds for charities since college, considers the 
shelter project her crowning achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 67," she said. "I've had a bout with cancer. I just feel so good to be 
leaving this to the children of Ventura County."

EIGHT YEARS LATER, OJAI COUPLE SAIL ON A DREAM; LEISURE: THE PAIR CAP A 
BUILDING VENTURE WITH THE LAUNCH OF THEIR 44-FOOT BOAT. NOW, THEY'LL SEE THE 
WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since they took a two-week voyage through Puget Sound 15 years ago, Dugan 
and Janet Essick have been in love with sailing. The Ojai couple dreamed of 
building their own vessel and sailing to the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, after eight years of carving and crafting a 44-foot sailboat in a 
shed on their family's citrus ranch, the Essicks launched their sleek 
blue-and-white vessel in Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 And later this year, the 44-year-old carpenter and his wife plan to hoist the 
sails and head south for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to build a whole boat from scratch," Essick said last week 
while scrambling to put the final touches on the vessel before the launching. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the type to settle for a cheap do-it-yourself kit boat, the couple sold 
their home in the Bay Area in 1986 and started to build their dream boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We liked (sailing)," Essick said with a shrug. "We decided to sell our house, 
and it's been downhill ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who have been married for 25 years, moved onto the Essick family's 
65-acre ranch, anticipating a four-year construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 As four years turned into eight, Dugan Essick said his love-hate relationship 
with the boat grew. 
</P>
<P>
 "You love it so much you want it done, and you hate it so much you want it 
done," he said. "You just keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple lived on a smaller, 32-foot sailboat for three years before 
embarking on their 8-year boat-building adventure. It was then that Essick 
decided he wanted to build a vessel tailored to his own tastes and needs. 
</P>
<P>
 He started by erecting a temporary shed on the ranch and making a sketch of 
the boat -- from five perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with a wooden skeleton, Essick carved and crafted the sailboat, 
which was built upside down, and then carefully turned it over once the 
exterior work was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel's compact interior is adorned with an intermixing of African 
mahogany, birch, maple, and cherry woodwork, showing off Essick's carpentry 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 And the boat's cabin is slightly taller than most to accommodate its skipper's 
6-foot-3-inch frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you build it for yourself, you just make it as you want it," Essick 
said. "You can make everything fit your stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 The carpenter-turned-sailor declined to reveal the costs associated with 
building his customized sailboat, saying only: "It's a cheap house." A Ventura 
County yacht broker estimated the base price for a boat like the Essicks' at 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple named their new home Jeekers , after an English friend's slang 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a prerequisite for a boat name," 45-year-old Janet Essick 
explained. "It had to be something not serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the vessel's name is symbolic of its owners' nonchalance toward their 
impending voyage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan is just to leave and have a vague idea about where we're going," 
Dugan Essick said. "It's not real important. There's lots of nice places." 
</P>
<P>
 Places like the lush and tropical Marquesas, the Tonga Islands, Fiji, Tahiti, 
and New Zealand for starters. During the six-month-long hurricane season, the 
couple plan to stay in New Zealand, "which is a nice place to be stranded," 
Dugan Essick said. 
</P>
<P>
 But before they sail south for the winter, the couple intend to take the boat 
out for test runs to the Channel Islands and other less exotic venues. 
</P>
<P>
 To occupy themselves during the doldrums of their oceanic journey, the Essicks 
plan to read and dive, and simply enjoy the serenity of the seas, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 With no children and no pets, the couple plan to travel for easily a year or 
two, and are making no concrete plans for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janet likes the traveling," Dugan Essick said. "But I just love the sailing 
part and how the boat works. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like the lifestyle," he continued. "You're on your own, you're 
independent."

 Eric Wittenberg wants to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 He's willing to donate land to Ventura for a veterans' nursing home, which 
city officials say could generate up to 275 local jobs. In return, he wants the 
city's permission to build more than a third of the houses that will be allowed 
in Ventura before the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Wittenberg envisions 439 homes on 43 acres he owns southeast of 
Telephone Road between Saticoy Avenue and Wells Road. The 400-bed convalescent 
home would lie on 22 adjoining acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Council members say the idea is worth considering.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anything where we get land for development rights is what we are looking 
for," Councilman Jack Tingstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 County veterans say they are thrilled at the possibility of landing such a 
convalescent home -- which would be state and federally funded -- right in 
their own back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Veterans put everything at risk, and some came back and some didn't," said 
LeRoy Andrews, a Ventura architect and World War II veteran. "The ones that 
came back, the country owes them something a little extra." 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg, a Newport Beach-based developer, says he is happy to be of 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's absolutely important, whether it's our land or not, that 
Ventura gets the veterans' facility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the council agrees in concept, the convalescent home is by no means 
assured. State officials will meet in Long Beach at the end of July to 
determine which Southern California city gets the next facility. Workers just 
broke ground on a 400-bed nursing home in Barstow, the second in the state and 
the first in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg hopes, as the source of the land, to sway city council members his 
way when it comes time to parcel out allocations for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a lot of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In two weeks, the council will begin discussing which projects they want to 
approve this year. The latest Wittenberg proposal is not officially on the 
list, because it was submitted past the deadline, but council members say it 
will probably figure into their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, developers from inside and outside Ventura, including Wittenberg, 
are asking to build a total of 3,100 houses.  
</P>
<P>
 But the city -- bound by county-mandated air pollution and population-control 
standards -- only has 1,018 housing allocations remaining until the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rush to gain favor and the rights to build, the offers are pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
 One developer has offered to give Ventura land for a park, and $2 million to 
build it, in exchange for permission to replace 87 acres of lemon trees with 
437 homes at the northwest corner of Kimball and Telephone roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Another builder says he will construct and donate some tennis courts, a 
clubhouse and an 18-hole golf course to Ventura if council members will let him 
build 467 homes on the northeast corner of Hill and Telegraph roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Slow-growth activists have turned out in force at City Council meetings to 
oppose many of the other developments proposed to the city. But the latest 
Wittenberg idea remains largely unknown to all but a few city officials and 
some members of veterans' groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there'll be opposition to it, but a lot of people don't know about 
it yet," said Councilman Gary Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say, however, that the Wittenberg offer is precisely the kind 
of development proposal they hope to see -- one that offers them goodies in 
exchange for some of their limited housing allocations.  
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that the name of the game?" Tingstrom said. "We could negotiate with 
all (the developers) and get a little bit out of everything."  
</P>
<P>
 From Wittenberg, at least as the offer now stands, Ventura could get 22 acres. 
If the city manages to catch the fancy of the state commission, that acreage 
could translate into a $33-million facility that would be the second veterans' 
nursing home in Southern California and the third in the state. Construction on 
the convalescent home would not begin until the Barstow facility was up and 
operating -- in spring, 1997, at the earliest, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue with the council is, does the city want to put forward a site to 
the (state task force knowing) that if the task force (says), 'Ventura, you're 
next,' the city would have to give development permission to a developer?" said 
Everett Millais, Ventura's director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews, the local architect, thinks the right decision is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Having watched his father, a World War I veteran, move from home to home 
because the state's only veterans' convalescent facility near Napa had no room 
left, Andrews knows firsthand the need for more nursing centers for veterans.  
</P>
<P>
 "My father just passed away," Andrews said. "He was almost 100 years old and 
trying to find a place, while he was alive, for him to live . . . well, we just 
went through everything."  
</P>
<P>
 Andrews' father lived alone until he was 93, when he reluctantly agreed to 
enter a retirement home. The family first tried one in Ventura, but when he 
wasn't happy, they moved him to a facility in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 That center was good -- until it burned to the ground. "So we moved him to 
another, bigger home," Andrews said. "And it was fine but, well, not exactly 
what you would hope for. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too late now to do something for my father, but for other people, it 
isn't."  
</P>
<P>
 The county's veterans' services officer, Charles Lowrance, said that former 
soldiers need and deserve retirement havens of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Veterans in many instances have disabilities they received in combat which 
require a special type of medical attention," he said. "Also, veterans have 
certain types of entitlements that no other citizens have." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that is true or not, said Richard Francis, a local lawyer and former 
Ventura mayor, that is not the only issue at hand in a development deal at 
which more than 400 houses are also at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real question is a much bigger one," he said. "How many homes, how soon?"

DEVELOPER GIVES IN TO MARKET GONE SOUR; REAL ESTATE: WHEN FEW BUY INTO HIS 
COUNTRY CLUB FOR THE RICH, A LOCAL BILLIONAIRE TRIES TO MAKE HIS LAKE SHERWOOD 
HOMES MORE AFFORDABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Conceived as a community of weekend estates for the rich and famous, 
billionaire David H. Murdock's oak-studded Sherwood Country Club has now made 
its own painful concessions to a real estate market gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdock dug more than $200 million from his own deep pockets to build the best 
houses in the best climate on the best new golf course that money could buy an 
hour from downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirers praised Sherwood's classic architectural designs, but never bought 
into Murdock's dream. Nor did the billionaire's neighbors in Bel-Air embrace 
the idea of weekends near Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdock himself acknowledges a vision that was flawed from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't happen at all," Murdock, 71, said one recent warm afternoon over 
iced tea at the red-brick, white-columned tennis club at Sherwood. "We were 
told at the beginning that (home buyers) would prefer to come on weekends and 
play golf and tennis. But we haven't found those people. I don't think we have 
any old wealth here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura, while it is a maturing county, is not a county for super wealth," he 
added. "We found we had to cut the very expensive things I was putting in the 
houses, because they were overpriced." 
</P>
<P>
 So Murdock, confronted by a wrenching miscalculation, began to change his 
community -- planned for 630 homes -- to match the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger houses on prime parcels now sell for $1.5 million, instead of $3 
million. Floors are still mahogany, fireplaces are still marble, roofs are 
still Chinese slate. But the elaborate woodworking and silk wallpaper are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 And in his greatest concession, Murdock decided to sell two sets of homes -- 
condominiums inside Sherwood's heavy metal gates and lake-view houses outside 
of them -- for as little as $500,000 to increase buyer traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently petitioned the Ventura County Planning Commission for the second 
time to expand a cluster of stylish hillside condominiums that range in size 
from 2,000 to 3,000 square feet and cost $500,000 to $675,000. Once, 32 condos 
were planned there. Now 75 are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My associates in sales have had a strong influence on my decisions," Murdock 
concedes. "The public wants what they want, not what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to 27 escrows this year, Sherwood's total house sales have jumped to 
56, plus eight vacant lots. And Murdock, a corporate takeover specialist who is 
chairman of Dole Food Co., said he thinks he has found a way to win his costly 
Sherwood gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are beginning to have something we did not have before -- friends telling 
their friends what they have here," he said. "Success begats success. . . . 
Motion begats motion." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been nearly five years since Murdock unveiled his man-made paradise at 
Lake Sherwood on national television as top golfers, framed against a classic 
Georgian clubhouse, competed in Greg Norman's first Shark Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 In those exuberant days, the country club was said to have a waiting list of 
2,600 for just 300 golf memberships, despite a price of $150,000 for home 
buyers and $225,000 for non-residents. Annual dues are $6,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, only 140 golfers hold full memberships, excluding honorary members 
such as former Presidents George Bush, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty more people belong to the Sherwood Tennis Club, which sponsors a senior 
tour tournament hosted by Jimmy Connors. But the cost of joining the club has 
been cut from $40,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a response to the market," Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that 1,900-acre Sherwood is just another pricey subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 It sits at the east end of Hidden Valley, whose towering oak trees, 
white-fenced pastures and mountain backdrops have beckoned the moneyed of 
Southern California for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdock raises Arabian horses and Santa Gertrudis cattle at his 2,000-acre 
Ventura Farms directly across Potrero Road from Sherwood. Richard Widmark and 
Sophia Loren have ranches nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 And the membership of Sherwood Country Club is bolstered by Hidden Valley 
ranch owner-actors Tom Selleck and Robert Wagner, both members of the club's 
board of governors. Arco Chairman Lodwrick Cook is also on the board, as is Ed 
Hogan of Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The main clubhouse -- 60,000 square feet of dark wood and formality -- is more 
old England than modern America. The golf course, designed by Jack Nicklaus, is 
ranked among the nation's top 80 by Golf Digest magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the locker room, even showers are marble and their doors mahogany. One 
cubicle holds lockers not only for the three former presidents, but also for 
actors Selleck, Wagner and Jack Nicholson and athletes Nicklaus, Norman and 
Brett Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush and Reagan, and their Secret Service entourage, once helicoptered in for 
a round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Motion picture executives are members. So are Wayne Gretzky and O.J. Simpson, 
who discovered that strict club rules are binding when he was asked to change 
from shorts to slacks before teeing off. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites are required at the tennis club, which boasts a 1,000-year-old oak 
tree, hosts championship croquet and is said to be the only club in the region 
with clay, grass and hard court surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Those uncompromising touches -- and elegant model homes that reached back to 
colonial Georgia and ancient Greece for inspiration -- created the feel of 
exclusivity originally intended to sell Sherwood, but which has now begun to 
change out of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Sherwood paid its dues in a marketing sense," publicist Brooks Roddan 
said. "When they opened it up it was sort of David Murdock's private kingdom, 
sort of an adult Disneyland. But it also had a 'don't touch me' exclusivity 
that has been overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of rich weekenders seeking solitude and security in a country setting, 
its residents have turned out to be mostly middle-aged business executives with 
families who live there full time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our average age is no more than 45," Murdock said. "Unlike the people I 
thought we would get, the place is full of young entrepreneurs, starting 
companies, doing something." 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-two children attended an egg hunt at the main clubhouse on Easter, 
club general manager Tom Barnard said. And much of the club's activity comes 
from frequent weekend weddings, bar mitzvahs and charity events, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising executive Bob Crystal, who moved from Hidden Hills to a 
12,000-square-foot house overlooking the main clubhouse, said he is surprised 
and pleased by what Sherwood has become. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first walked in there, the place was overwhelming with the art and the 
decor and the country club," Crystal said. "In the beginning people spoke in 
almost a whisper. But now everybody is super friendly. You don't pass anybody 
without a big hello." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with its broader appeal, Sherwood has hardly abandoned its seduction of 
the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Passing a stunning brunette in the clubhouse recently, Barnard noted that the 
woman's leading-man husband, Joe Pesci, is a club member who may build a house 
at the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner Crystal is convinced, in fact, that although Murdock is allowing 
construction of cheaper lake view homes and hillside condos to increase sales, 
high-quality estates will remain the norm at Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the quality goes down, everybody will be out of here so fast his head will 
swim," Crystal said. "But I don't think it will. I don't know of a nicer place 
to live. And it will only take 50 more people, 20 custom homes, and you won't 
be able to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 If Murdock has begun to find his market, it has been a long time coming for a 
real estate investor with a knack for taking over struggling companies and 
turning huge profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The billionaire, a high school dropout who has made and lost fortunes, said he 
had no plans for Sherwood's 1,900 acres when he bought them for $19 million in 
1983. He wanted only to refill Lake Sherwood, which had been drained by a 
disgruntled would-be developer and left as a mud flat. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea of keeping the area in a natural state quickly faded. Murdock, an 
amateur architect and collector of fine antiques, began to hone his plan for a 
community that would both reflect his tastes and lure the super rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Wouldn't it be nice to create a place that was paradise," he 
said. "It is one of the best environments in America, . . . because of the way 
the wind blows in off the ocean. It blows in soft, sweet air -- pure. . . . It 
lent itself to a very fine and exclusive neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1987, he had sold Ventura County officials on his plan, persuading them 
that his new community would fix chronic water, sewer and lake maintenance 
problems for 122 homes already built at rustic Lake Sherwood -- a promise that 
neighbors now say he has largely fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdock spared no expense to rearrange the topography, flattening hills, 
filling canyons and moving about 1,400 mature trees to make it appear that the 
country club had been laid out hundreds of years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 By the first Shark Shootout in 1989, Murdock was ready to sell. Five large 
houses with classic designs -- including an English manor and Italian villa -- 
had been erected as the types of homes one might build for $3 million to $4.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But three years later, with expenses soaring, Murdock had sold only 17 houses. 
Even the smallest ones, about 2,600 square feet, were not moving at $1.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in late 1992, Murdock held a new Sherwood "grand opening," where 800 
invitation-only guests were chauffeured around in 15 white limousines. The next 
weekend, the gates of Sherwood were swung open to the public for the first 
time. About 2,300, beckoned by newspaper ads, trooped through. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we got one sale from that," Murdock recalls. "But people wrote 
me some nice notes saying how much they appreciated the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Though frustrated by the lack of return on an enormous investment, Murdock had 
spent mostly his own money, so he was able to ride out a bad market better than 
many developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a particularly burdensome bank debt, so when everyone else was 
in a great deal of trouble, I was just saddened," he said. "I thought, 'Why the 
hell did I do it.' But I'm not much of a quitter. I've had more than one ox in 
the ditch, but I got them out." 
</P>
<P>
 A turnaround began in mid-1993, when Murdock opened his North Shore at 
Sherwood tract of homes that is outside club gates and, except for spectacular 
lake views, resembles other up-scale subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Offered "the opportunity to apply for membership at Sherwood Country Club," 
customers bought 18 of 19 first-phase houses, which average 3,300 square feet, 
for $550,000 to $675,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that success, 40 more houses are planned and the price has jumped 
$100,000 each for slightly larger homes. A single story house was added for 
$475,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last fall Murdock began an aggressive newspaper ad campaign to sell 
red-brick Trentwood "townhomes" of colonial design, overlooking the Sherwood 
Tennis Club. Just five have sold. 
</P>
<P>
 But interest has been strong, officials said, and the condos have brought a 
steady flow of customers within the club's imposing gates. And some prospects 
have opted for more expensive houses instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a traveling salesman, Murdock is himself a pitchman when he wants 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a black suit, driving a black Lexus sedan, Murdock contrasts his 
first Sherwood homes to those he now builds. 
</P>
<P>
 The extravagance is gone, but the quality is still there, he insists. 
</P>
<P>
 With enormous pride, Murdock shows off his 6,000-square-foot, $3-million 
Georgia Colonial, a dwelling so true to his original vision he has refused to 
sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my favorite," he says, a sweeping staircase to his left and a lush green 
garden shining beyond arched windows of a richly appointed study. "The 
detailing is perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 From windowpanes to copper pipes to silk wallpapers, everything is 
custom-made. "But you can't do everything custom-made," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, over a rolling hill, in the shadow of a granite outcropping, at 
the 7th hole green, Murdock sees the future of his development -- a 
faint-yellow Cape Code with shuttered windows and wrap-around porches. It is 
4,800 square feet and sold quickly for $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not missing the granite," he says, waving at kitchen counters. "You 
couldn't have more beautiful floors than these," he says, standing on a rich 
cherry finish. "Not too tacky, is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The house is designed to customer specifications, now that there are some to 
listen to. The rooms are bigger, the windows are larger, the walk-in closets 
are cavernous. It is modern and open. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where we began to figure out where we are headed," Murdock says. 
"People said, 'I don't want all of that expensive stuff. You've got to get the 
house down if you want us in here.' So we changed."

SIMI CHIEF WINDS UP 1ST 100 DAYS WITH NO RUSH; POLICE: OFFICIAL TAKES SLOW, 
THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO JOB. BUT CRITICS SAY HE HAS BEEN ALL TALK, NO ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By all accounts, new Simi Valley Police Chief Willard R. Schlieter has spent 
much of his first 100 days in office doing just what he said he would do: 
</P>
<P>
 Listening. Studying and planning. Thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 As chief of police in the safest city of 100,000 or more in the United States, 
the 53-year-old transplant from Urbana, Ill., has time for reflection -- a 
luxury that new chiefs at harried departments in crime-ridden cities seldom 
enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 While theirs is a task of moving from one crisis to another, Schlieter's is 
one of fine-tuning an already respected and reasonably smooth-running 
department, Simi Valley officials and Schlieter's own officers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, privately, some of his officers say Schlieter (pronounced SHLY-ter) is 
taking too much time to act. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain of stagnation in his first 100 days, which end Wednesday, and 
they say they want the chief to take charge and give them some direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "From sergeants to lieutenants to secretaries, everybody's saying, 'He's been 
here three months, when's he going to do something?' " said Sgt. Gary Collins, 
president of the Simi Valley Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that he's had a chance to look at us, what needs to change? What's good? 
What's bad?" Collins said. "We're still waiting for a general consensus of 
where we are and where we should be." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first three months, Schlieter has been meeting regularly with city 
officials and union officials, low-level officers and top-level commanders, 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If talk leads to action, it's good," he said. "But if it doesn't, it's really 
frustrating."  
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said he refuses to be rushed into announcing any long-term plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see they're anxious to see something perhaps new and different," he 
said recently. "But it's premature of me to make that kind of announcement 
public without making sure we know where the department is going in the next 
three to five years." 
</P>
<P>
 The critics do not understand the job of organizing a department of this size, 
Schlieter said, reminding that he promised to move carefully when he first took 
office March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never came in and proposed an instant solution," he said. "Any manager 
would be foolish to make rash decisions based on emotions rather than fact." 
</P>
<P>
 On his first day at work, Schlieter faced some hard facts. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, the department's Cochran Street headquarters had been badly damaged 
by the Northridge earthquake. For another, two lieutenants' vacancies had been 
left unfilled amid a festering internal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 quake sank the building's east wing six inches into the ground, 
broke sprinkler pipes and split interior walls at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranks, from patrol officer to captain, were anxious to see the building 
fixed -- or, better yet, replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter squeezed meetings with architects and city planners in between 
briefings on his department's operations and its history of internal disputes, 
and pushed plans for a new headquarters onto the front burner. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two weeks from now, Schlieter said, the architect will deliver rough 
floor plans, including design suggestions from officers of all ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter also has had to clean up some bad blood between union members and 
management that developed last year during the tenure of his predecessor, Chief 
Lindsey Paul Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lieutenants' positions had been unfilled for months, and a sergeant who 
was promoted to one of them actually gave up his lieutenant's bars and dropped 
back to his old rank. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources inside the department have said the posts remained open because no one 
qualified wanted to work that close to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing this, the city advertised the lieutenants' slots to officers outside 
Simi Valley, which greatly angered local union officials and led to bickering 
between them and management. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some internal personality issues," conceded City Manager Lin 
Koester. "That's water under the bridge. We needed to identify what those 
issues are. We've identified them and understand them, and Mr. Schlieter is 
going to get an understanding of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Schlieter has already set the promotions back on track and begun 
shaking up some command assignments: Later this summer, about a dozen Simi 
Valley sergeants will test for the two lieutenant slots, and a dozen more 
officers are already vying for three vacant sergeant jobs, said Capt. Jerry 
Boyce. 
</P>
<P>
 And Schlieter said he plans to rotate the existing lieutenants through 
specialty assignments such as the Special Enforcement Detail, traffic division 
and administrative division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've announced to all the lieutenants that now's the time to make known to me 
the assignments they'd like," he said. "It's important to me to make these 
changes. We need to get focused on some issues, and it will help instill a 
little enthusiasm in people." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shake-up, he added: "We'll see other movement in the department." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Schlieter said he also plans to start hammering out the first 
comprehensive contract with the Simi Valley Police Officers Assn., as he did 
with union officials while he was chief of the Urbana Police Department. The 
Simi Valley union has existed for years on a two-page labor agreement and a 
series of rider letters addressing individual work issues. By September, 
Schlieter said, he hopes to have a memorandum of understanding worked out with 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
 The new chief said he also is studying ways to get his department even more 
plugged into the computer age. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said he has requested new laptop computers that will help detectives 
in the field save time by banging out reports that can be transferred instantly 
to the department's mainframe. He also has ordered software that will let 
police artists work with witnesses to generate quick computer sketches of crime 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is considering asking for city funds to install computer terminals in 
police cars, as he did in Urbana. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas like these will help the Simi Valley Police Department keep pace with 
the future, said Mayor Greg Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Police Department as an entity has got to recognize it's going to be a 
new world," Stratton said. "From my work (for a defense contractor), I know 
what the soldier of the future looks like and what the technology is capable of 
doing. . . . And as that technology becomes converted to civilian use, the 
logical first place for it is the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Koester said she is happy with Schlieter's work. "I plan on 
reviewing his performance about the first of July, and if things proceed as 
well as they have for the first three months, there'll be a 3% salary increase 
(for him)." Schlieter's marching orders were to study and modify the 
department's organizational structure, to examine labor relations and to 
scrutinize everything from policy to police cruisers -- and he has followed 
orders, Koester said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him to look at short-term and long-term plans, and I left it to him 
to define short- and long-term," Koester said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this circumspection has left Schlieter's officers hungry for some kind 
of action, said Collins, the union chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall feeling is we're adrift, but when you try to pin people down as 
to what they're talking about, they can't put it into words," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department still suffers from some internal conflicts between some 
officers and groups of employees, and Schlieter is not making the best use 
possible of individual officers' strengths, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short term, we're looking for him to put a stop to the internal 
problems and get us focused," Collins said. "And in the long term, we need him 
to tell us what the plan is." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jerry Boyce, who has served under both Schlieter and Miller, dismissed 
Collins' remarks as motivated by union politics, and the complaints from other 
officers as vague. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being idle, Schlieter has been working hard on the earthquake 
repairs, the new building plans, the openings for lieutenant and the command 
reassignments, Boyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's some heavy work for someone in their first 100 days that wasn't going 
to do a whole lot until he got a handle on things," Boyce said. "He is on top 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyce added: "Gary (Collins) really doesn't have a substantive complaint. . . 
. It's traditional that the union thinks the union can run the Police 
Department better than management can." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said steering Simi Valley's Police Department toward the 21st Century 
is not a rush job. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the great fuzzy question of what is the police officer of the future 
going to be," Stratton said. "Reorganization is what you do when you have a 
problem, and I don't think he's taken over a department with a problem. It may 
not be optimally structured for the next century, but I'd rather he take his 
time and restructure it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said that while he is making command decisions daily, he is still 
getting his bearings for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some periods of downtime, and I've had a lot of meetings," he said. 
"It's mostly self-imposed (downtime), and then I've had time to pull back and 
look inside myself and figure out where I'm going."

RESIDENTS TAKE A LOOK AT TRANSIT; DISCUSSION: SIX PEOPLE WHO USE VARIOUS MEANS 
TO GET AROUND ADDRESS A POSSIBLE SALES TAX, ROADS AND THEIR GENERAL CONCERNS ON 
LOCAL TRANSPORTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Grappling with the problems of maintaining Ventura County's roads, buses and 
trains keeps legions of bureaucrats busy with a seemingly endless list of of 
complex problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But for residents who simply need to get around in Ventura County, the 
concerns are more basic: Will the bus arrive on schedule? Are the Metrolink 
trains running on time? Are the roads congested -- and if so, where? How long 
will it take to get from Point A to Point B? What's the best route? Will 
leaving the car at home and hopping aboard the public transit system pay off? 
</P>
<P>
 And how much will it all cost? 
</P>
<P>
 For the county's voters, a larger question could loom in November: For the 
second time, they might be faced with the question of whether to approve a 
half-cent sales tax to fund transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, six residents who use a variety of means to get around discuss the sales 
tax, public transit, roads and their general concerns on transportation in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Patton Leaver, 38, of Moorpark. Leaver, a mortgage broker, drives every day to 
his job in Westlake.  
</P>
<P>
 Since I moved to Moorpark six years ago, I've seen the freeways in Ventura 
County become more crowded, more stressful, and generally more L.A.-like. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very distressing, but what I'm seeing is less considerate drivers and 
more accidents, especially on the 23 (Moorpark Freeway) and 101 (Ventura 
Freeway). 
</P>
<P>
 Something needs to be done to improve the freeways and cut down on the number 
of cars on the road. But I would not consider taking a bus unless it was much 
more convenient than it is now. It just takes too long. And half the time you 
can't get anywhere near where you want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had to choose between cutting funding for buses, trains or roads, I'd cut 
Metrolink. It can take years to build ridership on that kind of service, and we 
just don't have a dense enough population to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think a sales tax is the answer. Voting for a tax would be a real leap 
of faith. I just don't have a lot of trust in the way the funds already 
available are being used. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Regina Chavez, 16, of Ventura: During the school year, Regina takes the bus to 
St. Bonaventure High School, where she has just completed her sophomore year.  
</P>
<P>
 Right now I ride the bus every day, but I'm hoping to get a car soon, which 
will be a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
 I am concerned about smog and pollution. I'm in the environmental club at 
school and I've trained my family to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
 When I get a car, I'll be driving my brothers and sisters as well, so it will 
be like a car pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus isn't bad. I take it at the same time every day, so I know the driver 
and some of the other regular riders. Only sometimes weird people get on, and 
you just have to sit there and try to ignore them. Once I get a car, I'm not 
going to take the bus anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 My mom takes Metrolink and it's really expensive. So if I was old enough, I'd 
vote for a sales tax if it would bring the fares down. 
</P>
<P>
 I would not vote for a tax that would give more money to road work. It really 
bugs me when I see those road crews with 10 guys just standing around doing 
nothing. I think they could save a lot of money if they didn't have so many 
extra people out there. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sue Simms, 52, of Thousand Oaks: Simms works as a travel agent in downtown Los 
Angeles. She takes Metrolink to work every day.  
</P>
<P>
 I've lived in Thousand Oaks for 21 years and I would not have my job if it 
weren't for Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 When I applied last spring, my bosses said I lived too far away and that I 
would be crabby from sitting in traffic. But I told them about Metrolink and 
they hired me. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 2 1/2 hours I sit on the train each day I can do paperwork, sleep and 
meet people. I've met some really nice people on the train. I call them train 
mates or Metrolink mates. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink is expensive, and it makes my day a lot longer, but it helps people 
like me get from areas where there are no jobs to areas where they can find 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 I would definitely vote for a sales tax, if it would improve public 
transportation and get cars off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the train is a blessing, but buses aren't as important. The only way I 
would take the bus is if I didn't have a car. Except for work, I live close 
enough to the places I have to go that it's faster to get there by car. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 David Schachte, 37, of Camarillo: Schachte rides his bike to his job as an 
instructor at the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme.  
</P>
<P>
 I've been riding my bike to work every day for 10 years and I have no beef 
with the roads around here. The freeways are great and I'm pretty happy with 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 I ride everywhere: to Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Ojai and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 My main concern is that somebody might rear-end me, but I try to ride as 
carefully as possible to keep that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
 I would not support a sales tax. What do we need it for? I don't use public 
transportation and the roads look great to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I really have no need for the buses, but I did try to take Metrolink once. I 
was taking my daughter to Van Nuys for an 11:30 a.m. appointment. But the 
trains left at 6:30 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way I would take the train is if it ran during the day. The way it is 
now it doesn't do me any good. 
</P>

<P>
 Doris Young, 72, of Simi Valley: Young, whose vision is impaired by diabetes, 
has been unable to drive for about a year. She depends on Simi Valley's 
Dial-A-Ride service to get around.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dial-A-Ride concept is great, but in practice, it's really very hard to 
get around. 
</P>
<P>
 When I need to go somewhere, I have to plan well in advance. I call and put in 
a request for a pickup. Two or three days later they call back to tell me 
whether they can fit me in on the bus schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like it would be very simple for someone to keep a log so you could 
call them directly and they could tell you right away whether or not they could 
come and get you. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem I see is that those Dial-A-Ride vans carry 15 people, but 99% 
of the time I'm the only person on the bus when they come to get me. That seems 
like a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 I might vote for a sales tax, but I would be very skeptical about it. Since I 
rely on public transportation I would like to see the money used to improve it. 
</P>
<P>
 The roads seem just fine to me. If you have a car, you can handle a few 
potholes. But if there are no buses, people like me have no way to get around. 
</P>
<P>
 If I could drive, I would continue to drive. I would feel bad about the 
pollution, but I've already discovered how difficult it is to get anyplace on 
public transportation. 
</P>
<P>

 Virginia Boyles, 51, of Simi Valley: Boyles is a writer who lives in Simi 
Valley. She blames the death of her son, who was killed in a car crash last 
year, on Caltrans' removal of a stop sign at a freeway off-ramp.  
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, safety is uppermost in my mind. My son died because Caltrans 
removed a stop sign at a freeway off-ramp near Simi. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like if enough people complain, Caltrans will cave in and change 
things to make them less safe. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure Caltrans is concerned with safety, but I think their major concern is 
with expediting traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 I can tell you, it's much better to sit in traffic an extra 15 minutes and get 
home safely. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like there are a lot of people out there who don't think twice about 
safety. It makes the roads more dangerous than they should be. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm a typical Californian and I have a love affair with my car. It 
symbolizes my freedom and independence. I would not give it up to take 
Metrolink or the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as taxes go, I think we've been taxed to death and yet there never 
seems to be enough money. I would not vote for a sales tax for transportation. 
Getting Around in Ventura County 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has 277 miles of state highways and eight city bus systems, 
with a countywide bus service called Ventura Intercity Service Transit 
Authority, or VISTA, slated to start July 5. VISTA will link most cities in 
Ventura County for the first time, with unprecedented service to Point Mugu and 
Camarillo State Hospital. Commuter train service is offered on Metrolink's 
recently expanded Ventura County line, which includes stops in Oxnard, 
Camarillo, Moorpark and Simi Valley, before continuing to the San Fernando 
Valley and Downtwon Los Angeles. Traffic Projects 
</P>
<P>
 1) With the completion of the Simi Valley-Moorpark Freeway connector, traffic 
levels are expected to decrease in the 1994 report, due out in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 2) A project to widen California 118 and build a new Saticoy bridge is 
expected to reduce traffic. The project is scheduled for completion in August. 
Countywide Stats 
</P>
<P>
 Daily bus ridership: 9,700 
</P>
<P>
 Total average daily ridership on the eight bus services in Ventura County for 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily Metrolink ridership: 1,860 
</P>
<P>
 This is the average daily ridership for the month of April for the Oxnard, 
Camarillo, Moorpark and Simi stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Vehicles on the road per day: 542,000

VALLEY BRIEFING: HIGH SECURITY; SUBDUING RIOTING INMATES AT A COUNTY JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Through May 9 this year at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic there 
have been 52 "disturbances"--which is the official prison term for inmate 
fights. Although some have been between only two inmates, others have turned 
into brawls involving as many as 1,000 in numerous dormitories, according to 
Commander Robert Spierer, who oversees operations at the compound housing 
10,000 inmates in five facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the fights are strictly personal, arising out of arguments over the 
use of the telephone or changing the channel on the television. But the vast 
majority of the serious fights have been racially based, usually pitting 
Latinos against African Americans, according to the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, which oversees security at Pitchess. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing inmates in dormitories and barracks, as opposed to individual cells, 
has contributed to the seriousness of the fights because outbreaks are more 
difficult to control in open areas. And Spierer said that fights often come in 
series, much like an earthquake is followed by aftershocks. "A big disturbance 
is usually followed by a bunch of little disturbances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether a brawl involves two or 1,000 inmates, the policy in quelling the 
disturbance is to use the least amount of force necessary, Spierer said. The 
only deputies armed with lethal weapons are those in guard towers. When a 
Disturbance Breaks Out 
</P>
<P>
 Officials initiate a sequence of increasingly forceful measures: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Verbal Order: "Typically, a deputy will give a verbal order to those 
involved to return to their bunks," Spierer said. "In most cases, they comply." 
</P>
<P>
 2. Pepper Spray: If the order is ignored, the next step would be to use 
Oleoresin Capsicum, better known as pepper spray. The spray causes a burning 
sensation in the eyes, but does not cause permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Emergency Response Team: If the pepper spray is ineffective or its use 
would put a deputy in a dangerous situation, a supervisor is notified and an 
11-member emergency response team is activated. 
</P>
<P>
 * The deputies equip themselves with face shields, protective vests and 
batons. 
</P>
<P>
 * One deputy is armed with a .37-millimeter ARWEN gun that shoots a 3-ounce, 
2- to 3-inch plastic projectile that delivers a blow to the chest. "It will 
cause a bruise and knock down the individual, but it is less likely to cause 
any permanent damage," Spierer said.  
</P>
<P>
 * Stinger cartridges: Another deputy is armed with a .37-millimeter launcher 
that shoots "stinger" cartridges. There are two types of cartridges. One is 5 
inches long and contains 140 rubber pellets, the other is 8 inches long and 
contains 220 pellets. 
</P>
<P>
 - The pellets cause a "stinging" feeling on impact. 
</P>
<P>
 - The stinger cartridges create a controlled pattern of pellet dispersion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stinger grenades: For a wider dispersion of the pellets, deputies also have 
stinger grenades. The grenades are rubber balls containing an explosive charge 
which disperses 180 pellets in a circular 50-foot radius. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Lockdown: When a disturbances breaks out, a "lockdown" is immediately 
implemented to stop all inmate movement, Spierer said. Instead of the 
individual cells commonly associated with a jail, the compound has dormitories 
and barracks housing from 50 to 140 inmates each. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, 365 inmates have been injured as a result of the 
disturbances, but only about 10% required hospitalization. Four deputies have 
been injured, none seriously. COMPARING 1994 WITH 1993 03,35,17,18 1994 1993 
(Through May 9) (for whole year) Inmates incarcerated: 10,000 10,000 Number of 
disturbances: 52 57 Inmates involved in disturbances: 3,800 5,500 Inmates 
injured: 365 443 Deputies injured: 4 16 Deaths (deputies or 0 0 inmates) from

CAR HITS AND KILLS MOTHER, INJURES CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 87-year-old driver who had slowed down to allow a mother and 7-year-old 
daughter to cross the street in front of the child's school instead crashed 
into the pair when his foot slipped off the brake pedal and onto the 
accelerator, killing the mother and injuring the girl, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Najat Azouri, 44, of Van Nuys and her daughter, Paula, stepped in between two 
parked cars in front of Valerio Street Elementary school at about 2:15 p.m. 
Friday, according to Officer Jimmy Chong of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Fenton, 87, also of Van Nuys, was headed west on Valerio Street when he 
noticed the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 After slowing down, Chong said, Fenton's foot slipped onto the accelerator. 
Fenton, driving a 1974 Dodge Dart, collided with the pedestrians and dragged 
them both about 40 feet while "numerous" horrified children and parents looked 
on, Chong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chong said there would not be charges filed against Fenton because the Azouris 
were crossing about 140 feet away from the nearest crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was fine, he was sober, his vehicle was in good condition, his brakes 
worked," Chong said. "He was released at the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Najat Azouri was pronounced dead at 3:33 p.m. at Valley Presbyterian Hospital. 
Paula was in stable condition at UCLA Medical Center with lacerations to her 
forehead and multiple abrasions.

FESTIVAL'S VOICES JOIN IN HARMONY FOR PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP; COMMUNITY SPIRIT: 
GATHERING AT MISSION COLLEGE SEEKS A PLEDGE FROM PARTICIPANTS THAT THEY WILL 
WORK TO QUELL THE VIOLENCE RAVAGING L.A. AND THE WORLD AT LARGE.

<P>
 A rally for peace at Mission College in Sylmar may have had a small turnout, 
but although the field the speakers were addressing may have been nearly empty, 
their hopes were not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year I can see this field covered with thousands of people," said Larry 
E. Grant, one of the speakers at the Harmony/Unity Festival on Saturday 
afternoon, which included food, music and speeches about how to bring people 
together and end violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Each person who attended the rally was asked to sign a personal pledge to 
"extend my hand in peace and friendship to my fellow human being." Organizers 
had hoped for a large turnout Saturday, but just a handful of people had 
arrived by early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmony Coalition was founded in December by Arthur Stevens, a financial 
services salesman, who said at the rally, "About a year ago it looked like the 
whole world was disintegrating" because of violence throughout Los Angeles and 
the world. He formed the coalition to make a difference and opened up a food 
bank in Chatsworth in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Each pledge signed Saturday was a "vote for change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who attended the rally spoke highly of Stevens and his effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in his cause," said Evelyn Perez, a teacher at Sylmar Elementary 
School, who talked about the fear she felt when her son, who goes to Olive 
Vista Middle School, once came home talking about a shooting that happened 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see someone working so hard to bring people together, I want to make 
time to be here for him," said Perez, who brought her daughter, Nanette, to the 
rally. "We need to have more peaceful events." 
</P>
<P>
 After signing the pledge of peace and friendship, each person was also given a 
gold ribbon, which was pinned on their shirts to symbolize angels, indicating a 
desire to make the city into a true "City of Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Leland Stewart, with the Los Angeles-based Unity-and-Diversity World Council, 
an organization that promotes understanding, was especially glad to speak at 
the peace rally because he lives in Mar Vista, near the recent gang shootings 
in Venice. Despite the violence, which he said is a symptom of the period of 
transition the world is in, Stewart was optimistic about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religions are waking up and working together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassie Jones, a neighbor of Stevens in Chatsworth who said she has watched 
Stevens planning the rally for months, said that although the rally was small, 
it was still important. "I think it starts here with us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loraine Landeros of Canoga Park came to the rally worried about her two

rather than the gang violence in which some youths are involved. "The kids who 
do good things should be on television," she said.

2 DIE, CHILD HURT WHEN TRUCK CRASHES INTO RIVER BASIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man and a woman were killed and a child was injured early Saturday morning 
when all three were thrown from their truck after it jumped a guardrail on the 
Hollywood Freeway and landed in the Los Angeles River basin, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasha Chmielinski, 3 1/2, who authorities said is the woman's daughter, was in 
fair condition late Saturday at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead were identified as Rafael Perez, 33, of Panorama City and Neisha 
Chmielinski, 24, of La Crescenta, according to a coroner's department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims apparently were not wearing safety belts, said California Highway 
Patrol spokesman Frank Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 2:45 a.m., when Perez, traveling southbound on the 
Hollywood Freeway in the truck, attempted to merge onto the eastbound Ventura 
Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Perez was speeding, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going too fast, so he slides to the right and hits the guardrail," 
Lewis said. "Then he over-corrects, and crosses back over all four lanes to the 
left and hits the opposite guardrail." 
</P>
<P>
 After slamming into the second guardrail, the truck flipped over the side of 
the freeway, hit a tree and landed upside-down in the river basin, about 50 
feet below the freeway, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash tore off the truck's fiberglass shell, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics pronounced Perez and Neisha Chmielinski dead at the scene, said Los 
Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasha, who was found near her mother, told rescuers that another child had 
also been ejected in the crash, but authorities were unable to find anyone, 
Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After an extensive search, it was determined that there was no other child, 
that (Kasha) was simply delirious," Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident closed the eastbound Ventura Freeway at the interchange with the 
Hollywood Freeway for about an hour, Lewis said.

MANNES ARRESTED ON SUSPECTED PAROLE VIOLATION; CRIME: POLICE SAY SOMIS WOMAN 
HAD BEEN DRINKING. LAST YEAR, SHE PLEADED GUILTY TO KILLING 3 IN DRUNK-DRIVING 
ACCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Diane Helen Mannes, who killed three young men in a drunk-driving accident 
five years ago, was arrested early Saturday for violating her parole after 
sheriff's deputies found her under the influence of alcohol in a parked car, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes, whose widely publicized case went as high as the U.S. Supreme Court, 
was found in possession of alcoholic beverages and under the influence of 
alcohol in a car at Pleasant Valley Park in Camarillo about 2:30 a.m., 
sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Somis woman pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the deaths last August and 
was given five years probation with a three-year, eight-month suspended prison 
term. She could face up to three years and eight months in state prison for the 
parole violation, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin G. DeNoce. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of her key terms of probation was abstaining from alcohol," DeNoce said. 
"We see it as one of the most serious violations she could have committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Oxenreider, whose 19-year-old son, Joshua, was one of the men killed in 
the 1989 accident, expressed frustration and anger over Mannes' alleged parole 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly hope at this point they will put her in prison," she said. "I 
want them to put her back in now before she kills another person. I don't know 
how much more it's going to take. Isn't three dead boys enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 After sheriff's deputies discovered Mannes sitting in a parked car with an 
unidentified man Saturday morning, they contacted her parole officer, who 
requested that they arrest her for violating parole, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were aware of who she was and knew she was prohibited from drinking," 
Lt. Gary Markley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of Mannes' probation stipulate that she abstain from drinking and 
attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 Mannes, 39, was recently accused of violating her probation for failing to 
attend AA meetings and doctoring attendance sheets to hide her absence. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, her parole officer was preparing an amendment to the violation 
notice because Mannes still was not attending the meetings, DeNoce said.  
</P>
<P>
 The probation-violation case is scheduled for a hearing on June 23 in Ventura 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 DeNoce said he intends to include Mannes' latest violation in that case and 
hopes Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. will send her to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the alcohol violation, I'm very confident that she is going to go back 
to state prison," DeNoce said. "She's clearly demonstrated that she's not a 
candidate for probation." 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes is being held in Ventura County Main Jail until her parole officer 
approves her release, jail and sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1989, three young men were killed and two injured when Mannes' car 
swerved onto the shoulder of the Ventura Freeway on the Conejo Grade. The 
teen-agers were seeking help for a flat tire when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-empty bottle of vodka was found in Mannes' car. It was later reported 
that she had been arrested the night before on a drunk-driving charge in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Mannes served about two years in prison for a felony drunk-driving conviction 
she received for injuring the two young men. But the jury deadlocked on three 
counts of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal court blocked prosecutors from retrying the case, saying a trial 
judge's comment that there was insufficient evidence to support a murder 
verdict constituted an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors sought to try Mannes on gross vehicular manslaughter charges after 
a federal appeals court upheld the court's decision and the U.S. Supreme Court 
refused to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Ventura County Superior Court judge ruled in February, 1993, that she 
could not be charged with manslaughter because it constituted double jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 While the district attorney's office was waiting for a decision on its appeal, 
Mannes agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter, provided she serve no more time 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxenreider, now president of the Ventura County chapter of Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving, said she was not surprised by Mannes' arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was coming," she said. "She was hardly on probation less than eight 
months before she started missing meetings. . . .I knew she wasn't going to 
make it. She's never shown any remorse and I don't think she thought she had an 
alcohol problem."

OXNARD MAN FOUND DEAD IN SHOOTING AT HIS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Homicide investigators are looking for clues in the death of an Oxnard man who 
was shot in his home, an Oxnard Police Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricardo Gonzales, 38, was shot once in the chest about 10:30 p.m. Friday and 
died almost instantly, a Ventura County coroner's spokesman said.A police 
report said he was shot with a large-caliber weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors called police after Gonzales' family members frantically knocked on 
doors looking for help, a resident of the apartment complex said.  
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office spokesman said Gonzales is survived by his wife and at 
least one son, but neighbors said Gonzales -- who they said had recently moved 
to the area -- had at least four children.  
</P>
<P>
 Family members returned to the apartment early Saturday morning to retrieve 
belongings, a neighbor said, and then left to stay with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not identified any suspects or determined a motive in the 
shooting, a police spokesman said.

CAR CRASH LINKED TO BIRD CROSSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Simi Valley drivers were injured in a traffic accident that police say was 
caused when one of the drivers stopped to allow a covey of quail to cross the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirsten Lawrence, 26, and Jessica Vanderck, 22, were slightly injured in the 
accident that occurred about 3 p.m. Friday when Vanderck rear-ended Lawrence, 
who had stopped her car in the northbound lane of Erbes Road to allow the birds 
to pass, a Ventura County sheriff's deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the car with Lawrence were her 7-year-old and 1-year-old daughters, as well 
as the family dog, the spokesman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence and Vanderck were taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center, where 
they were treated for minor injuries and released, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 No citations were issued, and the quail were unharmed.

FRENZY BUILDS AS WORLD CUP DATES DRAW NEAR; SOCCER: NEIGHBORHOODS -- ESPECIALLY

 When the black-and-white checkered ball kicked by a member of the Mexican 
national soccer team sails into the opponents' goal, Victor Ramos jumps for 
joy.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ramos family, with a satellite dish perched on the roof of their Boyle 
Heights home, is dedicated to watching games being played in their native 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there is a score, we all get excited," Ramos, 26, said. "Even my mom 
doesn't know all the players, but she will criticize them when they do 
something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 By this time next week, Ramos' beloved Mexican national team will be playing 
on American soil -- Chicago -- and competing for the World Cup soccer 
championship. And Ramos and his family will be gathered in front of his 
television, cheering them on.  
</P>
<P>
 Soccer mania, which has much of Los Angeles brimming with excitement, is here. 
As the fever spreads, neighborhoods throughout the area -- especially those 
with large immigrant populations -- are preparing for an onslaught of 
soccer-crazed fans who will converge on Los Angeles for the World Cup, which 
begins Saturday and ends next month with the championship game at the Rose 
Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 For immigrants from Latin American countries, where soccer is king and almost 
everybody grows up playing on improvised fields, their passion for the world's 
most popular sport is approaching a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ramos, who was booting a soccer ball around by himself at the Boyle 
Heights Sports Center Park one afternoon last week, the World Cup is a reminder 
of the early passion he developed for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad used to take me to this field as a child," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer obsession is also evident in communities where street vendors sell 
World Cup T-shirts alongside mangoes. At Niky's Sports shop in Westlake, 
autographed posters of soccer greats such as Pele, and Colombian, German, Dutch 
and Brazilian flags have helped make the small store an unofficial gathering 
place for impromptu soccer discussions and remarkable displays of devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a fever . . . this is practically a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity to see the World Cup," said Niky Orellana, owner of the shop and a 
soccer commentator on radio station KORG. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is something powerful," Orellana said. "You see people around here who 
stop by my store and they say they'll get down on their knees and beg for a 
ticket. Now, that's a sign of how hooked (Latinos) are to soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Granados, a Monrovia resident, visited Niky's shop last week to round out 
his soccer wardrobe with a white jacket that makes clear he is an ardent 
supporter of Brazil's team. Granados and 17 of his friends were getting ready 
to drive to San Diego for an exhibition game between Brazil and Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never able to host a World Cup in my country," said Granados, an 
immigrant from El Salvador. "And this may be my first and last chance to see 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the heated discussions over the merits of the participating teams that 
are common among fans, the World Cup has generated a good-natured rivalry 
within the Granados family. Jose's brother Salvador supports the United States 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a U.S. citizen so I'm backing them, but we both just love to see a good 
game and in that respect it doesn't matter," Salvador Granados said as he 
purchased more than a dozen patches featuring flags of countries participating 
in the games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but he still wants the U.S. to win," said Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by posters of soccer superstars such as Argentina's Diego Maradona, 
Mexico's Hugo Sanchez and Colombia's Carlos Alberto Valderama, the two brothers 
pour over schedules of games, maps and tickets in Orellana's store. 
</P>
<P>
 For Raul Rodriguez, the World Cup frenzy is measured in shoes. Rodriguez, 22, 
an employee of Jumping Shoes on Pacific Boulevard in Huntington Park, has seen 
sales of cleated footwear increase with the rising interest in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have sold more if we could get more" on the shelves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoe store has capitalized on the commercial potential of the World Cup by 
featuring six or seven models of soccer shoes in its most prominent display 
position by the front door. Rodriguez said that interest in the world-class 
World Cup translates to interest in world-class shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want these $30 shoes; they are too cheap," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 There are other ways to measure the World Cup's commercial potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the games are sure to focus the world's attention on Los Angeles, a 
variety of local groups are planning celebrations to improve the area's image 
as well as attract tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate merchants held a street festival earlier this month dedicated to 
hyping the World Cup; this weekend, Huntington Park will hold its own parade, 
complete with the World Cup mascot, Striker. The Los Angeles Convention Center 
will be the site of a soccer festival that promises instructional clinics, 
merchandise and food July 8-17.  
</P>
<P>
 Also in conjunction with the games, the nonprofit Watts Friendship Sports 
League said it will be handing out World Cup tickets to inner-city youths later 
this month, as well as helping refurbish a field in Nickerson Gardens in Watts, 
said George Wolfberg, of the league.  
</P>
<P>
 At 3rd Street between Bixel Street and Lucas Avenue, a temporary soccer field 
will be opened later this month that will serve as many as 3,500 youths a week. 
To promote the city and the sport, the Tourism Industry Development Council, a 
nonprofit group formed last December, is promoting tours of Central, 
South-Central and East Los Angeles for the international media in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to demonstrate the positive (aspects) of these communities, said 
Billi Romain, project manager for the council.

NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM STIRS FEARS HERE; FOREIGN RELATIONS: THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT WEAPONS ARE BEING DEVELOPED ON THE PENINSULA PRODUCES ANXIETY 
AMONG KOREAN AMERICANS. THE WORRIES ARE FED BY MEMORIES OF WAR AND A CONCERN 
FOR LOVED ONES OVERSEAS.

 Daily reports about efforts by the United States to curb North Korea's feared 
nuclear weapons program may be a distant drumbeat for many, but for Angelenos 
of Korean descent, the news stirs deep anxieties fed by memories of war and 
concern for loved ones on the Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 A front-page headline in the June 4 edition of the Korea Times on the Korean 
American community's reaction to the dispute summed it up: "Koreans Can't Hide 
Their Uneasiness." 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are calling me and asking if it's OK to send their kids to summer 
programs in Seoul," said Tom Byun, the paper's senior editor. "Travel agents 
are worried about a decrease in tourism to South Korea. People who have 
relatives in North or South Korea are worried. They all feel the tension." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the United States stepped up its campaign to force North Korea to 
allow inspections of its nuclear facilities in an effort to determine whether 
material has been diverted from a power plant for the production of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio reporter Hye Shin Kang of FM Seoul (KFOX 93.5) said many Korean 
Americans are troubled by the mainstream media's coverage of the topic, which 
some in the community have criticized as overheated. "People's feelings about 
what's going to happen waver, depending on what they read or hear," Kang said. 
"We try to calm them down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Hee Min Park, senior pastor of Young Nak Presbyterian Church, said 
the situation on the Korean peninsula is "the top issue of discussion and 
prayer" for many of the 7,000 members of his largely Korean congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Byun said when he talks to relatives and fellow journalists in South 
Korea, he gets a different message. "In (South) Korea, it's pretty calm and 
normal. I think they are used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 For Koreans, getting used to tension is an unfortunate consequence of having 
had to live with it for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by larger, more powerful countries, Korea has always been caught up 
in the swirl of international politics. A Korean proverb puts it this way: 
"Shrimps' backs are broken in a whale fight." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1910, Japan annexed Korea and ruled it as a colony until Japan's defeat in 
World War II. The plan drawn up by U.S. officials in 1945 to accept the 
surrender of the Japanese army in Korea allowed the Soviet Union to occupy the 
northern half of the peninsula while the Americans occupied the southern half. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that temporary division solidified and led to the development of 
separate regimes in the north and south. The Korean War of 1950 to 1953 
devastated the divided peninsula and left millions separated from their 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Korean War is the starting point of the psyche of Korean people today," 
said Eui-Young Yu, professor of sociology at Cal State Los Angeles. "Most 
Korean Americans have someone in their family who was killed, or disappeared or 
was somehow affected by the war." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, no one wants to contemplate another war. "I don't want to hear 
people talk about what the percentages are for a war," said Steve SungGill 
Chang, president of the Korean Federation of Los Angeles. "It's time for 
dialogue. We need to explore other diplomatic options. Economic sanctions 
should be a final step." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in two recent conferences, one sponsored by the Korea Society/Los 
Angeles and the RAND Center for Asia-Pacific Policy and the other by the Korean 
Youth and Student Union and eight other organizations, also promoted 
negotiation and compromise as the way to ease tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite past disappointments, many Korean Americans maintain confidence in the 
U.S. government's ability to handle the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get frustrated when we hear about how North Korea is behaving, but there's 
nothing we can do about it," said Jiun Shin, a mental health nurse at the Asian 
Pacific Counseling and Treatment Center.  
</P>
<P>
 The center has had no requests for counseling related to the international 
dispute, Shin said. But Yu sees the situation as one more crisis beyond the 
control of weary Koreans in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a community that is psychologically down" since the 1992 riots, in 
which 2,000 Korean-owned businesses were damaged, Yu said. "People have lost 
businesses and homes and are losing their health. . . . If there's a war, all 
Koreans will be the losers."  
</P>
<P>
 Yu said his daughter, a graduate student in Seoul, told him not to worry. "She 
said she keeps in touch with the U.S. embassy and they have evacuation plans 
all worked out. I hope things don't get to that point."

VILLARAIGOSA POISED TO WIN ASSEMBLY SEAT; POLITICS: VICTORY BY LONGTIME 
COMMUNITY ACTIVIST IN PRIMARY VIRTUALLY ASSURES HIM OF ELECTION IN THE HEAVILY 
DEMOCRATIC 45TH DISTRICT. INCUMBENTS BREEZE PAST CHALLENGERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After winning a bitter primary campaign for a Northeast Assembly district, 
Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa is poised to move on to Sacramento after 
November's general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The longtime community activist fended off a last-minute negative mailing 
attack to win the Democratic nomination in the 45th Assembly District in the 
most closely watched primary in Central Los Angeles last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this victory was a reflection of the broad coalition of voters across 
racial and ethnic lines and a real return to grass-roots organizing," 
Villaraigosa said. "That was the margin of victory here." 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents breezed to victory in Tuesday's area congressional and legislative 
races, and the son of a veteran legislator won a close race for an open seat in 
a Southwest 47th Assembly District. In a vacant seat in the 22nd state Senate 
District, an underfunded and relatively unknown candidate making her first run 
for public office captured nearly 41% of the vote against a veteran legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 45th District, Villaraigosa collected 49.6% of the vote to Bill Mabie's 
33.3%. Villaraigosa will face Republican Robert K. Jung and Libertarian Pam 
Probst in the November general election. He is virtually assured of victory 
because Democrats make up 62% of the district's voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts say that Mabie, who entered the race late, was unable to 
overcome Villaraigosa's name recognition, 2-to-1 fund-raising advantage and 
well-oiled campaign apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa, 41, who was born and raised in the area, stressed his 25 years 
of community work ranging from union activism to voter registration. His 
campaign had attracted dozens of area activists whose skills were honed in 
movements such as the successful effort to legalize street vending in Los 
Angeles and unionize janitors in local hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie, 32, is chief of staff for Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), 
who is vacating the 45th District seat to run for the opening in the 22nd 
Senate Distict. A one-time registered Republican, Mabie touted his community 
work and knowledge of the legislative process. 
</P>
<P>
 The district stretches from Highland Park to Boyle Heights, including Mount 
Washington, Silver Lake, Echo Park and parts of Hollywood. Latinos make up 63% 
of the district's 370,000 residents but only 36% of its 83,311 registered 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The area has been the site of a decade of bitter contests between candidates 
representing a group headed by county Supervisor Gloria Molina and a competing 
faction headed by Polanco and Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre. 
This year's race was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa, backed by Molina, had accused Mabie and Polanco of maliciously 
spreading rumors that he was arrested in 1977 for a felony assault stemming 
from an attack by a man against his mother during a melee at a local 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa was initially arrested on a felony assault in that case, 
according to Los Angeles police records obtained by The Times. However, he was 
tried on a misdemeanor assault charge and was not convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final days before the primary, the Villaraigosa camp accused Mabie of 
sending mailers quoting out-of-context information about his arrest record that 
was published in a Times article. The consultant who designed the mailer, 
Richard Ross, defended it as fair comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The election also had taken on racial overtones, with some Latino politicians 
upset that Polanco had endorsed Mabie, who is white, for a seat that has been 
held by Latinos since 1972. Polanco, who sent out a last-minute mailer urging 
the district's Latino voters to support Mabie, responded that he was merely 
backing the candidate he viewed as best suited for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 47th Assembly District, attorney Kevin Murray won a tight battle in the 
Democratic primary. Murray, the son of veteran Assemblyman Willard W. Murray 
Jr. (D-Paramount), captured 21.2% of the vote. Congressional aide Ed Johnson 
and teacher and union activist Jimmie Woods Gray both had 16.9%. Attorney Geoff 
Gibbs followed with 16.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Democrats sought the seat being vacated by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore 
(D-Los Angeles), who lost her bid for secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavily Democratic district was drawn to favor the election of an African 
American. It stretches from Mid-City through Baldwin Hills and Ladera Heights. 
In the GOP primary, businessman Jonathan Leonard got 57.2% of the vote to beat 
attorney Kathleen L. Brundo. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 22nd Senate District, former legislative aide Yolanda Gonzalez made a 
strong showing against a well-financed Polanco. She captured 40.6% of the vote 
to Polanco's 59.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco had raised $172,949 to Gonzalez's $20,000. Much of the area includes 
Polanco's current Assembly district, which he has represented since 1986. The 
district stretches from Highland Park through Echo Park and Silver Lake to 
South-Central, including parts of the Eastside, Mid-City and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political consultants said Gonzalez's strong performance showed that a 
number of voters were dissatisfied with Polanco and signals that he should be 
vulnerable in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a major warning shot across Richard Polanco's bow," said 
consultant Parke Skelton, who has backed candidates opposed by Polanco. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco did not return calls for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Republican Ron T. Lee was unopposed in his primary, as was Libertarian Vincent 
Way and Peace and Freedom candidate Pearl Wolff. 
</P>

FANS KICK INTO HIGH GEAR FOR COLOMBIA'S WORLD CUP TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colombia, mi equipo, eres el mejor, puedes meter goles, todo con valor . 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cheer for Colombia's World Cup team 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three months, these chants have echoed through the dance halls of 
Candilejas nightclub in Hollywood:  
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia, my team, you are the best/You will score goals, all of them with 
zest (courage)." 
</P>
<P>
 Fists clasping yellow, blue and red pompons punch up, down, in and out as hips 
jolt in unison to the tempo of the cheer. The slogan is voiced by 10 Colombian 
American women called the Porristas Colombianas -- the Colombian Cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, yes, high schools and colleges, certainly. But cheerleaders for a 
national soccer team? Unheard of, even by American standards.  
</P>
<P>
 But such is the power of the world's most popular sport. The Porristas are one 
example of how soccer mania has reached a fever pitch as the World Cup draws 
closer to its opening games in Pasadena and around the United States on 
Saturday. The cheerleaders' enthusiastic support for the national team matches 
that of thousands of Colombian zealots flocking to Los Angeles from all over 
the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Credencial magazine, which cites studies on the World Cup's impact on local 
economies, calculates that between 9,000 and 10,000 Colombians will travel to 
the United States for the Cup. Area aficionados will either watch their team 
firsthand or view the matches on television at home or at local bars and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia, with its flashy stars Asprilla and Carlos Valderrama, is among the 
favorites in the 24-team tournament. The country's emergence as a world soccer 
power has inspired excitement in fans inside and outside the South American 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere is going to boil in Los Angeles," says Dora Sanchez, the 
mother of three of the cheerleaders and the affectionately titled godmother of 
the squad.  
</P>
<P>
 The group, after a false start, formed in March and began practicing its dance 
routines mixed with original chants and the rah-rah cheers familiar to American 
sports followers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Porristas, whose average age is 25, all were born in Colombia, immigrated 
to the United States and have become residents in all areas of the Los Angeles 
Basin. Porristas Adriana Cardenas, her sister, Vicky, and Soraya Gomez are from 
South Gate.  
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in the same colors as the Colombian flag, the group hopes to perform 
on the sidelines of the Rose Bowl, where the team makes its debut against 
Romania on Saturday. Colombia's second match is against the United States on 
June 22. They have asked authorization from Colombian and Cup officials but 
have yet to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the women have performed three times for club patrons. They 
are scheduled to perform their routine at Candilejas at midnight on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people watch us perform they applaud as if they were watching the 
national (soccer) team," says Adriana Cardenas as other team members concur in 
laughter.  
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that the Porristas will attend at least one World Cup match, Romeo 
Linares, owner of Candilejas, gave the cheering squad tickets for the 
USA-Colombia match on June 22, where they can cheer from Section 17.  
</P>
<P>
 The thousands of fervent, globe-hopping Colombian fans hitting Los Angeles are 
filling not only hotels but the homes of local residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Armand (Capitan) Echeverria, owner of the Panamericana travel agency chain, 
said his Glendale home "has been invaded with people, many of whom are going to 
have to sleep on the floor." Echeverria said he is hosting 11 compatriots, 
including four priests and one bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Buitrago, known by friends as "El Abuelo Pachanguero" -- roughly 
translated as "The Partying Grandpa" for his music business and work as a 
deejay -- plans to close his store for the U.S.-Colombia match.  
</P>
<P>
 "In my case, I want Colombia to win. But I've been here for many years and I 
want to pull for the United States all the way also. It puts me on the spot."

POP MUSIC; MR. MELTING POT; USING HIS LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN HERITAGE AS A 
SPRINGBOARD TO MULTICULTURAL MUSIC, SINGER JON SECADA IS REALIZING HIS 
CROSSOVER DREAMS WHILE PROMOTING INTEGRATION 'BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS 
ABOUT' 
</P>

<P>
 The business of being Jon Secada is being conducted today on Stage 14 at NBC's 
Burbank studios, where the 32-year-old Afro Cuban American singer is taping 
"The Tonight Show With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Secada -- who blasted out of nowhere in 1992 with a debut album 
that has sold 6 million worldwide and a Grammy-winning Spanish-language 
counterpart that has sold another 400,000 -- will perform the hit single from 
his new album, "Heart, Soul & a Voice," for the NBC late-night show "Friday 
Night." After that, there's a "meet and greet" with fans who won a "Meet Jon 
Secada" contest. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, there are pictures to be taken, grateful-sounding thanks to be 
murmured, flesh to be pressed. 
</P>
<P>
 After that . . . well, after that, Jon Secada -- handsome, soft-spoken, genial 
Jon Secada -- would be forgiven for bouncing off the walls in his room at Le 
Parc Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that that's likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a workaholic," Secada says with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never complains," says his agent, Jorge Pinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sings from the heart," says his manager, producer and mentor, Emilio 
Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
 The business of being Jon Secada is especially big business because Secada -- 
as pop singer, songwriter and performer -- appeals both to the U.S. mainstream 
pop audience and the nation's estimated 22 million Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spanish-speaking people are probably going to be the biggest-growing market 
in the States," says Estefan, a Cuban immigrant (like Secada) whose other major 
client, wife Gloria Estefan, has already carved out a lucrative English-Spanish 
singing career. 
</P>
<P>
 While Secada's first album, the 1992 "Jon Secada," buoyed by the huge hit 
"Just Another Day," scored with mainstream Anglo audiences, the 
Spanish-language counterpart, "Otro Dia Mas Sin Verte," spawned four No. 1 
singles on Billboard's Latin chart and bagged a Grammy for best Latin pop 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 Secada also walked away with best male artist, best new artist and best album 
in the pop category at last year's Premio Lo Nuestro a La Musica Latina, the 
prestigious Latin equivalent to the Grammys. What's more, a sizable number of 
English-speaking Anglos appear to have bought "Otro Dia Mas." 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day," Secada says, "Anglos tell me that they might not understand 
what I'm singing, but there's immediately more passion in the Spanish versions 
of the songs." 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot of all this cross-cultural pollination: Barely 2 1/2 years into his 
career, Secada has emerged as an enormous star both in the States and in Latin 
America. (Not to mention Europe, Africa and Asia -- his label, SBK Records, 
says Secada's first album was a hit in 20 countries.) 
</P>
<P>
 Critical acceptance has not come so smoothly. Secada's first album was written 
off by critics as facile adult-contemporary popcraft. Some mainstream reviews 
for "Heart, Soul & a Voice" have been more positive, but he's still often 
faulted for writing unashamedly radio-ready material. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' Don Heckman, praising Secada's voice as "one of the most flexible . 
. . in pop," concludes that the dance-pop orientation of the new album doesn't 
suit the singer. "Secada has the talent to become a big-time crossover act but 
on this he doesn't get much opportunity to show it," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The same doubts exist among Latin music critics, who generally marvel at his 
commercial success but dismiss his artistic value. 
</P>
<P>
 Among record buyers, though, about the only demographic Secada hasn't 
conquered here is the African American audience, and he and his record company 
are going after it with a vengeance with the new "Heart, Soul & a Voice." The 
collection entered the U.S. pop album charts two weeks ago at No. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, which Secada says is a truer reflection of his muse than the debut 
package, pulses with the sweet, sexy grooves of Earth, Wind & Fire, Marvin Gaye 
and other R&B titans that the singer, the son of black and Latino exiles from 
Cuba, favored while growing up in Hialeah, Fla., the largely Latino 
working-class community north of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the last album, urban radio really wasn't there," says Secada, whose grasp 
of record industry marketing-speak is every bit as fluent as his English and 
Spanish. "But this record, yeah, it's pop, but the flavors are definitely R&B. 
The first song, 'If You Go,' already got accepted by urban radio. I really want 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Hispanic," he adds, "but I'm also African. My roots are just as African 
as any black person who was born here. I consider myself a big melting pot of 
different cultures, which I want to attest to in my music -- kind of talk about 
integration and promote it, because that's what America is about." 
</P>
<P>
 Secada realizes his crossover dreams, however earnestly articulated, could be 
construed as a shameless marketing ploy. "That was definitely a fear," he 
acknowledges. "But so far, the comments are that the stuff is genuine and 
sincere. It's not that this is put on because I'm trying to market myself in a 
certain way. The music speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Secada might still be an unknown in Miami were it not for the Berry Gordy-like 
ministrations of Emilio Estefan, a tireless promoter of the city's rich Cuban 
American talent base. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, Estefan leveraged the Latin-inflected dance hits of his 
band, Miami Sound Machine, into a pop-music cottage industry. At its center was 
MSM lead singer Gloria Estefan, who would later reposition herself as a 
bilingual pop star, setting the crossover precedent for Secada to exploit a 
decade later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Secada, freshly graduated from the University of Miami with a 
master's degree in jazz singing, was teaching at Miami-Dade Community College 
and playing bar mitzvahs. His ambitions, he admits, didn't extend much beyond 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horizon for me was to be a working musician, which I was," Secada says. 
"Teaching, sessions, nightclubs, whatever. I had a house and I was making a 
good living. No problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Then college acquaintances of Secada who were members of Miami Sound Machine 
gave his demo tape to Emilio Estefan. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the beginning," Secada says. "At the time, Emilio really wanted 
someone besides Gloria to represent and manage -- a Miami talent, somebody 
bilingual." 
</P>
<P>
 Estefan spent five years grooming his protege, immersing Secada in every 
aspect of the record business, from production to songwriting. "He didn't rush 
it," Secada says. "He wanted me to start out getting my feet wet, learn about 
the business, slowly develop a name and a reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 In due course, Secada proved his mettle by co-writing two No. 1 singles for 
Gloria Estefan -- "Coming Out of the Dark" and "Can't Forget You." He joined 
her 1991 world tour as a backup singer and was given a featured solo spot in 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gloria wanted to help him," Emilio Estefan says. " 'What can I do to help 
this guy to cross over?' It was a great way to show people who Jon Secada was." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the Estefans' munificence, Secada had performed in front of 5 
million people in five countries before scoring a record deal of his own. 
Signed, at last, in 1991 to SBK Records, Secada benefited directly from the 
lessons Estefan had absorbed marketing Miami Sound Machine and then Gloria to 
the Latin and mainstream pop markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I got signed as an Anglo artist, Emilio, from the beginning, said 
to the record company, 'We gotta do this stuff bilingual, there's a big market, 
a lot of potential,' " Secada says. "We didn't intend to record in Spanish 
necessarily -- it was 'Let's pick two songs, see how they do.' So they let me 
do two Spanish songs, versions of 'Just Another Day' and 'Angel' on the English 
album." 
</P>
<P>
 The response to the experiment among Latin radio stations and record buyers 
was overwhelmingly positive, prompting the recording of the "Otro Dia Mas" 
Spanish-language version of "Jon Secada." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Estefan: "His market was really the Anglo market, so the crossover for 
him was really the reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 A fistful of Latin No. 1s and a Grammy later, Secada still marvels at the 
acceptance: "My career in Spanish was overnight superstardom in every sense of 
the word. I didn't know I would get that kind of response from the Latin 
market. I'm very happy I did 'the Spanish songs,' because from Day One, we've 
had both markets." 
</P>
<P>
 And he means to keep them. "Si Te Vas," the Spanish version of the new "Heart, 
Soul & a Voice" album, will be released July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, Secada's first world tour opens Oct. 6, not in the United States 
but in Mexico City, and is scheduled to hit most of Latin America and the 
Caribbean before coming to the States early next year. While Secada will play 
3,000-5,000-seat venues in the United States, his stature in Latin America 
allows him to perform in 20,000-seat stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except Brazil, not much talent goes to these countries," Secada says. "But I 
want to go there because the album did really well, (and to) make a statement 
of performing in these countries that are part of the Latin American world." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Secada consolidates his Pan-Latin audience, it's worth noting that, 
Spanish lyrics and his own ethnic heritage aside, his music has few obvious 
Latin influences. Secada, instead, flies world music's multicultural flag -- he 
browses through a variety of musical lexicons then binds them to sure-fire 
grooves. The approach, says agent Pinos, is well-suited to the programming 
style of Latin radio stations.  
</P>
<P>
 "Spanish radio plays all kinds of music," Pinos says. "A little pop, a little 
rock, a little salsa." The song "Whipped," which opens "Heart, Soul & a Voice," 
summarizes Secada's ability to synthesize influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading off with a trenchant R&B industrial drum track and ominous vocal 
samples, the song mixes soothing Latin inflections on the verses with explosive 
gospel-singer choruses. Secada even tosses in a lusty, soul-man "right on" on 
the fade-out. "I'm very proud of that song," he says. "That's the direction I 
want to get into." 
</P>
<P>
 Given his conservatory training and Estefan's tutelage, there are facets of 
Secada's talent he has probably only begun to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, ever alert to the possibilities of a presentable and 
non-controversial star, has already weighed in with film offers, which Estefan 
thought it wise to turn down. But with Secada's pinup looks, multiracial makeup 
and bilingualism, he is perfectly positioned to exploit the needs of a music 
industry now controlled by conglomerates that depend heavily on overseas sales 
for profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Secada's Pan-culturalism is perfectly suited to a world in which racial and 
national boundaries increasingly blur -- Americans can claim him as one of 
their own, but so can Cubans, Portuguese, Costa Ricans, Spaniards and Mexicans. 
Seen in this context, Secada's sudden stardom seems much less unlikely. It also 
makes an ethnic pop star like Michael Jackson -- who, however strong his appeal 
abroad, will forever be viewed as a U.S. export -- look suddenly out of date. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This afternoon, the business of being Jon Secada is being conducted in the 
wings of the "Friday Night" set. Ringed by klieg lights, publicists and senior 
factotums such as Pinos, Secada perches on a stool and waits patiently to be 
fed rehearsed questions for the show's interview segment. 
</P>
<P>
 The just-wrapped "Tonight Show" taping couldn't have gone much better. Jay 
Leno introduced Secada as "my good friend," and guest Eddie Murphy took time 
out from flogging "Beverly Hills Cop III" to announce he is a big fan and then 
lingered on the couch to watch the singer nail "If You Go." Now Secada, who has 
conducted more than 100 interviews in support of this new album, girds himself 
for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tape is rolling -- waiting for speed," a stage manager barks. "In three, two 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we want to say is congratulations on your success," an 
interviewer off-camera reads from a clipboard. "Your life has changed 
dramatically. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "My life has changed in different ways," Secada murmurs earnestly. "Mainly the 
pace has changed, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold it," says the stage manager, listening to the control booth through his 
headset. "They're not happy with the spot on his left cheek." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinos steps into the lights and examines Secada's face like a plastic surgeon 
prepping a patient. "It looks like a hole," the agent declares. "We don't want 
to see that spot." 
</P>
<P>
 The lights are repositioned and the interview begins again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read a quote recently," says the interviewer, "where you said your life had 
changed dramatically since the debut album. Will you tell us about some of 
those changes?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my life has definitely changed dramatically," Secada says, somehow 
managing to deliver the humble platitudes of a grateful young star without 
sounding like Eddie Haskell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As he speaks, it's hard not to reflect on the events that, somehow, brought 
him to this juncture of his life: 
</P>
<P>
 The bewildering plane flight from Havana to Miami when he was 8 and the 
astonishment at seeing supermarket shelves bulging with food. 
</P>
<P>
 His father's imprisonment in a Castro work camp after a failed first attempt 
to flee to the States. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffee shops that his parents, since retired, ran to support the family in 
Hialeah. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweetness of discovering his voice as a shy teen-ager singing along with 
Philip Bailey, Barry White, the O'Jays, the Spinners. 
</P>
<P>
 And the memory of the administrator at Miami-Dade Community College, who 
assured him that if the singing career didn't work out, he could always come 
back to his teaching gig. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Secada will board a red-eye back to Miami, back to suppers of 
black beans and rice and sweet plantains, back to his new Art-Deco house on the 
ocean that he won't really have time to live in until he comes off the road at 
the end of next year. By then, having taken the business of being Jon Secada 
around the world and vindicating Emilio Estefan's crossover instincts, he plans 
to buy a boat. What kind? 
</P>
<P>
 Secada smiles his handsome smile. "Something fast," he says.

ART; OLD HOLLYWOOD'S NEW ARTISTIC JOLT; LACE AND RE:SOLUTION HAVE MOVED FROM 
THE CENTRAL CITY INTO HOLLYWOOD. THE GOAL FOR BOTH ARTS INSTITUTIONS IS A NEW 
ENERGY. BROADER AUDIENCES WOULD BE NICE TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Forget Frederick's of Hollywood's racy underwear, his 'n' hers spike heels in 
every color of the psychedelic rainbow, leather jackets splashed with images of 
Marilyn and Elvis. When you consider the attractions of Hollywood Boulevard, 
think contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequined string bikinis and other bizarre enticements still twinkle in shop 
windows along the legendary thoroughfare, just as transvestites and tourists 
continue to parade on sidewalks embedded with stars named for celebrities. But 
the opening of two nonprofit art institutions -- with public receptions 
Thursday from 7 to 10 p.m. -- has given one block of Hollywood Boulevard an 
infusion of painting, sculpture, photography, video, performance and computer 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, a 15-year-old multidisciplinary forum 
for cutting-edge art, has moved into the former Newberry School of Beauty, at 
6522 Hollywood Blvd., two blocks west of Cahuenga Boulevard. Two doors east, at 
6518 Hollywood Blvd., is RE:SOLUTION, a reincarnation of the 20-year-old Los 
Angeles Center for Photographic Studies, which supports photographic arts, 
video and digital imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Both organizations have forsaken the mean streets of central Los Angeles for 
Hollywood. LACE initially resided above the Victor Clothing Co. on Broadway, 
then moved to Industrial Street, in a warehouse district that has become 
increasingly crime-infested. In its former life, RE:SOLUTION operated a gallery 
at Spring and 8th streets until the neighborhood became too dangerous, then 
relocated at 6th Street and Beaudry Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Tawdry as their new neighborhood may appear, the two institutions consider it 
a step up, and their leaders speak longingly of joining Hollywood's arts 
community and building a broader audience in an area that has such assets as 
pedestrian traffic and convenient parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite fantasy is that everyone will see every show, every video, every 
performance we offer," said Gwen Darien, LACE's executive director. "We have 
the possibility of a public space with an incredibly diverse audience, and we 
want it to be a center of vitality that reflects what goes on in the 
contemporary art world -- not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the world." 
</P>
<P>
 RE:SOLUTION's expanded gallery space will provide an opportunity to display a 
much wider range of art, and heightened visibility will ensure that more people 
see it, said Joe Smoke, director of the photography center. An important factor 
in his organization's new image is a merger with EZ Arts, the nonprofit video 
and digital branch of EZTV. This partnership will allow RE:SOLUTION to become 
"a true gallery of the 21st Century, featuring video screening in the evenings 
and looking ahead to new technology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These aspirations have been hard won, however, and the future of Hollywood's 
new art block is uncertain. After a two-year process that was complicated by a 
change of city administration, following the election of Mayor Richard Riordan, 
LACE and RE:SOLUTION have secured five-year leases with renewal options through 
the Community Redevelopment Agency, in a block owned by the city's Department 
of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-range plans call for building a larger complex and parking structure on 
the site -- perhaps a sort of farmers' market -- but no plan has been adopted 
and financing is not available. Arts institutions could be incorporated in the 
new development, but they would not be its focus, said Lester Burg, assistant 
project manager for the CRA's Hollywood Redevelopment Project, a $1-billion 
plan bordered by La Brea, Fountain, Western and Franklin avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the CRA expects the new arrivals to enhance a redevelopment 
district that already claims about 30 live theaters and has several other arts 
projects in the works. Just west of the art block on Hollywood Boulevard, 
American Cinematheque, a nonprofit center for the appreciation of film and 
video, is remodeling the historic Egyptian Theatre. To the east, the Pacific 
Theater building is being transformed into the Hollywood Entertainment Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Moguls, a cafe-theater-gallery, is already entrenched on the art 
block. And TRI, an adventurous gallery operated by artist Rory Devine, is 
moving to 6365 Yucca St. and opening on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this neighborhood," Darien said, leading a visitor on a tour of LACE's 
new surroundings. "It's urban and gritty. It has some of the qualities that 
were a positive attraction for the downtown space, but it's safer and we have 
accessible, attended, cheap parking." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Kirby, chairman of LACE's board, believes that the move was essential. 
"To stay put -- in the particular part of downtown Los Angeles where LACE was 
located -- would be to die. We are running away from that, but Hollywood 
Boulevard is not exactly the suburbs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one would confuse the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard with a commercial 
district in Palos Verdes Estates or Westlake Village. But for all its rough 
edges and kinky sideshows, the change of address reflects a serious attempt to 
get a grip on LACE's future. Buffeted by a shifting art scene, squeezed by a 
sour economy and embattled by city politics, LACE finally has a chance to 
re-establish itself as a vigorous community arts center, slimmed down and toned 
up for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 LACE was founded in 1978 by a group of 13 artists, most of whom had joined 
forces in East Los Angeles in a program funded by the federal Comprehensive 
Employment Training Act. The organization developed into a lively -- if 
contentious -- exhibition and performance center under the direction of artist 
Marc Pally, from 1979 to 1983, and Joy Silverman, from 1983 to 1990. But 
Silverman's resignation and Roberto Bedoya's subsequent seven-month term of 
leadership coincided with a downturn in the economy and the central city. 
</P>
<P>
 When Darien became director in 1991 -- after 8 1/2 years as deputy director of 
New York's PS1, a well-known contemporary art center -- she took over an 
organization that was troubled by financial woes, falling attendance and 
dissension over the representation of minority artists. Known as an energetic 
and adroit consensus builder, she has presided over a tumultuous period when 
LACE seemed to fade from the scene as its move was delayed. The final 
exhibition, featuring Jean Lowe's work, closed last June. In recent months, 
LACE's video program has been presented at the Ruth Bloom Gallery in Santa 
Monica, while Hollywood Moguls has served as a forum for LACE performances. 
</P>
<P>
 A mission statement defines LACE as "a nonprofit interdisciplinary 
contemporary arts organization that presents art and ideas and serves as a 
forum for an evolving dialogue between both emerging and established artists 
and their audiences." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our challenge in Hollywood is to develop and make clear to the public the 
multidisciplinary nature of the institution," Darien said. "The move allows us 
to fulfill our mission more completely and in a more public way, and to reach 
out beyond people who went downtown because they were interested. We want to 
attract new people as well as sustain our consistent audience." 
</P>
<P>
 A recently completed five-year strategic plan calls for promoting the 
multidisciplinary aspect of the institution, strengthening the program's 
critical context by publishing a brochure or catalogue on each exhibition and 
developing educational programs and public outreach, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is all part of adapting LACE, a so-called alternative space, to the 
present realities of the art scene. Organizations such as LACE were hatched in 
the 1970s as artist-run alternatives to museums and commercial galleries, 
giving artists a place to show experimental work without strictures of 
tradition or the market. But the concept became confused during the boom of the 
1980s, when artists fresh out of school were snapped up by galleries. Then the 
art market crashed, wiping out a large number of galleries and sharply 
curtailing collecting. During the past few years, artists and youthful 
entrepreneurs have taken matters into their own hands by opening shoestring 
commercial operations that show works similar to what might be seen at LACE. 
</P>
<P>
 "The field is wide open now," Kirby said. "The whole art world is trying to 
find out how to operate after the bubble burst. 
</P>
<P>
 "LACE has a history and the momentum of that history, but it's still on the 
fringe. We just want to show good work, as we have always done. LACE is not the 
only place where this work can be shown now, but there are never enough 
spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 LACE's emphasis on video and performance is particularly critical because 
forums for them have always been in short supply in Southern California, Kirby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul McCarthy, a prominent sculptor and performance artist who got a leg up at 
LACE, agrees. "If work doesn't get shown, inevitably it doesn't get made," he 
said, adding that Los Angeles has a dearth of showcases for experimental art. 
</P>
<P>
 Darien calls LACE a contemporary arts center rather than an alternative space. 
</P>
<P>
 " Alternative has a specific meaning -- reacting against something, and 
reacting is a limiting concept," she said. "One of the things we do is to 
provide alternatives to museums, which collect art, and to galleries, which 
sell art. We provide a forum for experimentation, but experimentation doesn't 
mean simply reacting. It's building something as well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LACE's program will be lodged in a building that has undergone little exterior 
change. The stucco and blue tile facade will remain the same, with the 
exception of a splashy LACE sign replacing the old Newberry School of Beauty 
label. Inside, the front room is a 640-square-foot gallery, named for LACE 
patrons Fred and Janet Kessler. The space will be used for exhibitions until 
funds are available to turn it into a cafe-bookstore with window displays of 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want LACE to be an open, accessible place where people meet," said 
architect Frederick Fisher, who designed the renovation, including plans for 
the cafe-bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The main exhibition space -- called the Peter Norton Family Gallery, in honor 
of the Los Angeles-based computer guru and arts philanthropist -- is a 
1,500-square-foot hall with a coved ceiling. To the rear of the building are a 
1,400-square-foot performance space and a 300-square-foot video room for 
single-channel programs and installations. 
</P>
<P>
 The major challenges in overhauling the building were to accommodate LACE's 
programs in a space that is a bit smaller than its former home and to work 
within an extremely low budget, Fisher said. The CRA provided $75,000 for the 
renovation. (General funding for LACE comes from the Arts Organization 
Stabilization Initiative, the California Arts Council, the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Andy Warhol Foundation for 
the Visual Arts and other sources.) 
</P>
<P>
 LACE will launch its new building with "Nor Here Neither There," an exhibition 
of paintings by Suzanne Garrison and Spandau Parks, sculpture by Willie Cole, 
Chris Finley and Nari Ward, photographs by Sharon Lockhart and Lorraine 
O'Grady, video by Doug Aitken, Tom Burr and Stan Douglas, film by Valie Export, 
a spoken-word performance by Cynthia Stewart and a musical performance by 
Mythter. Representing many points of view, the artists hail from various 
California cities, as well as New York, Vancouver and Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 While not construed as a model for future LACE exhibitions, the show's 
curatorial process and its varied contents offer insight into the 
organization's philosophy. Darien appointed not one but four curators -- 
artists McCarthy, Charles Gaines and Stephen Prina, and Fran Seegull, curator 
of the Norton collection and foundation. Working without guidelines, the 
curators proceeded to assemble an exhibition that has no theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "All four of us were interested in exploring alternative methods of curating," 
Seegull said. "We didn't want a theme; we were looking for a more organic 
model." As a result, they each picked artists whose work interested them and 
brought their ideas to a series of meetings. "There was some overlap, but no 
political jockeying," she said. "We continued to meet until the show almost 
curated itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The title, "Nor Here Neither There," refers to LACE's geographical limbo of 
the past year and to a broader perceptual disjuncture between the present and 
the future, she said.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 RE:SOLUTION was founded in 1974, as the Los Angeles Center for Photographic 
Studies, by seven photographers who wanted to expand the boundaries of the 
medium. The center, originally located in a small Westside tract house, in 1981 
opened its first permanent showcase, at 814 N. Spring St. The center developed 
an active program of exhibitions, lectures and workshops, but the 
neighborhood's decline led the organization to move in 1987. After three years 
in a temporary space, it opened a small storefront gallery at 1048 W. 6th St., 
staging exhibitions there and at other local arts institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, renamed RE:SOLUTION, received $40,000 from the CRA to 
renovate its new 3,500-square-foot home, in a storefront formerly occupied by 
New World Jewelry. Architect Josh Schweitzer designed the space to include a 
1,200-square-foot central gallery, a smaller installation space in the back and 
a front window gallery and niche to sell the organization's publication, 
FRAME-WORK: The Journal of Images and Culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The inaugural event in the main gallery is the annual members' show, curated 
by Denise Miller-Clark, director of Chicago's Museum of Contemporary 
Photography. "El Palacio del Amor," an installation by Bob de Bris, will 
christen the back gallery, while Marlo Marrero's project "Don't I Know You?" 
will be in the window gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Street-level window displays, such as Marrero's, are expected to entice a new 
audience into both LACE and RE:SOLUTION -- and to present the institutions with 
new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to museums, it's a ritualized experience," LACE's Kirby said. "On 
Hollywood Boulevard, you expect something completely different. This will be 
more like shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 People who wander into the exhibitions won't like everything they see, he 
said. "But when you go shopping, you aren't disappointed if you don't like 90% 
of what you see. And if you don't like everything, you don't stop going."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; SEABORG HOUSE IS SITE OF LANDMARK DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking at a row of bungalows on San Antonio Avenue, it is difficult to 
imagine that one of them is a historic monument. But the tiny white home with 
green trim at 9237 San Antonio Ave. is where Nobel laureate Glenn T. Seaborg, 
who discovered plutonium in 1940 at age 28, spent much of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the little house is growing into a big controversy over whether the city 
should save the 700-square-foot structure as a landmark. The historical 
significance of the home, currently occupied by a caretaker, has run up against 
South Gate's increasing need for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just like to see the house I was raised in kept," said Seaborg, now 
82 and a resident of the Northern California town of Lafayette. "Who likes to 
see their house . . . demolished? I suppose there is a little bit of ego in 
(fighting to save) it."  
</P>
<P>
 The city last week commissioned an analysis to figure out how much it would 
cost to move and refurbish the house. The outcome of that, city officials say, 
may help decide whether the house will be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to go the least expensive route," said Mayor Albert Robles, who 
supports preserving the house. "I don't want to put the city in the position of 
demolishing the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Seaborg is probably the most famous native of South Gate. He won the Nobel 
Prize for Chemistry in 1951 and served on the Atomic Energy Commission, the 
forerunner of the Department of Energy. He was also chancellor of UC Berkeley, 
where he still works as a professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaborg, who moved out of South Gate around 1930, sold the spacious lot to the 
city in 1991 for $175,000 and donated the house with the agreement that it 
would be preserved. But today the house, in need of a paint job, is looking 
less and less like a museum.  
</P>
<P>
 The man who has taken up the fight to save the Seaborg house is Sam Echols, a 
70-year-old who also volunteers as president of the city's one-room museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great man," Echols said of Seaborg. "He has met (Nikita) 
Khrushchev. He has met kings and premiers and, you know, he is from our little 
town here." 
</P>
<P>
 Echols has collected boxes of Seaborg's letters, research, and copies of Time 
and Business Week from 1961 and 1964 that have Seaborg's picture on the cover. 
There are more boxes of Seaborg memorabilia in the City Hall basement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite a sight to see," Echols said. "I have a soft spot for stuff like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, after a passionate debate, the City Council voted 3 to 2 to 
move the house to make way for affordable housing. The city staff began drawing 
up plans for the project, which in addition to moving the house to a parking 
lot near City Hall would also include sprucing it up and retrofitting it to 
meet earthquake safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can move it to another location, but, like most cities, there is no money 
to do that," said Ruben Lopez, deputy director for redevelopment. "In terms of 
architecture, (the house) is not a historical landmark aside from the fact that 
it is where Dr. Seaborg grew up."  
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said that, because the funds are not on hand, the city may have to 
scrape for private funding from historic preservation foundations dedicated to 
saving such landmarks. BOB ELSTON

THEATER; SLIPPING TONY A MICKEY?; AMERICAN THEATER CAN'T DISMISS DISNEY 
DOLLARS, BUT IT CAN DERIDE THE PRODUCT. SO HOW WILL 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' FARE 
AT THE TONY AWARDS? 'PASSION' STANDS IN THE WAY. HOW MUCH MORE DRAMA DO YOU 
NEED?

 "What this year's Tony Awards ceremony needs," says Broadway producer Richard 
Jay-Alexander, "is the theater's equivalent of Tonya Harding and Nancy 
Kerrigan. A real fight-out fraught with tension that'll get people to tune in." 
</P>
<P>
 There's only one category that might qualify among the 20 that will yield 
winners tonight on the 48th annual CBS telecast, and that is the race for one 
of the two top Tonys -- best musical. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional Broadway Establishment, represented by the Shubert 
Organization and the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical "Passion," is facing 
off against the new 800-pound kid on the block -- "Beauty and the Beast," 
produced by Disney, whose well-financed and maverick ways have sent tremors 
through the small, cliquish industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion" leads with 10 nominations, but "Beauty," the most expensive musical 
ever mounted on Broadway, has nine. 
</P>
<P>
 What's at stake is not only prestige and a marketing boost. The winner will 
also signal where the Establishment power stands in an industry increasingly 
anxious about its commercial future (despite the fact that ticket sales are 
up). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Tony Awards are also about art and quality on Broadway, and 
that certainly will play a role in selecting the winners. But, according to 
most insiders, the politics are more pronounced than usual this year, partly 
because neither musical has managed to muster much enthusiasm among the 678 
Tony voters -- producers, the media and representatives of theatrical unions 
and organizations. It's also because the Broadway theater itself appears to be 
in more of a state of flux than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going through a rather convulsive period of time, especially in the 
musical theater," says James Freydberg, a New York producer ("Fool Moon") who 
recently took a lease on the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles. The paucity on 
Broadway of strong, influential activist voices like the late Joseph Papp's has 
taken its toll. "Nobody knows what to do," Freydberg added, "so they're doing 
revivals. That's not producing, that's presenting. Things seem to be in an odd 
holding pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the best musical revival category has four strong contenders -- 
"Carousel," "She Loves Me," "Grease" and "Damn Yankees." But the Tony 
nominating committee practically had to be whipped and hogtied to come up with 
four best musical nominees. A minor scandal erupted on the day the nominations 
were announced because the committee balked at adding the two other shows that 
were eventually nominated -- "Cyrano," a Dutch import based on the Edmond 
Rostand classic, and "A Grand Night for Singing," a Rodgers and Hammerstein 
musical revue -- both of which have closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have understood if they'd eliminated that category altogether," said 
producer Margo Lion ("Jelly's Last Jam"). " 'Beauty and the Beast' really is a 
world apart. It doesn't have anything to do with what the rest of us are doing. 
And 'Passion'? It's new and daring, but its appeal is not very broad. So what 
you have is one show of limited artistic quality and wide commercial appeal 
pitted against a show of ambitious artistry and limited accessibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like both musicals," said Robert Straus, a Broadway general manager. "The 
problem is that there are only two productions to show for a whole season. I'd 
like more choice." 
</P>
<P>
 By coincidence, "Beauty and the Beast" and "Passion" share themes. Both 
inspired by movies, the musicals, to some extent, are about physical and 
spiritual beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Disney's enormously popular animated feature, "Beauty and the Beast" 
is an extravagant $12-million retelling of the 18th-Century French fairy tale 
about an ugly beast in an enchanted castle who tries to win the heart of a 
bookish young girl. 
</P>
<P>
 When the show opened last March at the Palace, many reviewers likened it to a 
Disney theme-park event and spent about as much space on the all-stops-out 
merchandising in the lobby as on the all-stops-out production. Damp notices, 
however, had little effect at the box office and the show is this season's 
hottest ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passion" is the musical adaptation of a 19th-Century Italian novel of dark 
and obsessive love. The fatal attraction here is between a plain, consumptive 
woman and a handsome soldier. Unlike the cuddly pair at the heart of the Disney 
spectacular, Fosca and Giorgio are an intense but doom-ridden duo, playing out 
their disturbing and dissonant affair in a severe and cerebral $4.5-million 
production at the Plymouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a troubled preview period in New York, the show opened to mixed but 
respectful notices. Buoyed by the magical name of Stephen Sondheim, the 
adventurous show has been drawing moderately well, but most people agree that 
it must win the Tony to have a viable run, because of its difficult subject 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If "Passion" prevails, there is speculation that "Disney-bashing," as it has 
been characterized in the press, will have had something to do with it. Much 
has been written about the less-than-warm welcome extended by the theater 
Establishment to the rich and powerful entertainment conglomerate since its 
arrival on Broadway. Eyebrows were immediately raised when Disney chose a 
director, choreographer and set designer whose experience stemmed largely from 
creating theme-park productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving notice that they intended to do things their own way, including putting 
up all the money themselves, Disney's executives aroused the envy and 
skepticism of many of Broadway's elite, who have to scramble, sometimes for 
years, to raise financing for a show. In an industry with so few major players, 
there was concern that a company with such deep pockets might shift the 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been entirely surprised by the so-called 'bashing,' " said Robert 
McTyre, who produced "Beauty and the Beast" for Disney. "But we're getting 
standing ovations every night and selling out, so we did something right. We 
have a particular point of view and appeal and we believe there's room for that 
on Broadway and for 'Passion' as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broadway community's mixed feelings have been compounded by the Disney 
Co.'s commitment to renovate 42nd Street's New Amsterdam Theatre, thus 
spearheading the long-delayed redevelopment of the tawdry Times Square area. 
When news of Disney's deal with the city, which included tax abatements and a 
low-interest $21-million loan, first surfaced, longstanding Broadway theater 
owners protested they were entitled to some of the same favorable tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still many producers have expressed the hope that Disney's muscle will help to 
bring down steep union costs that are making musicals prohibitively expensive 
to mount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted that Disney's on Broadway," said producer John Hart of Kardana 
Productions, which co-produced "Guys and Dolls" and "Tommy." "I think 'Beauty 
and the Beast' misses on the emotions, but its sense of spectacle will bring a 
lot of new and younger people into the theater. Quite frankly, I worry about 
them turning Times Square into a theme park. I don't want to come to work in a 
monorail and get my morning cup of coffee from Minnie Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
 A more commonly stated fear is that a company as rich as Disney will 
repeatedly come up with the money to create a product that will do little to 
advance -- and may even be detrimental -- to the art form of theater itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even the Broadway pros have not exactly been successful with 
musicals this season. Harold Prince and Tommy Tune -- the two directors most 
successful in combining artistry with commerce in the proportions that Tony 
voters love -- are notably absent from among the nominees. Tune had a 
disastrous flop with "The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public" last month and 
Prince's new show is a revival of "Showboat," a 67-year-old musical that opened 
in Toronto and won't be in New York until the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Davidson, artistic director of Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum, which is 
nominated as co-producer of three of the four best play nominees ("Twilight," 
"Perestroika," "Kentucky Cycle"), suggests that too much emphasis is being 
placed on "Beauty and the Beast" as the litmus test of future Disney 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money can't buy quality," he says. "But it can't hurt. The next venture for 
Disney will tell us more than 'Beauty,' and it may not be quite so easy to 
adapt in the same way. They're very smart people. I think they've learned a lot 
and may reach out to more traditional artists next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's McTyre agrees that may be the case but thinks the repeated 
comparisons to theme-park entertainment are "ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do things that are Disney-branded, but we're going to look for 
original things as well."  
</P>
<P>
 Where "Beauty and the Beast" to a certain extent came to Broadway as a 
pre-sold hit, "Passion" took a more perilous route. Unlike most original 
American musicals, which these days go through years of development and 
workshop productions, the latest Sondheim-Lapine collaboration was in previews 
within six months of its only workshop production at Lincoln Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would send a terrific signal if 'Passion' won," the Taper's 
Davidson said. "It's great whenever works that are of a certain boldness and 
ambition can be acknowledged. It encourages risk-taking from other quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a writer in the theater, I see a growing tendency toward frivolousness," 
said writer-director Richard Maltby ("Miss Saigon"). "Steve's on the artistic 
cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for all the reverence and respect accorded to Sondheim by the Broadway 
community, there is still a nagging sense among some that a vote for the 
esoteric "Passion" over "Beauty" sends a misleading signal to the general 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the lyrics of 'Company' better than the national anthem," says John 
Hart, "but I'm not comfortable voting for 'Passion.' Broadway is in danger of 
becoming like opera -- too expensive, too elite and no longer part of people's 
vocabularies. When I attended 'Passion,' I was stunned by its failures to 
connect with an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 A Broadway press agent who wished to remain anonymous put it even more 
bluntly. " 'Passion' needs the win to stay alive," he says, "but it won't 
promote Broadway business in the long run. If the average tourist goes to see 
it because it won the Tony over, say, seeing 'Crazy for You,' then it's likely 
to scare them off. The effect of it winning will be fascinating, if ironic. 
After all, the Tony is supposed to not only promote excellence, but also 
promote Broadway business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is neither Sondheim nor Disney's responsibility, of course, to create 
products that will please the Tony voters. In the end, awards often have little 
to do with real merit. The recent past is littered with examples of musicals 
that won the best musical Tony and never recouped their investment while on 
Broadway ("Will Rogers Follies" is one). Furthermore, Sondheim's "Sunday in the 
Park With George," which lost to "La Cage aux Folles" in 1984, appears to be 
growing in stature as "La Cage" recedes into memory. 
</P>
<P>
 While many voters express the wish that they could vote on nominees that more 
confidently combined artistic excellence with commercial appeal, the problems 
with the Broadway musical will persist long after the envelopes are discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sadness in the American theater at this moment is that even many of our 
hits are not new work," Maltby said. "Even 'Tommy' is 25 years old. Leave Steve 
(Sondheim) out and there are not many new and talented creators around, and I'm 
not sure that Disney's arrival on the scene is going to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what the irony is in all this," said one voter. "Steve's Oscar is 
for 'Sooner or Later,' a song from 'Dick Tracy' that Disney produced, and James 
Lapine's last movie, 'Life With Mikey,' was also released by one of their 
companies. We may all end up working for Disney, sooner or later."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; CENTER OFFERS LOWER RATE TO CASH 
CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tina Romero recently walked into a small check cashing place in Huntington 
Park with two checks worth $500.  
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later she walked out with about $482 in cash -- $18 had been 
taken off the top by the check cashers for processing and service fees -- a 
surcharge of more than 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," said Romero, a Bell resident who works nearby at a Huntington 
Park office that handles worker's compensation claims. "It was too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero fits the profile of the customer that the newly opened Cash and Save, a 
check cashing service operated by Union Bank, is trying to lure. Had she taken 
her $500 to Cash and Save, she would have been charged about $6.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Bank opened the center on Zoe Avenue in Huntington Park after finding 
that many people in Southeast Los Angeles do not maintain checking and savings 
accounts in traditional banks. Instead, they cash their payroll checks and then 
get a series of money orders to pay bills.  
</P>
<P>
 Romero, for example, does not use the nearby Bank of America because it 
requires customers to have an account in order to cash checks. She and many 
people in the community rely on check cashers, some of which charge steep fees, 
for their banking needs.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cash and Save charges a check-cashing rate of 1.25% to 1.5% and offers 
low-cost -- even free -- money orders. Other check-cashing businesses charge up 
to 3% to 4% for converting payroll and government checks to cash.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Union Bank officials hope customers will be drawn by offers of 
free money orders. For customers with a $7.50 membership at Cash and Save, the 
bank will provide six free money orders per month for one year to pay utility 
bills, said Joanne Curren, bank spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Park center also seeks to win the loyalty of people who are 
generally not very trusting of banks by offering such services as consumer and 
small-business loans, checking and savings accounts, phone cards, secured 
credit cards and wire transfers to foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will help people establish credit histories," Curren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, with advice from a friend, visited the Cash and Save last week. This 
time, she spent about 10 minutes inside before emerging with a personal 
identification card to be used for cashing checks at a rate considerably lower 
than she had been paying. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it catches on there, then you might see one coming to our city," said Jack 
Joseph, Cudahy city manager. Joseph said that Cudahy's population of 24,000 is 
served by one bank and a smattering of check cashing places. "We want people to 
get over their fear of banks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Park Cash and Save, 2675 Zoe Ave., is open Monday through 
Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. BOB ELSTON

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: CUDAHY; CITY TO HELP FUND SATELLITE CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously last week to help fund a satellite campus 
of the Los Angeles Community College in Huntington Park to provide adult 
education opportunities for residents in Southeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 By contributing $6,000 to the effort, Cudahy joins six other cities that have 
agreed to support the campus, situated in a Pacific Bell building at 2675 Zoe 
Ave., in Huntington Park."The idea was to provide a satellite campus more 
accessible for people who live in this area," said Jack Joseph, Cudahy city 
manager. The East Los Angeles Community College main campus is eight or nine 
miles away.  
</P>
<P>
 Joseph said college officials intend to hold some general education as well as 
adult education classes there. 
</P>
<P>
 The community college, in fact, has operated spring-semester classes out of 
the building. But because the building is being leased and the college did not 
provide funds in its budget for that, the nearby cities of Bell, Bell Gardens, 
Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood, South Gate and Vernon have pooled money to 
pay the lease for the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite campus also has to be remodeled and retrofitted with an elevator 
to meet fire safety standards. Those improvements should be completed by fall.

 Michael Estrada, who has served as interim city attorney, has been hired to 
the post by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's first task was to design a fee schedule that will save the city 
thousands of dollars annually in legal expenses.He has delivered his proposal 
to the city manager but would not discuss his fees until after the City Council 
sees them on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Barbosa was fired as city attorney last summer, in part because his 
rates were too high. The city often paid $20,000 a month for his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada, 38, works in the Downtown law firm of Richards, Watson & Gershon and 
plans to open an office in Bell Gardens City Hall. He said he will spend 20 to 
25 hours per week there. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada also serves as assistant city attorney in Norwalk, South El Monte and 
La Puente. BOB ELSTON

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; TALK SHOW INVITES YOUTHS TO 'GET REAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of them come from families that follow traditional Asian customs of 
behavior -- reserved, obedient and soft-spoken in public. 
</P>
<P>
 But Asian teens born or raised in America are trying to break out of that mold 
and find their own voice. Some are doing it through a year-old TV talk show, 
"Get Real." 
</P>
<P>
 The KSCI-TV Channel 18 series, which started airing monthly in April, 1993, 
gives high school- and college-age youths a forum to speak out on issues 
ranging from racial conflicts to media images of Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 One regular panelist said she wanted to appear on "Get Real" to increase the 
visibility of Asians in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really important for us to see us in the media," said Hae Jin 
Lee, 18, of Westlake. "That shows that we're involved in the community. We're 
not silent." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the need for Asians to be heard motivated "Get Real" co-producer 
Martie Quan to pitch the idea of an Oprah Winfrey-like, English-speaking talk 
show to KSCI-TV management. The station is known more for its multilingual 
programs that have attracted viewers from such Asian communities as Chinatown, 
Little Tokyo and Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of each show, Amy Hill, an actress of Japanese-Finnish 
descent, steps into the schoolyard set where teen panelists sit on bleachers. 
She introduces the topic and acts as a moderator throughout the program. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent taping at a KSCI-TV studio near West Los Angeles, about 15 
panelists discussed three topics: racial tension between African Americans and 
Asian Americans, media images and gender issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the first one that ignited the most comments, especially in 
response to what one African American college student said about Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Lee Sandor of Torrance, a guest on the show, told the group that she 
often has trouble communicating with Asians because they're not used to her 
assertive nature. She also challenged them to move away from the stereotype 
that all blacks come from South-Central or the "ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Asian panelists responded by saying that they feel intimidated by 
aggressive or assertive behavior and are fearful of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be polite. I want to hear you out," said Hae Jin Lee, a Korean-born 
American who uses the name "Jean" on the show. "I feel like you don't want to 
give me the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Conrad Asuncion, 18, a Filipino American from Culver City, "If I'm 
walking down the hall and 10 black people are coming toward me, I'd be really 
scared 'cause even though I am dark-skinned, I have slanted eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Blacks) make fun of me because I have slanted eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, no solutions were offered. But Hill did close the segment by 
encouraging panelists and viewers to build "some bridges between our races. 
What we need to do is have more serious discussions among ourselves . . . to 
clear up some misconceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Although producers have no way of tracking the show's viewership, some Asian 
health and community groups around Downtown have found previous episodes useful 
as educational materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very good tool for reaching out to our young people," said Leo Pandac, 
a counselor at Pacific Asian Alcohol Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Pandac agreed to appear with other teens on a "Get Real" program taped in 
March about alcohol abuse. He has since replayed that episode to about 40 
youths and adults, and plans to show it to second-generation Cambodian 
teen-agers in Echo Park and Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Another program on Asian teen pregnancy solicited expert opinion from Lisa 
Hasegawa, coordinator of a state-funded, Chinatown-based program called 
Education Now and Babies Later. Hasegawa has since shown that segment to 100 
junior high-age Asian teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They were) surprised that there is a show with all Asian teens," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program airs on the second Tuesday of each month at 4:30 p.m. More than 
100 youths have appeared on the program. TOMMY LI

THE TANGLE OVER 'TWILIGHT'; ANNA DEAVERE SMITH, JOURNALIST? ANNA DEAVERE SMITH, 
PLAYWRIGHT? HER 'TWILIGHT: LOS ANGELES, 1992' HAS BEEN BOTH HAILED AS A 
SENSATION AND BESET BY DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE PIECE IS A PLAY OR JUST 
REPORTAGE. WHO'S RIGHT, TONY OR PULITZER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman play about the riots, "Twilight: Los Angeles, 
1992," now struggling to survive on Broadway after six weeks despite rapturous 
reviews and standing ovations, could gain additional longevity and respect if 
it wins either of the two major Tony Awards for which it is nominated tonight 
in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Since its prominent premiere last year at the Mark Taper Forum, which 
commissioned it, "Twilight" has been both hailed as a sensational theatrical 
event and bedeviled by disagreement in the theater community and press as to 
how it should be measured -- whether it is truly a work of the imagination and 
therefore pure dramatic art, or whether it is a form of journalism as 
performance art and therefore something less. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument was highlighted a few weeks ago when this year's Pulitzer Prize 
jury in drama disallowed "Twilight" for final consideration on the grounds that 
its language was not invented but gleaned from interviews. That it was even 
being discussed by the Pulitzer jury was an indication of how high the play had 
soared in the minds of some critics, while the decision to disqualify it for 
technical reasons might have been puzzling to anyone aware that the previous 
year's Pulitzer jury had judged Smith's earlier show "Fires in the Mirror" 
(similarly developed and performed, about ethnic battles in Brooklyn) a 
legitimate runner-up for the 1992 prize. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tony nominating committee evidently had no such qualms about "Twilight," 
but to further confuse the general public, some will notice that while 
"Twilight" is one of the four Broadway plays up for best play (along with Tony 
Kushner's "Perestroika," Robert Schenkkan's "The Kentucky Cycle" and Arthur 
Miller's "Broken Glass"), the play that won this year's Pulitzer, Edward 
Albee's "Three Tall Women," is not represented tonight. That's because "Three 
Tall Women" is playing Off Broadway, and the Tonys stubbornly limit themselves 
(yes, still) to shows playing inside the geographical boundaries of the 
historic theater district in houses with at least 500 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to theater awards, it's good to keep in mind that there are 
often matters of real estate involved, and in the case of the Pulitzer, the 
internal politics of the jury. Regardless, the debate over "Twilight's" 
worthiness for these traditional honors is not so surprising given that it 
seems to be a wholly new form, dazzling but unfamiliar -- and therefore a 
challenge and threat to established boundaries of official approbation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the debate is confounding all the same to those who believe that the first 
measure of any play or theater work -- especially in today's beleaguered 
theater world -- is whether it makes itself felt so strongly that people want 
to see it. And this certainly was true of "Twilight" in Los Angeles, where in 
its last weeks it broke box-office records for the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a San Francisco-based actress, assembled the two-hour piece from 200 
tape-recorded interviews she conducted with all manner of people involved in or 
affected by the three days of violence and civil disturbance that began April 
29, 1992. She described the intention of "Twilight" as "my search for the 
character of Los Angeles in the wake of the initial Rodney King verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 She revealed that character through her uncanny impersonations of roughly two 
dozen of the people she had interviewed, stretching her talent for mimicry from 
the voices of public figures like Reginald O. Denny, Daryl Gates and Stanley 
Sheinbaum to anonymous citizens white, black and brown. In a series of 
fast-moving monologues, she painted a swirling collage of a city at war with 
itself. And she did this, under the circumstances, with a considerable amount 
of humor and entertainment value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The effect Smith achieved onstage was impressive, but what was she doing 
exactly? Or did it matter what we called it? It was not a play like "Our Town" 
or "Death of a Salesman," nor was it a personal monologue of the kinds 
popularized by such writer-actors as Spalding Gray and Eric Bogosian. 
</P>
<P>
 It was nonfiction, but interpretive nonfiction, a theatrical relation perhaps 
to the literary forms of "nonfiction novelists" like Truman Capote, Norman 
Mailer and Joseph Wambaugh who combined reporting with novelistic narratives. 
Who remembers -- probably not this year's Pulitzer jury in drama -- that 
Mailer's 1979 book, "The Executioner's Song," based on many tape-recorded 
interviews, won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction , when most people took it to be 
a nonfiction account of the life and death of convicted murderer Gary Gilmore? 
</P>
<P>
 For that matter, Robert Sherwood's 1938 play, "Abe Lincoln in Illinois," 
borrowed largely from Lincoln's writings and speeches and was awarded the 
Pulitzer. "A Chorus Line," built by Michael Bennett and James Kirkwood from 
interviews with Broadway dancers, won the prize in 1975. There are many more 
examples of successful stage plays -- Jay Presson Allen's "Tru," Eric Bentley's 
"Are You Now or Have You Ever Been?," "The Diary of Anne Frank," by Frances 
Goodrich and Albert Hackett -- that were shaped from the words of real people 
collected from existing writings or transcriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for the roots of Smith's "Twilight" method in so-called "documentary 
theater," one looks all the way back to the fabled Living Newspaper of the 
Federal Theatre Project during the 1930s, the Group Theater's "Waiting for 
Lefty," by Clifford Odets (that addressed the 1937 New York taxi strike) or to 
the earlier Taper shows "In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer" (1968) and 
"The Trial of the Catonsville 9" (1971). There is, of course, the work of Emily 
Mann ("Still Life" and "Execution of Justice"), who directed "Twilight" at the 
Taper. Even so, there seems to be no clear precedent for what Smith has done at 
this professional level. She appears to have established a new genre, and at 
the moment she is a genre of one. This is a mixed blessing at awards time. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also been nominated for best featured actress in "Twilight," but 
traditionalists in the theater may not be ready to grant her full status as a 
writer, as an established older American playwright confided to me recently, 
while requesting anonymity. "It's an eloquent performance all right, but 
there's a lot of concern among Tony voters that it's not a play," said the 
playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Schenkkan, author of "The Kentucky Cycle," which won the 1992 Pulitzer 
and is nominated for a Tony tonight, holds a similar view. "From a 
dramaturgical point of view, it's not a work of the imagination," said 
Schenkkan. "This is not to take anything away from her performance, which is 
amazing. I think of it as performance art, not as a play." 
</P>
<P>
 Others feel differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be an issue for some critics and some people in the 
theater," said Emily Mann, a leading proponent and practitioner of documentary 
theater. "But a lot of writing, if you will, goes into one of these pieces. 
There's an incredible amount of craft involved. You still have to make a play." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was wonderful," said Wendy Wasserstein, the playwright who won 
the Pulitzer in 1989 for "The Heidi Chronicles" and one who speaks up in 
Smith's behalf. "I think of it as a work of art. There is an individual voice 
there, the eye of the observer. It's constructed in a theatrical way. It moves. 
It's documentary theater but it's different from 'docudrama' because she's 
dealing with character. It begins with character, which is what it has in 
common with a lot of other plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Moore, who directed the Pulitzer-winning " 'night Mother" on Broadway and 
the radio documentary play "Top Secret: The Battle for the Pentagon Papers" for 
L.A. Theatre Works, said about "Twilight": "It's the way one shapes reality 
that makes theater. Not anyone could come up with a way of doing that. There's 
an argument to be made that she did write part of it since she asked the 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theater is becoming a form that no one thinks is relevant, and here is a 
piece that has shown relevance and vibrancy, that is important, clever and 
well-done. So why in the world should it be excluded?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That connection that is made between the stage and an audience and between 
the audience and the artist, that is what the theater is about," said Lloyd 
Richards, director of August Wilson's plays "Fences" (Pulitzer, 1987) and "The 
Piano Lesson" and for 30 years director the National Playwrights Conference. 
Did he consider "Twilight" a play? "Categorizing it is something that's imposed 
on it. It's not what the art is about. One can say about something, what is the 
creative element in it? Sometimes assemblage is creative. I was moved or I was 
provoked or I was enraged or I was entertained by it. That's where it's at." 
</P>
<P>
 Oskar Eustis, a director at the Taper who worked with Smith as an adviser 
during the development of "Twilight," made this observation: "Categories are 
invented before an art form is invented. When you have category confusion, the 
artists are usually ahead of the judges." 
</P>
<P>
 During the years he was running the Eureka Theatre in San Francisco, Eustis 
commissioned and directed "Execution of Justice," about the trial of Dan White, 
the man who murdered San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and city Supervisor 
Harvey Milk. "Just the act of putting on that play for that community over and 
over again was an act of reliving these events that we had so far failed to 
process," he said. "And thus we made in the theater an event take place that 
could only happen in the theater. You needed to be surrounded by other people 
from the same community. You couldn't be sitting in front of your television 
set." 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition of taking real-life events and finding a way to put them on the 
stage that both reflects the immediacy of news reporting and the thematic 
complexity of a work of art is one of the ways theater has of being different 
from the museum or the ballet, he pointed out. "It's a grubby, immediate art 
form, and yet it is an art form." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There remains the question about "Twilight": Will it last? Shouldn't the 
projected durability of a play or book or movie be a measure of its greatness 
or lack thereof? Probably, except that this is the most difficult of all 
standards to apply with any accuracy, given a glance at history. How many 
"classics" of just the last 25 years in the theater already qualify as answers 
to trivia questions? 
</P>
<P>
 "Twilight" seems a piece very much of the moment, an address to a city by a 
visitor who spent some time here and summed up her thoughts for the stage. But 
should this diminish its value? The Pulitzer jury concluded that Smith's work 
"is not reproducible by other performers because it relies for its authenticity 
on the performer's having done those interviews." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith herself disputes this conclusion and reasoning. But call it truth or 
call it fiction, it is hard to imagine an Anna Deavere Smith show without Anna 
Deavere Smith. Trying to read "Twilight" is only a little more fruitful than 
trying to read "A Chorus Line" or "Phantom of the Opera." And in any case the 
published version differs significantly both from the staged version seen at 
the Taper and the one now on Broadway, which was altered again under a new 
director, George C. Wolfe, adding new characters (including a laughing Keith 
Watson, co-assailant of Reginald O. Denny).  
</P>
<P>
 In a way, this continuous tinkering is just an additional problem for anyone 
trying to measure Smith for a formal gown of respectability. Because she is up 
to something else, asking audiences and the authorities to look at theater 
fundamentally as a work in progress, taking place one night at a time. This is 
possibly a radical idea.

 Four years into the county foster care system, Jason grew so distraught about 
the child abuse he had suffered from his parents that he contemplated suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was placed under the care of his grandmother, Jason -- then 12 -- 
still longed for an affectionate relationship with his mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt so abandoned," said the 18-year-old Compton youth, who plans to 
attend Santa Monica Community College in the fall. "Having to not be with my 
parents every day, that was the hardest thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, his grandmother and a newfound faith in God filled that void and 
gave Jason hope "to go on with my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason's words echoed a common theme among the 118 college-bound foster youths 
who recently received recognition for their personal triumphs at the fifth 
annual "Independent Living Celebration" at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The 
celebration marked their "graduation" from the foster care system.  
</P>
<P>
 Co-sponsored by the county Department of Children's Services and the United 
Friends of the Children organization, Monday's event drew nearly 200 people. 
Hollywood stars such as Henry Winkler and Whoopi Goldberg also made 
appearances.  
</P>
<P>
 All of the students have earned grade-point averages of 3.0 or higher. Eleven 
received scholarships ranging from $2,000 to $5,000, while the rest were 
awarded smaller amounts to help cover their living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the 118 foster youths came into the system mainly as 
victims of physical or sexual abuse from parents. They have also experienced 
neglect from parents who are drug users. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some were battered, some were molested, some were just out-and-out abandoned 
(and) some were so severely deprived of food and shelter that we had to step 
in," said Peter Digre, director of children's services. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster youths become independent adults and are no longer supported by 
children's services once they reach 18 or have earned a high school diploma. In 
the meantime, they are encouraged to complete a voluntary Independent Living 
Program -- a series of classes that prepares students for such everyday 
responsibilities as balancing a checkbook, cooking and finding housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on previous children's services studies, 30% of foster teens go on to 
college, 40% enter the work force and 30% drop out of college, lose their jobs 
or wind up homeless, Digre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noella, an 18-year-old Dorsey High student, already chose to step out of the 
foster care system earlier this year and into the "real world." She works at 
the high school to pay her monthly rent of $450. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty scary," said the youth, who has been accepted to USC's computer 
engineering program. "But this (Independent Living) program gives you the 
ability to deal with your fear, to face it head-on." TOMMY LI

<P>
 A community group is planning a rally Saturday outside the Hall of 
Administration to protest the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's proposed 
hike in bus fares and cutbacks in service. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration outside 500 W. Temple St. is scheduled for 9:15 a.m., about 
an hour before the MTA board is expected to meet, said Lisa Duran, an organizer 
for the Labor/Community Watchdog organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're planning is to have a coffin to represent the demise of the bus 
system," Duran said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Labor/Community Watchdog organization of union and non-union officials and 
residents wants the MTA to stop all future Metro Rail construction and instead 
pour its resources into the bus system. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials insist that service cutbacks and a 25-cent increase in the bus 
fare, from $1.10 to $1.35, are necessary to meet a $126-million shortfall in a 
proposed $647.4-million operating budget. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; STUDENTS USE ISRAEL TRIP TO DISPEL MYTHS

 Rising at 4:30 a.m. to harvest bananas for six hours may hardly seem like a 
vacation. But for 10 Los Angeles high school students who spent two months on a 
kibbutz in Israel, it made for an experience of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest thing was the people," said 17-year-old Shawn Taylor, a 
Roosevelt High School senior who is sharing her experiences with classmates. 
"Everyone worked really hard together. . . . We felt very accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw High School student Rochelle Brown said the hard work was only a 
small part of a rich tapestry of experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really going to miss my new family," she said with a sigh, clutching a 
small silver hamsah -- a gift from her adopted Israeli sister -- hanging from a 
chain around her neck. "I can't wait to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor and Brown were among the students from Roosevelt and Crenshaw high 
schools chosen to make the trip to Israel in April to experience firsthand the 
communal life of a Jewish kibbutz. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip was sponsored by Operation Unity, a nonprofit group founded in 1991 
by journalist Cookie Lommel to improve relations between African Americans and 
Jews. Lommel opened the trip to Latinos to give them a chance to learn about a 
culture that she says is probably more foreign to them than to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky de la Paz, 18, said the trip gave him the chance to see something very 
close to his heart that he never thought he would: the Holy Land. "That was 
like . . . Wow!" said the Crenshaw senior, grinning and spreading his hands to 
indicate the enormity of the experience. "We saw all these big temples. I felt 
high, I felt great. I'm like a new person now."  
</P>
<P>
 Lommel, who is African American, said she was inspired to start the trips 
after traveling to Israel three years ago and witnessing the warm interaction 
between Ethiopian Jews and their Israeli counterparts. She said she also wanted 
young people to see that the Middle East is not the war-ravaged, fractured land 
presented by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown acknowledged that her parents had doubts about sending her off to Israel 
after the Feb. 25 massacre of 48 Muslims by Jewish extremists in Hebron. "I 
used to think that (Israel) was a bad place, but I learned firsthand that it's 
nothing like that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students lived with families on Kibbutz Beit Zera, about a mile south of the 
Sea of Galilee. They tended bananas and other fruits and vegetables, and worked 
in plastics factories. In their free time they visited such places as the Red 
Sea, the Dead Sea, Jerusalem and the West Bank. They also visited Arab and 
other families. 
</P>
<P>
 For 17-year-old Ivan Lopez, a Crenshaw senior, one of the high points was 
unearthing an artifact during an archeological dig at Bet Guvrin, outside of 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found a Greek perfume bottle thousands of years old," Lopez said proudly. 
"I couldn't keep it, but it was great. I never thought I'd find anything." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing the students did find was a sense of community they say is sorely 
lacking in their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt really good to be a part of the (Israeli) society," said Taylor. 
"They were very together. . . . We could learn from that and make this world a 
much better place." ERIN J. AUBRY

WHEN THE WOLF HOWLS; PLEASE DON'T CONFINE JIM HARRISON. ONE DAY HE'LL TAKE IN 
THE SOLITUDE OF A RUSTIC CABIN, THE NEXT HE'LL ENJOY THE SWANK DIGS OF A 
BIG-TIME SCREENWRITER FOR HIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WALKER, Michael Walker is a frequent contributor to Calender. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By popular fiat, "serious" poets and novelists are supposed to while away 
their publish-or-perish years flogging Chaucer to boneheaded university 
freshmen or reveling in the pinched glory of appearing in the Sewanee River 
Review. They are not, generally speaking, expected to occupy a suite at the 
Westwood Marquis on the Columbia Pictures tab, take meetings with Mike Nichols 
or collapse in Jack Nicholson's hot tub at day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harrison has done all of the above. Virtually alone among his 
contemporaries, the 56-year-old novelist and poet has maintained his formidable 
literary standing while pursuing a lucrative second career as a screenwriter, 
making him one of the most prosperous citizens of Lake Leelanau, the hamlet in 
northern Michigan where the native Midwesterner lives most of the year on a 
farm outside of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make up stories, or 'fibs' as my mother calls them," Harrison says in his 
rasping Midwestern burr. "Now, Sony's got about 100 million bucks into my fibs 
this year," referring to three separate, front-burner projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harrison canon thus far includes six novels, three collections of novellas 
(including the just-published "Julip"), seven volumes of poetry and assorted 
journalism, most famously a riotously discursive "food" column for Esquire that 
was retired last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's books sell especially well in Los Angeles ("a riverless city of 
redolent and banal sobs," he wrote in a poem) and, to his bewilderment, in 
France, where he has met children named after the heroine of "Dalva," his 
celebrated 1988 novel about a woman searching for the son she gave up as a 
teen-ager. Such is Harrison's stature there that French documentary filmmakers 
voyaged to Lake Leelanau to capture the writer in his lair. "They told me it 
would take five days and it took nine teen ," Harrison groans. "By which time I 
was ready to take out my .270 (shotgun) and blow them away." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's characters are often unsung folk with steely, contemplative 
constitutions -- farmers, country doctors, schoolteachers, bridge-builders, 
Native Americans, a woman fleeing her husband at an interstate truck stop -- 
their surroundings acutely observed, sometimes through the keen eyes of 
coyotes, wolves and raven. Harrison is "a writer with immortality in him," 
declared the Sunday Times of London; "one of the few truly high-test males 
who've passed through the eye of the needle," noted Ms. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hollywood keeps luring Harrison west, where his pungent 
storytelling is in steady demand, even if he characterizes these forays as 
"butting my head into the movie industry with the kind of non-directional 
energy that characterizes boobs from the Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
 "I only seem to be able to write a book every 2 1/2 years," Harrison says, 
"and when I get done I have a considerable amount of overflow energy that other 
people use in teaching, but I don't teach. Usually, that's when I do my good 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Columbia will release the Mike Nichols-directed "Wolf" -- unrelated 
to Harrison's first novel, "Wolf: A False Memoir" -- from Harrison's screenplay 
(co-written by Wesley Strick) about a man, played by Nicholson, who transforms 
into the film's namesake. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson and Harrison (who is also credited as associate producer of the 
film), now close friends, were introduced in 1975 by novelist Thomas McGuane on 
the set of "The Missouri Breaks," for which McGuane had written the screenplay. 
Nicholson, a fan of Harrison's early books, staked the then-struggling novelist 
$50,000 to write "Legends of the Fall," a suite of novellas published in 1979 
that sold strongly and snagged Harrison a screenwriting contract with Warner 
Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 One story from that trilogy, "Revenge," was released as a movie in 1990, 
starring Kevin Costner and Madeleine Stowe. The film adaptation of the title 
novella from "Legends of the Fall," directed by Ed Zwick and starring Brad Pitt 
for TriStar, is shaping up as one of this autumn's big movies. "Dalva" is in 
development, and yet another film project -- which Harrison will only describe 
as "fresh, like a pink-assed baby" -- has brought him to the suite at the 
Westwood Marquis and a round of script meetings, or, as he prefers, "three days 
in the dentist's chair." 
</P>
<P>
 With longtime agent and Michigan State classmate Bob Dattila at his side, 
Harrison steps off the elevator into the lobby, eager to tear into the hotel's 
buffet luncheon. Although he is descended from Swedes and speaks with the upper 
Midwest's strangled diphthongs, Harrison's black cowboy boots, Pancho Villa 
mustache and swarthy complexion lend him the air of a Colombian coffee baron. 
Add to that a longshoreman's physique and a glass left eye -- the real one put 
out by a female playmate during a game of doctor when Harrison was 7 -- and 
it's easy to understand why he is sometimes mistaken for Nicholson's bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Harrison is somewhat shy in the manner of a tamed bear, a creature, 
along with wolves and other free spirits, he holds in awe. "People keep 
misquoting Thoreau: 'In wilderness is the preservation of the world,' " he 
says. "But it's wildness -- he never said wilderness. All of our reality is 
shaped to get us to work on time. Wolves aren't involved in that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A conversation with Harrison is inevitably punctuated by his wheezing, 
cackling laughter, especially when the subject takes a particularly absurd 
turn, such as Thomas Mann's flirtation with screenwriting in the '30s. "Jim's 
got a great sense of humor -- he talks just like he writes," says Norm Wheeler, 
a schoolteacher friend from Michigan. "He can go from a sailor joke to a line 
of poetry in the same sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked behind a table with Dattila in the hotel dining room, Harrison broods 
over the news that his cherished buffet has been banished to Sundays. "We're 
hungry as pigs," he tells a waiter, scanning the menu disconsolately. Besides 
his meandering 10,000-mile car trips and the blissful solitude of his cabin 
near Grand Marais, on the Lake Superior shore of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, 
Harrison's most enduring distraction is food, so much so that he has 
contemplated rigging his fork, knife and spoon with tiny lights and having 
himself filmed eating in a darkened room. Invariably, the aromas of food and 
beverage waft from his reminiscences, from the fiery pasta puttanesca he shared 
with Federico Fellini to the sodden orgy of beluga, salmon, sweetbreads, leg of 
lamb and assorted wines, desserts, cheeses and ports that Orson Welles pressed 
upon him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to eat well and not die from it -- for the simple reason that 
that would be the end of my eating," he once wrote in Esquire. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the thing that's least likely to make me feel sleepy?" Harrison is 
asking Dattila, mindful of a 3:30 script meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caesar salad," the agent murmurs. "Chicken salad . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "ARRRRGH," groans Harrison, who settles on veal and "white wine, dry -- maybe 
I can get away with one glass." 
</P>
<P>
 One more glass will arrive before the end of lunch, a virtual bender by 
Hollywood's current standards of mineral-water piety. When Harrison came to 
Hollywood, in the late '70s, meals with the film colony were liberally 
irrigated with spirits and garnished with blasts of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, "you can't afford to drink too much out here because you have to 
keep alert. The texture of the town is such that I would never ordinarily have 
a glass of wine with lunch if I was having a meeting, and I love wine. You have 
to treat it like you're in the woods and there actually are grizzlies. Because 
you don't do well out here if you (expletive) up. It's an extraordinarily 
unforgiving town." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison readily acknowledges that Hollywood has, by most standards, been 
remarkably kind to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a little leg up here, being a novelist," he says. "They even invite 
you to their homes. What would not be nice is a novelist coming out here 
without being invited." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison's entree was smoothed by Nicholson, McGuane (a friend from his 
Michigan State days) and Warner Bros. then-chief John Calley. "Oddly, a lot of 
the big talents in the business have found Jim," agent Dattila says. "Jack 
Nicholson, Tom Cruise, Robert Redford -- their people call up saying: 'We read 
this guy. What's he got?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Studios are corporations, like publishers," Harrison says. "Sometimes they 
treat you quite wonderfully. And sometimes they're like a rich uncle with 
severe Alzheimer's. And you don't know in any given week which it's going to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a directors' medium. You're crazy if you don't comprehend that. Also, a 
writer has to get used to the fact this is a totally collaborative thing. If I 
write a novel, nobody gets to touch it. My older daughter edits it and we send 
it off and that's it. John Huston said you're lost in this business unless you 
can see the whole movie topographically. You've got to be able to do that or 
you're going to fall apart, or depend on prayer. This isn't the arena of 
prayer." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Despite having cast his line into Hollywood's waters for 15 years now, 
Harrison still marvels that the bait can, in effect, tell the fisherman to go 
jump in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I lost 150 grand here, which I could have written a novel on, just 
because an actress didn't show up for a meeting," he says. "Three times in a 
row she didn't show, and that blew it. Who's stable enough to deal with that? 
Well, I am now, but I wasn't for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 That was in the early '80s, when, stunned by the success of "Legends" and his 
first Hollywood money, Harrison began a round of hard living. "I behaved 
badly," he admits. "I like to think I was the Leon Spinks of American 
literature." Says friend Norm Wheeler: "Suddenly he had big money and could fly 
around and indulge himself. Which he did." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Harrison confesses, "my drug price got to be about the same as 
my script price." With the help of his family and a therapist, he gradually 
righted himself, ditching cocaine completely and halving his drinking. He 
discovered that the long nights and feeble sunshine of northern Michigan's 
winters had caused him to have bouts with depression, so he now winters in a 
casita on an Arizona horse farm near the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 Between these measures, his lengthy daily walks and "constant, relentless 
discipline," Harrison says he has been clear for seven years of the depression 
that once brought him to grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still believe most in Jung, who says depression comes from trying to live 
too high in the mind," he says. "You get up there and you almost don't have an 
exit, like a bird caught in a granary. He doesn't know the way out is down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I can't wait to take a little walk." It's midmorning on a Saturday, and 
Harrison is padding around the living room of his suite, where the dregs of his 
room-service breakfast molder on starched linen and a spyglass rests on the 
credenza. A view of the UCLA Botanical Gardens beckons through the open 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was too long a day yesterday," Harrison says -- an "incredibly intense" 
three-hour script session followed by a lengthy dinner at Dan Tana's that ended 
"at 2 sharp. I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison is still digesting the news that his publisher, Seymour Lawrence, has 
died unexpectedly. "I hadn't had a real hangover in two years, but old Sam," he 
says with a sigh. "Sam was always thought to be the last gentleman in 
publishing. He was grand to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison was born in Grayling, Mich., in 1937. His father, a country 
agricultural agent with a taste for literature, inculcated in his son a deep 
regard both for nature and great writers. "My father was an inordinately bright 
country man, extremely widely read," Harrison recalls. When, at 16, Harrison 
told him he wanted to be a writer, "my dad thought that was a fabulous thing to 
be. He bought a $15 typewriter for me, so I didn't have that agonizing 
disapproval that some young writers get." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the spell of James Joyce and Arthur Rimbaud, Harrison and a friend drove 
from Michigan to Greenwich Village "to be bohemians for three days. We bought a 
pint of cognac and stayed at this cheap little hotel. We told the bellhop, 'We 
would like a prostitute.' So we got one and she was very charming and 
understood the whole situation. She says, 'Oh! Cognac. You boys must be very 
sophisticated.' It was lovely. Then I had to go back and be a junior in high 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 A reluctant student, Harrison eventually collected a bachelor's in English and 
a master's degree in comparative literature from Michigan State, and in 1960 he 
married classmate Linda King, whom he'd met when he was 16. His first book of 
poems, "Plain Song," was published while he was still a student. After 
completing his master's, he taught at the State University of New York at Stony 
Brook for a single grueling year before moving back to Michigan with his wife 
and daughter Jamie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't vaguely fit into an academic community," Harrison says, now parked, 
ironically enough, on a bench on the UCLA campus. "There's something attenuated 
about it. I can't stand life when I know everything that's going to happen to 
me -- I can't make endless aimless car trips or just do what I want. It's 
grotesquely discouraging." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Michigan, Harrison supported his family with grant money, the meager 
earnings of his first poetry and occasional articles about fishing and hunting 
for Sports Illustrated. By 1975, he had published "Wolf: A False Memoir" and "A 
Good Day to Die" and had high hopes for "Farmer," his third novel, about a 
Michigan high school teacher torn between the affections of his middle-aged 
girlfriend and a neurotic student. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farmer" received good notices but sold abysmally. One edition, improperly 
bound, literally fell apart in readers' hands. The book's disintegration, real 
and figurative, crushed Harrison. "I felt it was my best work," he says. "I got 
one paperback offer of $1,200 and turned it down. What was the point?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison was heavily in debt -- with a second daughter, Anna, to support -- 
and his future seemed unrelievedly grim. Four years later, with the help of 
Nicholson's grant, he published "Legends of the Fall." When the sales of film 
rights were added, the book pushed Harrison's earnings from $12,000 to $650,000 
in a single year. The sum was inconceivable to the son of a county agricultural 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way, if you make hundreds of times more in a year than your father 
did, to rationalize that you are, at least in American terms, sort of 
successful," Harrison says. "I was writing the same way as when I wrote 
'Farmer' and I didn't get anything. Then I write ("Legends") and I get 
everything. Success, particularly in America, is deeply irrational that way. 
It's a shuddering elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody says to me that they think I'm successful," Harrison adds, 
swiveling his head to and fro on the park bench in a who-me? pantomime, "I 
always look around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a grippingly cold, damp spring night in Brentwood. Harrison, one hand 
clutching a microphone, stands before a lectern in the courtyard outside 
Dutton's bookstore, reading from "The Beige Dolorosa," one of his new novellas. 
For an hour, he signed books inside the store, a pint of V.O. stashed 
discreetly by his side, a cigarette bouncing in the corner of his mouth, as he 
scrawled his name over and over and growled charmingly, 'Thank you, that's very 
nice of you," as the books and accolades were shoved his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in this wind-swept courtyard, with the traffic on San Vicente threatening 
to drown out his voice, 100 or so of Harrison's fans listen raptly as he reads 
his words about a college professor whose life is derailed by a P.C.-addled 
female undergrad. When Harrison arrived, a trill of recognition ran among them 
much the way they might have reacted had one of Harrison's high-profile 
Hollywood cronies shown up at the reading. None of them did. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, then, is the flip side of Harrison's all-expenses-paid screenwriter's 
life: the artist, his thin blue blazer flapping in the wind, amid the faithful 
who unstintingly follow his career, anticipate the new books, care enough to 
stand in the cold and dark and watch him, flanked by a nervous bookstore 
employee who shines a flashlight over his shoulder, as he reads the writing 
that they love. Here, at this modest affair, in the heart of a town where 
writers earn more for a two-page film treatment than for a book but are treated 
as interchangeable cogs in an oily machine, Jim Harrison is, in the end, just 
another novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, back at his hotel suite, Harrison had chuckled, saying: "Don't you 
love the way novelists are portrayed in movies? They've got no visuals for 
writers. My endless divarications of prose aren't possible in a screenplay. And 
you can't film a guy sitting there thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison had paused. "I mean, you can," he added. "But it's not a lot of fun 
to watch."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; UGANDA KING DETAILS AIDS CRISIS IN AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Robinsons May, on the verge of reopening after months of earthquake damage 
repair, had a very special first guest visit its spruced-up facilities: the 
king of Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
 But His Majesty Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II was hardly there to inspect the 
premises. The 39-year-old spiritual leader of the east African nation made a 
stop June 3 at the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza to raise local awareness about 
the AIDS crisis in Africa, particularly in his country. 
</P>
<P>
 "HIV infection is estimated at 10% of people in Uganda, which is much greater 
than in the United States," Mutebi told a crowd assembled in the Museum of 
African American Art on the store's second level. "Imagine a country the size 
of Minnesota with 10,000 new cases of AIDS to absorb each month. This is what 
we are facing." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from several AIDS and health organizations, including the Black AIDS 
Commission and the Ugandan AIDS project, spoke on behalf of Mutebi's effort. 
Uganda Project founder Canon James Larthrop pointed out the orphan problem that 
is becoming a tragic part of the AIDS devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two million men and women in Uganda have AIDS, and (in the United States), 
there are about 300,000 cases diagnosed," said Larthrop, who works jointly with 
the Anglican Church in Uganda on the project. "There are hundreds of thousands 
of orphaned children. Who's going to raise them?" 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) said that it was time blacks of all 
nations realized that AIDS is taking its greatest toll on those of African 
descent. "In this neighborhood, it was a long time before we felt that AIDS 
would touch our lives," she said. "But it's spreading faster now. We must focus 
and stop our people from dying." 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving a $5,200 check from Robinsons May Manager Joyce Mack for the 
Ugandan AIDS Project, Mutebi urged guests to read more about the seriousness of 
the Ugandan situation and donate what they could, from money to medical 
supplies to clean sheets, to help stop the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to Uganda," Mutebi said, "America still has time to educate and help 
its citizens to change their behavior." A week after Mutebi's visit, Robinsons 
May reopened to the general public. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LEIMERT PARK; FESTIVAL FEATURES CAMEROON CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leimert Park, the unofficial center of African and African American arts in 
Los Angeles, got a cultural boost last week from a faraway source: Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 150 Cameroonian artists have set up camp in a miniature African village 
in Leimert Park for a week of exhibits, music and dance performances. Although 
the festival is being held in conjunction with World Cup soccer, which includes 
the Cameroonian team, the Indomitable Lions, organizers say their larger goal 
is raising awareness about this Central African nation and its traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a great opportunity for a cultural exchange," said Nana 
Maynard of Los Angeles, one of the organizers of the festival, officially 
dubbed Cameroon for USA '94. "We don't need governments or any other excuse to 
come together." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival kicked off Friday after event volunteers constructed a tent-like 
village on the grassy expanse of Leimert Park at Crenshaw Boulevard and 43rd 
Place. Art exhibits, performances by the dance troupe Ballet Moderne and singer 
Coco Ateba will continue daily through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynard calls the project a "miracle in motion" because the event gelled in a 
matter of weeks on a shoestring budget. Officials at Jemea, a Cameroonian 
cultural promotion outfit, are footing most of the bill for the trip, about 
$150,000, and most of the accommodations for artists have been arranged at USC 
and at private homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jemea began scouting for Los Angeles residents to help produce the event two 
months ago, after director Henri Manga fell in love with the idea of bringing a 
little bit of Africa to America, using the World Cup as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say we were sort of commandeered into it," publicist Ginger 
Campbell said with a laugh. "But it was such an exciting thing, you could 
hardly say no." 
</P>
<P>
 Jemea, which means "will" or "determination" in the Cameroonian language of 
Duola, pulled together a team of about 20 producers here to organize the Los 
Angeles aspects of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Sequoia Mercier was named Jemea representative in California, a role 
the Crenshaw resident said has engulfed her life for the past several months 
but one she says has been worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really captured me was the fact they wanted to bring so many artists 
here at once," said Mercier, a nurse. "They wanted to introduce the whole world 
to Cameroon . . . so I said I would play matchmaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Said architect Manga Duolla-Bell, a Jemea employee from Cameroon who designed 
the village and oversaw construction: "I chose Leimert Park because of its 
artistic personality and its African feel. It seemed the perfect place to bring 
both the African and American cultures together."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; A GOOFY LESSON IN BUSINESS SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the second-floor hallway of Utah Street Elementary School last Wednesday, 
third-grade students hawked jewelry, buttons, paper hats, food, games and 
offered to style hair. 
</P>
<P>
 They were vying for "goofies," the currency of their after-school program that 
taught them to connect their daily math and reading lessons with the real world 
of commerce. After four months of learning how to establish their businesses, 
they held a bazaar to earn more goofies and divide up the earnings with 
business partners and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rainbow Restaurant! Step right in!" yelled Roxana Valdez, 9, who wore a 
hair-covering to protect her fare of nachos, pizza, popcorn and punch from her 
long tresses. "It's so famous! It's so rich!" 
</P>
<P>
 Other students tried to get the attention of potential customers among other 
after-school students who had earned goofies -- actually, red raffle tickets -- 
to spend through good behavior and turning in their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Delgadillo, 9, and her business partner Evelyn Gomez, 8, sold photo 
buttons that sported pictures of classmates and teachers. Their employees, 
Elizabeth Vazquez, Augustin Solorzano and Mario Ramirez, all 8, formed a 
production line behind them to stamp out the buttons just right. Some were less 
than perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "See this one that's upside down? It costs three goofies," said Elizabeth, who 
inspected the buttons and priced them between two and six goofies. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Mayra Fernandez, who has taught for 27 years, started the after-school 
program in January when she noticed that her third-grade students were not at 
the level they should have been. She met with parents and asked if she could 
keep the students until 5:30 p.m. three days a week and started helping the 
students build their business enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to teach children in the concrete what they have learned 
academically," Fernandez said. "To make the hats, I would ask them to cut out a 
3-foot square of paper and they would ask, 'What's a square?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Each business owner had to apply for a license and pay for it with goofies 
earned in class. Students could also lose their goofies through fines for 
behavior such as throwing paper (a fine of 10 goofies), name-calling (three 
goofies) or needlessly going to the bathroom (five goofies). 
</P>
<P>
 "It has reduced trips to the bathroom by 90%," Fernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
 The lesson in capitalism also has taught Fernandez a thing or two. Students 
who had lost goofies to the point of having to turn over every one earned to 
pay off debts showed signs of becoming disconnected from the classroom society, 
she said. And the "millionaires" also became disconnected from the classroom 
when they started paying off classmates to do chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've learned in here is already out there in the business world," she 
said. "My kids have re-created embezzlement and classism."  
</P>
<P>
 In the Rainbow Restaurant, 8-year-old chef Alfredo Martinez burned a finger 
making popcorn. He busied himself putting plates of nachos in a toaster oven 
while Carolina Gonzalez, 9, hurried to serve cups of punch to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hallway, Rosario Olivares, 9, and business partner Cynthia Sierra, 8, 
counted "100-something" goofies they earned selling beaded necklaces, bracelets 
and rings. The colorful baubles were presented in boxes lined with matching 
tissue paper and by day's end, there were only a few left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little bit hard," Rosario said of the manufacturing process. "The 
beads kept falling down." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Cynthia, wearing a purple lace dress, counted their earnings, she 
shouted, "Ooh-la-la!" MARY ANNE PEREZ

COVER STORY; AFTER ALL, LIFE ISN'T JUST A VIDEO; MTV, THE CHANNEL THAT MADE ITS 
NAME WITH WALL-TO-WALL MUSIC VIDEOS, HAS BECOME A FULL-SERVICE 'LIFESTYLE 
NETWORK,' MUCH TO THE CONSTERNATION OF THE BIG RECORD COMPANIES, WHICH ARE 
TEAMING UP TO LAUNCH THEIR OWN CHANNEL

 Jack Noseworthy, wearing bulky black boots and a ripped green army jacket with 
sleeves hanging past his hands, storms after Lisa Dean Ryan inside the faded 
gold lobby of the Belasco Theatre in downtown Los Angeles. She looks like a 
waif, with her dark hair chopped short and her belly bare under the peace 
flower emblazoned on her cutoff T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The two actors are shooting the new half-hour TV series "Dead at 21," MTV's 
first foray into action-adventure that might best be described as grunge on the 
run. They are playing Ed and Maria, two tattered 20-year-olds who are framed 
for murder and must stay one step ahead of a mad-dog federal agent while 
searching desperately for the doctor who implanted a computer chip in Ed's 
skull when he was born as part of a 1970s government plot to create super-smart 
human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Ed, the patients -- or neuro-cybernauts, as they're called 
-- self-destruct when they reach adulthood at the age of 21. 
</P>
<P>
 All the head-banging action, shot on 16-millimeter film throughout Southern 
California, is played out on screen like an extended music video -- with 
extreme hand-held camera movement, colorful lighting, fast cuts and strobe 
effects, backed by a constant stream of music that ranges from the Spin Doctors 
to Enya to Smashing Pumpkins to Snoop Doggy Dogg. The series airs Wednesdays at 
10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Noseworthy grabs Ryan's arm and spins her around on her platform heels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should help him," he says, referring to Maria's father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed, that man stole me from my mom when I was a baby . He told me she was dead 
when she was alive. Just so I could help him run his cons," she counters. "I 
could have known her, Ed. I could have known my mom before she died." 
</P>
<P>
 Circling the two actors is a camera operator, Harry Garvin, moving into their 
faces and back out, tilting the camera on his shoulders from side to side like 
a lolling ship at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to say," Noseworthy says. "But I do know what it feels like 
to lose a family, and if you've got a chance to patch things up, I think you 
should take it." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trouble, Ed, and he's gonna get us in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Displaced from their parents. Distrusting authority. Dismissed by a society 
pitted against them. And adulthood spells death. In many ways, "Dead at 21" is 
the ultimate teen-age paranoia come to life. And that's exactly how the 
producers hope to hook the nation's alienated youth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not the only way. Executives at MTV are exploring an increasing 
number of entertainment alternatives to capture the wandering eyeballs and 
imaginations of young viewers these days. The basic cable channel that made an 
indelible stamp on pop culture in the 1980s by playing wall-to-wall music 
videos and specials has slowly expanded into a full-service "lifestyle network" 
to maintain the legions of followers it created over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV is now running its first scripted drama series, "Catwalk," chronicling the 
ups and downs of a struggling garage band. A real-life soap opera, "The Real 
World," and a sketch comedy series, "The State," are prepping new seasons. 
MTV's late-night talk show, "The Jon Stewart Show," has been so well received 
that Viacom, MTV's parent company, is trying to sell it into broadcast 
syndication to replace "The Arsenio Hall Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's a game show ("Trashed") in which contestants compete to destroy 
each other's property. A sports magazine ("MTV Sports") with radical footage of 
in-line skaters, surfers and mountain bikers. A news program ("Week in Rock") 
whose chief correspondent, Tabitha Soren, is on a first-name basis with 
President Clinton. A concert series ("MTV Unplugged") that has spawned platinum 
record albums. A fashion show ("House of Style") hosted by super-model Cindy 
Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 And did we mention "Beavis and Butt-head," the two cretinous cartoon 
characters who -- heh-heh-heh -- are the scourge of parents and educators 
everywhere? 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fans look forward to seeing the new ideas we try," said Joe Davola, 
senior vice president of MTV Productions and MTV Development, who is now 
overseeing the development of MTV's first sitcom. "They're fine if we fail; 
they get upset if we don't try. We have to change. Our audience expects us to 
change. The world changes, so do we. Once we stop, that's when it's over for 
us. We have to keep reinventing ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 But at a price. These different forms of programming have drawn heavy 
criticism from the network's primary supplier -- the recording industry.  
</P>
<P>
 The booming record labels produce music videos to promote and market their 
artists. To them, MTV is a big electronic billboard that has managed to retain 
the rare attention of a restless generation of young people. At least 80% of 
MTV's daily schedule still revolves around music videos, including the 
afternoon and much of prime time, but that's not enough for record executives, 
who are tired of being squeezed out by late-night reruns of "Speed Racer" and 
shows like "Lip Service," a lip-sync talent contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we're at the mercy of MTV," said one senior record executive, 
"and we don't want to be at the mercy of anybody. It's just as simple as that. 
We want another option." 
</P>
<P>
 So four of the six major record companies that normally compete fiercely 
against one another in the $9-billion domestic recording industry have raised 
the white flag to address the issue. Warner Music Group, Sony Software, EMI 
Music and PolyGram Holding, which own or distribute the majority of all music 
released in the world, formed a partnership with Ticketmaster Corp. earlier 
this year to launch their own music video channel by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The record companies will continue to license videos to MTV -- the only 
programmer to pay for music videos -- but they will most likely use their 
channel for exclusive premieres of big videos and to sell tapes, compact discs 
and other merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly there are more music videos made than can go on MTV," said Jordan 
Rost, vice president of marketing for Warner Music Group. "And when MTV puts on 
a program that has content other than music videos, it narrows the number of 
available slots for us. The music industry is not putting out fewer releases 
because MTV decided to add more non-music video programming. Therefore, we know 
our product can fill the time a new channel can provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Record companies are more interested in having a channel with a strong music 
focus, as opposed to a more general lifestyle focus for the young adult 
audience. We want to be the cable channel purely dedicated to music." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MTV professes not to be worried by the potential competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to stay ahead of the curve. We have never stopped planning and 
experimenting," countered Judy McGrath, president and creative director of MTV, 
who sees programming explorations as an important part of MTV's unique identity 
in a marketplace suddenly humming with music video outlets. "I firmly believe 
the competition for MTV is going to come from some kid sitting at home in his 
garage or behind his computer, who has really fresh ideas, and somebody decides 
to let him take a shot at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't spend my time worrying about record companies getting together to 
compete with us," she continued, "because I really believe it's a creative 
battle. The goal is to create a music environment that's going to be 
interesting to the audience and bring them in to watch more videos." 
</P>
<P>
 MTV has expanded beyond music videos for numerous reasons -- beginning with 
ratings. TV watching is a habit, and channel executives believe they can 
recruit more loyal viewers by giving them something regular to tune in to. Most 
of the shows produced by MTV get their viewers involved in a way that music 
videos don't -- acting as a giant watering hole for America's youth to gather, 
get information and generally just rock on. 
</P>
<P>
 Original programming also helps make MTV the master of its own destiny, by 
reducing its reliance on the record industry to consistently supply quality 
videos. It makes the channel more visible in TV guides, where for a long time 
MTV wasn't carried because there were no real programs to list. And perhaps 
most important, advertisers are paying a premium to place commercials in such 
heavily promoted shows as "The Real World" and "Beavis and Butt-head," because 
they know kids watch them more intensely than they do an endless montage of 
music videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Sherman, the fledgling writer of the "Dead at 21" pilot, was 22 when the 
network helped him develop his ideas for the show in 1992. He epitomizes the 
split take on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up, I didn't like MTV," he said. "I wanted to listen to 
music and I didn't want to watch music. I became a fan when MTV started doing 
stuff that was programming oriented. A lot of my friends complained that MTV 
was becoming so lame, putting shows on instead of music videos. I said, 'That's 
why I'm watching it.' Different people enjoy different things." 
</P>
<P>
 MTV launched in 1981 with 250 music videos. For a number of years, when there 
were few cable channels and music videos were a novelty and Michael Jackson was 
a thriller, MTV's ratings were competitive with other major cable networks. MTV 
was promoted as a beachhead for channel surfers. During commercials on other 
channels, people were encouraged to flip over to catch a quick music video on 
MTV, the first real channel for the remote-control age. 
</P>
<P>
 But while MTV's prestige soared, its ratings plummeted. They only started to 
show signs of recovery in the last two years, when the network really started 
pushing different forms of programming. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first quarter of this year, roughly 236,000 homes were watching MTV in 
the average quarter-hour throughout the day, with 354,000 tuning in during 
prime time. That's a low number compared to basic cable's top-rated network, 
Turner Network Television, with an average of 1.5 million homes watching last 
month during prime time. But MTV's numbers are actually up 18% from the first 
quarter a year ago, according to network officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing MTV found about programming music videos -- you're basically 
encouraging viewers to shut you off," said Erica Gruen, a senior vice president 
and cable buyer at the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi in New York. "When 
you give them bits and pieces, you can't sustain their interest for a 
half-hour, an hour or more. That was their whole premise when they started: 
We're going to provide music-video bits. You can tune in and tune out. But if 
you do that, you lose your viewership base, and advertisers aren't too happy 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
 MTV's major divergence from music-video programming began in 1987 with the 
dance show "Club MTV," the news program "Week in Rock" and "Remote Control," a 
game show testing college students' knowledge of music and TV trivia. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first stepped into this world of programming with video or music or 
pop culture references, we did it with the interest of shaking up the format, 
keeping it interesting, giving people something to talk about and write about," 
McGrath said. "Music is about a lot of different topics -- fashion, love, 
money, sex -- why not make some programming that reflects contemporary culture 
the way music does?" 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers suddenly began taking interest because they could selectively 
place commercials in specific programs, rather than take their chances in a 
block of music videos. "Not all advertisers are comfortable being in a 
music-video environment," Gruen said. "As we all know, the content for some of 
the music videos has more sex and violence than other types of television, and 
portrays situations that some advertisers and viewers don't feel comfortable 
with and don't want to be seen in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MTV executives say all their alternative programming serves one purpose: to 
encourage viewers to stick around and watch music videos. "Music videos are our 
bread and butter," McGrath said. She vows that they will never dip below 80% of 
the channel's total programming. "The viewers come to us for music," McGrath 
said. "I want to keep their faith. When they come there will be a video in a 
short time." 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage to producing its own shows is that MTV can establish a 
greater presence outside the cable-TV universe. Its shows feed into a marketing 
whirlwind that sweeps in wider audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV Productions, for example, is developing feature films based on "Beavis and 
Butt-head" and "Joe's Apartment," a short filler from MTV's promo department 
about a guy whose pad is infested with friendly cockroaches. And MTV has become 
a prominent launching pad for non-music personalities. Comic Denis Leary's 
ranting-and-raving MTV promos led to a comedy album and a budding feature film 
career. "MTV Sports" host Dan Cortese turned his gig into two starring roles in 
broadcast network series. Tabitha Soren is an NBC News correspondent 
specializing in pop culture. And MTV's production unit will continue to produce 
"Jon Stewart" for Paramount Television, which was recently bought by Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, MTV is like the 0 to 60 network," Davola said. "You get on, you 
get high visibility, you get high recognition." And when those personalities go 
on to bigger things, that notoriety rubs off on MTV. Pauly Shore still hosts 
programs on MTV at the same time he's starring in such movies for the Walt 
Disney Co. as "Son in Law" and the upcoming "In the Army Now." 
</P>
<P>
 "MTV is about new talent and the next thing , whatever that thing may be," 
McGrath said. "We're kind of like a farm team for new ideas."  
</P>
<P>
 So what's in the farm system right now? Following up on the runaway success of 
"Beavis and Butt-head" on MTV will be the August premiere of "The Brothers 
Grunt," created by Danny Antonucci ("Lupo the Butcher"), about a clan of 
brothers who leave their monastery to search for their runaway brother. This 
fall will bring the premiere of two more cartoons: "The Head," featuring the 
symbiotic relationship between a man and the alien in his head, and Sam Keith's 
homeless superhero "Maxx." In addition, "Aeon Flux," the espionage character 
from "Liquid Television" who wears a black leather G-string and massacres 
hundreds with her ray gun, will get her own series next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV just ordered a series called "Sand Blaster," an elaborate sun-and-sand 
version of "American Gladiators." And comedian Anthony Clark and the hip-hop 
group TLC are among several artists working on their own short comedy films. 
"We're developing these shorts to be prototypes for a half-hour (sitcom)," 
Davola said. "We will put then in rotation this summer. If one hits, we'll put 
on a pilot, and if we like that, we'll create a series." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no control over when and where and how we get videos," McGrath said. 
"Sometimes you go through a real drought, when you're hoping for something new 
and interesting, or some big proven star the audience wants to see. So now we 
can rely on our own creative juices to create programming and not just wait for 
the next Pink Floyd record." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not my perception that there's a shortage of good music videos, but 
rather a shortage of time to air those videos," responded Susan Solomon, 
president and CEO of SW Networks, a joint venture between Sony Software and 
Warner Music Group to produce, create and distribute music programming to 
everything from digital cable radio to computer on-line services. "It's much 
less expensive to help people produce better music videos than to engage in 
much more expensive long-form production. That strikes me as a little odd." 
</P>
<P>
 The record companies are not the only ones that believe MTV is vulnerable to 
healthy competition. In anticipation of a 500-channel cable universe, the 
marketplace for music videos is suddenly spinning at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, the country's sixth-largest cable operator, Cablevision Systems, 
will begin feeding the Canadian music video network MuchMusic to its 3 million 
subscribers. Black Entertainment Television is planning a separate jazz network 
in October. The easy-listening MOR Music TV, now available in 10 million homes, 
is launching a second music video channel with home shopping. Videos are also 
prime fodder on the Nashville Network, Country Music Television and the 
viewer-request channel, the Box. And there are 250 regional music video shows 
running on local cable channels and VHF stations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But a tough regulatory environment, with strict cable rate rollbacks recently 
issued by the Federal Communications Commission, is holding major new efforts 
at bay for now. Just last week, the owner of RCA Records and 
Tele-Communications Inc., the country's biggest cable operator, cited "changing 
market conditions" as the reason for scrapping a music-video network they had 
scheduled for launch later this year. Even the record companies seem stalled in 
their designs until they find another cable partner -- although they are now in 
discussions with TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no real distinct game plan," said a source close to the proceedings. 
"It's more like, 'Hey, we're going to do this. Let's put together a game plan.' 
But nothing has happened since then. It was announced for the end of the year, 
but I'll be shocked if it happens by then." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the next major music video channel to rival MTV's influence in 59 
million cable homes may come from . . . MTV. An aggressive game plan is afoot 
at the parent MTV Networks, one that involves global expansion and a dramatic 
renaissance of MTV's sister station, VH-1. Up until now, MTV has treated VH-1 
something like what Beavis might call a red-headed stepchild. VH-1 began as 
Video Hits One in 1985, four years after MTV, and loosely targeted baby 
boomers, first with Lionel Richie and Rod Stewart videos and later with reruns 
of "WKRP in Cincinnati." 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, VH-1 plans to lop off the baby boomer generation -- 
they're too old now -- to "create a greater music programming synergy" between 
MTV and VH-1. Current and breaking music videos will spill over from MTV onto 
VH-1 in a cross-promotional strategy to let viewers know that both channels are 
out there, working hand in hand to deliver a barrage of music. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, executives hope to synchronize programming to the point that, at 
any time of the day, either MTV or VH-1 will be playing music videos, and 
viewers will never for an instant be denied their MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely feel like there's growth potential for VH-1 that has not been 
optimized," said Andy Schuon, the former program director who helped KROQ-FM in 
Los Angeles become an instrumental force in shaping the alternative rock world. 
He was recently named senior vice president of music programming and program 
planning to spearhead the musical unification of MTV and VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Specifically, we have decided to make a concerted effort to properly 
synchronize the two channels better, to make them work together better," Schuon 
said. "If we're going to stay true to our core, we can't grow with our 
consumers like some products do. We'd like to hand off our MTV viewers at some 
point to VH-1." 
</P>
<P>
 MTV Networks does have eventual designs to spin off several new channels 
featuring different music genres -- a plan announced years ago -- and to get 
into merchandising everything from clothes to CDs. But until the cable universe 
opens up to new ventures, MTV Networks seems to be exploiting the assets it 
has. At a time when new channels are being frozen out, VH-1 has a solid 48.4 
million subscribers, or 83% of the country's cable television homes. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV currently targets viewers 12 to 34, and beginning later this year, VH-1 
will reach out to viewers 25 to 44, who are moving out of that younger age 
range but grew up on MTV. The MTV moniker has become a successful trademark and 
the envy of the TV industry, helping MTV achieve a global reach in 248 million 
homes in 58 countries. VH-1 hopes to develop its own distinct personality and 
point of view, while providing programming to meet its audience's needs.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to focus specifically on the universe of people MTV carved out," 
Schuon said. "The group of people who are familiar with music videos, who like 
music videos, who still use music to shape and define their lives, who need 
more music information and who want to know what's going on in pop culture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, MTV helped create the monstrous music industry that seems to have 
risen up against it. A few years ago, album sales were in the dumps. 
Alternative rock received no air time on mainstream radio until Nirvana 
exploded on MTV, swinging the direction of modern music, and "Yo! MTV Raps," a 
daily block of rap videos, led a rap revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The now thriving music industry has resulted in more albums from a wider 
variety of new artists who are making a torrent of music videos. MTV receives 
30 to 50 videos a week from the record labels -- produced at costs ranging from 
$25,000 for low-budget productions to $150,000 or more for expensive ones -- 
but can't make room for more than 10 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one constituency most forgotten about by MTV is the record company," said 
one music executive. "To a great degree, MTV is calling all the shots now. They 
have more people who want to be on MTV than they want to put on. In the old 
days, when MTV was starting out, the record industry called the shots. When you 
leave someone out of your tent and don't serve their need, they will find an 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath vehemently denies the scattered record industry comments that MTV has 
become a music video monopoly. "If we had that attitude we would be out of 
business," she said. "That is very offensive to me." 
</P>
<P>
 To expose new music, MTV has specifically created music video shows like 
"Alternative Nation" and "120 Minutes" for alternative music, "Headbangers 
Ball" for hard rock and "The Grind" for dance tunes. The other forms of 
programming MTV delves into usually showcase music, too -- from the steady 
tunes that score "The Real World" and "Dead at 21" to the campy music videos 
that Beavis and Butt-head provide a running commentary on ("This is cool," 
"This sucks"). 
</P>
<P>
 "We do try and do a good job to present (the record companies') music and 
create an environment for it," McGrath said. "We struggle every day to play the 
new videos they give us, and to find a place to play them." 
</P>
<P>
 The competition to get music videos played is exquisite. One music executive 
accused MTV of sequestering Schuon from people at the labels, who are always 
calling and pleading their cases to play new videos and break new groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schuon said he feels the pressure, even though he has a staff that sits 
down and talks with label representatives to hear their needs. "I get mail, 
faxes, phone calls. The pressure is intense," Schuon said. "When I was at KROQ, 
the pressure was there, but the truth is we were an alternative radio station, 
and more times than not the supply met the demand. At MTV, on the other hand, 
we choose to play music from rock to Top 40, from alternative to progressive, 
from hip-hop to rap. We define our channel as a musically diverse one. 
</P>
<P>
 "By doing that, there's always more supply, and I mean good supply, than we 
can play. We can't make the hour any longer. We can squeeze in about 10 videos 
an hour on television, and that's about it. If you're not going to limit your 
audience (to one genre), you're going to be faced with a space problem. So you 
pick the best of what you can, and no one is going to be happy all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 MTV takes credit for breaking such successful artists as Arrested Development, 
Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Counting Crows and Snoop Doggy Dogg. MTV 
devised "Buzz Bin," a graphic slapped on fringe music videos, to help gain some 
attention for them. "We absolutely jump on new music with diversity you won't 
find anywhere, and more quickly than we ever have," McGrath said. "Whether it's 
Pantera, Soundgarden, the Brand New Heavies, whoever it is -- people saw them 
first on MTV before they heard them on the radio or could buy them in the 
record store." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, MTV has followed rather than led in the breaking of acts," said 
a creative development executive at one of the record companies. "They like to 
see themselves as a powerful force in exposing new music, and they are. On the 
other side of things, they don't play something until they're pretty darned 
convinced it's going to be a hit and they won't be hung out to dry." 
</P>
<P>
 Record labels are now cozying up to dozens of alternative music-video outlets 
springing up around the country. "Record labels love us, because MTV doesn't 
program much M anymore," said Paul Carchidi, the creator of "Rage." Carchidi, 
an entertainment attorney, pays $1,750 for an hour of time every Friday night 
on Boston superstation WSBK-TV38, and then he sells his own advertising. Two 
weeks ago, his show clobbered MTV in the local ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rage" has done live interviews with k.d. lang and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, 
and has helped break such bands as Sweden's Whale, whose song "Hobo Humpin' 
Slobo Babe" received a flurry of national radio and MTV airplay after it was 
introduced on "Rage." Columbia Records credits "Rage" with the worldwide video 
premiere of the Chicago group Stabbing Westward -- leading to consumer demand 
and the opening spot for the current Depeche Mode tour -- six weeks before MTV 
played the group's video "Normal" on "120 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 "MTV has dropped the ball in terms of music," Carchidi said. "They used to 
educate people about new music and break bands. They don't care anymore. 
They're looking for the ratings point." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The record companies, according to sources, have discussed a hefty 
$100-million business plan to launch their new channel. "They're doing it for 
the same reason you find entertainment companies owning TV channels, or movie 
companies owning theater chains," explained Jeffrey Logsdon, an entertainment 
analyst for Seidler Amdec Securities. "You have a greater control over your 
distribution destiny. You can help create demand by playing what you believe 
are popular music videos, and that will help spur CD or cassette sales." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the record companies, they basically had real good years and 
the real question is: How do you maintain and increase the retail pie, and 
continue to further the interest in music?" said Solomon with SW Networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those kind of attitudes could lead to problems, observed Deborah Russell, 
music video editor for Billboard magazine: "I'm mystified how they will program 
the channel, when you have different labels competing for time. Who gets the 
heavy rotation? It would seem they would be better off each doing their own 
channel." 
</P>
<P>
 MTV's Schuon said that if the record companies succeed in getting their 
channel off the ground, they will eventually face the same "choose or lose" 
dilemma MTV did. "The truth is, if record companies feel disappointed in what 
they are getting on MTV and want to start their own channel, they're going to 
have to put on the best music possible to make it a successful business," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to be true to the core of their audience and not just use 
their channel as a marketing tool, they're going to have to consider playing 
artists that aren't their own, and artists who audiences wants to watch on TV 
-- whether or not it's their personal priority. That's where compromise comes 
in. That's what you can't lose track of -- the audience."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; GARFIELD STUDENTS WIN VIDEO CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Garfield High School students have won a national competition for their video 
illustrating how personal choices play a part in gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The six students, enrolled in teacher Jeff Combe's video production class, 
were treated to a four-day trip to New York for their piece "Stop Me Before . . 
." The contest was sponsored by Matsushita Electric Corporation of America and 
the Panasonic Kid Witness News Program.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first time I had been in a plane," said student Denise Espinoza, 
18, who was co-director. 
</P>
<P>
 The story, adapted from a play written and produced by a student last year, 
shows how difficult it is for a student to free himself from his past gang 
affiliation. The boy, who wants to attend a summer school class, has trouble 
because former rival gang members attend the same school.  
</P>
<P>
 The boy ends up buying a gun for protection and a friend finds out about it 
but does not tell anyone. The video ends when the rivals find the boy waiting 
at the front of the school and shoot him dead. The video explores not only his 
decision to buy the gun, but his friend's choice not to report it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the story from the friend that, 'If only I had told someone, this 
might not have happened,' " said Asst. Principal Carole Stoner, who took the 
trip with the students. "So often it's 'society' that (is blamed for creating) 
the problems with drugs or gangs, but not very often do you get something from 
the personal responsibility angle."  
</P>
<P>
 The class, which also included students Aileen Becerra, Raymundo Acosta, 
Douglas Avila, Michael Castillo and Jose Sandoval, won a top award last year in 
a school district competition for a production on condom use.  
</P>
<P>
 Garfield's video was chosen from about 300 entries from 200 schools throughout 
the country. Judges included NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw and film director 
Spike Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their prize, they visited museums in the New York area, Ellis 
Island, had lunch near the Statue of Liberty and went to the top of the Empire 
State Building. They were also treated to an awards ceremony and mentorship 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 For Denise, who will graduate June 29, the award has given her the incentive 
to continue pursuing her dream to become a film director. Others in the class 
also want careers in film. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awesome," she said. "It gives me more initiative to see that I can do 
a lot in my future." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; CONSERVATION PROJECT YIELDS 
SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mothers of East Los Angeles, Santa Isabel chapter, awarded $17,000 in 
scholarships to high school and college students Friday at Santa Isabel 
Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty students received the awards, ranging from $300 to $1,000 -- money 
generated from the mothers' participation in a water conservation project of 
the Department of Water and Power and the Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarships were awarded based on community service and financial need. 
</P>
<P>
 In its second year, the water conservation project trades in old toilets for 
low-flush toilets and receives $25 for every old toilet turned in for recycling 
into street asphalt, said board member Beatriz G. Mojarro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mothers used some of the money to hire seven high school students last 
summer to paint over graffiti on businesses and homes in Boyle Heights. They 
plan to hire more students this summer for graffiti and street cleanup, Mojarro 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the scholarship recipients are seniors going into college or community 
college and most come from Catholic high schools in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most of the scholarship recipients were from parochial schools, 
Mojarro said, the group hopes to recruit students from Garfield and Roosevelt 
high schools for the summer job program, which pays above minimum wage.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; EXPANDED CLINIC OPENS IN NEW AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling it a chance to offer enhanced health care to an underserved community, 
local activists and elected officials last week hailed the reopening of the 
Clinica Msgr. Oscar A. Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hospitals in this area can't give the same care to people as this 
clinic," said Councilman Mike Hernandez. "And the immigrant community doesn't 
feel comfortable going to those hospitals, that's why this clinic is so 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, which has moved to 1135 W. 6th St., provides free basic medical 
care to the Pico-Union and Westlake areas. The clinic was previously on Olympic 
Boulevard, at the west end of Pico-Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care services for the Latino community, especially the immigrant 
community, have been narrowed down," said Juan Carlos Ruiz, a pediatrician who 
heads the clinic's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The new location will allow the clinic to treat more patients, with the 
addition of three examining rooms, Ruiz said. More than 10,000 patients visit 
the clinic annually, and an estimated 40% are children. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 St. Vincent Medical Center wants to encourage youths who are adroit with their 
feet to develop green thumbs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Hercules, the medical center's community liaison, is expanding St. 
Vincent's youth intervention program intended to keep young people out of 
trouble by offering them a variety of activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is a popular drawing card, so Hercules decided to use St. Vincent's 
youth team to generate interest in the center's community garden: Youths who 
work in the garden may also join the soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main emphasis is to keep kids off the streets," Hercules said. "Working 
in the garden and growing vegetables for their parents will give them a sense 
of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The block-long garden at the corner of Grandview and 3rd streets has room for 
at least 18 plots, Hercules said. Supervision is provided Tuesdays and 
Thursdays from 5 to 7 p.m. and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to noon.  
</P>
<P>
 Ether Haley, a nurse at St. Vincent who has worked in the garden for four 
years, said she is happy to teach beginners how to grow corn, green beans, 
tomatoes, peppers and flowers, but she wants gardeners with a serious attitude. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard work and you have to make a commitment," Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hercules said youths ages 12 to 18 are eligible for the soccer team and 
gardening opportunities. Senior citizens are also welcome to work in the 
garden, he said.

<P>
 For proponents of community-based policing, office space donated by the 
Hospital of the Good Samaritan to the Los Angeles Police Department is just 
what the doctor ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers from Rampart and other divisions will be able to use the space 
at 1254 W. 6th St. as a drop-in center to take crime reports, make phone calls 
and meet with residents and merchants without having to return to their station 
house. The center, in the Weingart Guest House on the hospital's grounds, 
opened last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city attorney's office has charged a South-Central couple who own a 
residential hotel with 31 counts of health, building and safety code 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold W. Dickens, 61, and his wife, Isabelle R. Dickens, 60, were charged 
after a three-month investigation of the 20-unit building they own at 1241 
Martin Luther King Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Slum Housing Task Force found serious fire hazards, including 
defective smoke detectors and faulty fire doors; rodent infestation, and broken 
windows and doors, prosecutor Lawrence Punter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickens said he has contacted the city attorney's office to negotiate a 
settlement, but said he has not received a response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the structural problems were caused by the earthquake," Dickens said. 
"Some of the violations we haven't had a chance to take care of because we were 
dealing with problems of the earthquake. And we are right on the alley and it's 
a bad alley." 
</P>
<P>
 Punter said: "We understand the earthquake may have done some damage, but the 
conditions we are asking Mr. Dickens to correct are not earthquake-related, 
such as the roach infestation." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; 2 LOCAL DEVELOPERS ARE PROJECT FINALISTS 
</P>

<P>
 Two Los Angeles-based teams are among three finalists named to design and 
build a $15-million development expected to be the largest single private 
investment along Vermont Avenue in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers are Vermont Slauson Economic Development Corp. and the Barker 
Pacific Group. They are competing with Caleb Development and related companies, 
a partnership that includes the architects Solomon Inc. of San Francisco, to 
develop a mixed-use project on a 75,000-square-foot parcel at 81st Street and 
Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The finalists were announced Thursday after a panel of six judges, including 
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas and John Outterbridge, the former director of the 
Watts Towers Art Center, narrowed the field from among 66 proposals after a 
nationwide search. 
</P>
<P>
 Community input and the need to have local companies take part in the project 
were among the priorities used by the panel in selecting the finalists, said 
Naomi Nightingale, one of the judges and a Vermont Knolls resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The development, which would include a mixture of low-income housing and 
commercial-use spaces, has sparked debate among residents of the largely 
middle-class Vermont Knolls neighborhood, some of whom argue that the project 
should be dedicated to the businesses needed to revitalize the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the project say that critics have not presented an 
alternative. They point out that the development plans will include a 
commercial component. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no competing alternative that is a viable project that anyone has 
been able to produce," Ridley-Thomas said. "The only other commercial-use 
proposal has been a swap meet, and that is totally unacceptable to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the project, including Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) have 
said more low-income housing will not offer the economic stimulus needed to 
revitalize the depressed corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate Bank officials, who are backing the project, said they remain 
confident that the project will go forward despite opposition from Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sensitive to this issue and we know there's a need to discuss and 
debate this in the community," said Bruce Willison, chairman of First 
Interstate. "There is ample evidence of support for this mixed-use project, and 
we feel very confident that a situation of commercial use only would not be 
appropriate for the site." 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the project has yet to be finalized -- including the type of 
businesses that would be housed at the site -- proponents have promised that 
residents will have a say in the final plan.  
</P>
<P>
 A series of community meetings seeking input from residents is scheduled to 
begin June 22. The winning developer is expected to be announced by November, 
and groundbreaking could begin by early next year. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; TOUGH MEDICINE; COUNTY-USC MEDICAL CENTER IS GROWING TO 
MEET THE NEEDS OF THE POOR, BUT THERE IS A COST: A BROKEN NEIGHBORHOOD, 
UPROOTED FAMILIES 
</P>

<P>
 Al Juarez, 52, cruises through the streets of Marengo Terrace, but the 
neighborhood he sees is one that is no longer there. 
</P>
<P>
 Marengo Heights Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Camillus Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 And Brittania Street, which used to run north from Marengo Street and lined 
with homes up the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The memories are there, but much of Juarez's neighborhood is long gone, eroded 
bit by bit as County-USC Medical Center has grown to meet the needs of the 
county's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 An outpatient clinic stands where the homes on Brittania Street once stood. 
The USC University Hospital has replaced the church. The Francisco Bravo 
Medical Magnet High School is where Marengo Heights Elementary School used to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, Juarez, his family and more than 200 other households 
and businesses on Cummings, Chicago, Charlotte and Marengo streets -- and 
possibly Cornwell Street -- will witness the final transformation of their 
neighborhood. All will be demolished to make way for a single, streamlined 
2.1-million-square-foot county hospital to replace four of the medical center's 
hospitals, including outdated General Hospital and two outpatient clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The new six- to 15-story hospital is expected to save the county $49 million a 
year in operational costs, with improved -- but less costly -- security, the 
consolidation of some services and elimination of others. The $1.1-billion 
construction project is expected to be completed in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the replacement of the 40- to 60-year-old hospitals, federal and state 
regulators, citing safety reasons, have threatened to close the medical center, 
a place of last resort for millions of the county's uninsured and poor. Half of 
County-USC's patients are covered by Medi-Cal and an additional 32% have no 
insurance coverage whatsoever, according to 1993 figures. With 80,000 
admissions a year, 75% of which are emergencies, it is the busiest hospital in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to uproot several hundred residents to build a state-of-the-art 
hospital, County Supervisor Gloria Molina said, was seen as plausible when the 
"greater good" of providing medical care for the county's poor was considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Moreno and his wife, Maria Lourdes, and their two children have lived 
in the area for 11 years, the last four in the home they rent on Charlotte 
Street. Although they love their neighborhood with its nearby park and quiet 
streets, they said they understand the importance of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not good to have to move," said Moreno, 37, a supervisor at a North 
Hollywood manufacturing company, "but if it's good for the community, then it's 
worth the sacrifice we have to make." 
</P>
<P>
 But Juarez, who was born at General Hospital and works with a federal jobs 
training program, sees it differently. His family, which moved to Cummings 
Street in 1950, has fought all along the way to preserve as much of their 
neighborhood as they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minority communities are divested of their right to live in the city," he 
said. "Their rights are sacrificed in the process of doing something for the 
'greater good' of the community. When you start busting up a neighborhood, a 
lot of things start happening . . . graffiti, cars broken into, absentee 
landlords." 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez's 72-year-old mother, Amparo, has seen tremendous changes over the 
years in Marengo Terrace and has raised five children in the process. Her son, 
Manuel, worked as a volunteer at County-USC's trauma center when he was a 
teen-ager and is now a doctor at Loma Linda Hospital. Six people spanning three 
generations now live in the house and a duplex on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real neighborhood," she said as she sat in a recliner in the family 
den. "We had a shoe shop and a bank and we had houses all along Marengo. Little 
by little, things just started falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, the Juarez family and their neighbors have fought plans to 
change Marengo Terrace and met with some success. When the county hospital 
wanted to build a wall at the edge of their properties about 28 years ago, they 
defeated it. And about 35 years ago they were able to save Hazard Park when 
officials planned to build a veterans hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just banded together and brought in the news and television. We raised a 
lot of protest," Amparo Juarez said.  
</P>
<P>
 But County-USC appears to have won this battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to begin county appraisals of properties by July 1, setting the 
stage for negotiations and buyouts, relocation and demolition. Construction of 
an eight-story parking structure south of Marengo Street will be the 
groundbreaking project. The houses and businesses on Cummings Street will be 
the first to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has promised assistance to those who will be displaced, up to 
$22,500 for homeowners, in addition to their property's fair market value, and 
a flat payment of 48 months of rental payments for those who have leased 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of moving has been difficult for many, particularly the elderly. 
And it has been especially painful to those who moved here after being 
displaced by other construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked for nine months before I settled on this house," said Lorenzo 
Canales, who moved to Cummings Street in 1953 after being forced out of Chavez 
Ravine to make way for the construction of Dodger Stadium. His lot and three 
homes now hold four generations of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Troncoso grew up on Cummings Street, was married in St. Camillus Church 
and bought a house up the street from her mother, Francisca Flores. She now 
fears that the family will not be able to find homes as close as they are now. 
"It's very strange seeing the changes," Troncoso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Moreno and other renters say the county's offer will give them an 
opportunity to buy their first home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help us with a down payment for a house," he said. "Otherwise, we 
would not be able to come up with the down payment," 
</P>
<P>
 Feelings are just as mixed in the business community, where the county has 
promised fair market value and relocation help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's not fair, but what am I going to do?" asked Jenny Shin, who 
has owned the Burger King at Cummings and Marengo streets for nine years. The 
restaurant will be razed to make way for the widening of Marengo and the 
entrance to the new hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying my best to take care of the business," said Shin, who wants to 
relocate nearby to keep the customers she has served over the years. "I'm the 
only one that's a property owner; the other (business people) are renters," she 
said. "They're happy because business is bad and they're going to be bought out 
by the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Lowe, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles who has 
been helping Marengo Terrace residents through the county process, said 
developers and government agencies have to think hard again before cutting into 
a neighborhood. After Chavez Ravine, freeway projects and now the replacement 
of County-USC Medical Center, displacing neighborhoods has become such an 
expensive proposition -- $35 million in this case -- that it will not be so 
easy in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communities cannot be sacrificed in the name of progress," Lowe said. "We 
have to believe in preserving the Eastside communities and other communities 
all throughout the inner city and let (government officials) know how expensive 
it's going to be. We have to drive that home with the politicians, who when 
they think of 200 families, 'it's no big deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Architect William Roger of Romigh Roger Rusk, a Los Angeles architectural firm 
that designed the new hospital, said he and other planners studied several 
alternatives to displacing the neighborhood, but the prohibitive cost of 
demolishing General Hospital and the disruption it would cause to patient care 
forced the county's decision to go into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the new hospital to be placed at Marengo and Cummings streets, 
where the outpatient and AIDS clinics and a parking structure now stand. A 
flat, handicapped-accessible parking lot for 400 vehicles will be built at the 
site of the 15-acre Marengo Terrace neighborhood, as well as entrances for 
outpatient, inpatient and emergency services, and an education and conference 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were planning to build the hospital without having to go into the 
neighborhood until we realized the (1992 Americans With Disabilities Act) 
required this lot," said Frank Villalobos, president of Barrio Planners Inc., 
an Eastside architectural firm and consultant on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The new hospital will have far fewer public entrances -- only four to six -- 
and an improved security system complete with door metal detectors, thereby 
reducing the medical center's $10-million annual security budget by an 
undetermined amount. General Hospital alone has 33 entrances, where ambulances, 
supplies, family members and outpatients arrive. After a gunman shot and 
wounded three doctors last year in the emergency room, a private security 
company was hired, and visitors are routinely screened for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 General Hospital was completed in 1932, before safety codes required fire 
sprinklers and outside exits. Stairwells, which would be used in an evacuation, 
empty into the building instead. And because it does not meet fire codes, the 
hospital must spend $2.3 million annually on a fire watch team whose members go 
on rounds to check for fire and safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 General Hospital was designed with five-bed wards and no private rooms or 
waiting rooms. Wires are strewn across each ward to hold up curtains for 
patient privacy. Fans for ventilation can be found hooked up by extension cords 
in hallways and rooms because there is no air conditioning. Oxygen tanks sit in 
corridors because the facility has no piped-in oxygen. In some departments, 
doctors and nurses examine X-rays on viewing screens in the hallways because 
there is nowhere else to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees say the new building will not only be a plus for them, but will also 
increase patients' comfort and improve care. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxane Raffin Chan, a clinical nurse manager in pulmonary, bronchoscopy and 
rheumatology, described time-wasting and ex-hausting measures to track down 
patients at various clinics on the 72-acre campus. And, she said, patients are 
forced to endure inconveniences while not in the best of health. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we have to run around from building to building to building, but the 
patients are on stretchers and they're having to go from building to building," 
Raffin Chan said. "We have to call county transport if they have to get tests 
done and they're sick. It would be wonderful to get all the tests done in one 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 General Hospital also is desperately lacking in privacy for patients and their 
families, which the new facility will seek to rectify by providing private and 
double rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Raffin Chan said, a dying woman in a ward with four other patients 
delivered a fetus in front of her family, who had no idea she was pregnant. The 
family's trauma became a public display in the ward -- and the other patients 
had to share the experience with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "A curtain doesn't cut it," Raffin Chan said. "From what I see, we have the 
high-tech, state-of-the-art equipment, the knowledge and the caring. The only 
thing we don't have is an adequate place to put it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Hernandez, a former custodian who has roamed the corridors of General 
Hospital for the last two years as part of the fire watch team, has become 
familiar with the old building in ways he never imagined. He said he frequently 
has to move stretchers or oxygen tanks that could block access to firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure, back in the '30s, they never would have imagined that this place 
would grow the way it did," Hernandez said.  
</P>
<P>
 The new hospital will have 946 beds, fewer than the current 1,450, and this 
has raised concerns that it will actually provide fewer services to the 
community. But Edward L. Martinez, the medical center's executive director, 
defends the reduction in beds by pointing out that there will be a more 
efficient use of beds in the new hospital and that more illnesses and injuries 
will be handled on an outpatient basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concentration will be on high acuity (the most intensive), intense and 
high-tech services," he said. "A higher proportion will be (intensive-care 
unit) beds. Now, 8% to 9% are ICU. That will be 25% in the new facility. Our 
level of care will essentially remain the same. Those beds we will be 
eliminating will be contracted out to the community clinics, which handle 
low-acuity, low-maintenance beds." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the kind of role that County-USC plays, as far as its 
regional responsibilities to meet the health care needs of the poor, of those 
who have no other access to health care, it's very significant," said 
Supervisor Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 So crucial, she said, that displacing the families and business owners in 
Marengo Terrace has to be done. Otherwise, she said, the care delivered to the 
poor at the hospital would have stopped, an even greater disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no choice because the population of need is not going away," Molina 
said. "There is no other option for people who need health care in this 
community but to rebuild the facility and get it done as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 For Al Juarez, who was born at General Hospital, the sadness of moving from 
his childhood home is mixed with a feeling of helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an example of poor people being pushed out and the compensation 
isn't enough to replace your home. Raggedy as it is, a lot of people think 
(this neighborhood) is home."

 In retrospect, Clayton County Medical Examiner Joe Burton says now, they 
should have recognized the first call from Southern Regional Medical Center as 
a red flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals, after all, normally don't contact the medical examiner when a 
fragile, terminally ill 39-day-old baby dies. In neonatology units, medical 
staffs regularly walk fine lines, judging whether and when to give up on such 
doomed, premature infants, but theirs is a tortuous ethical exercise practiced 
largely in private, shared only with the infants' families. It is not the 
custom of medical staffs to invite county authorities to second-guess them. Yet 
that was precisely what nurses at Southern Regional appeared to be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 The first call, at 11:17 on Saturday morning, Oct. 16, went to Clayton County 
Coroner Abb Dickson. He relayed it to the forensic pathologists in Joe Burton's 
office. Whatever nurse Gwen Pierce told Burton's staffers, it didn't arouse 
their concerns. Under Georgia law, if a death can reasonably be explained by 
natural causes, it's not for the medical examiner. Investigator Don Wiegand 
declined jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital persisted, though. At 5:45 p.m. that same day, Nancy Goodrum, 
Southern Regional's vice president for patient services, called the coroner 
again. This time the hospital put the matter more explicitly. 
</P>
<P>
 Several nurses in the neonatal care unit, Goodrum reported, believed that Dr. 
Eva Carrizales, the attending neonatologist, had "hastened" a baby's death. The 
baby, who had never left the neo intensive-care unit, was undeniably terminal. 
But at least two nurses, and possibly a third, said they'd seen Carrizales 
"holding the baby's mouth shut."  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the medical examiner's office spotted the red flag.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether the report was true or not, he had to investigate this case, Burton 
realized. What did they have here?  
</P>
<P>
 What they had, Burton in time would reluctantly conclude, was a caring, 
compassionate doctor so affected by her patients' suffering that she'd crossed 
a forbidden line. What they had, Burton ruled on Nov. 4, was a homicide.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Homicide' is a term that medical examiners use in order to classify a 
death," an obviously troubled and ambivalent Burton cautioned in his written 
report. "It does not imply that there was 'murder.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Yes it does, a Clayton County grand jury decided six days later. Indicting 
Carrizales on a murder charge, the grand jurors concluded that the doctor "with 
malice aforethought did cause the death of Omar Jiminez . . . by asphyxia due 
to smothering and neck compression." 
</P>
<P>
 The murder indictment of Carrizales has fueled an anguished uproar in this 
suburban region south of Atlanta. The medical examiner has cried over his 
decision; the district attorney has prayed. Carrizales has resigned her medical 
posts, and doctors of all sorts have flinched, thinking of the difficult, 
ambiguous situations they face daily. Carrizales' supporters -- among them 
parents of her tiny patients, fellow church congregants, colleagues and 
neighbors -- have marched in rallies, organized fund-raising campaigns, called 
television stations, written letters to the editor. In statements to police 
detectives, communications through her lawyers and -- before turning silent -- 
interviews with journalists, Carrizales herself has insisted she didn't cause 
the baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Statements, medical nuances, hidden agendas -- all have been the subject of 
agitated speculation. So, too, have matters beyond the immediate particulars of 
Carrizales' case. How we let people die -- that's what this is all about, some 
of Carrizales' supporters eventually began to suggest. Isn't a dignified, 
peaceful death better than prolonged, gasping agony? 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the hospital chief who turned her in, the medical examiner who 
judged her and the prosecutor who charged her all sound as reluctant to punish 
Carrizales as do her supporters. But punish her they very well might, for her 
murder trial looms, and no one feels able to back down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a choice," says Robert Keller, the Clayton County district 
attorney. "I would seek another charge if the facts allowed. But the facts 
don't allow." 
</P>
<P>
 TWO HOURS AFTER OMAR JIMINEZ'S DEATH, THE PHONE RANG IN THE home of Southern 
Regional executive Nancy Goodrum. There's a problem here at the hospital, nurse 
Linda Emerson began. A problem with a baby's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby, born by emergency C-section at 27 weeks gestation, weighing under 
two pounds, had been severely ill with lung and kidney problems. For days, the 
baby had been judged pre-terminal. But he had kept hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the nurses who were there, Emerson said, sometime early that 
morning the doctor turned down the ventilator, then later -- apparently without 
the usual consultation with other doctors or explicit agreement of the family 
-- took the baby off the ventilator and all support lines. But the baby 
wouldn't stop breathing; for more than an hour, he kept gasping. 
</P>
<P>
 In that hour, the nurses believe they saw Carrizales put her hand over the 
baby's mouth and squeeze the carotid arteries in his neck. The doctor even told 
them what she was doing, the nurses claimed. She said she was shutting off the 
blood flow to the baby's brain. The nurses were very upset, Emerson said. 
They'd already placed a standard call to the coroner, reporting a child's 
death. But they thought more should be done. 
</P>
<P>
 After digesting this report, Goodrum left messages at the hospital's law firm, 
then drove to the hospital to review the baby's chart. By early afternoon, she 
and a hospital attorney were speaking on a conference call with Dr. Donald 
Lackey, the hospital's vice president for medical affairs. Lackey should call 
Carrizales, the lawyer advised, and point blank ask her three questions: Did 
she turn the ventilator down? Did she hold the baby's mouth closed? Did she cut 
off the blood flow through the baby's carotids? 
</P>
<P>
 It was a task Lackey approached with considerable dread. A doctor he knew and 
cared about might be in trouble, he realized. So might the hospital, and no 
hospital needs negative publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lackey hoped to hear a different perspective on this story from Carrizales -- 
an explanation and a denial. Lackey admired Carrizales. Because his own 
specialty was newborns, the two occasionally chatted over coffee about the 
state of the art in their field. The 41-year-old mother of four had been at 
Southern Regional three years, and he thought her a nice, sensitive person with 
a good reputation as a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Those more familiar with Carrizales held even stronger feelings of admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 She'd come out of Mission, Tex., with her high school sweetheart, Enrique, she 
a Mission High cheerleader, he the football team's wide receiver. Mexican 
Americans from poor families, they'd married young; she worked while he earned 
his architectural degree, then she, in 1982, earned her medical degree at what 
is now the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Ft. Worth. After 
completing a pediatric residency in Texas and, in 1990, a neonatology 
fellowship in Michigan, she'd joined a small practice that provided neonatal 
services to three Atlanta-area hospitals, including Southern Regional. She'd 
just taken her boards and was about to become certified. 
</P>
<P>
 Their two older daughters were attending the University of Texas, and their 
two younger children were still at home. Religious faith formed a central 
pillar of the Carrizales family's life. Every Sunday morning, between the 
regular services at North Fayette United Methodist Church, Eva and her husband 
attended a church discussion group on how to apply their faith to daily life. 
"I have to pray every hour to be good," she'd tell other church members. "If I 
can't hold on to God, I'd lose it." 
</P>
<P>
 She was, by most accounts, a compassionate doctor who loved babies. 
Appreciative mothers would call her at home, and later, when their babies had 
grown, drop by to show off how they were doing. Carrizales kept photos of her 
patients and their families on her refrigerator door. In fact, on the Saturday 
afternoon when Lackey called her, one of those photos pictured Omar Jiminez's 
family -- Omar Jiminez, who'd died in her arms just hours before. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers had told Lackey he needed to hurry, to get an answer quickly, so 
he steeled himself. "I need to ask you some questions," he began. "I need to 
get some answers, then I need to get off the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 To his hospital colleagues, to the police in oral statements and a signed 
letter, to the grand jury and to a journalist, Lackey's account of what 
followed has not varied. Carrizales, he says, "basically affirmed all three 
points." Yes, she had turned down the ventilator. Yes, she had held the baby's 
mouth closed, out of sensitivity to the parents because his features were so 
distorted by gross swelling. Yes, she had placed her hand on the baby's neck to 
limit the blood supply to the brain.  
</P>
<P>
 Listening to her, Lackey's heart sank. This was not what he'd wanted to hear. 
It seemed to him she didn't really understand the seriousness of the situation. 
He sensed she didn't see anything wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 24 hours, Lackey would call Carrizales back five times. He would 
advise her to get a lawyer, and he would refer her to one. He would also, at 
least as Carrizales recalls it, say, "You should have lied to me." 
</P>
<P>
 At this moment, though, Lackey had no time for advice or comfort. "I told her 
I had to get off the phone," he explained. "I said I would call her back." 
</P>
<P>
 As both doctor and administrator, Lackey felt torn in several directions. He 
had good reason. Decisions to take infants off respirators because they are 
basically dead, because their systems are shutting down, are made almost daily 
in neonatal units across the country. But if it is a common business, it is 
also a tricky business, the subject of continual debate within the medical 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology in recent years has enabled doctors to resuscitate ever smaller and 
more premature infants. As a result, it has also obliged doctors to withdraw 
treatment from a growing number of babies who eventually just can't survive. 
Here is where the doctors risk trouble, since the criteria for judging when to 
give up remain uncertain, varying widely from hospital to hospital, doctor to 
doctor. The type of statistical certainty needed for more uniform guidelines 
just isn't attainable. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors, in other words, are always facing hard choices and the prospect 
of censure. More than a few neonatologists, discussing decisions they've made, 
privately say that beyond lawsuits, they fear losing their licenses -- and even 
more. "What we constantly fear is being charged with murder," one says.  
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, the notion of handing Eva Carrizales to the legal 
authorities felt chilling indeed to Lackey. At the same time, though, Lackey 
understood why three nurses had come in tears to their supervisors. What they'd 
seen was not in synch with the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Regional has procedures to follow before withdrawing support. You 
don't just take babies off ventilators and heart monitors on your own; you 
consult with two other doctors, who must see the patient and sign off. You also 
consult with the parents and document some sort of agreement, be it oral or 
written. Carrizales was insisting the prognosis and treatment had been 
explained to these parents, but at best this point remained unclear, for the 
parents, from Guadalajara, Mexico, were young, uneducated, bewildered, 
frightened. The mother had no immigration papers and neither spoke English.  
</P>
<P>
 Hospital procedures aside, it appeared, at least from the nurses' statements, 
that Carrizales might have actively intervened to hasten a death. Doctors don't 
knowingly do that -- especially in front of other people, especially in a 
hospital neonatal intensive-care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lackey wondered -- had stress caught up with Carrizales? He imagined her 
frustration over seeing another baby struggling slowly toward an inevitable 
death. The baby wasn't ready to have physiology take over, the parents were 
present, and she lost it. Eva Carrizales was sensitive, caring, nice -- what 
else could it be? In the end, he didn't know what she was thinking. He only 
knew -- or thought he knew -- what she did. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of conference calls that Saturday afternoon, the hospital 
administrators and lawyers considered their options. They could not, they soon 
decided, keep this to themselves. In 1989, they'd tried just that, to a 
disastrous end. A man who'd come into the emergency room, a stabbing victim, 
had died in surgery. The hospital administrator had actually hung up on 
reporters raising quality-of-care issues, generating a lot of bad publicity.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the doctors wouldn't like it; many would prefer review by peers rather 
than by cops and lawyers. But Lackey felt Nancy Goodrum had to call the coroner 
back. "Peer review wouldn't come for days after," Lackey explained later. "What 
were we going to do with the baby? Just hold it until then? Once Dr. Carrizales 
says yes, she did it, then we're legally obligated to call the authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Lackey expected, many doctors at Southern Regional vigorously 
objected. The nurses were confused, they argued, the nurses misunderstood the 
situation. "Where was due process, where was peer review?" demanded one doctor, 
pounding the table at a staff meeting the following week.  
</P>
<P>
 Two days after Goodrum contacted the coroner and medical examiner, Carrizales' 
colleagues in fact did conduct a peer review. Focusing on the medical rather 
than legal dimension of Carrizales' actions, they concluded that the care of 
this baby had not been "below standards."  
</P>
<P>
 By then, however, it no longer mattered what a hospital peer review board 
thought about Eva Carrizales' conduct. By then, Clayton County police 
detectives had spent the weekend at Southern Regional combing through files and 
interviewing nurses. By then, the death of a frail baby in a neonatal unit was 
a matter to be judged not in the medical community, but in a court of law -- 
and in the court of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy of baby Jiminez conducted a day after his death revealed just how 
ill the infant had been in his last hours. Among other ailments, he suffered 
from masses of inflamed and infected tissue in the brain, severe and late-stage 
broncho-pulmonary abnormalities, extensive fungal infection of the kidneys, 
liver congestion and spleen congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 What the autopsy did not reveal was any physical evidence of suffocation. 
There were no bruises on the neck or other proof that Carrizales had smothered 
the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 So Joe Burton, a 49-year-old forensic pathologist who provides 
medical-examiner services to five counties in the greater Atlanta area, turned 
to what evidence he did have. For days, he studied the police reports, medical 
reports and statements provided to investigators at the hospital. Drawing 
mainly from the nurses' accounts, he pieced together something of a chronology. 
</P>
<P>
 The severely ill newborn, Burton saw, entered the Southern Regional neonatal 
intensive-care unit on Sept. 13. Within days, the baby developed a septic 
infection, then kidney problems. Doctors vainly tried to wean him off a 
respirator. At 1 month, his kidneys began failing, his heart rate soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Through interpreters, the parents, Guadalupe Jiminez, 22, and Jesus 
Covarubias, 24, were made aware of their baby's poor prognosis. Precisely what 
they were told, though, and how they responded, remained somewhat unclear. One 
early press report had the mother, through an interpreter, quoting the father 
as saying the baby's death was inevitable, and that if the doctor did end the 
baby's life, she was "doing them a favor." A later press report had the mother 
telling an interpreter she felt "the doctor did something wrong" and the father 
declaring "she's not God. . . . It's not good because no one can do God's job." 
</P>
<P>
 All Burton finally could rely on were the parents' statements to the police. 
Those statements indicated that neither parent knew "for sure" that the doctor 
was going to disconnect life support. No one, they said, directly discussed 
this with them, nor did they sign any documents. They did assume Carrizales 
knew what was best for their child, and they did know the baby was not expected 
to live. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 15, the baby's kidneys virtually stopped functioning. After midnight, 
his respiratory function began to deteriorate. By early morning, his blood 
gases showed high carbon dioxide and low oxygen levels. 
</P>
<P>
 It was "after the 4:30 a.m. time" on Oct. 16, Burton would later write, "that 
the complicated clinical scenario begins to develop with this infant." That was 
when nurse Maritza Vias began pumping 100% oxygen to the baby through a face 
mask and notified Carrizales about the poor blood-gas readings. By then, nurses 
were using suction to clean large amounts of thick, white secretions from the 
baby and the ventilator tube. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Vias' statement, when Carrizales entered the room minutes later, 
she ordered the nurse to stop the suctioning. Then, at 4:45 a.m., Carrizales 
ordered Versed, a narcotic sedative, be given intravenously. She also, 
according to Vias, turned down the ventilator pressure rate to a setting of 3.  
</P>
<P>
 Mulling over that ventilator setting and sedative, Burton couldn't help but 
wonder whether Carrizales had in fact precipitated this baby's decline. Some 
neonatologists, after all, would suggest that setting the ventilator to 3 and 
giving Versed was tantamount to saying, "You're on your own, but this won't 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's parents, Burton saw from the nurse's notes, were called to the 
hospital shortly before 5 a.m. At 5:15, the mother said she wanted to hold her 
baby. Carrizales responded by disconnecting the ventilator as well as the 
various lines that deliver nutrients and monitor blood gases, then handed the 
baby to his mother as nurses again gave him oxygen through a mask.  
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the baby's heart rate plummeted; the alarm rang on the heart 
monitor. According to the nurses' statements and notes, Carrizales turned off 
the monitor and ordered Epinephrine, a heart and nerve stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight to 10 minutes later, Carrizales took the baby from the mother and placed 
him in a radiant warmer as she directed the parents to the family room. For 
several minutes, she tried chest compressions. Then she stopped and told Vias 
to take away the oxygen mask. 
</P>
<P>
 Cradling the baby in her arms, Carrizales sat down in a wooden rocking chair 
in one corner of the neonatal intensive-care unit. The baby, according to the 
nurses, was gasping and still had an apparent heart rate. Carrizales rocked and 
cradled the baby, checking his heart rate every five or six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to two nurses, Carrizales during this time "was holding the baby's 
mouth closed." According to Vias, Carrizales at one point said she was glad she 
was on duty and not her partner, because he would have kept the baby on the 
ventilator until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:15, Carrizales gave the baby to Vias and went to talk to the parents. 
Detecting a breath and heart rate, Vias told Carrizales upon her return: "This 
baby is breathing." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrizales took the baby back and -- as Burton put it in his written report -- 
"is alleged to have said something to the effect, 'Don't let the baby breathe.' 
"  
</P>
<P>
 Breathe he did, though; the minutes stretched on. At 6:45, when nurse Rebekah 
Martin replaced Vias, they noted that Carrizales was still cradling and rocking 
the gasping baby as she sat in the rocking chair. They saw no ventilators, no 
oxygen tubes, no monitors, no invasive support lines. "He still has a faint 
heart sound," Carrizales murmured. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:15, nurses again took the baby to the parents; they or the doctor 
apparently believed him dead. As the parents were holding him in a private 
family room, the baby apparently moved and gasped. Rosaura Martens, a family 
friend and translator, came running to the nurses, yelling, "The baby's alive, 
it's a miracle." According to Martens, Carrizales responded by saying this was 
why she didn't want the parents to hold the baby -- "because they would think 
it would live."  
</P>
<P>
 According to nurse Martin, Carrizales took the baby back and once more began 
cradling and rocking him, saying she was "holding the baby in such a way as to 
cut off the blood flow to the brain so that this won't drag on. . . . The 
parents have been through enough, and this could last for days. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 This comment, Martin told the police, so horrified and distressed her, she 
changed the subject. She could not, she told the police, actually see where the 
doctor's hands were. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:50, a priest came to be with the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8, the baby was very "dusky," with only a minimal heart rate and an 
occasional gasp. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:10, he was still gasping occasionally, but had no audible heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:13, Carrizales pronounced Omar dead. She was at the end still cradling 
and rocking the tiny, doomed infant.  
</P>
<P>
 That, at least, was the sequence of events suggested by Burton's reading of 
the nurses' statements and notes. When Burton turned to Clayton County Police 
Detective Mark McGann's interview with Carrizales, he found an alternative 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 McGann had reached the hospital at 9:30 that first night, some 13 hours after 
the baby's death. First he'd heard a summary of the nurses' accounts from a 
hospital administrator. Then, nearing midnight, Carrizales had passed word to 
him: If you want to talk to me, let's do it now. She wanted to get home. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor's manner, McGann would later say, was flat and unemotional. She was 
direct, unguarded, sure of herself -- and, in a way, utterly unsophisticated. 
McGann had read her the Miranda rights, but near the end of a one-hour 
interview, sitting in the presence of three police officers, she'd still asked, 
"Is this a police matter?" 
</P>
<P>
 McGann had been surprised that she was willing to talk, that she had actually 
initiated the interview. Other doctors in this situation would have seen 
danger, he felt. Other doctors would have said -- whoa, need a lawyer. Instead, 
Carrizales had said, over and over: "This baby was terminal. . . . This baby 
was going to die."  
</P>
<P>
 In his written report, Burton later summarized Detective McGann's account of 
his interview with Carrizales: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Carrizales states that the infant was dying and she did not institute a 
no-code order because she felt the infant was going to die on its own and would 
not have to require a withdrawal of life support. . . . Dr. Carrizales states 
that she was holding the mouth closed in order to keep the family from seeing 
the distorted features, that the baby was markedly swollen, oozing fluids, and 
she was doing it out of sensitivity to the parents. Her notes do also reflect 
that she placed her hand over both sides of the neck. She states that she did 
this in order to see if the heart was pumping blood up the carotids. She states 
that she may have made some statement to the nurses about something like this 
procedure could cut off the flow of blood to the brain but she states that 
there really wasn't any flow to cut off at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Carrizales states further that many dying infants . . . have episodes in 
which their heart rate increases, decreases, and that they have spontaneous 
respiration and that this is primarily reflex and not consistent with the 
infant actually being alive. Such activity can go on for hours. She states that 
the heart rate that she was obtaining during the time she was rocking the 
infant was approximately five beats per minute and sometimes even slower. Dr. 
Carrizales admits that she did not follow hospital procedure in removing life 
support but states that this was the custom where she was trained in order to 
facilitate the sensitivity of a dying infant and his bonding with the family 
into the procedure more smoothly. Dr. Carrizales says that the infant had 
polycystic kidneys and was markedly bloated with fluid and had no chance to 
live." 
</P>
<P>
 What to make of all this? Burton wondered when he'd finished reviewing the 
file. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical examiner couldn't help but wonder whether any of the nurses held a 
grudge against Carrizales. There's a high stress level in neonatal units, after 
all, with lots of emotions, lots of decisions, lots of medical ups and downs.  
</P>
<P>
 There are also lots of cases like this one, Burton believed; he just didn't 
usually hear about them. Why this one?  
</P>
<P>
 One of the three nurses, according to the police report, had in fact 
complained about Carrizales once before. Nurse Terry Marin thought the doctor 
hadn't properly consulted others before disconnecting the respirator to a very 
premature, hours-old newborn. So perhaps there was some ill feeling between 
them. Still, the nurses seemed to Burton genuinely upset with what they'd seen. 
They were shocked, particularly by the doctor's comments. That's what set this 
case apart. We couldn't believe she was doing it, the nurses kept saying to 
McGann. We couldn't believe she was telling us she was doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton could see it both ways. Part of him sort of agreed with what he thought 
Carrizales had done. This baby, born 10 years ago, would not have lived at all. 
But part of him could not go along with it, especially the way she did it. Of 
course, it was not up to Burton to make value judgments. He had a role. His 
task was to determine how this baby died. 
</P>
<P>
 So he tried to look at the facts: This infant had multi-system organ problems, 
was septic, had kidney failure and significant pathology of the brain. It was 
almost certain that even with maintenance of life support, this infant would 
have died.  
</P>
<P>
 When, though? 
</P>
<P>
 Medical records and nurses' statements suggested that once the ventilator had 
been turned down and later disconnected, and once fluids had been discontinued, 
the infant deteriorated markedly from his already critical condition. Had these 
measures been continued, it was virtually certain the infant still would have 
died. But removing them accelerated the process. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the issue for him, Burton felt: whether or not the infant died on its 
own or whether the death was facilitated by another. Carrizales insisted that 
for all practical purposes the infant was dead, so anything she may have done 
in no way affected the outcome. Burton saw it differently. To him, an infant 
with gasping respirations and a detectable heart rate can't technically be 
declared dead, not unless you can show he had no brain waves.  
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious to Burton that Carrizales had shown humanitarian care, concern 
and love for this dying infant. Possibly it was because of her deep concern for 
the infant that she did her best to facilitate its death. Facilitate she had, 
though, Burton believed. To him, at least, the evidence clearly demonstrated 
that by holding the infant's mouth closed and pressing the carotids, she had 
hastened the end of cerebral activity, even if that activity had been merely 
reflexive. She had, in essence, entered into the physiological happenings that 
resulted in this infant's death.  
</P>
<P>
 On more than one night, Burton would later say, he lay awake over this case. 
He also conferred with the prosecutors, the police detectives, other doctors 
and half a dozen forensic investigators. One morning, when he and his 
colleagues staged their own mock grand jury, Burton was the only person who 
said he might not vote to indict her. But in the end, as he put it later, he 
decided "I had to speak for the truth." If he was going to do his job honestly, 
he couldn't back down. What would that mean for the next hard case? Where would 
it stop? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, his judgment was based almost entirely on witnesses, not on hard medical 
evidence, not on anything from the autopsy. But bottom line, he just could not 
misbelieve so many witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "A homicide means that an action of another individual contributed to or 
caused the death of another," he wrote in his report. "It does not imply that 
there was 'murder.' Murder is more of a legal term. I do not feel that we can 
classify this death as a natural death. . . . Had Dr. Carrizales not held the 
mouth shut, not held her hands in any way around the neck, and only had the 
infant off of life support, it is probable that death would have ensued, 
possibly within minutes of when it actually occurred. (But) I have no way of 
knowing for sure, nor does anyone else on this Earth have any way of knowing 
for sure exactly how long this infant may have continued to have gasping 
respirations and a slow or agonal (death agony) heartbeat. . . . In trying to 
be fair . . . I have no choice . . . other than to sign the case out as I have 
done. I have listed the cause of death as asphyxia, due to smothering and neck 
compression. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 In the days following Joe Burton's ruling, a small army of Carrizales' shocked 
supporters rose to her defense. A dozen parents called the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution within the first 24 hours alone to tell how she had saved 
their babies' lives. Others marched in demonstrations outside Southern 
Regional, wrote letters to the editor, phoned the television stations. Members 
of Carrizales' church organized a fund-raising campaign directed at the Georgia 
medical community.  
</P>
<P>
 A good number thought it important to document Carrizales' record as a heroic 
and compassionate doctor. "The first month of our grandson's life, we didn't 
think he would live," Judith Evans of Fayetteville wrote in a letter to the 
editor. "But Dr. Eva Carrizales gave him the same care and attention as the 
other babies. . . . When Thomas went home, Carrizales gave us her phone number 
and told us to call anytime we needed her. We need more doctors like Eva 
Carrizales."

<P>
 Others thought it relevant to ask why Carrizales had been singled out and 
turned in by her nurses and hospital. This whole thing began, they suggested, 
because of "personality conflicts" between Carrizales and the nurses. 
Carrizales was a "serious doctor" and "not gregarious." In fact, she was 
"abrasive" and "assertive" and "distant" at times. She wasn't "touchy-feely." 
She didn't ask nurses, she told nurses. She was not the nurses' buddy. Men like 
that, her supporters observed, are called "aggressive"; women like that are 
called "bitches."  
</P>
<P>
 "Usually a male doctor is in charge," said Dr. Beth Killebrew, an obstetrician 
who belongs to Carrizales' church. "That's what this is about. A female doctor 
has to be different than a male. Women don't like being bossed by another 
woman. She has to get nurses to be partners. She can't just give orders." 
</P>
<P>
 At least a few, among them members of the medical community in the greater 
Atlanta area, felt inclined to question the medical examiner's methods and 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton was no stranger to such controversy. Well before the Carrizales case, 
he'd aroused animosity among other doctors. Part of the bad feeling derived 
from Burton's perceived willingness to testify about what highly trained 
specialists should or should not do; part derived from his perceived 
willingness to "follow the money" and testify for the defense as well as the 
prosecution; part derived from the fact that Burton hadn't passed all the exams 
required to be a board-certified forensic pathologist.  
</P>
<P>
 None of these matters, however, agitated the medical community as much as his 
report on Carrizales. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton's conclusions are based on possibly unreliable witnesses' statements, 
not hard scientific evidence, complained experts such as Kris Sperry, the 
deputy medical examiner in Fulton County (Atlanta). The autopsy yielded no 
evidence of suffocation, no bruises on the neck, nothing. Even if Carrizales 
had applied pressure to the carotid arteries, you couldn't say for sure this 
had hastened death; babies' brains were much more resilient to blood-flow 
interruptions than adults'. Nor could you make much of the gasps and lingering 
heartbeat; newborns, being very primitive organisms, have a propensity for 
involuntary brain-stem reflexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like, oh my God, the baby is trying to breathe," Sperry said. "But 
no, it's just muscles firing. I think Dr. Carrizales, because involuntary 
muscle reflex is so disturbing, wanted to hold the baby until it stopped, so 
she then could hand him to the mother still, without this twitching. This is 
not unreasonable. I've seen it myself, and it's not pleasant to see. It can be 
devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the merits or flaws of these various arguments and objections, it 
eventually became clear that there was something else, as well, driving many of 
those who'd risen to defend Carrizales. The doctor's indictment had aroused, in 
all sorts of people, certain instinctive and heartfelt attitudes toward death. 
Over and over, discussions here in Georgia about the Carrizales case have ended 
up focusing mainly on questions of how to let go of the dying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eva is real big on dignity in dying, on holding and rocking rather than 
hooking to machines and reading gauges," said Heidi Cornutt, a mother of four 
and a member of Carrizales' church discussion group, when asked about the 
murder charge. "I didn't realize she was a doctor when she told me how she'd 
held a dying baby. I thought she was a nurse, because I didn't think of doctors 
doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 "How we play out death is related to how we understand the idea of life," said 
Cheryl Maxfield, the associate pastor at Carrizales' church, who also wrote a 
letter to the Journal-Constitution's editor. "An understanding of an afterlife, 
which for Eva is very real, means death is not a failure. . . . There are many 
debates raging about the proper way to deal with death in our culture and 
society. . . . What is really on trial here is a society and a theology trying 
to decide how we deal with the art of healing and the reality of death." 
</P>
<P>
 One Saturday morning, 16 members of Carrizales' Sunday discussion group 
gathered at their church to discuss these matters and the doctor's situation. 
Eva Carrizales' journey from an impoverished Texas background has brought her 
deep into the affluent baby boomer culture. There were, among this church 
gathering of her supporters, an insurance agent, an attorney, an accountant, 
two doctors, a mechanical engineer, a metallurgist, an airline pilot, a funeral 
director and several who called themselves stay-at-home moms.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, they mainly expressed disbelief about the charge. "What she's 
accused of is anathema to her, to what she is," said Killebrew. "That she'd be 
accused of this doesn't fit. She would lay down her life for babies." 
</P>
<P>
 As the morning stretched on, though, the church group gradually, hesitantly, 
began saying that even if Carrizales had hastened a dying baby's death, they 
felt comfortable about it and supported her.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't hold it against her."  
</P>
<P>
 "What is death? Maybe that baby was dead, just gasping. Maybe Eva just stopped 
a reflexive involuntary reflex."  
</P>
<P>
 "What Eva did is what a committee's do-not-resuscitate order would do. Knowing 
Eva, I have confidence in what she decided."  
</P>
<P>
 "Eva would never do anything to harm a baby if maybe it would live."  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be different if it were a 5-year-old."  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be different if there'd been a 50-50 chance. But the baby was going 
to die within five minutes."  
</P>
<P>
 In time, the group began directing its fire at those who'd turned on 
Carrizales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody disagrees the baby was terminal," said Killebrew. "Why spend all this 
money and time over a fine line? It drives me up a tree." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel she's being thrown to the wolves," said Donald Harper, a Delta 
Airlines pilot. "The big thing is, you need to support your doctors. Why did 
the hospital turn her in?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is qualified to determine death in our society?" asked Associate Pastor 
Maxfield. "Is the legal community? Or is the doctor? That's the question. Are 
we going to let policemen decide who is dead, and when? Who is to decide?"  
</P>
<P>
 Not until the meeting was drawing to an end did it emerge that no one there, 
despite their passionate sincerity, had actually read the medical examiner's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only briefly looked at it," said Killebrew. "It was too much, too emotional 
for me. It was all a blur. I know this woman, know her character, know who she 
is. Whatever happened, it was right. I don't believe Eva smothered this baby, 
that she put a hand over his mouth. She just wouldn't do that. She wouldn't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Killebrew paused, looked down, considered. "It's all based on Eva's 
character," she finally said. "Most people don't know the details of the 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 s much as he might have liked to, Clayton County Dist. Atty. Robert Keller 
could not so readily avoid the medical examiner's report. By calling the baby's 
death a homicide, Joe Burton more or less had backed the prosecutor into a 
corner. "I didn't have a choice," Keller said. "Joe had a harder choice. The 
key for me was Burton and what he decided. If he says homicide, I have to act." 
</P>
<P>
 Additional impetus came soon after, when Keller learned of the questionable 
death of another baby under Carrizales' care. In this incident, in June, 1993, 
at nearby Henry General Hospital, Carrizales reportedly gave a severely 
premature baby girl with a failing heart rate a potentially dangerous straight 
shot of potassium chloride, rather than drip it in slowly, as is standard. This 
episode hadn't been reported at the time; only in the wake of the Southern 
Regional case were authorities hearing about it and investigating. Joe Burton 
wasn't saying Carrizales had deliberately done anything to cause this death, 
but in witnesses' accounts of Carrizales' comments and conduct at Henry 
General, Burton did think he saw a "pattern of response" that gave him 
"considerable concern." 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, Keller approached the Southern General case with much 
reluctance. Here was one of the most treacherous issues he'd faced in his 16 
years as district attorney, and here also was something of a personal issue. 
His brother was a doctor -- and a close friend of Eva Carrizales. Keller 
himself knew Carrizales well enough to have greeted her, at times in the past, 
with a hug. Inevitably, he found himself discussing this doctor's case with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prayed over what to do," Keller said. "I felt I represented Dr. Carrizales 
as much as anyone. How should we respond?" 
</P>
<P>
 Keller eventually fixed on a highly unusual plan. Instead of issuing an arrest 
warrant, he would hand the matter to a grand jury -- and he would let this 
grand jury hear witnesses for the defense as well as the prosecution. Keller 
had never done this before; grand juries usually hear only the prosecution's 
case. But Keller wanted this one to hear everything available, including 
Carrizales and her neonatology experts. They could all say whatever they 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone was going to put a murder tag on this one, Keller reasoned, it had 
to be the grand jury, not him. But maybe they wouldn't. If he allowed the 
defense witnesses, the doctor just might not be indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 That plainly was the hope of the dozen mothers marching outside the Clayton 
County Courthouse in Jonesboro on the morning of Nov. 10, carrying placards 
with messages such as "Dr. Carrizales Saves Babies Lives . . . Doesn't Kill 
Them" and "Thank You for My Little Miracle." Some held up their children, all 
onetime patients of Carrizales. As she passed by them and a gaggle of 
journalists on her way to testify before the grand jury, Carrizales flashed a 
"V" for victory sign. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, having told her story without a defense attorney present -- 
Keller wouldn't violate that grand jury custom -- Carrizales left the 
courthouse smiling. "It was great," she told reporters. "I love the baby. I 
have no problems with any of the nurses. I know that they had some concerns, 
some misconceptions. But it's all understandable. I just want to let baby 
Jiminez rest in peace. God bless us." 
</P>
<P>
 Following her to the stand were six respected neonatologists and pathologists 
called for the defense, among them the Fulton County deputy medical examiner, 
Kris Sperry. None of the experts endorsed the notion of mercy killing or 
"facilitating" a death. Instead, despite some differences, they basically 
focused on the lack of hard scientific evidence.  
</P>
<P>
 From his standpoint as a board-certified forensic pathologist, Sperry told the 
grand jurors, all he could say reliably was that the manner of death was 
"undetermined." To say more, he'd have to depend on the nurses' observations 
and interpretations, which would require making "a personal value judgment" 
that didn't fit with a scientific report. "I can't sew moonbeams together to 
get an answer," Sperry observed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to say why none of this had much effect on the grand jurors. 
Perhaps Keller's question -- "Then why did she do it, and say she did it?" -- 
had an impact. Perhaps it was Burton's response -- "I bet he wouldn't let me 
occlude his baby's carotids" -- when a pathologist suggested Carrizales' 
actions didn't kill the baby. Perhaps it was the unexpected revelation from a 
nurse at Henry General Hospital, who testified that Carrizales, while working 
with her there one evening, talked openly about baby Jiminez living for 20 
minutes after she'd blocked the flow of blood to his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the mix of reasons, the grand jurors, after listening to 18 witnesses 
over a stretch of 12 hours, needed only 20 minutes to deliberate. Shortly after 
10 p.m., apparently free from the tortured ambivalence surrounding them, the 
grand jurors voted to indict Carrizales on the charge of murder "with malice 
aforethought." 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the outcome anticipated by Keller and Burton. They thought the 
defense witnesses had persuaded the grand jurors. "The district attorney gave 
the grand jury every option he could to not indict," Burton said later. "I was 
surprised when the grand jury indicted her. I did not expect it." 
</P>
<P>
 The next afternoon, Carrizales turned herself in at the Clayton County 
Detention Facility. After she posted a $10,000 bond, authorities let her go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 A VAGUE UNEASE NOW COLORS the conversations of those who have brought 
Carrizales to account. Few appear comfortable with what has happened. Phone 
calls of inquiry are answered cautiously and only after much prodding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to do our jobs," says Maj. Frank Horgan of the Clayton County Police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We normally have a feeling of accomplishment," says Capt. Joe Reynolds, 
shaking his head. "Maybe it's a little less so in this case. There are no bad 
guys here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Regional medical director, Donald Lackey, feels a particular 
regret. "I wish I didn't have to be a witness at the trial," he says. "My 
testimony helped form the grand jury's decision. Dr. Carrizales could lose her 
license and go to jail for an act that doesn't deserve this kind of penalty. 
But I don't know what else to do. I have to give a truthful answer. If the 
district attorney asks me on the stand, I'd tell them I wish we didn't have to 
punish her."  
</P>
<P>
 Punish her they already have, however, a circumstance hard for them to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following her indictment, Carrizales rather publicly struggled 
with a self-destructive fit of depression. She told her husband to kill her in 
order to cash in a life insurance policy and put her out of her misery. She 
visited a psychiatrist. And she, with her husband, spoke unguardedly about all 
this to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter who visited her home. "This is 
what I did," she said while holding her forefinger and middle finger to the 
neck of the reporter, pressing firmly. "I love babies. . . . It's been a 
tremendous tragedy for my family." 
</P>
<P>
 The Carrizales family's financial ruin has been equally apparent. The doctor 
lost her reported annual income of $250,000 when she resigned her positions 
days after baby Jiminez's death. Later, her husband, saying he was too 
distracted to continue as a self-employed architect, began pumping gas evenings 
at a convenience store. With legal fees already reaching $100,000 -- in 
January, Carrizales retained Georgia's most renowned criminal defense attorney, 
Bobby Lee Cook -- the Carrizales' two older daughters had to leave the 
University of Texas. In February, the lender foreclosed on their Fayette County 
home, forcing them to move out.  
</P>
<P>
 If these signs of the Carrizales' downfall were not discomfiting enough, there 
were also the reports of the doctor's present activities to consider. Her 
church friends report she spends much time in downtown Atlanta, caring for the 
homeless and hungry, visiting prisoners, helping AIDs patients. Often she can 
be found at the Indian Health Service, where she plans to work "when this is 
over," and at the Trinity Soup Kitchen. "She walks the streets and goes places 
where we won't go," says Beth Killebrew. "She does what we all say we will or 
should do."  
</P>
<P>
 Monitoring these recurring reports of Carrizales' fate and her supporters' 
moods, Keller and Burton grapple still for a just response. Guilt and 
discomfort linger -- but so, too, does an unwillingness to ignore precisely 
what happened at Southern General -- and, for that matter, at Henry General. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Keller wishes everyone involved could at least address openly the 
fundamental issues raised by Carrizales' apparent conduct and, particularly, 
her comments. If such cases do happen all the time, if doctors always walk 
these fine lines, if doctors regularly make subjective judgments, if doctors do 
often prolong the death process pointlessly, if doctors should treat death 
differently -- let's talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not just say, yes, I did it?" Keller asked. "Why not say yes, the baby 
can't consent, the parents are incapable, so yes, I did it. I did it then, I'd 
do it tomorrow, I'd do it again and again and again." 
</P>
<P>
 As Keller offered that thought one morning, he half rose from his chair, his 
fist pounding the desk in frustration. Some 13 weeks had passed since 
Carrizales' indictment, and the district attorney had not yet gotten around to 
arranging the doctor's arraignment (and would not for four more months). He 
appeared in even less of a rush to schedule a trial.  
</P>
<P>
 Keller spoke almost wistfully about the unlikely prospect of a plea bargain, 
something Carrizales' lawyers flatly reject. "Why won't they consider a 
voluntary manslaughter charge?" he asked, standing now and leaning forward over 
his desk. "You could say it was an emotional moment; you could offer probation. 
I'm not offering, but I wonder. Ask her lawyers. Ask her lawyers why they won't 
consider that."  
</P>
<P>
 Keller kept talking as he began to pace his office. "I'm convinced her motive 
was to end suffering," he said. "But the family was not consulted. Does she 
have a right to do that? How do you translate that into a verdict? Into a 
sentence? You could argue the motive was compassionate. If so, what does it 
mean? Does mercy killing equal murder?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking of the coming trial, the unscheduled but unavoidable trial, Keller 
answered his own question. 
</P>
<P>
 "That," he said, "is what we're going to find out."

SKID ROW AGENCY'S GOAL: TAKE 500 OFF THE STREETS THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Skid Row-based agency expects to take more than 500 homeless people off the 
streets this year -- up nearly 100 from 1993 -- and place them into job 
training and employment programs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysalis, which has been assisting the homeless for nearly 10 years, mainly 
targets those in the area who have faced difficult or unfortunate financial 
circumstances, such as getting laid off or robbed, said agency President and 
Executive Director Karen Hallerman. 
</P>
<P>
 "They simply need a boost of self-esteem and the opportunity to help 
themselves," Hallerman said. "So far this year, we have found jobs for 308 of 
our clients, and anticipate that we will exceed our goal to place more than 500 
homeless men and women in jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency operates on a $1-million budget and recently received a boost of 
$126,000 from a May fund-raiser. That amount was $11,000 more than what was 
raised last year, despite the tight economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysalis, at 516 S. Main St., offers counseling and education on how to look 
for and keep jobs as well as computer training courses. The program also serves 
as a temporary hiring agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception, Chrysalis has served 2,000 homeless and poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 About 85% of the estimated 80,000 homeless in Los Angeles County are either 
mentally ill or have an alcohol or drug problem, but Hallerman said Chrysalis 
screens out its clients to find the 15% who are alcohol- or drug-free and are 
motivated to work.

 Pacific World of Cobblers is a place that's always rolling in dough. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years, this tiny Crenshaw-area bakery has been turning out specialty 
cobblers worthy of a mention in the Michelin Guide Book restaurant survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Taste the cobblers and you'll see why. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular choice is peach cobbler. Blackberry, filled with fruit and 
light on the sugar, is another favorite. Others include raspberry, blueberry, 
cherry, apple and sweet potato. 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery requests 24 hours' notice for orders. Cobblers can also be 
purchased frozen and baked at home. For last-minute shoppers, the bakery's 
display case always has a few cobblers available. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific World of Cobblers, located in a mini-mall between a beauty parlor and 
a barber shop, was opened by Janie Lee Bradford, who died last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, she had developed a lifelong love of cooking. When Bradford 
became dissatisfied with her career as a parole officer, she quit and purchased 
a restaurant in the Crenshaw district. The restaurant thrived for more than 15 
years until she discovered that selling cobbler as a side business was equally 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the bakery is still family-owned and operated by Bradford's husband, 
Erex, and daughter Cathie.

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; COUNTY'S HOSPITAL CARE FOR SICK DATES TO 1850S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County began caring for the sick as early as 1850, when the county 
of 3,530 people established a hospital fund to pay doctors for the care of the 
indigent. 
</P>
<P>
 In her 1979 book "The History of the Los Angeles County Hospital," Helen 
Eastman Martin chronicles the early buildings and wards for tuberculosis and 
leprosy, and the need for the 20-story General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The first county hospital was established May 29, 1858, when county 
supervisors secured the home of Cristobal Aguilar, an alcalde under Mexican 
rule and mayor when California became part of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, the adobe on North 
Spring Street or North Broadway (records are unclear) provided a "charity ward" 
and another for patients who could pay. It had four rooms with eight cots for 
patients and two for the sisters. Martin's book cites records showing that in 
its first seven months, 52 county patients and 11 private patients were 
admitted; 10 died. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1860, the county hospital moved to a two-story brick building on Naud 
Street between North Main and San Fernando streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's population continued to grow as railroads were completed and word 
of California's climate spread. More and more "health seekers" from the East 
who were suffering from tuberculosis reached California with no money to pay 
for their care. 
</P>
<P>
 The evolution of 20th-Century county hospitals reflects the medical 
establishment's own growth, from single wards and few surgeries to semiprivate 
rooms and medical specialization. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital expanded from 1897 to 1919. Nurses cottages (including one for 
black nurses), a jail and insane ward, two medical buildings, a 
contagious-disease building, a morgue, administration building and a 
tuberculosis ward were built during this time. The brick structures replaced 
old, shaky wood buildings on Mission Road, which was nearly impassable in wet 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "By 1933, the hospital wards were bulging and most were very dingy. The 
hospital admissions had increased from 12,443 in 1920 to 38,144 (total 
patients) in 1932-1933, without a proportionate increase in beds. There were 
1,283 beds in 1920 and 1,494 beds in 1932. The move to the new (General 
Hospital) was urgently needed," Martin writes. 
</P>
<P>
 As General Hospital was nearing completion, the Long Beach earthquake struck 
March 10, 1933, damaging the State Street hospital buildings that were being 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, this year's Jan. 17 Northridge quake damaged 16 buildings at 
County-USC Medical Center. Among the buildings closed were the Pediatric 
Pavilion and the Psychiatric Hospital. The Federal Emergency Management Agency 
agreed to pay $400 million toward the new hospital's construction instead of 
earmarking funds to replace the damaged buildings -- which would then have been 
demolished for the project.

 Sixty-Sixth Street Elementary School has been awarded a $2,450 grant from the 
Kaiser Permanente Watts Counseling and Learning Center to support the school's 
annual reading Olympics. 
</P>

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: SILENT SCREENS; ENCORE FOR 
CARTER, OLD MOVIE DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For six months in 1926, Gaylord Carter watched MGM's "Ben Hur" almost every 
night as he played the silent film's musical score on the Million Dollar 
Theater's house organ. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night at the Orpheum (another relic from the Downtown movie 
district), the 88-year-old organist will again get the chance to see what he 
describes as one of his favorite films -- and he won't even have to work the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, along with ticket holders for the Los Angeles Conservancy's Last 
Remaining Seats series, will watch a restored print of the film and hear the 
praise of fellow film buffs, who are planning a tribute to Carter, once 
Southern California's pre-eminent silent-film organist. The series, in which 
classic films are shown in downtown L.A. movie palaces, takes place each 
Wednesday in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do when people say they want to say some nice things about you?" 
the semi-retired Carter asks rhetorically. "They said a friend of mine would 
sit and play the organ and I'd get to take bows and be introduced by Leonard 
Maltin." 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, the ornate Orpheum Theater, at 842 S. Broadway, also will be taking 
a bow Wednesday as it again presents the kind of grand-scale entertainment it 
was built for in 1926 (it still shows first-run films, usually with Spanish 
subtitles). "Ben Hur," directed by Fred Niblo, was filmed at a budget of $4 
million, a record for its day; its chariot race and sea battle are thought to 
be as impressive as those of the 1959 version that starred Charlton Heston. The 
film is in black-and-white, with some sequences in two-color Technicolor. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was familiar with many of the classic theaters during their glory days. 
He remembers moving to Los Angeles with his family in 1922 and being very 
impressed with the Million Dollar Theater on Broadway. A few years later, he 
became the theater's head organist, and he played the musical scores for many 
films, including "Ben Hur." "It was the first time a movie ever lasted six 
months in Los Angeles," he says. "I was bowled over by it. . . . It's a 
phenomenal score -- the music for the galley slave scene is tremendous."  
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1920s, "talkies" had started to replace silent films, and by 1935, 
after working at several other theaters, Carter went into radio. He still 
remembers the old theaters fondly, though, and when the conservancy started 
Last Remaining Seats in 1987, it hired him to accompany some of the silent 
films it presented, an experience he says he enjoyed. Carter rarely plays now, 
though, and on Wednesday the "Ben Hur" score will be performed by his friend 
and colleague Stan Kann. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Davidson, the conservancy's associate director, hopes that shows such as 
this tribute and the vaudeville celebration will help make a public accustomed 
to seeing films on mall multiplex screens aware of the historical importance of 
the downtown theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started this, the naysayers said no one will go downtown to an old 
theater to see an old movie in the middle of the summer," Davidson says, adding 
that each show attracts about 1,500 people. "But we get a number of people who 
have never seen a movie in a theater with a balcony. The older people (go) for 
nostalgia. And the movie people -- seeing a classic film on a big screen is a 
different experience." 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Carter's career has paralleled that of the Broadway theaters. "We 
feel that as the conservancy works to preserve architectural landmarks, we are 
honoring Gaylord Carter as a living landmark," says Bill Gorin, the chairman of 
the conservancy's theater committee.

VOICES: INSPIRING LANDSCAPE; LIVING IN AND EXPLORING THE DOWNTOWN AREA IS AN 
IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THIS ARTIST'S WORK. EVERYTHING IS COLORFUL AND LOUD AND IT'S 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO IGNORE THE POWER OF THE STREET. 
</P>

By KIM ABELES, Kim Abeles, 41, is an environmental and biographical artist and 
photographer. She has lived in an artist's studio Downtown since early 1980. 
She received nationwide publicity a few years ago for her smog artelaborate 
stencils she affixes to plexiglass and various objects and leaves on her 
rooftop for days or weeks so that dirty air particles fall on it and actually 
form the picture. A 15-year survey of her work, sponsored by the Fellows of 
Contemporary Art, appeared at the Santa Monica Museum last fall and is 
traveling through the United States and Europe. Abeles and her 5-year-old 
daughter, Zoe, live in a studio near Santa Fe and Washington in the southern 
part of Downtown. She was interviewed by Karen E. Klein.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Being an artist living downtown has been really critical to my work. The 
language of my art has developed around the urban experience. If I ever moved, 
I would be concerned about the impact on my work. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most important issues in my work is living in a downtown area and 
exploring the urban experience and wondering where nature is in relation to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I came Downtown, I lived in Ohio in a grain silo, canned all my own 
food and had a garden. I did a craft book on country living. Then suddenly I 
came to Los Angeles. At first I lived in Topanga Canyon and then within a year 
and a half I got a studio in Downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot happened to my artwork and my vision. That first studio was at 2nd and 
Broadway in the old Victor Clothing building. It was hard for me to go into the 
ivory tower of the Victor Clothing building and make ethereal, romantic, 
layered artwork and then go outdoors and see the harsh beauty of how people 
have to live on the streets of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, everything was colorful and loud and in your face. I couldn't really 
ignore the power of what was on the street and what people had to do to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 I do installation art, sculpture and photography. I really miss my old studio 
in the Victor Clothing building because I was able to do a lot of pieces just 
looking out my window. There is a very vibrant street life on Broadway. I did 
biographies about the lives of the shoeshine vendors in sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I did a major piece where I tried to photograph north on Broadway looking 
toward the San Gabriel Mountains. I saw the mountains once on a very clear day 
and it was pretty breathtaking. So I took a photograph from my fire escape 
looking north every day until I got a clear view again. It took a year and two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs I took in that series had a lot to do with what was occurring 
on the street as well as trying to locate nature. Broadway is a major parade 
street, so during the time I took the photos, the Pope went by, there was a 
Lakers parade and there was the Street Scene festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time I did a pollution piece where I walked from 2nd and Broadway to 
the foot of the San Gabriels on the first smog- alert day of the year. It took 
me about a year to get the courage up to do that. I went as the crow flies. I 
wore a pedometer, took a compass, went over and under freeways, knocked on 
doors and went through yards, over barbed wire fences. I took photos every time 
I made an intersection -- even just two paths crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 At times there were so many children following me it looked like I was the 
Pied Piper. At other times mothers would dash out of their houses and say, 
'Honey, you'd better be careful in this neighborhood.' It took 10 1/2 hours and 
I walked 16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 That was one of the first times I got to really experience the city. 
Typically, you observe things from your automobile, along prescribed routes, 
and you barely get to see a human being. It's only when you walk or live in 
your neighborhood for a long time that you get to know what the city is 
composed of. 
</P>
<P>
 My experience has a lot to do with trying to locate my voice in a city and in 
a bureaucracy where it's very hard to find a voice. That's why graffiti is 
everywhere. My 5-year-old and I drive to day care a lot of times and we see 
someone doing graffiti. I try to explain that those are just people trying to 
find their voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids, particularly, need to locate ways of connecting and of talking to each 
other. I teach art in the Skid Row area with Para Los Ninos and the Heart 
Project. As an artist, my participation down here is really strengthened when I 
can connect with these Skid Row kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it is art that gives us civilized culture. Art used to be the tools 
that we made and the implements we ate from and the homes we lived in. It 
wasn't a separate entity that was observed from outside in a plastic box. 
</P>
<P>
 When I leave Downtown, I feel very uncomfortable and unconnected. On the 
Westside, for example, things seem too tidy to me. When my daughter and I drive 
to day care along a pretty rough street, we always pick out the house we want 
to live in. I don't think you'd find many people from the Westside doing that! 
They'd be more concerned about whether their windows were up and their doors 
were locked. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest thing we need is to be talking to each other. If we put our heads 
into the sand about racism or pollution, nothing good is going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Art is a perfect connector and conduit for that. When you get into science and 
social science, it's too much about numbers. People can't connect with that in 
a humanist fashion. Art is a possibility to make a non-vocal connection. Art is 
hard to explain. It speaks to our souls.

VOICES: THE BIG PICTURE; AFTER A DECADE OF DECLINE BROUGHT ON BY THE RECESSION, 
THE DOWNTOWN ARTISTS DEVELOPMENT ASSN. IS WORKING TO REVITALIZE THE 
ONCE-THRIVING ART SCENE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON PETERSON, Jon Peterson, 49, is a painter who has lived in the Central 
City art district since 1975. He also is a Downtown building owner and founded 
a real estate partnership that manages property in the Downtown area. He is 
president of the Downtown Artists Development Assn., a nonprofit group formed 
last year in an effort to revitalize the downtown arts scene. He was 
interviewed by Karen E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I moved Downtown when I was 30, in 1975. At that time there were almost no 
artists living Downtown. There were only two or three studios. A friend of mine 
had moved into one of them when I was graduating from art school and I liked 
it, so I found one for myself. 
</P>
<P>
 I moved into what had been a commercial garment manufacturing space in Little 
Tokyo. It was empty when I moved in. I paid $75 a month for 2,500 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, my studio was pretty raw. A lot of my friends came down to see it 
and thought I was absolutely crazy to move into it. It was a big, empty, very 
dirty warehouse. All it had really was a toilet, but I did a lot of work to 
make it livable. It ended up being a very beautiful space. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1975 to 1980, a lot of artists moved into very similar spaces all over 
Downtown. There were a lot on Broadway, there were artists' lofts that 
stretched from the Santa Monica Freeway to Chinatown to the Los Angeles River. 
Lots of artists were attracted by the big spaces and the cheap rents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very beginning, when everybody first started moving in, there would be 
two or three new studios opening every week. People would throw potluck dinners 
and they'd get everybody together.  
</P>
<P>
 There were a lot of galleries that opened in the late '70s and early '80s. 
Most of them have left now, but a lot of new ones have taken their place. The 
galleries came in along with the artists, taking advantage of spaces and low 
rents. 
</P>
<P>
 When LACE (Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions) came, that became a center 
for artists to gather. Of course there were also lots of galleries and shows to 
go to. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorky's came in 1982. It was not really part of the original early art scene. 
It was a nice place, but the places that people ate at regularly are the ethnic 
restaurants, places in Little Tokyo and Chinatown.  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, the artist district leveled off. A lot of the galleries that 
were here in the early '80s left. Most could not survive for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, a lot of people have said that the Downtown art scene was 
dead. Well, it's not dead. Last year, we formed DADA to encompass art, music, 
performance art, poetry, all the arts. We have 280 members. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things we did was to take a survey of artists living 
Downtown. Our best estimate is that there are about 1,800 studio spaces down 
here. From 1975 (when there were no studios) to 1990 (with 1,800) there was 
impressive growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Living down here now, I get the same feeling I had when I first moved here in 
1975. There are a lot of spaces available because of the recession. Prices have 
come down and landlords are more willing to work with people to make things 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope maybe some galleries will come down here and open again and take 
advantage of the fact that there are still a lot of artists here. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, DADA held a huge art show in conjunction with the Los Angeles Art 
Fair. We had 400 artists in the show, and 4,000 people were there on opening 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a vision for what I think the Downtown artist district could really be 
like. I hope it will be a thriving art community, with galleries and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 That almost happened in the '70s. If we'd had a little bit of help from the 
city at that time it could have happened.

PROGRAM CUTBACKS ARE POUND-FOOLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent excellent article "A Diamond in the Rough Sparkles" about Damon 
Bihm (Sports, May 15), dramatically illustrates the value of athletics and 
other worthwhile programs in shaping young lives, especially those from the 
inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairness decrees we mention that although Los Angeles City College Coach Dan 
Cowgill dropped Damon from the program, he reinstated him twice with the 
backing of Seattle Mariners scout Fate Young and sports agent Chuck Stone.If he 
hadn't been reinstated, the odds of him reaching Talladega College would have 
been remote. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of his godparents can't be overstated -- they were there when his 
life was at a crossroads, and they maintained him in an educational 
environment, allowing the window of opportunity to open. With him, they seized 
the opportunity. His life is now moving, from a high-risk future to one of 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Not sensational or bizarre enough to gain media attention the normal way, his 
story illustrates the daily battles that rage and the fine line between victor 
and victim. His story can touch and inspire others who still struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 If only our leaders and society could grasp the message, in an era of 
cutbacks, that cuts can be penny rich in the short run, but often dollar poor 
in the long haul -- "cheaper a kid to Yale, than to jail." It's not only 
morally but financially more feasible to save than salvage.

WRITERS GROUP WAS 'INFILTRATED' BY IGNORANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his essay "What About the Plan?" (Voices, May 22), Randy Holland states: 
"The city was not only neglected but sabotaged, either consciously or 
unconsciously, by the system. In some ways it was conscious, like the 
out-and-out sabotage of cultural organizations like the Watts Writers Workshop, 
which started in the wake of the '65 riots . . . which was infiltrated by the 
FBI and the LAPD." Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 19, I was briefly a member of the Watts Writers Workshop. I left 
in an outrage because the workshop was "infiltrated" by a "system" of 
ignorance, bluster and silliness. 
</P>
<P>
 What started out as a serious effort rapidly devolved into a boisterous 
kaffeeklatsch. After attending several sessions, I was disappointed to discover 
that while male participants were lauded and praised for virtually every word 
they wrote, the women writers were dumped on, unfairly criticized and 
belittled. There was also an unhealthy undercurrent of liberal do-goodism -- 
the exploitation of blacks for the sake of photo opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 That no work of solid literary merit came of that workshop speaks for itself. 
In order to learn the critical lessons I needed to become a writer, I had to 
seek out other mentors and workshops like the defunct Fiction Writers West and 
a fledgling workshop in Venice Beach called Beyond Baroque that had just opened 
its doors.

"BUENOS DIIIIIIIAS, LOS ANNNNNGELES!!"; IS IT THE LOYAL AUDIENCE? THE POPULAR 
MUSIC? THE HILARIOUS DJS? KLAX-FM'S DOMINATION OF THE RATINGS IN THE COUNTRY'S 
BIGGEST MARKET IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALL THAT AND ONE OTHER CRUCIAL FACTOR: SE 
HABLA ESPANOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Claudia Puig is a Times staff writer who covers the radio 
industry. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 6 o'clock on a spring morning at the cramped, slightly shabby Hollywood 
headquarters of KLAX-FM. "La X" (pronounced eh-keece), as it's known to 
listeners, is already humming with energy and the oom-pah-pah strains of the 
upbeat Mexican music that's called banda.  
</P>
<P>
 The hub of activity is a small control room, adorned only with a utilitarian 
clock, two wallet-sized religious cards and a large map with U.S. Census data 
showing the huge Latino population clustered in Southern California. Filling 
the room with loud-mouthed antics is the baby-faced morning team of Juan Carlos 
Hidalgo and El Peladillo (a.k.a. Jesus Garcia). The twentysomething pair were 
teen-agers when they left Michoacan and crossed the border illegally in the 
mid-'80s. They started out humbly, eking out a living picking fruit before 
launching their improbable radio careers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the booming style of Robin Williams, Hidalgo bellows: "Buenos Diiiiiias, 
Los Annnngeles! El show mas loco de la radio en espanol . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it the craziest show?" interrupts Peladillo (in rapid-fire Spanish). 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . and the most persecuted by . . . " continues Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 "By whom?" Peladillo interjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "By Howard Stern," explains Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 " Ayyyy , Howard Stern! The monkey, the honest-to-God monkey," shrieks 
Peladillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo and Peladillo regularly take digs at the self-proclaimed "King of All 
Media" and have every right to do so. For much of the past year, the duo has 
hosted the most popular show in the market, besting the nationally syndicated 
Stern and local veterans such as Rick Dees. Their success, and the wild 
popularity of banda , have been critical to KLAX's topping the ratings for the 
past year and a half. At first surprisingly, now tellingly, a Spanish-language 
station is ruling the airwaves in the pop music capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a fluke? Some argue that because there are fewer Spanish stations in the 
market, there is less fragmentation of the audience; and some competitors are 
imitating KLAX's format in an attempt to steal listeners. Others attribute the 
success to a music and dance fad; the most recent ratings, while still showing 
KLAX on top, reflect a significant drop in overall numbers. And while KLAX 
management says that the station's advertising revenue grew from $4 million in 
1992 to $20 million in 1993, KLAX cannot command the same rates as its 
English-language counterparts. It must still fight the notion -- common in all 
media -- that the English-speaking market is where the action is. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, KLAX's rise is unparalleled and continues to astound the industry. It 
is a ratings and financial success that has much to do with the uncommon bond 
between the station and the community it serves. It is also a sociological 
phenomenon -- more evidence that the physical and cultural border established 
almost 150 years ago between Mexico and the United States is becoming 
increasingly blurred. 
</P>
<P>
 LIFE HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN ROSY FOR THE STATION AT 97.9 ON THE DIAL. BEFORE KLAX 
became a Spanish radio sensation, it was a Spanish radio flop. Formerly KSKQ, 
and programmed out of Miami, it drew negligible ratings in a market where the 
most popular stations are those featuring easy-listening rock, Top 40, talk or 
other formats that draw the prized demographic of 25- to 54-year-old English 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. area -- with 80 or so stations, 45 of them of commercial significance 
-- is the biggest, most profitable market in the country. Because of a wealth 
of commuters and an aversion to public transportation, the relationship between 
listener and radio has blossomed, and the ethnic mix has allowed for more 
format experimentation. Local Spanish radio dates to 1944, when KWKW started 
employing a part-time Spanish format and switched over completely a few years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spanish stations have historically had little ratings success here. All of 
that changed in January, 1993, when KLAX appeared at the top of the ratings -- 
the first time ever for a Spanish-language station in Los Angeles. It has 
stayed there ever since, through six consecutive rating periods. (Nationally, 
among Spanish-speaking stations, only KXTN in San Antonio has approached KLAX's 
degree of success; KXTN, the only other No. 1 Spanish station in the country, 
first crowned the charts last year.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I held onto this station through the worst times possible," says Raul Alarcon 
Jr., a 38-year-old Cuban-born American who, with his father and father-in-law, 
bought the station for $15 million in 1988. Their company -- Spanish 
Broadcasting System -- also owns two stations in New York, two in Miami and one 
in Key Largo. "The ratings were horrible. We tried everything. We played all 
the top Hispanic artists (such as Julio Iglesias, Roberto Carlos and Ana 
Gabriel) and just could not make it happen. I kept saying: 'What is it that I'm 
missing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon credits Alfredo Alonso, then publisher of a Spanish radio trade 
publication, with the simple solution. "He called me one day and said: 'You 
have to go regional Mexican with the station.' I didn't know anything about 
that. So he put me in touch with Alfredo Rodriguez." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was then program director at KWKW-AM, a rival that was playing 
Mexican regional music and was among the most popular local Spanish stations. 
Ready for a new challenge, Rodriguez came on board as general manager in June, 
1992. Instead of relying on data from one of the many industry research firms, 
he talked to people in restaurants, dance clubs and neighborhood bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been an adventurer," says Rodriguez, 48, a native of Hermosillo 
who's been in L.A. nearly 15 years. "And I know my people." He found that 
despite the eight Spanish-language stations in Los Angeles, people of Mexican 
descent felt there wasn't a station that catered specifically to them. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest U.S. Census, there are 3.3 million Latinos in L.A. 
County, most of Mexican origin -- the largest population of Mexican-born 
residents outside of Mexico City. The border has always been a free-trade zone 
for culture and that certainly applied to banda . The music originated during 
the second half of the 19th-Century, when German immigrants brought the brass 
band to the border area. Updated with electronic instruments, banda surged to 
new heights of popularity in Mexico in the late '80s, and Rodriguez believed 
that its appeal would cross the border. Along with an emphasis on the music, 
Rodriguez visualized a station with a commitment to improving the image of 
Mexicans and instilling cultural pride. Crucially, he also hired away Hidalgo 
and Garcia from a San Francisco station. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he did basically was slant it in a very youthful, hip way," owner 
Alarcon said during a recent visit to Los Angeles. "He took a format 
traditionally looked upon as sleepy and revitalized it." 
</P>
<P>
 KSKQ became KLAX in August, 1992. When the January, 1993, ratings came out, 
industry insiders were baffled by KLAX's top position. Some joked that KLAX was 
a service of Los Angeles International Airport. Some stations charged Arbitron 
with erroneous reporting. Among those were Spanish-language rivals and classic 
rocker KLSX-FM, offering its similar call letters and neighboring dial position 
as evidence. Howard Stern, whose show is carried on KLSX, ranted about how his 
audience had been mistakenly attributed to "some Mexican station." 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitron painstakingly checked its data and confirmed KLAX's victory. After 
their second ratings win, Rodriguez, Hidalgo and Peladillo sent Stern a funeral 
wreath with a note reading: "Thanks for helping us remain No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 MARIA AND RIGOBERTO ROJAS OF SOUTH LOS ANGELES SIT EXPECTANTLY IN KLAX's 
cramped lobby, accompanied by their son, daughter and two nephews -- all young 
teens. "We wanted to get to know the announcers," says Rigoberto, adding almost 
apologetically: "We wanted to ask for a CD if possible." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only radio station we've ever visited," adds Maria. "We came by 
once before. Now the kids wanted to come too." They are greeted solicitously 
and shown the control rooms by Carlos Velasco, a deejay at KLAX's sister AM 
station, KXED, which plays vintage Mexican music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry there are no CDs available," Velasco says politely. "Next time you 
come . . ." He turns to one of the boys and ruffles his hair. "In school?" The 
boy nods solemnly. "Very good. We want good students," Velasco says jovially. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is taken to meet Peladillo. Their anticipation is palpable and the 
kids and Maria giggle excitedly when introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "How did you picture him?" Velasco asks. "Tall? Fat? Mustachioed?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Pancho Villa," answers Rigoberto, and everyone laughs heartily. 
</P>
<P>
 They are ushered into a small office to chat with their hero and emerge laden 
with compact discs and posters, courtesy of Peladillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing their audience such face-to-face accessibility is one reason for the 
morning duo's rise to regional renown. But most important is the fast pace of 
their 6 a.m.-10 a.m. program modeled after the popular "morning zoo" format 
common on English-language stations during the '80s. The balance of KLAX's 
broadcast day is a more traditional mix of music, news and deejay patter, but 
listeners have swarmed to the silly antics, phone pranks and wacky sound 
effects served up by Hidalgo and Peladillo. For example, a deep-voiced 
announcer will intone: "KLAX, the favorite station of the White House." Also, 
it is Peladillo's habit to warble whatever -- and whenever -- he pleases. At 
the top of his lungs. And considerably off-key. After a recent on-the-air 
serenade, his partner remarked: " Ayyyy! How awful you sing!" 
</P>
<P>
 Peladillo: "And you sound like Sinatra? Why do you make fun of my singing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo: "I don't make fun of it. It just makes me cry." 
</P>
<P>
 El Peladillo was an early nickname for Cantinflas, the raggedy alter ego of 
the late Mexican comedian Mario Moreno. The character is similar to Charlie 
Chaplin's Little Tramp, but with a crude tongue. Garcia says he idolized 
Cantinflas and has modeled his Peladillo after the lovable scoundrel "who talks 
a lot but doesn't say anything." But to define KLAX's morning show as mindless 
jabber would seriously underestimate its content. The hosts routinely interject 
political and social commentary. Like everyone else connected with the station, 
they feel strongly about being agents for change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to have pride in our race, so we put in some advice," Hidalgo 
says. "We feel a sense of responsibility to do right. We feel awful about gangs 
and people shooting each other. We talk about getting a good education. We 
don't do jokes that offend people. I don't want to preach; my job is to 
entertain. But we talk about the governor, immigration, discrimination -- 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Hidalgo has launched a mock gubernatorial bid in an effort to 
inspire listeners to vote, and also to criticize Gov. Pete Wilson. "He's using 
immigration like a political campaign for publicity," says Hidalgo. "How can 
the governor talk about these people when they provide the food on his table? 
They're humble, but they pay taxes like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration is a subject these two know a little about. Garcia was twice 
caught trying to cross the border, he says, but he refused to return to 
Michoacan, where opportunity was scarce. In 1985, his third try was successful. 
He made his way to Santa Paula, where he picked avocados and later worked at a 
Thrifty drugstore while attending broadcasting school at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo says he made it past the Border Patrol on his first try in 1984, 
smuggled inside the spare tire compartment of a station wagon. He picked 
strawberries before wrangling a sales job in 1987 at a Spanish radio station in 
Oxnard. He was also given an overnight announcing shift. During the time he was 
going to broadcast school, and while the morning deejay was on vacation, 
Hidalgo filled in and encouraged management to try the "zoo" format. Hidalgo 
was eventually given the morning shift. He brought on his sidekick the 
following year, after meeting Garcia -- in his Peladillo guise -- at a 
Halloween party. They moved to a San Francisco station and, learning of KLAX's 
make-over, sent a tape of their show to Rodriguez, whom Hidalgo had once met. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Garcia and Hidalgo are now legal residents, both recently married and 
each with an infant, but they are not far from their immigrant experience. "Now 
we're basking in our glory, but there were some very hard times," says Garcia. 
"That's why we can relate to our audience. We're just like them." 
</P>
<P>
 THERE'S A MAGIC NUMBER IN OUR SOCIETY, A MILESTONE WHETHER IT REFERS to loot, 
land or, in this case, listeners. "Nobody in Spanish radio had ever come close 
to the million mark before, which KLAX has surpassed," says researcher Allen 
Klein, onetime consultant to the station, referring to KLAX's cumulative 
listenership. That's the estimated number of people who tune in for at least 
five minutes in any quarter hour between 6 a.m. and midnight. KLAX's impressive 
audience size reflects the growing Latino population in L.A. County, now nearly 
40%, according to Census data. By the year 2000 it is projected to approach 
50%. According to Hidalgo's estimates, considerably more than half of KLAX's 
audience is bilingual . That alone distinguishes "La X" from its 
Spanish-language competitors, which cater primarily to Latinos who are 
monolingual. 
</P>
<P>
 And KLAX officials love to tout the wide spectrum of ages represented in their 
audience, an uncommon phenomenon among L.A. stations. The percentage of 
listeners in various age ranges reveals a close reflection of the U.S. Census 
Bureau's local demographic breakdown. For example, the median age among Latinos 
here is 25 (31 for Anglos) and, Klein says, the largest percentage of KLAX 
listeners falls into the 25-34 group. Asked if an English station will ever be 
No. 1 in L.A. again, Klein responds: "It's going to be very tough." 
</P>
<P>
 While the station's ratings for the first quarter of this year slipped 
considerably, to the second-lowest showing of its 18-month reign, station 
officials attribute the downturn to fallout from the January earthquake. 
April's trends, according to Arbitron, again show KLAX on an upward swing. Most 
industry watchers, even rivals, predict KLAX's continued success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a function of competition," says Richard Heftel, general manager of 
KTNQ-KLVE, L.A.'s former Spanish radio leaders. "You've got dozens of 
(English-language) stations chasing two-thirds of the population and a handful 
of Spanish stations chasing (the other third). If there's a proliferation of 
Spanish stations, then there will be fragmentation. And that would make it 
easier for an English station to be No. 1." But for now, he doesn't see that 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Heftel points to research showing that Latinos turn to radio primarily for 
news about their community and to preserve cultural ties. And KLAX has given 
Spanish-language radio a newfound legitimacy. Though three other Spanish 
stations entered the local Top 10 during the '80s, none had ever approached the 
status of KLAX. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going on at this station is a social revolution," says KLAX sales 
manager Jack McVeigh. "This is Little Mexico now. They're going back to their 
heritage and pride in their culture and customs as a family unit. And KLAX is 
their station. Wherever we go, they want to go. There were 10,000 people at the 
Tianguis (grocery store) in El Monte on Super Bowl Sunday to hear live music 
and meet their favorite announcers." 
</P>
<P>
 McVeigh, a self-described "gringo" (most of the sales staff is not Latino), 
was raised in El Paso. His grandfather owned Spanish stations in Juarez and 
Tijuana. A broadcaster for more than 30 years, McVeigh came to Los Angeles in 
the mid-'80s and spent six years at Spanish stations before joining KLAX in 
1992. "We've gotten Spanish radio to a new level," he says. "Now, most 
blue-chip advertising clients in L.A. and nationwide recognize KLAX for what it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 KLAX research indicates that L.A. and Orange County Latinos spend about $45 
billion annually on consumer goods. In recent years, advertisers have 
increasingly pursued that market. According to McVeigh, KLAX had about 150 
advertisers in 1992 and currently has a roster of about 1,000 clients ranging 
from Anheuser-Busch, Nissan, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Miller beer, 
Lucky supermarkets and Thrifty drugstores, to smaller retailers and 
neighborhood stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Ad rates are directly tied to ratings. But despite ratings, it has long been 
an industry given that time on Spanish stations is much cheaper than on 
English-speaking stations. The rationale: There are more English-speaking 
consumers, and they have more discretionary income. 
</P>
<P>
 KLAX has not yet achieved equality, ranking 10th in local advertising revenue. 
One of the market leaders for the past several years has been easy-listening 
KOST-FM, whose rates range from $700 to $1,500 per 60-second spot. KLAX is 
closing in on those figures, McVeigh says, charging anywhere from $700-$1,200 
per minute. However, KLAX still lags way behind rock station KLOS-FM, which 
commands $1,800-$2,000 per minute and ranked 16th in the most recent ratings. 
"We're just looking for parity," McVeigh says. "We're not there yet. But we 
have closed the gap." 
</P>
<P>
 MARTA DOMINGUEZ, 22, AND Imelda Flores, 19, are at KLAX on a mission for their 
Inglewood-based banda club, Invacion Musical. They have come to promote a dance 
to raise funeral expenses for a murdered club member. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances surrounding the death are unclear -- or else the young women 
don't want to discuss them with a stranger. But they are committed to helping 
their late friend's mother in Zacatecas even though they have never met her. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of ourselves not as a club but as a family," says Dominguez, 
cradling her 2-month-old daughter. "Juan Carlos and Peladillo have announced it 
when they have the opportunity. This is the only station that would help like 
this. All they tell you is they don't want any flyers with guns or showing 
violence. They're helping people put away their guns." 
</P>
<P>
 The poignancy of this station credo in relation to their murdered friend does 
not escape the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're grateful," says Flores. "(Station personnel) didn't know him, but 
they're helping him, showing that we Latinos are all together in this." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-year-old Sergio Ruiz, a self-described former " cholito ," has 
dropped by the station on one of his regular visits. Slight and sweet-faced, he 
stands awkwardly, smiling tentatively. It's hard to imagine him as a 
gangbanger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come here lots of times," he relays in an excited whisper. "The people here 
will actually talk to you. I'm Mexican and it's my music. Before listening to 
this, I was a cholo . Then I joined a quebradita (dance) club. It's inspired me 
not to go wrong. Now, I like to work, and yesterday I called a school to learn 
English." 
</P>
<P>
 But his decision to give up gang life didn't sit well with his buddies around 
Normandie Avenue and 8th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "They beat me up when I left the gang," Ruiz says. "But I wanted to get out 
before I got killed and, thanks to 'La X,' my whole thinking is different. My 
father is so much happier with me. I've changed a lot. I dress differently. I 
like to talk, to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz is no anomaly. "We've been practically dismantling the gangs," general 
manager Rodriguez says, "and getting kids to join social clubs -- using every 
means possible. Other broadcasters don't understand that. This is more than a 
radio station. It's a positive movement toward change. God, we need that!" 
</P>
<P>
 The station routinely broadcasts public-service announcements about the value 
of staying in school and the perils of drug and alcohol use. The messages, 
narrated by young listeners, differ from run-of-the-mill spots found elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, Hidalgo was brainstorming with colleagues about what the 
station could do to encourage listeners and make them proud to be Latino. It 
was his idea to pass the mike to the audience. Fans in their teens and 20s -- 
many of whom say they used to listen primarily to rap and dance stations -- 
regularly visit to record short saludos.  
</P>
<P>
 "They need someone, something to inspire them," says Elio Gomez, afternoon 
drive-time announcer and program director. "We treat them like brothers, family 
members, their defenders. They have a lot of respect for us, as we do for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, dozens of banda clubs united to help people left 
homeless by the temblor. Station employees joined in, carting supplies to 
people encamped in San Fernando Valley parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a family turned to the morning show hosts for help in getting their 
father off drugs. "This man came to the station with his wife and kids," 
Hidalgo recounts. "He said: 'I have lots of problems with my family. I came to 
promise you that I'll stop using drugs.' " The man checks in with the pair 
regularly to report his progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of KLAX's 40 employees possess a quasi-religious fervor about the 
station. Relentlessly upbeat and patient when accepting visitors, who arrive at 
all hours without appointments, employees willingly take the time to chat up a 
listener. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really are attempting to be brothers, hermanos de la communidad ," says 
Carlos Haro, assistant dean of UCLA's International Studies and Overseas 
Programs. Haro is writing about the evolution of banda and KLAX's sociocultural 
impact for an academic journal. "To think that no one thought about doing that 
sort of thing before. How extraordinary!" 
</P>
<P>
 THERE'S A STORY THAT KLAX owner Raul Alarcon Jr. loves to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before launching the new format, general manager Rodriguez was racking 
his brain for new, catchy call letters -- essential for grabbing listeners who 
already had a variety of Spanish stations to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon recounts: "(Rodriguez) walks into my office and says: 'What is the 
letter that anyone, even illiterate people, know how to sign? And what are the 
initials of the city in which we're broadcasting?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was born KLAX. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner continues: "I told him: 'That's genius! You've got to be kidding me. 
There's no other KLAX?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon soon learned that a TV station in Louisiana was using the call 
letters KLAX, and FCC regulations dictate that a station's name must be 
exclusive. Alarcon called the station's owner and asked how much he wanted for 
the letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy said: 'I know what you're up to, you'll take that station and it'll 
go to No. 1.' " Alarcon recalls. "I said: 'Mister, you're so off base.' But he 
was insistent. He wanted me to pay $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon negotiated down to $75,000 but was chided by his attorney, who 
advised: "You will never make that money back." But Alarcon said: "I gotta have 
those call letters." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon was in Paris when the ratings first revealed that the station had 
leaped to No. 1. His office forwarded a fax from the owner of the former KLAX. 
It read: "You see? I told you."

<P>
 Surprise! 
</P>
<P>
 This was the theme of the 1994 City Section 3-A Division baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing was more unexpected than Huntington Park's Cinderella season in which 
the Spartans left a legion of stunned teams and fans in its wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone looked past us," Huntington Park Coach Mark Chacon said. "This team 
played with more heart, drive and determination than other teams (I've 
coached)." 
</P>
<P>
 For his outstanding efforts this season, Chacon was named the City Times Coach 
of the Year, succeeding South Gate's Mike Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's Yamel Delgado was named Player of the Year, the second year in a row 
for a pitcher. South Gate's Alonzo Lopez won last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park finished the regular season in a tie with Bell and Garfield 
for the fourth-best record in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Huntington Park defeated fifth-seeded and 1993 runner-up Crenshaw, 
7-6, fourth-seeded Roosevelt, 5-1, and top-seeded Lincoln, 2-1, during its 
unpredictable march to the finals, in which Huntington Park lost to Franklin, 
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending City 3-A champion South Gate, which had been expected to make a 
return trip to Dodger Stadium this year, lost to eventual champion Franklin, 
7-3, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the 1994 City Times first team: 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Alcantar, South Gate -- The senior center fielder/pitcher was voted 
Southeastern Conference co-player of the year along with Roosevelt's Alex 
Rodriguez. Alcantar batted .450 with one home run and 19 RBIs. His slugging 
percentage was .683 and his on-base percentage was .522. Alcantar pitched eight 
games, going 5-2 with a 3.12 ERA. He struck out 49 batters in 49 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Castaneda, Lincoln -- The Northern League Player of the Year batted a 
spectacular .625 with three home runs and 30 RBIs. The junior shortstop will be 
the cornerstone of Lincoln's team next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamel Delgado, Bell -- The Eagle's right-handed ace was 4-1 in league play 
with a 0.90 ERA. The part-time shortstop was also impressive with the bat, 
hitting .494 on the season, with two home runs and 31 RBIs. The All-Eastern 
League senior also stole 21 bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Lico Erami, Lincoln -- Another All-Northern League player for the Tigers, 
Erami hit .477 with three home runs and 13 RBIs. The first baseman provided 
invaluable leadership this season as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Herrera, Wilson -- Herrera was selected to the All-Northern Conference 
first team with a .456 batting average. The powerful right-hander hit five home 
runs with 25 RBIs. Herrera also pitched for the Mules, with a record of 1-1, 
and had a personal-best 11 strikeouts in a victory over Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Loza, Bell Gardens -- Loza, who was named Almont League Most Valuable 
Player for the second consecutive year, also makes a return appearance on the 
first team. The senior center fielder batted .498 with 19 RBIs in the No. 3 
spot. Loza also pitched for the Lancers, going 7-1 with a 1.24 ERA and 48 
strikeouts. Loza stole 22 bases in 24 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike McNeely, Crenshaw -- One of the best defensive shortstops in the area, 
McNeely also gave the Cougars a lift on offense. The senior hit .382 with one 
home run and 22 RBIs. The All-Southern Pacific Conference performer stole 10 
bases and had 20 strikeouts in 22 1/3 innings as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Montenegro, South Gate -- The senior shortstop/catcher makes his second 
consecutive appearance on the City Times first team. Montenegro's true value to 
South Gate was the flexibility he added to Coach Mike Ryan's lineup. His .269 
average included 17 walks, four doubles, a triple and eight RBIs. Montenegro 
had a .658 slugging percentage and a .424 on-base percentage. As a pitcher, 
Montenegro was 4-0 with a 0.79 earned-run average. Montenegro struck out 31 
batters in 26 innings while giving up 17 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Moreno, Bell -- The junior right-hander makes the leap from last year's 
second team. Another member of the area's top pitching staff, Moreno was 7-1 
with a 0.89 ERA. Moreno pitched a team-high five complete games, surrendering 
21 hits in 43 innings. In the cleanup spot, Moreno hit .380 with two home runs 
and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley Rachels, Loyola -- Rachels, a member of last year's first team, 
admittedly didn't see the same pitches this season as last season, when he hit 
.493. Regardless, Rachels hit .424, drove in 15 runs and was walked 30 times. 
Rachels was a member of the All-Mission League first team and was named one of 
the nation's top prospects by Collegiate Baseball magazine. Rachels' university 
options include USC, Pepperdine and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Rodriguez, Roosevelt -- Rodriguez was a member of the second team last 
year with a .372 batting average but made the first team this year with a 
team-high .463 average. Rodriguez was the leader of Roosevelt's hit brigade, 
going three-for-three with three RBIs in a 9-5 win over City 3-A runner-up 
Huntington Park earlier this season. Rodriguez was named Southeastern 
Conference co-player of the year along with South Gate's Richard Alcantar. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Carlos Rodriguez, Roosevelt -- Rodriguez, an All-Eastern League 
selection, hit .439 with three home runs and 18 RBIs. Rodriguez also stole 16 
bases. 1994 Prep Baseball ALL-STARS Name: Michael McNeely

3-A DIVISION FINAL; HUNTINGTON PARK SEES TITLE SLIP AWAY; BASEBALL: ERRORS HURT 
THE SPARTANS IN 2-1 LOSS AT DODGER STADIUM, BUT THE UNDERDOGS MAKE IT TOUGH ON 
FRANKLIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Huntington Park High baseball players discovered what it is like to play at 
Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 To dress in a locker room that smells of liniment. 
</P>
<P>
 To have their names announced over a public address system. 
</P>
<P>
 And to dirty their uniforms with red brick clay from the infield. 
</P>
<P>
 For one day, the Spartans felt and played like Dodgers. They even made a 
couple of Dodger-size errors that cost them a 2-1 game against Franklin on 
Monday in the City Section 3-A Division finals. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Franklin's Oscar Cabrera drove in the winning run with a 
double to the left in the fifth inning. But the first and most crucial run came 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 With two outs, Franklin's Lorenso Marquez hit a slow grounder to shortstop 
Hugo Villagrana and beat the throw to first. "The second base umpire told me he 
thought he was out," Villagrana said. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Armando Matos made two consecutive errors, dropping the ball on 
a pick-off play and failing to catch a throw from Villagrana. The second error 
allowed Marquez to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit the wrong part of the glove and just bounced out," Matos said about 
the potential groundout. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Barojas singled and Franklin entered the top of the fifth one run richer 
at the expense of pitcher Mario Arambula (6-4). "I felt confident with every 
pitch I threw," the left-handed pitcher said. "We had our chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Matos made amends by driving in a run with a single, the Spartans' third 
consecutive hit to start the fifth. But Franklin pitcher Ricky Catano got the 
next three batters to snuff out the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 2-1, Huntington Park threatened again in the sixth. Juan Garcia 
singled and moved to second on Jaime Ornelas' sacrifice bunt. But Villagrana's 
single to right was not deep enough to score Garcia from second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to keep the momentum going and avoid the big out," Huntington Park 
Coach Mark Chacon said about holding Garcia at third. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big out turned out to be the one that Huntington Park let slip in the 
fourth. While many Spartans expressed their sorrow, Villagrana remained excited 
about his big league experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, man, it was the greatest feeling to be at Dodger Stadium," he said. "I 
would have had tears in my eyes if we had won. But I'm happy to be here."

HUNTINGTON PARK CAN'T QUITE SLAY THE FINAL GIANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a 2-1 loss to Franklin in the City Section 3-A Division Finals on 
Monday, the Huntington Park players were understandably upset. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of drooped heads and the sound of heavy sobbing surrounded the 
Spartans' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 But pitcher Mario Arambula, who had the most reason to feel downtrodden, was 
in surprisingly high spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Arambula not only suffered the loss in the championship game, but by the 
identical score that he lost to Franklin last year in the first round of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like I am having a flashback," said the senior left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a great feeling just being here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, it didn't appear as if Arambula's sentiments were shared by his 
teammates, but Coach Mark Chacon knew his squad had reason to be proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lincoln had more talent than most of the teams we've faced, but (in the 
playoffs) it's not who's the better team, it's who's the hottest or most 
consistent team," Chacon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team saw themselves as giant-killers." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park (15-11) finished the regular season tied with Bell and 
Garfield for fourth place in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans would have to defeat a No. 5 seed (Crenshaw), No. 4 seed 
(Roosevelt) and a No. 1 seed (Lincoln) to reach the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park used the one-game-at-a-time approach and, 10 days later, the 
team was playing at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park may have played the role of a modern-day David in the 
postseason, but Arambula performed more like a Goliath during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Arambula was 6-4 on the year, with a 1.67 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts on the mound earned him all-Southeastern Conference first team 
honors for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Arambula's importance to the team, however, was more than just an overpowering 
fastball or sharp curveball. 
</P>
<P>
 "My role was to be team leader and to take this team to a championship," said 
the four-year varsity starter, "The main key is teamwork, and I kept everyone 
playing as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Chacon attributes Huntington Park's success to Arambula's year-to-year 
improvement: "Mario has come a long way. He is a big reason why we are here. 
(Once he) gained control of his breaking ball, he started to mature as a 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 10 years since Huntington Park last appeared in the final -- the 
Spartans lost, 1-0, to Lincoln in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Huntington Park has been a fairly competitive team, making 
periodic playoff appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed this year would be no different as Huntington Park finished the 
season only two games above .500 and barely made the playoffs as the No. 12 
seed. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park may not have had the skill to dominate during the season, but 
they had one of the key ingredients necessary to winning in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not the most talented team I have coached, but the strength of this 
team was its heart."

GRANVILLE SURGES DOWN STRETCH TO WIN STATE 800 TITLE; TRACK: THE SOPHOMORE 
COMES FROM BEHIND TO BECOME BELL GARDENS HIGH'S FIRST-EVER STATE CHAMPION. 
OTHER TOP FINISHERS INCLUDE KEISHA GRIFFIS OF WASHINGTON, WHO PLACES THIRD IN 
300-METER LOW HURDLES. 
</P>

<P>
 Last year, Michael Granville became the first athlete from Bell Gardens High 
School to qualify for the State track and field meet as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he became the school's first state champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville won the 800 meters in 1 minute 49.82 seconds in the June 4 meet at 
Cerritos College, thrusting his arms at the finish after overtaking Vondre 
Armour of Bakersfield down the final straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Armour was second in 1:50.11 and Jessie Camp of Lakeside El Capitan was third 
in 1:52.14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so overwhelmed by emotion" after the victory, said Granville, who 
placed third in the 400 meters last year. "It was one of the good moments of my 
track career." 
</P>
<P>
 The performance was one of many outstanding efforts this season for the 
6-foot, 165-pound sophomore. Granville, 16, set national sophomore indoor 
records in the 500 yards and 800 meters and an outdoor 10th-grade record in the 
800. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Granville ran 1:48.98 in the Southern Section Division I final, the 
nation's fastest 800-meter time this season. In April, he clocked a 
nation-leading 46.65 in the 400 meters in the Mt. San Antonio College relays. 
He will compete June 19 in the 400 in the National Scholastic championships at 
North Carolina State and also plans to run in either the 200, 400 or 800 meters 
in the Junior Olympic National championships in Gainesville, Fla., in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to expand to some other races and try something different," Granville 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually a front-runner, Granville was forced to come up with an alternative 
plan at the state meet after Obea Moore of Pasadena Muir towed the field 
through a sizzling 51.9-second first 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, content to stay two seconds back at the halfway mark, caught Moore 
with 200 meters to go and ran side-by-side with Armour until Granville surged 
with 60 meters to go and pulled away for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not have been fluid if I forced the pace. I was going as hard as I 
could," Granville said. "My dad told me to watch out for someone going out 
fast. In a top-caliber race like that, you just try to stay in contention and 
make a statement in the last 200 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Keisha Griffis of Washington again established herself as the City Section's 
top 300-meter low hurdler. The two-time defending City champion was the 
section's top finisher in any event, placing third in her specialty in 43.72. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey's Leo Settle finished sixth in the 100 in 10.80 and third in the 200 in 
21.48. Settle joined Anthony Mabry, Jabulani Smith-Freeman and Rodrick Brown on 
the Dons' 400-meter relay team, which finished sixth in 41.96. 
</P>
<P>
 Settle and Mabry, along with Gene Shepard and Anthony Wheeler, qualified for 
the 1,600-meter relay final with the third-fastest qualifying time of 3:14.98 
in the preliminaries but could only manage sixth in the final at 3:17.02. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McElroy of Washington was seventh in the 200 in 22.20 and ran on the 
Generals' 400-meter relay team, which finished seventh in 42.40. City 
3,200-meter champion Humberto Sanchez of South Gate was 14th in a personal best 
9:21.29.

THE TIMES POLL; SOUTHLAND VIETNAMESE SUPPORT RENEWED TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Almost two decades after the fall of Saigon, most Vietnamese refugees and 
immigrants living in Southern California have made peace with the past, 
tempering their contempt for communism with support for renewed ties with their 
ancestral homeland, according to a new Los Angeles Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 This silent majority -- for years divided by bullhorn rhetoric and sometimes 
violent debate about relations with the Vietnamese Communist regime -- favors 
the establishment of full diplomatic relations with Hanoi, and approves of 
President Clinton's recent lifting of the 19-year-old trade embargo against the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey underscores the practical attitudes of Vietnamese immigrants, most 
of whom believe that their struggling relatives left behind in Southeast Asia 
could benefit from a thawing in relations between the United States and 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of Southern California's Vietnamese immigrants -- 54% -- 
support the ending of the trade embargo, which had been imposed on the entire 
country when South Vietnam fell to the Communists in 1975. Younger adults are 
more likely to have a favorable view of links with old enemies, but support for 
the embargo's end is even shared by almost half of their elders. And 54% of 
those surveyed want to push even further, supporting full diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times telephone poll of 861 Vietnamese residents in Southern California 
was conducted from March 28 through April 19, roughly two months after Clinton 
announced that he was ending the embargo. The poll has a sampling error of plus 
or minus four percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many people who don't dare to stand up to support renewing ties 
with Vietnam because we'd be called traitors, betrayers," said Bau Nguyen, a 
33-year-old machinist from Garden Grove. "But in reality there has been no 
nation that has successfully beaten communism. Communism, we have seen, 
destroys itself. So why not normalize relations with Communist Vietnam and help 
people inside fight against communism?" 
</P>
<P>
 The poll provides a snapshot of life in the immigrant Vietnamese community, 
showing that most are relatively satisfied with life in Southern California, 
where they can always find a familiar taste of home in the pho soup shops and 
coffeehouses of Little Saigon in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a surprising one-third of those surveyed said they would forsake the 
good life in California and return to their native country if the present 
Communist regime were ousted through bullets or ballots and replaced with a 
democratic government. The number of older Vietnamese residents wishing to go 
is even higher, with 47% of those age 50 or older saying they would return to 
live in Vietnam permanently if a democratic government were in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Thang Dao, 56, sums up his wistful view with a Vietnamese expression that is 
the equivalent of the old saying "home sweet home." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to go home," he said, "to swim in our pond. Though clear or murky, 
the home pond is preferred." 
</P>
<P>
 But by large margins, Vietnamese immigrants view their adopted home here 
positively, saying they have fared generally well in terms of housing, job 
opportunities, education and social acceptance. Most say they have been largely 
undisturbed by prejudice and discrimination, and the largest group says an 
inadequate command of English remains the biggest hurdle for their success in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Even brand-new immigrants who have mastered little English and are struggling 
to survive on low-wage jobs are largely satisfied with the conditions they have 
found here. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest wave of Vietnamese immigrants, those who have come in the last five 
years, are more likely to have been tugged here by family ties instead of 
pushed by political repression -- a reversal of previous trends. And the poll 
found that another shift has also taken place: Typically, Vietnamese newcomers 
arriving here in the last five years are young, unmarried women, as opposed to 
the military men with families who made up a large part of the first wave of 
refugees, and the predominantly male second wave of boat people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When most people came by boat, 75% of immigrants were men. Women were afraid 
of the rough boat trip with the pirates and all that. But it's different now. 
No one has to go by boat anymore because everyone is flying over through 
immigrant programs," said Loc Nguyen, a counselor who sees an even mix of men 
and women at the refugee center run by the Vietnamese Community of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers are benefiting from the efforts of earlier pioneers who fled Vietnam 
aboard barges and battleships on April 30, 1975, the date still marked annually 
in the ethnic enclaves of Westminster and Garden Grove as the "Day of Anguish." 
</P>
<P>
 It is these pioneers -- and the bigger wave that followed them out of Vietnam 
on rickety fishing boats -- who have transformed Westminster from a suburban 
outpost of flower warehouses and strawberry fields into a thriving commercial 
capital of tea shops, restaurants and gleaming new shopping strips that draw 
Vietnamese customers from San Jose to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon bears little resemblance to the crowded and frantic original -- 
which officially discarded its name for Ho Chi Minh City. But it still gives a 
sense of identity and community to a people who confess they largely don't know 
or aren't sure who their leaders are. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half of those surveyed call Little Saigon the most important center for 
the Vietnamese community's business, cultural and social life. And a wider 
group -- 70% -- considers the area a vital part of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Tran, 29, a new law school graduate and former legislative aide, still 
feels a wave of nostalgia when he drives past the olive green exit signs for 
Little Saigon on the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It meant so much to me to see the word Saigon again," Tran said. "It's like 
finding one's own identity when one has lost it in Vietnam. As you know, the 
name Saigon has been wiped out in Vietnam, but here we were able to resurrect 
it. It's only in America where this Little Saigon has appeared." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no markers for the path to political power. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those surveyed revealed that their community is afflicted with a 
severe leadership vacuum. Asked to name a Vietnamese leader, 88% were stumped. 
Only 5% picked Tony Lam, a restaurant owner and Westminster city councilman who 
is thought to be the only Vietnamese American elected official in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are relatively unaffected by the infighting and protests that have 
divided the community's leaders and groups over the years, ranking factionalism 
as a problem far behind crime, the economy and other social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a little over a year ago that the head of the Vietnamese Chamber 
of Commerce sported a bulletproof vest, strolled with armed bodyguards and 
ignored the insults and curses shouted by demonstrators outside his office. 
</P>
<P>
 For publicly supporting renewed ties to Vietnam, chamber President Co Pham 
received death threats, endured demonstrations and felt the need to take out a 
full-page advertisement in a Vietnamese language newspaper to deny rumors that 
he was a Communist sympathizer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this survey will prove once and for all that our stance and our 
visions are correct," said Pham, a doctor. "To me, now is a time to heal, and 
not a time to dig into the wounds of the past. And the way to heal is to work 
toward better relations with Vietnam so that the Vietnamese, abroad and at 
home, can prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the U.S. will establish a liaison office in Vietnam," Pham added, "I 
want to advise my compatriots that it's time to wake up and to work together 
and strengthen our community and not try to break it apart with fruitless 
protests."

 The passionate rhetoric of Little Saigon protesters and demonstrators is 
clearly at odds with the moderate views of the majority of Vietnamese 
immigrants, who generally have gone about the business of surviving instead of 
competing with the voices magnified by bullhorns. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. trade embargo had been in place against North Vietnam since 1965, and 
was extended to cover all of Vietnam when the south was overrun in 1975. For 
decades, the issue was a divisive one among the leaders and community activists 
within Little Saigon, who considered it the litmus test of anti-communism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll showed that support for lifting the trade embargo outweighed 
opposition in every major demographic group, including older Vietnamese, 
longtime U.S. residents and new immigrants. Almost half of those surveyed said 
the embargo's end could promote democracy and human rights in Vietnam, while 
one in six thought it might have little impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "This breathes new life into the country. The people will have more 
opportunities to get jobs and better lives," said a 39-year-old Fullerton 
electronic engineer who asked that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineer said he has long maintained silence about his views for fear of 
alienating Vietnamese veterans, or even worse -- inviting insults and 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we say what's in our heart and head, we'd be branded Communist 
sympathizers. And once you get that reputation, there's no way you can reverse 
that belief," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineer reflects the outlook of the younger generation, which typically 
takes a more tolerant and practical view of the Hanoi regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the younger people polled -- along with a majority of the 
affluent middle class and longtime immigrants who came here almost 15 years ago 
-- favor establishing full diplomatic relations with Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 But that support has clear limits. Most Vietnamese immigrants say that it will 
not affect them personally, adding that it is very unlikely they will do 
business in Vietnam now that the embargo has been lifted. Not surprisingly, 
their attention is more focused on their life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a life they consider largely satisfying. They like American culture and 
many are trying assiduously to fit in by becoming citizens and learning 
English, and are registering to vote at rates higher than an earlier Times Poll 
found among their Korean counterparts. Nearly half of those surveyed are 
citizens, and among those who are not, more than 80% plan to apply for 
citizenship.

 San Diego computer programmer Dung Le said his lifestyle in the United States 
has turned out to be better than anything he could have dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst of days here are better than the best of days there. No matter how 
bad the economy here is -- and it has been pretty bad -- nothing will ever 
compare to the poverty that Vietnamese people face there," said Le, 27, a 
naturalized U.S. citizen who fled Vietnam in a boat in the second wave of 
immigration in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The worries and concerns of Vietnamese residents are not all that much 
different from those of other Southern Californians. At the top of their list 
of community problems is crime and gangs, followed by economic issues. And 
substantially fewer Vietnamese residents call their personal finances secure 
today than did all Southern Californians a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When Denny Dang was a student at the Agriculture Institute of Saigon in the 
early 1970s, he dreamed of moving here to find immeasurable riches and thien 
duong -- nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I arrived in America," said Dang, 44, of Alhambra, "I quickly 
learned that I dreamed too high, and that was my fault for believing everything 
I heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Since settling here in 1982 he has held a collection of jobs that included 
stints with the post office and a health care agency. For the last two months 
he has been unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thien duong didn't happen, obviously," he said, "but there are no 
regrets. Life here is better than it would have been in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a clear majority of the Vietnamese say their lives have turned out 
better than they had expected when they arrived in the United States. How the 
Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 861 adult Vietnamese residents of Los Angeles, 
Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties by telephone 
from March 28 through April 19, 1994. The questions were developed in 
consultation with Duong Pham, a visiting lecturer at UC Irvine and UCLA, and 
Khao Luu, president of the Assn. of Former Vietnamese Educators Overseas. The 
interviewing was conducted in Vietnamese and English by Vietnamese American 
interviewers at Interviewing Services of America Inc. of Van Nuys. A list of 
Vietnamese surnames was used to draw the samples from phone directories in the 
six counties. Results were adjusted slightly so that the sample conforms with 
census information about sex, age and education. Vietnamese residents of Orange 
County were oversampled and a total of 502 interviews were conducted there; 359 
were conducted in the other five counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Southern California results are cited, the Orange County sample is 
weighted to its proper proportion in the sample. The margin of sampling error 
for the entire sample is plus or minus 4 percentage points. For the Orange 
County sample, the error is plus or minus 5 percentage points; for the rest of 
the region it is plus or minus 7 points. The sampling error for other subgroups 
may vary. In addition to sampling error, poll results can be affected by other 
factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented. Additionally, surname samples of this type do not allow for the 
sampling of people with unlisted telephone numbers and Vietnamese residents who 
do not have Vietnamese surnames. Los Angeles Times Poll: Vietnamese Back

 Although the Vietnamese immigrant community in Southern California still takes 
a dim view of the Communist government in their homeland, they support 
President Clinton's lifting of the trade embargo and the idea that Washington 
should extend full diplomatic relations to Hanoi. They feel these steps will 
promote democracy and the economic well-being of the friends and relatives they 
left behind.

CLINTON TIES TO TYSON SCION STILL DRAWING CRITICS' FIRE; POLITICS: SOME ALLEGE 
ARKANSAN GOT SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM AGRICULTURE, COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS. HE 
DENIES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is an unlikely looking millionaire kingmaker -- a balding, impish man whose 
trademark khaki work uniform belies his wealth and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Donald Tyson, who succeeded in building his father's small poultry 
business into a multimillion-dollar food-processing empire, has been widely 
portrayed as a driving force behind the political ascendancy of Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, during the 1992 presidential campaign, Texas billionaire and 
independent candidate Ross Perot dubbed then-Gov. Clinton "chicken man" because 
of his close relationship to Tyson and to Arkansas' poultry industry. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton himself drew attention to the association when he acknowledged to 
a campaign audience that he had sacrificed the environment in Arkansas to 
create more jobs for the state's poultry farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the alliance between these two men has become a cause celebre once again. 
Critics of the President contend that a relationship that benefited both men 
during their days together in Arkansas still provides mutual rewards today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agriculture Department's failure to impose tougher standards on Tyson 
Foods Inc. and other poultry processors has prompted widespread criticism -- as 
well as a Justice Department inquiry. And the Commerce Department has been 
accused of rewriting regulations to benefit Tyson Foods' fishing interests in 
the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore Tyson -- acting through his lawyer, James Blair -- is now said by 
critics to have played a role in Hillary Rodham Clinton's recently disclosed 
commodities trading profits during the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 These allegations remain unproven -- and some stories circulating about Tyson 
and Clinton are plainly false -- but they demonstrate the way in which the 
President continues to be dogged by questions over favored relationships with 
his old friends in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 While such accusations can haunt any President, they have been particularly 
troublesome for Clinton -- in part because he pledged that his White House 
would be free from the cronyism of presidencies past. In addition, the 
inherently close-knit nature of Arkansas' political and financial elite seems 
to fuel the suspicions of Clinton's critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson, a liberal Democrat, freely acknowledges that he considers the President 
an old friend and that he has generously supported Clinton's political career 
with campaign contributions and other assistance over the years. But he 
staunchly denies that the relationship has ever gone beyond that of patron and 
public servant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do business in Arkansas, you need to know who the people who are 
running the government are," Tyson said in an interview. "We never got anything 
we didn't deserve because of who we are -- a business leader in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson made it clear he was not amused by a steady drumbeat of unflattering 
news reports questioning the motives behind his friendship with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 His aides point to many fictitious stories that have found their way into the 
press in recent months -- reports that Hillary Clinton once served on the Tyson 
Foods Board of Directors, that Tyson slept at the White House on the night of 
the President's inauguration, that Tyson hosted a dinner for the Clintons at an 
exclusive restaurant in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am quickly growing weary of the insinuations and allegations that the 
company bearing my family name is in some insidious way benefiting as a result 
of the fact that the former governor of Arkansas now resides at 1600 
Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington," Tyson recently wrote to several newspaper 
editors. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Administration officials have been quick to deny the allegations. 
White House aide John Podesta scoffed at the idea of favoritism toward Tyson, 
and Agriculture Department officials have condemned as "faulty" suggestions 
that the Tyson-Clinton connection has in any way influenced the government's 
poultry inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if their relationship is nothing more than one of mutual admiration, it 
would run counter to local Arkansas lore. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry G. Patterson, an Arkansas state trooper and former bodyguard to Clinton, 
says he remembers that the then-governor once told him if Tyson rendered a 
favor, the poultry scion would always expect a favor in return. "There is a 
dark side to Don Tyson," Patterson recalled Clinton saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there any doubt among locals here that Tyson has played an important 
role in Clinton's political success. The evidence includes $18,500 in campaign 
contributions from Tyson Foods executives to Clinton's 1992 campaign, as well 
as generous contributions to other Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Greenwood, a local Republican businessman, said he remembers 
encountering Tyson, Blair and another man in a local restaurant in the early 
1980s. Even then, he said, they were plotting to get Clinton elected President. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who put Bill Clinton in the White House is Don Tyson," Greenwood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Tyson's reputation as a high-energy, risk-taking agribusinessman is 
responsible for generating such intense interest in his relationship with the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 At 64, Tyson lives an oddly hybrid daily existence that combines the rustic 
simplicity of country life with a swirl of sophisticated international business 
deals and a standard of personal luxury unknown to most residents in Arkansas' 
chicken-producing region. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbed in Tyson Foods' standard-issue khaki uniform with "Don" embroidered 
over the breast pocket, he spends his workdays in an exceptionally elegant 
corporate office that is a replica of the White House Oval Office he first 
visited during the Jimmy Carter Administration. Tyson still visits his old 
friends at the local pool hall, even though he clearly prefers deep-sea fishing 
on his 63-foot yacht. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Democratic politics first brought Tyson and Clinton together in the 
early 1970s, when the future President was a young teacher at the University of 
Arkansas Law School in Fayetteville. That was shortly after Tyson's parents 
were killed in a car crash, leaving him the family business. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about that same time that Clinton made friends with Blair, now Tyson 
Foods' general counsel and the man who helped Hillary Clinton make a $100,000 
profit in commodities trading on an investment of just $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tyson-Clinton relationship has not been without its ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton had Tyson's support when he first became governor in 1979, 
the two men had a falling out shortly thereafter over one of the hottest local 
issues of the day: truck weights. In 1980, Tyson supported Clinton's successful 
GOP opponent, Frank White, because the Democrat had opposed the poultry 
industry's campaign to raise the legal truck weight in the state to 80,000 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 White was unable to keep his promise to raise truck weights, however. But in 
1983, after being returned to the governor's mansion without Tyson's support, 
Clinton signed a bill raising the limit to 80,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton was governor of Arkansas, Tyson Foods flourished. Like other 
poultry processors, it enjoyed a variety of state tax advantages, such as the 
"enterprise zone" tax credits enacted into law by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists charge that Clinton stood idly by as runoff from Tyson 
Foods' poultry operations contaminated the region's streams and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when Clinton sought to put more environmentalists on the state 
pollution control commission in 1991, Tyson objected loudly and the matter 
ended in a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Tom McKinney, leader of the local Sierra Club, praises Tyson 
Foods for supporting efforts to eliminate pollution from chicken litter and 
other remnants of the poultry industry. In addition, records of the state 
Department of Pollution Control and Ecology show that the Clinton 
Administration frequently held Tyson Foods accountable for violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Always a matter of gossip in Arkansas, the Tyson-Clinton alliance has drawn 
even more intense scrutiny since the governor became President. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the U.S. Agriculture Department has been accused of singling 
out the beef industry for stepped-up inspections while going easy on the 
poultry processors. The complaints came primarily from meat producers, who at 
the time were being blamed for an outbreak of food poisoning in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 One former Agriculture Department official, H. Russell Cross, told The Times 
earlier this year that Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy acted in 1993 to delay 
the development of a tougher standard for fecal contamination of poultry. 
Meanwhile, Espy created the appearance of a conflict of interest by visiting 
Tyson Foods headquarters here and attending a Dallas Cowboys football game in 
the company of Don Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Justice Department officials recently ordered an FBI probe of Espy's 
actions. But Espy told the FBI that he had reimbursed Tyson Foods for his 
lodging, transportation and football game ticket, and Justice Department 
officials seem inclined to drop the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Agriculture Department officials noted that Espy in March 
promulgated a tougher standard for poultry inspections. Just last year, 14 of 
Tyson Foods' 66 plants were targeted for unannounced reviews, and stringent 
enforcement measures were imposed at two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the Commerce Department has been accused of acting at Tyson's behest 
in the 1993 allocation of the multimillion-dollar Pacific whiting catch. Tyson 
Foods had an interest in the decision because it owns Seattle-based Arctic 
Alaska Fisheries Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Arctic Alaska's competitors charged that Tyson Foods was responsible for 
persuading the Commerce Department to allocate 70% of the catch to factory 
trawlers and only 30% to shore-based processing plants, reversing the 
recommendation of regional authorities. At the time, it was assumed this 
decision benefited Arctic Alaska's factory trawler fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a bald-faced lie, and the people who are spreading it know it's a 
lie," said Tyson Foods public relations spokesman Archie Schaffer III. "We did 
not benefit from that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the decision actually harmed Tyson Foods because Arctic Alaska runs a 
shore-based processing plant as well as factory trawlers. He said Arctic Alaska 
was unprepared for the last-minute reversal and did not have enough trawlers in 
the area to take advantage of the higher allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's successful commodities trades are an issue closer 
to home for Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran commodities traders in the Springdale area were upset when they read 
in the newspapers several months ago that while trading without sufficient cash 
in her account, she made a $100,000 profit. These folks grew even more 
suspicious when it was learned that she had the help of Tyson's lawyer, Blair, 
and Robert (Red) Bone, a good friend and former employee of Tyson Foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone, who at the time of Hillary Clinton's trades was running the Springdale 
office of a Chicago-based brokerage, Refco Inc., was known as a broker who 
protected favored customers from losses by allocating successful trades to 
their accounts. At about the same time that the then-governor's wife was making 
a big profit in 1979, the rest of Bone's customers were on the verge of losing 
their shirts in a sinking cattle market. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as James B. McDougal tried to enrich the Clintons by making them partners 
in the Whitewater Development Corp., critics charge, Tyson -- acting through 
Blair and Bone -- had assisted Hillary Clinton in making her successful trades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don Tyson must have guaranteed her trades," said Greenwood, one of the 
traders who lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone and Tyson go way back. Bone got his start in commodities by doing hedge 
trading for Tyson Foods. In 1972, when Bone and Tyson were charged by the 
government with illegally trying to corner the egg market, Bone took the blame 
and left Tyson Foods to become a full-time commodities broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the two men are still friends, and Tyson even loaned Bone money -- 
accepting a huge diamond ring as collateral -- when the trader lost his job 
with Refco after the cattle futures market went bust in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Like others, Blair lost millions of dollars trading cattle futures with Bone 
in 1979. But unlike any of the other losing traders, he was reimbursed by 
Refco. Admittedly jealous of Blair's good fortune, Greenwood and other 
disgruntled traders see it as further evidence that Tyson's friends -- 
including Hillary Clinton -- were being protected from risk by Bone. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair strongly rejects these charges -- calling Greenwood "a liar." Speaking 
for the First Lady, Podesta said: "I don't think there is any evidence of that; 
it's pulled out of whole cloth." Bone could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson rebuts the charges by noting that neither he nor his company ever traded 
cattle futures. In addition, he said, he didn't meet Hillary Clinton until the 
mid-1980s and was unaware of her commodities trading until it came to light 
five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Greenwood and others see the outline of a conspiracy involving Tyson, 
Bone, Blair and Hillary Clinton, their defenders see nothing more than sheer 
coincidence. After all, they note, this is rural Arkansas, where it seems 
everyone knows everyone else -- especially the Clintons and Don Tyson.

LAPD BEEFS UP VENICE PATROLS TO HALT GANG WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The streets of Venice swarmed with police officers Saturday, providing at 
least a temporary respite in a bloodthirsty gang war that is killing bystanders 
and changing the rhythm of life in the funky beach community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got what I would call an army of officers deployed," said Capt. Richard 
LeGarra, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division. "We 
look at this as a public emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 LeGarra said that about 100 extra police officers would be at work in Venice 
through the weekend -- nearly five times the normal complement on the busiest 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Two killings Friday morning prompted the increased police deployment and were 
the latest in a furious and complex gang war that has killed at least 17 people 
since it erupted last fall. The attacks have pitted black and Latino gangs 
against each other and, according to police intelligence reports, may be fueled 
in part by the Mexican Mafia, which is said to be trying to seize control of 
the neighborhood drug trade from black gangs and supplying Latino gangs with 
some of their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although centered in the Oakwood section of Venice -- a mile-square 
neighborhood that is home to more homicides than any other area on the Westside 
-- the war has affected the entire community, with attacks reported in other 
parts of Venice and in neighboring Mar Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 As the violence has spread, it has cast a specter of fear across much of 
Venice -- an eclectic community that bristles with an energetic mix of artists 
and householders, tourists and weightlifters, beach bums and gourmets, rich and 
poor. In some neighborhoods, people who once went to the market at night now do 
their shopping during daylight, and residents who visited friends in the 
evenings now use the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night, no one goes out," Domitilo Aguayo, 47, said Saturday as he watched 
his two young sons play baseball in a park. "They're shooting at anyone, not 
necessarily gang members. That's new. If you have the wrong haircut, they mow 
you down. You live in fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Clarke Martin, 32, a maintenance worker who used to live in Oakwood, 
said he now steers clear of his old neighborhood and its increasingly violent 
racial tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the black and brown battles, I just try to stay out of the way," Martin 
said. "It seems like the gangs are all over the place now." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the people shot in the attacks were a UCLA nurse and a man sitting in 
his car while taking his children to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason or rationale for some of these, at least that we've been 
able to determine," LeGarra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent randomness of some attacks, as well as the geographic spread of 
the violence, has projected fear into art galleries, popular restaurants and 
the beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents say they have taken to living in the back rooms of their homes 
so they will be protected from any bullets that might be fired from a passing 
automobile. Others say they have altered their routes to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worried about it coming to work today," said Jan Gillen, 36, assistant to 
the director of the Bobbie Greenfield Fine Art Gallery in a trendy section of 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillen said she chose a different route to work Saturday so she would not pass 
anywhere near Oakwood. "Flying bullets hit anyone," she added, "regardless of 
color." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenfield said the recent violence has escalated to the point that it has 
become impossible to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a new experience," she said. "You know, the perception of danger. We 
are all going through this for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to at least temporarily restore the peace, the LAPD assigned more 
than 100 extra officers to patrol Venice over the weekend focusing their 
attention on potential hot spots such as Oakwood and Mar Vista and stretches 
along the beach where large crowds of summer visitors regularly descend. 
Special gang units and crime suppression details known as "mobile field forces" 
were dispatched. Normal patrol forces were increased as well. 
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, dozens of officers were patrolling the boardwalk, 
sometimes four abreast, amid the usual collection of jugglers, musicians and 
other assorted street performers. Police trucks, black-and-whites and unmarked 
police cars were cruising the area. Police reported little trouble through the 
busy afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the usual crowd," said Officer Larry Nichols, watching the thick 
boardwalk crowds as he stood next to three parked police cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 LeGarra said officers were working 10-hour days and that some days off had 
been canceled. As the officers prepared to hit the streets Saturday morning, 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents the area and who was a victim of a 
former gang member's violent attack in 1987, attended their roll call to thank 
them for putting in the extra time. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, many of them frightened and weary from eight months of gang 
battles, welcomed the influx of officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their presence makes a difference," said Pearl White, 74, an Oakwood resident 
who has lobbied the police and City Council for years. "The people here are 
overjoyed. Now if they'd just stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Boardwalk merchant Lucas Silva, 34, echoed White's comments, saying he was 
glad for the extra police. But he added that he would have preferred that the 
LAPD send more officers and that it commit them for a longer stay. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, Silva sat on a stool outside his Universal Art framing store. But 
with sundown approaching, he said he planned to move inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 4 o'clock, I don't sit outside," he said. "A bullet can hit you 
anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 LeGarra conceded that the deployment was only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the area saturated right now," he said. "But obviously, we can't 
keep that up forever." 
</P>
<P>
 While patrol officers pounded the pavement, gang detectives and homicide 
investigators from the Pacific Division tried to ferret out clues in the most 
recent killings. Two teen-agers were slain and two others were wounded Friday 
morning. The teen-agers, all Latino students at Dorsey High School, were not 
believed to be gang members. Three suspects, all of them black, were being 
sought, and police would not comment on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the extra investigators, police concede that they still do not fully 
understand the reasons for the recent rash of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence reports gathered by the Oakwood Task Force, a special unit 
assigned to combat the gang violence, suggest that a web of territorial 
disputes, a quest for control of the local drug trade and racial tension all 
have contributed to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those reports, the gang tension began when a Latino gang known as 
the Culver City Boys took over drug trafficking in the Mar Vista area from the 
Shoreline Crips, a black gang. Tensions grew and erupted into warfare, those 
reports add, after the Culver City Boys and V-13, another Latino gang, struck a 
truce in the Oakwood area and began to gather there, a development that angered 
members of the Shoreline Crips. 
</P>
<P>
 What has followed has been a deadly cycle of violence and retaliation, much of 
it racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a black who shoots a Hispanic," LeGarra said. "When that happens, 
you can be sure you'll have a Hispanic shoot a black. It goes on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 Fed up with the violence, Oakwood residents have banded in an attempt to get 
police and city officials to devote more resources to fighting crime in their 
neighborhood. Many in the community have rallied behind the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you love a place like we love it over here, you can't help but be involved 
in it," said White, who has lived in Oakwood since 1945. "And we love it over 
here. We don't have any money, but we have one thing: We have pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, about 40 Oakwood residents appeared before the Los Angeles Police 
Commission, and commission President Gary Greenebaum has been meeting with 
residents and police commanders in a search for a lasting solution to the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Greenebaum is hopeful that police can make a difference, he admits 
that real progress has been difficult to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody says something's got to change, something's got to give," he said. 
"I just don't know what it's going to be."

CRITICS SEE FOREIGN TIES AS A LEASH AROUND U.S. NECK; SOVEREIGNTY: IN A 
FAMILIAR DEBATE, THE WHITE HOUSE IS ACCUSED OF GIVING TOO MUCH CONTROL TO OTHER 
NATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The ghost of Henry Cabot Lodge is stalking President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-five years ago, in the aftermath of World War I, Sen. Lodge 
successfully led the fight against President Woodrow Wilson's proposed League 
of Nations, arguing that it would give other countries too much power over U.S. 
policy on trade, immigration and committing troops to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoes of the argument rang through Congress last week, where a shifting 
amalgam of conservatives and liberals accused Clinton of giving international 
institutions like the United Nations, the successor of the League of Nations, 
too much influence over U.S. policy -- not only abroad but at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge that Clinton is ceding control over American affairs to 
international bureaucracies -- or put another way, compromising the nation's 
sovereignty -- is now opening a debate about America's role in the world in two 
key arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 On one front, Clinton is facing a phalanx of critics -- led by many of the 
Republicans likely to seek the party's presidential nomination in 1996 but also 
including some Democrats -- who want to diminish U.S. reliance on the United 
Nations and pursue a more independent course of action in Bosnia, North Korea 
and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On a second front, Clinton is trying to push a new world trade treaty through 
Congress over the objections of critics who say the pact would give other 
nations power to undermine a vast array of U.S. environmental and worker-safety 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 These debates cut to central choices about how America pursues its 
international objectives in the post-Cold War era. The Administration -- 
believing that the demise of the Cold War rivalry has made possible 
international cooperation on an unprecedented scale -- has generally sought to 
increase the power of multilateral institutions such as U.N. peacekeeping 
operations and the world trade organization. Their argument is that coordinated 
multinational action is the best way to deal with economic and security 
problems around the globe -- particularly at a time when the United States 
cannot afford to shoulder all burdens by itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have faced an intense backlash -- and have already been forced to 
retreat on some fronts -- by critics who complain that relying so heavily on 
the U.N. and other international institutions has limited America's freedom to 
maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing that this staunchly internationalist vision of what the world 
should become has a great many holes in it," said Alan Tonelson, research 
director at the Economic Strategy Institution in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said Clinton is merely pursuing the cooperation 
necessary in an increasingly interdependent world. They flatly reject the 
contention that he is reducing U.S. freedom to act unilaterally -- either in 
foreign or economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a new argument in American politics," said U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor. "It comes up historically with any international 
agreement America has ever entered of any note." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the fear that national leaders will compromise U.S. sovereignty to 
international institutions has been a steady background hum in American 
politics throughout this century, particularly among conservatives fearful of 
anything that looks like "world government." 
</P>
<P>
 Those concerns played critical roles in the Senate decisions to reject 
American participation in the League of Nations after World War I and the 
International Trade Organization after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most of the last 40 years, these apprehensions have been confined 
largely to an extremist fringe, such as the handful of conservatives who 
blocked U.S. adoption of a treaty on genocide for almost four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these arguments are being propelled back toward center stage -- partly by 
the GOP search for new lines of attack on Clinton but also by changes in the 
international environment. Beyond the partisan dimensions, Tonelson noted, 
these debates have been sharpened by two powerful trends: the increased 
reliance on U.N. peacekeeping forces made possible by the end of the superpower 
rivalry, and the growing demands for new rules and institutions to run the 
integrating global economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In trade, the crux of concern about eroding sovereignty is the mechanism for 
settling international economic disputes. Under existing trade laws, countries 
can challenge other nations' domestic economic or regulatory rules as unfair 
trade practices by bringing cases before panels authorized by the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the agreement that sets worldwide trading 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Using that process, for instance, Mexico and the European Union have won 
judgments condemning the U.S. ban on tuna caught with nets that imperil 
dolphins. Another GATT panel is reportedly nearing a decision on a European 
case charging that U.S. fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles penalize 
European manufacturers, such as Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing procedures have a huge loophole: Under current GATT rules, the 
country that loses a decision can block the implementation of sanctions to 
enforce it. But the new GATT treaty -- which Congress must still approve -- 
closed that escape hatch and denied a nation the ability to block rulings 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 As Administration officials quickly pointed out, that does not mean that the 
new World Trade Organization created in the treaty can order the United States 
to change a law that it considers in violation of international trade rules, 
such as the tuna ban. But it does mean that the country challenging the law 
will be legally authorized to impose sanctions or tariffs on U.S. products if 
Congress does not change the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said this new mandatory system is in U.S. interests because American 
firms are more often plaintiffs than defendants in such trade disputes. 
Congress, he noted, directed the negotiators to produce a tougher system for 
enforcing decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use the dispute settlement in the GATT more than any other country on 
Earth," he said. "We were frustrated by the European Community (now the EU) 
especially in the '80s, time after time, by their blocking dispute-settlement 
rulings." 
</P>
<P>
 But consumer activist Ralph Nader and other critics -- who aired their 
critiques at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing Friday -- worry that the 
mandatory system will provide a new avenue for domestic special interests, 
working in concert with foreign countries, to challenge environmental or 
occupational-health laws as unfair trade practices. Faced with the prospect of 
sanctions, he said, Congress will be under enormous pressure to change 
offending statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Treaty supporters insisted that Nader overstated the risk of the new trade 
organization ruling against U.S. laws. But they acknowledged that some 
reversals may be the price of compelling others to abide by decisions that go 
against them. "It would be disingenuous to suggest that a system that benefits 
you as a plaintiff would have no consequences as a defendant," said one senior 
Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these concerns, Congress is likely to approve the new trade order. But 
it may not sit still for too many international judgments that challenge U.S. 
laws, noted an aide to one senior Democrat who supports the treaty. "If what we 
see as a result of the WTO is a cascade of filings, the system is going to 
fail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar balancing between the desire for international cooperation and 
unfettered freedom of action runs through the debate over sovereignty in 
security affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Vietnam War, U.S. leaders have regularly demanded greater 
burden-sharing from our allies. But under Clinton, the issue has flipped from 
concerns that American allies were not doing enough to fear that they have 
moved into the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In what appears certain to be a central count of the GOP case in 1996, 
Republicans now routinely charge that Clinton has neutered U.S. foreign policy 
by only acting through the United Nations and with the approval of our allies. 
"It has become an excuse for not acting," said Jack Kemp, a former Cabinet 
member under President George Bush and possible Republican presidential 
contender in 1996. "You can say: 'We would have done something, but we couldn't 
get the French or the British to go along at the U.N.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore inadvertently provided the critics with a powerful 
example when he traveled to Marrakech, Morocco, in April for the signing of the 
new world trade agreement. Gore appeared hours after U.S. planes enforcing an 
allied "no fly" zone over northern Iraq accidentally shot down two U.S. 
helicopters, killing 15 Americans and 11 foreign officials. "I want to extend 
condolences," Gore said, "to the families of those who died in the service of 
the United Nations." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, in a tone of enthusiastic disdain, House Minority Leader Robert 
H. Michel (R-Ill.) threw those words back at the Administration. "When our men 
and women are killed on the battlefield," he declared during debate on a 
measure to bar U.S. forces from serving under U.N. commanders, "they do not die 
in the service of the United Nations. They die in the service of the United 
States of America." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear that Clinton has excessively deferred to the United Nations drove 
Thursday's stunning House vote calling on the Administration to unilaterally 
breach the U.N. arms embargo barring aid to the Bosnian Muslims. Similar 
concerns also powered the GOP amendment to bar U.S. forces from serving under 
foreign commanders in U.N. operations. 
</P>
<P>
 That amendment -- like an earlier Senate Republican effort -- failed on a 
party line vote. But those clear expressions of congressional dissatisfaction 
-- reinforced by the disillusionment that followed the ill-fated U.S.-led 
operation in Somalia -- have already deflated the Administration's enthusiasm 
for participating in multinational U.N. peacekeeping operations, once touted by 
Clinton as a key to American engagement with the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As a candidate, Clinton called for a dramatic expansion of U.N. authority, 
suggesting a standing multinational rapid-deployment force that could be used 
for peacekeeping, "standing guard at the borders of countries threatened by 
aggression" and preventing "violence against civilian populations. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That expansive vision of an independent U.N. force -- one that many liberals 
have harbored for decades -- "was dumped on day one" after Clinton took office, 
said one Administration official. "The first meeting that was held on 
peacekeeping (policy) everybody said: 'That's unrealistic, let's put that on 
the back burner.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Administration put out a presidential directive on 
peacekeeping last May, it sharply limited U.S. participation in U.N. military 
operations -- and the circumstances when U.S. forces taking part in such 
operations could serve under foreign commanders. Those guidelines are so 
restrictive that other nations now largely blame American reluctance for 
delaying dispatch of a U.N. peacekeeping force to Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 One Administration national security strategist agreed that early in his term 
Clinton had a propensity to view the United States in these U.N. deliberations 
"as just one more vote. . . . There were times when we were not willing to 
assert our own proportional weight in a collective manner." 
</P>
<P>
 But the strategist insisted that even if chastened about the need to exert 
leadership, the United States must continue to seek multinational cooperation 
-- both to share military burdens that the nation is unwilling to shoulder 
alone and to ensure concerted action against outlaw countries such as Iraq and 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the U.S. says we are basically going to break any embargo the U.N. put 
together that we don't agree with, it is going to be hard to argue to other 
sovereign nations that they should abide by embargoes we support," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument that the United States cannot afford to routinely act alone has 
undeniable force. Even Kemp insists that his criticism does not mean "to 
suggest we should be like the lone cowboy in foreign policy." But the recoil 
from U.N. peacekeeping, the reluctance to defer to the United Nations on the 
arms embargo in Bosnia and the anxiety about binding dispute resolution through 
the new World Trade Organization suggest that fears of eroding sovereignty that 
jolted the League of Nations 75 years ago still carry a charge in American 
politics today. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Clinton and his critics are trying to thread the needle between views 
that are close to contradictory: the beliefs that this nation cannot afford to 
act alone yet must not excessively rely on allies. In their struggles stand the 
continuing evidence of America's uncertainty about how to define and advance 
its aims in a world no longer defined by the Cold War.

COLLIDING POINTS OF VIEW IMPAIR LAGUNA REBUILDING; RECOVERY: PLANS FOR BIGGER 
HOMES IN FIRE AREA INFLAME PASSIONS OF NEIGHBORS WHOSE OUTLOOK IS INCREASINGLY 
GRIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Inside the meeting room, Jim Allen listened quietly, his face expressionless, 
a loyal neighbor at his side, as this city's oft-maligned Design Review Board 
all but assured him he could go forward with plans to rebuild on his 
fire-ravaged lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Once outside, however, the 63-year-old Allen released the breath he had seemed 
to be holding throughout the hearing and broke into a grin that left his ruddy 
face aglow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might as well figure it's passed," said Allen, whose wood and glass house 
was one of nine destroyed on Buena Vista Way in last October's wildfire. "It 
looks like we're on our way." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen and his wife, Jackie, 18-year residents of this once-picturesque section 
of the Temple Hills area, are but a step away from an important milestone on 
the neighborhood's road back from last fall's devastation. They appear 
virtually certain to become the first of their neighbors to emerge from 
Laguna's often arduous design review process and rebuild the elegant home they 
lost to the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments before the Allens' victory, though, the hopes of another of Buena 
Vista Way's fire victims were dashed, at least for now, when the powerful 
review board chastised Tom Homan for planning an imposing, two-story structure 
that would have "annihilated" the ocean view of his nearest neighbor. The board 
directed Homan to begin his plans again. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cases, involving homes that stood just 50 yards apart before the fire, 
illustrate conflicts that are increasingly common, as this seaside village 
struggles to recover from the devastating Oct. 27 blaze, which damaged or 
destroyed more than 400 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 And they offer a lesson: those who believed they had found a silver lining in 
the ashes -- the chance to build bigger, better dwellings than they had before 
-- may find themselves pitted against neighbors who are equally determined to 
hang on to valued aspects of their pre-fire lifestyles, such as priceless ocean 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a feeling that the fire victims deserve every break they get and I 
concur," said Carol Nilsen, whose 80-year-old father stayed behind during the 
evacuation and saved her home, just uphill from Homan's lot on Canyon View 
Drive, the street above Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've suffered and they need to come back strongly and well. But we also 
went through the fire, and our house survived because we fought to save it. And 
now we're struggling again to retain what we had before." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Abel, president of the Laguna Beach Architectural Guild, whose office is 
designing new homes for 16 fire victims, said such neighborhood conflicts can 
now be found throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all having a real tough time now because of the fire victims trying to 
increase the size of their houses and getting the neighbors fired up about loss 
of views," he said. "The emotions are just really running rampant." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute between Homan and several residents, particularly next-door 
neighbor and fellow fire victim Sheila Patterson, is the latest in a series of 
blows to hit Buena Vista Way. Each development has further reduced the number 
of original residents likely to return. 
</P>
<P>
 First came the firestorm, which incinerated nine houses and left some 
residents unwilling to endure the stresses of rebuilding. Next were reports 
that evidence of an ancient landslide had been found under several lots on 
Buena Vista and surrounding streets, prompting longtime residents Don and Jo 
Williamson to buy elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected landslide, the subject of a geological investigation now 
underway, already has delayed the rebuilding plans of several others who live 
within the 65-lot study area. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, with the Design Review Board warning that it would reject his plans 
to increase the height of his home from 12 to 21 feet, Homan says he may not 
return to Buena Vista Way, where he has lived since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it all boils down to politics and the city deciding to allow my 
neighbors to abuse my rights," Homan said angrily after Thursday's hearing, 
adding that he has spent at least $15,000 on plans and revisions that are now 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have to go to the city. I may have to go to court. And if I can't have 
the house I want, why should I even go back?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Allen, who is not involved in the dispute and has lamented the loss of 
a budding community spirit that developed on the street soon after the fire, 
said she hoped Homan would change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so sad this has to happen," she said. "It's bad enough what's happening 
to our street without all this. I just really want everybody to be congenial 
and have a happy street when we all get through." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Allens' own plan for a new, Mediterranean-style home at the end 
of Buena Vista Way sailed through the design review process virtually without a 
hitch. Patterson, the strongest critic of Homan's plan, spoke out in support of 
the Allens, whose home before the fire stood directly across the way from hers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Allens' architect, John McInnes, was promised approval of his design if he 
widened the size of the columns supporting the house before returning before 
the board this week. The Allens are still waiting for a settlement from their 
insurance company and must secure a building permit before breaking ground. 
They hope to begin construction on their new home in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Homan's scenario seems likely to occur with increasing frequency in Laguna in 
the weeks to come, as the desires of those hoping to rebuild conflict with the 
rights of other fire victims and the owners of existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people want to build bigger houses after the fire and I think it's 
OK that they should do that. They're trying to make the best out of a bad 
event," said J.J. Gasparotti, a contractor and one of five members of the 
Design Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're trying to preserve the character of the neighborhood if that's 
possible, and if someone wants to rebuild bigger, they can't take away the view 
of somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council-appointed review board, which must approve plans for all fire 
victims who want to build new homes at least 50% larger than the ones they 
lost, has often been controversial in Laguna, prompting frequent complaints 
about decisions perceived as arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
 But several architects said last week that recent rulings had been more 
reasonable than in the past. Many credited Chairman Bob Chapman for the 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has really improved considerably in the last six months," said Abel, who 
has worked as an architect in Laguna for more than 30 years. "I really feel 
that now you've got a number of competent people on there who are looking at 
what you're doing from an objective viewpoint. There are fewer subjective 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, any proposal that threatens homeowners' cherished views has 
always been sensitive in Laguna, whose hills and seaside location provide many 
residents with sweeping vistas of the Pacific and the city's landmarks, 
including Main Beach and the Hotel Laguna. Important to many for their beauty 
alone, the views of the water can also significantly affect a home's resale 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has a very personal idea about what makes a great view," longtime 
Laguna real estate agent Louise Turner said. "Some want a sweeping view, while 
others will settle for a little glimpse of the water. There's really no formula 
for it, but if the view is wiped out entirely, it can cost the owner thousands 
in property value." 
</P>
<P>
 Homan's problems began in April, when he and architect Hugo Soria submitted 
rebuilding plans to the city before consulting the neighbors who would be 
affected, including Patterson. Before the fire, her house stood just north of 
Homan's, around a slight bend. 
</P>
<P>
 She and two other residents, whose homes just uphill from Homan's survived the 
fire, immediately protested several parts of his plan, most significantly that 
his new house would block all or part of their views. 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 17 letter to Homan, Patterson accused him of "deliberately 
misleading" her and others about the size of the new home and how it might 
affect their views. 
</P>
<P>
 Homan and Soria say they have tried to meet their neighbors halfway. They 
lowered the roof line of the planned house, shrank the size of its master 
bedroom and agreed to install awnings over some second-story windows that had 
caused one neighbor concerns about privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Homan acknowledges he declined to consider suggestions that he dig a deeper 
foundation, rather than building a new home on his old slab, which stood more 
than a full story above street level. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he had been assured that his old foundation was sound despite the 
fire, a point that both his neighbors and the Design Review Board questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, Patterson argued that if the home were built, she would find 
herself gazing at an "unmitigated slab of stucco" instead of the ocean view she 
enjoyed before the fire, when she could look over or around the corner of 
Homan's one-story home. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilsen and Warren Toman, whose home above Homan's also made it through the 
fire, told the board that the planned house would impair their views, a change 
Toman earlier had likened to erasing the lower half of a much-loved painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Homan heatedly dismissed the view complaints and accused Patterson, whom he 
had characterized before the fire as a friend, of being selfish. And he called 
the suggestions that he lower the starting point of his house "idiotic" and 
"poppycock." 
</P>
<P>
 "What they're talking about is beyond thought," said Homan, 41. "I don't buy 
it. . . . I think I should be given my rights, period." 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, however, each board member told Homan they could not support his 
plan, largely because his home would block Patterson's view. Before he returned 
before them in a month, they suggested, Homan should explore ways to lower the 
house, perhaps by excavating his hillside and placing a second story below the 
level of his old first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman said the board was simply acting on the City Council's promise to help 
its fire victims regain what they had lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that means they should be able to get back the same view they had 
before too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Patterson sounded conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd really like to see everybody come home after the fire, but I don't want 
to lose everything in the process, either," she said. "My feeling was that he 
could have had all the view he wanted without interfering with anyone else, but 
he just got greedy." Battle Plans 
</P>
<P>
 Two Buena Vista Way residents who submitted rebuilding plans to Laguna Beach's 
Design Review Board have met with very different results. Neighbors and the 
board balked at one plan for a much larger house, but a nearby home received 
the green light. 
</P>
<P>
 Couple's plan wins unanimous approval 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors fear new house would block view

COLUMN ONE; PLUNDER OF EARTH BEGAN WITH MAN; EXPLODING MYTHS OF A 
PRE-INDUSTRIAL PARADISE, RESEARCHERS SAY EVEN THE OLDEST CIVILIZATIONS HAVE 
PILLAGED THE EARTH. THEY URGE US TO LEARN FROM THE MISTAKES OF EASTER ISLANDERS 
AND THE MAYA.

<P>
 When Dutch explorers landed on Easter Island in 1722, there was not a single 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Most ecologists assumed that the isolated Pacific island, now known as Rapa 
Nui, had always been barren. Recent studies, however, reveal that it once was 
covered with lush forests that were slashed and burned when humans moved there 
about AD 500. 
</P>
<P>
 The rape of Rapa Nui, archeologists are now discovering, is not unique. 
Whereas environmentalists and historians once believed that early humans lived 
in harmony with their environment, growing evidence reveals that people have 
plundered the Earth wherever and whenever they have lived. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first civilizations along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers -- in what 
is now Iraq -- to the Mayan empire of Central America, experts are beginning to 
agree, people have pillaged natural resources, denuded forests and sterilized 
fields with unwanted salt. Environmental devastation, it would seem, has been 
an almost inevitable companion of civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 And today, as society faces environmental problems ranging from deforestation 
and loss of biodiversity to salinization of farmland, many archeologists 
believe society can profit by studying where these civilizations went wrong. 
"We can look to the past to see the future," said Charles L. Redman of Arizona 
State University. 
</P>
<P>
 This new environmental awakening is bringing archeologists such as Redman down 
from their ivory towers, where they have chronicled early humans, and thrusting 
them into the hurly-burly of activism and ecological prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hallmark focus of this generation is a redefining of archeology" from a 
rather abstract pursuit to one that has direct impact on day-to-day concerns, 
Redman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make the point that archeology is more than just an indulgence of 
a rich society," said Don S. Rice of Southern Illinois University. "We really 
do have something to say to future generations." 
</P>
<P>
 One impetus for the new approach is the deforestation of Central and South 
America and the accompanying loss of biodiversity -- a broad and complex 
abundance of species in such wilderness areas. Ecologists argue that 
biodiversity must be maintained because it provides a potential source of 
drugs, foods and other products that will be invaluable to future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 In planning biological preserves, Rice argues, archeological data is crucial 
to demonstrating how many people regions could support in the past and what the 
outcomes were. "It's hard to do this with short-term data," he said. "It's a 
little easier with a millennium of data from archeology." 
</P>
<P>
 Another important issue facing the United States and other nations is the 
degradation of soil quality, which ultimately threatens a society's ability to 
feed itself. Many earlier societies collapsed simply because of erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging recognition of the unintentional destructiveness of past 
civilizations is blasting apart "the escapist idea of the primordial paradise," 
that pre-industrial societies were composed of great environmentalists who 
lived in harmony with their surroundings, Redman said. 
</P>
<P>
 One key to destroying these myths is the relatively new science of 
paleolimnology, the study of lake sediment. As silt from rivers and streams 
collects in lake bottoms, it carries pollen, ashes, eroded soil and other 
characteristic markers that provide a time-ordered history of a region. 
</P>
<P>
 By studying pollen in sediment dating from a particular period, for example, 
researchers can tell what types of vegetation grew naturally and what was 
raised by farmers. The disappearance of tree pollen is a strong indicator of 
deforestation. Another is the supplanting of wood ash by ash from animal dung, 
which is commonly burned when wood is unavailable. Large quantities of ash from 
the burning of buildings is a marker for warfare or environmental catastrophe, 
such as volcanic eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 These kinds of studies "have revolutionized our understanding of the past," 
said Patrick V. Kirch of UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirch and colleague David W. Steadman have developed a 3,500-year chronology 
from a crater lake on Rapa Nui, which is about 1,400 miles from the nearest 
land and is famous for its large stone heads. Before Polynesians settled there, 
the pollen record shows, Rapa Nui had "radically different vegetation," 
including lush forests and broad savannas, Kirch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 700 years, he said, the population of the minuscule island had grown to 
10,000 and the landscape was "virtually treeless." Traditional archeological 
techniques, including fossil excavation, showed that many animals had been 
killed off as "a direct result of human actions, " he said. Among 30 species of 
sea birds, they found, only eight survived, while none of six types of land 
birds survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Artifacts excavated from dwellings show that as resources dwindled, the 
islanders fell into brutal warfare fighting for what little was left, until 
eventually there was little of anything for anybody. In sediments, thick 
deposits of ash from burned buildings and fields also suggest widespread 
warfare. Kirch found the same pattern on islands throughout Polynesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to (free) ourselves of the old assumptions that early societies had 
little impact on their environment," he said. "And the most critical message is 
the inevitable effects of population increase." 
</P>
<P>
 A world away, in the gray North Atlantic, the Norse colonized their offshore 
islands around AD 800 in a pattern that Thomas Amorosi of the City University 
of New York calls "rape, ruin and starve." They overpopulated the islands, 
overgrazed the fields and introduced agricultural practices that promoted soil 
erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent silt studies have shown that food production was down, erosion had 
reached disastrous levels and the Norse were barely clinging to the islands 
when the Little Ice Age struck in the 1370s; it proved to be their death knell. 
Norse populations of Greenland and Vinland died out by 1500 and Iceland's fell 
dramatically. Only the indigenous Inuit tribes, who adapted their lifestyles to 
hunting and fishing in the colder climate, persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 The destruction of earlier civilizations as a result of poor farming practices 
provides a strong argument for changes in current soil-management policies, 
Amorosi said. Erosion is a growing problem in the U.S. Midwest, Redman noted, 
with large quantities of fertile soil being washed downstream to the 
Mississippi Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the chief lessons to be learned from early societies, Redman noted, is 
that farmland deteriorated when agriculture was centrally controlled by the 
government -- as is the case today in Russia, China and some developing 
countries -- rather than by local farmers who knew how to maintain soil 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil salinization caused by extensive irrigation also played a major role in 
the downfall of several societies, beginning with one of the earliest, 
Mesopotamia in the Middle East. Salinization is caused by the accumulation of 
mineral salts when irrigation water evaporates. As the concentration of the 
toxic salts increases, farming becomes more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2000 BC, the Ur III dynasty was flourishing in the southern half of 
Mesopotamia, which comprised cities with tens of thousands of inhabitants. The 
society invented laws, developed writing and nourished itself with wheat and 
other winter-cultivated cereals, and sheepherding. 
</P>
<P>
 As the soil became more saline, recent sediment studies have shown, 
agriculture shifted from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley; by 1700 BC, 
"there was no more barley," Redman said. The society became dependent on 
imported grains before collapsing under the burden of overpopulation. One of 
the last written records from Ur, Redman said, is a plaintive message from the 
king to one of his functionaries in the hinterlands: "Where is my shipment of 
grain?" 
</P>
<P>
 "These were a gifted, intelligent people, the pinnacle of the past," Redman 
said. "If they couldn't handle their interactions with their environment, that 
is a serious condemnation of human organization." Even today, the Mesopotamian 
lands lie fallow, choked by plant-killing salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinization and deforestation -- as well as over-hunting -- were villains in 
the U.S. Southwest as well. When people first arrived in North America around 
12,000 BC, the Southwest was like the Serengeti plain of Africa, said Redman, 
teeming with a bewildering variety of large animals -- the so-called 
mega-fauna, which included saber-toothed tigers, woolly mammoths and monstrous 
bears three times the size of those today. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 10,000 BC, as scientists discovered long ago, the bulk of those animals 
were extinct, leaving behind only buffalo, elk and other modern species. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinization spelled the doom of the Hohokam, who lived in central Arizona, in 
the area centered on present-day Phoenix, from the time of Christ until about 
1400. Conventional studies have recently shown that the Hohokam constructed 
elaborate irrigation canal systems, according to Glen Rice of Arizona State 
University. Their civilization collapsed, like that in Mesopotamia, when the 
soil became too salty to support agriculture -- a condition that persists 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounds painfully like what is going on today in California and many 
other farming regions around the world," Don Rice said. Salinization can be 
countered by reducing irrigation and by growing crops that require less water. 
Such changes are not being made, he said, because short-term profits still 
outweigh long-term environmental consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 North of Phoenix, the Chaco Canyon area was magnificently forested in the 
pre-industrial era. The Anasazi built five-story buildings with 40-foot rooms 
spanned by timbers from huge trees. "But there is not a tall tree in the area 
today," Redman said. 
</P>
<P>
 As population and wealth grew, so did demands on the local forest for firewood 
and building materials, he said. And as the trees and their extensive root 
systems disappeared, the thin soil eroded quickly, sediment studies show. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a really complex society that is simply gone," he said. "This is not 
a matter of a great drought or some other external force. The society fell of 
its own internal weight from systematic deforestation." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest romance has surrounded the Central American societies of 
the Aztecs, Teotihuacan and Maya -- complex societies that created their own 
written language, built massive temples and architecturally sophisticated 
cities, perfected intensive agriculture and developed astronomy. They 
flourished for more than a millennium until, one by one, they mysteriously 
collapsed, with the Maya being the last to fall, around AD 900. 
</P>
<P>
 A team headed by Sarah L. O'Hara of the University of Sheffield in England 
studied more than 4,000 years of sediment cores from Lake Patzcuaro, west of 
Mexico City, and found three distinct periods of erosion. A minor episode 
occurred 3,900 to 3,250 years ago, when the site was first occupied. More 
serious erosion occurred from about 2600 to 1350 years ago, when classical 
civilizations thrived in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 But by far the most destructive era was from about 1200 to the arrival of the 
Spanish in the 16th Century, a period when the region was occupied by a people 
known as the Purepecha. O'Hara's team reported last year that the erosion 
totaled as much as 85 tons of soil per acre per year, an amount she called 
"staggeringly high." 
</P>
<P>
 The demise of the Maya, who once dominated large regions of what are now 
Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, has been particularly intriguing. A variety 
of recent evidence suggests that internal warfare played a major role in the 
collapse, but many researchers believe that environmental problems were at the 
root of that warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent studies by Don Rice have shown that the Maya had destroyed more than 
80% of the region's forests by the time of their demise in the 1600s. Loss of 
forest, in turn, speeded erosion, slashing farming productivity and reducing 
the ability of individual city-states to be self-sufficient. By the time the 
Spanish invaded, the Maya had lost 75% of their population. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining people were slaughtered by the Spanish or succumbed to disease 
inadvertently introduced by the invaders. Ironically, the Spanish conquest 
proved to be a remarkable stimulus to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed from the burdens of overpopulation, vegetation exploded, producing rain 
forests that had not existed during the time of the Maya. Only recently, Don 
Rice said, have researchers recognized that these forests are a new phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture painted by archeologists is not entirely gloomy. "The upside 
is that many societies, like the Maya, were around for a very long time," 
Redman said. "Some did strikingly well for hundreds of years. We need to learn 
from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, more important, we need to find out why people have repeatedly adopted 
short-term strategies with dire long-term consequences."

U.S. DRAFTS COMPROMISE ON N. KOREA; ASIA: PLAN TO BE SUBMITTED TO U.N. THIS 
WEEK WOULD FIRST TARGET SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES IF PYONGYANG 
CONTINUES TO DEFY NUCLEAR INSPECTORS. GOAL IS TO ENLIST CRITICAL PLAYERS, LIKE 
JAPAN, AND FORESTALL CHINESE VETO.

<P>
 The United States has prepared a draft resolution designed to pressure North 
Korea by further isolating it in cultural, scientific and diplomatic areas, but 
it falls short of immediate full economic sanctions, U.S. officials said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, to be submitted to the United Nations this week, would apply 
stiffer sanctions at a later date if the regime of President Kim Il Sung 
continues to prevent international inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The "phased" sanctions plan, which is being hammered out this weekend by the 
Clinton Administration, is effectively a compromise designed to guarantee 
support from reticent but critical players in the escalating drama, notably 
Japan, and to ensure that China does not veto the plan. As one of five 
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China has the power to veto any 
resolution that comes before it. 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing has long been Pyongyang's closest ally and has repeatedly declared its 
opposition to an international economic embargo against North Korea. While 
China still may not vote for a sanctions resolution, U.S. officials hope it 
will at least abstain in any U.N. vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the draft resolution is to spell out the costs of repudiating the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, which is seeking the nuclear inspections, 
without imposing stiff measures that might lead North Korea to take even more 
dangerous steps, a U.S. official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make a serious response without throwing the baby out with the 
bathwater. So we'll hold in reserve a much tougher set of sanctions that will 
bite economically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mild sanctions in the first phase of the proposed sanctions could include 
stopping scientific and cultural exchanges and halting U.N. technical 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. strategy is a step back from a tougher package developed by the 
Clinton Administration after North Korea stalled long enough to prevent an IAEA 
team from inspecting samplings from a nuclear reactor -- evidence that could 
indicate the scope of a suspected nuclear weapons program. Pyongyang has denied 
that it has any nuclear warheads, but the CIA estimates that it has already 
manufactured enough weapons-grade plutonium to make one or two nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new strategy would basically offer North Korea a choice between further 
sanctions that would devastate its already troubled economy and financial 
incentives to help bail it out. 
</P>
<P>
 And North Korea has signaled that it might be open to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 An American scholar who met with Kim last week said the regime has offered to 
"freeze" operations of two key nuclear facilities suspected of producing 
weapons-grade plutonium in return for help in acquiring safer, more modern 
nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig Harrison, Asia specialist with the Carnegie Endowment for International 
Peace, said Saturday in Beijing that several senior North Korean officials, 
including Kim, have told him of their readiness to halt operations at the two 
controversial nuclear facilities that have graphite-based reactors. According 
to experts, alternative "light water" reactors are safer and much more 
difficult to use as a source of weapons-grade plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 Although construction of new reactors could take as long as eight years, 
Harrison said the North Koreans offered to "suspend" the operations of the 
graphite facilities as soon as an agreement could be reached to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft of the sanctions resolution, which U.S. officials cautioned may 
undergo changes before it is presented at the United Nations as early as 
midweek, follows a week of intense consultations between the United States and 
its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Istanbul, the Turkish capital, Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
attended a NATO summit and held talks Friday with Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrei V. Kozyrev and others. Those talks led to another compromise as 
Washington agreed to reward North Korea with an international conference, which 
would discuss economic incentives and symbolize its re-entry into the world 
community, if Pyongyang complies with the IAEA. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Japan promised to support sanctions against North Korea, whether 
imposed by the Security Council or in a separate alliance with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be no choice but for Japan to cooperate," Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai said in a speech in Hamamatsu, Japan. He called the decision a 
matter of "whether to continue or to abandon the nearly 50 years of post-World 
War II prosperity brought on by the U.S.-Japan alliance." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, meeting with his South Korean counterpart, Han 
Sung Joo, in Seoul, said, "Japan regards suspicions of North Korea's 
development of nuclear weapons as an issue of concern to Japan itself." But he 
added, "It is important to keep open the door to dialogue with North Korea," 
stressing his government's desire for a milder approach at first. 
</P>
<P>
 Kakizawa leaves for Beijing today to add to appeals that China not block any 
punitive measures. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate meeting in Seoul, U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff and 
South Korean Unification Minister Lee Hong Ku also backed the step-by-step 
sanctions approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy fits in with what key U.S. officials have been saying over the 
past two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sanctions are not an end. They are a tool so that we can make sure of several 
things," Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said 
Friday on the "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." 
</P>
<P>
 "One is that we want the North Koreans to come back to the negotiating table. 
We want to set up some way to reconstruct this history. . . . But the more 
important part of this is to protect the future, so that we can make sure they 
do not have the capability to make more weapons-grade material and weapons 
themselves," she said.

JERICHO'S GUESSING GAME: WHEN WILL ARAFAT ARRIVE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A five-bedroom villa has been rented, the town's merchants are finishing their 
cleanup campaign, the Palestinian Scouts are practicing their marching and 
drumming, and vantage points have been found for nearly 100 television cameras 
around Jericho's main square. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one in Jericho has an answer -- one that is not rank speculation -- for 
the question that everyone is asking: "When is Yasser Arafat coming?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the head of 
the new Palestinian Authority governing the Gaza Strip and the Jericho District 
in the West Bank, readily gives out hints -- "before the end of this month," 
"within days," "soon" -- but he has not yet said precisely when. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Tunis, we hear everything and nothing," a Palestinian official said of 
the PLO headquarters in the Tunisian capital. "Every day we get new possible 
dates, new scenarios, new requests, but none of it amounts to a plan. . . . 
Well, if Rome was not built in a day, neither, I suspect, will Palestine." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the uncertainty is bringing Angst to Palestinians here in Jericho, in the 
rest of the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, for Arafat's ceremonial return to 
his homeland is intended to symbolize not just the end of Israeli occupation 
but the start of Palestinian rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "These men are preparing the way, just that," Ahmed Abdel Rahman, 48, a 
merchant visiting from the West Bank city of Hebron, said as he watched a squad 
of the new Palestinian police cart furniture and files into a government office 
building. "Only when Arafat arrives will we have self-government." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Saeb Erekat, the minister for local government in the Palestinian 
Authority, denied it with vehemence, ticking off the 22 departments that have 
been staffed and the 393 official forms that have been printed, Jericho and 
Gaza have fallen into an interregnum with the end of Israel's military 
government and the fumbling start of Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Letters cannot be mailed from local post offices because the Palestinian 
Authority has not printed any stamps, Israeli identification cards are still 
used by all, including the newly arrived police offices and PLO officials, and 
local merchants are providing almost everything on credit because the new 
government has yet to open a bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a fool would think that we could reverse 27 years of Israeli occupation 
in a month," Erekat said. "In fact, we are engaged in something even larger and 
more profound -- the establishment of the first Palestinian government and 
eventually the first Palestinian state." 
</P>
<P>
 For most Palestinians, however, Arafat is the symbol of that process -- and 
his absence is equally significant. 
</P>
<P>
 With his black-and-white headdress starched and artfully draped in the shape 
of historic Palestine, his military tunic and his seemingly permanent three-day 
stubble, Arafat became the emblematic figure in the national struggle for 
self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, people are impatient for Arafat's arrival for it represents our 
takeoff point," Erekat said. "The Israeli withdrawal, the Palestinian police, 
PLO cadres arriving -- all is preparatory. In the minds of the people, autonomy 
begins when Arafat crosses the Allenby Bridge into Jericho." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, who spoke with Erekat by telephone from Tunis on Saturday on a variety 
of issues, said only that he would be here "very soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has ordered most of the PLO headquarters to leave Tunis by Wednesday, 
and PLO officials here were given a similar midweek deadline for all 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 But little, it seems, can be done without Arafat, whose autocratic manner of 
leadership has long been a problem within the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat retains the authority on all policy rulings, delegating very little 
even to ministers like Erekat, and he will make the key decisions, he has said, 
after assessing the situation personally. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's primary appointments here and in Gaza have been almost solely police, 
security and intelligence officials and, at Israel's insistence, two-thirds of 
the governing council; other appointments can wait, he has said, until he 
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 And Arafat has kept control of the Palestinian Authority's funds, both those 
that will come from international donors for the operations of the new 
government and economic development and those of the PLO that he has stashed 
away over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat is letting the tension build deliberately," said a leading member of 
the opposition Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, asking as most 
Palestinians do that he not be quoted by name in discussing Arafat. "He wants 
to demonstrate his centrality to the political process -- that without him, 
nothing will be done -- and he wants to ensure that he retains control." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's efforts to script his return for maximum political benefit were 
evident in his demand this month for the release of operating funds from 
Western donors as a condition for his arrival here. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the donors allocated $42 million in immediate assistance, enough to 
last through August. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat must also clear his visit with Israel. He promised Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin two weeks' notice, and he has not given that yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he wants to arrive with all the pomp due a national leader who 
brought the reversal of his people's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat wants more than a royal welcome," said Mohammed abu Rish. "This is to 
be the welcome for a conquering hero, a leader who freed his people." 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, Arafat has also made it clear in recent weeks that he will be 
visiting Jericho and probably Gaza but that he probably will spend most of his 
time in Tunis for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Trusted Arafat lieutenants, sent from PLO headquarters in Tunis, are planning 
his arrival, and they talk of mass jubilation, an outpouring of emotion, a 
celebration that will echo around the world from this sleepy oasis town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tens of thousands of people will pour in from around the West Bank," said 
Mohammed Shaker, a police spokesman. "We expected maybe 100,000, if the town 
can hold that many. The rest will watch by television. You have to understand 
how long we have waited for this moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Transformation of Hisham's Palace, the main hotel with 30 rooms, into a press 
center with 100 international telephone lines and impromptu television studios 
will be completed shortly to serve the anticipated 3,000 journalists expected 
to descend on little Jericho, population 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S., European and Japanese television crews have made arrangements with local 
residents to rent their balconies and rooftops, generally at a cost of $3,000 
to $5,000, to cover Arafat's arrival and anticipated speech from City Hall in 
Jericho's main square. 
</P>
<P>
 Jericho, meanwhile, is enjoying a boom as the interim seat of the Palestinian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Land prices have soared, and a shopping center, office complex and new hotel 
are under construction. Jobs are so plentiful, residents say, that Palestinians 
are coming from the Jerusalem area, 20 miles west, to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows when the president (Arafat) is coming, but we'll be ready," said 
Lt. Col. Munther Ersheid, the police officer presiding over the town 
government. "The paving is coming along, street lights are being fixed, the 
shopkeepers are painting up -- it is a start on the changes we want to see all 
over Palestine. It will be a big day, but when it will come I can't say."

U.S. DILEMMA: IS KOREA DISPUTE REASON FOR WAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is the U.S. dispute with North Korea over nuclear weapons really worth risking 
a second Korean War? 
</P>
<P>
 That is the blunt question facing the Clinton Administration as North Korea 
stubbornly refuses to allow international inspection of a nuclear plant and the 
Administration pushes for U.N. economic sanctions that Pyongyang has warned it 
would consider an act of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some dismiss the North Korean warnings as bluster, senior 
Administration policy-makers and outside analysts caution that the country's 
aging leader, Kim Il Sung, is erratic enough to make military conflict a 
serious possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is headed for a Rubicon on this issue," said Peter A. Wilson, a 
former State Department strategist who has been keeping tabs on the U.S.-North 
Korea dispute. And the decision on whether to cross, he said, may not be very 
far off. 
</P>
<P>
 By any measure, the stakes are substantial -- far greater than in Haiti, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or any of the world's other current hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence reports suggest that North Korea is poised to launch a major push 
in its nuclear weapons program, despite the threat of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA officials say North Korea already may have one or two nuclear weapons in 
stock and could well have five more bombs by the end of the year and 30 to 40 
within two years. Moreover, Pyongyang is rapidly developing intermediate-range 
missiles that could easily carry such warheads to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Both U.S. and foreign analysts warn that if North Korea acquires a nuclear 
arsenal, it could turn the strategic balance in Asia upside down and set off a 
regional race for nuclear weapons involving South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, 
which now are nuclear free. 
</P>
<P>
 And rogue states such as Iran and Libya, which already buy missiles and other 
conventional weapons from North Korea, might be able to acquire nuclear arms 
from Pyongyang as well, seriously threatening the West. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the risks of inaction are great, the consequences of action could be 
grave as well. Most military analysts are confident that, 41 years after the 
first Korean War ended in a stalemate, the United States and South Korea 
ultimately would win decisively if the North invaded South Korea -- but only at 
the cost of enormous casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1.1 million North Korean troops now massed near the border, current 
estimates are that allied troops could suffer as many as 18,000 casualties in 
the first few days of a war. The United States now has 37,000 troops in South 
Korea, and South Korea has 650,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And unless the North Koreans decided to bypass Seoul for tactical reasons, 
South Korea's prosperous capital city most likely would end up in ruins. "It's 
not a pretty picture," said Robert W. Gaskin, a former Pentagon strategist who 
now is a vice president of Business Executives for National Security, a 
defense-monitoring group. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's war rhetoric reached a new stridence last week when it renewed 
its warnings to the United States and Japan not to miscalculate the possibility 
of military conflict. The North Koreans bluntly told Japan that it would be 
"unable to evade a deserving punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 In such a climate, opinion here is sharply divided over how far the United 
States should go to prod North Korea to abandon -- or merely to halt -- its 
nuclear program. The bottom-line question is whether it should risk a new war. 
</P>
<P>
 "The simple answer is no -- but you can't say that, because the whole concept 
of deterrence is the ability to threaten things you don't mean," said Janne 
Nolan, a Brookings Institution nuclear weapons expert. "It's a question of at 
what point do you stop?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The trick is to orchestrate this in a way that puts so much pressure on the 
North that they are intimidated and back away," said Leonard S. Spector, a 
Carnegie Endowment national security analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservatives such as Henry Sokolski, a former Pentagon nuclear weapons 
expert, argue that while enforcing the international nuclear inspection program 
is laudable, Clinton is misguided in hinging U.S. policy on North Korea's 
refusal to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although international inspections are useful, Sokolski said, "their urgency 
is highly overrated. . . . They certainly are not worth going to war over or 
pleading for U.N. sanctions to secure. Nor are they worth making any further 
concessions to North Korea to obtain." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he asserted, "if U.S. officials are really serious about addressing 
the North Korean threat, they would do well to back off their preoccupation 
with nuclear inspections and instead get on with the serious business of 
containing . . . the North Korean regime." 
</P>
<P>
 That would mean drawing North Korea into broader negotiations designed to make 
the country more prosperous and to coax it into unification with the more 
democratic South. "Once you change the (North Korean) regime, you can get 
satisfaction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue that the Administration is making too much of the current 
"crisis" with North Korea. The United States did not react nearly this strongly 
when Pakistan, India and Israel acquired nuclear weapons, they reason. Why, 
they ask, is North Korea's case any different? 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the Arms Control Assn., a private arms 
control group, has identified some of the reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Unlike North Korea, the governments of Pakistan, India and Israel are not 
members of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and therefore are not legally 
obligated to allow international inspectors to catalogue their facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although India and Pakistan frequently have threatened each other, none of 
the three countries has used its nuclear weapons to threaten general 
destruction. By contrast, North Korea has a track record of terrorism around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * North Korea's nuclear weapons, unlike those of India, Pakistan and Israel, 
might prompt Japan to build a bomb, a move that almost certainly would spur 
other Asian countries to go nuclear and change the entire security balance in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 To many analysts, the Clinton Administration is partly responsible for the 
current standoff with North Korea. The United States backed itself into a 
corner by declaring from the start that the crucial issue in the dispute would 
be North Korea's compliance with the non-proliferation treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more critical, the Administration's apparent waffling on the issue -- it 
seems to have swung from conciliation to dire warnings and back several times 
within a month -- has failed to provide a clear signal that Washington means 
business and is willing to go to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Policy-makers have publicly rejected suggestions that the United States launch 
a preemptive strike to knock out North Korea's nuclear weapons plants. The 
facilities are buried deep underground, and an attack would almost surely lead 
to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry has repeatedly said that Washington is 
unlikely to consider military action unless it sees evidence that the North is 
about to invade South Korea again. "We will not provoke a war," he has told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, one proposed set of sanctions would impose a naval blockade 
to help enforce a U.N. trade embargo -- a move that North Korea would almost 
certainly consider provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 And pressure for firm action is growing here at home. Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.) argues that the only way to make North Korea listen is to mount a 
credible military threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we've got to prepare for war," Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) said on CBS' 
"Face the Nation" program last Sunday. "We've got to say to the North Koreans, 
'If that's the game that you want to play, regrettably we're prepared to play 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 An ABC News poll last week showed that 48% of Americans support allied 
military action to bring North Korea into line -- though whether the 
respondents understood all the implications of such a policy is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts remain uncertain about whether the White House has the resolve 
to bring the United States to the brink of war to halt the North Korean nuclear 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the former State Department strategist, worries that the 
Administration still has not seriously addressed the possibility that the U.S. 
policy could lead to war. "At this point, it's unclear that there has been any 
systematic effort to think through that question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working against Clinton is his failure to carry through on earlier threats 
involving Somalia, Bosnia and Haiti. Wilson cautioned that failure to resolve 
the North Korean dispute could make Clinton vulnerable to charges that he 
allowed the situation to get out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, he said, "if the United States is perceived as unable to solve this 
crisis, then the biggest proliferation problem we face will not be with states 
such as Iraq and Iran. It will be with our friends , such as South Korea and 
Japan."

HOSTILITY TO 'OUTSIDERS' ROOTED IN U.S. PAST; IMMIGRATION: HISTORIAN SAYS 
DISTRUST OF NEWCOMERS SEEMS TO BE PART OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER. BUT 
ONCE-SHUNNED GROUPS ARE EVENTUALLY EMBRACED INTO THE MAINSTREAM.

<P>
 California's bitter divisions over illegal immigration echo patterns 
experienced by Americans throughout the nation's history and will ease once the 
economy brightens and the newcomers' social contributions become more evident, 
according to a noted historian. 
</P>
<P>
 John Blum, a professor emeritus of history at Yale University, said immigrants 
"have always been greeted by a kind of nativism -- especially during times of 
economic difficulty like California has recently faced." 
</P>
<P>
 But eventually, Blum said, the new arrivals acculturate, move out of 
poverty-infested "pockets of apartheid" and enrich the economy and social 
vitality of their adopted land. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, local governments are aware only of the burdens brought by 
strangers," he said. "But in the long run, if we're patient and encourage 
assimilation, immigration will prove to be a benefit to California." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum and fellow Yale historian Gaddis Smith presented their views at a weekend 
seminar for Yale alumni. The conference explored a broad range of topics -- 
from national security threats in the Pacific to government's role in economic 
growth -- from a historical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum's lecture on America's deep-rooted xenophobia was particularly timely for 
California, where debate over undocumented immigrants and their use of public 
services has reached an election-year fever pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Gov. Pete Wilson sued the federal government to recover costs 
associated with illegal immigrants, claiming that they are sapping the state 
budget, taking jobs from legal residents and swamping hospital emergency rooms. 
In November, California voters may face a ballot initiative -- dubbed "save our 
state" by its sponsors -- that would expel undocumented youths from public 
schools and drastically cut health services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lecture and in remarks afterward, Blum traced the evolution of 
America's wariness of foreigners, noting that it "began with the colonists, who 
held the view that somehow the good people had come here and the bad people had 
stayed home in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, he said, that feeling evolved into a "persistent, non-rational 
attitude" on behalf of Americans that "they are somehow a special people and no 
one is quite fit to join them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1850s, it was the Germans and Irish who encountered American 
ethnocentrism. Fleeing economic destitution, these immigrants raised fears that 
the "good old stock of America would be vulgarized by interrelationships" with 
a lower class of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese, who came to California during the Gold Rush, encountered a 
similarly chilly reception. And in the 1880s and 1890s, the first wave of 
eastern and southern European immigrants arrived and found themselves "twice 
stigmatized" -- by their darker skin and their religion, Catholicism, which was 
viewed dimly by a largely Protestant land. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws reflecting the nation's xenophobia came as early as 1798, when Congress 
passed the Act Concerning Aliens, giving the President unprecedented powers to 
deport all immigrants he deemed dangerous to national security. Later, there 
was the 1924 National Origins Act, which greatly restricted immigration 
according to a system designed to prevent major change in the country's racial 
and ethnic makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hostile climate and other obstacles, Blum said, each immigrant 
group has, over several generations, moved from "segregation to acculturation." 
Typically, he said, newcomers have built their own professional institutions -- 
law firms, for instance -- and, after demonstrating their abilities to the 
doubting society at large, have been embraced into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring himself "optimistic about California," Blum said these "successful 
patterns of the past will replicate themselves in the future. We merely have to 
find the commonalities. It sounds banal, but we're all Americans after all."

EX-CONVICT HELD IN SLAYING OF SPORTFISHERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-convict on parole for robbery has been arrested on suspicion of murder 
in the shooting last week of a sportfisherman at Big Bear Lake, according to 
the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffory Burton Paxton, 25, was arrested Friday night by deputies who had 
staked out his house trailer in a vineyard in Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxton was being held on $1 million bond in connection with the killing 
Wednesday of Armen Shakhkaramyan, 47, during a lakeside robbery in the San 
Bernardino Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakhkaramyan was killed and a companion, Sarkis Aylozlan, 28, was wounded 
when a robber blasted gunshots through the side of the station wagon in which 
the pair were resting during a fishing excursion to Big Bear Lake, deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two companions of the victims said they had surrendered their wallets to the 
gunman, but he opened fire anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 A getaway car was abandoned when it crashed on California 18 about five miles 
from the shooting and three men, believed to have been involved in the killing, 
hitchhiked down the mountain from the wreck, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrecked car was traced to Paxton, deputies said. He was arrested about 10 
p.m. after driving another car with its lights out through a vineyard road to 
his house trailer, Sheriff's Sgt. Pierre Ingersoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He parked his car, went into the trailer, grabbed clothes, threw them in the 
car and took off through the vineyard," Ingersoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxton surrendered without incident when deputies stopped his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'I'm the guy you're looking for,' " Ingersoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other suspects have not been caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakhkaramyan, a plumber and mechanic from Moscow, had been in the United 
States for about a year and was living with relatives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends said they thought a fishing trip to the usually peaceful lake 
would be a relaxing break from the city.

CAPS AND GROANS FOR JOB-SEEKING GRADUATES; EDUCATION: CLASS OF '94 IS 
PESSIMISTIC ABOUT FINDING EMPLOYMENT EVEN THOUGH PROSPECTS ARE ON THE UPSWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Although jobs are somewhat more plentiful, Tom Luu -- a 22-year-old economics 
major at UCLA -- has a bad case of the graduation blues. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $8,000 in debt and with a string of job rejection letters to his 
name, Luu is so bummed out about graduating next weekend that he does not want 
to invite his parents down from the Bay Area for commencement exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard . . . with the rejection letters coming in," Luu said. "At 
first, you don't take it personally but after a while it's hard not to. 
Sometimes, I feel like I'm lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Luu is not alone. Despite an uptick in the economy and hopeful stirrings by 
employers, many in the Class of 1994 are approaching graduation with no little 
dread. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who plunge into the changing market are steeling themselves with a 
toughened view of reality for the arduous job search ahead. Others have opted 
for graduate school to enhance their marketability, while some deal with the 
anxiety by taking temporary jobs, traveling or taking their time to find 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't started the job hunt as yet -- I just couldn't deal with it," said 
Stanford University economics major Susie Hassan, 22, who plans to look for 
employment after today's commencement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty big time commitment and I made a conscious decision not to do 
it right now," she said. "I realize that I've probably let some opportunities 
pass by, but there's always next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Even during good economic times, graduating classes suffer a postpartum 
depression of sorts when they leave the comfortable university environment, 
said Patrick Scheetz, director of the Collegiate Employment Research Institute 
at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year's class -- subjected to four years of doom and gloom dispatches 
about corporate layoffs, vanishing professional opportunities and a decline in 
the standard of living -- is definitely in a much deeper funk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very lackadaisical attitude among the graduates this year," Scheetz 
said. "This is a group of students who came through college expecting that 
tomorrow is going to be worse than yesterday. The market is turning around and 
they don't know how to handle this." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, Scheetz and other placement officials say, is that employers 
will hire 1.1% more graduates this year; there has been a surge of firms 
seeking pre-graduation interviews at Stanford, USC and other California 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, firms booked 12,000 half-hour job interview slots this spring -- more 
than the average of 10,000 slots that employers sought before the recession, 
said Tina Oakland, assistant director of placement and career planning at the 
Westwood school. She said the increase means companies will be offering a 
bumper crop of professional, full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 So why are seniors so downcast? "It sometimes takes longer to get the word out 
to students, to have that optimism filter down to them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the jobs offered this year will be down more than 30% from 
pre-recession levels. And others say the jobs awaiting this year's graduates 
include a larger share of part-time, temporary, sales-related or commission 
work than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you conduct an analytical look of who the employers were that were coming, 
there was a strong tilt toward sales and marketing kinds of occupations, and it 
was harder to find the high-paying, high-powered jobs that used to be 
associated with the defense industry and . . . biotechnology," said Neil 
Murray, whose career center at UC San Diego saw 114 companies conduct a record 
1,000-plus interviews for entry-level jobs this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of this global economic shift is not lost on this year's 
class, which is also under pressure as a new generation of graduates continues 
to redefine what work means, said Arthur Levine, a Harvard University education 
professor who has conducted a massive graduate survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm finding a generation torn between two things -- doing well and doing 
good," Levine said. "On one hand, this is a generation that's decided it 
doesn't want to be Donald Trump or Ivan Boesky. But on the other hand, they've 
decided that the thought of being Mother Teresa isn't all that appealing, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of Levine's research -- which compares the graduating classes of 
1993 and 1978 -- found that the generation shaped by the fall of the Berlin 
Wall, the Challenger explosion and the Rodney G. King beating is less selfish 
and more optimistic about society as a whole than were the children of 
Watergate, the Arab oil embargo and the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also found that today's graduates are a cynical, scared bunch too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The questions they always ask when you get to the focus groups are: 'Is there 
going to be a future for me? Are jobs going to be available?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus mental health officials say that these worries are stressing out many 
college students, possibly contributing to the sharp increase in depression and 
other psychological ills over the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of psychological emergencies has jumped 54% in the last 10 years on 
campuses of 10,000 students or more, according to a recent University of 
Maryland survey of 250 counseling centers. On smaller campuses, emergency calls 
have jumped 26%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no way to prove what's causing this, "some of the depression 
is anticipatory" as students move closer to graduation and to the reality of 
fighting for jobs and making less than their parents, said Teresa Branch, 
president of the Assn. of University and College Counseling Center Directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The palpable Angst provided grist for a series of "Doonesbury" comic strips 
last month lampooning the value of a college degree. In one panel, graduates in 
robes and mortarboards react to the mention of the employer of choice by 
shouting "Gap! Gap! Gap!" 
</P>
<P>
 In his address to UCLA students last month, President Clinton chuckled at the 
comic strip's dark humor and characterized it as inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a series of random campus interviews paints a much bleaker picture, 
especially for liberal arts graduates such as Aaron Wilkes, 25, who graduated 
cum laude from USC with a bachelor's degree in political science. 
</P>
<P>
 After the May 8 ceremony, Wilkes -- married with a 17-month-old son -- began 
jotting down his thoughts on the graduation program. "I wrote that I felt 
skepticism," said Wilkes, who has been accepted to law school. "I felt kind of 
like, 'Was it worth it? Is (the degree) going to lead me anywhere?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jay San-Martin, a finance senior and Cal State Long Beach student body 
president, said he knows students who are going on to grad school, either to 
put off repaying student loans or because they believe a bachelor's degree is 
not enough these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the general feeling that, 'Damn, now that I've gotten here, the goal 
seems to be pushed away one step further,' " he said. "It's like a carrot in 
front of the mule." 
</P>
<P>
 Darby Ann Morrisroe, a senior in political science at UC Davis and the 
system's student regent, is just as glum. "Most of my peers are not looking 
forward to graduation at all because they have to move back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really the only option for a significant number of my friends," said 
Morrisroe, who is seeking a legislative internship in Sacramento before going 
to graduate school. "There are no jobs. Absolutely no jobs. Except for retail 
positions or waitressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford economics major Lawrence Baeck, 21, decided not to delay his quest to 
land a job as a management consultant or investment banker. Thirty first-round 
job interviews later, his reward was a solitary offer -- from Ernst & Young, 
where he interned last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it would be this tough," he said. "I thought I was pretty damn 
qualified with a Stanford diploma and rather good grades." 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of the lucky ones. Luu and his UCLA roommate, economics major Edmund 
Velasquez, have invented a game to poke fun at their as-yet futile searches for 
jobs. When either receives what looks like a rejection letter in the mail, he 
throws the envelope up in the air to watch it float. The object: Guess how many 
pages of bad news are inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go into my interviews now with a pessimistic attitude because you don't 
fall so hard," said Velasquez, who skipped Clinton's upbeat speech at UCLA 
because he was interviewing to be a store manager for Target. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not get the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to this story were Times campus correspondents Laura A. Galloway 
at USC, Marina Dundjerski at UCLA and Rajiv Chandrasekaran at Stanford.

DISNEY'S LOST AND FOUND; TALES OF MISSING CHILDREN HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To 9-year-old Noemi Rodriquez, Disneyland wasn't such a small world after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely 4 feet tall, the elementary school student from Janitzio, Mexico, 
remembered staring up at the 147-foot-high Matterhorn on a recent sunny 
afternoon. When she dropped her gaze to look for her teachers and classmates, 
they had vanished into a sea of Magic Kingdom visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 She was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriquez is one of scores of children who are separated from their parents or 
adult supervisors every day at one of Southern California's largest tourist 
attractions. With summer season bringing in bigger crowds to the world-famous 
park, the numbers of lost children can climb into the hundreds, Disney 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is traumatic for adults and children alike, the experience is also 
tough on the Disneyland employees who try to soothe the lost kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get kicked. We get thrown up on," said Ginger, who does her best to calm 
youngsters at the park's lost children facility, a holding station where 
younger children are kept until a parent or chaperon arrives. (As a matter of 
policy, Disneyland does not permit the release of the last names or other 
personal information about park employees.) "The poor little things get so 
panicky," she said. "It breaks your heart to see them this way." 
</P>
<P>
 But image-conscious Disney officials are quick to point out that there is 
always a happy ending to their lost boy and girl stories. Unlike the Lost Boys 
in Never-Never Land, a vast majority of lost children at Disneyland are 
reunited with adults within a few minutes, officials say. And in its 34-year 
history, Disney has never failed to reunite children with their parents or 
chaperons before the park closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never lost a child at Disneyland," said Verna, another worker in the 
lost children facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a perfect record may reassure parents, it unfortunately offers little 
comfort to a frightened child such as Noemi Rodriquez. In tears after realizing 
her predicament, Noemi was quickly spotted by two park employees, who combed 
the immediate area for her group of 40 classmates and eight teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, such a search usually turns up the child's guardian within 15 
minutes, park officials say. But in Noemi's case, it did not. 
</P>
<P>
 She was brought to the lost children facility, just off Main Street. Had she 
been 12 or older, Noemi would have been escorted to the park's City Hall 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, youngsters can play with toys, read Disney books or watch 
television (the Disney Channel, of course) as they wait to be picked up. Housed 
in a small, quiet room, the air-conditioned facility also has a VCR, a pair of 
comfortable sofas and a handful of chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, as many as 30 children are sent to the facility each day. 
On a recent Fourth of July -- traditionally the busiest day of the year at 
Disneyland -- more than 200 children were in and out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just chaos," said Verna, a great-grandmother who is experienced in 
comforting youngsters at the facility. "Thank goodness we haven't had another 
day like that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney chooses older women to staff the facility in hopes the motherly figures 
will help soothe troubled children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a sexist thing," said Disney spokeswoman Pam Espinosa. "From our 
observations, children seem more comfortable with the grandmotherly types." 
</P>
<P>
 In Noemi's case, the strategy seemed to work. Although separated by language, 
the little girl appeared to be comforted by Verna, whose eyes welled up with 
tears as she embraced the sobbing child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so horrible," Verna told the girl. "Everything is going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 After about an hour, news came that a teacher from Noemi's school had been 
spotted by an alert employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so happy," said her teacher, Eduardo Cisneros, giving Noemi a hug. "We 
are responsible for her. Thank you. Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, parents and adults berate themselves for allowing children to 
escape their supervision, officials say. Several parents refused to talk about 
their experience, fearing that it would make them appear irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a neglectful parent," said one mother who headed off toward 
Tomorrowland after being reunited with her child. 
</P>
<P>
 But park officials tell parents not to blame themselves. With an 86-acre park 
and tens of thousands of visitors each day, combined with the park's excitement 
and distractions, separations can occur easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them not to be too hard on themselves," Espinosa said. "The park can 
be overwhelming, especially on a first visit." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Kevin Stewart from Hesperia found it easy enough to get lost. 
Kevin remembered standing with his mother in Toontown. Then the Jolly Trolley 
went rolling by and he lost her. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin, who admitted that this was the second time he had been lost in two 
years, seemed to take his sidetracked status in stride. He spent his time 
assembling jigsaw puzzles, playing with Legos and inquiring how he might 
install a laser "like the one in Star Tours" in his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 After about 45 minutes, Kevin's mother, Sylvia Stewart, showed up. Smiles lit 
up both their faces and they embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went around the ghost house and you weren't there," said Kevin, who was 
supposed to wait at the Haunted Mansion for his mother in case they split up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have just missed you," said Sylvia, 32, clutching her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, come on," replied the boy, tiring of the reunion and eager to go to Star 
Tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Separation from a child at the park can be a trying experience for parents and 
chaperons. Robert McCollum, a truck driver from Las Vegas, had a scare when he 
could not find his companion's 8-year-old daughter, Carrie White. The 
second-grader disappeared near Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was praying, 'God, Jesus, find her,' " said McCollum, 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Frantic for nearly an hour, McCollum finally got word that Carrie was safe at 
the lost children facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "They found her. I don't know how they did it, but they did," said McCollum, 
holding Carrie's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a happy ending," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what you'd expect at the happiest place on earth.

ON CALIFORNIA: PALE RIDER REDUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He drifted out from the Texas plains. He was a tall, thin man with high 
cheekbones and pale blue eyes. He squinted a lot. He carried his money in a 
bag. It was a big, big bag, and it bore this inscription: "Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 People learned not to ask the stranger what this meant. He was not pleased by 
suggestions that he was just another rich son of an oil tycoon, out chasing 
fancies and piddling away daddy's hard-earned fortune. He preferred to believe 
he had played no small role in building the family pot. 
</P>
<P>
 One day he rode into Santa Barbara, as orderly and old-fashioned a community 
as can be found in California. On a lively night, it might be called staid. 
Well, Santa Barbara was in for some excitement now. Shake hands, the stranger 
told the townsfolk, with your new congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 They laughed at this upstart, called him a carpetbagger. He reached for the 
moneybag. And a short time later he was on his way to Washington. He left 
California pretty much as he had come -- a stranger without a tan. He had, 
however, taught the Old Guard in Santa Barbara a couple lessons in the New 
Politics. Like, never laugh at an outsider. And never, ever laugh at money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not much is known about how he spent his time in Washington. He was only there 
a year or so, and then he was back. The House of Representatives had not 
scratched his itch. Shake hands, Michael Huffington Jr. told California in his 
toned-down Texas twang, with your new You-Ess Senator. 
</P>
<P>
 They had laughed at him again, at first. Then he went $5 million deep into the 
moneybag. Now he is the GOP nominee, hurtling through the San Joaquin Valley on 
a campaign bus. It rolls down California 99 past parched grasslands and auto 
wrecking yards and abandoned hot dog stands shaped like giant oranges. To a 
native it is ugly and familiar and thus beautiful. Huffington barely looks out 
the window. By now questions about whether he knows California well enough to 
represent it seem to bore him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God," he says, "how long does it take to get to know a place?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same with the wealth issue. He doesn't believe voters care how much 
of his own money he will spend -- $5 million, $10 million, $15 million, 
"enough." The issue, he insists, is Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Although he has been 
on more than one federal payroll, Huffington intends to paint himself as the 
Washington outsider and his opponent as a government insider, a hack. And thus, 
as so much dead meat. It's nothing personal. "Is she a nice lady?" he says. 
"Sure she is. But there are a lot of nice people in the world." He smiles, and 
squints. 
</P>
<P>
 To her credit, Feinstein does not seem to be laughing. Maybe people finally 
are wising up a bit about Huffington. He won't sneak up on her as easily as the 
others. Huffington understands this particular fight will be tough. Feinstein 
packs a pretty mean pocketbook herself. In fact, Huffington explains, he ran in 
part simply because no other Republican could beat her. No one else had the 
name recognition, or at least the money needed to buy the name recognition -- 
"except maybe Clint Eastwood." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is Eastwood, of course, who so often plays the stranger from hell or High 
Lonesome in spaghetti Westerns. That, though, is the movies. Huffington has 
cast himself in the pale rider role for real. He has come to California to take 
a Senate seat, and the self-appointed keepers of political protocol can howl 
all they want about fair play and decency. He aims to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Well, because behind that hard squint, behind that pile of Texas oil 
patch money, behind all that naked ambition, there ticks within Michael 
Huffington a proverbial heart of gold. "Most business people don't want to be 
involved in politics," he says. "They don't want to spend their money. They 
want to keep it." Not Huffington. No sir. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason he wants to be U.S. senator, he says, is that he's a born altruist. 
He wants to teach the nation how to give again. Social programs simply do not 
work. Neighbors must learn again to help neighbors. The federal government must 
"get out of the way." He's here to light a fire of volunteerism -- not because 
he wants to cut loose the poor, not because voters always will rally around 
promises of lower taxes. Because he wants to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so swears the stranger. It's an appealing notion, however fanciful, and if 
he can persuade enough people he's sincere, Huffington might well be 
California's next senator. And he has brought along a powerful tool for 
persuading people. He keeps it in a big, big bag.

170 SLAUGHTERED BY RWANDAN MILITIA, ESCAPED PRIESTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Hutu militiaman who boasted he was without pity rounded up 170 people hiding 
in a Roman Catholic church and took them off to slaughter, two priests who 
escaped said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The priests spoke to reporters moments after reaching the rebel-held section 
of Kigali, Rwanda's divided capital. They said they saw the dead bodies of only 
10 of the people who had been taken Friday from the church but presumed the 
others met the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us many times, 'We will kill your people,' " the Rev. Otto Mayer 
said of the government-trained militiamen. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 200,000 to 500,000 people have died since Rwanda's civil war 
erupted anew in April, most of them minority Tutsis murdered by militiamen from 
the majority Hutu ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hutu government does not appear to have any real control over the 
militiamen, who roam army-controlled areas at will, throwing up roadblocks and 
menacing everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are a power unto themselves," the Rev. Henri Blanchard said of 
the militias. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of the ethnic bloodshed, the mostly Tutsi rebels have been fighting to 
overthrow the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer, 47, a German, and Blanchard, 58, of France, said they had been trapped 
in their church-school complex with about 250 people since April 7 -- the day 
after Rwanda's Hutu president was killed in a mysterious plane crash, 
reigniting the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time, nobody suspected there was anybody in the church. But there 
were so many children making noise that eventually word got out. 
</P>
<P>
 The priests blame a militiaman called Kiginge for the slaughter of the Tutsis 
in the church. "Know that I have no pity," they said he told them. 
</P>
<P>
 He led a group of his men to the church and said he wanted to "evacuate" the 
people inside. The priests became suspicious when he said he intended to take 
the adults away first. 
</P>
<P>
 When Blanchard refused to open the door, a militiaman tossed a tear-gas 
grenade inside, forcing the people out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer ran to a nearby Rwandan army headquarters and begged for help but was 
refused. As he ran back, a mortar round landed nearby and he suffered shrapnel 
wounds to the left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 After the people were taken away on trucks, the priests fled with the local 
city councilor for the district. As they drove up the street they saw 
militiamen dumping bodies onto the street from one of the trucks. The bodies 
had to be dragged away so the priests' car could pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard said he had tried frantically to get his charges evacuated but 
succeeded only in getting some of the children out of an orphanage near the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. force in Rwanda, with only 450 men and little equipment, does not 
have the capacity to force itself into a hostile area and extract threatened 
civilians.

RUSSIA UNVEILS PLAN TO CRACK DOWN ON ORGANIZED CRIME; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
ESCALATING VIOLENCE PROMPTS MEASURES. THEY INCLUDE RETURN OF EX-KGB'S SPECIAL 
INVESTIGATORS SQUAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after President Boris N. Yeltsin demanded that Russia be cleansed of its 
"criminal filth," the nation's top law enforcement officials announced a 
$2.6-billion program Saturday to crack down on organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The move follows a bloody spring of bombings, hijackings, drive-by shootings, 
paid assassinations of business leaders and unrelenting corruption that have 
undermined Russians' fragile confidence in their 3-year-old government. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that crime has reached "catastrophic dimensions," the officials 
promised a series of countermeasures, including posting police escorts on 
trains to protect them from bandits; allowing witnesses to give anonymous 
testimony against accused mobsters, and adopting sweeping revisions to Russia's 
Soviet-era criminal code. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the steps are likely to alarm civil rights advocates, including the 
resurrection of the former KGB's squad of 700 to 800 special investigators and 
the creation of a new unit of elite crime fighters under the control of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service, one of two successor agencies to the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian intelligence services had deliberately been denied such functions 
after the dreaded KGB was dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, with crime and corruption rivaling economic hardship as 
Yeltsin's most serious political liability, the president has made it clear 
that he wants action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime has become the scourge of Russia," Yeltsin said at a news conference 
Friday. "Criminal forces are trying to take control of key positions in the 
economy and even make inroads into politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said he will hold Interior Minister Viktor F. Yerin and Federal 
Counterintelligence Service chief Sergei V. Stepashin personally responsible 
for winning the war on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, in a rare show of cooperation, Yerin and Stepashin jointly 
announced the new anti-crime program along with Justice Minister Yuri K. 
Kalmykov, acting Prosecutor General Alexei Ilyushenko and deputy head of the 
National Security Council Vladimir Rubanov. 
</P>
<P>
 But the officials offered only tentative comments on how the new crackdown 
will differ from previous, unsuccessful efforts to curb crime and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the role of the new "directorate of active operations," Stepashin 
responded, "When it begins to function, you will learn about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials did promise a sweeping revision of the criminal code to close 
some of the loopholes in the Soviet-era legal system. A draft law has been 
approved by the government and will be submitted later this month to the Duma, 
or lower house of Parliament, for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law would for the first time allow prosecution of those who plan or 
order crimes, making it easier to target mob bosses who leave the dirty work to 
their subordinates. And police will be allowed to try to infiltrate criminal 
groups, a tactic that is now forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our legislation is hopelessly outdated," Yerin said. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of isolation, Russian law enforcement is now eager to learn from 
other countries that have more experience in combatting organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's anarchic new economy and its archaic banking, bookkeeping, taxation 
and legal systems have created fertile conditions for money-laundering, drug 
trafficking, racketeering and theft of state property through abuse of a 
massive privatization program. 
</P>
<P>
 But what most disturbs Russians is the violent crime that has burst into the 
streets of once-serene Moscow and St. Petersburg. Last week, for example, a car 
bomb exploded in downtown Moscow, injuring the head of the LogoVAZ auto 
manufacturer and killing his driver. Six passersby were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't believe this is happening in Moscow in broad daylight," said 
Lyudmilla V. Sardzheveladze, 80, whose living room was carpeted in shattered 
glass from the explosion, which blew out six stories of windows in her 
apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 A Moscow resident since 1939, she said the only other bomb she has ever seen 
was dropped near her home by the Germans during World War II. "When I heard 
this explosion, my first thought was, 'They're bombing us again!' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are also concerned about the criminalization of the Russian 
economy and the links that Russian organized crime groups have formed with 
fellow gangsters in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 At Russia's invitation, the FBI plans to open a branch office in Moscow next 
month. Yerin said the FBI and Russian law enforcement officials already have 
about 30 joint investigations under way.

SWEDISH ARMY OFFICER SHOOTS 7 TO DEATH; SCANDINAVIA: POLICE SAY ACCUSED 
ASSAILANT WAS APPARENTLY DRUNK. CRIME IS CALLED MOST VIOLENT IN NATION'S MODERN

<P>
 An army officer killed seven people with an assault rifle in a central Swedish 
town early Saturday in what police called the worst violent crime in modern 
Swedish history. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of those killed were young women serving in an army auxiliary unit and 
had been on a one-week course at the base where the gunman was stationed, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old gunman was captured after a shootout with police and he 
confessed, police said. He was hospitalized with a gunshot wound in the hip. 
</P>
<P>
 His name was not released, but police said he apparently was drunk at the time 
of the killings in a park in Falun, an industrial and winter resort town about 
145 miles northwest of Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence of the attack was jarring in Sweden, which has 120 to 150 
reported murders a year. Police said the only similar killing they could recall 
was when a gunman killed one person in 1992 in the central town of Mora. 
</P>
<P>
 A sixth woman was wounded Saturday and was hospitalized in good condition, 
said police spokesman Karl-Ivar Nilsson. He said the women all were about 20 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 They were walking home from a discotheque when they were shot about 2:30 a.m., 
Swedish television reported. Two men who were passing by were also killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an execution," said police spokesman Bertil Jansson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This incident is of the type that we unfortunately cannot protect ourselves 
from," Minister of Defense Anders Bjorck said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The army said the gunman was a second lieutenant at the Falun army base. 
</P>
<P>
 Army spokesman Tage Johansson told the national news agency, TTB, that all 
army officers are issued weapons. It was unclear how the gunman got his weapon 
past guards at the army base. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst death toll in a single attack in modern Swedish history, 
according to the National Swedish Investigation Department, Sweden's federal 
police.

FRUSTRATIONS MOUNT AS PLO LEADERSHIP BEGINS PAYING THE PRICE FOR AUTONOMY; 
MIDEAST: LACK OF CASH PROVOKES ANGER, INFIGHTING AMONG SOME OFFICIALS. ARAFAT 
REMAINS THE ONLY REAL DECISION MAKER.

 To understand some of the seeds of the looming crisis in Palestinian lands, 
one need go no farther than a few sunny villas in this North African seaside 
city that is the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suburb of Menzah, a new office for the Palestinian Economic Council for 
Development and Reconstruction is being installed behind the PLO political 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 New chairs and desks are being hauled in, and the head of the political 
department, Farouk Kaddoumi, is insisting on signing every check, every 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, in the suburb of Mutuelleville, the general manager of PECDAR, 
Ahmed Suleiman Khoury, who is also the PLO's new economy minister, sits in the 
main office of the PLO economic department. No checks or contracts here: 
Khoury, feuding with the political department, has not had anything to do with 
PECDAR -- which he created -- in two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is meeting with a delegation of 
U.S. senators. Looking pale and tired, Arafat angrily proclaims that he is not 
going home to Palestine if he does not start getting some money from the 
international community. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatened with a cash crisis that has left officials urgently begging the 
world for donations to keep the new autonomous areas afloat, PLO headquarters 
slips alternately into gloom, infighting, euphoria and desperation as Arafat 
prepares to launch his historic trip to Jericho and as the PLO, in exile for a 
generation, careens toward its rendezvous with destiny in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The surrealistic landscape was perhaps best illustrated in the office of one 
of Arafat's top advisers, who exploded in irritation recently when shown a 
newspaper headline about a Palestinian civil servant in Jericho, so far unpaid, 
who said he was eating by gathering bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what?" he boomed. "There are 350 kinds of bananas in Jericho. If you go to 
Indonesia, it is the main food of the population. So why is it strange if a 
Palestinian eats bananas?" 
</P>
<P>
 To believe that there is a hint of the let-them-eat-bananas motif to all of 
this -- many Palestinians in the occupied territories, frustrated at Tunis' 
slowness in getting the new administration working, are sure of it -- is to 
miss the air of mounting rage here among PLO officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe that they made the dance-with-the-devil step toward peace with 
Israel, only to be left twisting in the wind when it came time to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody will pay. What can we do? Sit here and cry?" a frustrated Khoury, 
popularly known as Abu Alaa, asked in his office recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Palestinian policeman who is in Gaza, and his family in Jordan, how will he 
continue to serve the interests of the people while he is not sure his family 
will be able to have their dinner?" Khoury asked. "I wonder. I'm afraid. If 
this situation continues . . . it will be a catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 International donors at a meeting Friday in Paris pledged $42 million in 
start-up costs for Palestinian self-rule, an amount the World Bank said will 
keep the new Palestinian Authority afloat at least through August. But it was 
only a little more than half what the PLO had sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors have channeled much of their early aid toward specific projects and 
have held back on flexible cash aid in the face of questions over PECDAR's 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 With the PLO's history of corruption, Arafat's iron grip at the helm of PECDAR 
has worried some. So has the feuding between Abu Alaa and Kaddoumi, who is the 
deputy chairman of PECDAR but who has no connections to the economic department 
or credentials as an economist. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say it is a conflict of interest to have a political official signing 
checks and overseeing the authority at the same time. And coordinating 
financial institutions have been slow to get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been nominated as minister of economy and commerce. For this portfolio, 
I don't know how to run it," Khoury complained. "I should employ some expert 
people. I should rent an office place in the occupied territories. But from 
where? I don't know how. There is no money. I look to the sky, and nothing 
comes from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even more, I don't know what will be the relationship between the Palestinian 
Authority and the PECDAR. I can't imagine that we will have an economic 
department and a PECDAR and a finance department too? There will be three 
administrations, and there is danger in such a situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies seeking contracts with the new Palestinian administration have been 
bypassing the PECDAR office in the occupied territories in droves and doing 
what they have always done: flocking to the Tunisian capital to meet with 
Arafat, who remains the only real decision maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to Arafat has become a growth industry. Faced with a growing number of 
Palestinians demanding "commissions" for winning contracts with the new 
Palestinian Authority, Arafat finally cracked down last month, ordering the 
arrest of his wife's uncle, London businessman George Hawa, and his associate, 
Moiad Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials say Hawa, who was released a few days later, would sit in the 
lobby of the Hilton Hotel in Tunis and promise contract approvals from Arafat 
for a 5% cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a big mouth, and he had no power to back it up," one senior PLO 
official scoffed. "The only power he had was he was Suha's (Arafat's wife) 
uncle. And that is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 For the West, wondering what this episode means about the PLO's determination 
to keep its finances clean, there are two possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has brought the smell of corruption rather close to Arafat himself," one 
European envoy said. "But it also means someone is trying to crack down on it." 
</P>
<P>
 "If Arafat didn't know, it's a disaster," one PLO official said of Hawa's 
alleged activities. "If he did know, it's a typhoon." 
</P>
<P>
 The fiscal uncertainty of the last few weeks has spelled a cash crisis in Gaza 
and Jericho. Before Friday's donor meeting, Khoury said the PLO had no idea 
where it would get the $6 million it needs for next month's police payroll and 
$7 million for the civil administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoury has insisted that the international community owes the fledgling 
Palestinian government a commitment for a full year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot wait like other states. We are facing severe problems. It's a 
problem of whether there will be peace or not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his meeting earlier this month with a U.S. Senate delegation headed by Sen. 
Paul Simon (D-Ill.), Arafat threatened to cancel his return to Jericho unless 
the cash started flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I won't participate in a puppet show,' " recounted one of those at 
the meeting. "He was upset, but sort of more in sorrow than in anger. He was 
depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, PLO officials say they have growing fears that the donor shortfall 
is an attempt on the part of the international community to control the PLO -- 
to trickle out the money, month by month, "as a point of pressure on the 
Palestinian Authority, to make sure we do what they want," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the recent hiring of an outside audit firm and the passage of a new 
set of bylaws for PECDAR, at least assuring minimum accountability, the United 
States has begun urging donors to turn on the financial tap. Friday's meeting 
was an indication that the taps, though slow, may finally be opening up. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Palestinian chief delegate Nabil Shaath said the $42 
million would be enough to get things moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we did not cover all our requirements, but you can't get everything 
you want at one go. We were looking for $70 million, but that's a good batting 
average," Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them it costs so much less to make a success story than to bail people 
out of a catastrophe," Shaath added. 
</P>
<P>
 A Western diplomat in Tunis said: "I think everyone realizes the guy (Arafat) 
has got to be helped. Because if he goes and the whole thing falls apart, then 
everybody loses." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a mood of irritation at Arafat's headquarters, where advisers say 
they are frankly sick of people wringing their hands over cash crises and 
blaming the PLO for incompetent administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "What crisis?" one senior Arafat adviser shouted. "So we are penniless? We 
have had a cash crisis for the past three years, and who was paying any 
attention? There are people here who already haven't received their salaries 
for months. It's high time the donors start sending money if they want to solve 
the crisis instead of always talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has tentatively set his departure for Jericho for the second half of 
June and has ordered the closing of most PLO offices in Tunis by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, PLO officials say the key question remains the issue of security. 
And they wonder if the safety of Arafat and his accompanying ministers can be 
guaranteed by the new Palestinian police force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he will be able to go back," one PLO official said. "The man 
has been sentenced to death in Gaza and Jericho." 
</P>
<P>
 The official added: "Arafat, when he goes back, will be face to face with his 
people and his police at the same time. I remember (former Egyptian President 
Anwar) Sadat, one of his soldiers killed him. So I don't know, a Palestinian 
policeman who hasn't got his salary for five months, how is he going to behave? 
And his family back in Algiers with nothing? Not even money to buy food?" 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's top aides exude confidence about the return. 
</P>
<P>
 "This mentality of lamentation must be stopped," one senior adviser said. 
"Security shouldn't play any role. This is our country. Whether security is 
good or bad, this is our country, and he has to deal with it. When he goes 
back, there will be three months of festivities. At least. And after the three 
months, there is hard labor."

JAPAN'S ROYAL COUPLE DOES SOME GRIPPIN' 'N' GRINNIN' IN OLD SOUTH

 Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko were greeted here Saturday with 
some Southern hospitality, Japanese-style. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister in Japan did not believe the emperor was coming here and we were 
going to see him. Now she really will not believe that I got to shake his 
hand," said Marie Hall, who left her native Japan 38 years ago after marrying 
an American. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't believe it," said Toshi Storer, who has lived in South Carolina 
for 20 years. "I'm going to call home to Japan as soon as I get home today." 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 people gathered at the Charleston Air Force Base to see the emperor 
and empress of Japan arrive for their four-hour visit to Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
 The royal couple spent about 10 minutes shaking hands and speaking with some 
of the 250 people, most of them Japanese or Japanese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect that we could see him so closely, that we could even hear his 
voice," Masaki Koide said. "It will be the only chance in my lifetime that I 
will get to see him that closely." 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor and empress flew from Charleston to Andrews Air Force Base outside 
Washington. They will be honored at a state dinner at the White House on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 They were greeted at Andrews by Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, 
and by Walter F. Mondale, the ambassador to Japan, and his wife, Joan. The 
couple was spending Saturday night with the Japanese ambassador, Takakazu 
Kuriyama. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, in Atlanta, the royal couple got a taste of Southern culture, touring 
a museum filled with Civil War relics and chatting with a Scarlett O'Hara 
impersonator. The empress loves "Gone With the Wind" and wanted to see an 
exhibit on the movie at the Atlanta History Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked me if I was wearing a corset to make my waist look smaller," said 
impersonator Melly Meadows, who presented the empress with a bouquet. She 
responded by flipping up part of her hoop skirt to show the royal couple her 
bloomers. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor and empress began a 16-day tour of the United States on Friday in 
Atlanta. They left Saturday for Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
 They are making no public comments during their tour and are acting only as 
goodwill ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
 They exchanged pleasantries but didn't address any political issues during 
meetings in Atlanta with former President Jimmy Carter and Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr.'s widow, Coretta Scott King.

CAR BOMB AT MEXICO HOTEL KILLS 5; DRUG LINK SUSPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A car packed with powerful explosives blew up outside a luxury hotel Saturday, 
killing at least five people and wounding 15. Police sources said the bombing 
may be linked to Guadalajara's drug gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camino Real Hotel was evacuated after the early morning explosion, which 
occurred as 300 guests were winding up a debutante ball for a 15-year-old girl. 
Investigators at the scene, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the girl's 
family is known to have ties to drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexico City newspaper Universal reported that police said members of the 
family of Rafael Caro Quintero, allegedly one of Mexico's most powerful drug 
traffickers, were attending the party inside the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Body parts were found up to 300 yards away. Norma Leticia Gutierrez, deputy 
director of the state forensic service, said that pieces of the bodies were so 
scattered that her team had been able to piece together only two bodies, 
neither of which was identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast cracked hotel walls, shattered windows up to 20 blocks away and 
destroyed more than a dozen cars. Blood was smeared on the ballroom walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and state officials said the automobile was packed with 10 to 22 pounds 
of plastic explosives and may have been detonated by remote control. Enrique 
Hoyos Medina, an expert at the state attorney general's office, said the 
explosives were a commercial type sold mainly to mining companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalajara, 175 miles northwest of Mexico City, has been the scene of much 
drug-related violence. The city's Roman Catholic archbishop was killed in the 
cross-fire of a drug-related shootout at the local airport last year. 
</P>
<P>
 No one claimed responsibility for Saturday's blast, and the government said it 
had no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told the official Mexican news agency Notimex that four people were 
seen leaving the car just before the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 The car, a 1993 Mercury Grand Marquis, was parked across from the hotel's main 
entrance, which was blown away by the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast was the latest in a series of violent incidents that, although 
unrelated, have shaken Mexico. They include a New Year's Day uprising in the 
south and the March 23 assassination of a presidential candidate.

 A suspended police officer was convicted Saturday of shooting three teen-agers 
to death, including one who had filed a brutality lawsuit against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Robert Sabetta Jr., 25, walked into a car repair shop on 
April 13, 1993, and shot four teen-agers because he feared for his job at the 
Foster Police Department.The fourth teen-ager was injured and another man 
escaped harm by hiding under a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed were Frank Sherman, 16, his brother, Charles Sherman III, 17, and their 
friend, Jeremy Bullock, 19. The shootings occurred two weeks after Sabetta was 
indicted on a charge of smashing Frank Sherman's mouth with a flashlight during 
a traffic stop. Police believe that Sabetta wanted revenge for the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big load off of me, off of all of us," Joshua Bullock, the 21-year-old 
brother of Jeremy, said of the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury reached the verdict in about four hours, and Judge Dominic Cresto 
scheduled sentencing for July 20. John Cicilline, Sabetta's defense lawyer, 
said he would appeal the convictions.

DOLE VOWS TO FIGHT EMPLOYER MANDATE; HEALTH: THE PRESIDENT IS UPBEAT ABOUT 
PASSAGE OF REFORMS THIS YEAR. BUT GOP LEADER SAYS HE WILL BLOCK ANY BILL 
REQUIRING FIRMS TO PAY FOR WORKERS' COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As President Clinton urged Americans on Saturday to press a slow-moving 
Congress to enact universal health care coverage this year, the Senate's 
leading Republican threatened to block any plan requiring businesses to pay for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 In his weekly radio address, Clinton declared that major health care reform is 
"closer than ever before," and he commended the work of Democratic Sens. Edward 
M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, who are 
moving legislation through their respective committees. He said everyone needs 
the security of health insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way all of our people will be secure is when every American knows 
that whether they lose their job, change jobs, move their home, get sick, get 
injured or just grow old, their health care will be there," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said in a speech at the 
Republican National Committee's Northeast regional meeting in Boston that he 
has "reached a point" where he was prepared to block passage of health care 
reform and put the issue at the center of this fall's political campaigns -- if 
the Democrats insist on requiring employers to pay for their workers' 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said he wanted to explore bipartisan compromises but acknowledged that 
Republicans have been unable so far to settle on a single plan. He said more 
than 90% of Americans, however, could be covered without the so-called employer 
mandates and suggested he would not yield on that Democrat-favored feature. 
</P>
<P>
 With time running short as Congress eyes adjournment for the fall elections, 
Dole could orchestrate a GOP filibuster in the Senate or use his position on 
the Senate Finance Committee, a key panel considering health care reform, to 
block a Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements by Clinton and Dole came as five congressional committees -- 
two in the Senate and three in the House -- are running weeks behind schedule 
in crafting health care reform legislation. However, Kennedy's Labor and Human 
Resources Committee gave Clinton's program a boost last week by becoming the 
first panel to approve a bill that meets the President's basic goal of 
guaranteeing health care coverage for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said in his speech that the Kennedy plan -- which would finance universal 
health care coverage through a modified employer mandate -- could never pass 
Congress. "That's as far as it's going to go," Dole said of the committee's 
11-6 approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Some key House Democrats, notably Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John 
D. Dingell of Michigan, whose panel is deadlocked on health care, have been 
taking a position similar to Dole's -- that Democrats should take the issue 
back to voters in the midterm elections this year and try again in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, however, said he remains optimistic about substantial reforms in the 
near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "For weeks we've been told that health care reform is dead, that America will 
continue to be the only advanced country in the world that spends more than 
anybody else on health care and does less with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the truth is, in spite of all the naysayers, our nation is closer than 
ever before to achieving a goal that President Truman set after World War II -- 
real health care security for every family." 
</P>
<P>
 Asserting that "half-measures, quick fixes and Band-Aid-style reforms" won't 
accomplish the task, Clinton said those who advocate them "say they're 
reforming the health care system, but they fail to provide every American with 
the ironclad guarantee that they'll have private health insurance that can 
never be taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's cover everyone," the President urged. "Let's get the job done this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton echoed the President, telling a meeting of 
the American Nurses Assn. in San Antonio on Saturday that "America does not 
need half-baked, half-hearted reforms. We need real reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady, who headed the Administration's health care reform task force, 
called on Congress not to become "mired in name-calling and gridlock" and not 
to arrange compromises that would equal less than universal health care 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a time for incrementalism," she said, warning the nurses that 
continued layoffs in the health care industry "will only get worse if we do not 
reform the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the House minority whip, said it was 
"about even money" whether health care legislation would be enacted this year. 
But he predicted that Clinton's plan would fail to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the country wants the Clinton health plan," Gingrich said on 
CNN's "Evans & Novak," labeling it as "a big-government, big-tax, 
big-bureaucracy bill." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Clinton health plan is going to pass," he said. "And I 
think they ought to drop their left-wing ideas and agree to work with us in a 
bipartisan manner."

D.C.'S MAYOR SEEKS REELECTION BID TO IMPROVE CITY'S FISCAL, SOCIAL WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sharon Pratt Kelly, the first black woman elected mayor of a major city, 
announced her bid for reelection Saturday, saying she needs more time to 
fulfill her mandate of bringing the District of Columbia's myriad social and 
fiscal problems under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a career politician, but I am asking you today for four more years," 
Kelly told an audience of 1,200 supporters, political allies and government 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her announcement at the historic Lincoln Theater was interrupted briefly by a 
small pocket of demonstrators who chided Kelly on what they said was her 
failure to stem the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were shouted down by chants of "Four more years," and hustled out of 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry, I'm tough enough to deal with it," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her priorities include further efforts to improve the city's fiscal 
situation and ensure that more government and private resources reach the 
city's ever-growing underclass. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly also said she was not discouraged by polls commissioned by her two main 
rivals for the Democratic nomination -- At-Large Councilman John Ray and former 
mayor Marion Barry, now a city councilman -- that show her trailing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one poll that matters, and that's the one we will win on Sept. 
13," the day of the primary, she said to cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly reiterated that she would avoid personal attacks on her rivals, who in 
some cases have stridently questioned her ability to manage the city's finances 
and further reduce the 42,000-worker bureaucracy.

AFTER LOSING BABY JESSICA, MICHIGAN PAIR ADOPTS BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The couple who lost Baby Jessica in court has adopted a newborn boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan and Roberta DeBoer brought Casey home Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wonderful news, and they sound happy," said Annie Rose, a friend and 
the family's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The DeBoers declined to be interviewed Saturday, or to disclose details of the 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's long, unsuccessful fight in court for the girl they named Jessica 
broke hearts across the country. She was returned to her biological parents 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The DeBoers, who have no other children, still grieve over the loss of the 
child they loved for 2 1/2 years, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casey is a great joy, in the little time they've had him. But Jessie will 
always be a part of their lives, and she will always be their daughter," Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jessie is still very much in their thoughts and prayers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Baby Jessica began in 1991, when the girl was put up for adoption 
and the DeBoers took temporary custody of her. They took her from Cedar Rapids, 
Iowa, where she was born, to their Michigan home. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, the biological mother changed her mind and revealed that she had 
deliberately named the wrong man as the father on the adoption papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cara Clausen told her ex-boyfriend, Dan Schmidt, that he had fathered her 
child, and he began seeking custody of the girl. The DeBoers fought to keep the 
baby, waging legal battles in Iowa and Michigan. Meantime, Clausen and Schmidt 
married in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The DeBoers lost their final battle last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court 
refused to hear their appeal of a lower court order requiring them to return 
the brown-eyed, dark-haired child to the Schmidts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 2, the screaming toddler was carried from the DeBoers' home and 
whisked away to the Iowa home of her biological parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schmidts, who renamed their child Anna and now have a second daughter, 
said earlier this year that the girl has adjusted well.

TEEN-AGE PATIENT GETS OK TO STOP TRANSPLANT DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the state's objections, a teen-age transplant patient won a judge's 
permission Saturday to return home and stop taking the medicine that could 
prolong his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito Agrelo, 15, who has undergone two liver transplants, said the 
anti-rejection drugs gave him headaches and made him irritable. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother said he might live only a month more without the drugs. But she 
said it would be a more comfortable life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Benny was granted exactly what he deserves," said his mother, Armanda Agrelo. 
"He will get to live his life the way he wants. There will be no forcing of 
drugs for him." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager said he had thought about the decision for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge made the right decision," he told WTVJ-TV in Miami on Saturday. "I 
should have the right to make my own decision. I'm tired of living in pain. I'd 
rather stay at home and live as close as I can to a natural life." 
</P>
<P>
 Broward County Circuit Judge Arthur Birken would not comment on the case, 
saying it was not over. 
</P>
<P>
 Jocelin McBryan, a county children's advocate, confirmed the basics of the 
order. "The state won't be telling him what to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito received his first new liver when he was 8-years-old and his second in 
December, 1992, but he decided last summer to cut back on anti-rejection 
medicine because it caused fierce headaches and irritability, common side 
effects. Last October, he quit taking the medicine all together. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more he cut back the better he felt," his brother, Frank Agrelo, said 
after a court hearing Saturday.

YOUTH COULD BE 1ST UNDER NEW RULING TO FACE MURDER CHARGES IN DEATH OF FETUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what may be the first case of its kind in California, a Fresno teen-ager 
could be charged with murder in connection with the shooting death of his 
girlfriend's fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-month fetus died Friday, a day after Ramon Orosco, 18, shot his 
14-year-old pregnant girlfriend in the back for talking with another boy, 
police said.Maria Torres was listed in extremely critical condition at Fresno's 
Valley Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Robert Freed said Orosco will be charged with murder. 
Because of a state Supreme Court ruling in May, the killing of a non-viable 
fetus can be considered murder. Previously, the court held that a murder charge 
was warranted only if the fetus was old enough to survive at birth.

NEW IDEAS ABOUT 'PEOPLE WITH NO NAME'; ENVIRONMENT: MYSTERY CLAN OF FARMERS AND 
ARTISANS THRIVED FOR A TIME, THEN VANISHED AFTER LAYING WASTE TO THEIR 
RESOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the most recently recognized examples of the environmental destruction 
caused by primitive civilizations involves a mysterious group that lived along 
the south coast of Guatemala dating back about 1,800 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporaries of the Maya and the Teotihuacan of Mexico, these farmers and 
artisans, as yet unnamed by researchers, seemingly came out of nowhere and 
established a regional civilization that thrived for 600 years. Then, having 
overused their local resources and otherwise fouled their nest, the "People 
With No Name" fragmented, fell into warfare and disappeared as mysteriously as 
they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 10 years ago, archeologists thought that this was a relatively 
insignificant group, a handful of villages that represented perhaps a colony of 
Teotihuacan or conquered vassals. 
</P>
<P>
 But major new discoveries by UC Santa Barbara archeologist Fred Bove -- 
particularly the extended urban area around the recently found city of Los 
Chatos -- are rapidly changing that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being a small, subjugated community, Bove has found, the "People With 
No Name" were a sophisticated civilization with their own styles of written 
language, art and architecture. They lived between the Maya and the 
Teotihuacan, trading with both and adopting the best features of their 
cultures. Their history, as Bove has pieced it together, is the tale of Central 
America in microcosm. 
</P>
<P>
 Bove has been working on the South Coast since the late 1970s. His first 
discovery was the city called Balberta. Occupied by the "People With No Name" 
before AD 200, it flourished briefly until it was abandoned around AD 350. 
</P>
<P>
 No signs of warfare or natural disaster remain to explain its collapse, Bove 
said. The group simply moved as mysteriously as it had appeared -- perhaps to 
nearby Los Chatos, which eventually fell into environmental ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Chatos region, explored by Bove for the first time in the late 1980s, 
is an extraordinarily large site, extending as much as five miles along the 
river. It has two highly unusual characteristics for Central American sites: It 
was not built over by subsequent civilizations, and it has apparently been 
largely untouched by looters. Bove's team, which is based at the University of 
San Carlos, has only barely begun to examine the site, but already they have 
found many unique treasures that provide insight to the lives of the "People 
With No Name." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the first sign of impending environmental disaster occurred around AD 
700 when Los Chatos' central authority fragmented and small communities began 
to exert their own authority. One indicator is the widespread appearance of 
ceremonial handball courts -- which previously have been found only at 
government centers. 
</P>
<P>
 That decentralization, according to archeologist Charles L. Redman of Arizona 
State University, may have resulted from people in outlying areas needing to 
conserve their resources and food, which had shrunk because of over-harvesting 
of trees and poor farming practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The inevitable collapse soon followed, Bove said. The ruling elite consumed 
too many resources and could no longer be supported by the underclass. "They 
polluted water reservoirs with their own refuse," Bove said. "They deforested 
large areas for their construction. The elite population . . . lost the balance 
that the elites need with the common people that support them" and the society 
collapsed in chaos. "Without waxing poetic about it, there is a lesson here for 
all of us."

ALASKA CRUISE SHIP PASSENGER DIES IN GANGWAY ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cruise ship gangway broke from its supports at a downtown dock Saturday, 
killing a tourist who fell into the water and hit her head on the side of the 
ship, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other tourists hung onto the dangling gangway for more than an hour 
while rescuers secured it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Dierker, 52, of St. Louis cracked her skull on the ship as she fell 
into Gastineau Channel, officials said. A crewman dove 30 feet into the frigid 
water and pulled the unconscious woman onto the ship, but she died at a 
hospital about 2 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other tourists were hurt, with most of the injuries reported to be minor. 
One woman broke her ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers were leaving the 257-foot Yorktown Clipper and preparing to 
head for flights home when the gangway became separated from the dock and ship. 
The 35-foot gangway was left suspended at an angle by cables connected to the 
ship's crane and ropes tied to the dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials said the accident appeared to have been caused by a 
design flaw in the load-bearing pins and brackets that connect the gangway to 
the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship, built in 1988, is owned by Clipper Cruise Line of St. Louis. With a 
capacity of 138 passengers and 37 crew members, it is one of the smaller ships 
that cruises southeast Alaska's Inside Passage.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; THE 'MODEL MILLIONAIRES'; THE NORTONS RODE THE COMPUTER 
REVOLUTION TO A STATE OF FINANCIAL BLISS. THEN THEY DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO PLAY 
-- WITH THEIR KIDS, ART AND CHARITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 It is a rare quiet day at the Santa Monica villa of computer software king 
Peter Norton and his wife, Eileen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton has recently come and gone, as have William Gray, head 
of the United Negro College Fund, a group of 800 looky-loos on a garden tour 
and the guests at a preschool fund raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nortons are hanging out at the kitchen table. Their butler, who used to 
work for Malcolm Forbes, hovers discreetly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ordinary. We'd be living in Torrance with crabgrass if it weren't for a 
bit of luck," Peter offers, sipping a Snapple. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're average. He's a programmer. I'm an elementary school teacher. It's what 
happened to us that's unusual," chimes Eileen. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened is that Peter Norton became a living legend in the software 
world, turning a $30,000 investment into multiple millions through great timing 
and technological savvy. First he created Unerase, which allowed personal 
computer users to retrieve lost data. Then he invented the Norton Utilities 
program now employed by virtually all of mankind to solve a wide range of PC 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened next is perhaps even more amazing. In 1990, after seven years in 
business -- and before his company had reached its growth potential -- the 
couple called off "the money acquisition phase" of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 He had not hit 50, she was not yet 40. Their two children weren't in 
kindergarten yet. Their wealth, estimated at between $200 million and $400 
million, was not immense by computer-biz standards. (Microsoft's Bill Gates, 
for example, is a multibillionaire.) Still, the pair decided to stop working 
and start playing. And to find ways to repay society for their good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, they share a passion for art (their private collection numbers 1,000 
pieces), for philanthropy (they will donate $2 million this year) and -- "this 
may sound sappy," Eileen warns -- for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nortons are America's model millionaires," says David Ross, director of 
the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. "If this country had even a few 
more like them, we'd be a better place." 
</P>
<P>
 Could his enthusiasm be colored by a Norton Family Foundation gift of $134,000 
-- in 1993 alone -- to the museum? 
</P>
<P>
 "Irrelevant," he says. "I've known them for years. They're warm, 
unpredictable, fearless. There's something wonderful and unusual about the fact 
that they act as a couple, that they do their philanthropy together. I get the 
feeling that as their children grow, they'll be engaged in it as well." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, set up in 1989 to benefit cultural and humanitarian causes, is 
"small potatoes" compared to those of America's wealthiest families, Peter 
says. On the other hand, it's more flexible than the big "belt and suspenders 
boards," helping the young, the new and the needy within hours or days. All 
either Norton has to say is "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Curator Simon Watson sent out 50 applications last fall for funds to bring an 
exhibition on cross-dressing from the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston 
to his alternative-space museum in New York. Only the Nortons answered in the 
affirmative. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a world view," Watson says. "They like the new, the talented, the 
offbeat and the untried." 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Decter, who asked the Nortons for $7,500 to continue publishing his New 
York-based alternative art journal, Acme, received the same response. "They 
came through, turning on a dime." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple also gives to larger art institutions and humanitarian causes. They 
sponsor admission-free Thursday nights at the Museum of Contemporary Art and 
last year gave to such groups as Big Sisters of Los Angeles, Coalition for 
Clean Air, Children of the Night, Dance Theater of Harlem, the Fund for a Free 
Africa and the Democratic Party, which received $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one could have predicted that Eileen Harris and Peter Norton would ever 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell people the story and they don't believe us," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter and his two brothers grew up in Seattle in what he calls "a real 
white-bread, white-picket fence, Ozzie-and-Harriet type of family." His father 
was an insurance sales executive, his mother a homemaker. "There was no great 
art on the walls," Peter quips. 
</P>
<P>
 During summer vacations from Reed College in Portland, Ore., he worked for an 
actuarial firm, where he learned programming. "They showed me a new IBM 1620, 
threw the manual at me, and I took to it like a duck to water." 
</P>
<P>
 After college, he spent five years in a Zen monastery in Northern California 
("Yes, I was a monk," he says, declining to elaborate) and took a series of 
conventional programming jobs. None lasted more than two years. "I get bored 
too easily," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, he was living in a small Venice apartment, working in Van Nuys and 
wondering how to meet Ms. Right. "I was seeking a black spouse," Norton says, 
"because I have always been attracted to black women. I find them gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to place a personal ad in the singles magazine Intro. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen grew up in Watts, in a household with her divorced mother, two uncles 
and a grandfather. The men worked for the postal service, her mother was a 
retail salesclerk. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hamilton High School, she commuted from home to UCLA, where she earned 
her bachelor's degree. And to USC, where she earned her master's in bilingual 
education. And after that, to a series of teaching jobs in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most parents push their kids out of the house at one point or another. But 
not my family," Eileen says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 She dated -- always African Americans -- but had yet to meet anyone exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 29 years old, working at an elementary school where there was nobody to 
meet, and all my friends were having the same problem. I was beginning to 
wonder exactly what my options were." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother urged her to listen to Dr. Toni Grant on the radio. The talk-show 
therapist mentioned the personal ads in Intro magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought a copy, said 'no way' and chucked it," Eileen says. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, she changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their ads ran in the same issue. 
</P>
<P>
 She noticed his, but didn't respond, preferring to see who would answer hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men responded. She met two, but nothing clicked. "And then there was 
Peter. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Their first date at a falafel place, now closed, in Westwood Village went so 
well that they crossed Westwood Boulevard to the Chatham restaurant, also now 
defunct, where they continued to eat and talk. 
</P>
<P>
 They dated again. And again. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1983, Peter purchased an IBM personal computer. He told Eileen 
that he wanted to quit his "nowhere job" and live off his modest savings while 
playing with the computer to see if he could "become independently employed." 
</P>
<P>
 He began by writing books and programs for the first PC owners. As mail orders 
started trickling in, he offered Eileen a job as his gofer. Bored with 
teaching, she agreed. Working in his Venice apartment, he wrote while she 
packed, labeled and mailed packages. "He was a terrible boss," she recalls. 
"You had to do things his way." 
</P>
<P>
 But they were in love, and the little business was growing. 
</P>
<P>
 They married on a Sunday morning, Nov. 27, 1983, at the Albertson Wedding 
Chapel on Wilshire at La Brea. Their families never mentioned the racial 
difference, Eileen says: "They were very happy for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within five years, they had hit the financial big-time. And Peter was bored: 
"I had done programming for so long, I'd had my fill of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurship no longer titillated him. But what else does one do with 
wealth? Peter studied the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "American wealth normally has three phases, which are usually lived out in 
three successive generations: making a fortune, using it, dissipating it," he 
says. "We wanted our life to encompass the first two phases." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple decided to spend the rest of their lives "indulging in the 
recreation of philanthropy."' 
</P>
<P>
 Norton merged his namesake firm with Symantec Corp. of Cupertino, receiving 
one-third of Symantec's stock, some of which he sold in the early '90s for 
prices varying between $20 and $47 per share. He still owns 1 million Symantec 
shares, and earns royalties for the use of his name and face on Norton 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before they had any "real money," Eileen and Peter visited art galleries. 
("What else does a couple do on a date?" she asks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Later, they focused their philanthropy on art because it was a shared interest 
and because they wanted to help local talents. "L.A. has some of the world's 
best young artists just starting careers. If no one buys . . . they have to 
stop making art and get another kind of day job," Peter says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nortons, listed by Art News magazine among the world's top 200 collectors, 
still gallery-surf on Saturdays. "We have a one-vote policy," he explains. "If 
either one of us votes for (a piece), we buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, their high-ceilinged, 15,000-square-foot house (36 phones, 10 
bedrooms, 13 baths, three playrooms, a kids' computer room . . . ) has scarcely 
a wall, table, mantel, niche or crevice unadorned by eye-popping, socially 
conscious art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't necessarily call (the art) cutting edge . . . sometimes it's just 
out on the edge . . . period," says Robert Storr, curator of painting and 
sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Storr means that as a compliment, but some in the art world question the 
erratic quality of the Nortons' acquisitions -- and suggest that their money 
has won them undue influence. "They're sincere and adventurous, but they have 
no defined taste," says one critic who requested anonymity. Another suggested 
that the couple has tried too hard and too fast to advance the careers of 
perhaps undeserving artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's ridiculous," counters Paul Schimmel, chief curator of the Museum of 
Contemporary Art. "Taste is for fashion designers and decorators, not art 
collectors. The Nortons are specialists in the area of emerging artists with 
strong political and social content." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nortons respond sensibly to criticism. For heaven's sake, the curmudgeonly 
Peter scoffs, he and Eileen are relative novices at all this. Isn't that the 
fun of it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent my life doing what I'm good at -- computer science. It's more 
interesting to do what I'm not particularly good at, what I must struggle with 
and may even be incompetent at." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Nortons own works by household-name artists (Chagall, Goya, 
Hockney), most of those pieces are in storage or on loan. Their penchant for 
the new and unusual is evident in the art they choose to live with. A quick 
reading of the computer printout itemizing their home collection reveals works 
fabricated with marijuana leaves, brown paper shopping bags, grease, hair, wire 
hangers, smoked cigarette butts, a bedpan filled with straw and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside the spiral staircase, naked light bulbs dangle from a rope attached 
to a skylight 50 feet above. The piece, by artist and AIDS activist Felix 
Gonzalez-Torres, is a family favorite, Peter says. "It looks whimsical, but it 
has to do with memory and loss, with having the bulbs burn out at different 
times. It's very much a metaphor for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Niches in a hallway contain colorful little sculptures of the Seven Dwarfs, 
prison bars in front of a painted blue sky and other visually entertaining 
pieces. Life-size deer peer out the library's French windows, their antlers 
wired to light up at night. A rug reads, "There are two things I need to watch 
for the rest of my life: My weight and my racism." And the dining room table is 
perpetually set with Lenox plates commemorating such people as Harriet Tubman, 
"for being willing to take even her husband's woman to freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 In the sun room, among objets d'art on the coffee table, a $5-million dollar 
check to the Internal Revenue Service is encased in a Lucite brick. "It was the 
largest check I ever wrote; whenever I write one for more than $1 million, I 
keep it around," Peter says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do the kids ever mess with all this art?" a visitor asks the butler. "Never," 
he replies loftily. 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, little Michael, 5, enters, twirling dervishly. He promptly loses 
control of his toy baton, scoring a direct hit on a fragile sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's inevitable when there are kids around," Eileen says later with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, a staff member maintains the art. The Nortons have no idea how 
much of it is in the house on any given day. "It changes all the time," Eileen 
says. "When we're tired of looking at one thing, we replace it with something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes, one of their two full-time curators removes a work for repair 
or for an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unexpected art is one thing. Unexpected intruders, another. As she shows a 
guest around upstairs, Eileen opens a door and literally stumbles onto a 
crouching man who, it turns out, is fixing the elaborate phone system, which 
has gone kaflooey. (The system includes a home-to-office hot line used only by 
Eileen and Peter. "It's the boss," he says when it rings.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You scared the hell out of me," Eileen tells the phone man, hand on heart. 
Then, turning to her guest, says, "You see why this house is too big for us? I 
never know who's in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Nortons believe the house, bought in 1992, was a mistake. "It's great for 
displaying the art, and it sings when there are hundreds of people around. But 
there are only four of us -- two adults and two kids. Who needs all this?" 
Eileen asks. 
</P>
<P>
 At her old house, she says, "I used to answer my own phone like a normal 
person. I can't do that here." Nor can she oversee the two maids, nanny and 
other occasional help to her satisfaction. "There are just too many." 
</P>
<P>
 In a later conversation, Eileen does confess it was she who wanted the big 
house. And it's not the only residence she has persuaded Peter to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were walking on the beach at Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, and I saw 
this white Victorian that looked like a wedding cake. 'Oh, let's get it,' I 
said." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter reminded her that they had just bid on a much larger house in the same 
community. "Well, we got them both," Eileen says. "And it's a good thing. 
Because while the big one was being renovated, we had a place to stay." The 
truth, she confides, is that the little house, now designated for summer 
guests, is much more fun to live in than the big one. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Bluffs is a summer community populated by some of East Coast's most 
successful and influential African American families.  
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it," Eileen says. "Our children look more like me than they look 
like him. They are black. But here in Santa Monica, they're in a white 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Vineyard, there are lots of black upper-middle-class families. The 
children get to see successful black people doing all the same things that 
successful white people do here. They see doctors, lawyers, bankers, artists. 
We want them to grow up knowing that black people are just as successful as 
whites, something they don't see around here. I mean, there is one other black 
child in Diana's class and none in Michael's." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nortons have chosen to live in such communities, they say, partly to 
protect Diana and Michael from the pain of racial intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's horse will be shipped to the Vineyard for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The business of maintaining and managing all this stuff is complex. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the Nortons took care of it from their bedroom. When that became 
inadequate, Peter "studied up on the history of American wealth." He was drawn 
to the concept of the family office, which flourished in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norton Family Office opened in the 1991, on the second floor of an elegant 
Santa Monica building. With a staff of 13 (including an executive director, the 
two curators, a bookkeeper who is also mayor of Santa Monica and various 
support personnel), it consolidates management of all the personal, 
philanthropic and professional activities. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical day, Peter arrives there at about 8:30, after dropping his 
daughter off at a private school. Dressed for comfort in blue oxford-cloth 
shirt and chinos, he settles into a small office that offers a long view of the 
perpetual circus on the Third Street Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought when I sold my business my time would be rather idle," he says. 
"That's why our offices are strategically placed across the street from not 
one, but two multiplex theaters, where I thought I would spend a substantial 
portion of my weekday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the reality is that I work a solid day, and then half of the evening 
after my wife goes to sleep, dealing with what the French like to call affaires 
(business)."  
</P>
<P>
 A "demon correspondent," he sends out 10,000 pieces of mail annually to 
friends and associates, he says. Most are postcards featuring his "goofy 
pictures of the family." One shows the foursome in front of Air Force One, 
which they toured the day of the infamous presidential haircut. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, he has been traveling often as his ties on the East Coast 
grow stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 He is on the board of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the California 
Institute of the Arts, both in Los Angeles. In New York, he serves on 
committees at the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum, and is on the 
board of the Whitney Museum of American Art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen drives their son to school each morning. Although she has "a huge 
closet and no budget constraints," she zips around town in white cotton 
T-shirts, pants, simple vests. "The kids wear Gap," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She gardens, plays tennis, does yoga or works on her philanthropic projects 
until the children, 5 and 6, come home. Then she chauffeurs them to their 
activities -- listed daily, along with hers, on a computer printout. 
</P>
<P>
 Her charitable work has become increasingly non-art-related. She is on the 
board of the Children's Defense Fund, in Washington, D.C, and masterminds a 
kind of think tank in Los Angeles called the Forum on Children's Issues. 
</P>
<P>
 It brings together experts from various disciplines to network on issues 
critical to children. In April, for example, a health-care forum at the Century 
Plaza hotel included Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.), Marian Wright Edelman of the 
Children's Defense Fund, L.A. Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, and a host of medical 
experts and other advocates. Eileen's staff of two Forum consultants also work 
out of the family office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Eileen and Peter see each other less now that he's not "working." 
And she admits she doesn't like it: "I tell him he's away too much, and the 
children notice the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he understands. "For a surprisingly long time we were inseparable," he 
says. "We spent 22 hours a day, day after day, week after week, together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What could go wrong with their grand life plan? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing so far, Eileen says. They have wonderful friends -- mostly the parents 
of their children's schoolmates -- good health and more than enough things. Yet 
no life is ever totally placid, she adds. Aside from struggling to find the 
right spot, physically, in which to comfortably settle, there are niggling 
problems relating to social comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We open our house to so many fund-raisers, because we want to share it. 
That's what it's here for. We have also thrown many private parties. Hundreds 
of people have been invited to our homes over the years. I'm not taking notes 
or anything, but I can count on the fingers of my hands the number of people 
who have reciprocated. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've invited so many people, and you never get an invitation for a 
drink or a cup of coffee, you realize something is amiss. I think it's because 
of me. I think if Peter had a blond, blue-eyed wife, he'd be inundated with 
invitations." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter says he's totally untroubled about the lack of invitations. In fact, he 
barely perceives a problem. "But then again, I'm white," he says with a grin, 
"which makes me less sensitive to these things." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are different from other people and we know it," Eileen says. "Not just 
different in our marriage, but in the whole way we approach the world. I guess 
it's difficult for us to find out exactly who our peers are." 
</P>
<P>
 That's understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have few equals," says the Whitney's Ross. "Not because of their money, 
but because they live their lives in active gratitude." Peter and Eileen Norton 
</P>

 Peter Quoted:  
</P>
<P>
 * On being average: "I am not a genius. I'm not even gifted. I'm just your 
garden-variety smart person." 
</P>
<P>

used to invoke the idea of people who have power and can influence or 
manipulate things. It is not a word . . . I would aspire to have applied to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 * On being restless: "If this were a cowboy movie, I'd be the drifter." 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Quoted:  
</P>
<P>
 * On having a good deal of money: "It does not buy you happiness or health or 
inner peace. But it buys you the freedom to have things, like a wonderful 
garden." 
</P>
<P>
 * On opening their home for fund-raisers: "People say, 'Oh, you're so kind.' 
They say they could never have all those hundreds of people in their yard. . . 
. It just amazes Peter and me that people are so possessive of their . . . 
grass." 
</P>
<P>

the only thing of value anyone has.";

JAMES FLANIGAN: EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP: ONE MORE WAY OF COPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is employee ownership a guide through the minefield of the American workplace 
today? "It's no panacea, but it can help if it's handled well," says Joseph 
Vittoria, chairman of Avis Inc., the "We try harder" car renter that is one of 
the most successful of employee-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Vittoria, 59, may soon get an even larger challenge in employee ownership. 
He's scheduled to become a director of the new United Airlines if an employee 
buyout of the carrier gets shareholder approval in a vote expected at the end 
of June. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, United seems a prime example of labor-management anger and 
bitterness. The buyout proposal, in which pilots, machinists and salaried 
employees would get control in return for wage and work-rule concessions, ran 
into further skepticism from a major investor last week. Vanguard Windsor Fund, 
which owns almost 10% of United parent UAL Corp., said it didn't look right to 
exchange 55% of the airline for promises to work more efficiently and give up 
hypothetical pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 United's unions, in turn, emphasized their threat to wreak Armageddon on the 
airline in the form of strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute erupted against a backdrop of concern over work in America and the 
report a week ago of a government commission, led by former Labor Secretary 
John Dunlop, that the U.S. workplace is a disaster zone of widening wage gaps 
and insecure employment. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on? Fast-paced technological change is arousing resistance and 
desperation but not traditional labor bargaining. In United's case, for 
example, the company's pension and mutual fund owners would be happy to unload 
the business if somebody would give them cash at the proposed buyout price, set 
in December, of roughly $160 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 But UAL stock currently trades at $115 a share. So investors may have to take 
promissory notes and stay with the employee-run airline if the buyout is 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees, meanwhile, know a strike of any duration would send UAL into 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and hurt them perhaps most of all. "The employees feel 
they're the only ones with a real stake in the company, their livelihoods," 
says Robert Mann of R.W. Mann Co., a New York airline consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 As investors and employees look around, the prospects seem fraught. TWA has 
lost almost 60% of its value since coming out of bankruptcy last November with 
45% employee ownership. The airline said last week that it would have to lay 
off 300 employees in another cost-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
 Casualty lists come daily. Delta Air Lines is cutting 15,000 workers over the 
next three years; Sara Lee, the Chicago-based conglomerate, said last week that 
it would cut 8,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 What's happening is that communications technology is changing business 
profoundly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Beverly Hills offices of International Creative Management, for 
example, microphones hang from an acoustic ceiling in a conference room with an 
enormous U-shaped table, numerous chairs and a large video screen. The room is 
used by up to 30 people for teleconferences with the talent agency's New York 
and London offices. 
</P>
<P>
 And that kind of setup is repeated all over the country these days, cutting 
down dramatically on business travel. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason full-fare business passengers, who used to account for more 
than half of all air travel, are down to 40% and declining. In fact, U.S. air 
travel has shown no growth in five years, except for the low-cost operations of 
Southwest Airlines and now CALite, the no-frills service launched by 
Continental Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a short-term or a short-hop phenomenon. The newest Boeing 737s, 
with transcontinental range, will be delivered to Southwest in a few years, 
bringing low fares to cross-country flights. United and other airlines must 
meet that competition or fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Such competition brings pressure on workers. But note that it's not low-wage 
or foreign competition. The no-frills airlines pay as well as others, but they 
work harder and use technology more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have a higher-than-average degree of employee ownership and 
involvement in decision making. "Technology requires business to change," says 
Corey Rosen, head of Oakland's National Center for Employee Ownership. "Those 
who try to retain the old structures of management and labor become 
bureaucracies with vested interests" -- a condition many companies are 
struggling to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 A great variety of companies have overcome difficulties by making employee 
ownership work: Kroger Co. and other supermarket chains; Herman Miller Inc., 
the office furniture supplier; Hallmark Cards; Parsons Corp., the Pasadena 
engineering company, and several steel companies, which have gone through more 
than a decade of restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "A stake in ownership helps employees accept difficult changes," says Joseph 
Blasi, co-author of "The New Owners." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't only look at large companies. There are thousands of small, 
employee-owned companies that are successful," says Vittoria, who took Avis 
into employee ownership in 1987 after five years in which it had five different 
owners in the junk bond takeover follies. 
</P>
<P>
 Avis, which had a strong balance sheet, borrowed $1.3 billion to buy stock for 
the employee stock ownership plan. More than 90% of that debt has been paid 
from company profits; the 13,000 employees literally have earned equity. 
</P>
<P>
 But employee ownership is not about finance, says Vittoria, who holds an MBA 
from Columbia University and has spent most of his career with Avis. It's about 
communications. "You have to over-communicate to get everybody thinking about 
how to make their jobs better, and then you have to empower them, depend on 
them to make decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Avis has 150 employee participation groups at locations around the United 
States. Vittoria spends a lot of time visiting them, "not always traveling, 
sometimes by conference calls," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Something is working. Despite rough times and heavy competition, Avis has 
increased its value 244% in seven years of employee ownership. Maybe ownership 
and commitment are just longer words for trying harder.

FOR MULTIMEDIA'S EMERGING SUPERSTARS, ARE HOLLYWOOD TALENT AGENTS. . .; THE 10% 
SOLUTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When International Creative Management agents Bill Block and Steve Stanford 
arrived at the Medford, Ore., airport last month to find a white limousine 
awaiting them, they were mortified. 
</P>
<P>
 Expensive cars are not generally a source of anxiety for talent agents. But 
the only reason Block and Stanford had ventured a visit to the depressed 
logging town was to persuade the ponytailed computer game programmers at 
Trilobyte, a start-up multimedia firm housed in an old schoolhouse, to let ICM 
represent them. They feared the customary limo might be, well, inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood agents want a cut of the multimedia revolution. But to get it, they 
must breach a cultural gap as wide as the distance from Sunset Boulevard to the 
information superhighway. Most of the software developers and 
techno-entrepreneurs who are pioneering new forms of interactive entertainment 
have never had an agent -- and aren't at all sure they want one now. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten percent of the deal -- the agent's traditional fee -- seems rather costly 
to many start-ups working out of their kitchens. And if your idea of a star is 
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, an agent isn't the obvious key to fame and 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't hear a lot of positive stuff about them," observes Rand Miller, 
co-creator with his brother, Robyn, of the popular CD-ROM game "Myst." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, each of the major agencies has set up "interactive" teams to seek out 
deals in the new arena, and each has had some success. They were on the job at 
the annual Digital World conference in Los Angeles last week, schmoozing with 
people who often looked like they'd rather be reading their electronic mail. 
ICM chief Jeff Berg was on a keynote panel. The Agency for the Performing Arts 
even held a news conference to announce it had signed Greg Roach of HyperBole 
Studios, a CD-ROM developer in Bellevue, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the agencies jockey for multimedia domination, the main battle turns 
out to be not so much persuading prospective clients that they can cut a better 
deal than the others as persuading them that agents really do serve a useful 
function in life. Really. 
</P>
<P>
 "People definitely have preconceived notions about agents," concedes ICM's 
Stanford, whose previous work in the computer industry lends him more 
credibility than most in the eyes of the programming community. "It comes from 
a lack of understanding of what we do -- that we're on their side, we're the 
guys who fight for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as William Morris' Lee Rosenberg puts it: "They need to understand that we 
add value." 
</P>
<P>
 Agents argue that their traditional role as catalysts -- bringing people 
together to package deals -- is essential in an industry as amorphous as new 
media, where no one is quite sure who is right for which job, or where to find 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Programmers, they note, often fancy themselves "artists" and can be just as 
temperamental and in need of ego-stroking as any Hollywood client -- though 
Rosenberg says they "probably need less hand-holding." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as the industry evolves, some new media mavens concede that agents may 
unavoidably have a role to play. But for now, the agents frequently find 
themselves running up against what one calls multimedia's "carpetbagger 
reaction" to their advances. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the ironically self-conscious attention to details such as cars and 
clothes. "They leave their Armani suits in the closet when they come up here," 
says Drew Hoffman, a CD-ROM developer in San Francisco. "They wear their 
'new-media wardrobe' -- Gap shirts and slacks." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, it wasn't the ICM visitors' vehicle that most annoyed 
Trilobyte co-founder Graeme Devine, recent winner of New Media magazine's 
Programmer of the Year award for the CD-ROM title "7th Guest." 
</P>
<P>
 Devine is a dedicated comic book reader who moved his family to the mountains 
of southern Oregon to escape Southern California's frenetic pace and high cost 
of living. And he had trouble relating to Block, who is known as a particularly 
relentless Type A in a profession that measures aggression on a scale far 
transcending that of normal mortals. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, says Devine, he ignored a request to stay away while the 
25-person Trilobyte team was in the midst of finishing its second title. 
</P>
<P>
 For another, "he's a different breed of human," Devine says. "I really believe 
it's not an act with him. That's the way he is. He might as well be from a 
different planet for all we have in common." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Trilobyte won't use ICM's services. It's just that Devine 
expects ICM's clients to pay for the privilege -- not the other way around.  
</P>
<P>
 His logic: The advances in technology that have so vastly expanded the market 
for computer software by making it possible to incorporate video, high-quality 
audio and sophisticated graphics have also opened up a new market for 
traditional Hollywood writers, actors and musicians. Devine and many other 
developers see themselves more as studio chiefs than as artists needing to be 
marketed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came to our door; we didn't go to theirs," Devine says. "So if we'd like 
to use the voice of Patrick Stewart or someone, we'll call them -- but we don't 
want to pay the 10%. They wanted to represent Trilobyte. We said, 'We want it 
to go the other way. We'll call you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "7th Guest" cost $466,000 to make, sold 1 million copies and so far has 
recorded retail sales of about $45 million. Those numbers -- for a game that, 
not unlike a movie, employed a screenwriter, a director and several actors -- 
are what make the agents salivate. They're also what make CD-ROM developers 
wary of people who claim they can "add value." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are calling to discuss some great idea you have on how you can make 
money with our product, please press five now," recites the voice mail 
recording at Id Software, the Mesquite, Tex.-based creators of another popular 
CD-ROM game called "Doom."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet Id Chief Executive Jay Wilbur says ICM's dynamic duo -- Block and Stanford 
have covered a lot of ground -- knocked down a few of his stereotypes: "They 
weren't sipping on Perrier when they walked in the door, and their cellular . . 
. phones were at least in their pockets. They didn't even say 'babe' a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur's ideas for the merchandising of "Doom" range from a movie version of 
the game to mouse pads and Doom GI Joe action figures. Talent agents, he 
concedes, might be able to strike better deals than he can. But at the same 
time, "10% is a hard pill to swallow. It's not like we're a one-man shop. We're 
a well-oiled, 10-person machine, and we have someone whose job it is to oversee 
these opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude gets to the heart of why multimedia firms have proven such a 
hard sell for agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The stars of high-technology have traditionally been born in dorm-room 
obscurity and risen to greatness by building their companies' stock value. So, 
unlike some Hollywood creative types who depend on agents to handle their 
business arrangements, would-be tech phenoms see business acumen and deal 
making as part of the job. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the much-talked-of "convergence" with Hollywood, most multimedia 
entrepreneurs are following that Silicon Valley model. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the artists in the new-technology area are not looking for employment 
by others at the highest possible price, which is what agents are so good at 
finding for their clients," notes Stan Coleman, an attorney specializing in 
multimedia at Beverly Hills-based Weissmann, Wolff, Bergman, Coleman & 
Silverman. "Bill Gates is the archetype, not Steven Spielberg." 
</P>
<P>
 All is not lost, though. Spielberg's agent, Creative Artists Agency chief 
Michael Ovitz, has also been hanging out with Gates lately, when he's not 
discussing deals with companies like AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft and AT&T are in a slightly different category from start-up CD-ROM 
developers, and CAA's recent talks with the two Fortune 500 firms reflect the 
agency's strategy for multimedia: Concentrate on the bigger strategic alliances 
between entertainment and technology firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the rivalry between CAA, ICM, William Morris and the smaller agencies 
has taken a new form in a field where everyone is starting from ground zero and 
long-held strengths may not apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been difficult for a lot of the agencies to find the innovators in 
this area, because their network of sources isn't as sophisticated as it is in 
the other mediums," says Hollywood-Silicon Valley crossover Mike Bacches, who 
co-wrote the "Rising Sun" screenplay and is a founder of Palo Alto start-up 
Rocket Science Games. "A few really smart agents have done really well, but the 
rest of the pack isn't even around the first turn yet." 
</P>
<P>
 ICM chief Berg, who has been featured in the ultra-hip magazine Wired and 
plans to open an office in San Francisco, has been carefully building an image 
for ICM as the "interactive agency." In a recent interview, Berg's comments on 
how the agency is "platform agnostic" and on the lucrative potential of Hughes 
satellites as an alternative to cable TV were punctuated by phone calls 
involving Julia Roberts' latest deal with Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm recently orchestrated a deal between Random House, Broderbund 
Software and Theodore Geisel's widow for the electronic rights to the Dr. Seuss 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 William Morris has kept a lower profile, although it is working with several 
multimedia firms in New York and Los Angeles. The agency put together a 
video-game deal for the comic team Penn & Teller, for instance, that is 
expected to be released this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 CAA is working on deals that would create ways to link some of its clients who 
have expressed interest in interactive projects -- John Singleton, Oliver Stone 
and Francis Ford Coppola among them -- into the technology world. Unlike 
William Morris and ICM, the agency appears less interested in representing a 
large stable of small start-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always kept a very small client list in every area of the agency," says 
Dan Adler, CAA's point man on new media. "We don't intend to sign hundreds of 
young developers and see which become successful. When we work with developers, 
we'll look for people we believe are making a difference in the landscape and 
help them reach their goals." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason may be that there's not a whole lot of money in interactive deals 
at the moment. Video games are a $6-billion-a-year business, but the bulk of 
that is still in cartridge games, which do not hold the sophisticated graphics 
of CD-ROM software. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go to Spago or the Ivy with these guys," concedes Louis Henderson, a 
member of William Morris' new-media team. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors and directors who have ventured into multimedia productions have 
done so either out of personal interest in the trendy world of interactivity or 
a lack of more lucrative job offers in TV and film; stock options are not an 
unusual form of payment for both the talent and their agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Berg, along with other industry analysts, believes the interactive 
software business will become big enough to warrant an investment in time and 
labor now.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to broaden this end of the agency," he said. "We think a 
significant part of our future representation base will be people who work in 
the software development and digital creation area." 
</P>
<P>
 Will ICM win the business? With developers who don't know the difference, 
"it's a lot of times just a matter of who gets there first," one agent says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creative Artists? The name doesn't mean a whole lot to me," says Chris 
Brandkamp, who spearheaded the recent search for an agent at the Miller 
brothers' firm, Cyan. 
</P>
<P>
 They want "Myst" turned into a movie, and recently signed with Harvey Harrison 
of the Jim Preminger Agency ("Does everybody know Harvey? Is he a pretty 
well-known guy down there?" Brandkamp wants to know) in part because they 
failed to make it through the bureaucracy of the better-known firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like, 'Who do you know? Nobody? OK, bye,' " Brandkamp remembers. A few 
agents he talked with had never heard of "Myst." "It's an interactive CD-ROM," 
he would explain. Came the response: "What's a CD-ROM?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Cyan team thinks it will be better represented by a smaller firm, where 
the odds of being overshadowed by the traditional clients of a higher-profile 
agency seem lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of the agency, certain parts of the interactive pitch are 
essentially the same. The name dropping, for one. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in and they tell us how big they are, how powerful. They rattle off 
a bunch of their big stars, and they say, 'Oh, we could reach that person for 
you, noooo problem,' " says Drew Hoffman, the San Francisco software developer 
who created the CD-ROM "Iron Helix." 
</P>
<P>
 And even the hardest-core programmers are not immune to the dazzle. The guys 
at Id were wowed by the idea of working with "Evil Dead" director Sam Raimi. 
Dinner with Kevin Costner sounded awfully nice to Cyan. And Devine at Trilobyte 
would love to team up with "Twin Peaks' " David Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kotick, chairman of Los Angeles-based video game developer Activision, 
has assigned two employees to working with agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the agencies," he says. "I want all the agents in Hollywood to bring 
us people and ideas. And unlike my counterparts in Silicon Valley, I do not 
begrudge them a single dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, all the attention is somewhat overwhelming for programmers to whom 
"agent" is more likely to mean the computer programs being developed to sift 
through and personalize the reams of information and entertainment coming soon 
to a TV or PC near you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows how it will work out?" says Pepe Moreno, the Los Angeles programmer 
who created the best-selling "Hell Cab" for Time Warner Interactive and is 
currently in negotiations with CAA about making an equity investment in his 
firm. "The relations between the talent agencies and multimedia talent might 
not follow traditional patterns. But two years ago, I could never have talked 
to CAA. It's all changing very fast."

'SCHOOLS WITHIN SCHOOLS' PAY OFF IN PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The walls haven't been painted in 30 years, and the clocks are right only 
twice a day. But within the tumbledown confines of Abraham Lincoln High School, 
a group of teachers and students is showing just how simple -- and 
inspirational -- school reform can be. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is called the Environmental Technology Academy, one of more than 
two dozen career-oriented "schools within schools" nurtured by a nonprofit, 
business-backed partnership called the Philadelphia High School Academies. 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent afternoon, the teen-agers in Roger Meyers' class were donning 
chemical-resistant suits and oxygen tanks, part of their training in hazardous 
waste management. They've been studying the basic science of chemical pollution 
and are now learning how to clean up a hazardous material spill -- gaining an 
Environmental Protection Agency certification in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dirty job," a sweaty Sharmeka Scott said as she peeled off her suit 
after a run around the schoolyard. "But I plan on making a career out of 
environmental accounting. This is the best education you can get." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the 4,000 students in the Philadelphia Academies, the 17-year-old 
Scott travels a long way -- 90 minutes in each direction -- and accepts a 
longer school day in order to participate. But for the most part, the sacrifice 
is worth it: More than half of all academy graduates go on to college, and 
another third find jobs in their fields. Dropouts are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of national soul-searching about education and job training, when 
even extreme solutions -- such as turning over the operation of public schools 
to private companies -- are getting a serious hearing, the Philadelphia 
Academies demonstrate how much can be accomplished with just a few corporate 
dollars wisely spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The business community in Philadelphia does not provide an extraordinary 
amount of financial support -- far less than it should, some people say -- but 
it does contribute a great deal of manpower, equipment and service. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, companies, school officials and teachers have found a 
structure for working in harmony that their counterparts in other urban school 
systems, including Los Angeles, might want to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 The designers of the Los Angeles Unified School District's LEARN reforms have 
not chosen to extensively emulate the Philadelphia effort. But nationally, the 
academies have become a model for reforming troubled big-city high schools. An 
Environmental Technology Academy student, Matthew Fleming, addressed the 
Washington bill-signing ceremony in early May for President Clinton's 
"school-to-work" legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old program has spawned a host of imitators in California and 
elsewhere. Some of them, such as the academies at Pasadena High School, are 
considered highly successful. The California Department of Education provides a 
little more than $3 million a year for academies in 45 high schools around the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Philadelphia Academies remain unique in crucial respects. Only here is 
the program overseen by an independent, nonprofit corporation, Philadelphia 
High School Academies Inc., which acts as advocate, fund-raiser and mediator 
among corporate sponsors, school administrators, teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic concept behind the academies is almost embarrassingly obvious: Carve 
out semiautonomous programs of 100 to 200 students within massive public high 
schools and give them a practical, vocational focus that makes traditional 
academic work more relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 Then get the businesses in that sector to support the effort, not only with 
money but with equipment loans, job placement services, expert advice and a 
variety of smaller favors. And remain flexible at all times, particularly in 
regard to how businesses participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good old-fashioned education: We're breaking the large high school 
down into smaller, more manageable units," said Natalie S. Allen, president of 
Philadelphia High School Academies. "The unique role we play is that both sides 
(the school system and the business community) view us as a spokesperson, a way 
to speak to the bureaucracies." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it began with the Electrical Academy in 1969, the Philadelphia Academies 
have grown to include 27 separate programs in 10 career areas at 18 high 
schools. Nearly 4,000 students -- up from just 850 six years ago -- are now 
enrolled, with an expansion to 5,000 set for September, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is being accomplished on a remarkably meager budget. Philadelphia 
High School Academies will spend about $1.5 million this year, mostly from 
corporations, while the school district pitches in by allowing slightly smaller 
classes and paying academy teachers an extra $600. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen says the total extra annual cost is about $400 per student, less than 
10% of the $4,800 that the 208,000-student Philadelphia School District spends 
on each pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other major urban school districts around the country, Philadelphia is 
plagued by budget shortfalls, political infighting, crumbling facilities and 
the overwhelming social problems of the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight to the suburbs has reduced the proportion of white students in the 
district to 22%, with African Americans now accounting for 62% of the school 
population. The dropout rate, which has been declining, stands at 7.4% of 
eligible students per year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the academies, many simple, inexpensive things make an enormous difference. 
Take the telephone, fax machine and photocopier in the office shared by the 
Environmental Technology Academy and the Horticulture Academy at Abraham 
Lincoln High. They are hardly groundbreaking innovations, but most public high 
school teachers have no easy access to such tools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives teachers a sense of ownership, makes them feel they're being treated 
as professionals," said David Kipphut, a science teacher and director of the 
two academies. 
</P>
<P>
 The design of the academy program nurtures a close relationship between 
students and teachers and a sense of pride in both. Students enter in the ninth 
grade and spend four years with the same group of 75 peers and 15 teachers. An 
integrated curriculum mixes traditional academic study with practical 
vocational work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really a family here," said Dennis Fischer, 17, who will attend Temple 
University in the fall.  
</P>
<P>
 He and five fellow seniors fairly bubbled with enthusiasm about the academy 
one recent afternoon, describing how other students in the high school -- 
particularly those in a rival school-within-a-school affiliated with Temple -- 
were envious. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that sense of family, and the feeling that teachers really cared, that 
were most important to Alexander Perez, a 1976 graduate of the Electrical 
Academy who is now an electrician and construction supervisor with the 
Philadelphia Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in junior high, I was what they now label 'at-risk,' " he said. "I 
came from a gang-infested neighborhood, my grades were horrible. . . . But when 
I got to the academy, they stressed a sense of belonging, and there was a sense 
of caring by the teachers. When people care about you, you start to think 
differently about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The specific training Perez received at the academy was ultimately useful as 
well, helping him gain admission to the apprenticeship program of the 
electricians union. 
</P>
<P>
 The academies were conceived as vocational education programs that would 
prepare students for jobs directly out of high school, and they specifically 
targeted "at-risk" students. 
</P>
<P>
 But that focus has changed in recent years. Admission remains open to any 
student in the school system, but applicants must have passing grades and 
attendance in junior high school. High achievers who once would have shunned 
anything with a vocational orientation are now drawn to some of the academies, 
notably the Environmental Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 And most academy graduates today go on to some form of post-secondary 
education, rather than moving directly into the work force. Their career 
choices often stray far from their academy specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a neat program. I really enjoyed the Environmental Academy -- but I 
wouldn't want to make it a career," said Robert Kenny, 18. "I want to be a 
teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 The skills and experiences the academies provide are broadly applicable. An 
elaborate mock interviewing project with local companies, for example, gives 
all academy seniors a chance to practice their presentation skills, get 
feedback from corporate executives and establish contacts that might be useful 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 For this kind of effort, the independent academy organization is crucial; 
teachers and administrators would not have the time or resources to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Having an independent point of contact is viewed as a tremendous asset by the 
business community, which is loath to get involved in the complex political 
battles and administrative bogs that mark big-city school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy "staff oversees the processes very, very closely," said John 
Leonard, president of Cigna Group Insurance, a major Philadelphia employer that 
contributes $50,000 a year as well as staff time and services to the program. 
"The thing I appreciate about it most is the attention to detail. Very little 
room is left for wandering." 
</P>
<P>
 The danger, of course, is that as the academy program gets larger, such 
attention to detail could become more difficult. And relations with the school 
system and the teachers union -- remarkably smooth so far -- could become more 
complicated if the academies were to emerge as a de facto shadow school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a broad reform effort in Philadelphia -- the "charter schools 
initiative," which is based in part on the academy model -- has stumbled, in 
part because of resistance from the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding also remains a problem for the academies. The Philadelphia School 
District this year must cut $30 million out of its $1.3-billion budget (on top 
of a $60-million cut last year), and that could make it more difficult to pay 
for the extra teachers the academies need. 
</P>
<P>
 Many private-sector benefactors -- including Cigna, IBM, Unisys, Pennsylvania 
Bell and the Philadelphia Electric Co. -- are facing fiscal pressures as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raising money in Philadelphia is tough," said J. Lawrence Wilson, chairman of 
the academy board and chairman and chief executive of Rohm & Haas, a chemical 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the academies' stellar track record, Allen, president of the academies 
organization, must spend much of her time raising money -- although $1.5 
million seems like a drop in the bucket for a big-city business community. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this works, why not support it like crazy?" Cigna's Leonard asked. "It's 
still not as appreciated as it might be."

RENO AIR'S RISKY FLIGHT PLAN; TRANSIT: THE SMALLER CARRIER HOPES TO INHERIT 
AMERICAN'S O.C. ROUTE CASTOFFS, BUT COMPETITION MAY PROVE TOO MUCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The name is Reno Air, but it could just as easily be called American Airlines 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, Reno Air grows closer to the troubled Texas-based behemoth, which is 
retreating from money-losing short flights to concentrate on more profitable, 
cross-country routes. 
</P>
<P>
 American has been handing off many of its West Coast runs to 17-plane Reno Air 
rather than try to compete with discount carrier Southwest Airlines. Though 
American consequently loses ticket revenue, it hopes to at least maintain 
passenger loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure former customers understand the connection, low-cost Reno Air shares 
ground crews and reservations counter space with American in many of the 11 
cities it serves. It also offers miles in American's frequent flier program and 
summer travel programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A beneficial relationship? 
</P>
<P>
 Not as beneficial as one might think. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely aloft two years, Reno Air has suffered two consecutive quarters of 
losses as it has realigned itself to take advantage of a "strategic 
relationship" with American and cut non-productive routes. The changeover has 
also brought Reno Air into direct competition with industry leader Southwest, 
which began 15 daily flights from Orange County last month. 
</P>
<P>
 One airline forecaster now considers Reno Air at high risk for financial 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have gradually moved out of their niche," said Steve Lowry, president of 
Aviation Forecasting & Economics in Arlington, Va. "They really stepped onto 
some competitive routes that the incumbents are not going to let them 
penetrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air is facing some resistance as it attempts to begin service at Orange 
County's John Wayne Airport later this month. It would become the only 
low-cost, low-fare airline at John Wayne besides Southwest. As such, it has the 
backing of airport staff in trying to take over American's six daily flights to 
San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are excited about the possibility," said Reno Air President Robert W. 
Reding. 
</P>
<P>
 Other airlines are objecting, however, saying that they, and not the smaller, 
Nevada-based carrier, are entitled to American's castoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the American-Reno proposal were approved, the county would be denying to 
United an opportunity to grow at the airport," a United Airlines lawyer wrote 
to the County Board of Supervisors last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled Tuesday to decide on whether to allow Reno Air 
temporary use of the American routes through September. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air's link with American is prompting a metamorphosis for an airline that 
began by trying to reach those travelers who have been left in a void between 
airlines that charged a premium for tickets while offering lots of service or 
the carriers that offered lower ticket prices and no-frills. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was to create an airline that matched the service of the long-haul 
carriers while offering the fares of the short-haul fliers, notably Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The monsters' costs were too high and the new entrants were offering a 
cheapie product," said Reno Air's colorful chairman, Lee Hydeman. "My view was 
you could offer a good product at a good price." 
</P>
<P>
 So Reno Air keeps costs relatively low -- 8 cents to fly a single passenger a 
mile compared to Southwest's 7.2 cents -- while offering assigned seating, 
snacks and meals and first-class sections. Southwest eschews such perks. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air charges the same or a couple of dollars more than Southwest on most 
routes. The one-way anytime fare from Los Angeles to San Jose, for instance, is 
$69 for Southwest and $72 for Reno Air. 
</P>
<P>
 To hold down its costs, Reno Air has taken advantage of the fire-sale bargains 
created in the recession-ravaged airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air bought leftover equipment from defunct airlines like Chicago-based 
Midway for as little as 10 cents on the dollar. An aircraft glut allowed it to 
lease several new MD-80 jetliners at cut rates. Its work force largely came 
from those displaced by Midway Airlines and other carriers, many of whom are 
earning less pay than in their old jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air is also borrowing a few ideas from Southwest. It flies only a single 
brand and type of plane, which lowers maintenance and repair costs, and it 
keeps its ground time to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Southwest worried? "I'm sure we can compete against any carrier," said 
spokesman Ed Stewart. "Our market share in California has been growing and 
still is growing. We think that's a testament to what the customer is after." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air's Hydeman thinks he knows. That's why he helped start the airline. 
</P>
<P>
 The 65-year-old veteran airline executive who thought he had retired to ranch 
in Arizona, recalls seeing a small story in the newspaper a few years ago about 
an old friend from Continental Airlines who was looking into a venture called 
Tucson Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydeman called his friend, former Midway Airlines executive Joseph A. Lorenzo, 
and soon was sold on the idea of an airline that could serve medium-sized 
cities in the West. It would operate from a base city that was either a 
desirable, yet underserved, vacation destination, or a good place to connect to 
other flights. It would attempt to fill the gap caused by the demise of 
regional airlines PSA and Air Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pair couldn't generate much interest in their idea in Tucson. So Lorenzo 
-- now a consultant to the carrier and no relation to former Texas Air Corp. 
Chairman Frank Lorenzo -- went looking for another city and selected Reno. Here 
was a four-season city that had the draw of gambling and skiing at Lake Tahoe 
that could use better airline service. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydeman said he had no illusions about the difficulty of the endeavor. "I told 
the front-end investors that they had an 80% chance of going down the tubes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reno Air began to turn a profit within months after it started flying in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest little airline in the world," as it billed itself, was just one 
of several start-ups being created to try to undercut the major airlines where 
they were weakest -- short distance flights, which produce the least amount of 
profit because of generally lower fares and planes that spend additional time 
in terminals instead of in the air making money. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air gained notoriety when it announced plans to fly from Reno to 
Northwest Airlines' home city of Minneapolis. Although Northwest was not flying 
the route, it considered Reno Air's expansion to be a turf incursion. It 
countered by planning more flights not only to Reno but elsewhere on Reno Air's 
flight system as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest backed down, however, under pressure from federal aviation 
authorities. The successful faceoff gave credibility to Reno Air, not to 
mention a windfall of good publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline has since added planes and destinations in five states, a growth 
cycle that executives hope will continue. Their goal: a 50-plane fleet serving 
the entire West. "We ain't there yet," Hydeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air has had its share of setbacks, too. The company abandoned service 
from Reno to Minneapolis and Kansas City last year, as well as San Francisco. 
All the time, it was building its alliance with American. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes confused travel agents, the company said. As a result, traffic 
tumbled in January when available seats were only half-filled, well below the 
break-even point. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Reno Air lost $6.1 million in the first quarter, ended March 31, 
on operating revenue of $42.4 million. It finished last fiscal year with a net 
loss of $7.1 million -- almost all of it from a fourth-quarter loss -- on 
revenue of $124.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air stock, which traded as high as $17.75 a share in the last year, 
closed last week around $6 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 President Reding said Reno Air has since bounced back with passenger loads 
running about even or just above the break-even point. The company also says it 
expects its fortunes to improve as travel agents and passengers become more 
familiar with its destinations and schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say that Reno Air should be wary of Southwest, which can 
pulverize competitors with fare wars. It was just three years ago, for 
instance, that Southwest drove rivals into a tailspin by pricing its Los 
Angeles-San Francisco route about $20 each way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southwest has been able to compete in any market they choose to enter," said 
Lee Howard, president of Airline Economics International, a consulting company 
in Washington. "The secret is to steer clear of competitors who can outlast you 
and out-price you." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Reno Air is in no position to challenge the dominance of Southwest 
right now, consultant Lowry warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have eroded most of their equity. They are undercapitalized. They cannot 
afford a misstep," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air has been careful to point up the differences between itself and 
Southwest. Travel agents, for instance, can book Reno Air flights directly 
through their reservation computers. Southwest has to be phoned directly 
because it doesn't pay to participate in the major reservations systems as a 
cost-saving measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Travel agents will try to book someone who is easy to deal with. Southwest is 
not easy," said Thom Nulty, president of Associated Travel in Santa Ana, a 
major chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air has received high marks from passengers. Those waiting to board Reno 
Air flights at LAX last week seemed to agree -- at least compared to Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 John York, a lighting technician from Irving, Tex., said he appreciates that 
Reno Air offers credits in American's frequent flier program. York, who logs 
about 50,000 air miles a year, said, too, that he can't stand Southwest open 
seating policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't fly Southwest because I have to have an aisle seat," he said, 
pointing to a bum knee that prevents him from scooting over. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Edward Cortese, a retired aerospace engineer from a Sacramento suburb, 
on "Southwest, they get you to move quicker. It's the cattle car approach." 
Reno Air, he added, was proving a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Most passengers put top priority on low fares which is a plus for Reno Air, 
said David Stempler, executive director of the International Airline Passengers 
Assn., a Washington trade group. Convenience comes next, followed by the 
generosity of a carrier's frequent-flier program. 
</P>
<P>
 Any of those factors, he said, can decide which airline a passenger will 
select. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air, and airlines like it, will succeed as long as they "don't exhaust 
their ability to perform in their niche or . . . get so impressed with 
themselves that they think they can do it everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Hydeman said he's aware of the risk and is trying to keep Reno Air focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to prevent ego cancer from coming into play," he said, "and that 
has been a problem at every airline." Reno Air at a Glance

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / MICHAEL J. BOSKIN: LET'S SEND WASHINGTON A MESSAGE 
ABOUT STATE'S ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, former chairman of the President's 
Council of Economic Advisers, is Tully M. Friedman professor of economics and 
senior fellow, Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The early-June Labor Department report showing California's unemployment rate 
declining to 8.3% is welcome news. It confirms what most of us had thought -- 
that the jump in the unemployment rate between March and April was a 
statistical anomaly. The May rate is the lowest in almost 2 1/2 years. The 
modest May job growth corresponds to most other state economic indicators, 
which depict a gradual improvement from a very deep, long-lived recession. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons the apparent economic recovery in California is 
proceeding slowly, some of them traceable to policies emanating from 
Washington. With the November elections approaching, what policy positions 
should Californians demand of candidates for federal office seeking their 
votes? 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense. President Clinton plans to accelerate the defense drawdown through 
1998. What we need is a defense policy geared to national security in a 
dangerous and volatile world. With nuclear proliferation, regional conflicts 
and ethnic strife, the Clinton defense cuts do not make sense. Californians 
should insist on a slower, smaller drawdown. This would have the side benefit 
of reducing the drag on the California economy, which the rest of the economy 
must offset. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxes. Clinton's enormous increase in marginal tax rates clobbers California 
disproportionately. Because California (despite its recent economic 
difficulties) is a high-income state, the higher tax rates take their toll much 
lower down the California income distribution than is the case nationally. The 
same is true of the higher taxes on Social Security benefits starting this 
year. And the small-business sector -- so vital to California as well as to the 
nation -- was hit quite hard by the Clinton tax increase, though not so hard as 
to throw the national economy back into recession, as some pundits had 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for its many new spending programs, such as its welfare non-reform, the 
Clinton Administration will be scrambling for more "revenue." And in a second 
term, Clinton would have to come up with massive tax increases as the cost of 
his programs grew far beyond projections -- at least if history is any guide.  
</P>
<P>
 Given these prospects, let's elect people who will work to lower tax rates, 
not raise them. (By the way, expect Clinton to again propose his forgotten 
middle-class tax cut as part of his 1996 reelection bid.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Health care reform. The Clinton health care reform is too bureaucratic and 
too expensive. Private analysts estimate it would cost from 1 million to almost 
3 million jobs nationwide. California would be disproportionately affected. 
Because California has a higher percentage of uninsured, the burden on small 
business would be severe here.  
</P>
<P>
 Because California already leads the country in enrollment in health 
maintenance organizations, any hypothetical savings from a move to "managed 
competition" would be far less. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians should insist on far less radical and expensive reform, such as a 
package of insurance, malpractice and other voluntary reforms that would 
greatly expand access, improve portability and help control costs without 
risking major economic disruption and deterioration in the quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
 * Illegal immigration. As the grandchild of immigrants, I have always placed 
great importance on America's beacon to the world, so wonderfully symbolized by 
the Statue of Liberty. Successive waves of immigrants from every continent and 
national and ethnic heritage have made tremendous contributions to this 
country, including its prosperity. A few years ago, sweeping legislation 
provided amnesty for illegal immigrants already living in the United States. 
Subsequently, reform of legal immigration both raised the quotas and based them 
more on skills in short supply.  
</P>
<P>
 But the federal government has failed to deliver on its promise to control the 
borders and stem the tide of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Washington is increasingly mandating benefits that states 
must provide to illegal immigrants. This policy has increased the incentives 
for people to enter the country illegally and overwhelmed the social services 
and tax capacity of the handful of states that receive almost all the illegal 
immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 This is particularly true of California, where welfare benefits are 40% to 
100% more than those of New York, Florida or Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson was right to join the governors of Texas and Florida in suing 
the federal government to make it pay the costs of providing these services. 
The beef here is not with people from other countries trying to better their 
lives -- that's what we all try to do. With the government providing cash, 
education, health care and other benefits, just getting here puts many of them 
at a standard of living that would be upper-middle class or higher in their 
countries. The true problem is the breakdown of our federal system. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government is responsible for our borders. If the policy is to 
curtail illegal immigration, the federal government ought to do so. If the 
policy is to allow greater immigration, the federal government, not a few 
selected states, should finance the services provided to immigrants in the 
interim before they become productive workers and taxpayers. Again, 
Californians should demand that our elected officials coordinate efforts to 
make Washington pony up. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal policies are not the only factors affecting California's short- and 
long-run economic future. But this agenda would go a long way toward ensuring 
more business starts and expansions, which would lead to more job creation and 
further declines in unemployment.

CALIFORNIA HAS FEW ACADEMY PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena School District, with seven academies at its four high schools, 
has perhaps the most ambitious academies program in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A Space Academy boasts the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California 
Institute of Technology as partners.The Graphics Arts Academy is allied with 
several universities and printing companies, as well as the Printing Industries 
Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, there are academy programs in 
business-finance and travel-tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 But statewide, there are only 5,000 students enrolled in academy programs. The 
state cannot provide money for all the districts that want them, and an effort 
to more than double the existing $3-million academies budget has been stalled 
by the state's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the business community for the most part has not made a sustained 
commitment to the concept. Unlike in Philadelphia, none of the school districts 
with academies has an independent organization to encourage and coordinate 
business involvement. JONATHAN WEBER

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: COMMODITIES: RISKS AS HIGH AS AN 
ELEPHANT'S EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sharp price hikes for many agricultural and industrial commodities, and 
forecasts for even more gains ahead, have spurred renewed interest in the 
highly volatile and intensely risky "futures" market, where fortunes are made 
and lost in the blink of an eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the raw-materials side of the commodities markets was fairly 
moribund all through the 1980s and into the early 1990s, as investors focused 
on more sophisticated financial products such as stocks, bonds and interest 
rate contracts, experts note. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks partly to soaring values for items such as coffee, cocoa, lumber, 
cotton and copper, sophisticated investors are returning to "traditional" 
commodities and are promising a revival in this long-maligned industry.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen more interest in the commodity sector from sophisticated 
investors recently than we have seen in a long time," says Hunt Taylor, 
managing director of Reynwood Trading Corp. in Short Hills, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 However, analysts readily acknowledge that the bulk of investors in this 
highly volatile market lose money rather than make it. Even when the market 
holds the potential for stunning double-digit returns, investors must be 
cautious, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you make a killing without getting killed? 
</P>
<P>
 Realize, first, that there are essentially three ways to invest in 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 You can invest on your own by setting up a commodity trading account with your 
friendly neighborhood broker. The broker would then open a margin account for 
you that would allow you to borrow a portion of the cost of each commodity 
contract from the brokerage. In other words, if you wanted to buy a $100,000 
contract on wheat futures, the broker might require only a $5,000 deposit. The 
remaining $95,000 purchase price would be borrowed from the brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as your contract rises in price -- or stays level -- the $5,000 is 
your entire cash investment. But if the value of the contract falls, you'd be 
subject to a "margin call," for which the broker requires you to kick in more 
cash to secure your loan. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also choose to trade through a commodity trading adviser. CTAs, like 
other money managers, agree to invest your money for a set fee. In the 
commodities market, the fee usually works out to about 3% of your assets, plus 
15% to 25% of any profits the adviser earns for you. Most CTAs require minimum 
investments of $10,000 or more. Some won't take accounts of less than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the huge investment requirements with CTAs and the chance of losing 
more than your initial investment when you open an individual commodities 
account, the bulk of middle-income investors are advised to enter this market 
through commodity pools. Commodity pools are the futures industry's answer to a 
mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Operated by many major brokerage firms, such as Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter, 
commodity pools allow fairly modest investments of between $2,000 and $5,000. 
Like mutual funds, commodity pools are sold through prospectuses that detail 
many of the risks and rewards of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 It is imperative that investors read these documents carefully, because not 
all commodity pools are alike. Some are fairly conservative, while others are 
highly risky. Some boast long and illustrious track records, while others are 
new and have little to show in the way of past performance. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you look for in the disclosure documents? 
</P>
<P>
 * Risks. Pools must detail the risks of commodities investments in general and 
of the pool in particular. Some of this is simply boilerplate, but it should 
prepare you for the general risks in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Background of the principals. The principals of the pool must disclose 
pertinent information about their employment history, conflicts of interest and 
any past criminal, administrative and civil actions taken against them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investment methodology. Some pool investments are based on computerized 
models. Other pools follow technical trends or engage simply in discretionary 
trading. The pool will also disclose how its cash is divided among commodity 
trading advisers and what segments of the commodity market those advisers 
specialize in. If you want to invest in agricultural commodities, look for a 
pool that specializes.  
</P>
<P>
 If you want a diversified pool, make sure the operators are dividing the 
pool's cash among a well-rounded group of CTAs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Redemptions. To limit the possibility of a cash crunch that will force the 
pool managers to sell positions at inopportune times, most funds limit your 
ability to cash out to just once a month or once a quarter. If you miss the 
redemption date, you must wait until the next one. If you have immediate needs 
for your cash, the redemption dates are pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fees. Brace yourself. Fees in this industry are stunning. The average 
commodity pool will charge between 7.5% and 10% of your invested capital each 
year . However, if the results are still good, fees in this range shouldn't 
discourage you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Performance. The hardest thing about reading a pool disclosure statement is 
that there is so much performance information that it's hard to discern what it 
all means. 
</P>
<P>
 Pools must disclose their month-by-month investment returns for their entire 
history or for three years, whichever is longer. If the pool doesn't have much 
of an investment history, it must disclose the investment history of its 
principals. Any adviser who invests more than 10% of the pool's assets will 
usually list his or her investment history as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures should all be net of fees. In other words, what's reported is what 
investors earned after all fees and expenses were deducted. However, realize 
that when performance figures are listed for the CTAs rather than the pool, the 
pool's fees are not included. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, pool investment results are more telling than CTA investment 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Also be wary of hypothetical return information. Some pools "back test" newly 
formulated trading strategies and then report how they would have fared if 
they'd used the strategy with real money. Hypothetical results always look 
great, but they mean nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, realize that past performance does not predict future returns. 
However, past volatility is a good indicator of future volatility, says Sol 
Waksman, president of Barclay Trading Group Ltd., a Fairfield, Iowa-based 
futures consulting and publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Waksman, who studies CTA returns, says many investors make the mistake of 
pouring their money into a pool immediately after it's had a great month. But 
they don't notice that monthly returns gyrate wildly. Then, when the inevitable 
happens and the fund has a losing month, they get frightened and bail out.  
</P>
<P>
 Jumping in and out of commodities is a great way to lose a lot of money 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors should carefully note how much the fund's results vary and determine 
whether they're comfortable living with the swings. If you're not, invest 
elsewhere.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CONDO LOSSES: RESIDENCE VS. RENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I bought a condo several years ago for my principal residence. I want to 
sell it, but it has lost about 15% of its value since the purchase. May I 
convert the condo to a rental and declare the lost value as a tax deduction? I 
know losses on principal residences are not tax-deductible. -- M.L.B . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, you may convert your condo to a rental, but it won't do you any good. 
Why? Because the tax basis of your condo will be its value as of the date of 
conversion or its original basis at purchase -- whichever is lower. So if your 
condo has already declined in value, that fact would have to be recognized in 
an appraisal conducted at the time you convert it. A decline before the 
conversion could not be written off as an investment loss. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think the condo will continue to depreciate, however, converting it to 
a rental now might make sense. In that case, the longer you hold it as a rental 
before selling it and taking this investment loss, the better. Our experts 
recommend at least six months, preferably a full year or more. U.S. Securities 
Can Be Ordered by Mail 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How can I buy U.S. Treasury bonds? 
</P>
<P>
 D.D . 
</P>
<P>
 A. With interest rates creeping up, investor interest in Treasury securities 
has been rekindled. Treasury bonds can be purchased through several outlets. 
Banks and brokers routinely sell them, but they will probably charge a sales 
fee, as much as $25 per bond. You may also buy bonds directly from the U.S. 
government, which does not charge a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds are available in $1,000 increments (up to a maximum of $5 million) from 
the Federal Reserve System or any of its branches. Bond maturities range from 
two years to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bills, or T-bills as they are usually called, are sold in three-, 
six- and 12-month maturities and are available in $1,000 increments -- from a 
minimum of $10,000 to a maximum of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest rates paid on the bills are set at auction every Monday. You may 
buy Treasury bonds directly from the Fed at 950 S. Grand Ave. in Downtown Los 
Angeles. You may also buy them by mail by writing the Bureau of the Public 
Debt, Washington, D.C. 20239. Personal checks are accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 To order T-bills by mail, you must send a cashier's check made out to the 
Federal Reserve Bank. For Southern California residents, the address is P.O. 
Box 2077, Terminal Annex, Los Angeles, CA 90051. 
</P>
<P>
 Certified mail is recommended to ensure that the order arrives at least one 
day before the auction. 
</P>
<P>
 You will be best served if you already have an account with the Federal 
Reserve Bank. You can start one by writing the bank at the above post office 
box and asking for the New Account Request form. Complete and return it, and 
you will soon receive notice that your account has been opened. 
</P>
<P>
 To participate in an auction, write the bank and state the type of security 
you want to buy. Include your account number and the appropriate type of check. 
</P>
<P>
 To purchase Treasury bills, which carry maturities of up to 12 months, you 
must send a cashier's check. 
</P>
<P>
 For Treasury bonds, which carry maturities of two to 10 years, you may send a 
personal check. 
</P>
<P>
 As you may know, Treasury bills are sold at discount, with the discount rate 
correlated to the interest rate the bill carries. Buyers should send checks for 
the full amount of the bills they want to purchase. Reimbursements for the 
discount are returned to the buyer soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time buyers generally get the discount reimbursements by mail. For all 
subsequent purchases, the checks are deposited directly into a bank account 
designated by the buyer. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Q. How may I find out if the companies in which I hold some stock are still 
operating? -- S.C . 
</P>
<P>
 A. First, consult the Standard & Poor's Stock Guide, which contains pertinent 
information on about half of all publicly held securities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 You might find this guide in the reference section of your local public 
library. It should also be part of the permanent collection of every brokerage 
house. The S&P guide will tell you on which exchange your stock is traded. But 
be warned that it covers only a fraction of U.S. publicly held companies. 
</P>
<P>
 If your company isn't named in the guide, your next step should be to consult 
the "pink sheets" published by the National Quotations Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 This listing -- it used to be printed on pink paper -- covers about 15,000 
publicly traded companies and gives the names of the brokerage houses handling 
their stocks. While a local brokerage branch office might not have a copy of 
this listing, its regional trading center certainly will. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you get a broker to look it up for you? Perhaps, but brokers are in the 
business of making trades for their customers, not doing research for the 
public. Of course, brokers are always happy to oblige a potential customer. 
</P>
<P>
 If your company isn't in the pink sheets, you have only a few choices left. 
You can retain a stock research company to find out what became of the company 
whose certificate you hold -- did it merge with another company? go bankrupt? 
cease operating? 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide to proceed with the research, try contacting Prudential American 
Securities in Pasadena. At $40 for each company search, this company offers the 
least expensive stock research service of any we know. Send a copy of the stock 
certificate along with a check for $40 to 921 E. Green St., Pasadena, CA 91106.

SATELLITE TECHNOLOGY OFFICIAL MOVES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Satellite Technology Management Inc. said Friday that its chief financial 
officer, Wayne Blair, is stepping down but will work as a consultant to the 
company for the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The parting is amicable, company spokesman Steve Strohman said.Blair, 55, was 
not available for comment. He joined the company as vice president of finance 
and chief financial officer in January, 1992, shortly after Satellite 
Technology went public. Before that, Blair had been a consultant to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Strohman said the duties of chief financial officer and vice president of 
finance will be reassigned in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Satellite Technology makes and markets satellite communications networks. Most 
of its business is overseas. The company's stock, traded on the Nasdaq market, 
dropped 12.5 cents a share Friday to close at $7.50.

AN EXPLANATION FOR NASDAQ PRICE MOVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The observation of two academicians ("Study Suggests Collusion Among Brokerage 
Firms," May 26) that trades in a large number of stocks on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market tend to move in price increments of one-quarter rather than one-eighth 
has a simple and direct explanation: the large-transaction character of many 
Nasdaq trades. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, nearly half of Nasdaq share volume is made up of block trades of 10,000 
shares or more.On Nasdaq, large investors expect competing market makers to 
trade in block sizes at one price. Similarly, smaller investors also value 
receiving single-priced executions for their trades on Nasdaq. Accordingly, the 
tendency of some stocks on Nasdaq to move in quarters simply reflects the 
business expectations that substantial executions will be provided at each 
successive price. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, and admittedly without adequate evidence, the authors of the 
paper, as reported in the article, conclude that the price movements suggest 
collusion among market makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the paper have since advised us that they have removed the 
suggestion of collusion from the title of their paper. Accordingly, we have 
requested that the researchers revise their draft study to delete any other 
unsubstantiated suggestion of collusive actions.  
</P>
<P>
 We believe they have done all investors and market participants a disservice 
by suggesting collusion without proof. To put out a disingenuous report of this 
kind only serves to confuse investors and mislead the public about the quality 
of America's public markets.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: NAPA VALLEY; CHAMPAGNE WISHES FULFILLED; BUT AT ST. HELENA'S 
MEADOWOOD RESORT, YOU'LL ALSO NEED YOUR CAVIAR WALLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY ZWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Zwick is a Times assistant news editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We heard about Meadowood Resort in the usual way you hear about anything in 
Napa Valley: through the grapevine. The word from the grapevine was that guests 
lived in luxury in the woods, that they drank great wine and ate great food, 
that they hiked and bicycled across 250 acres of bucolic wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we had to wait six months to get a room, and the price was high: $221 
for the cheapest room, and more than $1,500 for the most expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 At Auberge de Soleil in Rutherford, the other hot ticket in the Napa Valley, 
the wait for a weekend room was four months. The two grand luxe hotels had only 
130 rooms between them, so demand clearly exceeded supply. Nonetheless, as my 
wife and I drove toward Meadowood from San Francisco Airport, we wondered over 
and over again: Just how good could it be? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi," I said to Seamus Dooley, Meadowood's resident manager. "I'd like to 
check in." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine," he said. "Would you prefer our 1991 Bon Marche Pinot Noir or our 1991 
Clos Pegase Chardonnay?" 
</P>
<P>
 Meadowood's Friday wine reception was going full blast, and credit card 
imprints could wait. The Chardonnay was cool and wonderful, and we didn't have 
to ask for refills. We filled our plates with cheese, strawberries, pate and 
crusty French bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Seamus seated us next to Jeff and Sherry from Brentwood in the warm, woodsy 
lobby, between the fireplace and the grand piano. Jeff and Sherry had just 
visited the Clos Pegase winery up in Calistoga, and the art there was 
beautiful, they said, and it was everywhere. Tomorrow Jeff and Sherry were 
going to Meadowood's health spa, and they were going to get massaged with 
Chardonnay. So were their two daughters. Chardonnay massages were $120 apiece, 
and I was starting to understand why every other car in the lot was a Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 In our rented Chevy, we followed Dave, our bell person, along a winding rural 
road under a canopy of pines to the path leading to our gabled cottage, high on 
a hillside. We had our own private porch overlooking the grounds. Dave showed 
us how to open the skylight and the mini-bar, and he said the apples and 
Chardonnay were free. 
</P>
<P>
 We dressed for dinner. Jackets were required at Meadowood's Starmont dining 
room. The room was packed and buzzing, yet the maitre d' treated us as if we 
were his only customers. His greeting was so warm that I turned around to see 
who the VIPs were, but there was no one behind us. 
</P>
<P>
 I ordered a bottle of Markham Merlot, which Meadowood's wine pro, John 
Thoreen, had recommended at the wine reception. We loved it. With it our 
waitress brought us rabbit in phyllo dough and salmon with cucumber salsa, a 
big step up from our customary beer nuts. We chose the prix-fixe dinner -- any 
appetizer, any entree and any dessert for $42. We started with prawns and 
smoked squab, moved on to sea bass and John Dory, and finished with a 
flour-free baked-to-order chocolate cake and a raspberry souffle in Chambord 
sauce.  
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning we walked down the hill in our whites, required for our 
upcoming croquet lesson, and ate a buffet breakfast in the Grill.  
</P>
<P>
 Our croquet lesson was a hoot. Phil, our teacher and Meadowood's assistant 
croquet pro, taught us trick shots for knocking your opponent's ball to the 
wrong side of the wicket, but I never got the hang of it. After our one-hour 
lesson, my wife and I played a serious game, and she beat me 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 We drove north to Sterling Vineyards in Calistoga, a 15-minute trip, with a 
picnic lunch that we had bought on our way in from San Francisco at Oakville 
Grocery, a gourmet landmark that offered 19 kinds of olives. 
</P>
<P>
 To go to the winery and tasting room at Sterling, we parked just off Route 29 
and took an aerial tram over lush green forest. At the top, we drank two wine 
samples and carried our third, a Cabernet Sauvignon, to the picnic deck just 
outside the tasting room. My wife sliced up hunks of sweet barley bread, 
Cotswold cheese with chives, Scotch Cheddar cheese and red and green apples 
while I uncorked a bottle of Johannisberg Riesling that I had picked up at the 
Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville. As we took in the view of the Napa Valley 
and enjoyed our leisurely picnic, my wife said, "I hope Sterling doesn't mind 
that we're using their picnic deck to drink somebody else's wine." 
</P>
<P>
 "No chance," I said. "They don't even sell their own wine up here." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, a Sterling wine host stopped over to say, "I'm sorry, but 
we can't permit customers to open their own wine." He confiscated what little 
was left of our Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
 On our return, I set out to explore Meadowood's three miles of hiking trails. 
They were steep and rugged, a challenge. From the heights, I could see just how 
sprawling Meadowood was, how remote some of the lodges were. I watched half a 
dozen golf carts scurrying about the forested grounds, carrying suitcases and 
room-service meals. 
</P>
<P>
 At the health spa, between the Olympic-size lap pool and Meadowood's seven 
tennis courts, a well-toned blond fitness instructor told me about Meadowood's 
philosophy of balance, of good food and wine along with sports and health 
programs, and asked me if I might be interested in a massage. 
</P>
<P>
 She rubbed Chardonnay gel onto my arm, and told me about the Chardonnay 
massage. "It's our signature here at Meadowood," she said. "It really makes you 
glow." 
</P>
<P>
 My arm had in fact taken on the peach glaze of a Thanksgiving turkey, but I 
turned down the massage. 
</P>
<P>
 For supper, my wife and I drove south to Yountville, 10 minutes from 
Meadowood, for dinner at Domaine Chandon, one of the Napa Valley's most popular 
restaurants ever since Moet-Hennessy opened it in 1978. One attraction was the 
Domaine Chandon sparkling wine at supermarket prices. We ordered a Carneros 
Blanc de Noirs for $14. 
</P>
<P>
 Domaine Chandon was very '80s, with complicated dishes that ended up as mere 
squiggles on our plates. My dessert, for example, was creme brulee millefeuille 
with caramel pistachio ice cream, poached pears and butterscotch sauce. The 
whole thing was smaller than a Ping-Pong ball. Good, though.  
</P>
<P>
 As we drove back onto the grounds at Meadowood, hotel staff members and fellow 
guests waved and smiled. We felt like we lived there. We wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 We took a romantic walk under the stars, past the pools and tennis courts, and 
waved to guests sipping wine on their porches. 
</P>
<P>
 We awoke with hunger pangs. Meadowood served an elaborate Sunday brunch, but 
it was only 6:45 a.m. and we wanted something now.  
</P>
<P>
 Tra Vigne, a venerable Napa Valley Italian restaurant, had just, the day 
before, begun opening for breakfast. In the Cantinetta, an Italian 
delicatessen, we had two chefs and two servers all to ourselves. We ordered 
organic poached eggs whipped with chives and tarragon through a cappuccino 
maker until they were fat and fluffy. We scooped up the liquid with big 
brioches and drank down thick, delicious cafe mocha. The head chef invited us 
to fill a plate with huge strawberries, all we could eat, no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 We window-shopped on St. Helena's turn-of-the-century Main Street for half an 
hour, returned to Meadowood and said our goodbys. We turned in our keys and 
signed our credit card vouchers but, although we checked out of Meadowood, 
Meadowood will never check out of us. Budget for Two

BOOKS TO GO: HAVING A FIELDING DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BRAZIL 1994 by Pamela Bloom and CARIBBEAN 1994 by Margaret Zellers (both 
Fielding Worldwide, Inc., $16.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 The Fielding travel-book empire seems to be thriving. Handsome, freshly 
revised guidebooks are appearing under the imprint almost monthly, it seems, 
and in the best Fielding tradition (travel-guide pioneer Temple Fielding caught 
the last plane out in 1983, and his company is now owned by Robert Young 
Pelton), they are detailed and opinionated and authoritative. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Bloom's guide to Brazil is energetic and colorful, and includes plenty 
of asides on the country's varied and seductive music (on which Bloom is an 
acknowledged expert). The practical guidebook information (hotel prices and 
phone numbers, shop hours, etc.) is more extensive than in many Fielding 
guides. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't trust Margaret Zellers on music, though. She tells us that entrepreneur 
Richard Branson (of Virgin Records, Virgin Atlantic Airlines, etc., and owner 
of the private Caribbean resort Necker Island) produced albums by one "Richard 
Bowie" -- the name, of course, should be David Bowie. Other than that, she 
seems quite knowledgeable on her subject -- as well she might be, since this is 
her 16th Caribbean guide for Fielding. 
</P>
<P>
 BELGIUM 1994 by H. Constance Hill, BRITAIN 1994 by Joseph and Judith Raff, 
FRANCE 1994 by Gary Kraut, HOLLAND 1994 by H. Constance Hill, ITALY 1994 by 
Lynn V. Foster and Lawrence Foster, SCANDINAVIA 1994 by Martha Berman, SPAIN & 
PORTUGAL 1994 by A. Hoyt Hobbs and Joy Adzigian, SWITZERLAND AND THE ALPINE 
REGION by Margaret Zellers and EUROPE 1994 by Joseph and Judith Raff (all 
Fielding Worldwide, Inc., $16.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 More in-depth Fielding-style guidebooks, covering most of the more popular 
European destinations. Full of authors' personal tips and asides, the books 
seem more personal and thus more credible than many similarly encyclopedic 
volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 One maddening thing, though: There seems to be no consistent style for the 
hard-core facts and figures. Thus, for instance, some hotel and restaurant 
recommendations include address, phone number and prices, while others include 
none of the above, or only one or two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true of opening hours and prices for monuments and museums, data 
about shops, etc. Whether this is simple sloppiness or some misguided but 
intentional stylistic idiosyncrasy, I don't know -- but it's very annoying, 
and, at the very least, means that travelers will have to supplement these 
otherwise comprehensive guides with competing guidebooks just to get the 
essential details. 
</P>
<P>
 BUDGET EUROPE 1994 by Joseph and Judith Raff (Fielding Worldwide, Inc., $16.95 
paper), THE GREAT SIGHTS OF EUROPE 1994 by Patricia and Robert Foulke (Fielding 
Worldwide, Inc., $16.95 paper and SHOPPING EUROPE 1994 by Joseph and Judith 
Raff (Fielding Worldwide, Inc., $12.95).  
</P>
<P>
 These are three other new Fielding titles, with self-explanatory specialized 
focuses, to which the above comments apply. 
</P>
<P>
 EGYPT by Michael Haag (Cadogan Guides/Globe Pequot Press, $16.95 paper) and 
EGYPT & THE SUDAN, third edition, by Scott Wayne and Damien Simonis (Lonely 
Planet, $16.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Tourists aren't necessarily welcome in Egypt today, or rather aren't 
necessarily welcomed by all Egyptians; but if you're going, either or both of 
these would be splendid companions for the journey. Like all the Cadogan 
Guides, Haag's book is reasonably comprehensive and written in a lively style 
that manages to be informative without ever becoming pedantic. The Lonely 
Planet approach is a bit more oriented toward detail and inside information; 
using it is like traveling with an old Egypt hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Books to Go appears the second and fourth week of every month.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH BARGAINS IN AUSTRIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Austria may have an expensive reputation, but it has opportunities for 
economical hiking and biking, with plenty of traveler's hostels, pensions and 
camping facilities to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 In Austria, 30% of the population over age 6 cycles regularly, and one of the 
most popular cycling routes is along the Danube River. The bike trail stretches 
217 miles from Passau, on the German-Austrian border, through Vienna to 
Hainburg. Details about the route are covered in a free leaflet called Danube 
Cycle Track available from the Austrian National Tourist Office. It provides a 
basic map, information on the sights en route, and listings of accommodations, 
camping facilities, restaurants and emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 Bikes can be rented at 160 train stations in Austria, and you don't have to 
return them to the same station they were rented from. Deposits are not 
required, but you will have to produce identification such as a passport. The 
regular daily rental fee is $7.20. Travelers who have arrived by rail on the 
same day that they rent the bike are eligible for a reduced rate of $4. If you 
arrive by rail after 3 p.m., you can have the reduced rate the following day. 
Mountain bikes can be rented for $12 by rail travelers, or $16 if you haven't 
arrived by train. It's advisable to make a reservation for weekend rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Austrian "Rabbit Cards" are available for unlimited travel on the 
Austrian National Railways for any four days within a 10-day period using first 
or second class services. The regular Rabbit Card costs $153 first class and 
$103 for second class. The "Junior" version, which is available to any traveler 
under age 26 on his/her first day of use, costs $95 for first class and $64 for 
second class. This year, for the first time, the cards must be purchased from a 
travel agent before you go abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 To bring your bike with you on Austrian Railways, you need a "bicycle 
take-along card" that costs $2.40 per day. 
</P>
<P>
 For those cycling along the Danube, there is a special "Bike Hiker" rail 
service operated by Austrian Railways between Vienna and Passau. The trains 
have special cars outfitted with bicycle stands. The fee for transporting your 
bike on this train is $3.20. 
</P>
<P>
 A real advantage to budget travelers who like to hike is that many of the 
Austrian resort areas provide free guided hikes for visitors. This can be a 
good way to spend a day with an expert, picking up advice for a more extensive 
hut-to-hut adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, anyone who stays one night in Innsbruck can join in on free daily 
guided mountain hikes, and guests who need them are even provided with free 
boots and rucksacks to borrow. The three- to five-hour hikes are operated by 
the Alpinist School of Innsbruck and are lead by qualified mountain guides. On 
Tuesday evenings, "lantern" hikes are conducted up to a mountain hut where you 
can buy refreshments. This year the program operates until Oct. 8. Ask at your 
hostel/hotel for your free Club Innsbruck Card and the hiking program details.  
</P>
<P>
 Hikers and bikers should keep in mind that you can have your heavy luggage 
sent ahead to your train station or a hotel using Austrian Railways. If you 
take your luggage to the train station, it costs $3.20 per piece to have it 
delivered to another train station in Austria. You will need to allow one 
overnight for it to get there. If you want to store luggage at a rail station 
the cost is $1.60 per piece, per day. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who need help cutting costs in Vienna, the Austrian National Tourist 
Office can provide you with a free copy of Youth Scene -- Vienna, a 15-page 
publication covering information on accommodations, camping facilities, 
cycling, making phone calls, entertainment, sightseeing, swimming, public 
transportation, emergency services and changing money. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies are available from the Austrian National Tourist Office, 11601 Wilshire 
Blvd., Suite 2480, Los Angeles, Calif. 90025; telephone (310) 477-3332.

MATURE TRAVELER: CRUISING FOR THE LONG HAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANK KOVELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As travel industry officials have documented, senior travelers are frequent 
cruisers who make up a large segment of the passenger lists on freighter 
cruises -- which tend to be longer and less expensive than regular cruises. 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger statistics, tabulated by Ivaran Lines, a leading freighter cruise 
company, indicate that the average age of freighter travelers on their ships is 
60. And this number has dropped from an average age of 70, after Ivaran 
launched its present South America fly/sail programs, in which the traveler may 
cruise in one direction and return by air. The older average age on previous 
trips may have reflected the fact that the itineraries were nearly twice as 
long and only retirees could afford to spend the seven to eight weeks required 
for such long voyages. 
</P>
<P>
 The M/V Americana, Ivaran's Norwegian-registered flagship -- a freighter, with 
programs during the summer -- is a luxurious passenger/container ship that has 
room for only 88 passengers. All cabins and suites have full bathrooms, color 
TV and VCR, refrigerator, mini-bar, safe and telephone.  
</P>
<P>

DESTINATION: HAWAII; COMPOSING A LITTLE WATER MUSIC ON OAHU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALE PAGET and SUSAN PAGET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "There's one thing you gotta learn when you're in Hawaii," says retired local, 
Cory Crooks of Oahu, as he shakes his hand with an upright thumb and pinkie, 
giving us the well-known Hawaiian high sign. "You have to know how to hang 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
 We've just capped off the first week of a two-month family backpacking 
adventure through the Hawaiian Islands with a swim and a snorkel in the 
world-famous Hanauma Bay Beach Park, about a half-hour bus ride from Waikiki. 
</P>
<P>
 We can hear our son, Henri, 7, letting out excited gasps through his snorkel 
as he encounters schools of rudderfish and striped mullet. 
</P>
<P>
 The bay teems with more than 150 varieties of tropical fish that don't mind 
rubbing gills with delighted tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the aloha spirit," explains Crooks, a volunteer educator with the 
Friends of Hanauma Bay group. "But really, they're conditioned to come in 
because the tourists feed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone gets a look at the fish. They jump up and out of the water in front 
of our non-snorkelers, Matilda, 5, and Presley, 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are beautiful," says Matilda, pretending she's Ariel, the Little 
Mermaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The public bus ride to Hanauma Bay is the farthest we've traveled from our 
Waikiki hotel since we arrived here to get our island legs at the start of this 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 1/2-hour plane ride from LAX was easier than we could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Matilda and Presley conked out half an hour into the flight. Henri introduced 
himself to a Hawaiian businessman seated next to him, and the pair spent the 
whole time trying to turn rolled-up pages of paper into headsets for the 
in-flight movie. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the scent of Hawaii that we notice from the first moment we step off the 
airplane. The aroma of the plumeria flowers causes a rush like Adrenalin. We're 
really here! 
</P>
<P>
 A shower of light, misty rain falls as we leave the Honolulu terminal in a '79 
Chevy Caprice taxi. The driver had been waiting four hours for our $23 fare -- 
a slow day for business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like living here cause this is where all the action is," he says, driving 
past nightclubs, showrooms and marinas. 
</P>
<P>
 The action for this family is at the beach, three blocks from our hotel, the 
Aston Coral Reef on Kuhio Avenue. Booked through our travel agent at $45 a 
night, it was the cheapest accommodation we could find. 
</P>
<P>
 Coated in sun block, we venture onto Kuhio Beach Park, on the east end of the 
Waikiki strip. It's like walking into a postcard. 
</P>
<P>
 Yellow catamarans and orange outrigger canoes glide along the aquamarine sea. 
Bronzed surfers on long boards ride the hip-high waves 200 yards offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 Our children, or the keikis , as the Hawaiians call them, have happily 
immersed themselves in this pretty picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of others, from just about everywhere, lounge about in the tepid sea 
as if in an enormous bathtub. There are all types here -- from G-strings to 
geriatrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaving through the crowds, in and out of the water, are prospectors with 
metal detectors looking for lost valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 We sit in the shallows watching the kids, looking at the blue sky, pinching 
ourselves. No phone calls, no faxes, no appointments and no Barney the 
dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 But even dreamy days by the sea can have drawbacks. "There's always sand in my 
tushie," Matilda tells us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't you guys play nice?" we plead, after Presley tries to demolish one of 
Henri's sandcastles. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of hitting the beach one morning, we hop a complimentary bus to the 
Kodak Hula Show -- a Waikiki institution held every Tuesday and Thursday at the 
Waikiki Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an enthusiastic, colorful and free introduction to Polynesian culture. 
The focus of the 50-year-old show is to get shutterbugs to go through plenty of 
film. There's a photo op at every sway of the hip and beat of the drum. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late afternoon the trade winds sweep across the busy sidewalk of the 
main drag, Kalakaua Avenue. Music is in the air, drifting from the beachside 
bars of the large resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The attire for sunset in Waikiki is T-shirts, shorts and shades of sunburn -- 
from grapefruit pink to ketchup red. Ouch! 
</P>
<P>
 From our hotel room we've been researching the best deals for the next stages 
of our journey, using coupon books given to us on the street and in local 
newspapers. We pick up permits for three weeks of free camping on three islands 
at the State Parks and Recreation offices in downtown Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a local travel agency, Cheap Tickets Inc., we purchase 20 inter-island 
air tickets for $45.95 each -- $27 cheaper than the full fare. We purchase 
three weeks of car rental for about $320. Cha-ching! 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for our bank account, the things we love to do have no price tag 
-- swimming, building sandcastles and making new friends. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrive early at Hanauma Bay -- a prerequisite for getting in. There, under 
arching palm trees, Cory Crooks tells us how the people of Hawaii are 
preserving the bay by limiting tourists and by restricting bread and other 
human snacks from the fish diet. Special fish food is for sale at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, Crooks gives us all a big bearhug. "This is how we say goodby 
in Hawaii," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He puts a handful of home-grown litchi nuts into our backpacks for the journey 
ahead and waves "aloha" as we hike a steep track back to the bus stop above.

DESTINATION: EUROPE; THERE'S ALWAYS A FIRST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYER and ED RABEY, Beyer and Rabey are free-lance travel writers 
based in Santa Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the 8 million or so Americans who board jets for European vacations this 
year, a goodly number will be first-timers: Eurailpasses at the ready, 
guidebooks in hand, too much luggage and acute writer's cramp from signing all 
those travelers checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The novice independent traveler may not know just what to expect on arrival, 
but most are convinced that a combination of high-school French and Davy 
Crockett determination will see them through just about anything the Continent 
can throw at them. And, bless their abiding faith, it usually will.  
</P>
<P>
 Herewith, however, is a small and random collection of hard-core facts, 
assorted trivia and blatant personal opinion gathered during our five years of 
living in Europe, plus returning several times yearly since 1957. None of it 
will armor first-timers against occasional culture shock, but it may help you 
maintain a sense of humor on the road. And that's half the battle right there. 
</P>
<P>
 Just bear in mind that things can be very different over there, often 
startlingly so. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, brace yourself for the bedside lighting in many European hotels. 
It usually falls into two categories: 5- and 10-watt. We've seen feeble 
fireflies that radiate more lumens than a Continental reading light. Thomas 
Edison would roll over at the state of his invention, but there's nothing to be 
done short of carrying a good flashlight for studying your maps after sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel showers can be just as mystifying. Demented engineers have designed 
hot-and-cold shower controls that may resemble the instrument panel of a 747, 
yet no two seem to be alike. The result can range from liquid icicles, to what 
seems very much like live steam, almost instantly. It really gets you going. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, take money: Let's start with the chiseled-in-stone fact that most of 
Europe is now very expensive, and that's only an estimate. Take away Eastern 
Europe, Greece, Portugal and the absolute boondocks of a few other countries 
and, despite the dollar's recent modest revival, dining and lodging costs in 
much of Europe can curl your hair. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't despair. We'll try to lessen the financial jolt with a few 
suggestions, plus a tip or two on how to make any European trip more enjoyable 
and rewarding.  
</P>
<P>
 Get Prior Help: One of the most inane notions held by many first-time European 
visitors is that they will simply step off the plane and all the spectacular 
scenery, innumerable joys and cultural attractions of Britain and the Continent 
will unfurl like a pageant before their eyes. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 So get in touch with the national tourist offices nearest you for the 
countries you plan to visit. (Most countries with well-developed marketing 
efforts maintain foreign government tourist offices in Los Angeles and New 
York.) Ask them for brochures and other information on your itinerary, say, of 
France's Loire Valley or Cote d'Azur, Austria's glorious Salzkammergut lake 
region, the hill towns of Tuscany or the delightful fishing villages of 
England's Cornwall. It's a marvelous travel tool and one that even veteran 
travelers often fail to take advantage of. 
</P>
<P>
 Get Train Facts: Rail Europe (800-438-7245) will send along a 44-page brochure 
outlining all the Eurailpass, Flexipass and individual countries' rail passes, 
including costs, for a no-toll telephone call. It's your ticket to travel by 
train, bus, ferry and lake steamer in 17 European countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some will still prefer to travel by rental car, and our very strong suggestion 
is that rentals be booked before leaving home, since the rack rate at the 
overseas counter will certainly be considerably more than the pre-booked cost. 
Another sensible idea is to select nothing larger than a mid-size car, since a 
huge sedan can be nothing but trouble on many European roads and most city 
streets. And gas is still hovering in the $3.50-per-gallon range wherever you 
tank up. 
</P>
<P>
 Avis, Hertz and Budget also have toll-free 800 numbers for comparing rates or 
booking. Check them out at 331-1084, 654-3001 and 527-0700 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Pack Super Light: If there is one thing that has ruined more trips than bad 
weather, the common cold and assorted other adversities, it's too much luggage. 
The Grand Tour days are over, and with them the steamer trunk, so try to make 
do with one medium-size suitcase (hard or soft) and a generous shoulder bag. 
With a careful selection of contents, this will get you through several weeks 
of European travel dressed as appropriately as anyone you'll meet, not counting 
those in Queen Elizabeth's box at Ascot or at the Vienna Opera Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how sensibly you pack, make room for a couple of downright 
necessities. Purloin at least a dozen of those flimsy plastic vegetable bags 
from your friendly supermarket. They're great for soiled and damp clothing, 
perhaps for gathering film rolls or wrapping the special herbal shampoo that 
could end up lathering your luggage if it leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The second must is a roll of your favorite T-paper, pressed flat to save 
space. While European scientists are making great headway in this vexing tissue 
technology, some of the stuff you find in the loos of budget hotels and on 
trains still resembles Johann Gutenberg's original parchment. So let the 
fastidious be forewarned. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other staples in our personal kit bags have long been the oft-praised 
Swiss Army knife and a one-liter plastic flask. The latter (ours is an 
indestructible and leak-proof hospital I.V. bottle) allows a relaxing draft in 
your hotel room after a hard day of travel or sightseeing prior to sprucing up 
for dinner downstairs. Our decades-old knife's uses are daily and innumerable, 
and tuning a piano is just about the only thing we've never tried with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shun the Movie: Never, but never, watch a movie when flying to Europe. When 
the meal is over and the lights go down, that's your cue to slip on the eye 
shades, get as comfortable as possible and put a few hours sleep in the bank 
before arrival. Jet lag being what it is, this won't make you feel like going 
discoing on your first night in Europe. But you also won't be walking into 
doors for the first two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Patrol: Leave an early wake-up call and be off on your city sightseeing 
right after a fast cafe au lait and croissant. Athens' Acropolis is practically 
deserted before 10 a.m., when the first phalanx of tour buses arrive. The 
Louvre, British Museum and other culture stops become equally inundated by 
mid-morning. With an early start, you may not have the Elgin marbles, Rosetta 
stone and Mona Lisa to yourself, but the noontime hordes won't stand 15-deep 
before them either. 
</P>
<P>
 Our favorite crash-course introduction to a city is an early morning visit to 
one of its markets. An hour or so in London's Smithfield or Leadenhall markets, 
perhaps the same in Barcelona's colorful La Boqueria at city center, will tell 
you more about a country and its people than a library of guidebooks. Just 
look, listen and learn about local food and folkways from the colorful 
costermongers and their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 If you know nothing about a large city on your itinerary, or are overpowered 
by it all, don't hesitate to take a half-day American Express or other local 
tourist company's morning tour. It will highlight the city and give you 
numerous points of reference for later navigation on your own. Vienna, Madrid, 
Athens or Istanbul will slip into focus a lot faster this way, so don't feign 
the sophisticated-traveler guise by ignoring this time-saving tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains in Europe are marvelous, and the Eurailpass surely the best thing to 
happen to European travel since World War II. Yet few people know how they can 
save even more money with the pass: Just book a couchette. 
</P>
<P>
 A couchette is a no-frills bunk in a second-class compartment for overnight 
travel, complete with clean blankets and pillow. The cost is $24 this year, no 
matter the distance traveled. For instance, a crack express leaves Paris every 
evening and arrives early the next morning in Munich, just in time for a hearty 
Bavarian breakfast of wurst, black bread and beer in the train station. Compare 
the $48 cost for two persons with the price of a double room in a moderate 
hotel in the pricey cities of Paris and Munich, and you'll see the savings, 
which of course include transportation across Western Europe with your 
Eurailpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Diners in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Spain and Greece, prefer 
their vegetables at room temperature rather than steaming hot. Flavors and 
freshness become more pronounced as plates cool, and it begins to grow on you. 
So don't send the tepid turnips back until you've tried them. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, sensible Southern Europeans often chill their red table 
wines during summer. Gourmets and oenophiles may blanch, but it's very 
refreshing and wards off the afternoon blahs after a long lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 English Everywhere: While that high school French could stand you in good 
stead at times, the lingua franca all over Europe today is English. It's very 
difficult to find a Scandinavian, Swiss or Hollander who isn't near-fluent in 
our language, and plenty of English rises from the polyglot in hotels, 
restaurants, train stations and the like all over Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to say that it's not a good idea to learn a few civilities in the 
language of the country, such as please , thank you, good morning and so forth. 
Anyone anywhere is likely to appreciate your giving their language a shot, even 
a short one, and their smile is your reward. 
</P>
<P>
 By and large, people throughout Europe are very friendly and helpful to their 
visitors. The waiter, cabdriver or hotel clerk with the disposition of a 
wounded leopard is a distinct rarity these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrific Trams: Taxi fares in major European cities can burn through a budget 
as fast as anything we know. Yet trams offer a quick and economic way of 
getting around without going broke. Amsterdam's hum along at just under the 
speed of sound and will get you anywhere in town within minutes, albeit 
sometimes skewering a pedestrian or unwary Volkswagen along the way. Paris' 
Metro system and London's Underground are also time- and money-savers and, 
contrary to misbegotten tales of woe, very simple to use. 
</P>
<P>
 While our itineraries are usually fairly firm, we almost never nail down the 
exact dates we will be in a city or town. What if a London play or favorite 
Vienna opera opens the day after our planned departure? A layover can present 
problems for the next town's hotel reservations, hence the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Long distance rates are reasonable in Europe, so just call ahead for a room. 
Or, if languages aren't your forte, have your present hotel's desk make the 
call for you. We've done this dozens of times and always with success. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer Scarcities: This is particularly important during the 
June-through-August tourist months, when everything from hotel rooms to 
Venetian bel canto gondoliers are at a premium. Now throw in a large city's 
trade fair, music festival or convention, and seeking a place to lay your head 
can be, as Zorba said of his marriage, "the full catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, some first-timers pull off a trip that ticks along like a fine Swiss 
watch, with nary a glitch in sight. Others come home aware that a first trip to 
Europe should be one of life's most exhilarating and rewarding adventures, yet 
they are vaguely dissatisfied. Planning beforehand can't guarantee your 
inclusion in the first group, but it will go a long way toward keeping you out 
of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 One last suggestion for a successful trip. If it's for three weeks or longer, 
make every effort to take a two- or three-day break around midpoint and relax 
from the heady pace. Just pick a small town or village that suits your fancy 
and hang out with the locals, with no thought to maps or guidebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days in a rustic village of Belgium's Ardennes forest, on a small Greek 
isle or amid the wildflowers of Italy's lovely Abruzzi hills will bring home 
the true meaning of recreation: to re-create one's strengths and lift one's 
spirits. Chances are very, very good that it will also be the most memorable 
part of your trip.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: SPAIN: CHURROS AND CHOCOLATE; DIP INTO THIS RICH AND DECADENT 
TREAT THAT HAS WARMED THE SOULS (AND STOMACHS) OF MADRILENOS FOR GENERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE SALMERON, Salmeron is a Madrid-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as Italians savor biscotti with espresso, and the British tea and 
crumpets, the people of Madrid embrace the tradition of hot chocolate with 
churros. This hearty duo, which may appear an unusual treat for an often warm 
climate, remains popular even as such Spanish customs as long lunches and 
siestas fall victim to the pace of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
 Intensely chocolate in flavor and so thick it generally requires a spoon, 
Spain's hot chocolate is perfect for dunking churros -- the greasy, deep-fried 
loops that are similar to doughnuts although denser and not quite as sweet. 
Sampled as a snack at almost any time of day or night, the combination is a 
tradition that appeals to all generations and socioeconomic backgrounds. In 
much the same way that Americans are raised on hot dogs and hamburgers, 
Spaniards delight in chocolate and churros. And they don't bother worrying 
about the fat content. 
</P>
<P>
 While travelers can find churros in many places in Spain -- at a street fair, 
in restaurants at merienda (the Spanish version of afternoon tea) or served in 
cafes with cafe con leche on Sunday mornings -- combining them with hot 
chocolate is a special Madrid observance. It is through this experience that 
you can see the local people in all their unadorned style. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems sure just how or when chocolate and churros came to be popular in 
Spain, particularly in Madrid. But the tradition clearly reaches back into the 
19th Century. According to "Guia del Buen Comer Espanol," a book by Dionisio 
Perez that offers insights into the food and traditions of Spain, Madrid's 
streets were full of churro makers hawking their wares at dawn during the 19th 
Century. And churros were even then commonly found in all-night chocolaterias. 
</P>
<P>
 What is certain is that this quintessential comfort food -- commonly priced 
under $3 for the pair -- warms the stomach and appeals to young and old, day or 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 While the snack tradition is popular all year long, it is particularly popular 
on New Year's Eve when, as an almost obligatory finale after sunrise on Jan. 1, 
Madrilenos indulge themselves with this familiar nightcap. The unwitting 
tourist may well bump into them dressed in their party finery, tired from an 
evening of celebration, packing chocolaterias all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 On most other days of the year, however, the chocolaterias that are part of 
Madrid's society are generally much easier to get into. In fact, there are many 
places in Madrid to sample chocolate and churros, and travelers should make a 
point to visit at least one. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being served in chocolaterias -- which may also serve coffee, 
fresh orange juice and, oddly enough, even a few alcoholic beverages, such as 
Scotch, but not sandwiches or pastries -- the other type of establishment in 
which to find them is a cafeteria/bar, which may also serve tapas and 
sandwiches, in addition to wine, alcohol and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 After living here for about five years, I have learned to savor the pleasures 
of the experience in a variety of locations I can recommend. Here are a few of 
those I particularly enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolateria San Gines is the capital's most famous location for chocolate and 
churros and the place most locals mention when asked to recommend a spot where 
tourists will see celebrities, as well as locals, sampling chocolate and 
churros at all hours of the night. Tucked away in a tiny alley just two blocks 
from the city's original center, Puerta del Sol, about three blocks east of the 
famous Plaza Mayor, this charming spot is open from 1 to 7 a.m.(on Friday and 
Saturday it is also open 7 to 10 p.m. with hours extended during the December 
holidays from 7 p.m. to morning), attracting a crowd that embraces the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Iglesias, Paloma Picasso, Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen, Mickey Rourke and 
members of Spain's royal family have been known to pop in. This happens often 
after discos close, especially the chic Joy-Eslava next door that just happens 
to be owned by the Pasadizo Co., the same company that owns San Gines. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not just the famous, nor those dressed to kill in disco finery, who 
fill the enchanting space made up of the main floor and basement of this 
19th-Century building, which was remodeled in 1986 with marble-top tables and 
sparkling brass fixtures, track lights and an intruding marble statue parked 
near the entrance. San Gines is a magnet for anyone finishing up a late dinner 
or catching a show or midnight movie, not to mention the city's barhoppers. 
Many feel the night is incomplete until they've partaken of this familiar 
childhood snack. "As a child, I drank hot chocolate at home with my family," 
said one student who was lingering with his date on velvet cushions in the cozy 
cellar. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not alone in his dedication to the experience. "I've seen people come 
around 1 a.m. and stay until we close," said one waiter. That leaves just 
enough time for a shower and a change of clothes before heading to the office. 
But this is not unheard of for Madrilenos who love the night. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer their chocolate and churros for breakfast -- and there 
are plenty -- there are other locales. Two of them, A. Domingo and San Miguel, 
are attractive to those rushing off to work, though there are significant 
differences between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 In stark contrast to San Gines, which is chic enough to appeal to the 
in-crowd, A. Domingo is Spartan, unadorned . . . the kind of place locals tend 
to visit because they went there with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 This family-run chocolateria -- in a middle-class residential area about a 
10-minute walk east of the Rastro -- has relied on the same recipes since its 
doors opened in 1903. Today the founder's grandson, Justo Domingo, prepares the 
churros in the kitchen area adjacent to the bar. At the tiny counter and bare 
tables, Domingo's siblings and their spouses serve hot chocolate in simple 
drinking glasses in much the same way their grandfather did 90 years ago. It is 
a family kind of place: unsophisticated and beguiling in its simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are only a handful of tables, the atmosphere is hurried and 
crowded, particularly during the midmorning hours. Saturday and Sunday are more 
hectic still. "It's like the local department stores on the weekends," Justo 
Domingo said. But worth any wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolateria San Miguel -- across from the Mercado San Miguel, one of the 
city's oldest remaining covered markets -- also experiences its share of 
midmorning bustle but this non-family-run business is less than 2 years old. 
Yet great attention was paid to old-style ambience in this below-ground 
chocolateria, which is lightened by a row of street-level windows. It is 
decorated with tapestries in 17th- and 18th-Century style and has an attractive 
terra-cotta floor topped by a large U-shaped bar surrounded by a scatter of 
little tables. Overall, it's a good match for Madrid's young, upwardly mobile 
professionals. Madrilenos interested in holing up in a corner can, with effort, 
distance themselves from the crowd and couples lingering over the Spanish daily 
newspaper El Pais, while those especially keen on quick service tend to snatch 
stools at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike A. Domingo, which is open only in the morning, San Miguel also serves 
in the afternoons and evenings, from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m., which makes it a good 
spot for Madrilenos partaking of the between-meal snack merienda that often 
includes chocolate and churros. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous other locations in Madrid where chocolate and churros can 
be savored during merienda or breakfast but few are solely chocolaterias. 
Instead, they tend to be bars or cafeterias that happen to serve the familiar 
combination interspersed with alcoholic drinks and tapas . Some are 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the best places to imbibe, early morning, is in a humble little 
cafeteria in the Hotel Aitana on the famous main thoroughfare, Paseo de la 
Castellana. It is one of Madrid's best-kept secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 While some might think this hotel a bit gloomy, with its aging carpets and dim 
lighting, regulars don't seem to mind. The old-style open kitchen serves as 
entertainment for those who sit at the counter, although there are perhaps half 
a dozen tables nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 At another place, not far from the Rastro, Madrid's flea market, Cafeteria 
Peyma draws a range of Madrilenos, especially on weekend mornings. The crowd 
appears to overflow directly from the Rastro into this long, narrow cafeteria 
that boasts an open kitchen. Clean and modern, Peyma has a hint of Art Deco in 
its decoration. Its churros are fresh, prepared in the morning from 6 a.m. to 
noon and later from 5 to 7 p.m. It is not unusual to stand at the bar and see 
customers elbow-to-elbow dunking their churros, almost in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 El Diamante, a 25-year-old chain of three bars, is another spot where a good 
cross-section of Madrid congregates. Its large, U-shaped counter wraps around 
the cafeteria, which also serves tapas . Spacious and noisy, El Diamante is 
neither quaint nor attractive. But that doesn't deter the crowds. In the 
morning and afternoon, customers can watch churros being made as they stand 
around the bar enjoying their warming snack. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you find yourself bargain-hunting in the Rastro on Sunday morning, 
dancing until dawn on a Saturday night or just lost in the tiny streets of old 
Madrid, you are likely to stumble upon this snack and the generations of 
Madrilenos who continue to enjoy it. Even if you customarily worry about 
watching your figure, it is best to indulge . . . at least if you want to learn 
what the locals are up to. GUIDEBOOK: Getting Sweet on Madrid

DESTINATION: FLORIDA; DOWN THE ROAD FROM DISNEY WORLD; A HALF-HOUR FROM 
ORLANDO, IN THE SHADOW OF MICKEY'S DOMAIN, A TOWN CALLED KISSIMMEE OFFERS A 
HAVEN FROM THE CROWDS AND CRUSH OF THE MAGIC KINGDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The other day I snubbed Mickey Mouse. And to be quite frank, it was an 
intentional snub -- even though I really do like the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was just that I've seen a lot of Mickey and his colleagues over 
the years, and I figured enough was enough for a while. It happened when I 
recently flew into the Orlando airport to spend a few days in Mickey's 
neighborhood. I saw all the signs inviting me back to Walt Disney World, where 
he is emblematic monarch of America's vacation capital. But I drove right past 
his front door with nary a quiver of regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, my destination was Kissimmee, the former cattle-ranching and 
orange-growing town that has blossomed into its own version of an entertainment 
capital -- and all in the shadow of Mickey's domain. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the town isn't nearly as pretty as Disney World's beautifully 
landscaped acres, but I think it, and the neighboring community of St. Cloud, 
offer just as much fun. And I didn't have to stand in any of the infamous 
Disney lines to have a good time.  
</P>
<P>
 In a hodgepodge of daily adventures, I piloted an airboat up a swampy creek; 
wandered through a vast greenhouse filled with blooming orchids; kept my 
distance as two researchers milked venom from poisonous snakes in a 
serpentarium; floated on a tube around a giant water park, and hiked through a 
new 76-acre theme park that re-creates the architectural and scenic wonders of 
China in miniature.  
</P>
<P>
 And, because I was in Florida and I wanted to do something authentically 
Floridian, I drove over to Luke's Grove, a citrus-fruit orchard where owner Bob 
Luke escorts sightseers on a short walk through acres of orange, grapefruit, 
lemon, tangelo and tangerine trees. At his invitation, I plucked a large, ripe 
tangerine from a tree, peeled it and ate the juicy segments as we chatted about 
the citrus business. 
</P>
<P>
 When you think of Orlando, you almost always think of Disney World. But 
Kissimmee, located about 25 minutes from the Orlando airport, is actually as 
close or maybe even closer to the Magic Kingdom. Many of the hotels, 
restaurants and other tourist amusements that claim a Kissimmee address stand 
just outside Disney World's southern gate, which is the main entrance. More 
than 30,000 hotel and motel rooms in the Kissimmee area draw 4.5 million 
visitors a year. So a lot of vacationers who book a trip to Orlando actually 
end up staying in Kissimmee.  
</P>
<P>
 The town, as a tourist first comes to know it, is a four-lane, 30-mile-long 
segment of U.S. 192 that stretches from St. Cloud in the east, past the town 
center of Kissimmee to the Disney World entrance and a few miles beyond. The 
guidebook I carried calls this strip "the tourist-trap trail" because the 
highway is a nearly endless succession of tourist businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think this judgment is too harsh. A "trap" suggests a rip-off, and 
Kissimmee is actually something of a bargain. I saw several decent-looking 
motels advertising prices in the winter off-season for as little as $24 a night 
for two people. Try to get a room in the Disney domain for that price. I stayed 
in a spiffy Hyatt, where I swam in the huge heated pool outside my door, for 
just $79 a night in midweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Like me, most visitors probably won't venture too far from the strip, because 
that's where most of the action is. But you really don't have to go more than a 
quarter of a mile north or south of the highway to see an older, quieter 
Florida with scenic landscapes, acres of fruit trees and broad pastures where 
herds of horses and cattle graze. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Civil War, the Confederacy got much of its beef and hides from the 
cattle ranches of central Florida, and ranching is still an important industry 
in the area. Downtown Kissimmee boasts a big saddle shop, the Saddle Rack, and 
a rodeo is held on the outskirts of town most Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 I got my first glimpse of the other Kissimmee when I spotted a sign along the 
highway advertising "Airboat Rentals U-Drive." I had never operated an airboat, 
which is propelled by a giant fan mounted just behind the driver's seat, but I 
was willing to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 The guy at the rental desk assured me I would have no trouble, and he was 
mostly right. To run the flat-bottom craft, you keep your right hand on the 
throttle and your left on a steering lever that controls two fins behind the 
fan. I got off to a wobbly start, but I managed to get my boat in firm control 
before the first test -- a tight squeeze between concrete pillars supporting a 
highway bridge overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 My ride took me about a mile and a half north along Shingle Creek, a slender, 
black-water stream lined by tall cypress trees dripping in moss. 
</P>
<P>
 I soon entered a near wilderness with little sign of civilization. I 
putt-putted up the creek, swinging from shore to shore as I mastered the 
steering maneuvers. My ride was a pleasant alternative to Disney's simulated 
jungle cruise. I didn't see any wildlife, real or fake, along the way. But 
maybe because I was in command of the vessel, my trip seemed a lot more 
thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time I became impatient with the heavy stop-and-go traffic that 
clogs the U.S. 192 strip from early morning until late in the evening. But it 
was the main avenue to almost everything, and so I had to spend a good deal of 
time on it shuttling between amusements. 
</P>
<P>
 If Old Florida interests you, I would suggest detouring briefly as you travel 
the highway to take a look at the downtown centers of St. Cloud and Kissimmee. 
On the edge of all the bustle, St. Cloud is an appealing village on the 
southern shore of East Lake Tohopekaliga. On the sunny afternoon I was there, 
the residents were out in force enjoying the lake -- many of them strolling, 
biking or roller skating on the paved path that traces the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 The old commercial area is no more than two blocks long, a vestige of another 
generation. A dozen antique shops are clustered in the row of old-style 
buildings, many of them adorned with overhanging balconies. The shops keep the 
sidewalks from looking completely empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Kissimmee is larger and busier, but it too retains the look of a 
small farm town from the past. Luke sells his oranges at the Thursday morning 
farmer's market in a parking lot near the railway station. The town is a pretty 
place with huge, interesting old homes and flower-filled gardens. It overlooks 
Lake Tohopekaliga, where I walked along the marina to take in the view. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in Kissimmee for fun as well as historical contemplation, and quickly 
enough I made my way back to the highway to take in the big show outside 
Mickey's realm. The newest attraction along the highway, and a fascinating one, 
is Splendid China, a $100-million theme park beautifully re-creating in 
miniature 60 of China's most important cultural and scenic treasures. It is 
somewhat like Disney's Epcot Center, where a visitor can get the illusion of 
visiting several foreign nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Splendid China is far superior to anything Disney has come up with yet. 
You should be aware, however, that the park opened last year in controversy. 
Partly owned by the Chinese government, it displays a replica of the revered 
Potala Palace of Tibet, a country China invaded in 1950 and still forcibly 
occupies. According to news reports from the opening, human-rights protesters 
claimed the park is a giant propaganda program aimed at Americans that 
overlooks the concerns of Tibetans and other minorities in China. I can 
sympathize with these objections. 
</P>
<P>
 But my own reaction, after a nearly four-hour visit, is that the propaganda, 
if any, is minimal. Far from glorifying the current Communist regime, the park 
exalts the architectural masterpieces handed down from the past -- whether they 
were the works of Imperial China, ancient Tibet or others.  
</P>
<P>
 The park is huge, and walking distances are great, but shady pavilions along 
the way offer Chinese food and drinks. And throughout the day, visitors are 
treated to a variety of Chinese shows. I watched acrobatic acts, a folk dance 
and a classical music performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In no zoo have I ever seen quite such an awesome collection of snakes, 
poisonous and nonpoisonous, as can be viewed behind glass in Reptile World 
Serpentarium, a commercial laboratory just east of St. Cloud. The facility 
displays more than 50 of the world's most exotic snakes, including the fearsome 
black mamba, "the most dreaded snake in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory regularly milks the venom from many of its snakes to be shipped 
to researchers elsewhere. Three times a day, at 11 a.m. and 2 and 5 p.m., 
visitors are invited to watch the process, which requires two handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was there, they milked cobras from Africa and Thailand and an Eastern 
diamondback rattlesnake, which, because of its size, has the most deadly bite 
in North America. Using a slender rod, one handler lifted each snake one at a 
time from its box, pinioning it on a table so he could grasp it with his bare 
hand just behind the mouth while his helper grabbed the tail. 
</P>
<P>
 A clear glass beaker was then thrust into the snake's mouth, and I could see 
splashes of venom running down its sides. The cobras appeared surprisingly 
docile, but the fat, wiggling rattlesnake lunged at the beaker so ferociously, 
I thought it might break the container in two -- a graphic reminder to watch 
where I step when hiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoroughly intimidated, I sought an antidote in the graceful beauty of orchids 
in a World of Orchids, a huge greenhouse in an Asian motif where hundreds of 
the tropical plants were abloom. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, I sat on a bench beside a garden waterfall to sniff the scents 
that floated past and to observe the many orchids within easy view. Afterward, 
I joined a very informative, 45-minute tour to learn more about the diverse 
world of orchids. Alex, our guide and an orchid grower, showed us large, 
fragile corsage orchids; sturdier types used in Hawaiian leis and a few orchids 
no larger than the point of a pencil. Some orchid plants bloom year-round, but 
the traditional corsage orchid flowers for only two weeks annually, said Alex, 
"which is why it is so expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 In one way or another, all of the Kissimmee attractions I visited proved very 
educational, which is what I was looking for. But near the end of my third and 
last day on the strip, I opted for pure fun. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 57, I had never been to a water park. Several times during my stay I 
had passed by one just down the road from my hotel. What the heck, I thought, 
and I pulled into Water Mania just an hour before closing time to give it a 
try.  
</P>
<P>
 I grabbed a plastic tube and bounced for a while in a simulated tidal wave. 
And then I hiked over to a simulated white-water stream. Draped atop the tube, 
I floated down the stream, which wound through the park in a circular route. 
Around and around I went, happy that kids don't have all the fun in Disney 
Country. GUIDEBOOK: A Passion for Kissimmee

HIKING: BIG SUR: THIS RAMBLE COMES WITH A VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mt. Carmel Trail puts a lot of Big Sur at your feet. Three points en route -- 
Skinner Ridge, Devil's Peak and Mt. Carmel -- offer inspiring panoramas of what 
some California naturalists call "the Middle Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
 From 4,417-foot-high Mt. Carmel in the Ventana Wilderness, you can see Carmel, 
Salinas, Monterey Bay and the Santa Cruz Mountains. The view is worth the 
strenuous day hike. 
</P>
<P>
 For weekend backpackers, the route over Skinner's Ridge and down Big Pines 
Trail into the Little Sur River watershed is ideal. From the trail head at 
Bottchers Gap, it's 10 miles round trip to Comings Camp. One of my favorite 
overnight destinations, madrono-shaded Pat Springs Camp, is a 14 1/4-mile 
sojourn round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 In summer, hikers should check with rangers about the availability of water at 
the area's backcountry campsites. Bring plenty of drinking water, no matter. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bottchers Gap is a campground and a parking area for day hikers. The trail 
head, at 2,080 feet, gives hikers a nice head start for the climb to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Carmel, drive 12 miles south on California 1 to 
the junction with Palo Colorado Road (this junction is one-quarter mile south 
of the turnoff to Rocky Point Restaurant). Turn inland, climbing 7 3/4 miles to 
the road's end at Bottchers Gap Campground. Skinner Ridge Trail begins at the 
northeast (upper left) end of the camp's parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: The path ascends north, quickly leaving behind the oak-shaded 
campground and heading into the chaparral. After brief exertion, hikers get the 
first of many views. To the northwest is the ocean; behind you, to the south, 
is the beautiful Pico Blanco peak.  
</P>
<P>
 The hike's second mile is viewless; the path zigzags, drops into gullies and 
can seem disorienting at times. After crossing a field of bracken ferns, the 
trail makes a final short, but steep, climb to Skinner's Ridge. Some of Big 
Sur's ecological complexity is apparent from the ridge: golden grasslands 
dotted with oaks, the light greens and grays of the chaparral on south-facing 
slopes and the dark greens of the hardwood forests on north-facing slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 A northward walk along the oak- and madrono-shaded ridge (these are some of 
the largest madrono growing on the central coast) brings you to a saddle and a 
junction with Turner Creek Trail. This side trail leads to Apple Creek Trail 
Camp ( 1/2 mile) and to Turner Creek Trail Camp (1 mile). Both are pleasant 
overnight stops or picnic spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue on the main route -- now known and sometimes signed as Big Pines 
Trail -- for a steep, shadeless and strenuous mile through manzanita to Devil's 
Peak viewpoint. The view includes the Pacific to the west, Pico Blanco to the 
south and lonely Ventana Double Cone to the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue another 1/10 mile east to a junction with the left-bearing Mt. Carmel 
Trail.  
</P>
<P>
 March along a scrub oak-covered ridgeline three quarters of a mile to Mt. 
Carmel's brushy, flat-topped summit. You wouldn't get much of a view from the 
top if it were not for the fortunate presence of a granite outcropping. 
Scramble up the chunk of granite, or the section of telephone pole some 
considerate soul installed atop the peak, and marvel at the vista. Due north is 
Monterey and to the northwest is Pebble Beach and Carmel. On fogless days you 
can see Santa Cruz, about 40 miles away, at the north end of Monterey Bay. 
About 20 miles to the northeast is Salinas, to the west is the deep blue 
Pacific, and to the south are miles and miles of Big Sur backcountry. Skinner 
Ridge, Big Pines, Mt. Carmel Trails 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Ventana Wilderness, Big Sur 
</P>
<P>
 Distance: Bottchers Gap to Skinner Ridge vista is 4 miles round trip with 
1,200-foot elevation gain; to Mt. Carmel is 9 mile round trip with 2,300-foot 
elevation gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrain: Mosaic of chapparal, oak-madrono woodland. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights: 360-degree vistas on Monterey Bay and Big Sur; good weekend 
backpacking trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Degree of difficulty: Moderate to strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 Precautions: Carry plenty of water; no reliable creeks or springs during 
summer months; ticks present in some brushy areas near trail.

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: A FEW WAYS TO ENSURE KIDS' SAFETY AT CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 5 million children, most between the ages of 8 and 14, will attend day 
and sleep-over camps this summer. But will they remain healthy? Will they be 
safe? Are special precautions necessary? 
</P>
<P>
 Any safety fears will probably prove groundless, according to pediatricians 
and other experts. Kids at camp are as safe, perhaps safer, than those at home, 
they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most common injuries (sustained at camps) are relatively simple ones," 
said Bob Telleen, YMCA associate director for camping and environmental 
programs who has directed camps for 25 years. Typical problems, he said, are 
foot injuries (usually resulting from inappropriate shoes), insect bites, skin 
rashes, sprained ankles and, at camps with water activities, swimmer's ear. 
</P>
<P>
 And the risks of accident and injury decline, experts said, if parents choose 
an accredited camp, obtain a thorough pre-camp physical exam for their children 
and communicate any special needs effectively to camp staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 camps, most of them for children and young people, are 
accredited by the American Camping Assn., a not-for-profit education group 
based in Martinsville, Ind., said ACA associate director Patricia Hammond. In 
all, there are about 8,500 day and resident camps in the United States, 
according to ACA estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Accreditation standards vary, depending in part on whether the camp is for day 
or sleep-over visits. For example, Hammond said, to receive accreditation, day 
camps must have someone with first-aid training on the premises at all times 
and a doctor or nurse on call. Resident camps must be visited by a doctor or 
nurse each day and must also have a first-aid-trained employee on site at all 
times, although the majority of resident camps maintain a full-time doctor or 
nurse, Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, "the camps must have some sort of emergency transportation to a 
hospital available," Hammond said. "That could mean calling 911. But rural 
camps might have their own vehicles or might have a contract with a local 
emergency squad." 
</P>
<P>
 Camps applying for accreditation are evaluated by trained ACA volunteers while 
they are in operation and are visited for re-accreditation at least once every 
three years. Evaluations center not just on health care but also on facilities, 
personnel, administration and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 While selecting a camp, experts suggest that parents ask a few questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * What's stocked in the first-aid center? 
</P>
<P>
 * If there's a health problem, when and how are parents contacted? 
</P>
<P>
 * What are the emergency procedures? 
</P>
<P>
 * What are the qualifications and training of the camp staff? 
</P>
<P>
 Most ACA-accredited camps require a pre-camp physical. (Even though such an 
exam is strongly recommended by ACA, it is not required for accreditation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should be sure that their child's pre-camp physical is more than a 
cursory once-over, said Dr. Clifford Rubin, a Beverly Hills pediatrician and 
UCLA clinical associate professor of pediatrics who completes many such 
examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin recommends that children be given a complete physical examination, 
including blood pressure, heart rate, hearing and vision testing. He also 
provides nutritional counseling, advising children on how to eat nutritiously 
at camp. Immunizations should be updated, if needed, especially tetanus. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Lyme disease, the tick-transmitted inflammatory disorder, is prevalent, 
Rubin said precautions should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 He instructs children to wear hats, to use insect repellent and to keep their 
limbs covered, especially on hikes, to help prevent attracting the tick. 
</P>
<P>
 Parental communication with the camp's health staff is also vital. Some 
parents try to hide certain health histories -- depression and hyperactivity 
are two examples -- said the YMCA's Telleen. But it's really best for the child 
to give an honest briefing to the camp staff, should he or she have special 
health needs and history, Telleen said. 
</P>

ROSARITO REACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was with considerable chagrin that I read Patrick Mott's "Rosarito Reverie" 
(April 24). Having harbored similar romantic notions about the hotel after 
peeking through its historical lobby on many trips, I convinced my husband to 
book our reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was one of the worst hotel experiences either of us ever 
encountered, from the rude staff to the room itself -- complete with dirty 
carpeting, torn furniture and ineffective air conditioner. Even the once-famous 
ballroom now displayed video machines and pool tables. But the real clue should 
have been the red and black spots dotting the ceiling and walls in our room. 
Imagine our surprise to be roused from sleep by a swarm of mosquitoes. We spent 
most of the night swatting mosquitoes with newspapers, adding more blood to the 
already splattered walls. 
</P>
<P>
 No apology or explanation from the staff upon our brisk departure the next 
morning, even when we complained of being terrorized by mosquitoes. We have no 
mosquitoes, they insisted, although exterminators were busy spraying the lobby 
when we left. The only redeeming feature of the trip was the Real del Mar Golf 
Course, where we encountered lush greens and a courteous, hospitable staff. 
</P>
<P>
 FERN LEVIN FLORES 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Hugo Torres Chabert replies: "It is unfortunate that the Flores had an 
unpleasant stay at the Rosarito Beach Hotel & Spa. A new wing opened in 1992 
providing rooms with air conditioning . It is possible that the Flores stayed 
in one of the older parts of the hotel, which is not air - conditioned. Window 
screens are provided in all rooms; often guests forget to close them, allowing 
mosquitoes to enter. The hotel is constantly renovating rooms. We also spray 
for insects on a regular basis.  
</P>
<P>
 We now have a guest relations/front desk manager to interface with our guests 
and any problems they may have.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Mott may have been disappointed by his pepper steak at Chabert's in 
the Rosarito Beach Hotel, but we were thrilled. On our last visit we (dined at) 
the relatively new Chabert's because we wanted to see the inside of the 
original hotel owner's mansion in which two salons had been converted in 1937 
to a casino for rich and famous guests.  
</P>
<P>
 The Caesar salad was one of the best we've eaten ($7 for two) and the 
perfectly done rack of lamb for two ($22) came with fresh vegetables and hot 
garlicky bread. The waiters gave us impeccable -- almost grandiose -- service. 
The whole experience was a delight.

 Your vision of Venice may not look like this, but this moment of peace 
captivated Allen S. Taylor of Diamond Bar, who was in Italy's famed city of 
canals in 1984. "On a hot afternoon in August," he wrote, "my wife and I shared 
with the gondolier that belief that even romance would profit from a cool 
moment in the shade."

 Buenos dias! God morgen! Kalimera! Annyong hasimnikka! Dobroye utro! Guten 
tag! Buna dimineata! Dobro outro! Ahlan wa-sahlan! Buon giorno! Goede morgen! 
Bon jour! Bom dia! And I hope that includes everybody. (Good thing Iran isn't 
better at soccer because I am really out of practice at saying "good morning" 
in Farsi.) 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to all you World Cuppers from around the globe. Good day to all you 
Spaniards, Colombians, Mexicans and Argentines, you Norwegians and Swedes, you 
Greeks, you Koreans, you Russians, you Germans and Swiss, you Romanians, you 
Bulgarians, you Saudis, you Italians, you Dutch, you French, Moroccans, 
Nigerians, Cameroonians and Belgians and you Brazilians, and please be 
forgiving if I got your greetings wrong. My Portuguese is particularly rusty. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Irish, I'll speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 Mornin'. 
</P>
<P>
 So how was everybody's trip? Everybody get through customs OK? Anybody see the 
Statue of Liberty? Anybody run into President Clinton or her husband? Anybody 
car pool up from South America? Everybody bring their flags? Everybody ready to 
blow into their air horns? Everybody ready to cheer or boo -- no, I mean 
whistle? Are you ready for some football? 
</P>
<P>
 Good. Have a seat, have a good time and remember the first rule of soccer: 
Keep your hands to yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of all of our 50 United States of America -- well, most of them; I 
still have some doubts about Idaho -- I hereby bid everyone welcome to World 
Cup '94, the quadrennially quintessential sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
 (Try translating that into Portuguese.) 
</P>
<P>
 Take it from me, M.D., or, as I am more commonly known here in my country, 
Doctor Soccer, this monthlong jamboree will dominate broadcasts and headlines 
from Walla Walla to Pago Pago to Bora Bora (no relation to the U.S. coach). 
After the five weeks I spent in Italy experiencing the passions of World Cup 
'90, I can assure you this: There are rich folks on Earth with satellite dishes 
and there are poor folks on Earth with no food on their dishes, but there is 
one thing such folks have in common, from Switzerland to Swaziland, and that is 
an intense interest in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor soccer, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 (In parts of the United States, balls are kicked off walls.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctor Soccer's World Cup '94 Intelligence Test," coming up forthwith, is 
provided today to test your knowledge and acumen. Score 10 points per correct 
answer. Perfect score is 200. For those who score 150-190 points, you are so 
smart, you must be a foreigner. For those who score 100-140, you wouldn't know 
Manchester United from Winchester Cathedral. For those who score 50-90, duh, 
no, the goalkeeper does not wear a mask. For those who score 10-40, you can't 
even read this newspaper, so why am I scoring you? For those who score 0, when 
did you first decide to work for the media?

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP A PREVIEW; A METHOD TO HIS MADNESS; 
U.S. COACH BORA MILUTINOVIC HAS BEEN QUESTIONED, BUT UNTIL THE REAL GAMES 
BEGIN, WHO CAN SAY IF HE'S WRONG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It will go down on U.S. World Cup Coach Bora Milutinovic's ever-growing list 
of "Things I Wish I Hadn't Said." 
</P>
<P>
 He was speaking in an optimistic burst before the U.S. team's first game of 
1993 in Tempe, Ariz., when the slate was clean and the World Cup was a distant 
speck on the competitive horizon. The opponent was Denmark, tiny Denmark, which 
had shocked the soccer world and won the European Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt seeking to be generous to the Danish coach sitting next to him, 
Milutinovic declared his goal for the U.S. team: "We want to be the Denmark of 
the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Denmark -- which won the European Championships with a stylistically 
unappealing defensive game -- bombed out of World Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the metaphor Milutinovic wants for the U.S. team? Doubtful, but he 
might have been hoping to capture that aura of the lightly regarded underdog 
and capitalize on the camouflage of low expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 It has worked. The team is draped in a shroud of questions and doubts, which 
even its recent upset over Mexico has failed to lift. The crafty Milutinovic 
wouldn't have welcomed the poor showings by the U.S. team as a way to sneak 
into the tournament unnoticed, would he? He wouldn't have arranged to show the 
team's Group A opponents only the weak aspect of the U.S. World Cup team's 
abilities? 
</P>
<P>
 That's a reach, even for Milutinovic's constant scheming. The other 
explanation is the players have done their best and sometimes they play with 
surprising skill and other times they are painful to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. national team compiled a 5-5-8 record this year and went 2-2-7 
against World Cup qualified teams. Much has been made of the players who play 
abroad and their miraculous healing powers on the team. After a particularly 
galling loss, the coaching staff could be counted on to point out the missing 
players. For a time, Milutinovic even took to keeping separate records -- with 
and without the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The dozen or so players had obvious skill -- by definition, if they were 
playing professionally outside the United States they were among the best the 
country has to offer. When the likes of John Harkes, Eric Wynalda, Tab Ramos 
and Roy Wegerle have been with the team, their fortunes have risen. 
</P>
<P>
 But how to judge? Since the 1990 World Cup in Italy, the U.S. team has had all 
its final players nine times. The team has gone an impressive 7-1-1 in those 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Soccer Federation President Alan Rothenberg: "When we have our full squad 
together and they play in the United States against top-level competition, we 
are a competitive team." 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, however, the specter of the foreign-based players has been a 
divisive factor on the team. Players in Mission Viejo either didn't pursue 
offers from professional teams or elected not to try their luck in Europe and 
then had sit at home and hear about what a second-rate bunch they were. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point this spring, there was a change in Mission Viejo. Milutinovic 
began to speak less of the foreign-based players and attempted, in his 
confusing way, to boost the morale of his team at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late or too little? It's difficult to judge what months of put-downs had 
done to the team and how much the players believed of their own ineptitude. 
DEFENSE, DEFENSE? 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. assistant coach Timo Liekoski has his "I Wish I Hadn't Said That When I 
Said It" list, too. 
</P>
<P>
 At an informal gathering of reporters before the Joe Robbie Cup in Miami in 
February, Liekoski did what Milutinovic almost never does -- he spoke candidly 
about the players, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The session was hardly controversial . . . at the time. On the day before the 
first game, Liekoski spoke in glowing terms about the defense and its 
cohesiveness and how the players had benefited from playing together for so 
long. Unlike the U.S. midfielders and forwards, only one defender -- Cle 
Kooiman, who plays professionally in Mexico -- was missing from the training 
camp that opened in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 How could Liekoski have known the defense would fall apart the next day 
against Bolivia? 
</P>
<P>
 The problem in the 1-1 tie was lack of communication. As Liekoski pointed out 
later, the team lacked a player in the back who would verbally organize the 
defense and motivate his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The goalkeeper and sweeper, by virtue of their positions on the field, usually 
fill the role. Tony Meola, when he is in goal, is not a quiet guy and has no 
problem calling out positioning tips to his teammates in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeper is another issue and might have been the key to the hellish 
weekend, which concluded with a 3-1 loss to Sweden. With Marcelo Balboa at 
sweeper, the U.S. team had a take-charge player. When Balboa went out with a 
serious knee injury, the team got used to Desmond Armstrong, also a capable, 
steady player whose tendency is not to be vocal on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lack the one guy who is going to grab the guys by the neck and say, 'Let's 
get going,' " Liekoski said. "If you listen carefully when we play, there's not 
a lot of chatter." 
</P>
<P>
 The one guy who has earned the right to run things is Thomas Dooley, a veteran 
of the German Bundesliga. Dooley's most natural position is at sweeper, but it 
is not natural for him to bark orders. He's the sort of leader whose barest 
whisper would send players off to follow him, but he's only now getting 
comfortable asserting himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Without an adequate communications system, the U.S. players were running 
around the field with no apparent plan. Since soccer is a game of action and 
reaction, if one outside back made a run upfield, for example, his opposite 
number would usually remain behind to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, Alexi Lalas was making pell-mell rushes, leaving the back open and 
men unmarked. He was not alone in being out of position, but even one player's 
missed assignment can impact each of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. defense wasn't the only thing that unraveled in Miami. Milutinovic 
had spent months attempting to introduce and sell his build-from-the-back 
system to a reluctant team whose players each had their own ideas about style. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend degenerated into a mini-revolt -- "We don't like the flat back 
four defensive formation, so we'll show the coaches how badly it works." The 
reasoning had some merit to it, but it proved fatal to players who were being 
judged on their execution of the coach's game plan, not their own. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be no mistaking the hierarchy of Milutinovic's team -- he's the 
boss and, while everyone is welcome to offer suggestions, Bora is comfortable 
disregarding them. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' attempt to usurp Milutinovic's authority was met with an iron 
fist that carried an unmistakable message: Bora might not always be right, but 
he's always the coach. WHICH TEAM WILL PLAY? 
</P>
<P>
 The maddening aspect of monitoring the U.S. team has been its inconsistency. 
The team that lost to Iceland and Chile also beat England and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 The ups and downs are a natural outgrowth of Milutinovic's constant 
experimentation: The U.S. coach spent much of the last year plugging in players 
to positions like so many puzzle pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer volume of players brought into camp -- "for a look," as the coaches 
called it -- was a factor in the confusion. Forty-five players were used at one 
time or another, and at times the notion of the U.S. team ever creating a 
chemistry was remote. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasional recall of European players also added to the ebb and flow of 
the team's fortunes. But mostly, it could be attributable to either the 
players' own maturation or some tinkering by Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe-Max Moore scored four goals against El Salvador while playing at 
center-forward, a position he rarely played. Elsewhere, players with some 
versatility were moved around the field, barely lingering long enough to grow 
comfortable with one position. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent new wrinkle was the addition of the five-man back formation 
for some games in May. Milutinovic was criticized for adding such a significant 
change so late. In fact, the U.S. team had played a five-man back before and 
will likely use such a configuration against Colombia in the World Cup. The 
team is expected to come out with four defenders against Switzerland. Romania 
remains a puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 The two goalkeepers were trapped inside a revolving-door rotation. Starting 
every other game could hardly have helped Meola or Brad Friedel find an edge or 
any rhythm, even while it gave the coaching staff a chance to evaluate their 
play. Additionally, the keepers got a position coach only 11 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which has been part of Milutinovic's plan. Presumably. Now coaching in 
his third World Cup, Milutinovic makes decisions that are at times baffling but 
often become clear later. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, there was his handling of midfielder Claudio Reyna. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna came to camp as a highly decorated college player whom some called the 
future of American soccer. Milutinovic's response to the young player was to 
ignore him and give him scant playing time. This was inexplicable to outside 
observers who, along with everyone who saw Reyna play, recognized his creative 
field vision and ball-control ability. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the first few months, any discussion of Reyna was likely to evoke a 
wave of hand from Milutinovic. Was it possible that he saw some major flaw in 
Reyna? Or was Milutinovic reacting as he usually does when told by others to do 
something? 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic's reasoning, like so many other things, was revealed at the Joe 
Robbie tournament in Miami. During a wide-ranging discussion with reporters at 
the team's hotel, Milutinovic grew visibly impatient with constant questions 
about Reyna and his lack of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic abruptly left the room and returned with a bewildered Reyna in 
tow. The coach ceremoniously placed Reyna in the middle of a circle of 
reporters and introduced him to each. He then turned to Reyna and said, "How 
old are you?" Reyna replied, "I'm 20." Milutinovic asked, "Do you think you are 
playing enough?" Reyna, having no idea where this was going but certain there 
was a right answer, said, "You're the coach Bora." With that, he was sent from 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic thinks American players lack the proper respect and veneration for 
the World Cup. The competition to make a World Cup team in the United States is 
nothing like in Italy. Milutinovic well knew what he had in Reyna and had every 
intention of using him liberally. But he wanted to make sure the young player 
-- for whom soccer had been nothing but rewards and accolades -- did not get 
the impression that playing in the World Cup was his birthright. 
</P>
<P>
 What at first looked like clumsy handling of a promising player showed itself 
to be a deft move calculated to season Reyna and knock some of the attitude out 
of him. Bringing him along slowly surely helped Reyna and the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic knew that Reyna, had he played, might have been able to set up 
more goals and the U.S. team might have won a few more games, but he has always 
been willing to sacrifice short-term gain for long-term benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: Bora knows what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 The tendency of American sports fans is to judge based on statistical 
information. By this measure, Milutinovic would be a failure. Hank 
Steinbrecher, secretary general of the U.S. Soccer Federation, has admitted as 
much. But, he notes, the World Cup record is all that matters. 
</P>
<P>
 By that standard, an assessment of the U.S. team strictly on the basis of its 
record in international friendlies leading up to the World Cup has no meaning. 
Or, taken another way, each game has to be gauged in reference to what it means 
relative to the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bora always has his eye on the big picture, the World Cup," U.S. assistant 
coach Steve Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic's Costa Rica team in 1990 lost seven consecutive games before the 
World Cup and shocked everyone by reaching the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team has at least apparently peaked at the right moment. Its 1-0 
victory against Mexico sent all the right messages to the team regarding its 
preparation. The game was played before 91,123 pro-Mexico fans at the Rose Bowl 
and the team showed a single-mindedness that has flashed before but rarely 
shone. That game offered some indication of what's possible. But those signs 
have been sighted before. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you can beat a team like Mexico under adverse conditions, I can only 
assume we will be even better in Detroit when we will have everybody's 
support," Milutinovic said. "If we put forth the kind of effort we did today, 
if someone beats us, they will have truly proved themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 What does that mean? As Milutinovic would say, it means nothing. Only World 
Cup games matter, and if the United States can't win in the World Cup and 
advance past the first round, no invocation of upsets over England or Mexico or 
the Gold Cup title will mean anything.

<P>
 * COACH: Bora Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Tony Meola, Thomas Dooley, Eric Wynalda. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Not many. The team is individually skilled but collectively weak. 
Wynalda, Ernie Stewart and Cobi Jones have excellent speed. There is creative 
ability in Tab Ramos and Claudio Reyna. Dooley reads the game well. Meola, when 
in form, can be an above-average goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: The players make mistakes when pressured, passes go astray, the 
ball is kicked aimlessly. There is a general lack of cohesion. Defense can be 
turned on either flank. Midfielders are forced to spend more time helping the 
defense than creating chances for the forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Four previous appearances. Record of 3-7-0. Best finish 
was third place in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: The United States' June 22 match against Colombia will 
not be the first World Cup encounter against the South Americans for U.S. 
goalkeeper coach Milutin Soskic. He was Yugoslavia's goalkeeper when it beat 
Colombia, 5-0, in the 1962 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Victory over Switzerland in the opening match at Pontiac, Mich., is 
virtually imperative. The crowd will be behind the team in the first World Cup 
match to be played indoors and the Swiss might be caught by surprise. 
Realistically, though, it is difficult to see the U.S. team doing better than 
in 1990, when it lost all three matches by a combined eight goals to two. 
</P>

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Team USA is a true melting pot. Seven of the 22 members of the U.S. national 
soccer team were born outside the country, two in Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the imports were the sons of U.S. military personnel stationed abroad; 
three moved to the United States with their families as children. One attended 
college here, the other established himself as one of the best players in Major 
Indoor Soccer League history. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 15 team members have varied backgrounds. They hail from nine states, 
including four from California and three from New Jersey. Perhaps the most 
important import of all is Coach Bora Milutinovic, who directed Mexico and 
Costa Rica in previous World Cups, and was born in Bajina Basta, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven U.S. team members -- John Harkes (Derby County, England), Cle Kooiman 
(Cruz Azul, Mexico), Tab Ramos (Real Betis, Spain), Juergen Sommer (Luton Town, 
England), Ernie Stewart (Willem II, Netherlands), Roy Wegerle (Coventry City, 
England) and Eric Wynalda (FC Saarbrucken, Germany) -- play in European pro 
leagues. THE COACH 
</P>
<P>
 NAME: Bora Milutinovic 
</P>
<P>
 BORN: Sept. 7, 1944, Bajina Basta, Yugoslavia 
</P>
<P>
 CUP EXPERIENCE: Led Mexico to a sixth-place finish in 1986 and Costa Rica to 
the second round in 1990. His teams are 5-2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Has coached in more than 150 international matches, believed to be 
a record ... Played 33 matches with the Yugoslavian national team ... Spent 12 
years as a player and coach with the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico Pumas. He 
coached the team to two Mexican first division titles, two CONCACAF club 
championships and an inter-Americana Cup title ... Mexico's 1986 World Cup team 
played West Germany to a scoreless tie before losing on penalty kicks ... 
Directed the U.S. team to a CONCACAF Gold Cup title in 1991 and a 2-0 upset of 
England in U.S. Cup '93. THE ASSISTANTS

 Uruguay took the lead after only 10 minutes of the first final on a goal by 
Pablo Dorado. Peucelle soon equalized and Guillermo Stabile put Argentina in

 Italy, which improved as the tournament went on, produced some excellent 
soccer in a great final to retain its title. Gino Colaussi put Italy ahead, but 
Titkos tied it almost immediately. Goals from Silvia Piola and Colaussi made it 
3-1 and, although George Sarosi reduced the deficit, Piola struck again to 
clinch the victory.

<P>
 July 16 at Rio de Janeiro 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, which had played superb soccer throughout the tournament, went into 
the final round-robin match needing only a draw to take the title. But, playing 
on home soil, it was stunned by its South American rivals. Friaca put Brazil 
ahead, but Uruguay responded on goals by Juan Jose Schiaffino and Alcide 
Ghiggia to win the trophy 20 years after their first triumph in Montevideo.

 West Germany rebounded from an 8-3 opening-round defeat against Hungary to 
beat the same team in the final. Ferenc Puskas and Zoltan Csibor gave Hungary a 
2-0 lead, but Max Morlock and Helmut Rahn pulled the Germans back to 2-2 and

 Nils Leidholm gave Sweden an early lead on a rain-soaked field, but Brazil, 
with 17-year-old Pele in outstanding form, hit back in stunning fashion. Vava 
added a pair of goals to give the Brazilians the halftime lead and two goals 
from Pele and another one from Zagalo rounded off the victory.

 July 30 at Wembley, England 
</P>
<P>
 With teams tied 2-2 after goals from Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters for England 
and Helmut Haller and Wolfgang Weber (in the final minute) for the Germans, 
extra time was needed for the first time since 1934. Two further goals from 
Hurst, the only player to score a hat trick in a final, sealed the issue. But 
the decisive goal is still a case of controversy; many contend the ball did not 
cross the goal line.

 Pele, playing in his last major international match, staged a majestic

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP A PREVIEW; NOBODIES NO LONGER; IN 
EARNING FIRST WORLD CUP BERTH IN 28 YEARS, SWISS PROVE THEY CAN PRODUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One little tabloid newspaper report and the Swiss national soccer team was 
catapulted into a debate that was anything but neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Roy Hodgson, it was reported, had issued a directive. No sex for his 
players from early June until the conclusion of the World Cup. The ensuing 
worldwide uproar -- sprinkled with knowing chuckles -- temporarily threatened 
to overshadow the fact that the Swiss would be in the event for the first time 
in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of headlines were next? 
</P>
<P>
 Strikers Who Love Too Much ? 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tango in Zurich ? 
</P>
<P>
 Oprah and Geraldo, however, can rest easy. Hodgson, stunned and irritated by 
the attention "this rubbish" was receiving, relaxed the all-out decree and 
limited the ban to simply the day before games. 
</P>
<P>
 If it were only so simple to handle the larger challenge at hand. The Swiss 
will be playing the United States in its World Cup opener June 18 at the 
Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 While it won't be as disquieting as playing Italy in Rome, being indoors in 
humid conditions against the host country in a rare morning game (11:30) is an 
imposing enough test in itself. Swiss soccer fans, though, were able to gain 
some measure of comfort when FIFA recently granted special permission to jangle 
cowbells at World Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
 To get here, Switzerland had to maneuver through a rugged qualifying group. It 
finished one point behind Italy, scoring 22 goals and giving up seven in 10 
qualifying matches. The Swiss team went 6-1-3, losing once to Portugal but also 
defeating Italy, 1-0. Perhaps the turning point came against Italy in Cagliari 
on Oct. 14, 1992, when Switzerland took a 2-0 lead before finishing with a 2-2 
tie. Beforehand, Swiss defender Alain Geiger watched a television program 
promoting the match and heard his team called "nobodies." 
</P>
<P>
 That's obviously not true anymore. But the Swiss national team certainly did 
not have much recent credibility until Hodgson took over two years ago from 
former German World Cup star Uli Stielike. Hodgson, a cigar-smoking Englishman, 
is credited with reshaping the team's mental state, providing an infusion of 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss have what is considered a good blend of youth and experience, 
relying on four players from the German Bundesliga: forwards Stephane Chapuisat 
and Adrian Knup, and midfielders Ciriaco (Ciri) Sforza and Alain Sutter. 
</P>
<P>
 To have any success against the Swiss, it generally is agreed that Chapuisat, 
who scored 17 goals with Borussia Dortmund this season, must be contained. The 
24-year-old is blessed with an impressive pedigree and already has demonstrated 
star qualities, having been voted the top player in the Bundesliga in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Pierre-Albert, a former Swiss international player, was known as 
being a hothead, but Stephane has earned a reputation as a calm, left-footed 
sniper. He is also versatile, capable of playing up front or on the left wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Chapuisat isn't a solo act; he is surrounded by an impressive supporting 
cast up front. Knup, 26, scored 11 goals in 11 games in his first season with 
Switzerland in 1991. He is strong in the air, and a broken cheekbone suffered 
last year against Portugal has not caused him to physically back off. 
</P>
<P>
 Sforza, 24, considered a superb playmaker, can play in support of his strikers 
at midfield or drop back as sweeper. His skills have improved rapidly, and he 
scored eight goals this season in the Bundesliga. Sutter, with his long, blond 
hair, is probably the most recognizable player on the team. Once regarded as a 
child prodigy, the left-footer made his national debut at 17, playing in the 
Swiss first division with the Zurich Grasshoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is not as highly regarded. The back four could be Geiger, the 
team's captain; Dominique Herr, Yvan Quentin and Marc Hottiger. There is also 
Andy Egli, a 36-year-old veteran defender, who has survived two knee operations 
and a newspaper poll in January in which 6,000 readers were surveyed and 79% 
voted in favor of dropping him from the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Marco Pascolo, who once played for Hodgson at Xamax Neuchatel, has 
been hampered by an injured Achilles' tendon, missing a June 3 tuneup against 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Switzerland's seventh appearance in the World Cup. It has reached 
the quarterfinals three times (1934, 1938 and 1954) but most recently appeared 
in the event in 1966. That year, the accomplishment was marred when two star 
Swiss players were suspended for breaking curfew. Without them, Switzerland 
lost to West Germany, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive World Cup for Switzerland was in 1954, when it played host 
to the event. The Swiss reached the quarterfinals by beating Italy twice, then 
lost to Austria in a highly unusual match. Austria won, 7-5, after it trailed, 
3-0, within the first 23 minutes.

 * COACH: Roy Hodgson 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Stephane Chapuisat, Adrian Knup, Georges Bregy. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: A mixture of youth and experience, a sound tactical game plan and 
a determination to do well after almost 30 years without a World Cup appearance 
could carry Switzerland far.Chapuisat is regarded as one of the top strikers in 
Europe and Knup is no goal-scoring slouch. Bregy is the playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: The defenders are a little long in the tooth and play in the 
Swiss League, hardly the strongest in Europe. That lack of experience against 
first-class opposition will hurt later in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Six previous appearances. Record of 5-11-2. Best finish 
was as quarterfinalist in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: When Switzerland played Austria in the 1954 World Cup, 
the match produced a World Cup-record 12 goals. The Austrians won, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The Switzerland-Romania game likely will decide which team finishes 
second in the first-round group behind Colombia. The Romanians are dangerous, 
but the Swiss appear more focused. Reaching the last eight is a possibility, 
but going beyond that would be an unrealistic goal.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP A PREVIEW; FEAST OR FAMINE; 
UP-AND-DOWN PERFORMANCES LEAVE TALENTED ROMANIA IN DIRE NEED OF MORE 
COHESIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Romanian national soccer team has met the enemy, and it is Gheorghe Hagi's 
cousin's pizzeria. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi, the biggest name in Romanian soccer, the so-called "Maradona of the 
Carpathians," has connections, and this one figured to be particularly tasty. 
Since Hagi and his teammates were going to be in the neighborhood, scheduled to 
play the United States at the Rose Bowl June 26, Hagi's cousin invited the 
entire squad to his Los Angeles pizza restaurant for an all-you-can-eat 
pepperoni fest, on the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Pompiliu Popescu, the Romanian team physician, put a swift kibosh on the 
offer, however, claiming that although "we are flattered . . . we can't accept. 
If we accept, Romania can leave the U.S. without playing the first game, 
because pizza is a top performer's biggest foe." 
</P>
<P>
 Popescu then proposed a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players can have their pizzas at one of Hagi's cousin's stores only if 
they win the Cup," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So what kind of crust will it be, Team Romania? 
</P>
<P>
 Thick, thin or none? 
</P>
<P>
 Given Romania's record in previous World Cups -- five appearances, never past 
the round of 16 -- Hagi and the boys can pretty much plan on holding the 
anchovies. Romania is ranked 12th in the world by FIFA but only second in Group 
A, where Colombia is the prohibitive favorite and the United States much 
improved over its status as the official hors d'ouvre of the 1990 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romanians will have to push to advance beyond the second round, with or 
without the extra calories. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying for World Cup '94 was an adventure in itself, symptomatic of 
Romania's longstanding reputation as one of the flakiest outfits in world 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania scored 12 goals in its first two games, trouncing the Faroe Islands 
and Wales, then lost to Belgium and the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks -- 
a 5-2 defeat in June of 1993 that prompted immediate hysteria within the 
national soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornel Dinu was deposed as coach and replaced by Anghel Iordanescu, a 
legendary Romanian player who had scored more than 150 goals during his career 
with Steaua Bucharest. Iordanescu took over with three qualifying games to play 
and won them all, enabling Romania to place first in its group. 
</P>
<P>
 It should not have been nearly so difficult, but maddening underachievement is 
a hallmark of Romanian soccer. (Bram Stoker never mentioned it in his book, but 
Count Dracula was believed to be a fan driven over the edge by one too many 
second-half collapses.) As an English soccer publication recently assessed the 
Romanians, "At their best they can beat anybody. At their worst, they could 
lose to a bunch of schoolboys from Idaho." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi, the Romanian captain and playmaker, is also caretaker of this tradition. 
He is regarded as one of the best attacking midfielders in the world and his 
lethal left-footed shot is feared throughout Europe, yet he often floats in and 
out of concentration on the field, dragging the rest of the team down with him. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Cup tuneup against Northern Ireland in Belfast, Hagi spat in an 
opponent's face, drawing a red card and losing, temporarily, his captain's 
armband. 
</P>
<P>
 When in the mood, however, Hagi is a creative distributor -- and in striker 
Florin Raducioiu, he has a formidable finisher. While playing for Bari, Verona, 
Brescia and Milan in Serie A, the premier league in Italy, Raducioiu totaled 20 
goals in 89 games. He had a "golden hat trick" -- four goals -- against Faroe 
Islands in the qualifying opener and produced the game winner in last October's 
2-1 clincher over Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeper Miodrag Belodedici, who defected to Yugoslavia during the final years 
of the Ceaucescu regime before returning in 1992, is the first man to have won 
European Cups on two teams -- Steaua Bucharest and Yugoslavia's Red Star 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 The talent is there, at least whenever Iordanescu is able to assemble it in 
the same place. After the fall of Ceaucescu in 1989, Romanian players were 
finally allowed to play abroad -- and the result was mass exodus. Eight 
starters play professionally outside Romania, among them Hagi in Brescia, 
Italy; Raducioiu, AC Milan; midfielder Ionut Lupescu, Bayern Leverkusen, 
Germany, and defender Gheorghe Popescu, PSV Eindhoven, Netherlands. They are 
the holdovers from the '90 Cup team that lost to Ireland on penalty kicks in 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Iordanescu's task, after reintroductions, is to blend all his expatriates into 
a cohesive, winning unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the best conditions, that's asking an awful lot from Romania. But who 
knows? If the World Cup trophy is unable to motivate them, maybe a whiff of 
Hagi's cousin's pizza ovens will.

 * COACH: Francisco Maturana. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Carlos Valderrama, Freddy Rincon, Oscar Cordoba. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Colombia comes into the tournament as one of the hottest teams in 
the world. It has been beaten only once in the last year and is scoring goals 
with ease. Striker Faustino Asprilla is said to be destined for World Cup 
stardom, but it was the more dependable Rincon who scored the most goals in 
qualifying play. Valderrama, South America's player of the year in 1993, 
controls the action from midfield and is extremely influential. Since taking 
over from 1990 goalkeeper Rene Higuita, Cordoba has given the defense far more 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Colombia has never been as highly ranked or regarded in its 
history, and it is possible that the widely held expectations of winning the 
World Cup might unnerve the players. So much effort is put into the attack that 
the defense is occasionally left without help. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Two previous appearances. Record of 1-4-2. Best finish 
was reaching the second round in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Maturana, the coach, is a member of Colombia's 
constitutional assembly and was awarded the nation's highest honor, the Cruz de 
Boyaca, after the team's 5-0 qualifying victory over Argentina in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: As one of only two previous non-winners in the tournament with a 
legitimate chance of winning the World Cup (the other is the Netherlands), 
Colombia has the benefit of a relatively uncomplicated first round. It should 
dispose of the opposition without undue problems, but the real test will come 
if it reaches the semifinals where Brazil or the Netherlands are likely to 
stand in its way. Either match would provide a fascinating encounter.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP A PREVIEW; PLAYING IT FAST AND LOOSE; 
COLOMBIA GOES AGAINST THE NORM WITH AN ATTACKING OFFENSE THAT MAKES IT ONE OF 
THE FAVORITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "The best team from South America is Colombia. There's no doubt about that. 
They have a chance to be in the final." 
</P>
<P>
 The rose-colored view of a Colombian fan? The bold prediction of a Colombian 
player? The optimistic hope of a Colombian coach? 
</P>
<P>
 No. That glowing tribute to South America's newest soccer power came from 
Pele. If anyone can recognize talent, Pele can. After all, he inspired Brazil 
to three World Cup triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Pele says Colombia is good, it's good. 
</P>
<P>
 The team created and crafted by Coach Francisco Maturana is almost everyone's 
favorite dark horse to win the World Cup. If it does, it will be the first to 
break the monopoly of Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina, Uruguay and England, 
the only Cup winners. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a worldwide feeling that it is time a new name was engraved on the 
trophy, and the field has two legitimate candidates -- the Netherlands and 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely enough, Maturana has tried to downplay Colombia's chances. He has 
purposely diverted attention, indicating there are more important items on 
Colombia's agenda than simply success. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants nothing less than to change Colombia's international image. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Colombian sportsmen, not just soccer players, have to try to show the 
world that our country is not all bad," Maturana said last year in reference to 
Colombia's reputation as a haven for drug traffickers. "Of course we have 
problems, but there is a lot more than just the negative side." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, as the players have started to believe the World Cup is not 
beyond their reach even though Colombia never has advanced beyond the second 
round, Maturana has simply smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sin in dreaming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia's worldwide popularity is due to its style of play. Not for Colombia, 
the dour, defend-at-all-costs strategy of some other teams. Attack is the name 
of the game; attack and entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to the World Cup to enjoy ourselves," Maturana said. "If we win, 
that will be a bonus. I would rather we play well and make a good impression 
than win with the competition playing badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Since finishing third in last summer's Copa America, or South American 
Championship, in Ecuador, Colombia has been virtually unbeatable. Its biggest 
victory was the 5-0 rout of Argentina in Buenos Aires in World Cup qualifying 
play. That result rocked the soccer world and suddenly caused it to take notice 
of the Colombians. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important and impressive, however, was an earlier 2-1 victory over 
Argentina in Baranquilla that snapped Argentina's 31-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder, then, that since arriving in the United States, Colombia has 
attracted record crowds -- 57,000 in Miami to see it defeat Italian and 
European champion AC Milan, 2-1; 21,153 at Foxboro Stadium to see it beat 
Northern Ireland, 2-0; 73,511 at Giants Stadium to see it defeat Greece, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Colombia is the hot team of the moment, a fact not lost on its three 
first-round opponents: Romania, the United States and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to be a balanced team," Maturana said. "We view soccer not as 
offensive or defensive. We have to create when we have the ball and recover 
when we don't." 
</P>
<P>
 It helps, of course, to have a nucleus of world-class players, as Maturana 
does, and reserves who would be starting on most national teams. Talent in 
depth is one key to Colombia's success. 
</P>
<P>
 The pivotal player is midfielder Carlos Valderrama, South America's player of 
the year in 1987 and again in 1993. With a startling mop of hair, an apparently 
easy-going attitude and skills polished to perfection, Valderrama is, in the 
words of U.S. assistant coach Sigi Schmid, "worth the price of admission all by 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The action flows all around Valderrama, who casually strolls the midfield 
distributing perfect passes or opening up space for teammates such as fellow 
midfielder Freddy Rincon to exploit. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the media attention around the Colombian team centers on striker 
Faustino Asprilla, a brilliant forward nicknamed "the Gazelle" by Colombian 
fans. But Rincon scored five of Colombia's goals in qualifying play while 
Asprilla netted only a couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Colombia lacks for top-class forwards. In addition to Asprilla, who 
scored 10 goals this season for his Italian club, Parma, there is Adolfo 
(Train) Valencia, whose nickname says it all. He has power and speed and 
already has won one championship this year, helping Bayern Munich capture the 
Bundesliga title in Germany by scoring 11 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Victor Hugo Aristizabal has proved his goal-scoring prowess 
during the run-in to the tournament, as has Ivan Valenciano. 
</P>
<P>
 Other likely starters include defenders Luis Carlos Perea, who was impressive 
in the Copa America but was slowed by injury after that and is only now getting 
back to top form, Andres Escobar, Wilson Perez and Luis Herrera. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia's most famous player from World Cup '90, goalkeeper Rene Higuita, is 
not on the team. He fell afoul of the law in Colombia because of his 
involvement in helping negotiate the release of a kidnap victim for a fee and 
spent half a year in jail. He faces further charges and no longer is considered 
in the national-team picture. 
</P>
<P>
 His replacement is Oscar Cordoba, a less adventurous, less spectacular but 
more reliable goalkeeper. He also has the confidence to predict that "Colombia 
is going to go far in the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 The one team likely to stand in Colombia's way is Brazil, and already the 
psychological games have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia's players like to show off, but in a World Cup you have to play 
seriously," said Tele Santana, Brazil's former national-team coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia is a fine team and it has been playing together for a long time," 
said Brazil's current coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira. "But it is not used to 
playing under pressure and there will be a lot of pressure at the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Maturana, of course, has heard this all before, but he's still smiling. He 
knows his players. The pressure will be on the other teams.

<P>
 * COACH: Henri Michel. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Francois Omam-Biyick, Alphonse Tchami, Stephen Tataw. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: The sheer exuberance and unpredictability of Cameroon's play 
makes the team a pleasure to watch. The players have a gift for trying the 
unusual and the unexpected. They get speed, skill and firepower from 
Omam-Biyick and Tchami and solid defensive leadership from Tataw. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: A chaotic situation at home, where the federation is bankrupt 
and politicians have meddled constantly in team affairs, has left Cameroon 
ill-prepared for this tournament. Of course, the same thing was true in 1990 
and look what happened. Roger Milla, Cameroon's hero of Italia '90, is back, 
but he's 42 and shows it. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Two previous appearances. Record of 3-2-3. Went unbeaten 
in the first round in 1982 but still failed to advance. Best finish was 
reaching the quarterfinals in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Veterans Milla and goalkeeper Thomas N'Kono have each 
twice been chosen Africa's player of the year -- Milla in 1976 and 1990 and 
N'Kono in 1979 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Logic says this is the year Cameroon fails to get out of the first 
round, but the Africans have a habit of confounding the experts and could do so 
again. Their first-round opposition, however, is formidable. The 
Brazil-Cameroon match could be a classic. Sweden should be physically and 
tactically too strong. The Soviet Union trounced Cameroon, 4-0, in Italy last 
time around.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP B PREVIEW; A ROAR NO MORE?; CAMEROON'S 
INDOMITABLE LIONS SEEMINGLY HAVE TOO MANY OBSTACLES TO REPEAT 1990 SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Cameroon's extraordinarily entertaining and successful adventure at the 
1990 World Cup in Italy, where it became the first African team to advance to 
the quarterfinals, the Indomitable Lions went through four coaches in the next 
three years. That should have served as a warning to Coach No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henri Michel decided to find out for himself if the environment was as 
toxic as had been reported for a coach in the economically and politically 
unstable West African nation. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he soon discovered. It was worse. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived for his first training session in April, there was no bottled 
water for the players. Although that might be considered a luxury for the U.S. 
players ensconced in Mission Viejo, it is not in Cameroon, where tap water is 
undrinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 If that had been Michel's low point as Cameroon's coach, then perhaps the 
48-year-old Frenchman would not feel as if he has aged three decades in the 
last three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, reaching into his own wallet to pay for mineral water and other 
necessities has been the least of his problems, because he and his team have 
had to overcome infighting among national soccer federation officials, 
governmental interference and a dearth of resources -- especially money. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a brief summary of one day in Michel's life: 
</P>
<P>
 In late April, Cameroon was scheduled to play against Zambia, the first match 
since qualifying for the 1994 World Cup. Because the 80,000-seat stadium in the 
capital city, Yaounde, has deteriorated to the extent that the international 
soccer federation, FIFA, condemned it, the game was supposed to be played in 
Douala. The stadium there is in no better condition, but it has not undergone a 
FIFA inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments before Michel and the team were to board a bus for the three-hour 
drive to Douala, however, they were informed that the game had been canceled. 
Zambia decided not to play after receiving mixed messages from Cameroon's 
multi-headed federation about the details of the contract for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 So Michel decided that the team would remain in Yaounde for an evening 
practice that would be open to the public. But, upon arriving at the stadium at 
the appointed hour, he could find no one available to turn on the lights. He 
could not have called ahead to ask soccer officials to make someone available 
because the federation's phones had been cut off because of unpaid bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Indomitable Lions? Try Impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this might seem like an unusual approach to the soccer business for 
Michel, who coached France to the gold medal in the 1984 Olympics and to third 
place in the 1986 World Cup, it is business as usual for most of Cameroon's 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most persistent complaint is that the federation is invariably behind in 
fulfilling its commitments to pay them salaries and bonuses and compensate them 
for expenses, which was their same complaint before the 1990 World Cup. When 
their captain, goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell, took their case to the 
federation shortly before the team left for Italy, he was ordered to the bench 
for the entire tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict apparently did not negatively impact the play of his teammates. 
Nor did the fact that they were playing for a Russian coach who spoke neither 
of Cameroon's official languages, French and English. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions stunned defending champion Argentina, 1-0, in the tournament opener 
and advanced through Colombia, 2-1, in the second round before falling, 3-2, in 
a quarterfinal loss to England that was the tournament's most engaging game. 
They were such a positive force in the tournament that FIFA, hoping there were 
more teams back home like them, increased African representation in the World 
Cup from two countries to three. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Cameroonians are not incredibly talented," former national team defender 
Ayakan Yombi told the New York Times. "Our force is our strength and our faith. 
We can have all the problems in the world, but every time we put on the colors 
and play, we know that, if it goes well, the whole country will be happy. That 
pushes us to go to the wall, beyond our limits." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Lions' capacity to lift the country's spirit that has caused 
controversial President Paul Biya to adopt them. The lion even became the 
symbol of his 1992 candidacy. When political opponents called for a general 
strike on the one-year anniversary of his election, he responded by calling for 
a national holiday to celebrate the previous day's victory over Zimbabwe that 
clinched Cameroon's third World Cup berth since 1982. The strike never 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 When Michel goes to federation officials to seek money, they often respond by 
sending him to the government. On May 31, Biya announced that he had 
contributed $185,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Michel accepts Biya's money, he also must accept his counsel. That is 
why Roger Milla, 42, will become the oldest man to play in the World Cup. Milla 
left the field in 1991 to become a federation official, but he decided to come 
out of retirement earlier this year in hopes that he would be selected for the 
team. Michel really had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in Biya's defense, it must be pointed out that he also insisted that 
Milla, who already was known as "The Old Lion," be selected for the team in 
1990. All he did was score four goals in the World Cup. If the team has no 
success this year under Michel, perhaps Biya can coach. Perhaps he is the only 
one who would take the job.

 * COACH: Carlos Alberto Parreira. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Romario, Bebeto, Rai. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: The finest all-around team in the tournament, with strength in 
depth at almost every position. Strikers Romario and Bebeto are among the best 
in the world. Right back Jorginho and his understudy, Cafu, are defenders whose 
overlapping runs down the wing create numerous chances. The team has abundant 
skill in all aspects of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Midfield could be a problem. Playmaker Rai did not do well in 
his first season in France, possibly because he was played out of position. The 
defense is solid but can sometimes be caught because of the players' enthusiasm 
for joining the attack. Goalkeeping is no more than adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Fourteen previous appearances. Record of 44-11-11. Winner 
in 1958, 1962 and 1970; runner-up 1950; third place in 1938 and 1978; fourth 
place 1974. The only country to have played in every World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Brazil and Germany have played a total of 134 World Cup 
matches but have never met in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Brazil is the favorite to win it all and there is no reason to 
suspect that it will not, despite a 1-1 tie with Canada in Edmonton last week. 
The first round will provide no obstacle. The only teams that could possibly 
derail Brazilian hopes for a fourth title are Colombia and Germany.

 * COACH: Tommy Svensson. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Tomas Brolin, Martin Dahlin, Thomas Ravelli. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: The Swedish team gained huge confidence and a sense of 
togetherness by finishing third in the 1992 European Championship, played in 
Sweden. A pair of talented strikers in Dahlin and Brolin, excellent midfielders 
in Jonas Thern and Stefan Schwarz, hard-tackling defenders like Jan Eriksson 
and Roland Nilsson, and a veteran goalkeeper in Ravelli will make it a 
difficult team to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: The team seldom rises to any great height in terms of 
performance. It does well enough to win but lacks sparkle. It is fast up front 
and on the wings but a lot slower in midfield and on defense, something that 
could be exploited by Brazil and Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Eight previous appearances. Record of 11-14-6. Best 
finish was as runner-up in 1958. Was fourth in 1938 and third in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Defender Joachim Bjorklund is the nephew of Coach Tommy 
Svensson. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: After a disastrous 1990 World Cup when it lost all three matches 
and went home from Italy licking its wounds, Sweden should do much better this 
time around. On paper, it is the second-best team in its first-round group and 
will advance with ease. The luck of the draw comes into play after that, but 
the Swedes could make the final eight.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP B PREVIEW; THAT OLD FAMILIAR TUNE; 
BRAZIL'S FANS HEARTENED BY PARREIRA'S PLEDGE TO RETURN TO SAMBA SOCCER  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazil. The name is still spoken in tones bordering on reverence in the soccer 
world. Between 1958 and '70, the country's colors were worn by the most gifted 
player in the sport's history, the legendary Pele, as the national team won 
three World Cups and enchanted fans throughout the world with a style so joyous 
and graceful it was considered as much dance as sport: samba soccer . 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilians called it jogo bonito , beautiful game, and they traveled by the 
tens of thousands to watch it, incessantly playing their drums and maracas, 
waving flags and banners and wearing the same golden shirts as their heroes. 
Well, most of them wore the golden shirts. Some young women, just as on the 
beach at Rio de Janeiro, chose not to wear shirts of any color, adding to the 
carnivale atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult for fans even of the opposing team not to become swept away 
in the exuberance. Even today, most soccer enthusiasts will tell you their 
favorite team in the World Cup is their own and that their second-favorite is 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brazil of today is not the Brazil that won its last world title almost 
a quarter-century ago and its almost mystical hold over soccer fans is a 
product more of romance for days gone by than reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Planeloads of colorful, uninhibited Brazilian fans will still follow their 
team to the 1994 World Cup in the United States, and they will still turn 
first-round games in Palo Alto and Pontiac, Mich., into festivals. But they 
know better than anyone else that to describe the play of their team as jogo 
bonito is no more apt than calling today's New York Yankees "The Bronx 
Bombers." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilians prefer to blame it on Europe. In Pele's prime, which, not 
coincidentally, also was Brazil's soccer prime, the country's players remained 
at home to play professionally. According to Paul Gardner's book, "The Simplest 
Game," Italy's most fabled team, Juventus of Turin, once offered to buy Pele's 
contract from his hometown team, Santos, only to discover that Brazil's 
government had declared him a national treasure, which meant he could not be 
legally exported. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 11 of the 22 members of Brazil's national team, including eight of the 
starting 11, have opted for more lucrative deals in Europe where, according to 
Brazilians, their players develop bad habits. In fact, what they develop is an 
understanding of the modern game, which, tedious as it is, emphasizes a more 
physical, defensive, counterattacking approach. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brazil won its first title in 1958, French goalkeeper Claude Abbes said: 
"I would rather play against 10 Germans than one Brazilian." Now, Abbes might 
think he was playing against 10 Germans. Instead of hearing Sergio Mendes in 
their heads when they watch their team, Brazilian fans today hear Wagner. It 
might have an undeniable beat, but they cannot dance to it. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1990 World Cup, when Brazil, under Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni, played 
with two instead of three forwards, midfielder Dunga actually boasted: "No more 
jogo bonito . This is the Brazil of sweat and sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 It also was a Brazil that, for the third consecutive World Cup, failed to 
advance beyond the quarterfinals, losing in the second round to, of all teams, 
archrival Argentina. During that game, a Brazilian fan hoisted a banner that 
said: "IF LAZARONI IS A COACH, I'M THE POPE." Soon after, Lazaroni was not the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Carlos Alberto Parreira, who will join the United States' Bora 
Milutinovic as the only coach to guide three countries in the World Cup. 
Parreira, 51, coached Kuwait in 1982 and the United Arab Emirates in 1990. In 
between, he served his first stint as the coach of his native Brazil before 
being fired in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned, he knew all the right things to say. "The defensive football 
is not Brazil," he told World Soccer magazine. "We want to go back to our roots 
-- to the flat-back four, zonal marking and attacking football. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is how (our players) have played since they were boys. You cannot put 
Brazilian players into a (straitjacket). Brazilians play best when you leave 
them free." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the fans had pressured him into adopting that style, he said: "It is 
not so much pressure, but, yes, there is a feeling that that is the Brazilian 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira enjoyed the good will while it lasted because he knew it could not be 
saved for a rainy day. The storm came when Brazil lost its first World Cup 
qualifying game ever, 2-0 to Bolivia. "Parreira Goes Down in History," said the 
headline in one Brazilian newspaper. Brazil survived, becoming the only team to 
qualify for each World Cup since the first one in 1930, but Parreira is no more 
popular now than Lazaroni. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God I have a good family and I am financially secure," he told World 
Soccer. "Sometimes I said to myself, 'Is it really worth it? Do I want to go 
on?' You have to be a kind of Robocop to do this job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to the point where we beat Bolivia, 6-0, and one newspaper in Sao 
Paulo accused us of playing defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that criticism was unfounded, but there is little question that Brazil 
is more cautious than Parreira intended when he accepted the job. The team 
again will come to the World Cup with a two-forward attack, inciting the wrath 
of Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individually, we have good athletes, but, as a team, we are not organized," 
he told a Rio newspaper, O Globo , in a thinly veiled swipe at Parreira. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira said beautiful soccer does not work without beautiful players. "It's 
true, we lack creativity," he recently told the Associated Press. "I look, but 
I don't find it. The fact is that Brazil today doesn't have a great No. 10 
jersey any more, like a Rivelino, an Ademir da Guia or a Zico. Zico was the 
last. Give me one, and I'll put him on the team right now." 
</P>
<P>
 For that, blame it on Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gardner's book, Brazilian professional teams used to hold tryouts 
for boys 12 and up, who, even if they did not own soccer shoes would come by 
the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Social factors have undermined that system," Gardner wrote. "The breeding 
grounds that spawned all those kids have been eaten up. The massive migration 
of people to the cities has meant much less space for kids to play on. Heavy 
traffic has dealt a mortal wound to street soccer. . . . Rising standards of 
living have meant that soccer is no longer the only career option for poor 
boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Few Brazilians would disagree. They see potential stars emerging, such as 
17-year-old forward Ronaldo, but not enough to replace the veterans on this 
World Cup team, which has an average age of 28. There is a sense in Brazil of 
now or not again for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be now. The world press, oddsmakers from Las Vegas to London and even 
Coach Berti Vogts of the defending champion Germans, have made Brazil the 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 But, pelted by runaway inflation, political scandal, high crime and the recent 
death of Formula One champion Ayrton Senna, a national hero, Brazilians have 
been through too much to be optimistic about their soccer team. They were not 
encouraged by last Sunday's 1-1 tie against badly undermanned Canada in a 
friendly at Edmonton. But they are ever hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 As the song goes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil . . . "Where hearts were entertained in June, "We stood beneath an 
amber moon, "And softly murmured, 'Some day soon.' "

MAY BALK AT PUBLICITY, BUT SWEDEN IS GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME NEWS

<P>
 The road to the World Cup is fraught with bruised shins, battered bodies, 
trampled egos, frayed emotions and, if one happens to play for Sweden, one too 
many moose. 
</P>
<P>
 Klas Ingesson, star midfielder for the Swedish national soccer team, was 
nearly knocked out of the World Cup tournament in early May when the car he was 
driving struck a moose. Ingesson suffered a badly sprained neck in the 
collision and was forced to wear a neck brace for more than three weeks before 
receiving medical clearance to compete in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 This is something that seldom occurs in Cameroon, but for the Swedes, it's 
merely another occupational hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 One day you're a national hero after scoring a goal in a Cup tuneup against 
Nigeria, the next you're sidelined for three or four weeks with a sprained 
antler cruciate. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a rough go all around for the Swedes as they prepare for World Cup 
'94. Four players were injured in a May 26 "friendly" game against Denmark. 
One, defender Roger Ljung, suffered a concussion and a fractured skull after 
being elbowed in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, Sweden had to play its final two Cup qualifying matches without 
its top player, forward Tomas Brolin, who, in classic brooding Scandinavian 
form, bolted the team in exasperation over media criticism of his private life 
and an alleged drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Brolin was the lone bright spot for Sweden in an three-and-out disaster in the 
1990 World Cup at Italy, when he scored one of his country's three goals in the 
tournament -- against Brazil. He and striker Martin Dahlin combined for 10 of 
Sweden's 19 goals during 1994 qualifying, but without Brolin, the Swedes barely 
held off Finland, 3-2, to squeak into the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Brolin boycotted the media for a time before eventually rejoining the team and 
writing a first-person rebuttal for the Swedish soccer magazine, Svensk 
Fotboll. A mea culpa it was not. Brolin chastised the Swedish press for 
spreading "false rumors about me" and concluded, "The mistake I have made is 
that I have been myself in all situations. I've tried to live a normal life and 
all that it encompasses. I've socialized with my friends in my free time. It is 
something that means a lot to me. Something I have done and will always do." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin, regarded as one of the top strikers in Europe, bailed out Sweden 
against Finland, scoring the tying goal and the eventual game winner. He also 
produced equalizers against Bulgaria and France, totaling seven goals as Sweden 
finished qualifying with a record of 6-1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Svensson, the coach who held it all together, was appointed shortly 
after Sweden had flamed out in the 1990 World Cup, in which the Swedes became 
one of only four teams to lose all their games. 
</P>
<P>
 Svensson revamped the program by eliminating frills and preaching a long-ball, 
defense-oriented style that has been described as cool, calculating, efficient, 
predictable and dull -- in other words, quintessentially Swedish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in Santa Claus," Svensson grunted after his team had edged 
Finland last fall, a victory that pushed Sweden to the brink of its ninth World 
Cup. The Swedes still needed help to qualify -- they needed Israel to upset 
France in Paris -- and Svensson wasn't optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, Israel rallied for two late goals and a stunning 3-2 
victory. France was out. Sweden was in. 
</P>
<P>
 Svensson still isn't sure about flying reindeer as he and his team land in 
America, 40-1 longshots to win the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But traffic-stopping moose? 
</P>
<P>
 Yiminy, can he tell you stories.

 * COACH: Pavel Sadyrin. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Viktor Onopko, Igor Lediakhov, Sergei Yuran. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: A pair of capable, if unspectacular goalkeepers in Stanislav 
Cherchessov and Dmitri Kharine.A promising defender/midfielder in Onopko. An 
equally solid, if unimaginative midfield, anchored by Dmitri Kuznetsov and 
Lediakhov. Striker Yuran is talented, temperamental and totally unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Despite all claims to the contrary, team morale was badly hurt 
by the refusal of 14 players to play for Sadyrin. Even though more than half 
relented when faced with the possibility of missing the World Cup, the team 
will sorely miss those who continued the boycott, including such stars as 
Andrei Kanchelskis, Sergei Kiriakov and Igor Dobrovolsky. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: First appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Russia's first international goal was scored by forward 
Valeri Karpin, against Mexico in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Brazil is the World Cup favorite. Sweden finished third in the 1992 
European Championship. Cameroon was a World Cup quarterfinalist four years ago. 
Where does that leave the Russians? Probably in third place, since pride will 
be worth a victory somewhere along the line, possibly over Cameroon.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP B PREVIEW; WORKER'S REVOLT; A SQUABBLE 
BETWEEN PLAYERS AND COACH WILL KEEP RUSSIA FROM PUTTING ITS BEST TEAM FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "I nspire? Our coach couldn't teach a pig to snort . . . . Can we talk shoes? 
. . . Boris, gotta put you on hold . My agent's on line 2. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 And talking rubles. And sounding so much like the 1993 New York Mets it's 
scary. 
</P>
<P>
 While few wax poetic about the good old days of Soviet repression, life in the 
new Russian fast lane has been no political picnic during a chaotic transition 
from communism to a free market. 
</P>
<P>
 And we're only talking about the Russian soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 Torn between old and new, the Russians arrive here in tatters, having 
exhausted themselves in the process of naming their 22-man squad that will open 
play June 20 at Palo Alto against Brazil, only perhaps the best team in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, five of the nation's top players, defiant to the end, were left 
behind: wingers Igor Dobrovolsky and Andrei Kanchelskis and forwards Sergei 
Kiriakov, Igor Kolyvanov and Igor Shalimov. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of this disunity, Coach Pavel Sadyrin has said of the Moscow 
Five: "They don't exist as far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 " OK, comrades, now let's go win a few for the mother country. " 
</P>
<P>
 The borscht hit the fan last winter and cut along ideological lines. Since the 
breakup of the Soviet Union, several of Russia's top players, suddenly free 
agents, signed lucrative deals with European clubs and tasted the free market. 
</P>
<P>
 The national team, however, is still run by the old Soviet apparatus -- the 
Russian Soccer Union -- which was accustomed to keeping players under thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 You could see the collision coming from the Kremlin to the Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, after losing a qualifying match to Greece, 14 of the national 
team's players signed a letter to Shamil Tarpischev, Boris Yeltsin's adviser 
for sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The players complained about Sadyrin, their coach, and demanded that Anatoli 
Byshovets the former national team coach, be reinstated. They also denounced 
what they considered meager pay and poor training conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the crux of the issue was a shoe contract the Soccer Union signed with 
Reebok without consent from the players, many of whom had separate shoe deals 
with other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 This was, of course, the problem that Michael Jordan, a Nike man, faced as a 
member of the 1992 Olympic basketball team, sponsored by Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan "solved" his problem on the gold medal podium by covering the Reebok 
emblem with an American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, the prospect of this sort of thing happening in Russia would have been 
unthinkable. In fact, the Jordan incident surely would have amused Soviet 
propagandists in the war against imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Lenin turn over in his tomb? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mixed bag," said Robert Edelman, a professor of Russian history at UC 
San Diego. "Is the ego and greed of western sports admirable? Now that is part 
of the Russian system. But before, the bureaucrats told them what to do, and 
that wasn't good either." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman has been closely watching the exploits of the Russian soccer team. He 
recently authored a book, "Serious Fun: History of Spectator Sport in the 
USSR," and will serve as a World Cup correspondent for Sports Express, a daily 
independent newspaper in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the initial rebellion, most of the Russian soccer players backed down 
from their ultimatums, deciding to put country first. 
</P>
<P>
 The players had little recourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, the Russian soccer union, led by President Viacheslav Koloskov, 
staunchly backed Sadyrin. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to say there will no hard feelings. Edelman says players are rebelling 
against the old system, of which Sadyrin was a part. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is known as a good, tough coach," Edelman said, "but is probably not the 
best personality to coach an all-star team. You're dealing with fairly inflated 
egos, something he is not used to. He's from the old school of Soviet coaches, 
which were more dictatorial." 
</P>
<P>
 The internal bickering is bound to have an effect on Russian fortunes. While 
not considered tournament favorites, they would have been considered a 
formidable opponent before the implosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Forgotten Five, Kiryakov was a star forward for Karlsruhe, a German 
club. Shalimov was a $1-million midfielder for Italy's Inter Milan, and 
Kanchelskis was a top midfielder for Manchester United in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Edelman does not envision Russia reaching the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that Russian soccer in the new era appears more suited to 
becoming a world soccer power. For a nation of its population, the Soviet Union 
had finished no better than fourth -- 1966 -- in seven World Cup appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman contends soccer suffered under the old regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The travesty of the Soviet system," Edleman explained, "was they they won all 
these (Olympic) medals in sports nobody cared about. In the one sport everyone 
cared about, soccer, they had trouble internationally. I think the Olympic 
sports drained the athletic talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Sadyrin conceded recently that winning the World Cup would be "a miracle 
on the scale of flying saucers." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the Russians are not without hope, nor talent. They are led by forwards 
Vladimir Bestchatnykh, Sergei Yuran and Alexander Mostovoi and a pair of 
quality goalkeepers: Dmitri Kharine and Stanislav Cherchessov. 
</P>
<P>
 And never underestimate the power of greed. If the Russians advance to the 
round of 16, each player will receive a $20,000 bonus, about what the average 
Russian can expect to earn in a decade.

 * COACH: Xavier Azkargorta. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Erwin Sanchez, Luis Hector Cristaldo, Julio Cesar Baldivieso. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Bolivia has speed and skill aplenty, with a fondness for playing 
possession soccer and attacking down the wings. Sanchez, nicknamed "Platini" 
after former French star Michel Platini, is a playmaking midfielder of some 
note. Baldivieso is in form and has played well recently. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: The loss of Marco Etcheverry, who suffered torn knee ligaments 
in November and is on the team but seems unlikely to play, will hurt. So will 
not having the advantage of playing at high altitude, as the Bolivians do in La 
Paz. They also are likely to be intimidated by physically stronger and larger 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Two previous appearances. Record of 0-3-0. Never advanced 
beyond the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Azkargorta, a Basque from Spain, was chosen Bolivia's man 
of the year in 1993 after the team's successful qualifying run. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: With little experience at this level, a relatively young team and 
strong opposition, it is difficult to envision Bolivia lasting long in the 
tournament. The key to a possible third-place finish in the first round will be 
the match against South Korea.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP C PREVIEW; COMING TO ITS OWN DEFENSE; 
GERMANY HAS BEEN AT OR NEAR THE TOP IN THE LAST FIVE WORLD CUPS AND THAT ISN'T 
EXPECTED TO CHANGE THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last quarter-century, Germany has been the dominant force in 
international soccer. No other nation has come close, not Brazil, not 
Argentina, not anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wishing to contest that claim need only to look at the Germans' record 
over the past two decades. To say it is impressive is a huge understatement. 
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 Germany has won the World Cup twice in that time (1974 and 1990), finished 
second twice (1982 and 1986) and third once (1970). 
</P>
<P>
 Germany also has won the European Championship twice in that time (1972 and 
1980), finished second twice (1976 and 1992) and third once (1988). 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, previously the best team in the world, has stumbled badly over the 
past 20 years. Its high point was achieved in Mexico in 1970 when it won the 
World Cup for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, meanwhile, has been a formidable challenger, but even staunch 
Argentine supporters would have to admit their country's record, while 
excellent, is not as good as Germany's. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the Germans' secret? How does the country year after year manage to 
produce national teams that invariably are favored to win whatever tournament 
they enter? 
</P>
<P>
 Franz Beckenbauer, who led the Germans to their 1974 World Cup triumph as team 
captain and coached them to their 1990 victory, believes the answer lies in the 
national character. 
</P>
<P>
 The German players are not better than anyone else, Beckenbauer argues, but 
they have self-confidence and a never-give-up attitude that demonstrates itself 
time and again on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany can be very dangerous when it is trailing. In perhaps the most famous 
example, it was down, 2-0, to Argentina in the 1986 World Cup final in Mexico 
City, but fought back to tie the score before eventually losing, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Beckenbauer's successor, Berti Vogts, is preparing to take on the most 
difficult assignment in soccer: successfully defending the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The feat has been achieved twice: by Italy, which won back-to-back titles in 
1934 and 1938, and by Brazil, which matched that achievement in 1958 and 1962. 
But Vogts, a defender who was nicknamed "The Terrier" and who was a member of 
Germany's 1974 World Cup winner, believes his team has the ability to retain 
its crown. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, much has happened since that hot night in 1990 when a 
penalty-kick goal by Andreas Brehme was all that separated Lothar Matthaeus' 
Germany from Diego Maradona's Argentina in Rome's Olympic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Germany is reunited, East and West having come together 
politically and in a soccer sense three winters ago. That gives Vogts a bigger 
pool of players from which to choose, although only a few former East German 
players -- notably Matthias Sammer -- have successfully made the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 More important is the fact that many of the 1990 veterans are still on the 
team, including goalkeeper Bodo Illgner, defenders Guido Buchwald and Juergen 
Kohler, midfielders Thomas Haessler and Matthaeus and forwards Juergen 
Klinsmann, Karlheinz Riedle and, somewhat surprisingly, 34-year-old Rudi 
Voeller. 
</P>
<P>
 A new generation of stars also is coming into its own. Look for players such 
as Stefan Effenberg and Andreas Moeller to have considerable impact in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Moeller inspired Germany to a 2-1 victory over Brazil in Cologne last year in 
a match that was not only Germany's 600th international but also Matthaeus' 
104th, breaking Beckenbauer's record. 
</P>
<P>
 Moeller, a creative midfielder who will be relied on to provide the ammunition 
for strikers Klinsmann and Riedle in the World Cup, scored the game-winner and 
turned in an excellent performance against an admittedly weak Brazilian team 
that lacked Bebeto and Romario. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his performance encouraged Vogts, who has not been afraid to experiment 
with his lineup since a lackluster Germany finished second to Denmark in the 
1992 European Championship in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's defense has been Vogts' main concern, especially with central 
defenders Buchwald and Koehler being older and less nimble. The latest 
adjustment the coach has tried is to move Matthaeus from midfield to sweeper, 
and the move seems to be working reasonably well. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other nations, which can afford to slip occasionally and not be too 
heavily criticized, Germany, as world champion, is expected to be perfect every 
time it takes the field. The German press is relentless in pointing out bad 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team is always under pressure," Moeller said. "People expect first-class 
performances." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism of Germany has always been that it does not play attractive 
soccer. Effective, certainly, but not attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans rely on superb organization and tactical discipline, excellent 
physical condition and a fearless approach to the game. They are always a 
difficult team to beat, but they can also be a difficult team to watch, 
especially for those who prefer the fluid skills and unexpected improvisations 
of, say, Brazil or Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Germany does have its skilled players. Haessler, who is blessed with an 
astonishing free kick, is but one example. Another is Klinsmann, whose speed 
and deadly shot make him Germany's most dangerous forward. 
</P>
<P>
 But Germany has had trouble scoring goals over the past few months and Vogts 
has tried all sorts of combinations up front. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not for want of trying, however. Anyone who has watched the team in 
practice knows how each German player loves firing the ball at the net with all 
the power he can muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, however, not that many shots have gone in. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses to Argentina last December and to Ireland last month have Vogts alerted 
to the fact that all is not well, that the team still needs some fine-tuning. 
Even a 5-1 victory over Austria in the team's final preparatory match before 
leaving Europe did not allay his fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not have opponents (in the World Cup) who will give us a victory on a 
plate like today," he said. "We will not be able to become world champions with 
a performance like this. We will have to perform much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Germany scored a 2-0 victory over Canada in Toronto. Despite 
obvious superiority, Germany still failed to fire on all cylinders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We failed to take a lot of chances," Vogts said. "We can't do that against 
Bolivia (in Saturday's opening match)." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus was less worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more in this team than we have shown," he said. "It is important to 
take your chances, but the team has played fluidly. I'm still confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not quite there yet, but we will be where we want to be for the World 
Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is the oddsmakers' (and Vogts') favorite to win the World Cup. But when 
the tournament starts, Germany will be right there. 
</P>
<P>
 If the past quarter-century has taught soccer fans anything, it's that fact.

<P>
 * COACH: Berti Vogts. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Juergen Klinsmann, Andreas Moeller, Lothar Matthaeus. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Disciplined, well-organized and exceptionally experienced, the 
Germans are again among the favorites. As defending champions, they know what 
it takes to pace themselves through the seven matches needed to win the Cup. 
Klinsmann leads the attack. Moeller, helped by Thomas Haessler, will organize 
the midfield, and Matthaeus is supposed to hold the defense intact. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: If Klinsmann can be stopped, Germany has struggled to find 
another consistent goal scorer. The defense is either well-seasoned or ready to 
crumble, depending on the viewpoint. Heat could be a factor in making the older 
players feel their age. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Twelve previous appearances. Record of 39-15-14. Winner 
in 1954, 1974, 1990; runner-up in 1966, 1982 and 1986; third in 1934 and 1970; 
fourth in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Former German star Wolfgang Overath is the only player in 
history to have played on teams that finished first, second and third in the 
World Cup, doing so in 1974, 1966 and 1970, respectively. If Germany finishes 
third in this tournament, several other players will join him, since Germany 
has been second and first in the last two Cups. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Germany has benefited from having perhaps the easiest of the 
first-round groups. It is impossible to see Bolivia, Spain or South Korea 
giving Germany any difficulties. The organization of the competition puts the 
Germans on track to meet Argentina or Italy somewhere along the way. If they 
are not upset then, they will be in the final for a record fourth consecutive 
time.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP C PREVIEW; IT'S THE FEIGN IN SPAIN; 
DESPITE CLUB SUCCESSES, NATION CAN'T MASTER CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all of its history and club-level success with such powers as Barcelona 
and Real Madrid, Spain has done almost nada in World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
 On one fourth-place finish, in 1950, a soccer-breathing nation does not hang 
its hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, mind you, formed its first club in 1898. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-two punch of Spanish Civil War and World War II certainly knocked 
Spain's international game on its ear for a time, but what of the rest of a 
century? 
</P>
<P>
 Spain is making its ninth World Cup appearance, fifth consecutive, the 
previous eight having been mostly forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, it was eliminated by Yugoslavia in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Spain remains a mecca on the club scene. Foreigners flock to play on the 
talent-rich teams. Once, the great Maradona flocked. In fact, convinced 
outsiders were undermining the international cause, Spain banned foreigners 
from 1963 to 1973, with dubious results: It failed even to qualify for the Cup 
in 1970 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, while the ban on foreigners was lifted in 1973, Spain's World Cup fog has 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Intent on an image make-over is Javier Clemente, Spain's candid and 
controversial coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than try to assemble a team of assorted parts, Clemente named nine 
members of one club, Barcelona, to Spain's 22-man national squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked a squad I believe will be competitive as a compact unit," Clemente 
said after the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Barcelona remains a European club power, having won its fourth consecutive 
Spanish League title and advancing to the European Champions Cup before losing 
to Italy's AC Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Clemente cannot take Barcelona's best players, two of the 
world's best: Romario of Brazil and Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clemente hopes that infusing a club flavor in the national team will push 
Spain closer to the promised land. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain is far from a favorite and, playing in Group C, will have to spar 
against the likes of Germany, the defending World Cup champion, and Bolivia, a 
South American up-and-comer that defeated powerful Brazil in a qualifying 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 By Clemente's choice, Spain will field mostly midfielders and defenders, which 
might be construed as a conservative approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The only forwards on the roster are Julio Salinas of Barcelona, Felipe 
Minambres of Tenerife, Luis Enrique Martinez of Real Madrid and Juan (Juanele) 
Castano. . 
</P>
<P>
 The best of the bunch is Salinas, who scored seven goals in World Cup 
qualifying games. Salinas is a two-time World Cup veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's most exciting young player is Julen Guerrero, a 20-year-old midfielder 
and rising star from the northern port of Bilbao, the city that formed Spain's 
first club, Athletic de Bilbao, nearly 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero has scored 28 goals in league play the past two seasons. The 
baby-faced Guerrero was voted Spain's best native player. 
</P>
<P>
 Andoni Zubizarreta, Spain's 32-year-old goalkeeper, has a national-record 86 
international appearances but will miss the opener against South Korea because 
he was ejected from the final qualifying game against Denmark.

 * COACH: Javier Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Andoni Zubizarreta, Julen Guerrero, Julio Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Spain's 22 players are drawn entirely from the Spanish League, 
including nine from FC Barcelona, so the players know each other well. 
Goalkeeper Zubizarreta has vast experience and is Spain's all-time leader in 
international appearances with 86. Guerrero, 20, is the team's future star, a 
midfielder of exceptional skill in both setting up plays and finishing them. 
Salinas is a striker who can't keep his place on the Barcelona team yet scores 
goals with regularity for the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Difficult to pinpoint on a team noted more for its industrious 
nature than for any outstanding quality. Zubizarreta recently was fired by 
Barcelona, which might inspire him to prove the club wrong or might have 
shattered his confidence. If Clemente is too cautious and does not give the 
rising stars a chance to shine, Spain will look ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Eight previous appearances. Record of 13-12-7. Best 
finish was fourth place in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Spain has lost only two matches since Clemente took 
charge in 1992--to European champion Denmark and, surprisingly, to Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Neither Bolivia nor South Korea should pose any major difficulty in 
the first round and Spain should reach the last 16 with ease. 
</P>

 * COACH: Kim Ho. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Hwang Sun-nong, Kim Joo-sung, Choi In-young. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: The offense boasts above-average speed, determination and a fair 
amount of technical skill.Midfielder Kim Joo-sung played on the 1986 and 1990 
World Cup teams and has twice been named Asia's player of the year. Seo 
Jung-won, another midfielder, is one of the fastest players in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Youth, lack of international experience and a lack of 
self-confidence are the main difficulties the Koreans have to overcome. Their 
defense is somewhat naive and not as tenacious as it should be once beaten. The 
team's sometimes overly enthusiastic, not to say rough play could result in 
problems with referees. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Three previous appearances. Record of 0-7-1. Never 
advanced beyond the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: South Korea's technical adviser, Anatoli Byshovets, 
coached the Soviet Union's gold medal-winning side in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: South Korea will have good fan support in Dallas and is talented 
enough to score its first World Cup victory by defeating Bolivia and thereby 
possibly reaching the second round.

HOST ROLE IN 2002 IS ON SOUTH KOREA'S WISH LIST

<P>
 Last October, Japan and South Korea met in a World Cup qualifier in Doha, 
Qatar, that had as much to do with century-old hatreds as it did with soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Koreans, the old wounds of Japanese occupation and subjugation 
resurfaced after their 1-0 defeat. Seoul newspapers called it, "The Second 
Great Insult," a biting reference to the day in 1910 that Japan's army took 
down the flag and Koreans became subjects of Japan's emperor. 
</P>
<P>
 The day is known as the "Great Insult," and 50 years of colonization did 
nothing to erode the bitter feelings, which spilled over into the stadium in 
Qatar. 
</P>
<P>
 In soccer terms, the loss was equally devastating. South Korea's chances of 
earning a Cup berth diminished considerably after the defeat. Japan simply 
needed a victory over Iraq to earn its first berth; South Korea needed a couple 
of miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, after the qualifying round's final games a few days later, South Korea, 
not Japan, was celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 In the span of about 30 seconds in separate stadiums, South Korea rode an 
emotional roller-coaster to qualify for its fourth World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 First, South Korea defeated North Korea, 3-0, while elsewhere in the city 
Japan was leading Iraq, 2-1. But in the closing moments, Iraq tied the score on 
a header from Jaffar Omram Salman to ruin Japan's quest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was over for us, then all of a sudden it wasn't," Gu Sang-bum, 
South Korean captain, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 It might take more miracles for the Koreans to advance past the first round. 
South Korea plays Spain in its opener June 17 at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. It 
also faces defending champion Germany and Bolivia in Group C. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 in Italy, the Koreans lost all three of their games -- 2-0 to Belgium, 
3-1 to Spain and 1-0 to Uruguay. But in 1986 in Mexico, South Korea earned 
international respect when it tied Bulgaria, 1-1, lost to eventual champion 
Argentina, 3-1, and lost to defending champion Italy, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In its only other Cup appearance, South Korea failed miserably, losing to 
Hungary, 9-0, and Turkey, 7-0, in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to admit that we are slightly behind the other teams," said Kim Ho, 
the Korean coach who began his career on the high school level in 1976. "We are 
competing to reach the final 16. Our best chance is to beat Bolivia. But we are 
not afraid of any team. If we use our skills well, then we can expect some 
surprises." 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea is led by Kim Joo-sung, a veteran of the last two Cups and who was 
Asia's player of the year in 1989. Kim gained invaluable seasoning this year 
with VfL Bochum in the German Bundesliga. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koreans rely on speed to offset the finely honed technical skill of the 
Europeans and South Americans. But South Korea is weak in the goal and team 
members lack endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has tried to correct the latter in training. Twice a week the players run 
from sea level to the summit of the country's highest peak, 6,400-foot Mt. 
Hallasan, and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer was not popular in the country until after the 1910 occupation. It then 
remained the most popular sport until about 10 years ago when baseball captured 
the nation's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some think its current resurgence could be linked to South Korea's record this 
summer. If it advances to the second round, some officials say South Korea 
would enhance its chances to play host to the 2002 Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Its competition is Japan, the favorite to win the role of host. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian rivals want to play host to the region's first World Cup for the 
obvious economic benefits. But South Korea has offered to sponsor it jointly 
with communist North Korea, and has used it as a political ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are awarded the chance, it will no doubt contribute greatly to 
reunifying South and North Korea," said Chung Moon-jong, federation president. 
</P>
<P>
 So who knows, perhaps another unexpected occurrence will change the course of 
history for Korean soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened in Qatar. 
</P>
<P>
 It could happen again.

 * COACH: Dimitar Penev. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Hristo Stoichkov, Emil Kostadinov, Krasimir Balakov. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: There is enough firepower in the front line to provide the goals, 
with Stoichkov a world-class striker and Kostadinov having shown his touch in 
qualifying play.The defense is well marshaled by Petar Houbtchev. Balakov is a 
midfielder leader with a fine free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Stoichkov's fiery temperament could land him in trouble with 
World Cup referees, who will be strict. If he is banished, Bulgaria's hopes 
will vanish because the team has no other truly outstanding performers. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Five previous appearances. Record of 0-10-6. Best finish 
was second round in Mexico '86. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Penev, the coach and former central defender, played in 
the 1966, 1970 and 1974 World Cup tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: In a group featuring four teams with obvious weaknesses, Bulgaria 
has the ability to make the second round. It should beat Greece and could cause 
Argentina problems in a potential free-for-all battle in Dallas in the last 
first-round match.

 * COACH: Clemens Westerhof. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Rashidi Yekini, Stephen Keshi, Daniel Amokachi. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: The Nigerian team is the only World Cup participant to have been 
tested this year in a real tournament. It won the African Nations Cup in 
Tunisia in March. Yekini, the top striker in the Portuguese League, was the 
leading scorer in the Nations Cup and was voted Africa's player of the year in 
one poll. Most starters on the team are playing professionally with leading 
clubs in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: World Cup nerves could come into play, as can the distractions 
of the United States, although Westerhof rules with an iron hand. 
Administrative problems and internal bickering among federation officials could 
be disruptive. The defense is something of a question mark. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: First appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Nigeria already has made its mark at the junior level, 
winning the inaugural under-17 world championship in 1985 and finishing second 
in 1987. It also finished second in the 1989 under-20 world championship but 
was stripped of the silver medal for using over-age players. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Nigeria is poised to be the surprise team of 1994. It has talent 
aplenty, is not in an especially difficult group and certainly will advance to 
the second round, quite possibly as the group winner, even though Argentina is 
the logical favorite.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP D PREVIEW; NEW KING OF AFRICA; NIGERIA 
IS BEST OF CONTINENT -- AND MIGHT SOON BE ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD 
</P>

<P>
 While teams such as Brazil, Italy and the Netherlands are coming to America 
with the intention of succeeding Germany as champion, others no doubt would be 
satisfied to become recognized as the Cameroon of the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 How the sport's followers did rhapsodize! Exciting, entertaining, exhibitors 
of great promise for the future, they said of the 1990 Indomitable Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Cameroon, which appears to have fallen into the morass that is swallowing 
the entire country, again would like to be found worthy of those descriptions. 
This time, however, they are more likely to fit its African neighbor -- the 
Super Eagles of Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa's most populous nation long has been considered a sleeping giant in 
soccer, but it woke up to qualify for the World Cup, then reinforced its 
position as the continent's new power by winning Africa's Nations Cup in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Much credit belongs to Coach Clemens Westerhof, an embattled Dutchman who was 
arrogant enough to take on the country's politicized sports administration and 
emerge a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was any doubt before about whether Westerhof was in charge of 
Nigeria's World Cup effort, there was none after the final qualifying game last 
October against Algeria. When the president of the Nigerian Sports Commission, 
Chief Alex Akiyele, attempted to enter the dressing room at halftime to discuss 
strategy with the Super Eagles, Westerhof called him a comedian and locked him 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibiting no sense of humor, Akiyele called a special meeting of the 
federation to fire the coach, accusing him of offering illegal cash bonuses to 
his players. But, considering that Westerhof had led Nigeria to its first World 
Cup berth with a tie in Algiers, the chief had less chance of succeeding than 
if he had tried to part the Niger River. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dream come true, the fulfillment of a national goal and the crowning 
of Nigeria's soccer history," a Nigerian newspaper, the Daily Champion, said 
the day after the team had qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months later, exclamation points were added. When Westerhof's team won 
the Nations Cup for the first time since 1980, the question no longer was 
whether he could keep his job but which job in Nigeria he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Dictator presumably was the only one beyond his grasp. Nigeria's military 
ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, does not allow challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was more aware that Westerhof and his team had provided a welcome 
diversion from the country's political and economic turmoil than Abacha, who 
sought to capitalize by establishing himself as the team's No. 1 fan. On the 
day before the Nations Cup final in Tunisia, he spoke to the team for an hour 
by telephone from Lagos, an address that later was replayed to millions of 
Nigerians on state television. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Super Eagles beat Zambia, 2-1, the next day for the championship, it 
was a signal to many within the soccer world that players from the country's 
long-successful youth program had come of age and that Nigeria soon would 
dominate the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even predicted that Nigeria in the perhaps not-so-distant future would 
become the first African team to win the World Cup. The only African team that 
has reached as far as the quarterfinals was Cameroon in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 40 players active in European professional leagues, Nigeria 
certainly has more depth than Cameroon, leading Westerhof to boast he had three 
quality players for every position. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've proven we're a good side, with great individual players," forward 
Victor Ikpeba said. "There is so much talent, we could form two different sides 
and still be the best in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, with star striker Rashidi Yekini tiring after scoring five goals 
in the first four games of the Nations Cup, Emmanuel Amunike made his 
tournament debut in the championship game and scored both goals in the victory 
over Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
 Yekini, 30, is a superb finisher, scoring eight of Nigeria's 17 goals in the 
World Cup qualifying rounds. Also known for his bluntness, a frequent target of 
his broadsides is Westerhof. 
</P>
<P>
 This team is better than Cameroon's of '90, as explosive on offense and less 
likely to implode on defense. But Nigerians are even more optimistic about the 
future. After winning the world youth championship in 1985 and finishing second 
two years later, the Nigerians proved their under-17 players are still among 
the world's best by winning again last year. Assistant coach Fanny Ikhayere 
Amun said recently he is convinced the Super Eagles will be contenders for the 
World Cup title by 2002.

 * COACH: Alkis Panagoulias. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Antonis Minou, Dimitris Saravakos, Tassos Mitropoulos. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: None to speak of, it seems. Goalkeeper Minou has experience and 
will need it, but he's 35.Saravakos boasts an excellent free kick, but he's 32. 
Mitropoulos provides the leadership and inspiration, but he's 36. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Far too many ancient Greeks. There are more over-30 players on 
the squad than on any other team. The defense is a shambles when faced by 
top-class opposition, and Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta, Nigeria's Rachidi 
Yekini and Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov will be lining up to take target 
practice. The team appears out of its depth at this level. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: First appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: The Greek team's mascot in the tournament is a fox named 
Penelope, in honor of the Homeric heroine. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: After doing well to qualify, especially in finishing ahead of 
Russia, the Greeks have stumbled in warm-up games. They will have vociferous 
crowd support, but each of their three first-round opponents has the ability to 
defeat them and probably will.

 * COACH: Alfio Basile. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Gabriel Batistuta, Claudio Caniggia, Diego Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Excellent forward line, with Italian-basedstarters Batistuta, 
Caniggia and Abel Balbo supplied by midfielders Maradona, Leonardo Rodrigues 
and Diego Simeone.Sergio Goycochea is the best penalty-stopping goalkeeper in 
the world but has been inconsistent lately and backup Luis Islas is being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Defense is very suspect. Veteran Oscar Ruggeri is prone to 
injuries. Others have been exposed, particularly when confronted by speed. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Ten previous appearances. Record of 24-15-9. Winner in 
1978 and 1986; runner-up in 1930 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Had then-coach Cesar Luis Menotti chosen Maradona for 
Argentina's 1978 World Cup team, this would have been Maradona's fifth World 
Cup, tying the record held by Mexico's Antonio Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: A great deal depends on Maradona's ability to get the ball to the 
strikers. Argentina is capable of reaching the quarterfinals with relative 
ease, although either Nigeria or Bulgaria could upset it in the first round. 
Susceptible to being knocked out any time thereafter.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP D PREVIEW; MODERN GREEK HEROES; FORMER 
U.S. COACH PANAGOULIAS AT THE HELM OF NATION'S RISE TO PROMINENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The gods must be happy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, after all, the Mount Olympus crowd -- Zeus, Hermes, Apollo, that bunch 
-- who inspired the Olympic Games. But only now, so many sunbaked summers 
later, is there finally a local rooting interest in an off-year international 
athletics extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks, 2,000 years after they got the world playing, are in America to 
play in their first World Cup. Don't laugh. They think they have a fighting 
chance for a second-round berth. 
</P>
<P>
 With all due respect to Hellenic prowess, the main ingredient for this year's 
European-newcomer success story is as much peanut butter as pita bread. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Alketas (Alkis) Panagoulias. He is the national team coach and a 
legend in Greece, larger than life. He is Poseidon, spanner of the seas, a 
thoroughly Greek hero who happens also to be an immigrant to the United States, 
an American citizen for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In suburban Vienna, Va., where Panagoulias has lived for a decade, his Greek 
role has made him a latter-day celebrity: the only American coach in the World 
Cup, he likes to say. Of course, nobody in any Vienna noticed those obscure 
years, 1982-85, when Panagoulias coached the U.S. national team, and the 
American team at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't changed since. Panagoulias, 60, is an inspirational coach of 
no-secrets soccer with a simple credo: "Attack from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 He likes a simple, fast, aggressive game. To play it, he has assembled a team 
of believers fervent enough to retake Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in deep waters and we must learn to swim," Panagoulias says. "This is 
Greek soccer's big chance to get known around the world. Our biggest weapon is 
our fighting spirit and the burning desire to win. Our weakness is that we 
often lose our concentration during a match and this may prove disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
 In May tune-ups, Greece lost big to Cameroon and England but played to 
respectable ties against Cup-bound Bolivia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing better with each passing day. The team did better than in the 
previous friendlies; I expect to be ready when the time of truth comes," 
Panagoulias said after the U.S. game. 
</P>
<P>
 A more telling harbinger of the Greek future might have come last weekend in 
New York, where new power Colombia walloped Greece, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious professional soccer is only about one decade old in Greece, and crowds 
average only about 10,000 for Sunday matches. Still, when Panagoulias was 
rehired in 1992 to the coaching job he had held from 1973-81, Greece had failed 
in a dozen consecutive attempts to qualify for the Cup. A 1-1 tie with Russia 
on May 23, 1993, ended the drought and left Greece giddy. 
</P>
<P>
 If Zeus really had been paying attention, Greece wouldn't have to make its 
debut against superpower Argentina. But Panagoulias has a plan he thinks will 
get a boost from enthusiastic Greeks and Greek-Americans at first-round games 
in Boston and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tying the Argentines and beating either Nigeria or Bulgaria, Panagoulias says, 
should be enough to let Greece slide into the second round as a third-place 
qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing certain is that Greece will play with passion: "I want your soul 
fully dedicated to this team," Panagoulias told an early draft of Cup hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
 To carry the flag further than Greece has traveled in soccer, Panagoulias has 
assembled a team that blends youth and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece's greatest hopes ride on the feet of 21-year-old striker phenom Nikos 
Machlas. What he lacks in experience, Machlas makes up in exuberance and smart 
positioning, particularly inside the penalty area. He might become the first 
Greek recruited to play abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterpoint to young Machlas is high-scoring 36-year-old Tassos Mitropoulos, 
the dean of the Greek team, who has played in more than 70 international 
matches and is nicknamed "Rambo" for his explosive attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans Nikos Tsiantakis, the team's best left-footer, and Panagiotis 
Tsalouhidis will anchor the midfield and could trouble opposition defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense should focus on right back Stratos Apostolakis, who has played 
nearly 60 international matches and is considered one of the best Greek players 
in the past decade. The goalkeeper will be another veteran, 35-year-old Antonis 
Minou, at 6-feet-4 the tallest player on a big team. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they do well at the finals they'll be treated as gods," soccer official 
Alexis Dedes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you listening, Zeus?

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP D PREVIEW; TURMOIL'S TEAM; ARGENTINA 
HAS KNACK FOR TURNING BAD FORTUNE AND BAD FEELINGS INTO GOOD RESULTS 
</P>

<P>
 Something will happen. Some collapse or crisis or catastrophe will present 
itself and the national soccer team of Argentina will be delirious with joy. 
Infighting, attacks from without, injuries and feuds: At last, the proper 
ambience in which to conduct a World Cup campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to discount the importance of the disasters that already have 
befallen Argentina, as seen from the Argentines' point of view: the ill-advised 
selection of an inappropriate coach, the unfairly harsh multiple-month 
suspensions of their two best players for cocaine use, and cruel opponents with 
dirty tactics during World Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the helpful items. 
</P>
<P>
 Now come the daily, almost hourly updates of outrage from the team's fading 
and portly star, whose threats to quit the team are as frequent as his trips to 
the snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
 What to expect of Argentina, a team historically possessed of players of 
singular brilliance and verve and often equally bad manners? Expect the team to 
concoct something, some obstacle that will elevate its mental sharpness to the 
level of its physical skill. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the team that has found a kind of perverse buoyancy in moments of 
deepest despair. Witness the team's rebound in the 1990 World Cup after losing 
its starting goalkeeper to a broken leg 12 minutes into the second game. The 
backup, Sergio Goycochea, emerged as the King of the Shootout because of his 
uncanny knack for saving penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing needed to be manufactured to motivate the Argentine team or fans 
during the prolonged World Cup qualifying. Argentina lurched through its South 
American qualifying group with the sort of hubris that describes much of the 
team's approach to opponents, no matter how impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina expects to win, usually without much effort but with a great show of 
style. Mowing down the teams in its group and qualifying for the World Cup 
finals was such a given that few Argentines discussed much more than to which 
city their team might be assigned in the draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the team's skin-of-the-teeth qualification campaign came, at first, as a 
shock to Argentina's fans. A familiar wave of fickleness overcame them, and 
throughout Argentina fans began to allow as how anyone could have seen this 
coming with Coach Alfio Basile and that broken-down wreck of a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost among the wreckage was that Argentina went into qualifying with a 33-game 
international winning streak, having won back-to-back South American 
championships. All was forgotten when Colombia beat Argentina, 2-1, in 
Barranquilla. Worse, Argentina played to a scoreless draw against Paraguay two 
games later, then finished with a 5-0 loss to Colombia in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina had the back-against-the-wall environment in which it thrives, so it 
should be no surprise that everything worked. First, Paraguay could manage only 
a tie with Peru on the same day that Argentina was being trounced by Colombia. 
That left Argentina tied for second with Paraguay in its qualifying group, but 
with the advantage in tiebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 That sent Argentina into a home-and-home playoff with a representative from 
the Oceania group, Australia, for the last place in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Basile knew the direness of the situation and he acted accordingly. He called 
up Diego Maradona. The 33-year-old legend had been in recent years reduced to a 
role of team mascot, but Basile knew the boost Maradona would provide. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach knew best and Maradona -- thanks to a crash diet and yet another 
stab at serious training -- did make a difference. The start wasn't 
encouraging: The teams played to a 1-1 draw in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 17, 1993, the final game of the two years of World Cup qualifying was 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina had one more advantage -- playing at home, in massive River Plate 
Stadium in Buenos Aires. Argentina outplayed Australia, but neither team could 
score. Another tie was too disastrous to contemplate. But disaster chose 
Australia. One of its defenders inadvertently knocked the ball into his own 
net, and Argentina won in a most unlikely manner: 1-0, on an own goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina made it, slinking in through the World Cup's back door. 
</P>
<P>
 In the relief of the victory, fans adopted an I-knew-it-all-along attitude, 
but Basile and the team remembered every slight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Argentina will be among the top four (in the World Cup), and that will shut 
our critics' mouths," Basile said. "In this country, talk is cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 So Argentina is in, drawn into Group D with Nigeria, Bulgaria and Greece with 
its base in Boston. The Argentines should have little trouble advancing from 
their group, except for an expected strong performance from Nigeria. In fact, 
despite its record in qualifying, Argentina is considered among the 
tournament's favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 That might be because of Argentina's special relationship with the World Cup. 
Looking at the country's international record, some would conclude the team was 
merely respectable. But Argentine players know when to be tourists and when to 
pay attention. Their World Cup record proves it -- champions in 1978 and 1986 
and runners-up in 1930 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina's play in the 1990 tournament in Italy did its reputation little 
good. Soccer experts are fond of referring to certain styles of play as 
"cynical," by which they mean that teams abandon conventional tactics in favor 
of ruthless tackling and defensive protectionism. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship game against West Germany was universally panned. Paul 
Gardner, in his book "The Simplest Game," called it a "truly awful, totally 
forgettable final." 
</P>
<P>
 Four Argentine players were suspended for the final, including potent forward 
Claudio Caniggia. Maradona was barely fit because of a severely swollen ankle. 
Carlos Monzon became the first player in Cup history to be ejected from the 
final, and Argentina played on with only 10 men. Another was lost to ejection 
soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 When Germany scored on a penalty kick five minutes from the end, Argentina 
became the only team to fail to score in a final. 
</P>
<P>
 The shards of that team remain. Maradona is back and his meaning to the team 
cannot be underestimated. The soap opera that is Maradona has had him 
threatening to quit the team on many occasions, most recently when the mother 
of another player charged that Maradona had too much influence on roster 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Caniggia, a quick and dangerous forward, has just come off a 13-month 
suspension for cocaine use and appears to be back in form. Lest his return be 
trumpeted too loudly, however, Caniggia launched this preemptive strike: "Don't 
start billing me as a savior." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other question marks. Veteran defender Oscar Ruggeri, who has played 
on two World Cup teams, might have seen better days. Forward Gabriel Batistuta 
might have lost something when his Italian team, Fiorentina, was demoted to the 
second division. 
</P>
<P>
 Goycochea, yesterday's hero, has lost his starting job with his Argentine 
club, River Plate. The midfield, long Argentina's strength, has had trouble 
communicating. Fernando Redondo and Diego Simeone have sent mixed signals, as 
have the forwards, Abel Balbo and Caniggia. 
</P>
<P>
 They are all privately critical of the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, everything is perfect for Argentina. It should do well.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP E PREVIEW; A NORWEGIAN CRUISE; 
SCANDINAVIANS QUALIFIED IMPRESSIVELY, HAVE SIGHTS SET ON EVEN BIGGER PRIZE

<P>
 Norway is not known as a soccer power, but in 1993 it took the sport to heart 
as never before when the national team qualified for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a soccer Cinderella story that captivated the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only were the Norwegians able to qualify for the first time since 1938 and 
only the second time in their history, they did so despite being in the same 
group as such traditional powers as England, the Netherlands and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We honestly did not expect to go through," 28-year-old defender Gunnar Halle 
said, "and we certainly never imagined we would finish on top of the qualifying 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We surprised ourselves a little bit. I thought Holland and England would 
qualify, but we played well, got a bit of luck and stayed in front." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is where the Norwegians finished. They won their qualifying group 
with seven victories, two ties and only one defeat -- away to Turkey in their 
final, ultimately meaningless game. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way they outscored their opponents, 25-5, and set all sorts of 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 The first came in Norway's first game, a 10-0 victory over San Marino in Oslo. 
It was the biggest margin of victory in a World Cup qualifying match in Europe 
since West Germany beat Cyprus, 12-0, en route to the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is easy to say that they were very bad," said Norway's colorful and 
outspoken coach, Egil Olsen, "but some of our goals were pearls!" 
</P>
<P>
 There were more surprises to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks after beating San Marino, Norway played the Netherlands in 
Oslo and, to the delight of its fans, scored a 2-1 victory, its first over the 
Dutch in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch superstar Marco Van Basten had warned his teammates not to take the 
Norwegians lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scandinavian soccer has a strong wind in its sails," he said. "Even though 
Norway has not been in any finals for a very long time, it is an opponent one 
has to be sharp to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 The triumph over the Netherlands had Olsen praising his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this win we have broken a barrier in Norwegian soccer's long history," 
he said. "For the first time, we beat one of the world's top soccer nations, 
one that came to Oslo and took us seriously from the first minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Previously, we have beaten Italy and England, but both those victories were 
because they underestimated the Norwegians." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Norway had signaled its growing power during qualifying play for the 
1992 European Championship when it scored a 2-1 victory over Italy in Oslo. But 
the victory over the Dutch meant even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few people thought we could beat Holland," said the team's veteran defender 
and captain, Rune Bratseth, "but we did. And we deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen said it was his team's tactical discipline that had thwarted the Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dutch were good, but they met a system they don't face elsewhere," he 
said, referring to his team's formation of four defenders, five midfielders and 
one forward. 
</P>
<P>
 With convincing victories in its first two matches, Norway suddenly looked 
capable of anything, and the country's newspapers were not slow in climbing 
aboard the Viking bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily Dagbladet showed a picture of Norwegian striker Goran Sorloth 
scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands and told its readers: "If you 
are going to remember anything in 50 years' time, you ought to hang this on the 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
 There were even better things to come. The team was confident and the players 
were eager, not nervous, about their match against England at London's Wembley 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe we can win," Bratseth said. "We have so much to gain for the game 
in Norway if we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway did not win, but its 1-1 tie was enough to earn a vital point and 
signal that Norway had arrived on the international scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still a long way to go yet," goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt said, "but 
it was every players' dream to come and get a point at Wembley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a case of England getting worse, but of Norway getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 Halle, one of many Norwegian players who play their club soccer in England, 
agreed that Norway's time had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have closed the gap on the rest of Europe in the past five years," 
he said at the time. "After beating Italy last year, the Netherlands last month 
and now drawing here (at Wembley), we don't fear any teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Bratseth put it more simply: "We were lucky, but good teams should be lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's World Cup opponents -- Mexico, Italy and Ireland -- would be 
well-advised to listen to former England Coach Graham Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not easy to play against a team that puts a block of players in front 
of you and plays zonal defense," Taylor said, "especially when they are capable 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Norway's players were so capable they went on to defeat England in 
Oslo, tie the Netherlands in Rotterdam and beat Poland twice on the qualifying 
road to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 When Norway assured itself of reaching the World Cup, the entire country went 
soccer mad, jumping into fountains with ice-cold water in the middle of the 
night and celebrating as if the World Cup had been won. 
</P>
<P>
 But Olsen and his players realize they are in for a difficult battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, for one, will want revenge for that defeat in 1992, a loss that helped 
cost it a place in the European Championship finals. Oddly enough, Italy was 
Norway's opponent in its only World Cup match so far -- a 2-1 loss after extra 
time in France in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico too will be a strong challenger, especially since the Norwegians are 
unaccustomed to the fluid style and refined skills of Coach Miguel Mejia 
Baron's team. And Ireland will be happy to provide a physical battle that 
Norway will not shun. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no weak teams in America," Halle said. "You cannot assume that 
an African team will be a simple matter, for instance, just as it is not safe 
for others to assume that a small country like Norway will be easy to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not be favorites, but that's how we like it. We were not favorites in 
our qualifying group either." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain: The Norwegian fans will be here in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Norway is soccer mad at the moment," Halle said during qualifying play. "I 
cannot imagine what it will be like by next summer."

<P>
 * COACH: Egil Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Rune Bratseth, Erik Thorstvedt, Jan Age Fjortoft. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Norway makes no apologies for using a virtually impregnable 
defense to get the results it desires. It is a frustrating team to watch and to 
play against because of this negative approach. Bratseth is a top-level sweeper 
with experience in the German Bundesliga. Several of the players are with 
English clubs, which could be a plus but probably is not. Goalkeeper Thorstvedt 
is experienced and reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Scoring goals is always going to be a problem for a team that 
emphasizes defense. There is a general lack of imagination about the 
Norwegians' play, but midfielder Jostein Flo and striker Fjortoft were in form 
at the end of the English season and scoring goals regularly, so perhaps there 
is hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: One previous appearance. Record of 0-1-0. Never advanced 
beyond the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: In Norway's official media guide, Olsen, the team's 
coach, lists his marital status as follows: "Living together with Sigrun, two 
children." He also claims to have made more money from playing poker than from 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: If the Norwegians can withstand the heat, their defense is enough 
to frustrate the Irish and Mexicans, and possibly even the Italians, and earn 
them a place in the second round. 
</P>

 * COACH: Jack Charlton. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Roy Keane, Tony Cascarino, Pat Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: The Irish might not be the most attractive team in the world to 
watch, but they have learned to perfection the art of harrying and disrupting 
opponents. Italy, Mexico and Norway will be given little chance to play with 
the ball. Keane and Cascarino are effective strikers. Bonner is the country's 
most-capped player and will need to be at his best. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: The loss of striker Niall Quinn to injury was a huge blow to 
Ireland's hopes, but it has recovered well enough to upset both the Dutch and 
Germans in warm-up games. Like other teams from colder climes, the heat and 
humidity will trouble the Irish, especially since their average age is higher 
than most. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: One previous appearance. Record of 0-1-4. Best finish was 
reaching quarterfinals in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Not one of Ireland's 22 players plays for a club in 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Ireland is in an extremely difficult group, having to face Italy, 
which it has not beaten and which knocked it out four years ago; Mexico, whose 
style is likely to confound the Irish; and Norway, a physically bruising and 
defensive-minded side. The latter match could be the dullest of the tournament. 
It is possible Ireland could advance as a third-place team, but probably not.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP E PREVIEW; SOME TOUGH IRISHMEN; 
PLAYERS AREN'T AFRAID TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR HANDS ON THE FIELD, BUT THEY 
MIGHT BE AFRAID OF BIG JACK 
</P>

<P>
 The coach lives in the center of a storm, criticized for his harsh treatment 
of players, chided for poor-mouthing his team, revered or despised but never 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 The players are smart, hard-working, selfless, forced to give up their 
individualism for the good of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans are loud, sometimes obnoxious, often partying from the morning of the 
game until the morning after. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame football? 
</P>
<P>
 No, we're talking about the real fighting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 Introducing Ireland's promising World Cup soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 Please, shake their hands, they could be on the verge of making history. 
</P>
<P>
 Then duck. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from a shocking victory over defending champion Germany in Hanover -- 
the Germans' first loss at that home field in 56 years -- the Irish are ready 
to bruise their way to stardom in just their second World Cup appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, we don't actually tackle the other guys, not like your American 
football," protested hard-hitting midfielder Steve Staunton during a phone 
interview from Dublin. "All we do is close the other guys down. We don't knock 
them down, we close them down." 
</P>
<P>
 Then why do European soccer observers talk about this team as if it were the 
Dallas Cowboy defense? 
</P>
<P>
 Why, when asked about the Irish offense, do experts change the subject to 
hitting and intimidating? 
</P>
<P>
 And exactly what are all the Irish opponents doing leaving the field with 
grass stains on their faces? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the other guys may fall, but they are not tackled," Staunton said. 
"Some of the guys just, uh, slip." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the Irish are doing, observers feel that if they do it well enough to 
survive a difficult group containing Italy, Mexico and Norway, they could 
advance even further than in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, they lost to the host Italians in the quarterfinals, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people in this country feel that if we can make it out of our group, we 
can win it," said Eamonn Gibson, columnist for the Irish Press daily newspaper 
in Dublin. "This team is not afraid of anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Liam Brady, considered the Joe Montana of Irish soccer, is just as optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "As well as we are playing now, I honestly think we will be tough to beat in 
the States," said Brady, 38, who is now coaching in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady is not a member of this team, nor the World Cup team in 1990, despite 
competing in 72 international matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason can be summed up in two words that are spoken more in Irish pubs 
than "Another round!" 
</P>
<P>
 Those words are Big Jack. As in, Jack Charlton, a former coal miner and member 
of the 1966 English World Cup champion who took over as the Irish coach in 
1986. He has since led them to a 40-11-25 record, even if it hasn't always been 
pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 When Charlton cut Brady from the 1990 team, it was only the first in a series 
of moves that has made him a strong presence on the previously quiet Irish 
soccer frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 If he doesn't like a player, that player is gone. If he doesn't like a 
question from a reporter, that press conference is over. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the feisty Irish journalists would ever dare imitate their British 
counterparts by criticizing their coach personally? 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody ever calls me a name, I'll punch them in the nose," Charlton, 59, 
said to Irish reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But, well, he wins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a tough coach if you understand football," Charlton said from Dublin. 
"I know how the game should be played. And if the players play it my way, they 
won't have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Three consecutive victories over World Cup teams certainly do not constitute a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that his team doesn't have other problems, according to Charlton, whose 
sorry public appraisals of his team would make even Lou Holtz blush. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a big fish in the sea, we're just little ol' Ireland," Charlton 
said. "We're a 33-to-1 shot . . . and that's about right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish could have a problem in the heat of the many midday World Cup games. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ask me, it all depends on the heat," Staunton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about these players might be that they look like an English 
team, they talk like an English team . . . and actually should be an English 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason that the English did not qualify for the World Cup this year might 
have been that many of their best players are playing for Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Only seven of the 22 players were born in Ireland. They all qualified for the 
team because their parents or grandparents were born in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 And none of the 22 play in Irish leagues. All but two play in England. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's fair to make a big deal of that," said Staunton, one of 12 
players returning from the 1990 World Cup team. "A lot of players here, their 
parents couldn't get jobs in Ireland and so they moved to England. You can't 
blame us for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Other key returnees from the 1990 squad include goalkeeper Pat Bonner, 
defenders Paul McGrath and Kevin Moran, midfielders Ray Houghton, Andy Townsend 
and John Sheridan, and forwards Tony Cascarino and John Aldridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Most impressive among the newcomers is midfielder Roy Keane, who competes for 
world power Manchester United in England. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Charlton prefers, nobody on this team is a hero. But together, come 
July 17, there might be no bigger heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know a lot of people in the United States are from Ireland, we know we're 
going to hear a lot of cheering," Staunton said. "We're going to try to give 
them a good show."

<P>
 * COACH: Arrigo Sacchi. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Roberto Baggio, Giuseppe Signori, Franco Baresi. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Tradition is on the Italians' side, as is the fact that the fans 
will be there for them in large numbers. Baggio won the coaches' vote as the 
world's best player for 1993. Signori is a proven finisher, having led the 
Italian League in scoring each of the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: As in all tournaments, Italy will be under tremendous pressure 
to perform, especially after the disappointment of four years ago when it 
managed only a third-place finish at home. Sacchi has tried a variety of 
combinations but none seem to have clicked. Baresi is past his best as a 
defender and might be exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Twelve previous appearances. Record of 31-11-12. Winner 
in 1934, 1938 and 1982; runner-up in 1970; third in 1990; fourth in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: In 1934, Italy played its first World Cup match and 
scored a 7-1 victory in Rome. Its opponent was the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: It will be tough going, but Italy should win its first-round group 
and then advance to at least the quarterfinals. If the team can finally come 
together, the potential is there for it to reach the final, but Germany is a 
huge obstacle and already has the psychological edge, having beaten the 
Italians in warm-up play.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP E PREVIEW; REBIRTH OF A NATION; AFTER 
1990 WORLD CUP BAN, MEXICO SEEKS REDEMPTION 
</P>

 There is nothing subtle about the pressure on the Mexican World Cup team. As 
the team left Mexico City for the United States and its quest to reclaim its 
country's soccer pride, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari addressed 
the team: "I am sure that you rely on the confidence that comes from having 
prepared well and, fundamentally, you count on the aid and enthusiasm of all 
Mexican fans." 
</P>
<P>
 After the political niceties, Salinas let the team know his expectations: 
"Take heart, and onward to victory!" 
</P>
<P>
 Easy for him to say. Salinas and the rest of Mexico realize this is the 
country's best chance to re-establish its reputation as a soccer power -- with 
a new coach and a young and disciplined team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this is the 10th time Mexico has played in the World Cup final, 
Mexico's soccer fans are most eager to erase the memory of sitting home in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican soccer federation was hit with a two-year ban for using over-age 
players in a youth tournament in 1988 and was not allowed to compete in the 
last World Cup. This one is for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to promise anything but our effort and dedication," Coach 
Miguel Mejia Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a typically understated comment from Mejia Baron, who is credited with 
taking Mexico's national team from the category of talented but disappointing 
to its current status as one of the tournament's eight-best teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia Baron is the architect of Mexico's new look, which emphasizes teamwork 
and organization over the selfish, ball-hogging style formerly favored by 
Mexican teams. Their look-at-me flair was undeniably appealing, but yielded 
only sporadic results. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Mejia Baron, who left a flourishing dental practice to take over the 
national team after the abrupt departure of Argentine Cesar Luis Menotti in 
January of 1993. Mejia Baron had been a player for the powerful Pumas club of 
Mexico City through the '60s and '70s. He brilliantly guided Mexico through 
World Cup qualifying -- his team was the first to qualify for the finals and 
won five of its last six qualifying matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia Baron earned the respect of his players when he supported them in a 
threatened strike over free agency in the Mexican professional league last 
season. Mejia Baron needed the resulting good will to convince the players to 
accept the discipline of his system. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia Baron was intent on doing one thing -- driving the Mexican offense 
forward. His system takes a common 4-4-2 and converts it to a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 on 
the attack. Swift midfielders make the whole thing possible as does Mexico's 
most unusual weapon, the keeper/sweeper: Jorge Campos. 
</P>
<P>
 Menotti was fond of calling Campos "the goalkeeper of the 21st Century" for 
his penchant for coming well off the line to make saves and then press forward 
on the attack. His position well in front of the penalty area discourages 
counterattacks. 
</P>
<P>
 His confidence as a field player is well earned. Campos plays as a forward for 
his club team, Pumas, and in 1989 he led the team in scoring. Last summer when 
Mexico played the U.S. national team in the Gold Cup final in Mexico City, 
Campos played the first half in goal and the second as a forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos, who grew up in Acapulco and had dreams of becoming a professional 
surfer, is a self-effacing man whose steely presence on the field has a calming 
effect on his team. While he was in goal, Mexico went 9-2-1 in qualifying and 
Campos had seven shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel special," Campos said. "I just try to not to make a mistake. 
Nobody is special. We are all the same on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 His ability to control the ball with his feet gives Mexico an added field 
player, hence the keeper/sweeper description. Like Rene Higuita of Colombia, 
Campos' style can also be risky. Although he uses his quickness to recover and 
get back, it is inevitable that Campos will give up a goal while out of 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach has its critics, but Mejia Baron is comfortable with Campos' 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football's a game of risk and we accept the risk Campos takes," he said. "He 
has the backing of his team and the coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Old questions about Mexico's consistency arose in the months before the World 
Cup. First came a tie against Bulgaria. An embarrassing 5-1 loss to Switzerland 
followed in January, and a 4-1 loss to Russia a week later. Critics 
acknowledged that Mexico had talent but that its players crumpled under 
pressure and reverted to their old, individualistic habits. That, plus the fact 
that Mexico's smaller players might be manhandled by Group E World Cup 
opponents -- Italy, Ireland and Norway -- could make things difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 When the added pressure of being, as some would argue, the second "home" team 
in the World Cup is factored in, Mexico's expectations of reaching the 
semifinals would seem fanciful. 
</P>
<P>
 But not if the team can crank up its offense to the levels of World Cup 
qualifying. Luis Roberto Alves, known as Zaguinho, equaled the world record for 
goals in a full international, scoring seven times against Martinique. In 
Alves, Mexico might have found a young, more mobile version of the venerable 
Hugo Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Mexico City but raised in Brazil, Alves took his soccer-playing 
father's nickname, Zague, meaning zig-zag. Zaguinho means little Zague. At 18 
he joined his father's old team, Pumas, and scored the winning goal in his 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alves gained attention on the national team during last summer's CONCACAF Gold 
Cup, when he scored 11 goals in five matches. Yet, during the Copa America, 
Mejia Baron benched Alves in favor of Sanchez. Only when another player was 
injured was Alves added to Mexico's roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Alves came on in the second half of the opening game against Colombia, 
replacing Sanchez, and scored. Alves started every game after that. Mexico, 
performing beyond expectations, lost the final to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia Baron has convinced Alves to offer midfield support to bolster his 
system of complex passes that begins from the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have to do is take the battle to them by playing the ball on the 
ground, which is what we are best at," Mejia Baron said recently. "And, of 
course, keep the ball moving around, because that's the key to beating the 
European players." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach has assembled players who embrace his philosophy of attack. 
Defensively, Ramon Ramirez is often brought up to join the attack. Like Campos, 
Ramirez plays forward for his club team. Ignacio Ambriz and Alberto Garcia Aspe 
are candidates at midfield. Up front are Luis Garcia -- who plays in Spain for 
Athletico Madrid -- and the Mexican league's top two scorers from last season, 
Carlos Hermosillo and Luis Salvador.

<P>
 * COACH: Miguel Mejia Baron. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Hugo Sanchez, Luis Roberto (Zaguinho) Alves, Jorge Campos. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Mexico has rebounded into the international forefront over the 
past two or three years, with players such as striker Luis Garcia, defender 
Ramon Ramirez and goalkeeper Campos all catching the eye. Sanchez can still 
provide the passes that lead to goals and Zaguinho can find the net in all 
sorts of ways. Campos can be an asset or a liability, depending on the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Lack of confidence seems to be the Mexicans' main problem. They 
should have handled the United States with ease at the Rose Bowl, but instead 
of maintaining pressure on the Americans they let their heads drop when 
frustrated and physically challenged and wound up losing, 1-0. Campos' habit of 
trying to be a "sweeper-keeper" could cost the team dearly, just as it did 
Colombia's Rene Higuita in 1990. Injury apparently has diluted Ramirez's 
effectiveness as an overlapping left back. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Nine previous appearances. Record of 6-17-6. Best finish 
was in reaching the quarterfinals in 1970 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Hugo Sanchez is the only one of all 528 players in the 
1994 tournament to have taken part in the 1978 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Unless it can raise its game back to the level of 1993, when it won 
the CONCACAF Gold Cup and finished second in the Copa America, Mexico will be 
lucky to squeak into the second round as a third-place team.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP F PREVIEW; ORANGE CRUSH?; THE 
NETHERLANDS' RE-EMERGENCE TIED TO MESHING OF OLD AND NEW

<P>
 Ask any soccer fan to name the five greatest players ever and, chances are, 
Johan Cruyff would be high on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Voted European player of the year in 1971, 1973 and 1974, Cruyff was a player 
of sublime skills, a forward who ranked alongside Pele, Diego Maradona, Franz 
Beckenbauer and George Best as the greatest of their generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruyff inspired the Dutch national team in the 1970s, the player whose 
sparkling talent led his country to the 1974 World Cup final, which the 
Netherlands lost to West Germany, 2-1, in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, the Dutch, still under the leadership of Coach Rinus Michels 
but now without Cruyff, again reached the final. This time, they lost to 
Argentina, 3-1, in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 That marked the end of an era. The brilliant Dutch team of the '70s passed 
into history. The era of "Clockwork Orange" and "Total Football" was over. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Dutch could not win the World Cup with players such as Cruyff, Johan 
Neeskens, Johnny Rep and Ruud Krol in their ranks, they never would win it. At 
least that was the theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, flash forward to the 1980s. The great Dutch clubs of Ajax Amsterdam, 
Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven again had produced a collection of superb players. 
Holland's new stars were Marco Van Basten, Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and 
Ronald Koeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their predecessors, they dominated the European scene. Gullit was 
selected European player of the year in 1987. Van Basten won the same honor in 
1988, 1989 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, and still under Michels' guidance, they achieved the Netherlands' 
greatest triumph by winning the 1988 European Championship in Germany, a feat 
that sparked a national celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, however, the Dutch team was beginning to fade. Injuries and time had 
taken their toll. At that year's European Championship, in Sweden, the stars of 
the '80s burned brightly one last time in a thrilling 3-1 quarterfinal victory 
over Germany, but the Dutch then lost the semifinal on penalty kicks to 
eventual champion Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Basten, of all people, saw his decisive kick saved. Another era of Dutch 
soccer had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, flash forward again. It is 1994. The Dutch team has qualified for the 
World Cup in the United States. And who are the names being talked about? 
Cruyff? Van Basten? Gullit? Michels? 
</P>
<P>
 How could this be? 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer has come full circle. Twenty years after losing the World Cup final in 
Germany, the Dutch again are among the favorites to win the 1994 title. 
</P>
<P>
 They would have been favored even more had it not been for four factors. 
</P>
<P>
 After agreeing to take over as coach of the national team if it qualified for 
the finals, Cruyff no longer will be involved. He and the Dutch federation 
failed to see eye-to-eye on his financial and other demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commentators in Holland were astounded and angered by Cruyff's stance, 
which they considered arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barcelona coach's demands allegedly included a 10% share of the Dutch 
federation's profits from the World Cup, the right to wear his own brand of 
sportswear (and not that of the Dutch team's sponsor) and the refusal to have 
his photograph used commercially as part of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 With Cruyff out of the picture, the Dutch federation gave the World Cup 
coaching job to Dick Advocaat, who had successfully steered Holland into the 
finals. Advocaat has something else in his favor -- experience in the United 
States. He played for the Chicago Sting of the defunct North American Soccer 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 But will Advocaat be able to motivate the team as well as Cruyff? Indeed, will 
some of the stars even play well for him? 
</P>
<P>
 "Making comparisons is all part and parcel of the game," Advocaat said, "but I 
can live with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have complete confidence that we can get excellent results. We have the 
players to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gullit, long a Cruyff supporter, refused to play for Advocaat in the 
qualifying matches and his participation in the World Cup was in doubt. Then, 
after enjoying a tremendous season with Sampdoria in Italy, the dreadlocked 
Dutchman, now 31, again became part of the coach's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But only briefly. After appearing for the Netherlands in a well-earned victory 
over Scotland and playing well, Gullit inexplicably quit. This time, it was for 
good. He gave no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise move, Advocaat then turned to 29-year-old Van Basten, who has 
been struggling to recover from ankle surgery for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Basten at first agreed to replace Gullit. Then, under pressure from AC 
Milan, his club team, he changed his mind and said he would not accept 
Advocaat's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Turmoil in the Dutch squad is par for the course, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth factor that might hurt Dutch chances this summer is the age of some 
key players. Defender Koeman, for example, is 30 and has lost a step or two. 
But his ability to win a match with a single wicked, curving free kick makes 
him indispensable. Koeman, who plays for Cruyff at Barcelona, is said to have 
the most powerful shot in soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Rijkaard, 29, who is playing as well as ever, having left AC 
Milan this season to return to Ajax Amsterdam. Midfielder Jan Wouters, at 33, 
is another veteran who has seen better days but is still playing well. 
</P>
<P>
 And a new generation of Dutch stars is beginning to emerge. Striker Dennis 
Bergkamp is regarded as one of the finest forwards in the world and a potential 
World Cup star. Others who could leap to prominence this summer include forward 
Peter van Vossen, Bryan Roy, Aron Winter and Marc Overmars and defender Ulrich 
Van Goebbel. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the mark of the Dutch team's resilience that only a couple of days after 
the Gullit bombshell it trounced Hungary, 7-1, as if to emphasize that all was 
not lost. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are Holland's prospects? 
</P>
<P>
 If Koeman and Rijkaard can shine one last time, if Advocaat can successfully 
blend yesterday's stars with the stars of tomorrow, then the Netherlands must 
be considered a serious candidate to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch task in the first round is not an especially difficult one. Holland 
has been grouped with its European neighbor, Belgium, as well as Saudi Arabia 
and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd twist, Saudi Arabia was formerly coached by Leo Beenhakker, a former 
coach of the Netherlands. Beenhakker was fired and replaced by Argentina's 
Jorge Solari. The Dutch should make the second round with ease, and their 
progress after that will depend on which teams they meet on the road to the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they go all the way, they will take their fans with them and the 
Pasadena stadium will be turned into a sea of orange. Dutch fans are the most 
colorful, if not bizarre, in the world, with a passion for outrageous costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the cameras focus on the painted faces in the crowd, soccer fans 
will be looking for the patterns being woven on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 And what if Holland and the United States should meet? What an odd coincidence 
that would be. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. federation recently named Rinus Michels as its director of coaching. 
And Michels used to coach the L.A. Aztecs, who used to play in the Rose Bowl 
and had Cruyff as their star player. 
</P>
<P>
 A Netherlands-United States final in Pasadena is an unlikely scenario, but it 
would make the circle complete.

<P>
 * COACH: Dick Advocaat. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Frank Rijkaard, Dennis Bergkamp, Ronald Koeman. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Bergkamp is developing into one of the world's best strikers, 
even though he had a relatively poor first season in Italy. Rijkaard, the only 
member of AC Milan's former world-beating Dutch trio to make the trip (Ruud 
Gullit left the team, Marco Van Basten is recovering from injury) provides the 
know-how in midfield, and Koeman is a free-kick specialist. The Dutch also 
attack well down either wing. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: There is turmoil in the camp, as usual. Gullit walking out on 
the team was a blow, as was Van Basten first saying yes, then no, to joining 
the squad. Koeman is 31 and his lack of mobility and pace has been exposed on 
occasion recently. He is also prone to professional fouls when beaten, 
something that definitely will result in a red card in '94. The goalkeeping has 
yet to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Five previous appearances. Record of 8-6-6. Best finish 
was as runner-up in 1974 and 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: In 1967, as a 19-year-old, Advocaat played for San 
Francisco in the United Soccer Assn., one of the forerunners of the North 
American Soccer League. He later played for three seasons with the NASL's 
Chicago Sting. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The first round should be a breeze, even if the Dutch suffer in the 
heat and humidity. Thereafter, it gets tougher. A semifinal place is not beyond 
the realm of possibility, but Colombia and Brazil loom large on the 
Netherlands' horizon.

 * COACH: Jorge Solari. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Majed Mohammed, Khaled Al Muwallid, Sami Al Jaber. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Saudi Arabia is one of the rising soccer powers in its part of 
the world. The government, that is to say, the royal family, has spent millions 
of dollars on the sport over the past 18 years or so and has been rewarded 
first with an Olympic Games appearance in 1984, an under-17 world championship 
in 1989 and now a World Cup appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: The Saudis change coaches at the drop of a burnoose, sending 
them packing whenever things go wrong. As a result, the players always are 
changing training methods and tactics. Small wonder they have had little 
success outside Asia and the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: First appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: In gratitude for having qualified for the World Cup for 
the first time in the nation's history, the Saudi government reportedly gave 
each player a luxury car and $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The team is one of the youngest, if not the youngest, in the 
tournament. It will struggle against such experienced powers as the Netherlands 
and Belgium but will put up a fight against Morocco in the hope that a victory 
might put it in the second round.

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP F PREVIEW; SOCCER'S JET SET; THAT 
WOULD BE SAUDI ARABIA, WHICH IS STILL FLYING HIGH AFTER QUALIFYING FOR THE 
FIRST TIME 
</P>

<P>
 In its first World Cup appearance, the team from Saudi Arabia will feature 
many excited men hopping along the sidelines, waving arms, slapping backs, 
shouting instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's only the royal family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudi players? The way they look at it, after you've whipped Iran, what's 
left? 
</P>
<P>
 After that momentous 4-3 qualifying victory in October, it might be a tad 
tough to get inspired for Belgium, Morocco and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, just making the World Cup was a major achievement," said Adel 
Al-Jubeir, spokesman for the Saudi Embassy. "We have already met or exceeded 
most of the expectations for us." 
</P>
<P>
 That won't explain the 50 or so relatives of King Fahd who will attend Saudi 
Arabia's first game June 20 against the Dutch in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your president gets involved in sports in this country, it's the same thing 
with us," Al-Jubeir said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. The Saudi royalty will do more than crowd the sidelines and try to 
get into the game. Some of them even arrived here with the team three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This was evident when a member of the Saudi delegation phoned the bellman at 
the team's New Jersey hotel . . . and ordered a jet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis likely will fly home disappointed, even if they are riding first 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 The country has been taking soccer seriously for only 18 years. Its best 
international-style player, Majed Mohammed, nicknamed "Pele of the Desert," is 
suffering from a back injury and recently missed seven consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the team misses him, but the Saudis have won only two of their last 
10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think we have no chance," said Eduardo Solari, an assistant coach 
under brother Jorge. "Well, I think we have a chance against the Moroccans." 
</P>
<P>
 The Solari brothers would have a better chance if they knew their players on a 
first-name basis. They have been coaching the team for only four months. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that would have made George Steinbrenner blush, a couple of princes 
fired former Coach Jose Candido last year, only two days before the game 
against Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Beenhakker, a Dutchman, took over. But he lasted only four months before 
he was fired. Some said it was because the royal family was worried about him 
suffering mixed emotions in the World Cup opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Solari brothers, who were hired after King Fahd got their names from 
Argentine President Carlos Menem. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's biggest advantage is its youth and the obvious: The midday heat 
will not bother them. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, as much as any other soccer team coming to America this month, they know 
they will be among friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "After everything that has happened, we know how Americans feel about us, and 
we love them too," defender Muhammad Abdul Jawwad said. "We think they are 
cute." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the bit about destiny. The Saudis have been in the line of so 
many bullets in recent years, they wonder if this World Cup isn't a chance to 
show everybody that they have more than survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in our God, Allah, and our God says that if you work hard, you 
will get what you want," Abdul Jawwad said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he wasn't talking about airplanes.

<P>
 * COACH: Abdellah Ajri. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Mustapha Hadji, Mustapha El Haddaoui, Khalil Azmi. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: The heat should not be a problem, anyway. Midfielder Hadji, 22, 
is being hailed as the team's player of the future, while El Haddaoui is the 
only survivor from the successful 1986 squad. Goalkeeper Azmi was good enough 
to replace former African player of the year Badou Zaki and hang onto the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Lack of experience is the main problem, combined with a lack of 
any outstanding individual talent. The majority of the players are 
Moroccan-based, meaning they seldom face top-notch opposition. Chances of an 
upset over the Dutch or Belgians appear remote. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Two previous appearances. Record of 1-3-3. Best finish 
was in reaching the second round in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: The coach's name is not Abdellah Blinda, as widely 
reported, but rather Abdellah Ajri. Blinda is his nickname. It means "bluffer," 
and is taken from his fondness of poker. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Bleak. Unless it can stage an upset on the level of its 
performances in 1986, when it held England and Poland to ties, defeated 
Portugal and lost by only 1-0 to West Germany, Morocco is in for a tough time. 
The hope is that a victory over Saudi Arabia will propel it into the second 
round, but the Saudis are hoping the result is just the opposite so they might 
advance. 
</P>

WORLD CUP '94; WORLD CUP USA '94 / GROUP F PREVIEW; THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY; 
MOROCCO HAS BEEN AN AFRICAN SOCCER TRENDSETTER DESPITE INTERFERENCE AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Once, Morocco carried the banner for African nations in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, it was the first African nation to qualify for the tournament in 
modern times. In 1986, at Mexico, it was the first African nation to win its 
first-round group, beating Portugal and tying England and Poland. It narrowly 
missed upsetting a heavily favored German team, losing in the second round, 
1-0, on a last-minute free kick by Lothar Matthaeus. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, other African countries have challenged and surpassed Morocco's 
supremacy. Morocco didn't qualify for the 1990 World Cup, and it hasn't played 
well at the African Nations Cup. Its journey to the United States is something 
of a surprise, one not easily accomplished. But now the real pressure begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is 1970, 1986. The responsibility is stifling," Coach Abdellah Ajri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajri, a former international-level handball player, took over from Abdelkhalek 
Louzani before the last World Cup qualifying game, against Zambia. Louzani had 
been ordered by the Ministry of Youth and Sports to recall several players from 
their European clubs, and the clash in philosophies led to his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 If the meddlesome ministry wasn't enough, Ajri also must look over his 
shoulder at King Hassan II, an avid fan who called the coach several times 
before that game against Zambia. In addition, there has been tension between 
players summoned home from Europe and those who play at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to play with a Moroccan from the national league," said striker 
Mohamed Chaouch, who plays in France, for Nice. "They are very technical, but 
they always try too much. There is always something lacking." 
</P>
<P>
 Ajri's best European find was 22-year-old midfielder Mustapha Hadji, who was 
playing for Nancy in the French Second Division. Ajri coaxed him into playing 
for Morocco instead of France, and Hadji rewarded him with a strong national 
team debut in the 1-0 victory over Zambia that established him as a potential 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajri will need Hadji's talent and more if Morocco is to be competitive in 
Group F, which also includes the Netherlands, Belgium and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustapha El Haddaoui, also a midfielder, is the only returning player from the 
1986 team. El Haddaoui, 32, plays for the French team Angers. He has been 
bothered by a bad ankle this season and his fitness is questionable. However, 
Ajri appreciates El Haddaoui's experience. "If we trail, 1-0, he will be able 
to steady play," Ajri said. "He won't feel the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The scoring burden will fall primarily on striker Chaouch, who has spent most 
of his professional career in France. He led Morocco with five goals in 
qualifying play. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachid Daoudi, a midfielder who plays for Widad of Casablanca, scored three 
goals. Daoudi, who is known for his powerful left foot, plays a strong 
defensive game on the left side of the midfield and often shadows opponents' 
top scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, Noureddine Naybet, who plays in France for Nantes, is considered 
the key. He's calm, precise and good at defending against passes made in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajri's preparation was hampered when the sports ministry failed to arrange 
warm-up games against European national teams. He had hoped to arrange those 
games to get an idea of where his team stood but instead settled for training 
in France and playing various European clubs.

 * COACH: Paul Van Himst. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY PLAYERS: Enzo Scifo, Marc Degryse, Josip Weber. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRENGTHS: Solid but unspectacular best describes the Belgians. Forward 
Degryse is an intelligent and experienced player, but all eyes will be on 
Croatian-born striker Weber, the top scorer in the Belgian League each of the 
past two seasons but a newcomer to the national team.Scifo is the midfield 
general and the team's finest playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEAKNESSES: Difficult to pinpoint, but lack of flair and imagination best 
sums it up. Goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme is experienced, although perhaps past 
his prime. 
</P>
<P>
 * WORLD CUP HISTORY: Eight previous appearances. Record of 7-14-4. Best finish 
was fourth place in Mexico in 1986. 
</P>

 * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT: Van Himst, the coach, was Belgium's player of the year 
four times, the first time when he was only 16. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: No problems in the first round. The only question is, will Belgium 
or the Netherlands want to finish first in the group. The winner is likely to 
meet Brazil in the quarterfinals, while the runner-up might have an easier 
task. Gamesmanship could come into play. Unlikely to go beyond the final eight

MURDOCK STANDS FIRM AGAINST LOCAL INTERFERENCE IN BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year resident of Ventura County, billionaire David H. Murdock has made 
news as a local developer, philanthropist and international businessman. But he 
has rarely talked to reporters about any of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Murdock discussed not only his Sherwood Country Club 
development but also some of the local controversies in which he has been 
involved over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 He condemned local interference in private business, insisted he had never 
gained any special favors from county officials overseeing his Sherwood 
development and said his relocation of about 1,400 mature trees has led to the 
death of only six. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman and 23% stockholder of Dole Food Co., Murdock said he decided in 
1992 to locate the corporation's new red-brick, 650-employee world headquarters 
across the Los Angeles County line in Westlake Village because of policies in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not like the fact that in Thousand Oaks the like to tell you everything 
you can do and can't do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly irksome, he said, is a city law that controls the color of 
buildings, an ordinance that forced auto dealer Robert Nesen, a Sherwood 
director, to repaint a building deemed to be too white. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any governing body should have such rights," Murdock said. 
"When someone can tell you the color of your building, they have gone too far, 
in my book." 
</P>
<P>
 Murdock said he considered moving out of Ventura County entirely at one point, 
because of what he sees as unnecessary government interference in private 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not comment further. But he has had run-ins with county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, he won a high stakes tax dispute with the county assessor when a 
judge ruled that 200 blue-ribbon Arabian horses bred at Murdock's Ventura Farms 
qualified as race horses. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision brought Murdock an immediate refund of $115,000, since race 
horses are not taxed at their true value. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, a grand jury investigated Murdock's relationships with county 
officials and his attempt to gain county approval to force longtime Lake 
Sherwood residents to buy the lake for $2.6 million or pay high lake 
maintenance fees. 
</P>
<P>
 After county supervisors balked, Murdock withdrew his plan to sell the lake. 
He is now completing a long-term plan to maintain the lake at his own expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury found no criminal wrongdoing, but recommended creation of an 
ethics board to write a code of conduct for county employees. Murdock had 
hosted a barbecue for many officials overseeing his project in 1989, even 
though several key decisions were pending, grand jurors noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry, Murdock now says, was much ado about little. And Dist. Att. 
Michael D. Bradbury later wrote him a letter saying that he was not the focus 
of the inquiry, Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a source of a great deal of embarrassment to me," he said. "It was a 
lot of noise and not much action I know of. I was called to testify and I 
testified. That was all of it." 
</P>
<P>
 One needs only to look around at the beauty of his project to recognize what a 
plus it is for the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was anything here gotten improperly? . . . What was it?" he said. "I didn't 
get any great help I could see. The officials feel we have a very find 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 Another source of irritation were early complaints that Murdock would kill 
hundreds of ancient oak, red shank and sycamore trees by transplanting them 
around his golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "All too frequently people think just because you make money, you've got to 
make money by destroying," he said. "It's just the opposite here. I brought 
trees that no one could see and put them in places where people could see them. 
. . .I checked with our tree man the other day. We have lost six."
